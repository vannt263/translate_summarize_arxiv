    "hdf850.1 was the first sub  mm source discovered via unbiased , blank - field surveys at 850@xmath7 , its presence becoming apparent only @xmath8hr into the @xmath9 hr scuba imaging observation of the hubble deep field ( hdf ) undertaken by hughes et al .",
    "it was also the first scuba - selected source to be detected in continuum emission through mm - wavelength interferometry , with a further @xmath10hr of observations , this time with the iram pdb interferometer , yielding its position to an accuracy of @xmath11arcsec ( downes et al .",
    "1999 ) . frustratingly , however , despite this accurate position and the obvious availability of optical data of unparalleled depth and resolution , a convincing host galaxy for this bright sub - mm source has not yet been identified .",
    "indeed , the difficulty experienced in finding an optical counterpart for hdf850.1 has even motivated some authors to explore the possibility that some of the sub - mm sources uncovered via high galactic latitude scuba surveys are actually galactic objects ( lawrence 2001 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that even though the search radius permitted by the iram pdb results is small , this identification failure is _ not _ due to a lack of potential optical counterparts ( see fig .",
    "1 ) . indeed , both hughes et al . ( 1998 ) and downes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) noted that the galaxy 3 - 586.0 , one of the most obviously red objects in the three - colour image of the hdf , is not only consistent with the mm / sub - mm position of hdf850.1 , but is statistically rather unlikely to lie so close to the sub - mm / mm source by chance ( @xmath12 , because 3 - 586.0 is relatively bright ) .",
    "however , both hughes et al . and downes et al .",
    "rejected the possibility that this apparently favourable statistical association necessarily implies that 3 - 586.0 is the correct optical identification .",
    "this is because , while optical  near - infrared photometry of 3 - 586.0 strongly indicates it is a passively evolving elliptical at @xmath5 ( fernndez - soto et al .",
    "1999 ; rowan - robinson 2001 ) , existing sub - mm @xmath13 radio detections and limits yield an estimated redshift for the 850@xmath7 source of @xmath14 , and appear to exclude @xmath15 ( e.g. carilli & yun 1999 , 2000 ; dunne et al . 2000 ) . furthermore , as argued by downes et al .",
    ", it is not expected that such a quiescent elliptical should be a strong emitter of sub - mm radiation .",
    "consequently , hdf850.1 has become the classic test case of the extent to which the technique of estimating redshifts from sub - mm @xmath13radio photometry can be trusted , and indeed of the whole idea that many / most bright sub - mm sources lie at high redshift ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "given the apparent unsuitability of 3 - 586.0 , the two remaining potential high - redshift objects in the vicinity of hdf850.1 have both been considered as potential identifications .",
    "first , hughes et al . tentatively suggested 3 - 577.0 as the correct identification because , while statistically quite likely to lie close to the sub - mm position by chance ( @xmath17 ) , it appeared to be the only candidate within the scuba search radius with an estimated redshift in the appropriate range ( @xmath18 ; fernndez - soto et al . 1999 ; rowan - robinson 2001 , and a tentative spectroscopic redshift of @xmath19 ; zepf et al .",
    "subsequently , the improved iram pdb position excluded this object as a possible counterpart , and downes et al . concluded in favour of 3 - 593.1 .",
    "however , the relatively modest estimated redshift of this source ( @xmath20 ; fernndez - soto et al . 1999 ; rowan - robinson 2001 ) means that this option also appears unconvincing .",
    "one might reasonably ask why the correct identification for hdf850.1 has proved so elusive , given that several other comparably bright sub - mm sources have been discovered and unambiguously identified in the intervening years ( e.g. smail et al .",
    "1999 , ivison et al . 1998 , 2000 , gear et al .",
    "2000 , frayer et al .",
    "2000 , lutz et al .",
    "the most likely explanation is that hdf850.1 simply lies at a more extreme redshift than these identified sources .",
    "the strongest hint of this comes from the fact that these now identified scuba sources have been detected in the radio at @xmath21 , whereas hdf850.1 has evaded radio detection at the level of @xmath22 ( 3-@xmath23 ) .",
    "the radio investigation of hdf850.1 was temporarily confused by the suggestion of richards ( 1999 ) that the sub - mm source should be associated with the radio source vla 3651 + 1221 , some 6 arcsec south - west of the scuba position .",
    "this possibility was excluded shortly thereafter by the iram pdb detection . however , this diversion does at least serve to emphasize the dangers of making the ( initially understandable ) assumption that every scuba source can be reliably associated with a vla source provided one is found within a fairly generous search radius ( e.g. barger et al . 2000 ) , and confirms that any redshift distribution for the sub - mm population deduced from such scuba+vla associations should be regarded as conservative ( as noted by smail et al .",
    "in fact , to date the most promising radio counterpart of hdf850.1 is vla 3651 + 1226 , listed in the supplementary list of sources provided by richards et al .",
    "( 1998 ) as a 2.3-@xmath23 detection at 8.4ghz .",
    "subsequent re - analysis of these data has raised the significance of this detection to over 3-@xmath23 , with @xmath24@xmath25 .",
    "however , even if real , this 8.4-ghz detection is still consistent with the 1.4-ghz limit , and the fact that the observed radio flux - density from hdf850.1 is lower than that of comparably bright sub - mm sources which have already been successfully identified .",
    "in this paper we report new results which reveal the host galaxy of hdf850.1 to be a faint , extremely red object lying at @xmath14 .",
    "this conclusion follows from a detailed analysis of a new , deep ( @xmath2610-hr ) , high - quality ( 0.6-arcsec seeing ) @xmath0 image of the hdf obtained with the 8.2-m subaru telescope .",
    "this has revealed a new near - infrared counterpart to hdf850.1 , which we also find to be marginally detected in the hst nicmos f160w image of the hdf .",
    "our conclusion that this new , faint , red object is indeed the host of the sub - mm source is then strengthened by a re - analysis of the combined merlin+vla 1.4-ghz radio image of the hdf .",
    "this yields a 4-@xmath23 detection of hdf850.1 only 0.1 arcsec distant from the new near - infrared counterpart , and with sufficient positional accuracy to exclude all the previously - considered alternative optical candidates discussed above .",
    "we have also utilised this new radio detection in a calculation designed to set realistic confidence limits on the estimated redshift of hdf850.1 , and find @xmath4 . finally ,",
    "since this new discovery can not change the fact that the @xmath5 elliptical 3 - 586.0 is unlikely to lie so close to the sub - mm / mm / radio source by chance , we calculate the probability of the most likely explanation of this coincidence , namely that hdf850.1 is gravitationally lensed by 3 - 586.0 . this possibility has been considered before by hughes et al .",
    "and downes et al .",
    "( and indeed a lensing model for 3 - 586.0 was discussed by hogg et al .",
    "( 1996 ) prior to the discovery of hdf850.1 ) .",
    "however , a more accurate calculation can now be performed given the improved positional accuracy for hdf850.1 , new limits on the brightness of a counter image , and the accurate estimate of the mass of 3 - 586.0 which we have deduced from our detailed modelling of the infrared and optical images .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we briefly summarize all the multi - frequency information for hdf850.1 ( and its immediate vicinity ) which was available prior to this new study .",
    "then , in section 3 we describe the new @xmath0 data , and the results of the reanalysis of the merlin+vla 1.4ghz dataset . in section 4",
    "we explain how we analysed the @xmath0 image in two independent ways , and demonstrate that both methods reveal the same new candidate identification , which we hereafter refer to as hdf850.1k .",
    "we also show that a similar analysis of the existing hst nicmos f160w image of the hdf yields a marginal @xmath27-band detection of this object .    in section 5 we present photometric and astrometric information for hdf850.1k , summarize the properties of the elliptical 3 - 586.0 derived from our image analysis , and present new confidence limits on the estimated redshift of hdf850.1 . in section 6",
    "we draw this information together and provide a quantitative discussion of the likelihood that the new near - infrared identification is indeed the host galaxy of hdf850.1 .",
    "we also calculate the likely extent to which this source has been gravitationally lensed by the elliptical 3 - 586.0 .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of the implications of these new results for the sub - mm galaxy population in general , and for current estimates of star - formation density at high redshift . throughout this paper",
    "we assume a flat cosmology with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",
    "hdf850.1 was detected by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) at 850@xmath7 with a flux density of @xmath31mjy .",
    "this flux density , derived from the map , was also confirmed to within the errors by pointed photometric observations .",
    "the position of this object as derived from the original scuba map of the hdf was ( j2000 ) + ra 12@xmath32 36@xmath33 52.32@xmath34  dec + 62@xmath35 12@xmath36 26.3@xmath37 + the formal uncertainty in this position , based on the scuba beam size at 850@xmath7 , and the s / n of the detection was quoted by hughes et al . to be 0.7arcsec ( 1-@xmath23 ) in each dimension .",
    "this position , and the 1-@xmath23 errors , are marked by a cross in fig . 1 , and labelled ` scuba1 ' .",
    "a reanalysis of the hdf scuba map has recently been completed by serjeant et al . (",
    "2002 ) , using the maximum - likelihood source extraction technique described by scott et al .",
    "this yields a slightly different position for hdf850.1 ( albeit one consistent with the originally quoted formal uncertainty ) which is ( j2000 ) : + ra 12@xmath32 36@xmath33 52.22@xmath34  dec + 62@xmath35",

    "( 2002 ) also performed a series of simulations to estimate the effect of confusion noise on extracted source position in the scuba hdf map , and found that , even at the 7mjy level , the mean positional offset is @xmath38arcsec . in fig .",
    "1 we therefore also show this revised scuba position for hdf850.1 , labelled ` scuba2 ' , with a positional error of 1.5arcsec ( 1.1arcsec in each dimension ) .",
    "hughes et al . also derived a 450@xmath7 3@xmath23 upper limit of @xmath39mjy .",
    "as discussed by hughes et al . , a non - detection at this level constrains the redshift of hdf850.1 to @xmath40 , for the known range of far - infrared  to  sub - mm spectral energy distributions .",
    "finally , we note that serjeant et al .",
    "quote a somewhat smaller value for the 850@xmath7 flux density of hdf850.1 than hughes et al .",
    "( i.e. @xmath41mjy )",
    ". however , in this paper we adopt the originally quoted value of 7mjy , because this value is more consistent with the result derived from the pointed photometric observations .",
    "hdf850.1 was also detected by hughes et al . at 1.35 mm , and found to have a flux density of @xmath42mjy .",
    "this observation was made with a beam of fwhm 23arcsec , and so can safely be regarded as a measure of the total 1.35 mm flux density of the source . given this , the subsequent measurement of @xmath43mjy by downes et al .",
    "( 1999 ) within the @xmath44-arcsec beam of the iram pdb interferometer , indicates that the source is reasonably compact .    the 1.3-mm position measured for hdf850.1 by downes et al . is ( j2000 ) + ra 12@xmath32 36@xmath33 51.98@xmath34  dec",

    "this position is clearly consistent with the scuba position in the light of the revised uncertainty in the scuba astrometry discussed above .",

    "it can be seen that the position of this radio detection is consistent with both the scuba and iram positions .",
    "finally , also shown ( and labelled ) in fig .",
    "1 are the 3 optical objects 3 - 577.0 , 3 - 586.0 , and 3 - 593.1 which , as discussed in the introduction , have been previously considered as potential identifications by various authors .",
    "unfortunately , a spectroscopic redshift has yet to be determined for any of these objects despite , at least in the case of 3 - 586.0 , deep optical spectroscopy with the 10-m keck telescope ( stern , private communication ) .",
    "the colour - estimated redshifts for these 3 objects are @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 respectively ( fernandez - soto et al . 1999 ; rowan - robinson 2001 ) . in the case of 3 - 586.0",
    "the estimated redshift is relatively secure due to the fact that its broad  band sed so clearly mimics that expected from an evolved elliptical at @xmath5 , with a clear break between the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bands .",

    "( 1996 ) and downes et al .",
    "however , the @xmath53-arcsec errors on ra and dec given in these papers can now be revised down to @xmath54arcsec following the registration of the hdf optical image with the merlin image ( see section 3.2 ) to within an accuracy of 50milliarcsec .",
    "the new deep @xmath0 image of the hdf - n was obtained with the subaru 8.2-m telescope equipped with the nir camera cisco ( motohara et al . 1998 ) on april 34 , 2001 .",
    "full details of the observations and data reduction will be given in a future publication ( kajisawa et al .",
    ", in prep . ) . here",
    "we briefly summarize the data properties .",
    "the net on - source integration time is 10.2hr .",
    "the data were reduced in a standard manner ; each individual frame was flat - fielded and median - sky subtracted before the frames were combined .",
    "photometric calibration was peformed using ukirt faint standard stars observed at various altitudes during the observation , to produce @xmath56 magnitudes in the ukirt mauna kea system ( hawarden et al .",
    "we have ignored the @xmath57 colour correction , which introduces an uncertainty in the @xmath56 magnitude of the detected sources of at most 0.1mag depending on their spectra .",
    "the original pixel scale of cisco is 0.111 arcsec , but the images have been carefully resampled to match the wfpc2 drizzeled data ( see subsection 4.1 below ) .",
    "the seeing was @xmath58arcsec during the observations and the fwhm of stellar objects in the final image is @xmath59arcsec .",
    "the peak of the number counts of the detected sources reaches a magnitude of @xmath60 .",
    "a greyscale representation of the @xmath61arcsec sub - region of this image , centred on 3 - 586.0 , is shown in the top panels of fig .",
    "18days of merlin data and 42hours of a  array vla data at 1.4ghz have been combined to image radio sources in a 10-arcmin field centred on the hdf .",
    "this area includes both the hdf and the hubble flanking fields ( hff ) .",
    "these are the most sensitive 1.4-ghz images yet made , with rms noise levels of 3.3@xmath25/beam in the 0.2-arcsec resolution images ( muxlow et al .",
    "positions derived from the independent merlin and vla imaging are with respect to the international celestial reference frame ( icrf , ma et al .",
    "1998 ) , and agree to better than 15milliarcsec over the entire 10arcmin field .",
    "radio sources associated with compact galaxies have been used to align the hst wfpc2 optical fields to better than 50milliarcsec in the hdf itself , and to better than @xmath62milliarcsec in the outer parts of the hff ( muxlow et al .",
    "this astrometric alignment of the hst wfpc2 fields has been used by garrington , muxlow & garrett ( 2000 ) to argue that the position of hdf850.1 as measured by the iram telescope ( downes et al .",
    "1999 ) , again with respect to the icrf , precludes its identification with any galaxy visible on the hdf wfpc2 frame .    in that region of the hdf close to the position of hdf850.1 ,",
    "the high - resolution merlin+vla image has been smoothed to 0.6-arcsec resolution . in the smoothed image , an area of extended radio emission",
    "is detected between the elliptical galaxy 3 - 586.0 and the iram position for hdf850.1 .",
    "this detection is shown by the contours in fig .",
    "4a , where it can be seen that the radio emission splits roughly into two components , one partially overlaying the central region of 3 - 586.0 , and the other lying 0.5arcsec to the east of the iram position .",
    "fitting a two - dimensional gaussian to the latter radio component yields a flux of 16@xmath63 at the position given in table 2 . with an rms noise level of 3.7@xmath25/beam in the smoothed radio image ,",
    "the source detection is significant at better than the 4-@xmath23 level .",
    "the raw subaru @xmath0 image of the field shown in the top panel of fig .",
    "2 contains no obvious new candidate identification for hdf850.1 over and above those present in the hst wfpc2 optical images as discussed in section 2 .",
    "however , because of the extreme depth of this image , and the fact it has been taken from the ground ( albeit in excellent conditions , with a seeing disc fwhm of 0.6arcsec ) the objects in the vicinity of hdf850.1 appear considerably more extended than in the corresponding hst images . in particular ,",
    "near - infrared emission from the @xmath5 elliptical 3 - 586.0 is detectable out to an angular radius of @xmath38arcsec , and thus covers a significant region of the image within which the true identification of hdf850.1 could potentially lie .",
    "we therefore decided to attempt to remove the light of 3 - 586.0 from the @xmath0 image .",
    "this was done in two independent ways , first by subtracting an appropriately blurred and scaled version of the f814w image of the field , and second by fitting and removing a model representation of the elliptical from the @xmath0 image .",
    "as described below , these two alternative approaches yielded re - assuringly similar results .",
    "we have also performed a similar analysis on the hst nicmos camera-3 f160w image of the hdf ( dickinson et al .",
    "2002 ) and find that this yields a marginal @xmath27-band detection at the same position ( to within @xmath64arcsec ) as the @xmath0 detection .",
    "the @xmath0 image was interpolated onto the same pixel scale as the drizzled f814w image ( 0.04arcsec ) , and then @xmath61arcsec postage - stamp images were extracted at both wavelengths , centred on the fitted centroid of the elliptical 3 - 586.0 .",
    "the f814w image was then convolved with a gaussian , scaled to the same central peak height as the @xmath0 image , and subtracted from it .",
    "the fwhm of the convolving gaussian was varied until optimally clean subtraction of 3 - 586.0 from the residual image was achieved .",
    "the optimum fwhm was 0.57arcsec which , when added in quadrature to the intrinsic width of the hst f814w point spread function , makes good sense given the rms seeing of 0.6arcsec determined from the full @xmath0 image of the hdf .",
    "this process is summarized in fig .",
    "2 ( left - hand column ) which shows the @xmath0 image , the convolved f814w image , and the residual image . the small cross in the residual image marks the position of the centroid of 3 - 586.0 .",
    "it can be seen that the brightest source in this pseudo @xmath65 residual flux - density image is a small source , of visible angular extent @xmath66arcsec , lying 0.55arcsec distant from the projected centre of 3 - 586.0 .",
    "a model elliptical galaxy was fitted to the original 0.1-arcsec pixel subaru image of 3 - 586.0 using a 2-dimensional modelling code originally developed for modelling quasar host galaxies ( mclure , dunlop & kukula 2000 ) , incorporating 0.6-arcsec seeing .",
    "this model elliptical was then simply subtracted from the image to produce a second , alternative residual map of the field which was then interpolated onto 0.04-arcsec pixels for ease of comparison with the pseudo @xmath65 image discussed in the previous subsection .",
    "this process is also summarized in fig .",
    "2 ( right  hand column ) , which shows the raw @xmath0 image , the image of the best fitting de vaucouleurs model of 3 - 586.0 , and the residual image .",
    "all objects detected in the @xmath0 image other than 3 - 586.0 are obviously still present in this residual image , but the one new object revealed by this model subtraction process is once again a small source , of visible angular extent @xmath66arcsec , lying 0.55arcsec distant from the projected centre of 3 - 586.0 .      the drizzled f160w image of the hdf ( dickinson et al .",
    "2002 ) was interpolated onto the same pixel scale as the drizzled f814w image ( 0.04arcsec ) , and then @xmath61arcsec postage - stamp images were extracted at both wavelengths , centred on the fitted centroid of the elliptical 3 - 586.0 .",
    "the f814w image was then convolved with a gaussian of fwhm 3.5 pixels ( in an attempt to degrade it to a resolution comparable to that of the f160w image ) , scaled to the same central peak height as the f160w image , and subtracted from it .",
    "the result of this process was not as clean as that achieved using the @xmath0 image .",
    "in particular it produced a region of oversubtraction around the centroid of 3 - 586.0 ( at a radius @xmath67 arcsec ) presumably due to the difference between the gaussian - convolved wfpc2 psf and the more airy disc - like nicmos psf .",
    "however , attempts to resolve this problem using convolution with the f160w psf predicted by the tiny tim software did not produce any significant improvement .",
    "the resulting residual image should therefore be regarded with some caution . nevertheless , as shown in fig . 3 , ( which shows the nicmos f160w image , the convolved f814w image , and the residual image ) the brightest source in the central region of this pseudo @xmath68 residual flux - density image lies in exactly the same position , and has the same basic shape as the source revealed by the analysis of the @xmath0 image discussed above and illustrated in fig .",
    "the detection of a new source 0.55arcsec distant from 3 - 586.0 in the bottom - right panel of fig .",
    "2 shows that it is genuinely due to an excess of @xmath56-band flux - density , rather than some defect in the f814w image .",
    "conversely its presence in the bottom - left panel of fig .",
    "2 demonstrates that it is not simply an artefact of the model - fitting process due to , for example , the galaxy 3 - 586.0 not being well described by a smooth elliptical model .",
    "moreover , the similarity of this object in these two alternative residual images ( @xmath69 and @xmath65 ) means that this object must be undetected in the f814w image .    to quantify the significance of this new @xmath56 detection we have performed aperture photometry on both the alternative residual images described above . to quantify the significance of its non - detection in the @xmath51-band",
    ", we have also performed aperture photometry at the same position in a residual f814w image , produced by fitting and subtracting a 2-dimensional elliptical model to the f814w image of 3 - 586.0 . to obtain an estimate of its @xmath70 colour we have performed aperture photometry on the residual nicmos f160w image shown in the bottom panel of fig .",

    "the results of this photometry are given in table 1 .",
    "in summary , this new object ( which we hereafter call hdf850.1k ) is a faint , but clearly significant detection at @xmath56 with @xmath71 , and is an extremely red object , with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "as can be seen from table 1 , the faintness of hdf850.1k means that its @xmath56 magnitude has to be based on measurements made through relatively small software apertures ( @xmath74 arcsec ) .",
    "there is no evidence that hdf850.1k is significantly more extended than the 0.6-arcsec seeing disc in the sense that , correcting for the effects of seeing , the 0.5-arcsec measurement is certainly consistent with the 1.0-arcsec aperture measurement .",
    "however we can not rule out the possibility that , given imaging of sufficient depth , hdf850.1k might prove to be as extended as the @xmath56-band identification of lockman850.1 recently reported by lutz et al .",

    "1999 ) that none of the other plausible optical / ir counterparts ( 3 - 586.0 , 3 - 593.1 or 3 - 593.2 ) appear to have estimated redshifts consistent with that estimated for hdf850.1 , it seems highly probable that hdf850.1k is indeed the long - sought host galaxy of the brightest scuba source in the hdf .",
    "this probability is obviously further increased by the fact this object is an ero , with a colour very similar to that which has been found for other , sucessful scuba source identifications ( e.g. lutz et al .",
    "2001 ; ivison et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; smail et al . 1999",
    "; frayer et al . 2000 ) . however , perhaps most impressive of all , as illustrated in fig .",
    "4b , is the essentially exact astrometric coincidence of hdf850.1k with the tentative detection of hdf850.1 in the combined merlin+vla 1.4-ghz image discussed above in section 3.2 which yields a new radio position for hdf850.1 accurate to 0.1arcsec .",
    "the astrometric information for the various detections of hdf850.1 as a function of frequency is summarized in table 2 .",
    "the probability that hdf850.1k is the correct identification of hdf850.1 is quantified and discussed in more detail in section 6.1 , while the possible effects of lensing by 3 - 586.0 are discussed in section 6.2 .",
    "however , to better inform this discussion we first consider what can be learned about 3 - 586.0 from the optical - infrared image analysis presented here , and also calculate what new constraints can be placed on the estimated redshift of hdf850.1 incorporating its new detection at 1.4ghz .    .near - infrared  to  radio photometry of hdf850.1 [ cols=\"<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      although the results of this study indicate that the flux density of hdf850.1 has almost certainly been boosted by gravitational lensing , the inferred magnification factor is relatively modest , @xmath79 .",
    "there is also no evidence to support the existence of a similar lensing system for any of the other hdf scuba sources .",
    "this is not surprising since it is the brightest source uncovered that is statistically most likely to be significantly lensed , and the occurrence of one case of lensing within the 5 sources reported by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is certainly consistent with the estimates of lensing prevalence given above .",
    "it therefore seems reasonable to simply scale down the intrinsic sub - mm luminosity of hdf850.1 by a factor of 3 , for the purpose of re - calculating the total comoving star - formation density of the 5 scuba sources in the hdf .",
    "this produces a reduction of @xmath45 30% in the estimate of comoving star - formation density reported by hughes et al .",
    "this study has provided a particularly striking demonstration of the importance of ultra - deep near - infrared and radio imaging for the successful identification of even the brightest of sub - mm selected sources .",
    "the contrast between the sub - mm and optical views of the hdf could hardly be more striking , with the host galaxy of the brightest sub - mm source in this field transpiring to be one of faintest and reddest objects ever uncovered at near - infrared / optical wavelengths . at such imaging depths sub - arcsec astrometric accuracy",
    "is clearly crucial if an unambiguous identification is to be secured .",
    "it is obviously unrealistic to expect that multi - frequency data of this depth and quality will be easily achieved for large samples of bright sub - mm sources .",
    "it is therefore worth briefly revisiting what would have been concluded about hdf850.1 without the enormous investment of observing time made with the iram pdb interferometer , vla+merlin , and most recently subaru . as discussed at the beginning of this paper ,",
    "on the basis of statistical association one would have concluded that hdf850.1 was hosted by the @xmath5 elliptical galaxy 3 - 586.0 .",
    "alternatively , given the growing evidence that scuba source host galaxies are eros , and given the uncertainty in raw scuba - source positions , another apparently plausible ( and statistically likely ) conclusion would be that hdf850.1 is hosted by the nearby ( 5-arcsec distant ) ero which is also the nearest obvious chandra and vla source ( vla 3651 + 1221 ) .",
    "the former error would lead to the conclusion that hdf850.1 lies at relatively modest redshift , and that sub - mm  radio sed - based redshift estimation can not be trusted .",
    "the latter error would lead to the conclusion that hdf850.1 is an agn .",
    "in fact of course neither of these previously possible conclusions can now be viewed as tenable , and we find that hdf850.1 does indeed appear to be a violently star - forming galaxy at @xmath14 , which could never be discovered via lyman - break selection techniques .",
