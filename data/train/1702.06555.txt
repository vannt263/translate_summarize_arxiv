    "the youngest galactic supernova remnant g1.9 + 0.3  @xcite has provided important new information on the very early development of a supernova remnant ( snr ) as it interacts with the immediate sn environment .",
    "its rapid expansion ( @xmath8 km s@xmath1 , for a presumed distance of 8.5 kpc ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c11 ) allows the study of expansion over relatively short time baselines . in , we compared observations in 2007 ( epoch i ) and 2009 ( epoch ii ) in x - rays to obtain a mean expansion rate of 0.642% @xmath9 0.049% yr@xmath1 , or a mean expansion age of @xmath10 yr .",
    "assuming a mean deceleration rate @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) of about @xmath13 , this implies a remnant age of 100 yr .",
    "however , the expansion is far from uniform .",
    "a much longer ( 1 ms ) observation in 2011 ( epoch iii ) allowed the detection of departures from uniformity in expansion along the major axis ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) : the expansion varies systematically with radius , decreasing from @xmath14 yr@xmath1 to @xmath15 yr@xmath1 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter b14 ) . this difference was ascribed either to asymmetry in the surrounding medium , or in the ejecta themselves , indicating a significantly anisotropic explosion .",
    "we have now obtained an additional observation in x - rays of 400 ks ( 2015 ) which allows the further study of nonhomologous expansion in g1.9 + 0.3 .",
    "these observations should inform ongoing work on modeling g1.9 + 0.3 .",
    "the high expansion velocities , absence of an obvious pulsar - wind nebula , and bilateral symmetry of the x - ray emission ( as in sn 1006 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that g1.9 + 0.3  originated in a type ia event .",
    "the detailed dynamics can then provide clues to the nature of these explosions , at an age when ejecta still dominate the dynamics . thermal emission from si , s , and fe in isolated regions has allowed a picture to be drawn of highly anisotropic , overturned material @xcite .",
    "one mystery , evident from the earliest x - ray observations , was the difference in morphology between radio and x - ray . the radio image ( fig .",
    "[ radio ] ) shows a broad maximum across the northern rim , rather than bilaterally symmetric rims in the se and nw . since all the emission is synchrotron",
    ", this morphological contrast is puzzling .",
    "sn 1006 , for instance , has virtually identical images in radio and nonthermal x - rays @xcite .",
    "the simplest explanation involves assuming that radio - bright but x - ray faint regions result from an energy distribution of relativistic electrons that is larger than that from x - ray bright regions at radio - emitting energies of order 1 gev , but which cuts off before reaching x - ray emitting energies .",
    "one must then search for a mechanism to produce such differences .",

    "the exposure - weighted time interval @xmath16 between epochs iii and iv is 4.057 yr . while shorter 49.6 ks epoch i and 237 ks epoch ii observations provide longer time baselines ( 8.331 yr and 5.918 yr , respectively ) , this advantage is more than offset by the increased counting noise compared to the long epoch iii observations . therefore , the expansion measurements described here are based on the epoch iii and iv observations alone .    images , @xmath17 in size , were extracted from the merged event files by binning event positions to half the acis pixel size , so one image pixel is @xmath18 .",

    "similarly , radio emission in the se and nw is also bounded on the outside by x - ray filaments , but this time x - rays are bright and the radio emission is faint .",
    "radio contours at low surface brightness ( fig .",

    ", the demons method provides a nonparametric way for measuring these motions globally .",
    "since this computationally - efficient method ( approximately ) minimizes the sum of squared differences between pixel intensities , we need to apply it to the smoothed images , not to raw _ chandra _ images that are badly affected by counting noise .",

    "striking morphological variations at various locations within the remnant can be discerned by eye . these include bending of the innermost rim in the west , and even more complex , strongly nonradial motions in the ne where changes in relative positions of prominent emission knots and filaments can be seen . in the framework of the demons algorithm , which can account for such complex motions ,",
    "the 2011 18 kev smoothed image is considered as the _ reference _ image , while the 2015 18 kev smoothed image is the _ moving _ image . before application of the demons method , particle background with an estimated rate of @xmath30 and @xmath31 cts s@xmath1 per image pixel",

    "point sources and the featureless interior of the remnant have been masked out .",
    "the uniform expansion at 0.58%  yr@xmath1 centered @xmath33 north of the geometrical center was used to set initial displacements between the two epochs , then at each iteration step of the demons method computed displacements were smoothed with a gaussian with fwhm of @xmath34 . after achieving convergence ,",

    "this is significantly more than in the n  ne , where the median for regions _ f  n _ is @xmath45 yr@xmath1 ( 5,300 km s@xmath1 ) , but still less than average for g1.9 + 0.3 . as in the ne , strongly nonradial motions are present . unlike the n  ne where x - rays are generally faint and radio is quite bright , this region is moderately bright both in x - rays and radio .",
    "the motions along the major axis are faster than the overall median of @xmath39 yr@xmath1 . for the brightest x - ray rims in the middle ,",

    "these rather modest ( 12,000  13,000 km s@xmath1 ) radial variations along the major axis are not surprising in view of the rapid radial decrease in expansion rates found by .    for the southern radio rim ,",

    "the southernmost extension toward the east , with only a very faint radio counterpart , must be moving much faster than this as we find @xmath62 yr@xmath1 ( 15,000 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "apparently , the motions are also complex in this relatively faint region of the remnant .",
    "a joint fit to the spatially - integrated 19 kev spectrum of and to the background spectrum gave a best - fit photon index @xmath63 of @xmath64 and an absorbing column density @xmath65 @xmath66 , with an absorbed 17 kev flux @xmath67 of @xmath68 erg @xmath66 s@xmath1 ( errors are 90%  confidence intervals ) . both @xmath63 and @xmath69",

    "the much longer observations from later epochs are then dominated by systematic ( not statistical ) errors , and the errors are likely comparable for all 4 epochs . in this case , the flux residuals quoted above are consistent with a linear flux increase from 2007 to 2015 .",
    "our newly - determined , more accurate rate of @xmath74 yr@xmath1 , with the relatively large error of @xmath78 yr@xmath1 accounting for systematic effects , is also consistent with the larger rate of @xmath70 yr@xmath1 ( @xmath79 yr@xmath1  statistical errors only ) based on the epoch i ",

    ". the resulting synchrotron emission will be brighter in radio than that from surrounding regions with faster shocks , but the spectrum will turn over at lower energies and may not reach to x - rays .",
    "that is , the slower shocks we observe , produced by denser ambient material , can explain the differing radio and x - ray morphologies .",

    ", we have @xmath84 ( age ) @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . in the region of the radio maximum ,",
    "the mean shock speed is about 4,000 km s@xmath1 , or about 0.3 of the value at the bright rims .",
    "the integrated spectrum of g1.9 + 0.3 is well described by a rolloff of @xmath87 hz @xcite , implying a rolloff near the radio peak of about @xmath88 hz or less than 0.4 kev  too low to produce appreciable x - ray synchrotron emission at that location .",
    "the rate of flux increase we find , 1.3% yr@xmath1 , is still in the range of radio increase rates of 1 ",
    "2% yr@xmath1 @xcite , so the important question of the comparison of radio and x - ray rates is still unsettled .",
    "different rates imply time - variation in the maximum electron energies , or something even more unexpected .",
    "further observations of both radio and x - rays will be crucial .",
    "the large range of velocity vectors , in both magnitude and direction , that we find in g1.9 + 0.3 highlights the inadequacy of spherically symmetric models in describing sn events and their aftermath .",
    "the north rim is particularly poorly described by 1-d models .",
    "failure to account for the large variations in velocity casts doubt on such analyses .",
