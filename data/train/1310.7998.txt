    "this paper builds on previous work by robison on what are essentially ice tongues ( shelves with no lateral confinement ) .",
    "we generalise this to fluids with arbitrary shear - thinning coefficient @xmath2 ( our theory should also work for shear - thickening fluids , but we did not perform experiments using such fluids ) .",
    "then , we also attempt to generalise the result for laterally confined ice shelves , found by pegler .",
    "the ice sheet is treated as a classical viscous gravity current , though we need to be careful about when this is a valid assumption .    in this paper",
    ", we start with a first principles theoretical solution to shelves without sidewalls in the case of constant initial thickness . reasons for expecting the initial thickness to be constant are also given .",
    "then , we derive a similarity solution for a laterally confined shelf in a channel of constant width .",
    "the solution is valid in the asymptotic limit , so we also derive roughly where this is .",
    "the sheet is also briefly reviewed , so that we can address the grounding line .",
    "the equilibrium grounding line thickness is found for ice tongues .",
    "for laterally confined ice shelves , we already have the initial thickness and thus the grounding line position without considering the sheet .",
    "we briefly discuss how the sheet may influence the dynamics , noting that it does not in the asymptotic limit .",
    "we describe experiments we conducted to help us develop these theories and to test them . the experiments with @xmath3 concentration xanthan",
    "are described first , for the case of sidewall contact .",
    "then , the effect of lowering the concentration is shown .",
    "data for experiments in which there was no sidewall contact are also shown , and compared with theoretical predictions for the grounding line thickness .",
    "an important point is that there are artefacts of our experimental setup , due to the way the flow is initialised .",
    "we determine the length over which such effects are dissipated .",
    "fortunately , the sheet was longer than this length .    as well as the position of the propagating front",
    ", we also have the velocity field in the shelf and sheet . the methods used to obtain this data and the results",
    "are discussed and compared with theoretical expectations .",
    "the thickness of the shelf as a function of position ( the profile ) is also shown from a photograph , and compared with our model .",
    "using our newly developed understanding , we give a partial explanation of the effect of an ice shelf collapsing on the rate of flow of the associated ice sheet .",
    "this should be treated with some caution at this stage , but can readily explain large increases in the flow rate over short time intervals ( such as occurred with larsen b ) .",
    "our work suggests that such a phenomenon can only occur in ice shelves significantly affected by sidewall contact , something which is easily checked .",
    "our model allows a rough calculation of the magnitude of the effect if a particular ice shelf were to collapse , based on topography and other data .",
    "however , our work does not shed much light on which shelves are likely to actually collapse .",
    "[ ht ]    we consider the flow of an incompressible viscous fluid ( at low reynolds number ) according to the geometry shown in [ primary_situation ] ( with @xmath4 held constant ) and assume that the flow does not spread laterally .",
    "although the width of the flow probably could be determined based on @xmath4 and other parameters , we do not attempt to do this .",
    "instead , we treat the width of the shelf as an independent variable .",
    "the force balance in the @xmath5-direction is that    @xmath6    because there are no lateral or vertical stresses and water pressure has a component in the @xmath5-direction ( because the normal to the shelf does ) .",
    "we neglect lateral flow and assume that @xmath7 so that @xmath8 ( vertical flow negligible ) . because the value of the above integral at the front of the shelf must balance with the integrated hydrostatic pressure of the ocean , we have ( see robison et al ) that    @xmath9    considering the absence of lateral and vertical shear in this system , our model for the viscosity is    @xmath10    writing that    @xmath11    and applying a vertical balance of forces argument ( using also @xmath12 ) we obtain that    @xmath13    integrating this vertically , we get that    @xmath14    the term @xmath15 is called the reduced gravity , and accounts for the fact that only a fraction of the shelf is above the waterline .",
    "thus , gradients in the height above sea level are smaller than gradients in @xmath16 . applying archimedes principle to the shelf",
    ", we get that    @xmath17    continuing with our derivation ,    @xmath18    as this is positive , we note that @xmath19 throughout the shelf .",
    "now , we use this information inside the continuity equation :    @xmath20    we use a lagrangian picture to better visualise the situation .",
    "@xmath21    in the co - moving ( lagrangian ) frame , each fluid element enters the shelf at time @xmath22 . assuming that h@xmath23 is independent of @xmath24 ( i.e. a constant source thickness )",
    ", we must have that @xmath25 only .",
    "this means that @xmath26 .",
    "therefore ,    @xmath27    we now convert the integral required to obtain @xmath28 from one over @xmath5 to one over @xmath29 .",
    "the value of @xmath29 is 0 when @xmath30 . when the fluid element reaches @xmath5 , @xmath31 .",
    "we note that a fluid element injected at the source over a time interval @xmath32 has a total volume @xmath33 . at all later times",
    ", it occupies the same volume .",
    "however , it is also a part of the profile .",
    "this means that it occupies a volume @xmath34 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath35    this means that @xmath28 is a function of ( @xmath36 ) only , as we know that @xmath16 is and @xmath37 is assumed constant . integrating @xmath28 and assuming that the source of the shelf ( a grounding line ) remains static , we see that @xmath5 is also going to be a function of @xmath38 only .",
    "all fluid elements reach a given @xmath5 at the same value of @xmath29 . thus , at that position , @xmath16 is always the same ( after the front has reached this position ) .",
    "we therefore have a steady profile .    under these conditions",
    ", the continuity equation reduces to    @xmath39    differentiating this with respect to @xmath5 and substituting in equation [ a ] , we obtain a first - order differential equation for the profile . solving this subject to the constant initial thickness @xmath40",

    "finally , the position of the front as a function of time is readily determined from the velocity field .",
    "@xmath50\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    alternatively , we could ensure the area enclosed by the profile upstream of the front is correct . as the profile is steady , this entails solving    @xmath51    of course , both approaches agree for all @xmath2 . for the case of @xmath52 ,",
    "our solution reduces to that found by robison et al in 2010 .    in a real system",
    ", the shelf would be fed by a sheet at a grounding line ( the ` source ' ) .",
    "the thickness here completely determines the buttressing exerted on the sheet and also affects the velocity field in the sheet .",
    "there is likely to be a unique thickness at which the forces at the grounding line are in equilibrium .",
    "once this is attained , there is no further tendency for change ( as the buttressing is independent of how far the front has propagated - it is always @xmath53 ) .",
    "we assume that the equilibrium so attained is stable .",
    "the equilibrium grounding line thickness is calculated in section 4.1 , although perturbations are not considered in this work .",
    "the geometry in this situation is the same as that considered before , except that now the half - width of the shelf rather than the full width is @xmath54 .",
    "the major difference is the presence of laterally confining sidewalls , which we assume the shelf is in contact with at all times .",
    "the effect of sidewalls will dominate over the effects of hydrostatic pressure on an ice shelf if the shelf is long enough relative to its width and height . to get an estimate for when this may be the case",
    ", we determine when the shelf starts thickening . in order for this to happen",
    ", the velocity field must be altered , so that instead of @xmath55 , we instead have @xmath56 .",
    "this means that , rather than continuity forcing the shelf to thin with distance , the front is going slower than fluid elements behind it so that the flow essentially ` piles up ' .",
    "we expect this to occur in order to provide a pressure gradient to overcome the viscous drag from sidewalls and keep the shelf flowing .",
    "the key thing is that @xmath57 is not purely hydrostatic pressure .",
    "there is a difference between pressure from xanthan and that from water ( partly due to their different densities ) .",
    "this is balanced with a non - zero value of @xmath58 .",
    "as we have seen , this is ( initially ) positive .",
    "now , if we were to reduce @xmath57 enough that @xmath58 were forced to become negative , then the situation would indeed be different to the no sidewalls scenario . to achieve this ,",
    "a certain amount of drag from sidewalls is required .",
    "note that @xmath59 . for @xmath60 , @xmath61 so @xmath62 .",
    "noting that the surface @xmath63 is free by symmetry , we see that @xmath64 , this also holding for @xmath65 .",
    "thus , @xmath66 .",
    "assuming @xmath16 is not yet altered ( so neither is @xmath58 at the front ) , this means that @xmath58 at the source eventually goes negative and becomes increasingly so .",
    "once this occurs , the front starts decelerating and the shelf will be forced to start thickening .",
    "as before , the initial value of that part of @xmath57 which created a @xmath58 term is @xmath67 ( when integrated vertically ) - see equation 4 .",
    "thus , for the shelf to start thickening , the total force from sidewalls must exceed the lateral integral of the above term ( the total non - hydrostatic force , or pushing force ) .",
    "this way , there will no longer be any pushing force at all . with an even longer shelf and even more drag ,",
    "it will change sign , making @xmath56 .",
    "we assume that this is a good indicator of when sidewalls start to have a significant impact upon the dynamics of the flow .",
    "@xmath68    henceforth , if we raise a negative number to a power , we mean that the absolute value of the number is raised to that power . _",
    "the end result is always positive_. for the viscosity , we have assumed that @xmath69 along the walls , so only lateral variations contribute to the total strain there . as a rough estimate ,",
    "we assume a triangular velocity profile which gives    @xmath70    this is an underestimate because the boundary layer is probably very thin so has more shear .",
    "using also the fact that @xmath71 , we obtain that    @xmath72    we note that @xmath58 is very small in the asymptotic limit , because the shelf will get longer and longer ( while the start of the shelf gets thicker , so @xmath28 there decreases ) . as the force balance equation must always hold , we expect ( treating @xmath57 as purely hydrostatic ) that the above equation linking @xmath42 and some typical ( e.g. maximum ) thickness should hold in the asymptotic limit , when our approximation that @xmath58 is very small becomes accurate .",
    "essentially , we have balanced the hydrostatic pressure discontinuity not with a @xmath58 term but instead with a @xmath73 term .",
    "this suggests that the system may be self - similar at late times .",
    "we have said that @xmath47 is required for sidewalls to dominate the shelf , but assuming that a solution is discovered valid for such situations , when does this solution first become an accurate description of the length of the shelf ?",
    "one probably needs computer simulations to answer this in detail , but here we give a rough idea .",
    "the shelf can not be longer than the solution predicts , because then @xmath74 is even lower so there is insufficient driving force to overcome viscous drag from the sidewalls .",
    "also , even more drag exists than in the solution , because the shelf is even longer .",
    "so the situation can not arise",
    ".    however , the shelf can be shorter than our solution predicts - to compensate for the lower drag , it can simply be thick at the front , reducing the thickness gradient .",
    "so we see that there is no problem with a shelf shorter than the solution predicts , but a major problem with longer shelves - these ca nt exist ( if the force balance is dominated by sidewalls ) . thus , one way to determine @xmath42 may be to find when continuing to apply the no sidewalls ( basically , constant @xmath28 ) solution leads to the front being further ahead than the yet to be derived solution when sidewalls dominate . because this situation is impossible , we can use this to determine the point at which the no sidewalls solution can no longer be applied to the system .",
    "this approach would require determining the initial thickness of the shelf , which is possible under some circumstances ( see section 4.1 ) .",
    "we begin by using the fundamental equation for the balance of forces along the channel .",
    "@xmath75    we assume that @xmath76 over the vast majority of the channel , because the shelf is much longer than it is wide .",
    "this allows us to consider only lateral stresses . also assuming negligible transverse and vertical velocities and no lateral variations in thickness",
    ", we obtain that    @xmath77 = \\rho g'\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial x } \\label{bb}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that only gradients in @xmath16 can affect the velocity field , because the resulting pressure gradients _ alone _ drive the flow . integrating the above equation with respect to @xmath78 and applying the no - slip boundary condition for @xmath79 as well as no lateral stress along the centreline of the channel due to symmetry ( i.e. @xmath80 )",
    ", we obtain the velocity profile :    @xmath81    a flow with a velocity pattern like this we shall call a generalised poiseuille flow . the flux crossing a plane of constant @xmath5 is easily found to be    @xmath82    the continuity equation can now be applied to obtain a single non - linear diffusion equation for the fluid .",
    "@xmath83    for a more complicated geometry , a computer simulation will be required to understand what happens , although future work on simple geometries and on slowly varying @xmath54 could shed some light on the problem . for such work",
    ", the @xmath84 term should be brought inside the last bracket , to allow for the possibility that the width of the channel varies with position . for",
    "now , @xmath54 is constant .",
    "we now apply a scaling argument to the above equation and also to the equation of global mass conservation    @xmath85    this suggests that the following quantity is a dimensionless constant of order 1 :    @xmath86    we look for a solution in terms of the similarity variable    @xmath87    our analysis indicates that this is directly proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "because @xmath89 rises slower than @xmath24 , the fact that the area enclosed by the profile must rise linearly with time implies that the whole profile must also be thickening .",
    "thus , @xmath16 will necessarily have an explicit dependence on @xmath24 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath90 , we obtain that    @xmath91    where @xmath92 ( the dimensionless profile ) is of order 1 near the source and decreases to 0 at the front .",
    "differentials in @xmath5 and @xmath24 can be converted into differentials in @xmath93 , applying the usual chain rule .",
    "such an analysis shows that the powers of all externally imposed parameters are indeed equal on all terms , so that we may obtain a single ordinary differential equation for the profile ( in terms of similarity co - ordinates ) .",
    "@xmath94    the term @xmath95 corresponds to the ( dimensionless ) flux crossing a given position .",
    "this gradually decreases from its initial value .",
    "the reason is that part of it is ` lost along the way ' because it goes into increasing the thickness of the profile .    in the real system ,",
    "the advance of the front is not driven by the requirement to push flux through it ( unlike in ice tongues ) .",
    "it is in fact driven by the velocity of fluid elements at the front ( because @xmath96 ) .",
    "we obtain approximate expressions for @xmath97 that become exact at either end of the profile . near the source ( or the rear ) of the profile , @xmath98    near the front ( at @xmath99 ) , we may obtain a first integral of equation [ c ] to deduce that @xmath100    we have used the fact that the integral of @xmath101 with respect to @xmath93 ( from the front to a point nearby ) is second order in the value of @xmath101 , as the profile is approximately triangular in this region ( a singularity in @xmath102 leads to a singular velocity profile , so @xmath102 must be finite ) . using these results , we may obtain an expression for the total change in @xmath97 over the profile , giving directly the fractional change in velocity along the profile ( because @xmath103 ) - though we need the actual value of @xmath104 to compute this .",
    "we solved the differential equation numerically by shooting backwards from the front , using as boundary conditions @xmath105 at @xmath106 and the above expression for @xmath107 . due to computing errors",
    ", there is a small error in @xmath95 at the source , but none at the front of the profile .",
    "obviously , errors near the source are much preferred , because @xmath108 at the front ( so we can ill afford errors here ) .",
    "although the solution looks reasonable for almost any value of @xmath99 , only one value can actually make the total area enclosed by the profile equal to 1 .",
    "an estimate for the error made by the computer can then be obtained by checking how far off the solution is from satisfying equation [ d ] .",
    "amazingly , the whole profile is very nearly triangular .",
    "however , the slope does steepen by about 3% for @xmath109 . at higher",
    "@xmath2 , this effect is reduced and both sides have length approaching @xmath110 .",
    "the reason is that @xmath95 always goes from 1 to 0 , and as @xmath111 ( except right at the front ) , we must have that    @xmath112    we note briefly that for @xmath113 , the dimensionless profile is the unit square .",
    "[ ht ]    .results of computer simulations for those values of @xmath2 used in our experiments , and nearby values consistent with the error in @xmath2 . also included is the result for @xmath114 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the mean value for the intercept that we obtain is :    @xmath115    this is slightly greater than the theoretical value of -4.45 .",
    "we have already mentioned one possible cause of the discrepancy - errors in the start time .",
    "however , although it is a systematic effect , its magnitude will likely be below the error budget quoted above .",
    "an error in the concentration of xanthan could also be to blame ( a 15% reduction in @xmath116 leads to a 7% increase in @xmath89 ) , as could the low shear rates in the experiments .",
    "lateral thickness variations could also account for a further 2% discrepancy .",
    "temperature could plausibly be a factor as well - the lighting we used was very inefficient and could definitely have heated a dark fluid . combining all of these effects , the ( relatively small ) discrepancy between theory and observations could conceivably be explained .    to test these ideas , the viscosity of the fluid we used , prepared in the same way as for the above experiments",
    "; should be measured directly .",
    "one possibility is to use a very narrow tank ( a hele - shaw cell ) and have no ocean , using the viscous gravity current theory to determine the viscosity parameters . also possible",
    "is to use the technique outlined to get a better estimate for the start time .",
    "repeating the experiments in a much narrower tank would make the start time clearer , because lateral variations in thickness would be sufficiently small that the area enclosed by the shelf in a photograph would be a good indicator of its volume .",
    "we observed that all experiments without a sloped bed converged over a length scale that is about @xmath117 .",
    "this suggests that the length of the flat portion of the shelf is only a tenth of the whole shelf , at the time when further convergence towards our similarity solution is no longer discernible in our data .",
    "it is possible to estimate @xmath42 from a photograph - the gradient transitions from 0 to that for the similarity solution over a length scale which is roughly the same as our theory predicts ( see [ real_profile ] and note that the shelf is 90 cm long ) .",
    "as discussed in section 4.2 , convergence should ( and does ) take longer in experiments with a sloped bed installed ( when considering the length of the shelf only )",
    ".        we attempted to determine directly whether the velocity profile across the channel in sidewall contact experiments was in agreement with our theoretical model . in order to do this , we put in a large number of poppy seeds into the xanthan ( about 0.5% by mass ) . these were almost neutrally buoyant , so vertical motion was negligible during the course of our experiments .",
    "we used a high - sensitivity black and white camera with a resolution of @xmath118 pixels to capture photographs at 15 frames per second .",
    "later , we used digiflow software to analyse these .",
    "piv is a relatively new and difficult technique , so we got a relatively large amount of scatter .",
    "we therefore averaged over a 20 second period near the end of an experiment which lasted about 200 seconds .",
    "the thickness gradient in the shelf goes down as @xmath119 , so we judged that it would hardly change over a 20 second period ( and so velocities should hardly change ) .",
    "we also averaged over a 10 cm region of the shelf just beyond the point of maximum thickness . over this region ,",
    "the change in @xmath102 was minimal ( the shelf was about 8 times longer than this , and the shelf is in any case almost perfectly triangular ) so @xmath28 should hardly vary within it .    the theoretical curve drawn in [ velocity_profile ]",
    "is based on a maximum speed consistent with the piv data . because the fluid is clearly satisfying the no - slip boundary condition , the walls of the tank are clearly visible , 763 pixels apart ( this corresponds to 15 cm ) . for the maximum speed ,",
    "we assume an error of at most 0.5 pixels / second , with a mean value of 12.5 .",
    "thus , the maximum velocity is    @xmath120    the speed of the front at a time concurrent with these observations is found to be    @xmath121    errors are because the front decelerates during the 20s we averaged over .",
    "the theoretical change in @xmath102 between the front and rear of the profile is 2.8% , corresponding to an increase in @xmath28 of 11.1% between the rear and the front .",
    "this corresponds to a difference in @xmath28 of 0.027 cm / s , entirely consistent with our observations .",
    "we conclude that both lateral and longitudinal variations in @xmath28 are accurately predicted by our theory .",
    "we also determined vertical velocity profiles in the sheet , to check whether a viscous gravity current model was accurate .",
    "we did this in an experiment with sidewall contact , to increase the thickness of the sheet and get more accurate measurements .",
    "otherwise , only a very small number of particles fit in vertically , despite us using particles sufficiently small that a camera right next to the sheet could only just resolve them .",
    "we expected the viscous gravity current theory to be accurate only for locations sufficiently far downstream of the weir .",
    "therefore , we were expecting to see a discrepancy between theory and observations sufficiently close to the weir .",
    "we conclude that the viscous gravity current theory is an accurate description of the situation sufficiently far from the weir , but breaks down too close to the weir .",
    "this gives us confidence that we have a reasonable understanding of the sheet , suggesting the grounding line may also have been understood .",
    "we also conducted a series of experiments in which the shelf was not in contact with the sidewalls of the tank , at least for a while .",
    "the apparatus still looked the same , except for the weir .",
    "this now had a groove cut in the central 5 cm , reduced to 3 cm for the last 2 runs .",
    "the groove was just above sea level .",
    "for some of the experiments , we installed the sloped bed in the same way as before ( i.e. totally submerged and at @xmath122 ) .",
    "the front appeared to go at a constant velocity , except at very early times ( when all the flux was not yet entering the shelf ) .",
    "this is consistent with our theory , as the experiments ran for much less time than that required for convergence to a self - similar mode of propagation .",
    "consequently , the front propagated at constant speed .",
    "combined with what appeared to be a constant width to the shelf , we suppose that the grounding line had reached a dynamic equilibrium .    due to severe technical difficulties ,",
    "6 experiments are not shown because the shelf rapidly hit a wall of our tank .",
    "readers attempting to repeat our experiments should note that the inlet and seawater extraction pipes should be ( extremely close to ) vertical and in the middle of the tank and the whole tank ( and any sloped bed inside it ) should be level to the horizontal to within about 3 arc - minutes .",
    "the sloped bed , which needs to rest against the weir , also needs to have been manufactured to the correct working angle ( within a few degrees ) .    in what follows ,",
    "we assume that the constant velocity of the shelf can be used to determine the thickness at the grounding line , given also the width of the shelf .",
    "one minor complication in measuring the width is that we used the bottom view of the shelf ( obviously ) , whereas the length of the shelf came from the side view .",
    "this is because a thin shelf is hard to see from underneath , but it still provides 15 cm of optical depth when viewed side on .",
    "however , the optical paths are different in the two cases , due to an extra reflection .",
    "this means the same physical distance appears as a greater number of pixels in the camera focal plane for the side view .",
    "errors result from lateral variations in thickness , which make @xmath54 hard to determine .",
    "these variations were enhanced by the tendency of the fluid to spread sideways without any lateral confinement .",
    "we used the colour of the shelf in the bottom view to determine which regions were thin .",
    "these regions have been excluded from our measurements of @xmath54 .    also , the grounding line is not at constant thickness laterally ( i.e. it is nt a ` line ' ) .",
    "this led to a systematic difference between theory and measurements .",
    "the reason is that the thick central regions of the sheet at the grounding line , which our theory addresses ( because these regions make up most of the sheet ) , were thicker than the shelf far downstream .",
    "apparently , after the grounding line , the shelf in these regions thins with distance until it becomes roughly the same thickness as the _ thinnest _ parts of the sheet at the grounding line .",
    "thus , the velocity measurements were essentially indicating how thick the thinnest regions of the grounding line were .",
    "this causes the theoretical grounding line thickness ( for the thick central regions ) to exceed the measured thickness ( for the thin regions near the edge ) .",
    "this is an interesting phenomenon , and again a case of lateral structure in the flow outside direct consideration in our model having an influence on the shelf .",
    "as before , the effect is more pronounced with a more viscous fluid ( more concentrated xanthan ) .",
    "our experiments indicated that there was a large amount of lateral spreading in the sheet , mostly very close to the weir ( even though the sloped bed was entirely underwater , which we believe reduces the spreading ) .",
    "however , it appeared that there was no noticeable lateral spreading in the shelf .",
    "in fact , the spreading appeared to have occurred well upstream of the grounding line in all of our experiments .",
    "combined with the constant speed of the front of the shelf , this strongly suggests a constant thickness .",
    "we attempted to determine directly the thickness of the shelf at the grounding line .",
    "the resolution on this was relatively poor , because the thickness is only a few mm in most cases .",
    "thus , it appeared in our photographs as about 20 pixels .",
    "reflections from the ocean and a small amount of parallax made it extremely difficult to perform this sort of measurement ( as a look at the photographs will show ) .",
    "the much lower accuracy prevented us from getting a reliable indication of whether our theory is correct using such measurements .",
    "however , they did indicate that measurements of @xmath123 made in this way are consistent with the results of measuring the downstream shelf velocity and width , which we use for testing our theory instead .",
    "experiments were also conducted without a sloped bed . these indicated negligible lateral spreading , suggesting that ice tongues fed by sheets on steep slopes are unlikely to be much wider than the sheet .",
    "[ b ] [ fig : data ]    we also attempted to understand experiments without a sloped bed .",
    "we believe , based on high - resolution photographs , that the angle of the upper surface of the xanthan behind the weir is always close to @xmath124 .",
    "combined with the no penetration condition , we can obtain a velocity profile analogous to those obtained previously for the sheet . the thickness required to drive flux @xmath4 through the weir is then assumed to equal the downstream shelf thickness .    however , it is almost completely certain that other phenomena are critical to understanding the weir . in particular ,",
    "surface tension has implicitly been included in our model ( in terms of fixing the angle of the free surface ) but not explicitly in the force balance .",
    "this means that we can not expect the predictions based on this theory to be very accurate . on the other hand",
    ", it does give the right order of magnitude .",
    "among other things , future work will need to predict an angle of the upper surface close to observed values .    for experiments with a sloped bed ,",
    "we find good agreement with 0.5% xanthan . at 1% , although there is only one experiment , it is again highly probable that lateral variations in thickness are more pronounced .",
    "as these are outside our model , they will lead to a reduction in the accuracy of our predictions .",
    "the prediction that @xmath15 does not significantly affect the grounding line thickness appears to be borne out by a comparison of experiments bl4 and bl5 , the last of which nearly doubled @xmath15 relative to the others .",
    "however , both theory and experiments show a slight reduction in grounding line thickness as a result of making the xanthan nearly twice as buoyant .",
    "another thing we note is that the shelf buckled in one of our experiments .",
    "this led to the front alternately hitting one wall and then the other .",
    "the reason for this is unclear , but it appears to be due to internal elasticity of the xanthan .",
    "we expect that this is unlikely to occur in ice .",
    "the buckling had a small effect on the speed of the front , but much smaller than the error in @xmath54 , so we do not discuss it further .    we now show that the effect of non - hydrostatic forces from the weir was dissipated against basal friction before the location of the grounding line .",
    "xanthan is assumed to overflow the weir by an amount h. we assume that forces here are only hydrostatic , but that this gets converted to a non - hydrostatic force on the sheet due to the highly artificial geometry in the situation .",
    "genuine non - hydrostatic forces at the weir may be calculated on the basis of @xmath125 always being approximately @xmath124 .",
    "such forces appear to be negligible in all of our experiments , compared with hydrostatic forces .",
    "the vertically integrated hydrostatic pressure is @xmath126 .",
    "the basal friction per unit length is @xmath127 .",
    "we assume that    @xmath128    this is an underestimate because the upper surface of the sheet is free so the base must have more than average shear",
    ". however , this will not affect the final result much if @xmath2 is large .",
    "we obtain that the non - hydrostatic force exerted by the supply mechanism will be dissipated over a length scale l , where @xmath129    for @xmath16 around 5 mm at the weir ( as suggested by photographs ) in a 0.5% experiment , we get that @xmath130 cm .",
    "this corresponds to a grounding line that needs to be at least 4.5 mm thick ( including an allowance for the sea level being 1 mm higher than the top of the slope ) .",
    "we obtain similar conclusions for experiments at 1% , allowing the thickness at the weir to rise to as much as 9 mm to account for the greater viscosity",
    ". however , the greater viscosity of the fluid also makes it easier for basal friction to dissipate the force exerted at the weir .",
    "thus , noting that @xmath42 has been overestimated , we conclude that our grounding lines can not have been significantly affected by the force exerted at the weir .",
    "therefore , a simple viscous gravity current model for the sheet should suffice for determining @xmath131 .",
    "we also believe it unlikely that realistic natural situations will allow for such unusual configurations as we had in our experiments , especially anything resembling our weir .",
    "therefore , ice sheets can likely be understood solely in terms of hydrostatic pressure gradients balancing basal friction . however ,",
    "this should be confirmed based on real viscosity parameters and topography .    a final note concerns the unusual corrugated pattern of the edge of the flow in our experiments .",
    "this is known to occur in nature .",
    "our understanding is as follows : variations in flux , due to the oscillatory action of our peristaltic pump , lead to variations in the thickness of the shelf at the grounding line , presumably because a higher flux causes the sheet to spread laterally by an increased amount . because the rest of the shelf essentially moves as a rigid body , the pattern remains permanently imprinted upon the shelf .",
    "this may also explain why the front of the shelf tapers - because it crossed the weir when the flux overflowing it was still rising towards @xmath4 .    in natural situations , the effect can be due to seasonal or other changes in the flux entering the ice shelf .",
    "we note that the effect did not arise in those experiments in which we did not install a sloped bed .",
    "thus , the effect is likely reduced if the terrain is steeper close to the grounding line .",
    "this affects the area in contact with the ocean , which may have important consequences .",
    "real ice shelves do not grow forever .",
    "this is because ice is lost from them .",
    "there are two major ways in which this occurs : iceberg formation and basal melting .",
    "we will neglect sublimation at the top compared to these processes .",
    "melting on the underside of an ice shelf is an important process .",
    "we assume that it proceeds at a rate proportional to the surface area in contact with the ocean .",
    "stability of this surface is assumed .",
    "as the ice shelf is nearly flat , we assume the area remains the same if projected vertically ( @xmath132 ) .",
    "calving of icebergs at the front of an ice shelf is still poorly understood .",
    "we treat it in a similar way to melting on its underside .",
    "thus , the rate at which volume is lost is also proportional to the surface area of the front of the ice shelf",
    ".    the exact mechanism by which this occurs will turn out to be important , in particular whether it is likely to rise by a similar amount to the rate of melting on the underside . for",
    "the moment , we assume that ocean water in contact with the front of an ice shelf slowly melts it . this may happen most efficiently near the surface . as the ice is melted away",
    ", a large overhang will be left .",
    "this will eventually collapse .",
    "if the melting primarily occurs in a narrow layer near sea level , then there will also be an ",
    "underhang. due to buoyancy forces , this will eventually break off as well .",
    "the most widely believed alternative to this mechanism is the action of waves at the front of an ice shelf .",
    "however , it seems likely that this mechanism will also lead to loss of volume being directly proportional to surface area .",
    "our basic model therefore has two parameters . using @xmath133 to denote the volume rate of loss of ice from the shelf ( and @xmath134 for area ) , we define    @xmath135      ice tongues are nearly flat due to the absence of substantial drag on any part of the shelf .",
    "although there is theoretically a small amount of thinning between the grounding line and the front of the shelf ( see equation [ ice_tongue_profile ] ) , we will assume here that ice tongues are perfectly flat owing to the very large value of @xmath42 .",
    "the presence of basal melting will not substantially affect this , although it will require @xmath28 to decrease with @xmath5 .",
    "this will lead to some longitudinal stress , but we assume that ice is sufficiently viscous that this does not much affect the force balance .",
    "it is also evident that a region of the shelf which is thinner than regions upstream of it will eventually thicken due to the increased flux entering this region .",
    "thus , the ice shelf should be stable .",
    "the mass balance for an ice shelf will approximately be given by    @xmath136    we will assume that @xmath54 will not change much .",
    "most likely , it is set by topography close to the grounding line .",
    "thus , an increase in @xmath137 or in @xmath138 will lead to a reduction in @xmath139 .",
    "however , assuming that conditions in the interior of the continent have not changed much , @xmath4 will still be the same and so @xmath131 will remain unaltered @xmath140 see equation [ h ] .",
    "this means that a long ice tongue is not in imminent danger of collapse : it first needs to shorten .",
    "if such a collapse were to occur anyway , the force balance at the grounding line would be unaffected and so there would be no reason for the flux entering the ocean to change .",
    "most likely , the ice tongue would re - establish itself .    under some circumstances , @xmath138 may become sufficiently high that the ice tongue ultimately has its length reduced to 0 . in this case , a small further rise in @xmath138 will cause the grounding line to retreat . the force balance will now be affected .",
    "the resulting reduction in the integrated hydrostatic pressure of seawater will require a reduction in the pushing force ( equation [ g ] ) .",
    "this means the flux entering the ocean must be reduced .",
    "however , with a continual supply of ice , it is not possible for the flux entering the ocean to actually be reduced .",
    "the ice sheet will attempt to steepen to keep the flux entering the ocean equal to that carried away by icebergs .",
    "this will require the upper surface to steepen , achieved by loss of ice near the grounding line .",
    "such a loss is in any case required to maintain the flotation condition , which we believe will still hold at the grounding line .    according to equation [ h",
    "] , however , it is not possible for there to be an equilibrium solution at such a reduced grounding line thickness .",
    "the basic reason is that , for forces to balance , the upper surface of the sheet must be roughly parallel to the sloped bed .",
    "the extra surface gradient now present will not be sustainable in our model .",
    "we suppose that ice is also lost further upstream than the grounding line , thereby maintaining the gradient of the upper surface .",
    "this reduces the flux entering the ocean ( see equation [ q ] ) .",
    "it also reduces the amount of ice lost to iceberg formation .",
    "however , it is clear that the latter effect is much smaller than the former .",
    "consequently , the grounding line will be forced to retreat even further .    without doing detailed calculations",
    "( which may well give a different outcome ) , we speculate that the equilibrium solution is for the grounding line to be above sea level .",
    "then , it is possible for the ice sheet to have zero thickness at the grounding line ( buoyancy forces prevent this occurring for a grounding line below sea level ) .",
    "this will mean the pushing force at the front is zero , but some flux enters the ocean if the front is very steep ( as will likely occur ) .",
    "an estimate of the timescale for reaching this equilibrium may be obtained by setting @xmath141 .",
    "eventually , of course , the flux entering the ocean and that supplied to the sheet will be equal .",
    "[ h ]      a laterally confined ice shelf requires a gradient in its thickness in order to flow . for the moment",
    ", we neglect the formation of icebergs and assume that sidewalls dominate the force balance .",
    "setting @xmath30 at the front of the ice shelf and using @xmath142 ( assuming zero thickness at the front ) , we see that @xmath143 . separating the variables ,",
    "this implies that the shelf will be perfectly triangular",
    ". a quick look at any of our experiments suggests this to be perfectly reasonable , although none of them involved loss of fluid in this way .",
    "the entry flux fully determines the length of the shelf .",
    "@xmath144    combining this result with equation [ shelf_flux ] , we see that    @xmath145    as with ice tongues , an increase in @xmath137 will force a reduction in @xmath139 .",
    "this time , however , @xmath40 will also decrease .",
    "this will lead to grounding line retreat . to maintain the same entry flux ,",
    "@xmath102 will be forced to increase .",
    "the solution we have found is self - consistent as no icebergs will form at the front .",
    "we now check whether this solution is stable .",
    "suppose that a small region of shelf near the front broke off .",
    "we keep the origin of our co - ordinate system where the front previously was .",
    "the condition for stability is that more flux crosses the front than can be carried away by icebergs , thereby leading to a longer shelf and restoration of the lost region .",
    "this means that    @xmath146    if melting of ice is primarily responsible for the formation of icebergs at the front , then it is reasonable to have @xmath147 .",
    "if other mechanisms are responsible , then @xmath138 will perhaps rise slowly or not at all despite large rises in @xmath137 .",
    "the distinction will turn out to be critical .",
    "if @xmath148 , then increases in these parameters will force an increase in @xmath102 and make equation [ shelf_stability ] harder to satisfy .",
    "the shelf will eventually become unstable . unlike in the case of ice tongues , a large laterally confined ice shelf can suddenly become unstable and rapidly disintegrate .",
    "this will cause a drastic alteration in the force balance at the grounding line .",
    "the buttressing effect of the sidewalls upon the system is now gone .",
    "consequently , the system will behave more like an ice tongue .",
    "this would most likely mean the new equilibrium thickness will be given by equation [ h ] .",
    "we suppose that , before the sheet has quite reached equilibrium , it will attempt to balance the forces across the grounding line . this will be achieved by having the ice run parallel to the bed very close to this point .",
    "this allows for a rough estimate of the flux entering the ocean , using equation [ q ] and setting @xmath149 .",
    "one can of course calculate more precisely what flux is required for a particular value of @xmath16 to be the equilibrium grounding line thickness . as this flux",
    "will undoubtedly greatly exceed the flux supplied into the ice sheet , the grounding line will retreat .",
    "our equations can thus be used to get a rough estimate of how long it will take to reach the new equilibrium configuration .",
    "the grounding line will most likely feed an ice tongue .",
    "we believe it unlikely that the rate of iceberg formation will be sufficiently high to prevent this occurring .",
    "also , it appears unlikely that sidewall contact will be properly re - established .",
    "however , if @xmath138 was high enough , an ice tongue would not form at all .",
    "the equilibrium configuration would then not be as just discussed .",
    "most likely , the grounding line would retreat all the way to sea level , with the retreat rate governed by the efficiency of iceberg formation ( @xmath141 ) .",
    "recent breakthroughs in understanding the force balance in a simplified laboratory model of a marine ice sheet have now been significantly extended .",
    "the theory we developed is valid for the case of a shear - thinning power law fluid , with arbitrary @xmath2 ( not just for a newtonian fluid , with @xmath150 ) .",
    "laboratory experiments confirm that our theory is valid to within the ( very tight ) experimental tolerances we achieved .",
    "the experiments themselves revealed additional aspects of the lab model that are still not fully understood , such as buckling and lateral thickness variations .",
    "however , we believe it unlikely that buckling could happen in natural ice shelves , although lateral thickness variations may play an important role .    our theory for ice tongues is based on a straightforward generalisation of robison ( 2010 ) .",
    "the equilibrium grounding line thickness is found in a similar way , but the additional complexity means there is no true analytic solution .",
    "we do , however , find an approximate analytic solution .",
    "the basis for our approximation scheme is that the upper surface of the sheet should be parallel to the lower surface ( the bed ) .",
    "this is not always true , so we derive conditions for it to be a reasonable approximation ( for ice in water , the bed should have a slope of about @xmath151 ) .    for shelves that are laterally confined ,",
    "our theory is based on the assumption that the fluid undergoes generalised poiseuille flow .",
    "this is true for sufficiently long shelves ( assuming they do not lose contact with the sidewalls ) .",
    "we obtain constraints on what length is required , with observations indicating good agreement with our predictions and especially the correct dependence on parameters like the entry flux .",
    "experiments confirm that the presence of a grounding line does not affect the asymptotic behaviour of laterally confined shelves .",
    "therefore , our prediction for the shelf thickness at its start is equivalent to a prediction of the grounding line position . in this case ,",
    "an important feature of our solution is that the grounding line advances for ever , although it decelerates .",
    "we combined our understanding of the forces with a basic model for loss of ice from a shelf due to melting on its underside and iceberg formation .",
    "this prevents the shelf growing for ever - an equilibrium configuration is attained .",
    "however , there was an instability peculiar to laterally confined ice shelves , which can suddenly collapse if oceanic conditions change in a particular way .",
    "ice tongues seem more stable , but if conditions alter substantially and prevent it existing at all , then the sheet becomes unstable .",
    "this may lead to retreat of the grounding line to sea level , although this process may take a long time .",
    "the buttressing exerted by the shelf upon the sheet , which supposedly causes significant acceleration of the sheet if it is removed ; actually comes from sidewall contact .",
    "if there is no sidewall contact , then the buttressing is equivalent to what would be provided by hydrostatic pressure of water alone , which means this will still be present with no shelf .",
    "only the additional amount due to the shelf being in contact with sidewalls can be removed by melting the shelf , so in ice tongues we do not expect a sudden acceleration if the shelf were to break up . in this case , a reduction in viscosity ( due to global warming ) may still cause a significant acceleration of the flow ( because it is very sensitive to @xmath116 ) . however , this is not due to collapse of the ice shelf .",
    "our model requires assumptions about poorly understood processes like iceberg formation .",
    "detailed understanding of these processes will be essential at some point , if we are to fully understand events like the collapse of the larsen b ice shelf ( nearly ten years ago ) .",
    "hopefully , these events can be understood in time to prepare for their consequences , something this work may help with ."
