    "the next generation of wide - area extragalactic submillimetre and millimetre ( hereafter sub - mm ) surveys , for example from the balloon - borne large aperture submillimetre telescope ( blast , devlin et al 2001 ) , laboca on the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) , the scuba2 camera on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) and bolocam - ii on the large millimetre telescope ( lmt ) , will produce large samples ( @xmath2 ) of distant , luminous starburst galaxies .",
    "the dramatic increase in the number of submillimetre detected galaxies requiring follow - up observations makes it unreasonable to expect that a large fraction of their obscured or faint optical and ir counterparts will have unambiguous , spectroscopically - determined redshifts .",
    "an alternative method to efficiently and robustly measure the redshift distribution for large samples of submillimetre galaxies is clearly necessary .    given the underlying assumption that we are witnessing high rates of star formation in these submillimetre galaxies , then we expect them to have the characteristic fir peak and steep submillimetre ( rayleigh - jeans ) spectrum which is dominated by thermal emission from dust heated to temperatures in the range @xmath3k by obscured young , massive stars .",
    "the observed radio  fir luminosity correlation in local starburst galaxies ( e.g. helou et al .",
    "1985 ) , that links the radio synchrotron emission from supernova remnants with the later stages of massive star formation , is also expected to apply to the submillimetre galaxies .",
    "thus , in recent years , a considerable amount of effort has been invested in assessing the accuracy with which these broad continuum features in the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of submillimetre galaxies at rest - frame mid - ir to radio wavelengths can be used to provide photometric - redshifts ( hughes et al .",

    "subsequently it was highlighted by ivison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) to be very likely erroneous on account of its lack of a radio counterpart ( despite its very bright apparent sub - mm flux ) .",
    "the spurious nature of this source has been supported by the failure to detect the source in a reanalysis of the 8-mjy maps conducted as part of shades ( mortier et al .",
    "2004 ; www.roe.ac.uk/@xmath14ifa/shades ) , and by its non - detection in the iram mambo mm - wavelength maps of the 8-mjy lockman east field ( greve et al .",

    "this object , however , is a known agn , with strong , flat - spectrum , variable radio emission .",
    "therefore , it must be excluded from the analysis presented here , which relies on the fitting of non - variable starburst - dominated spectral templates .",
    "as we show in fig  3 , no sed in our local template library can reproduce the high radio fluxes of this variable radio - source at the spectroscopic redshift , and indeed , in paper ii we already reported that the sed could not be matched at any redshift with the local templates .",

    "* smm131212.7 + 424423 ( @xmath18 ) still do not have published 1.4ghz data from the ssa13 field ( fomalont et al .",
    ", in prep ) , and we therefore can not reconstruct the radio  sub - mm sed of this source .    in the analysis described in  2.2",
    "we include the remaining 5 sub - mm sources from the 8-mjy survey studied by chapman et al .",
    "( 2003a ) , namely n2850.1 , n2850.4 , n2850.8 , le850.6 and le850.18 , which have unambiguous radio identifications from ivison et al .",
    "the spectroscopic redshifts for all these sources also appear to be secure , and indeed redshift information for two of them has been published elsewhere : n2850.4 ( smail et al . 2003 ) and n2850.1 ( chapman et al .",
    "2002a )    from deep near - infrared spectroscopy with the subaru telescope , simpson et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have measured spectroscopic redshifts based on two or more emission lines with secure radio and near - infrared identifications for 2 additional 8-mjy scuba sources ( n2850.2 and n2850.12 in the elais n2 field , scott et al .",
    "we therefore include these two sources in the expanded sample analysed here .",
    "we note that simpson et al . also suggested a tentative redshift for le850.3 estimated from a single 2.5@xmath13 emission - line , and also a redshift for cudss14.9 from the putative hk ca absorption lines that need confirmation ( simpson , priv .",
    "communication ) .",
    "these latter two redshifts are not considered robust enough for inclusion in our analysis .",
    "we thus have 7 new redshifts for robust sub - mm sources from the uk 8-mjy scuba survey , which can be added to the heterogenous collection of 8 sub - mm sources with spectroscopic redshifts previously considered by aretxaga et al .",
    "thus , the new spectroscopic data have effectively doubled the size of the comparison sample , as well as extending the redshift baseline out to @xmath19 .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]      +    since our original analysis in paper  ii , new photometric data at 1.2 mm obtained with mambo ( greve et al .",
    "2004 ) have also become available for the sub - mm galaxies first identified in the uk 8-mjy scuba survey areas ( scott et al .",
    "we have therefore incorporated this additional photometric information in a re - derivation of the photometric redshifts of uk 8-mjy scuba sources in the current spectroscopic sample .",
    "we also include n2850.12 which has a 3.4@xmath13 flux determination at 850@xmath6 m , and hence failed our selection criteria in paper  ii , but which now has a spectroscopic - redshift ( simpson et al .",
    "2004 ) based on an ir counterpart associated with the 3@xmath13 peak in the radio observations of ivison et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "we have adopted the fiducial evolutionary model le2 ( the least restrictive one in paper  ii , which applied a non - informative prior at @xmath20 , and @xmath21 luminosity evolution to @xmath22 ) to derive the new photometric - redshift estimates which are given in table  1 .",
    "we produce simulated catalogs of sources in mock surveys to the same depth as those in which the real sub - mm galaxies were detected .",
    "the corresponding redshift distributions are then derived by the joint probability of identifying the particular radio  mm  fir colours and fluxes of the real sources with the mock galaxies in the simulated catalogs . in order to check the stability of the redshift solutions found ,",
    "we have calculated 100 different monte carlos for each source , and for each of these realizations we have derived its redshift probability distribution , its mode and 68% and 90% confidence level intervals . as expected , the sources with photometric redshifts based on 2 or more colours are the most stable and show well defined peaks and little variation in the mode of the redshift distribution of the different simulations .",
    "it is important to note that these photometric redshift estimates include absolute calibration errors of 5 - 20% in the individual radio  submillimetre fluxes , and assume no correlation between the luminosity and shape of an sed ( or temperature ) .    from our sample of 15 sub - mm galaxies , fig .",
    "1 shows the photometric - redshift spectroscopic - redshift regression plot for those 12 sources that have at least one robust colour based on two or more detections ( @xmath23 ) in the radio - mm - fir regime .",
    "the remaining 3 sources ( n2850.8 , n2850.12 , and w - mm11 ) have a robust detection at only one wavelength and various upper - limits and hence are not included in fig .",
    "1 .    figs .",
    "2 and 3 show the comparison of the observed seds of the sources analysed in this paper and the template seds considered in the photometric redshift analysis , illustrating the cases where there is good agreement and catastrophic disagreement , respectively .",
    "all seds in our template library are accepted by more than one of these sources .      among the photometric redshifts based on at least two colours ( with well measured fluxes , i.e. @xmath23 , in three or more bands )",
    "the submillimetre galaxy which departs most clearly from the @xmath24 line is n2850.1 ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our new photometric redshift of n2850.1 , using the most recent upper limit at 1.2 mm ( greve et al .",
    "2004 ) together with the 450 , 850@xmath6 m and 1.4ghz fluxes , is @xmath26 at a 68% confidence level , and @xmath27 at a 90% level .",
    "these values are consistent with the estimates presented in paper  ii , but remain strongly inconsistent with the optical spectroscopic redshift ( @xmath28 ) reported by ( chapman et al .",
    "this is not surprising as there has already been considerable debate over whether the optical identification for this sub - mm source is correct . the optical spectrum and redshift for this counterpart , originally published by chapman et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , led these authors to argue that the optically - bright galaxy coincident ( within @xmath29 ) with the radio position of n2850.1 was possibly a foreground galaxy that lenses the sub - mm source .",
    "this argument was based primarily on the fact that the temperature of the dust emission @xmath30  k deduced for the sub - mm source at the optical spectroscopic redshift was 4@xmath13 below that of the local dusty galaxies with the same intrinsic luminosity . in chapman",
    "( 2003a ) , n2850.1 has a revised temperature of @xmath31  k or 6@xmath13 below the temperature distribution of local analogs , and colder than smm22173 + 0014 , which chapman et al .",
    "( 2002a ) also claim is lensed .",
    "it is clear therefore that among the sources considered here , n2850.1 is the most likely example of a bright sub - mm source produced by gravitational lensing by an intermediate redshift galaxy , analogous to the case of hdf850.1 studied in detail by dunlop et al .",
    "proving this beyond doubt remains a challenge , as astrometric information of the quality available to dunlop et al .",
    "( 2004 ) does not yet exist in the case of n2850.1 .",
    "whatever the correct explanation for its properties , it is obvious that n2850.1 is an unusual source , being the only object in the sample of 15 galaxies which can not be fit by any of our sed templates when redshifted to @xmath32 ( see fig .  3 ) . for the sake of transparency and completeness in what follows we therefore quote the overall accuracy of the redshift estimation procedure both with and without the inclusion of n2850.1 in the statistical calculations .      in general the agreement between photometric and spectroscopic redshifts is encouraging .",
    "the three sources for which photometric - redshifts are based on a solid detection ( @xmath23 ) at just one wavelength , however , are the least precise due to insufficient photometric constraints , although we note that they are still formally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts found : n2850.8 at @xmath33 has a photometric redshift @xmath34 at a 68% confidence level ( 1.04.5 at the 90% level ) ; n2850.12 has a photometric redshift of @xmath35 at a 68% confidence level ( 1.5 to 5.0 at the 90% level ) , which is consistent with the @xmath36 ( simpson et al .",
    "2004 ) ; and w - mm11 at @xmath37 , as determined in paper  ii , has a @xmath38 at a 68% confidence level ( 2.05.8 at the 90% level ) .    despite the strong suspicion that n2850.1 is a lensed scuba galaxy at a redshift @xmath39 , even if we include n2850.1 in our analysis the rms dispersion about @xmath40 is @xmath41 .",
    "this result considers only those 10/15 sub - mm galaxies with at least two measured colours based on 3 or more @xmath23 detections in the radio  mm  fir regime .",
    "the precision significantly improves to @xmath42 if we exclude n2850.1 .",
    "extending this analysis to the 12/15 sources with at least one colour determined from detections at two or more bands , the measured mean accuracy of the photometric redshifts in the range @xmath43 is @xmath44 and @xmath45 , including and excluding n2850.1 , respectively . finally if we also include sources with only upper - limits in the colours ( for example a single submillimetre detection with a non - detection at radio wavelengths ) , we measure @xmath46 and @xmath47 , including and excluding n2850.1 , respectively .",
    "blain et al . ( 2003 ) have stated that the technique described in papers i and ii assumes a narrow - range of local sed templates , with a tight distribution of dust temperatures , and luminosities , to derive the photometric redshifts .",
    "we emphasise again that the range of dust temperatures in our template library ranges from 25  65k , and that we include 20 local galaxies ( starbursts and agn ) with well - measured seds and fir luminosities spanning the range @xmath48 .",
    "furthermore , it is misleading to suggest that a wide range of dust temperatures ( that may be correlated with luminosity ) should translate directly into a similar redshift uncertainty in our calculations , since the redshift distributions are dominated by those seds that best fit the radio  mm  fir data .",
    "although all seds contribute to the redshift distributions at some level , but with varying degrees of significance , a well - defined peak can be measured .",
    "the comparison presented here provides reassurance that , by allowing the variety of local template seds to be selected at random , and then scaled to the required fir luminosity to populate the evolving luminosity function , we have offered the photometric - redshift method a library of galaxies with a sufficiently broad range of dust - temperatures , sed shapes and levels of star formation and agn activity from which to find a solution .",
    "we also note that the sensitivities of the current submillimetre experiments in blank - field surveys select only those starburst galaxies with @xmath49 .",
    "this being the case , then perhaps the future choice of seds should be restricted to those galaxies more luminous than this sensitivity limit , in which case our library of seds will only be lacking the highest - luminosity local counterparts ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "if we consider that there exists a luminosity  temperature dependence in the seds of starbursts , then we will be missing the seds that peak at the shortest wavelengths in our library , and thus we will be underestimating the redshifts for some fraction of scuba sources .",
    "an encouraging aspect of our study is that the derived errors in our calculations of the individual photometric redshifts ( i.e. the 68% confidence levels , shown as dotted lines in fig .  1 and in column  3 of table  1 ) , are systematically larger than the measured dispersion around the @xmath40 line .",
    "this dispersion is based on the differences between the modes of the photometric redshift distributions and the spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "for instance , the average 68% confidence interval is @xmath51 for those sources with two or more colours derived from three or more detections ( black diamonds in fig .  1 ) , while the measured accuracy of their photometric redshifts is @xmath52 and @xmath53 , including and excluding n2850.1 .",
    "this suggests that our errors are overestimated , possibly due to considering a range of sed templates wider than the true , but still unknown , distribution of sed shapes of sub - mm galaxies .",
    "we note , however , that , with the currently available photometry , all the seds in our template library are accepted by more than one sub - mm galaxy as possible counterparts ( fig .  2 ) .    to conclude this paper , and to provide further justification for the results presented in  2.2 , we illustrate in fig.[evol_photz ] how the accuracy of the photometric - redshift method evolves and improves as we include an increasing number of robust photometric measurements",
    "when based on a single detection at 850@xmath6 m ( fig.4a ) the initial photometric - redshift estimates reflect only the prior assumption for the luminosity evolution of the sub - mm population .",
    "the addition of detections or deep limits at @xmath54 m , that sample the rest - frame fir  sub - mm peak , place initial constraints on the photometric redshifts ( fig.4b ) .",
    "the 850@xmath6m  radio spectral index has been shown to also provide a useful one - colour measure of photometric - redshifts for the sub - mm population ( e.g. carilli & yun 2000 ) , with the ability to robustly identify galaxies at @xmath55 from those at lower - redshifts . hence the use of data in the radio regime ( 1.48 ghz ) in this analysis continues to improve the photometric - redshift accuracy ( fig.4c ) by providing confirmation , and therefore adding more weight to the results determined from the data at @xmath56 m .",
    "finally , with the addition of further mm - wavelength data at 12 mm , we eventually derive a photometric - redshift accuracy of @xmath57 or @xmath58 for all 12 galaxies with at least one well - measured colour if we include or reject n2850.1 .",
    "respectively ( fig.4d ) .",
    "= 8.0 cm     +    = 8.0 cm     +    = 8.0 cm     +    = 8.0 cm     +",
    "we have complemented our previous comparison of photometric - redshifts and spectroscopic redshifts for 8 submillimetre galaxies ( aretxaga et al .",
    "2003 ) with 7 new spectroscopic redshifts ( chapman et al .",
    "2003a , simpson et al . 2004 ) and recently published mambo 1.2 mm data ( greve et al .",
    "the increased number of available spectroscopic redshifts for submillimetre galaxies with sufficient accompanying rest - frame radio to fir photometry confirms the reliability of our previous simulations and predictions for the redshifts of sub - mm sources .",
    "this accuracy is all the more impressive given that the photometric - redshifts for 6 of new sources were effectively predicted before the additional 7 spectroscopic redshifts were available ( paper ii ) .",
    "if we consider all available data for those sub - mm galaxies that have at least one colour determination based on two detections , we conclude that the rest - frame radio - fir photometric method can provide redshifts with an accuracy of @xmath59 over the redshift interval @xmath60 .",
    "this redshift uncertainty increases to @xmath57 if the true spectroscopic - redshift of the brightest sub - mm source n2850.1 in the northern elais2 field is @xmath61 ( chapman et al .",
    "there is , however , a more natural explanation for the discrepancy between the photometric - redshift and spectroscopic - redshift of n2850.1 , namely that the sub - mm source is lensed by the foreground optical counterpart ( as already suggested by chapman et al .",
    "2002a ) , analogous to the situation for hdf850.1 , the brightest object in the hubble deep field ( dunlop et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the photometric method currently relies on limited data , restricted to a few low s / n detections at observed radio , millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths .",
    "no optimization of the current method has been made , based on any prior knowledge of those local sed templates that are consistent with the rest - frame data . despite the lack of any assumption in our simulations and analysis about a dependence between the shape of a local sed and luminosity of the redshifted submillimetre source , the method clearly works to a useful accuracy ( e.g. van kampen et al . 2004 ) .",
    "the inclusion of such a dependence and measurements with greater s / n can only reduce the dispersion of possible seds that are consistent with the observational data , and hence this will reduce the width of the redshift probability distributions for individual targets .",
    "one of the difficulties in this analysis has been to select from the limited publically - available information which sub - mm galaxies have secure spectroscopic redshifts derived from unambiguous optical or ir counterparts .",
    "it is therefore encouraging to look forward to the next few years as the essential radio , ( sub)millimetre and fir photometric data become available from facilities such as the vla , gbt , lmt , apex , blast , herschel , spitzer and astro - f for complete and substantial samples of sub - mm sources .",
    "thus we are confident that the combination of these high s / n multi - wavelength rest - frame radio  fir data will generate photometric - redshifts with accuracies of @xmath62 for the majority of the individual sub - mm selected galaxies . given this , it will be possible to accurately measure the entire redshift distribution and star formation history of the high-@xmath63 population of heavily - obscured starburst galaxies without having to measure a spectroscopic redshift for every sub - mm source .",
