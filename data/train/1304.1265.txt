    "the low - energy quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) manifesting nonperturbative natures have been investigated extensively in many different ways , such as the lattice qcd ( lqcd ) , effective qcd - like models , qcd sum rule ( qcdsr ) , and so on . to understand the nonperturbative features of qcd , it is necessary to scrutinize the qcd vacuum structure , which governs the breakdown of relevant symmetries of qcd and the phase transitions of the qcd matter .",
    "note that , recently , the electromagnetic ( em ) properties of the qcd vacuum at finite temperature ( @xmath1 ) and/or finite quark chemical potential ( @xmath8 ) have attracted much attention from experiments  @xcite as well as theories  @xcite , being together with the energetic progresses of the heavy - ion collision experiments . among the relevant physical quantities , which are sensitive to the u(1 ) em interactions , the qcd magnetic susceptibility is one of the important ones , due to its impact in theories and experiments . the qcd magnetic susceptibility for a quark flavor @xmath9 , @xmath0 is stands for a response of the scalar ( chiral ) condensate to the external em background field , and defined in terms of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for the tensor - polarization operator ( tp - vev ) , @xmath10 , in euclidean space  @xcite : @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 denote the quark electric charge and the em field strength tensor .",
    "the subscript em in the left - hand - side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : vev ] ) stands for the existence of the external em field .",
    "note that tp - vev is a linear function of @xmath13 in the leading order .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is also pertinent to the photon distribution amplitude  @xcite as well as the anisotropy in terms of the para- or dia - magnetism  @xcite .",
    "this physical quantity was studied up to now in qcdsr  @xcite , effective quark models  @xcite , holographic qcd ( hqcd )  @xcite , operator product expansion with the pion dominance ( ope@xmath14pd )  @xcite , and lqcd  @xcite , and so on .",
    "note that , in the previous work , we computed @xmath0 using the liquid instanton model ( lim )  @xcite at finite density  @xcite , in which we noticed that @xmath15 with the euclidean metric , indicating the diamagnetic matter ( @xmath16 for the minkowski metric ) . taking the present heavy - ion collision experiments at low quark density into account , in the present work , we are focusing on the qcd magnetic susceptibility for the flavor su(2 ) , su(@xmath17 ) , at finite @xmath1 and @xmath18 , using lim , modified by the @xmath1-dependent caloron solution  @xcite .",
    "we mention that all the calculations are performed in euclidean space .",
    "the relevant instanton parameters , such as the average ( anti)instanton size @xmath19 and inter-(anti)instanton distance @xmath20 are modified as functions of temperature , employing the trivial - holonomy ( harrington - shepard ) caloron solution  @xcite . as a result , these modifications show the partial restorations of the spontaneous breakdown of the chiral symmetry ( sb@xmath21s ) as @xmath1 increases . relating to those model parameters , it is worth mentioning that our model ( renormalization ) scale is taken as @xmath22 gev at @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-dependent effective quark mass is computed numerically as an order parameter for sb@xmath21s , employing the @xmath1-modified effective thermodynamic potential  @xcite . by doing that",
    ", we observe correct universal chiral restoration patterns for the zero and finite current - quark masses , i.e. the second - order and crossover chiral restoration patterns .",
    "being equipped with those ingredients , we present the numerical results for the chiral condensates @xmath23 , tensor condensate @xmath24 , their ratio corresponding to the magnetic susceptibility @xmath25 , and tp - vev @xmath10 . here , we write the definition of the tensor condensate as follows : @xmath26 for instance , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors defined the tensor condensate as @xmath27 .    from the numerical calculations , it turns out that the chiral condensate exhibits the correct chiral restoration patterns as expected from those of the effective quark mass as mentioned above .",
    "the chiral transition @xmath1 is given as @xmath28 mev for the zero and finite current - quark masses , i.e. @xmath29 , and @xmath30 mev , considering the su(@xmath17 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "note that the values for the chiral condensates are obtained as @xmath31 for @xmath32 mev at @xmath5 .",
    "these values are well compatible with its empirical one @xmath33 . using the same parameter sets",
    ", we also compute the tensor condensates , which also manifest the universal chiral restoration patterns . at zero temperature",
    ", we have @xmath34 mev for @xmath32 mev at @xmath5 .",
    "interestingly , we observe bump structures in the tensor condensate curves for @xmath7 at @xmath35 mev , due to the nontrivial interference between the constituent- and current - quark masses .",
    "these values are again well - compatible with the known theoretical estimations  @xcite .",
    "when we compare the temperature - dependent behaviors of the present numerical results with the lattice data  @xcite , extrapolated to the physical @xmath36-quark mass , at the renormalization scale @xmath37 gev , we observe qualitatively good agreement with them , but sizable deviations also appear in the vicinity of the chiral transition temperature @xmath6 . at the chiral phase transition @xmath1 , @xmath38 mev ,",
    "the tensor condensate for @xmath7 becomes @xmath39 mev , whereas it is zero for the chiral limit .",
    "it turns out that the magnetic susceptibility decrease steadily with respect to @xmath1 .",
    "we obtain their typical values , estimated as @xmath40 for @xmath32 mev at @xmath5 .",
    "again , these values are well matched with those from the lqcd and other effective models . beyond @xmath38 mev , the curve for the magnetic susceptibility behave almost as a linearly decreasing one as @xmath1 increases . at @xmath6 , we observe about @xmath3 decreases in their strengths , in comparison to those at @xmath5 .",
    "tp - vev is a linear function of the external magnetic field ( @xmath41 ) in the leading order .",
    "the slope of the tp - vev line with respect to @xmath41 decreases as @xmath1 increases , since the tensor condensate plays the role for its slope value , signaling the ( partial ) restoration of sb@xmath21s .",
    "thus , tp - vev can be considered as a chiral order parameter .",
    "consequently , we observe that it vanishes at @xmath42 mev in the chiral limit , whereas remains finite beyond @xmath6 for @xmath7 , because of the crossover chiral phase transition .",
    "we organize the present work as follows : in section ii , we briefly introduce the liquid instanton model ( lim ) and how to compute the magnetic susceptibility in terms of the field theoretical manner . in section iii",
    ", the temperature modifications of the relevant model parameters are performed using the trivial caloron solution .",
    "we also show the correct universal chiral restoration patterns , computed within the present model .",
    "the numerical results for the chiral and tensor condensates as functions of temperature are presented with relevant discussions in section iv .",

    "<S> we investigate the qcd magnetic susceptibility @xmath0 for flavor su(2 ) at finite temperature ( @xmath1 ) beyond the chiral limit , using the liquid instanton model , defined in euclidean space and modified by the @xmath1-dependent caloron solution . </S>",
    "<S> the background electromagnetic fields are induced to the qcd vacuum , employing the schwinger method . </S>",
    "<S> we first compute the scalar ( chiral ) and tensor condensates as functions of @xmath1 as well the current - quark mass @xmath2 , signaling the correct universal chiral restoration patterns . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that @xmath0 , given by the ratio of the two condensates , is a smoothly decreasing function of @xmath1 , showing about @xmath3 reduction of its strength at the chiral transition @xmath4 , in comparison to that at @xmath5 , and decreases almost linearly beyond @xmath6 for @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the present numerical results are in qualitatively good agreement with other theoretical results , including the lattice simulations . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we examine the effects of the external magnetic field on the tensor - polarization vev , resulting in that it plays the role of the chiral order parameter . </S>"
