    "in a recent paper , courteau & rix ( 1998 ; hereafter cr98 ) have used the residuals of the well known relationships of spiral galaxies , luminosity _ vs. _ velocity and luminosity _ vs. _ radius , to estimate the disc - to - halo mass ratio @xmath1 at @xmath2 peaks ( freeman 1970 ) . ] .",
    "hereafter , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the argument of cr98 relies on the idea that , for a given mass , more compact self - gravitating stellar discs have higher rotation speeds than less compact ones ( according to a @xmath5 scaling ) .",
    "this effect should be observed in the rotation curves , if the disc component is dynamically important , and should disappear if the halo is dominant .",
    "more specifically , the effect can be measured by correlating the deviation @xmath6 that an object has with respect to the mean velocity ",
    "luminosity relation , with the deviation @xmath7 that the object has with respect to the mean radius ",
    "luminosity relation . for disc dominated systems",
    ", one should expect @xmath8 , while for halo dominated ones it is likely that @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "in large samples of @xmath11 spirals , cr98 find an ensemble value of @xmath12 , which is interpreted as evidence that , on average , the disc contribution to @xmath13 is far from maximal ( see below ) .",
    "the actual value of @xmath1 is estimated by computing the final halo mass distribution by adiabatically contracting ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 ) a proto - disc inside an initial standard cdm halo ( e.g. , navarro et al .",
    "1996 ) into a final configuration with @xmath14 kpc .",
    "so , cr98 find @xmath15 for galaxies with @xmath16 ; see rhee ( 1996 ) for the @xmath17-magnitudes of the cr98 sample .",
    "we adopt h@xmath18 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 .",
    "no result of this paper depends on this value . ]",
    "( virtually independent of the initial dm distribution or the exact disc scale length or the presence of a [ realistic ] stellar bulge ) .    before discussing this result ,",
    "let us comment on the procedure adopted by cr98 .",
    "three crucial assumptions have been made : _ 1 ) _ the residuals of both relationships are essentially due to differences in the mass structure between each individual galaxy and the `` average '' galaxy ; _ 2 ) _ the residuals are not affected by discrepancies between redshift distancies and true distances , observational errors and selection bias ; _ 3 ) _ the two relationships are intrinsically log - linear and/or do not have hidden parameters . the validity of these assumptions is far from certain .",
    "moreover , the method , devised to determine the average value of @xmath1 in a sample of galaxies , is poorly suited to detect systematic and/or random variations of @xmath1 within the sample itself . while these issues do not affect the main thrust of the cr98 idea , it is likely that they strongly modify the interpretation .    independently of the above issues ( to be considered in a separate paper ) ,",
    "the cr98 claim of @xmath20 in _ high-@xmath21 _ spirals is quite surprising .",
    "( much less so if referred to _ low-@xmath21 _ spirals , e.g. persic & salucci 1990 . )",
    "direct modelling of rotation curves ( rcs ) of high-@xmath21 galaxies , based on the maximum disc hypothesis ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ; sancisi & van albada 1987 ) , is able to successfully fit the rcs out to @xmath22 with @xmath23 ( see : kalnajs 1983 ; van albada et al .",
    "1985 ; kent 1986 ; begeman 1987 ; broeils 1992 ; broeils & courteau 1997 ) .",
    "best - fitting multicomponent mass modelling , applied to extended high resolution rcs , has also found disc - dominated solutions for high-@xmath21 galaxies ( e.g. : broeils 1992 ; see references in section 4 . )",
    "the rc profile methods , that are powerful diagnostics in quantifying the disc - to - total mass discrepancy , consistently find that @xmath24 galaxies as disc dominated , i.e. @xmath23 ( persic & salucci 1988 , 1990 ; salucci & frenk 1989 ; casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; salucci & persic 1997 ) .",
    "finally , the swing amplifier constraints , coupled with stellar population arguments , seem to favour ( near-)maximum discs ( see athanassoula et al .",
    "1987 and bosma 1998 ) .    despite this , cr98 are not alone in their claim of halo - dominated ( hd ) high-@xmath21 spirals .",
    "mass models , built from the properties of the stellar velocity dispersion , find low values of @xmath1 ( bottema 1997 ) ; the swing amplifier constraints may also imply subdominant discs ( fuchs et al .",
    "moreover , the local galactic disc column density of @xmath25 pc@xmath26 , estimated by studying the _ z_-motions of local stars as a function of their height above the galactic plane , is interpreted as evidence of a dominant halo ( e.g. , kuijken & gilmore 1991 and kuijken 1995 ; but see sackett 1997 and dehnen & binney 1997 ) .    on the cosmological side , the universal cdm density profile ( navarro et al .",
    "1996 , 1997 ) features only a small central region where the halo rotation curve @xmath27 increases with radius , while it has @xmath28 for @xmath29 that , combined with @xmath30 observed in @xmath11 galaxies , implies a dominant halo .",
    "the case of hd mass models for high-@xmath21 spirals is in ( indirect ) disagreement with our previous work ( persic & salucci 1990 ; persic , salucci & stel , 1996 [ pss ] ) . however , in view of the strong cr98 claim , it is worthwhile to investigate the issue further by means of specific tests .",
    "notice that , for high-@xmath21 galaxies , whose rcs are well described by @xmath31 , with @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the cr98 mass model represents the whole class of hd models .",
    "in fact , a property of the above rotation curve is that any hd model ( i.e. , with @xmath36 ) will have a halo velocity profile , @xmath37 , very similar to the one adopted by cr98 , independent of @xmath1 and independent also of the precise values of @xmath38 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) in high-@xmath21 objects",
    ". then , a test performed on the cr98 model applies also to any hd mass model of high - luminosity spirals .    in detail , in this paper we will devise two tests that , in the spirit of salucci & frenk ( 1989 ) , single out two clear kinematical properties of rcs , and we will then check whether these are compatible with the cr98 model ; failing that , we will iterate the tests on a disc dominated ( dd ) model .",
    "the plan is the following : in section 2 we determine the synthetic rc of high-@xmath21 spirals ; in sections 3 and 4 we perform two tests concerning the inner and outer rotation curves ; in section 5 we discuss the results obtained and their implications .",
    "in this section we coadd individual spiral rcs into a synthetic curve .",
    "this procedure , pioneered by rubin et al .",
    "( 1985 ) separately for sa , sb and sc galaxies , was extensively used by pss . in particular , for a sample of @xmath391000 optical rcs of mostly late spirals , pss have shown that : ( 1 ) within each given luminosity interval , the scatter of rcs around their mean is comparable with the scatter of data points around a given individual curve ( i.e. , the cosmic scatter is comparable with the error ) ; and ( 2 ) the sequence of galaxy luminosities determines a sequence of rc shapes .",
    "[ a principal component analysis of the same sample ( rhee 1996 ; see also roscoe 1998 ) confirms the above results .",
    "] moreover , at a given luminosity , there is practically no difference between the _ individual _ profiles of ( high quality ) rcs and the corresponding _ coadded _ profile ( pss ) .",
    "this evidence indicates that , as far as _ the gross features of their mass structure _ are concerned , spirals within a suitably small interval of luminosity can be considered as essentially alike : the coaddition procedure , therefore , eliminates most of the observational errors , extracting the relevant information stored in individual curves .",
    "cr98 use two samples of galaxies .",
    "one comprises over a hundred @xmath11 sb / sc galaxies from courteau ( 1992 ) ; the other comprises several hundred late spirals from the mathewson et al .",
    "( 1992 ; hereafter mfb ) sample with @xmath40 .",
    "we then select from persic & salucci ( 1995 ; hereafter ps95 ) the rcs of mfb objects in the same luminosity range as cr98 . from this subsample",
    "we will generate a synthetic curve by coadding the individual curves .",
    "the procedure used is the following : we select galaxies with @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( the rc of objects of higher inclination are excluded because , due to obscuration effects , the h@xmath42 position  velocity curves may not correspond to true rotation velocities : see bosma et al .",
    "1992 and bosma 1995 ) .",
    "we then find 554 objects , with : @xmath43 , @xmath44 kpc .",
    "following pss we coadd the ( normalized ) velocity data and obtain a raw synthetic rc with about 12000 measurements , @xmath45 ) .. ] we then form the smoothed synthetic rc of @xmath11 galaxies , @xmath46 , by averaging the velocity data over 24 radial bins of size @xmath47 out to @xmath48 ( see fig.2 ) . _",
    "@xmath46 is the average rc of _ ( essentially ) _ the same sample whose residuals have been studied by cr98 . _",
    "in this section we check whether the innermost ( i.e. , for @xmath49 ) rcs of @xmath11 spiral galaxies are halo dominated .",
    "the test is straigthforward because for @xmath50 the velocity profile of a freeman ( 1970 ) disc is completely different from that of a post - infall cdm halo .",
    "we first fit @xmath46 with the hd mass model which has allowed cr98 to model the residuals @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( see fig.7 of cr98 ) for the same sample that we have used to construct @xmath46 . in detail",
    ", the model includes : _",
    "( i ) _ an exponential disc with @xmath51 kpc ; _ ( ii ) _ a stellar bulge with velocity profile peaking at @xmath52 ; _ ( iii ) _ a post - infall cdm dark halo ( see navarro 1998 ) .",
    "for this mass distribution @xmath53 has an initial @xmath54 profile and then a rapid convergence to a very shallow slope : setting @xmath55 , then : @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 .",
    "the cr98 model is plotted in fig.2_a _ alongside its individual components .",
    "it has one distinctive feature : about @xmath59 of the maximum velocity is reached at @xmath60 . by comparison , the exponential thin disc reaches the same fraction of the maximum velocity at a much larger radius , @xmath61 .",
    "notice that the step - like shape of the halo dominated rc is not due the bulge , which reaches its maximum velocity at the much smaller radius @xmath62 , but just reflects the shape of @xmath53 that , for @xmath63 , is steeper than @xmath64 . as a result",
    ", we realize that the model is inconsistent with the data , by predicting , for @xmath65 , a curvature in @xmath46 very different from the observed one .",
    "this failure does not occur only when testing the coadded rc , but also when we check individual rcs of high luminosity spirals that result severely inconsistent with the curve generated by the gravitational field of a dominant @xmath66-halo [ see the cases of ngc 2179 and ngc 2775 ( corsini et al .",
    "1998 ) , of ngc 5055 ( thornley & mundy 1997 ) and of ngc 5033 ( thean et al . 1997 ) , and a few more cases in begeman ( 1987 ) and rhee ( 1996 ) ] .",
    "next , we fit @xmath46 with a dd model .",
    "this should not be considered as a further test , but rather as the necessary check that the coadded rc can be reproduced by a natural mass distribution , i.e. the one which follows the distribution of light . applying dd models to samples with large luminosity ranges ( as in the case of cr98 ) requires , however , the luminosity bins to be smaller .",
    "then , in this case we analyse the rcs of mfb objects ( see ps95 ) having @xmath67 .",
    "( the reader is referred to pss for the analogous results concerning lower-@xmath21 galaxies . )",
    "the present subsample comprises 267 objects with global properties : @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 km s@xmath19 and @xmath71 kpc .",
    "the dd mass model we use includes : _",
    "( i ) _ a thin exponential disc with @xmath72 kpc ; _ ( ii ) _ a bulge , with a hernquist velocity profile ( practically indistinguishable from that used by cr98 ) : @xmath73 where @xmath74 kpc is the radius where the bulge velocity peaks ; _ ( iii ) _ a dark halo with velocity profile : @xmath75 where @xmath76 km s@xmath19 , @xmath77 is the `` velocity core radius '' ( in units of @xmath78 ) , and @xmath79 is essentially the stellar mass fraction at @xmath80 ( the bulge contributes only 6% of the mass at this radius ) .",
    "our adopted dd model , therefore , _ is not a best - fit model _ , but is chosen such as to only differ from the previously used hd model by ( mainly ) the disc dominance : the bulge is kept virtually frozen ( in normalized units ) , and the halo velocity profile is a simple fit to the velocity residuals .",
    "the dd model easily reproduces the data for @xmath81 within their rms errors ( see fig.2_b _ ) : at very small radii the detailed modelling of the bulge is crucial but is beyond our scope here .",
    "then we can conclude that , inside @xmath82 , the synthetic rc of high-@xmath21 objects does not trace the dark halo mass distribution : in fact , it does precisely trace the mass distribution of the stellar disc .",
    "a second test to check the ability of mass models to fit the rcs relies on the analysis of the outer rc profiles .",
    "the shapes of rcs can be essentially described by two quantities : the inner slope @xmath83 and the outer slope @xmath84/v(r_{opt})$ ] ( see pss ) . used in combination , @xmath85 and @xmath86 can help discriminating among apparently similar mass models .",
    "let us consider , for example , two radically different models that lead to curves approximately flat at @xmath87 : the `` light disc + @xmath66 halo '' model , and the `` dominant disc + constant - density halo '' model .",
    "halo '' models lead to curves that are respectively _ increasing _ and _ decreasing _ at @xmath88 . ] in the former case , @xmath89 and @xmath90 are both small in absolute value ( @xmath91 ) but are opposite in sign , thus @xmath92 implies also @xmath93 ; moreover , since the disc contribution for @xmath94 is negligible , then @xmath95 ( specifically , the cr98 model has : @xmath96 , @xmath97 ) . in the second case , @xmath98 and @xmath90",
    "are both a factor 3 - 4 larger than in the previous case : they approximately compensate each other in the range @xmath99 , but further out the disc term takes over because @xmath100 increases with radius while @xmath101 decreases : then the dominant disc model has @xmath102 and @xmath103 , with @xmath104 .",
    "we now check these predictions versus the observations . from the literature we select , following pss , 19 individual rcs of high-@xmath21 galaxies with a reliable profile out to @xmath105 .",
    "these 19 curves are representative of the sample of 554 used for test i. ( see figs.2 and 3 of pss : the shape parameters @xmath106 for the sample of individual rcs out of which these 19 are extracted , are consistent with the shape parameters of the coadded rcs built from essentially the same sample used in test i. ) using these curves , in fig.3 we see that very few objects have a pair @xmath107 consistent with hd models ( shaded area ) and none lies in the region predicted by the cr98 mass model ; moreover , @xmath108 of objects lay well inside the disc dominated region of the @xmath85-@xmath86 plane .",
    "finally , the constraint @xmath109 , predicted by the disc dominated model , is fully satisfied : the observed values are @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "again , these values are inconsistent with the prediction of hd models : @xmath112 , with @xmath113 .",
    "could high-@xmath21 spirals be completely halo dominated ?",
    "this can be effectively checked out by looking at their rcs : in fact , if the disc contribution to the rc is very small at all radii , the rc profile will essentially reflect that of the dark halo ; otherwise , the stellar disc component will leave a recognizable imprint on the shape of the rc .    by analysing the data for 554 inner rcs and 19 outer rcs of @xmath11 spirals , we have uncovered two clear dynamical imprints of a dominant disc .",
    "the first consists in a shallow extended rise in the rc between @xmath114 and @xmath115 , that results coincident with that predicted by the freeman ( 1970 ) disc ; the second consists in a net decrease , @xmath116 km s@xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath117 ) , of the circular velocity between one and two optical radii , again as predicted by a dominant disc .",
    "these features , predicted well before statistically relevant data were available ( salucci & frenk 1989 ) , are inconsistent with the predictions of hd models ( including the cr98 one ) .",
    "it is then obvious that mass models , featuring light discs and essentially constant velocity halos , give a poor fit to the data , while models featuring massive discs and dm halos with solid - body - like profiles out to @xmath118 match the data .    on the basis of the results of two tests ,",
    "one performed on the _ synthetic _ rc of high-@xmath21 galaxies ( seconded by literature results on several individual rcs ) and the other performed on about twenty _ individual _ rcs , we then reject the cr98 claim for halo dominated high-@xmath21 galaxies . [ with @xmath119 the mass in stars ( disc plus bulge ) ] : this , however , seems rather low for objects having @xmath120 ( e.g. : tinsley 1981 ; jablonka & arimoto 1992 ) like high-@xmath21 spirals . ]",
    "we conclude by emphasizing the existence of a characteristic length - scale @xmath121 such that , for radii @xmath122 the baryonic matter ( with total mass @xmath123 ) accounts for most ( e.g. , @xmath124 ) of the gravitating mass inside @xmath125 , and for @xmath126 the dark component ( whose contribution is minor at inner radii ) rapidly becomes a major mass component . from pss we can estimate : @xmath127 , with @xmath128 . for high-@xmath21 spirals",
    ", such `` inner baryon dominance '' extends to most of the disc region .",
