    "a plethora of observational data are now available , which show that we live in a flat universe that expands with an accelerating rate and that the dominant component in the energy budget of the universe is an unusual material , the nature of which still remains unknown .",
    "identifying the origin and nature of dark energy is one of the great challenges in modern theoretical cosmology .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the cosmological constant , which corresponds to a perfect fluid with state parameter @xmath3 .",
    "the lcdm model is still in agreement with all observational data .",
    "however , due to the problems associated to the cosmological constant , over the years many other theoretical models have been proposed and studied .",
    "one class of such models is based on some modification of einstein s gravity  @xcite and one is talking about the so - called geometrical dark energy models .",
    "another class contains the dynamical dark energy models , in which a new dynamical field ( almost certainly a scalar field ) is coupled to gravity . in the second class one would find models called quintessence  @xcite , phantom  @xcite , quintom  @xcite , k - essence  @xcite , tachyonic  @xcite etc",
    ". a recent review on dark energy dynamics one can find in  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , an attempt to solve , or at least to alleviate , the coincidence problem is realized in models of interacting dark energy  @xcite . in this class of models",
    "an interaction between the dark matter and dark energy is allowed , which after all is a natural possibility to be considered .",
    "nowadays several cosmological models of dark energy are available which can not be excluded by current observational data .",
    "however , a few years ago two new cosmological parameters were introduced  @xcite in order to discriminate between different dark energy models .",
    "these are the so called statefinder parameters and are given entirely in terms of the scale factor and its derivatives with respect to the cosmic time , up to the third order .",
    "the statefinder parameters are defined as follows @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scale factor of the universe , @xmath6 is the hubble parameter , a dot denotes differentiation with respect to the cosmic time @xmath7 and @xmath8 is the deceleration parameter @xmath9 after the deceleration parameter with the second derivative of the scale factor with respect to the cosmic time , a natural quantity to be considered is @xmath10 with the third derivative of @xmath5 with respect to @xmath7 . for the lcdm model , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . at this point the easiest way to see this is to consider the evolution of the universe at large times , that is when the contribution from matter is negligible .",
    "then the universe expands due to the cosmological constant only and the scale factor grows exponentially with time , @xmath13",
    ". then one can immediately see that @xmath11 and therefore @xmath12 ( since @xmath8=-1 ) .",
    "the trajectories in the @xmath14 plane for various existing models can exhibit quite different behaviors .",
    "the deviation of these trajectories from the @xmath15 point defines the distance of a given model from the lcdm model .",
    "the statefinder pair ( @xmath0 ) can successfully differentiate between a wide variety of cosmological models including a cosmological constant , brane models , quintessence , chaplygin gas , and interacting dark energy models . in a given model",
    "the pair @xmath16 can be computed and the trajectory in the @xmath14 plane can be drown .",
    "furthermore , the values of @xmath0 can be extracted from future observations  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the statefinder diagnostic combined with future observations may possibly be used to discriminate between different dark energy models .    up to now , the statefinder diagnostic has been applied to several models , see e.g.  @xcite . in the present work",
    "we wish to study two dark energy models . in the first we consider in four - dimensional general relativity a two fluid model with dark matter and dark energy interacting with each other . the form of the interaction is specified below .",
    "we do not rely on a concrete particle physics model for dark energy .",
    "we just treat dark energy as a hydrodynamical fluid with a constant state parameter @xmath17 , where @xmath18 are the pressure and energy density of dark energy respectively . in the second model",
    ", we consider the dgp brane model generalized by taking into account a possible energy exchange between the brane and the bulk .",
    "the equations of motion for our system are friedmann equations and the semi - conservation equation for each fluid component @xmath19 where @xmath20 is a source term responsible for the interaction between the two fluid components , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the energy density of matter ( @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 is the total energy density and @xmath25 is the total pressure .",
    "the first friedmann equation is a constraint , while the second one is a dynamical equation .",
    "below we shall assume that the interaction term @xmath20 takes the form @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a dimensionless quantity which for simplicity is taken to be a constant . as a matter of fact the present model with the given form of the interaction term was very recently compared to observational data  @xcite . in that work",
    "it was found that the allowed range for @xmath28 is the following @xmath29 @xmath30 @xmath31 while the best - fit parameters were found to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the present value of the normalized density of dark energy .",
    "the normalized densities for matter and dark energy are defined by @xmath34 and each of them @xmath35 .",
    "then the first friedmann equation takes the form @xmath36 the second friedmann equation is written in terms of the normalized densities @xmath37 where @xmath38 . if we define @xmath39 we can write down the equation of motion for @xmath40 or @xmath41 with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "one finds @xmath43 and @xmath44 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath42 .",
    "we see that @xmath45 , as it should since @xmath46 .",
    "since only one of the normalized densities is independent , we shall consider the equation of motion for @xmath41 and for simplicity we shall drop the index @xmath47 below .",
    "it is obvious that there are two critical points , namely @xmath48 to determine the stability of the critical points we have to linearize the system .",
    "for the first critical point we set @xmath49 and we obtain @xmath50 which means that the critical point is stable for @xmath51 and unstable for @xmath52 .",
    "in fact according to the values obtained observationally the critical point @xmath53 is stable .",
    "for the second critical point @xmath54 we set @xmath55 and we obtain @xmath56 which means that it is unstable .    up to now we have determined the number and stability of the critical points of the system .",
    "now we shall focus to the stable critical point and obtain the values of @xmath0 corresponding to that . using the equations of motion and the definition for the statefinder parameters we obtain @xmath57 notice that for the lcdm model ,",
    "for which @xmath58 and @xmath59 , one obtains that @xmath60 at every instant of time and not only at large times . at the critical point",
    "@xmath61 their values are given by @xmath62 notice that the dependence on the interaction @xmath27 drops out and the values of the statefinder parameters at the stable critical point only depend on the dark energy state parameter @xmath63 . for a @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , that is",
    "the point ( @xmath1 ) is only slightly different from that corresponding to lcdm .",
    "the ( @xmath2 ) plane for this model is shown in fig .  1 ,",
    "in which the different orbits correspond to different values of @xmath67 . for the numerical demands we have let @xmath39 go up to @xmath68 , which is sufficient for our purposes .",
    "the statefinders @xmath0 as functions of red - shift are shown in fig .  3 and fig .  4 .",
    "the present values of @xmath0 are as follows     @xmath69 & @xmath70 + @xmath71 , @xmath72 & @xmath73 & @xmath74 + @xmath71 , @xmath75 & @xmath76 & @xmath77 +    finally , in fig .",
    "5 we show as a comparison where the curves corresponding to quintessence and constant @xmath63 without an interaction are located on the ( @xmath2 ) plane .",
    "we shall now discuss another dark energy model , this time a brane model .",
    "in particular we wish to study the dgp model  @xcite taking into account the energy exchange between the brane and the bulk  @xcitec .",
    "let us first review the basic formulae that we shall be using .",
    "the model is defined by the action @xmath78 plus a matter content both in the bulk and on the brane , where @xmath79 are the ricci scalars of the bulk metric @xmath80 and the induced metric @xmath81 respectively .",
    "the five - dimensional planck mass is @xmath82 , the bulk cosmological constant is @xmath83 , the brane tension is @xmath84 , and the induced - gravity crossover scale is @xmath85 . assuming a flat universe and a perfect fluid on the brane with state parameter @xmath63 , the cosmological equations on the brane read @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the term responsible for the energy exchange between the brane and the bulk and it is assumed to have the form @xmath88",
    "@xcite with @xmath89 constants .",
    "the case @xmath90 corresponds to outflow while the case @xmath91 corresponds to influx .",
    "the new parameters @xmath92 are related to the old ones @xmath93 by @xmath94 and adopting the randall - sundrum condition , @xmath95 .",
    "the critical point analysis has be done in ref .",
    "@xcitec and in the case of dust and influx the results can be shown in the table below     @xmath96 + no . of f.p .",
    "& 1 & 0 or 1 & 1 + nature & & & +    where the second row shows the number of critical points , while the third row shows the nature of the fixed points , attractor ( a ) or saddle ( s ) .",
    "below we shall be interested in the @xmath97 case , since this is when the system possesses always a unique attractor .",
    "for the critical point analysis it is useful to define appropriate dimensionless quantities .",
    "defining @xmath98 where @xmath99 , we obtain the equations @xmath100 \\label{gerold}\\\\ & & \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!z'\\!=\\!(1\\!-\\!z^{2})\\big[(1\\!-\\!z^{2 } ) \\frac{1\\!-\\!z^{2}\\!-\\!3(1\\!-\\!3w)\\beta^{2}\\mu^{-1}\\omega_{m}}{1\\!-\\!\\omega_{m}}-1\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\ , \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,-\\frac{1\\!+\\!3w}{2}\\omega_{m}\\big ] \\label{italy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath101 , while the deceleration parameter is given by @xmath102\\label{greece}\\ ] ] now we shall determine the statefinder parameters in terms of @xmath103 using their definition and the cosmological equations .",
    "the expressions are lengthy , therefore we choose to express them in term of the deceleration parameter @xmath104 one understands that by taking the derivative of @xmath8 with respect to @xmath105 and using the equations of motion for @xmath103 , it is possible to express @xmath0 in terms of the latter variables . in practice , we solve the system numerically and obtain @xmath103 as functions of @xmath105 .",
    "then we compute @xmath106 and finally the statefinder parameters @xmath107 . at the critical points , @xmath108 and in this particular model",
    "it turns out  @xcitec that @xmath109 always holds . therefore we find that @xmath110 at the critical points .",
    "these are the values corresponding to the lcdm model .",
    "the ( @xmath2 ) plane for this model is shown in fig .  2 ,",
    "in which the different orbits correspond to different values of @xmath111 . for our computational needs",
    "we have allowed the mathematical time @xmath105 go up to @xmath112 , although a few tens would also be sufficient .",
    "the basic idea pursued in  @xcitec was that our universe is close to the unique attractor of the system studied . therefore today s values of @xmath0 are approximately the ones corresponding to the fixed point .",
    "contrary to the previous four - dimensional interacting model , we can not show for a comparison in the same ( @xmath2 ) plot the curves corresponding to the brane model and to quintessence and constant @xmath63 without an interaction .",
    "the reason is because the curves for quintessence and constant @xmath63 are located close to the cosmological constant point ( @xmath113 ) and can not be seen in the plot . finally , in fig .",
    "6,7 we show the statefinder parameters @xmath1 as functions of red - shift @xmath114 for three different values of @xmath111 .",
    "to summarize our work , we have considered two dark energy models . in the first model we have considered in four - dimensional general relativity a two fluid model in which an interaction is allowed between dark energy and dark matter .",
    "we have treated dark energy as a hydrodynamical fluid with a constant state parameter @xmath63 and we have not relied on a concrete particle physics model for dark energy . using dynamical system methods",
    "we have determined the number and stability of the critical points of the system .",
    "we have found that there is a stable and an unstable critical point and have computed the values of the pair ( @xmath1 ) corresponding to the stable critical point .",
    "it turns out that these values depend on the dark energy state parameter @xmath63 only and that the dependence on the interaction @xmath27 drops out .",
    "our conclusion is that for the observational value of @xmath64 , the values of ( @xmath1 ) for the system under study is only slightly different from that of lcdm . in the other model we have considered the dgp brane model taking into account a possible energy exchange between the brane and the bulk .",
    "the assumed form for this energy exchange as well as the number and nature of the critical points for this model have been previously discussed .",
    "here we have determined the values of the statefinder parameters corresponding to the unique attractor of the model and we have shown that are identical to the values corresponding to the lcdm model .",
    "finally , we have generated plots in which we show @xmath1 as functions of red - shift , and the ( @xmath2 ) plane for each model .",
    "we would like to thank the anonymous reviewer for his / her valuable comments and suggestions that greatly improved the quality of the presentation .",
