    "an understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking is currently one of the most important objectives in high energy particle physics .",
    "renormalizability requires that electroweak symmetry be spontaneously broken ; in the minimal standard model , this is realized by the condensation of the elementary higgs field .",
    "in such a theory , however , the squared higgs mass receives quadratically divergent radiative corrections . the higgs mass , and with it the weak scale , is therefore expected to be of order the cut - off scale , which is typically identified with the grand unified theory ( gut ) or planck scale .",
    "the fact that the weak scale is much smaller than the cut - off scale requires a large fine - tuning and is therefore considered unnatural in the minimal standard model  @xcite .",
    "supersymmetry removes quadratic divergences and therefore provides a framework for naturally explaining the stability of the weak scale with respect to radiative corrections  @xcite .",
    "however , the requirement of naturalness constrains supersymmetric models , as , in these models , the weak scale is generated when electroweak symmetry breaking is induced by ( negative ) squared mass parameters for the higgs scalars .",
    "the weak scale is therefore related to these supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "it is hoped that an understanding of the mechanism of supersymmetry breaking will shed light on the origin of the weak scale . even without this knowledge ,",
    "though , it is clear that naturalness in supersymmetric theories requires that the supersymmetry breaking parameters in the higgs potential be not too far above the weak scale .    as naturalness implies _ upper _ bounds on supersymmetry breaking parameters and superpartner masses , its implications are obviously of great importance for supersymmetry searches .",
    "these implications depend on the assumed structure of supersymmetry breaking . with respect to the scalar masses , broadly speaking , three possibilities exist . in the first , all supersymmetry breaking scalar mass parameters are roughly of the same order ; for example , they may be of the same order when generated at some high scale and then remain of the same order when evolved through renormalization group ( rg ) equations to the weak scale .",
    "naturalness then demands that scalar higgs , squark , and slepton masses all be near the weak scale .",
    "such light particles are within the discovery reach of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and future lepton colliders .",
    "another possibility is that a hierarchy exists between the various scalar masses .",
    "this hierarchy may be present at the scale at which supersymmetry breaking parameters are generated  @xcite or may be generated dynamically through rg evolution  @xcite . in either case , one finds that naturalness bounds on the first and second generation squarks and sleptons are much weaker than those for the third generation  @xcite .",
    "first and second generation sfermions may then be much heavier than 1 tev and far beyond the reach of near future colliders .",
    "however , top and bottom squarks , for example , are still constrained to have masses of order the weak scale , and should be discovered by the lhc .",
    "a third possibility , however , is that the rg trajectories of the higgs mass parameters may meet at a `` focus point ''  @xcite , where their values are independent of their ultraviolet boundary values .",
    "if this focus point is near the weak scale , the higgs potential at the weak scale may be insensitive to the ultraviolet values of certain supersymmetry breaking parameters , including the scalar masses . in this case , naturalness , while constraining ( unphysical ) higgs mass parameters , may lead to very weak upper bounds on the squark , slepton , and heavy higgs boson masses , and these scalars may _ all _ be beyond the reach of near future colliders .",
    "the last possibility is the subject of this study .",
    "we will show that it is realized in a class of models that includes minimal supergravity .",
    "minimal supergravity is at present probably the single most widely - studied framework for evaluating the potential of new experiments to probe physics beyond the standard model .",
    "we therefore concentrate on this model and explore the implications of focus points in minimal supergravity for naturalness and the superpartner spectrum .",

    "in this section , we explore the phenomenon of focus points in the rg evolution of supersymmetry breaking parameters .",
    "we will see that , in certain circumstances , the supersymmetry breaking up - type higgs mass has such a focus point at the weak scale , where it becomes insensitive to its boundary value at the high scale ( for example , the gut scale ) . since the supersymmetry breaking masses for the higgses",

    "we do not subscribe to this view .",
    "does not imply that current experimental data are ignored in the calculation of fine - tuning .",
    "all experimental data are used in step ( _ ii _ ) of the fine - tuning prescription to specify the physical hypersurface of parameter space . ]",
    "if in the future the higgsino mass @xmath120 is measured to be 10 tev , given our current notions of naturalness , we believe this should be considered fine - tuned , irrespective of the accuracy with which the higgsino mass is measured .",
    "of course , if this were the case , the fact that a 10 tev @xmath120 parameter is realized in nature would be a strong motivation to consider alternative , and perhaps more fundamental , theoretical frameworks in which a 10 tev @xmath120 parameter is not unnatural .",
    "there are , however , other considerations which favor the exclusion of standard model parameters from the list of @xmath113 . as noted in sec .",
    "[ sec : natural ] , we are interested in the naturalness of the supersymmetric explanation of the gauge hierarchy .",
    "we should not require that supersymmetry also solve the problem of flavor .",
    "in fact , in many supergravity frameworks , the supersymmetry breaking parameters and the yukawa couplings are expected to be determined independently . for example , in hidden sector scenarios , the supersymmetry breaking parameters are determined in one sector , while the yukawa couplings are fixed in some other sector and by a completely independent mechanism . in this case , it seems reasonable to assume that @xmath27 is fixed to its observed value in some sector not connected to supersymmetry breaking , and we therefore should not consider variations with respect to it .    finally , it is worth noting that there are several possible scenarios in which it is clear that @xmath215 should not be included in @xmath119 or is at least negligibly small .",
    "one possibility is that @xmath27 may evolve from some higher scale , such as the planck scale , to a fixed or focus point at the gut scale .",
    "the weak scale is then highly insensitive to variations in the truly fundamental parameter , i.e. , @xmath27 at the planck scale .",
    "alternatively , the top yukawa coupling may arise as a renormalizable operator with coefficient determined by a correlation function of string vertex operators .",
    "the coupling @xmath27 would then be fixed to its current value ( or possibly one of a discrete set of values ) , and it is again inappropriate to consider continuous variations with respect to @xmath27 . note that in both of these scenarios , @xmath27 may receive additional contributions from non - renormalizable operators of the form @xmath218 , where @xmath219 is a coupling constant , and @xmath220 is some small expansion parameter , such as @xmath221 , where @xmath222 is some vacuum expectation value . in this case ,",
