    "for understanding the basic physics of high-@xmath4 superconductivity , the two - dimensional @xmath0-@xmath1 model has been extensively studied as one of the most promising and simplified models which describe charge and spin dynamics in the cuo@xmath5 plane.@xcite mean - field theories@xcite and numerical calculations@xcite have shown that the d@xmath6 wave superconductivity ( sc ) takes place in a reasonable parameter region in the phase diagram ( @xmath7 and the doping rate @xmath8 ) .",
    "therefore , as far as the d - wave sc is concerned , the experimentally observed phase diagram of high-@xmath4 superconductors and the results in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model agree quite well .",
    "recently , however , there are some experiments which indicate the importance of the interplay between the antiferromagnetism and d - wave sc .",
    "the most interesting phenomenon is a realization of stripe state in some materials , which has charge ordering as well as incommensurate antiferromagnetic ( af ) spin ordering.@xcite other potential problems are the af state induced around nonmagnetic impurities and a possibility of af vortex cores.@xcite    in order to study these problems , it is necessary to develop a theory in which the d - wave sc and the af correlation are treated in a reliable way .",
    "usual mean - field theories generally overestimate the af long - range order , so that they give unphysical results even in the uniform case . in this paper",
    "we develop a new type of analytic theory which gives a reliable estimate of the af correlation as well as the d - wave sc .",
    "our scheme is an extension of the gutzwiller approximation.@xcite    in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model the double occupancy of up- and down - spin electrons at any site is prohibited . to study its ground state ,",
    "it is natural to use a projected mean - field wave function in which the double occupancies are excluded.@xcite as the mean - field wave functions , a sdw mean - field solution at half filling,@xcite bcs wave functions,@xcite and a coexistent state of the af and d - wave sc@xcite have been used .",
    "variational energies are calculated in the variational monte carlo ( vmc ) simulations , which treat exactly the constraints of no double occupancies . among the above trial states , the coexistent state has the lowerest variational energy in the doping region @xmath9.@xcite    on the other hand , the analytic theories in which the constraint is treated approximately give large discrepancies in the estimation of the af correlation .",
    "for example , in the slave - boson mean - field theory which takes account of the constraint as an average , the af order is too overestimated and it extends up to unphysical doping rates ( @xmath10).@xcite thus in the slave - boson theory , we are unable to discuss the stripe state , for example , because it is stabilized near @xmath11 doping where the slave - boson theory gives the af state even for the bulk .",
    "the gutzwiller approximation is more advanced approximation than the simple mean - field theories in treating the constraint .",
    "renormalizations of expectation values are introduced by comparing the statistical weighting factors in the wave functions with and without projection.@xcite as a result , the parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 are renormalized to @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "it has been shown that the gutzwiller approximation gives a fairly reliable estimation of the variational energy for the pure d - wave sc state when it is compared with the vmc results.@xcite however it was shown that there is no region in the phase diagram where the af state is stabilized.@xcite this contradicts with the vmc results .    in order to clarify the origin of these discrepancies , we investigated the vmc data@xcite and found that the gutzwiller approximation has to be modified when the af correlations are present . based on these observations , we extend the gutzwiller approximation in this paper and derive an analytic formalism for the renormalization factors which reproduces the vmc results . we show that it is important to take account of the longer - range correlations for the weighting factors , in contrast to the previous approximation where only the site - diagonal expectation values such as @xmath14 are considered . as a result ,",
    "the renormalization factors for @xmath0 and @xmath1 have nonlinear dependences on the expectation values of cooper pairs and af moment .",
    "we think that this is the essence of the strong correlation in the sense that the renormalization appears solely from the projection operators .",
    "the merit of the present scheme is that it can be easily applied to the inhomogeneous systems , where the vmc simulations are not so feasible .",
    "thus a reliable analytic formulation can be given to the problems , such as the stripe state , vortex cores and states around impurities , where the interplay between the af and d - wave sc plays an important role .",
    "preliminary results of these problems have been described elsewhere.@xcite    the outline of this paper is as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the formulation of the original gutzwiller approximation in order to make the present paper self - contained .",
    "we also show our final results for the extended gutzwiller approximation before going into the details of the derivation . in sec .",
    "iii , the original gutzwiller approximation is extended in order to include longer - range correlations .",
    "we divide the whole system into cells and introduce the configurations in each cell for evaluating the weighting factors . using the general formulation developed in sec .",
    "iii , we obtain the renormalization factors for the half - filled case in sec .",
    "we approximate the weighting factors in a perturbative way with respect to the nearest - neighbor correlations . in iv.d , the physical origin of the enhancement of the renormalization factor for the @xmath2-component of exchange interaction",
    "is discussed in a viewpoint of statistical weights of real - space spin configurations . in sec .",
    "v , the results at half filling are generalized to the less - than - half - filled case .",

    "these gutzwiller factors , however , do not reproduce the vmc results , as mentioned in i. we find that this discrepancy is due to the fact that only the site - diagonal expectation values are taken into account in obtaining eq .",

    "this corresponds to taking account of the effect of surroundings of the corresponding bond .",

    "it is worth while noting here that , due to the su(2 ) symmetry , the coexistent state of the af and d - wave sc is equivalent to the @xmath245-flux state with af long range order discussed by hsu.@xcite    the self - consistent value , @xmath246 in eq .",

    "if @xmath34 is increased from the self - consistent value , @xmath36 decreases .",
    "this indicates that @xmath34 is determined so as to minimize the exchange energy @xmath248 by optimizing the energy gain due to the long - range order and the energy loss due to the reduction of @xmath36 .",

    "\\(4 ) for less - than - half - filled case , the difference between the variational parameter @xmath241 and the expectation value @xmath233 is remarkable : @xmath241 is finite and moreover it increases as the doping rate @xmath32 decreases , while @xmath233 is proportional to @xmath32 near half filling .",
    "this is because the gutzwiller factor , @xmath250 , is proportional to @xmath32 ( see section vi ) .",

    "\\(5 ) we discuss here the relation to the so(5 ) theory.@xcite in our formulation , the combination @xmath251 appears frequently .",
    "if the so(5 ) symmetry is exact in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model , the free energy will have a systematic dependence such as f(^2+m^2 ) f(_exp^2+m_exp^2 ) .",
    "for example , the numerator in @xmath252 has a combination 16(m^2+^2+^2 ) .",
    "also the factor giving the enhancement of @xmath36 contains 4m^2+x_2 = 4m^2 + 2 ^ 2 + 2 ^ 2 .",
    "although these combinations remind us of the so(5 ) symmetry , our gutzwiller approximation does not show exact symmetry .",
    "nevertheless a tendency similar to the so(5 ) prediction can be seen from the gutzwiller factors in fig .",
    "1 . comparing @xmath38 and @xmath36 for the cases with @xmath253 and @xmath44",
    ", we find that @xmath38 and @xmath36 are larger for smaller @xmath115 .",
    "this is mainly from the exclusion effect of @xmath252 , because even at @xmath164 this effect is observed .",
    "therefore if we consider a situation where the d - wave sc order parameter is suppressed , then the gutzwiller factor is enhanced causing the increase of af moment .",
    "this gives the similar phenomena predicted in the so(5 ) theory.@xcite    \\(6 ) one advantage of the present theory is that it is easily applied to the inhomogeneous cases , such as the stripe state , vortex cores , and magnetic states around nonmagnetic or magnetic impurities , where the interplay between the af and d - wave sc correlations plays an important role .",
    "since our gutzwiller approximation gives a reasonable estimate of the variational energies in the presence of af correlations , a reliable analytic formulation can be given .",
    "the simplest way of applying the present scheme to inhomogeneous problems is to assume that @xmath45 and @xmath28 for each bond @xmath254 are determined locally from the expectation values @xmath255 and @xmath256 for the bond . in this case , if the d - wave order parameter is reduced around vortex cores , impurities or stripes , then the gutzwiller factors @xmath38 and @xmath36 are enhanced locally as expected from fig .  1 .",
    "this effect causes the local development of af correlations , which can be observed experimentally . from these viewpoint ,",
    "preliminary calculations for the vortex cores@xcite and stripe states@xcite have been published elsewhere .",
    "of course the vmc simulations give more accurate evaluation of the variational energies , if they are used for the inhomogeneous systems like stripe states .",
    "however there are some difficulties in applying the vmc .",
    "firstly we have to treat a fairly large unit cell to study the slowly varying order parameters especially near half filling.@xcite for example , the incommensurability in the stripe state is close to @xmath257 so that the period of the stripe pattern becomes fairly long . in this case",
    "the vmc simulations become difficult . furthermore the choice of the functional form of the trial state in vmc is restricted , since only the small number of variational parameters can be used practically . on the contrary , our scheme based on the mean - field - type gutzwiller approximation can be used in a fairly large system sizes .",
    "moreover the order parameters on all the bonds , @xmath255 and @xmath258 can be optimized in the similar sense to unrestricted hartree - fock theory .",
    "therefore we can search for the microscopically optimized variational states in our scheme.@xcite    the authors wish to thank t.  m.  rice , h.  fukuyama , y.  tanaka , h.  tsuchiura and m.  sigrist for useful discussions .",
    "they also thank c .- m .  ho for critical reading of the manuscript .",
