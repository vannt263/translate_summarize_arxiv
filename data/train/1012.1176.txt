    "stars form in dense ( @xmath12 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) molecular - cloud cores .",
    "the iras survey of dense cores has revealed that approximately half of dense cores are associated with bright ( @xmath12 0.1 @xmath15 ) infrared point sources , and the dense cores associated with the iras sources have been considered as dense cores with the onset of the star formation @xcite .",
    "recent high - sensitivity mid- and far - infrared observations with the spitzer space telescope ( @xmath11 25 times higher sensitivity than with iras ) , however , have found infrared point sources in dense cores previously thought to be starless .",
    "the first such `` starless '' core is l1014 , where young et al .",
    "( 2004 ) have discovered a spitzer source ( l1014-irs ) with a faint internal luminosity ( @xmath16 @xmath11 0.09 @xmath15 ) .",
    "the internal ( star+disk ) luminosity , @xmath16 , is defined as @xmath17 ",
    "@xmath18 , where @xmath18 , typically @xmath11 0.2 @xmath15 , is the luminosity due to the interstellar radiation field .",
    "molecular - line observations have found plenty of dense molecular gas associated with l1014-irs , which could accrete onto and further raise the mass of the central object @xcite .",
    "a compact ( @xmath11 500 au ) molecular outflow has also been found with the sma in l1014-irs @xcite .",
    "subsequent surveys of low - mass star - forming regions with spitzer have discovered more infrared sources in dense cores previously thought to be starless @xcite . those spitzer sources with rising or flat seds between the longest detected spitzer irac wavelength and mips 24 @xmath19 as well as between 24 and 70 @xmath19 , and @xmath16 below or equal to 0.1 @xmath15 , are dubbed `` very low luminosity objects '' or vellos @xcite .",
    "so far , @xmath11 15 vellos have been identified out of 67 `` starless cores '' , including l1014-irs , mentioned above , and hence @xmath11 80 @xmath20 of these `` starless '' cores remain starless down to the sensitivity limit of @xmath16 @xmath12 4 @xmath21 10@xmath22 ( @xmath23/140 pc)@xmath24 @xcite . because of the characteristics of their seds and the very low internal luminosity , those vellos could represent the very early phase of star formation with a lower central stellar mass and/or mass accretion rate than those of typical class 0 sources .",
    "the detection of faint @xmath25 emission coincident with l1014-irs , however , suggests that l1014-irs may not be a young protostellar source , although it is difficult to tell whether part of the @xmath25 emission directly arises from the central star or entirely from the reflection nebula tracing the envelope cavity presumably evacuated by an outflow @xcite .",
    "l1521f is one of `` starless '' cores in taurus , where the spitzer survey has revealed the presence of a vello , l1521f - irs ( @xmath16 @xmath11 0.06 @xmath15 ) @xcite .",
    "l1521f - irs was directly detected at mid - infrared wavelengths ( 24 and 70 @xmath26 m ) , while at shorter infrared wavelengths ( @xmath27 5 @xmath26 m ) only the scattered light was detected .",
    "the scattered light shows a bipolar nebulosity oriented along the east to west direction , which probably traces an outflow cavity .",
    "the 1.3 mm and 850 @xmath26 m continuum maps in l1521f show a centrally - peaked dusty condensation with a mass of 1.5 @xmath28 around l1521f - irs @xcite .",
    "the position of the spitzer source is approximately ( within @xmath11 5@xmath29 ) consistent with the peak position of the dust - continuum emission @xcite . in the central 20@xmath29 region",
    "the molecular hydrogen density ( @xmath30 ) is estimated to be @xmath11 10@xmath31 @xmath14 , and co molecules are depleted by a factor of 15 from the nominal co abundance of 9.5 @xmath21 10@xmath32 @xcite .",
    "bima observations of l1521f in the ccs ( @xmath33 = 3@xmath52@xmath34 ) and n@xmath5h@xmath35 ( 10 ) lines have shown that the n@xmath5h@xmath35 emission correlates well with the dust - continuum emission while the ccs emission traces the outer region surrounding the n@xmath5h@xmath35 emission @xcite .",
    "onishi et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have studied l1521f ( mc 27 in their paper ) in millimeter and submillimeter hco@xmath35 ( @xmath36 = 43 , 32 ) and h@xmath8co@xmath35 ( @xmath36 = 43 , 32 , 10 ) lines and have found a highly condensed gas structure and a signature of infalling motion with an infalling velocity of 0.2 - 0.3 km s@xmath37 at 2000 - 3000 au .",
    "they have also found that only the central position of the hco@xmath35 ( @xmath36=32 ) line shows winglike components ( 5.0 - 5.8 km s@xmath37 and 7.4 - 8.6 km s@xmath37 ) , suggesting the compactness of the associated molecular outflow . from these results , they suggested , before the discovery of the vello , that l1521f is on the verge of star formation .",
    "iram 04191 + 1522 ( hereafter iram 04191 ) has previously been identified as a class 0 protostar with its very low t@xmath38 of @xmath11 18 k , located in the southern part of the taurus molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "spitzer observations have revealed that iram 04191 is another vello with @xmath16 @xmath11 0.08 @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "iram 04191 was directly detected as an infrared point source at all six wavelengths observed by spitzer ( 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 , 24 , and 70 @xmath26 m ) , associated with a nebulosity at wavelengths shorter than 24 @xmath26 m extending to the south .",
    "the spitzer source position agrees within 0.2@xmath29 with the source position given by belloche et al .",
    "( 2002 ) based on the 227 ghz continuum emission detected by the iram pdbi interferometer .",
    "iram 04191 is associated with a well - developed ( @xmath12 10000 au ) molecular outflow extending from northeast ( red ) to southwest ( blue ) , which appears to be similar to outflows from more luminous protostars @xcite .",
    "the southern infrared nebulosity appears to be consistent with the blueshifted molecular outflow @xcite .",
    "millimeter molecular - line observations of iram 04191 show a 10000-au scale rotating molecular envelope around iram 04191 @xcite .",
    "comparison between the 1.3 mm dust - continuum and n@xmath5h@xmath35 ( 10 ) observations of iram 04191 shows that n@xmath5h@xmath35 depletion by a factor of @xmath11 4 is present at the center of the envelope ( @xmath39 @xmath27 1600 au , @xmath30 @xmath12 5 @xmath21 10@xmath13 @xmath14 ) , whereas at the outer part the n@xmath5h@xmath35 emission correlates with the dust - continuum emission @xcite .",
    "it is still not clear , however , how to track the evolutionary stage and the differences among these vellos .",
    "the chemical status of dense gas around the vellos could be a key , since chemistry in dense cores is non - equilibrium and time - dependent ( e.g. leung et al .",
    "1984 ; herbst & leung 1989 ) .",
    "carbon - chain molecules are of particular interest .",
    "since carbon - chain molecules are produced through hydrogenation of c@xmath35 and c , and carbon in the form of c@xmath35 and c is only present at the early ( @xmath40 10@xmath13 yr ) evolutionary stage of the chemical evolution ,",
    "they are likely to trace the early evolutionary stage of star formation . observations of organic molecules such as ch@xmath0oh and ch@xmath0cn towards vellos are also intriguing . at",
    "the `` real '' starless phase the low temperatures at the central regions result in the depletion of most molecules onto dust grains .",
    "once a protostellar source forms at the center of the dense core , heating from the protostar desorbs molecules from grain surfaces , and the desorption region extends as the protostellar evolution proceeds @xcite . since organic molecules are thought to be formed on grain surfaces @xcite ( for example ch@xmath0oh is formed through hydrogenation of co on grain surfaces ) , the amount of organic molecules in the gas phase towards vellos could be an independent measure of the evolutionary stage .    in order to study the chemical status of the molecular material surrounding vellos and to investigate the evolution of the earliest protostellar formation , we have conducted observations of l1521f and iram 04191 in several carbon - chain and organic molecular lines with the nobeyama 45-m telescope .",
    "our observations of the two representative vellos in carbon - chain and organic molecular lines should shed light on the chemical evolutional status of dense gas surrounding these vellos and the initial stage of star formation .",
    "observations of l1521f - irs and iram 04191 were carried out in the carbon - chain and organic molecular lines listed in table 1 with the 45 m telescope at nobeyama radio observatory from 10th to 18th on march , 2008 .",
    "all the molecular lines listed in table 1 were observed simultaneously with two sis - mixer receivers ( s80 and s100 ) , s80 for the 85 ghz lines and s100 for the 110 ghz lines .",
    "the beam squint between the two receivers was confirmed to be less than 1@xmath29 .",
    "typical single - sideband ( ssb ) system noise temperatures were @xmath11 270 k and @xmath11 330 k for s80 and s100 , respectively .",
    "the beam size and the main beam efficiency of the telescope were 18@xmath29 and 42@xmath20 at 85 ghz and 15@xmath29 and 40@xmath20 at 110 ghz .",
    "the telescope pointing was checked every 90 - 120 minutes by observing the sio maser emission from nml - tau at 43 ghz , and was confirmed to be better than 5@xmath29 .",
    "the position - switching mode was adopted for our observations .",
    "a bank of eight high - resolution acousto - optical spectrometers ( aos ) with a bandwidth of 40 mhz and a frequency resolution of 37 khz was used as a backend .",
    "the frequency resolution corresponds to 0.13 km s@xmath37at 85 ghz and 0.10 km s@xmath37at 110 ghz .",
    "our observations consisted of two parts ; one - point observations towards l1521f - irs ( @xmath41@xmath42 = 04@xmath43 28@xmath44 38@xmath4595 , @xmath46@xmath42 = 26@xmath47 51@xmath48 35@xmath491 ) and iram 04191 ( @xmath41@xmath42 = 04@xmath43 21@xmath44 56@xmath459 , @xmath46@xmath42 = 15@xmath47 29@xmath48 46@xmath494 ) , and mapping observations around these two sources .",
    "the one - point observations were conducted every observing day to calibrate the intensity variation caused by the receiver gains and/or sky conditions and to obtain high signal - to - noise ratio spectra with a long integration time .",
    "the resultant total on - source integration times over the whole observing day were 39.7 minutes for l1521f irs and 43.7 minutes for iram 04191 .",
    "the intensity variation during the whole observing period was confirmed to be within 20 @xmath20 .",
    "the results obtained from the one - point observations are summarized in figure 1 and table 2 .",
    "the mapping observations were performed at a grid spacing of 10@xmath29 and position angles of 0@xmath50 and 30@xmath50 in l1521f and iram 04191 , respectively , to align the mapping grid to the axis of the associated outflow . with a typical integration time of 3 minutes per pointing ,",
    "typical rms noise levels of @xmath11 0.2 k at 85 ghz and @xmath11 0.3 k at 110 ghz in units of @xmath51 were obtained ( hereafter we present line intensities in units of @xmath51 ) .",
    "figure [ spec ] shows profiles of the carbon - chain and organic molecular lines towards l1521f - irs and iram 04191 , taken from the one - point observations .",
    "all the molecular lines listed in table 1 , except for the ch@xmath0cn ( @xmath52 = 6@xmath535@xmath53 ) , and the higher - energy ch@xmath0oh ( @xmath54 = 6@xmath97@xmath10 e ) , c@xmath0h@xmath5 ( @xmath55 = 4@xmath564@xmath57 ) , and the ch@xmath0cch ( @xmath52 = 5@xmath534@xmath53 ; k @xmath58 2 ) lines , were detected above 3@xmath59 in both sources .",
    "table 2 summarizes the observed line parameters , derived from single - component gaussian fittings to these spectra unless otherwise noted .",

    "the difference in the intensities of the carbon - chain molecular lines is likely to reflect the different chemical compositions of the dense gas around l1521f - irs and iram 04191 .",
    "we will discuss this point in more detail .",
    "the @xmath8co ( 10 ) emission towards l1521f - irs exhibits two velocity components at @xmath61 = 6.6 km s@xmath37 and 7.4 km s@xmath37 .",
    "the 6.6 km s@xmath37 component with a stronger peak is detected at the same lsr velocity where the other molecular lines are also detected , and most probably traces the same cloud core component as that traced by the other molecular lines . by contrast , the other molecular lines are not detected at the lsr velocity where the 7.4 km s@xmath37 component is detected .",
    "the absence of the other molecular lines is not due to chemistry because even the c@xmath62o ( 10 ) line does not show emission at this lsr velocity @xcite , suggesting that the 7.4 km s@xmath37 component probably traces a more diffuse cloud component .",
    "l1521f is located in the western part of the l1521 molecular complex , where the eastern edge of the redshifted ( 7 - 9 km s@xmath37 ) molecular filament extending from the b213 and l1495 molecular complex overlaps @xcite .",
    "the 7.4 km s@xmath37 component probably arises from this redshifted molecular filament .",
    "figure [ l15mom0 ] shows total integrated intensity maps of the c@xmath0h@xmath5 ( 2@xmath61@xmath7 ) , hcs@xmath35 ( 21 ) , hc@xmath62o@xmath35 ( 10 ) , ch@xmath0cch ( 5@xmath14@xmath1 ) , c@xmath2h ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) , and the @xmath8co ( 10 ) lines in l1521f .",

    "while the @xmath8co ( 10 ) emission line shows an almost featureless distribution , other emission lines show more complicated distributions . in this subsection ,",
    "the spatial distributions of those emission lines showing more complicated features are discussed first , and then the distribution of the @xmath8co ( 10 ) emission line .",
    "a common feature of the c@xmath0h@xmath5 , hcs@xmath35 , hc@xmath62o@xmath35 , ch@xmath0cch , and the c@xmath2h maps is that there is no emission peak at the position of l1521f - irs .",
    "in fact , the ch@xmath0cch ( 5@xmath14@xmath1 ) , c@xmath2h ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) , and the hcs@xmath35 ( 21 ) lines show local emission minima close to the protostellar position . on the other hand , detailed comparison among the different molecular lines shows that their spatial distributions are different from each other . for example , the c@xmath0h@xmath5 ( 2@xmath61@xmath7 ) line shows the highest peak at ( -30@xmath29 , + 20@xmath29 ) , where there is no emission peak in the other molecular lines .",
    "although several emission peaks are seen in the ch@xmath0cch ( 5@xmath14@xmath1 ) and c@xmath2h ( @xmath3@xmath4 ) lines , their peak positions are different from each other .",
    "the distributions of the hcs@xmath35 and hc@xmath62o@xmath35 lines are also different from those of the carbon - chain lines .    in order to investigate the nature of the observed carbon - chain emission distributions in more detail , in figure [ hiroko ] we compare the ch@xmath0cch and c@xmath2h emission distributions to the ccs ( @xmath33 = 3@xmath52@xmath34 ) and n@xmath5h@xmath35 ( @xmath36 = 10 ) distributions observed by shinnaga et al .",
    "the spatial resolution of the ccs and n@xmath5h@xmath35 observations ( @xmath11 18@xmath29 ) is similar to that of our observations , allowing us to directly compare the spatial distribution of these molecular lines .",
    "the n@xmath5h@xmath35 emission shows a compact ( @xmath11 50@xmath29 @xmath21 30@xmath29 ) blob around the vello position , while the ccs emission shows a local minimum at the vello position .",

    "the exact peak positions of these carbon - chain emissions in l1521f , however , are different from each other . towards the position of the strongest northern ccs peak",
    "the ch@xmath0cch and c@xmath2h lines appear to show local emission minima , and there is neither a ch@xmath0cch nor a c@xmath2h counterpart to the south - eastern ccs peak . compared to these carbon - chain molecular emissions , the @xmath8co ( 10 ) emission shows a rather featureless distribution , which is also seen in the c@xmath62o ( 10 , 21 ) emission @xcite . from the c@xmath62o ( 10 ) and c@xmath65o ( 10 ) observations crapsi et al .",

    "emission is @xmath11 12 .",
    "the featureless emission distribution in the @xmath8co ( 10 ) line is probably due to this high optical depth .",
    "although near - infrared observations of l1521f with spitzer found a bipolar nebulosity oriented along the east - west direction ( p.a .",

    "we note that both l1521f - irs and iram 04191 are associated with intense and extended ( @xmath12 4000 au ) dust - continuum emission , and that the amount of molecular gas derived from the dust - continuum emissions around these sources is similar @xcite .",
    "hence , these weak carbon - chain molecular emissions in iram 04191 are mostly likely due to the lower abundances of these molecules as will be discussed in @xmath663.3 . on the other hand , the peak total integrated intensity of the hc@xmath62o@xmath35 ( 10 ) emission in iram 04191 is more than twice as high as that in l1521f .",
    "two hc@xmath62o@xmath35 emission peaks are seen to the south - east and south - west of the protostar with a local minimum at the protostellar position .",
    "the distribution of the c@xmath0h@xmath5 emission in iram 04191 observed with the 45 m telescope is consistent with the earlier result observed with the iram 30 m telescope @xcite .",
    "the emission shows a peak close to the protostar , and an elongated feature along the north - west to the south - east direction , which is approximately perpendicular to the direction of the associated outflow @xcite .",
    "this elongated structure most likely traces the circumstellar envelope around the protostar , also seen in other molecular lines such as n@xmath5h@xmath35 ( 10 ) @xcite , c@xmath67s ( 21 ) and ch@xmath0oh ( 21 ) @xcite .",

    "( @xmath40 10@xmath13 yr ) carbon is mainly in the form of c@xmath35 and c , and at late evolutionary stages ( @xmath12 10@xmath13 yr ) almost all carbon is in the form of co. carbon - chain molecules are produced through hydrogenation of c@xmath35 and c , and hence are more abundant in the earlier evolutionary stage . on the other hand ,",
    "hco@xmath35 is formed via co + h@xmath91 , and hc@xmath62o@xmath35 is more abundant at later evolutionary phases .",
    "thus , the higher abundances of the carbon - chain molecules in l1521f than in iram 04191 , as well as the sightly higher hc@xmath62o@xmath35 abundance in iram 04191 than in l1521f , are likely to indicate that iram 04191 is chemically more evolved than l1521f .",
    "this chemical evolutionary difference is also consistent with the different outflow activity between l1521f - irs and iram 04191 ; there is a well - developed co molecular outflow in iram 04191 , as seen in figure [ i04mom0 ] , while no clear co molecular outflow is observed in l1521f - irs , suggesting that the star - forming activity is more advanced in iram 04191 than l1521f - irs .",
    "aikawa et al . ( 2001 , 2003 , 2005 ) theoretically studied the evolution of molecular distributions in collapsing dense cores .",
    "their model shows that the radial distribution of molecules varies as a function of the evolutionary time , and that the distribution of carbon - chain molecules such as ccs first shows a central hole after @xmath11 10@xmath31 yr ( with @xmath41 = 1.1 , where @xmath41 denotes the internal gravity - to - pressure ratio in the collapsing dense core . ) .",
    "this is because at the center the gas density is higher than that at the outer part , and hence the chemical evolution proceeds faster than that at the outer part . on the other hand ``",
    "late - type '' molecules such as co , hco@xmath35 , and n@xmath5h@xmath35 show centrally - peaked column density profiles in the early evolutionary stage , and then co and hco@xmath35 start to show central holes due to the depletion onto grain surfaces ( @xmath12 10@xmath31 yr ) .",
    "eventually , n@xmath5h@xmath35 also becomes depleted @xcite . in l1521f , the ch@xmath0cch , c@xmath2h , and the ccs emissions",
    "do not show a centrally - peaked spatial distribution but the n@xmath5h@xmath35 emission shows a centrally - peaked distribution ( see figure [ hiroko ] ) . on the other hand , in iram 04191",

    "comparison between the theoretical model and these observational results implies that in l1521f carbon - chain molecules are still abundant but at the center , they become less abundant due to the faster gas - phase chemical evolution , while in iram 04191 these carbon - chain molecules become undetectable and the depletion of n@xmath5h@xmath35 proceeds at the center .      in @xmath664.1 .",
    ", we have discussed the possibility that l1521f - irs is in an earlier evolutionary stage than iram 04191 .",
    "it is interesting to then compare the evolutionary stage of the surrounding dense gas around l1521f - irs and iram 04191 to that of starless dense cores in taurus . in table 4",
    ", we compiled several evolutionary indicators of three starless cores ( l1521b , l1498 , and l1544 ) and dense cores around the two vellos ( l1521f and iram 04191 ) .",
    "the evolutionary indicators include the ratio between the n@xmath5h@xmath35 and ccs column densities , the deuterium fractionation measured from the n@xmath5d@xmath35 / n@xmath5h@xmath35 column density ratio , the co depletion factor defined by crapsi et al .",

    ", the ratio between the n@xmath5h@xmath35 and ccs column densities is an excellent indicator of the gas - phase chemical evolution in dense cores , and the ratio increases as the dense core evolves .",
    "the deuterium fractionation and the co depletion factor are measures of chemical evolution of cold dense gas . under the cold gas ( @xmath40 10 k ) condition the deuterium fractionation proceeds due to preferable condition for the reaction of h@xmath91 + hd @xmath92 h@xmath5d@xmath35 + h@xmath5 , and co molecules keep depleting onto grain surfaces @xcite .",
    "the central gas density is a direct measure of the physical evolutionary stage of dense cores .",
    "table 4 shows that the collected dense cores can be sorted following these evolutional criteria . in l1521b and",
    "l1498 the n@xmath5h@xmath35 to ccs ratio , the deuterium fractionation , the co depletion factor , and the central gas density are lower than those in l1521f and iram 04191 .",
    "the co depletion factor and the central gas density in l1521f are similar to those in l1544 , another starless core in taurus @xcite , but the deuterium fractionation is twice as high as in l1544 than in l1521f .",
    "these results imply that l1544 is in a similar evolutionary stage as l1521f .",
    "in fact , towards l1544 an infalling gas motion has been observed @xcite , suggesting the core is in the process of protostellar formation , though inspection of the spitzer data in l1544 does not reveal any protostellar candidate @xcite .",
    "iram 04191 shows a higher n@xmath5h@xmath35 to ccs ratio , and co depletion factor , and lower carbon - chain abundances than l1521f , and iram 04191 is probably more evolved than l1521f as already discussed .      once a protostar forms at the center of the dense core , heating from the protostar desorbs molecules from grain surfaces and alters the chemical conditions .",
    "aikawa et al .

    "one is that both l1521f - irs and iram 04191 are protostars and the mass ejection event of l1521f - irs has started more recently than iram 04191 , and hence the amount of the molecular material entrained by l1521f - irs is lower than that by iram 04191 .",

    "the lower mass accretion rate towards l1521f - irs could yield the lower total outflow mass and the lower internal luminosity as compared to those of iram 04191 .",
    "the other possible interpretation is that l1521f - irs is a very low - mass , more evolved star close to the end of the mass accretion and ejection phase , and that the amount of the total mass of the molecular outflow is proportional to the amount of the total accreted material , and hence the central stellar mass . in this case",
    ", there may be a substantial difference in the central stellar mass between l1521f - irs and iram 04191 , and the most of the luminosity of l1521f - irs may originate from nuclear burning whereas the luminosity of iram 04191 originate mostly from mass accretion @xcite . in this case",
    ", how can we explain the observed chemical difference of the surrounding dense gas between l1521f and iram 04191 ?",
