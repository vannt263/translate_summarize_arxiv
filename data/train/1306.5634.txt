    "the absolute temperature @xmath4 is in usual physics bound to be a positive quantity . under special conditions , however , such as when high - energy states are more occupied than low - energy states , the temperature calculated from the thermodynamical formula @xmath5 can be a negative quantity .",
    "a striking example of this kind of system has recently been found experimentally , in the form of an attractively interacting ensemble of ultracold bosons ; cf .",
    "@xcite .",
    "this is , however , not the first example of a negative - temperature system . thus negative temperatures are associated with the properties of paramagnetic dielectrics ; cf . for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite , a key factor being here that the `` magnetic spectrum '' has to lie within a finite interval of energy .",
    "it is to be observed generally that the region of negative temperatures lies not `` below absolute zero '' but rather `` above infinity '' , implying that negative temperatures are in some sense `` higher '' than positive ones .",
    "an interesting idea suggested by @xcite is that the negative - temperature model may be helpful for the construction of a theory of dark energy in cosmology .",
    "as is commonly accepted by now , the expansion of the universe is a product of a positive tensile stress , or negative pressure , that the cosmic fluid displays .",
    "in which ways would it seem natural to generalize the standard cosmological theory ?",
    "one possibility might be to allow for a composition of two , or more , components in the cosmic fluid .",
    "thus the idea of considering the fluid as a mixture of two components , one ordinary fluid component and one dark energy component , has received substantial interest ; cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite and @xcite . the line of approach in the present note will however be different , namely to allow for _ negative bulk viscosities _ in the cosmic fluid .",
    "we shall consider the fluid as a one - component one .",
    "that means , we focus attention on the dark energy component only . in the real universe",
    "there may be a composition , as already mentioned , of a dark energy component and one or more other components , corresponding to normal fluids and perhaps also dark matter fluids .    at first sight",
    "the possibility @xmath6 might seem unreasonable , but one has to recall here that the positivity of @xmath7 relies upon the physical requirement that the time development of entropy in a non - equilibrium system is a positive quantity . and that is just the condition that we wish to relax .",
    "moreover , the characteristic property of the dark energy fluid implying that the parameter @xmath0 occurring in the equation of state , @xmath8 is less than @xmath1 , is a counterintuitive property of the same kind .",
    "so , we think that the possibility of allowing for negative values of @xmath7 is not so unreasonable after all , in view of the general bizarre properties of the dark energy fluid .",
    "as we will show in the next section , the reversal of the sign of @xmath7 implies in a natural way that the entropy of the fluid decreases with time .",
    "thus we are discussing a viscosity - induced , rather than a temperature- induced , violation of the conventional second law in thermodynamics .",
    "further examples of universe models with negative bulk viscosity are investigated in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "while positive viscosity accelerates the expansion of the universe , negative viscosity will in general decrease it .    in the summary section ,",
    "section 6 , we trace out some connections with other lines of approach investigated in contemporary cosmology . whereas we keep @xmath4 positive and find the entropy change with respect to time to be negative , there are other approaches in which @xmath4 is negative and the corresponding entropy change positive . in some sense",
    "there is an equivalence .",
    "it is instructive to start from nonrelativistic theory .",
    "let @xmath9 denote the components of the fluid velocity .",
    "the entropy density is @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the particle ( baryon ) density and @xmath12 the entropy per particle ( we use geometric units ) .",
    "then , if @xmath13 denotes the shear viscosity and @xmath7 as before the bulk viscosity , we have @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 is the thermal conductivity ; @xmath7 ( as well as @xmath13 and @xmath16 ) are positive quantities in the conventional theory",
    ".    this expression can readily be generalized into a relativistic language .",
    "we here need some definitions .",
    "let @xmath17 be the four - velocity of the fluid ; in comoving coordinates @xmath18 .",
    "if @xmath19 is the general metric , the projection tensor is @xmath20 the rotation tensor is @xmath21 } , \\label{5}\\ ] ] the expansion tensor is @xmath22 and finally the shear tensor is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the scalar expansion .    with the spacelike heat flux density vector defined as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the four - acceleration , we can now make the effective substitutions @xmath27 whereby @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the entropy current four - vector @xmath30 ( the sketchy derivation above follows @xcite ; more complete treatments can be found in @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "assume now spatial isotropy , implying @xmath31 , and assume that there is no heat flux , @xmath32 .",
    "then @xmath33 we consider henceforth the spatially flat frw spacetime , with metric @xmath34 implying that @xmath35 with @xmath36 the hubble parameter . as @xmath37 in the local rest frame",
    ", we have @xmath38 thus , if @xmath4 still means the conventional positive temperature in the cosmic fluid , one gets @xmath39 if @xmath6 .",
    "the specific entropy @xmath12 has to decrease with increasing time in this model .",
    "a more detailed insight into the physics of this model can be achieved by considering the behavior near the phantom divide more closely .",
    "this divide is defined as the case @xmath2 . as is known from observations @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 lies close to @xmath1 today : @xmath40 a characteristic property of most of the phantom dark energy models is the occurrence of the big rip future singularity : once the phantom divide is crossed so as to give @xmath41 , the universe is inevitably driven into a singularity ( the scale factor becoming infinity ) at a finite time in the future .",
    "this was first observed by @xcite , and has later been re - examined by a number of researchers ( for a recent review including also modified gravity , see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "these early theories assumed the cosmic fluid to be nonviscous .",
    "once bulk viscosity is included , the theory becomes richer and more flexible .",
    "one important property , on which we shall focus attention in the following , is that on the basis of a conventional positive value of @xmath7 it becomes possible for the fluid to slide from the quintessence region ( @xmath42 ) through the phantom divide into the phantom region and thus afterwards into the future singularity .",
    "this was first pointed out in @xcite . whether a transition through the `` point '' @xmath2 really occurs or not , depends on the magnitude of @xmath7 .",
    "consider now the friedmann equations for the flat space , @xmath43 @xmath44 together with the conservation equation for energy , @xmath45 they provide a set of equations enabling us to derive the governing equation for the scalar expansion , or equivalently , for the energy density .",
    "imagine first the general case for which @xmath46 .",
    "then , if the function @xmath47 is defined via @xmath48 we can write the governing equation for @xmath49 in the form @xmath50 which has the solution @xmath51}. \\label{21}\\ ] ] here we have taken @xmath52 as the initial point , @xmath53 meaning @xmath54 .    we limit ourselves in the following to the case when @xmath55 , with @xmath56 a constant .",
    "thus @xmath57 we next need to model the form of the bulk viscosity .",
    "probably the most interesting form from a physical point of view is to put the viscosity proportional to the scalar expansion . therewith we allow for an increase of the viscosity in the case of increasingly vigorous movements in the cosmic fluid .",
    "let us assume that @xmath58 with @xmath59 a constant .",
    "this choice has been analyzed repeatedly also before ; cf .",
    ", for instance , @xcite . equation ( [ 21 ] ) then yields @xmath60 this shows that the fate of the universe is critically dependent of the sign of the prefactor .",
    "the condition for a big rip @xmath61 to occur , is that @xmath62 in conventional viscous cosmology , as explored in @xcite , even if the universe starts from a state lying in the quintessence region @xmath63 , it is possible for the fluid to slide through the phantom divide into the phantom region if the viscosity is big enough @xmath64 in this case ) .",
    "once having entered the phantom region , the big rip in one of its variants becomes inevitable .    in the present case , however , with @xmath65 ,",
    "the situation becomes reversed . even if the fluid starts within the phantom region @xmath66 it is possible , if the negative viscosity becomes large enough in magnitude , to abandon the singularity by making the expression on the left hand side of ( [ 25 ] ) negative .",
    "the fluid goes back to the quintessence region @xmath67 , and becomes thus infinitely thinned in the far future , @xmath68 .",
    "the role of the phantom divide as a kind of a one - way `` membrane '' is in this way no longer upheld .",
    "we here use the results of @xcite , but allow for the possibility that the bulk viscosity is negative .",
    "let us first consider a flat universe model with dust , and live in which the interaction of the dust and the vacuum energy with stress and thus with negative absolute temperature , is modeled by negative viscosity .",
    "the raychaudhury equation may then be written @xmath69 where @xmath70 is einstein s gravitational constant and @xmath71 is the density of the lorentz invariant vacuum energy , live , which is constant and may be represented by the cosmological constant .",
    "we shall first consider the case where the bulk viscosity is constant and negative , @xmath72 .",
    "then the general solution of this equation with @xmath73 and @xmath74 may be written    [ 27 ] @xmath75    [ 28 ] @xmath76}\\sinh^{\\frac{2}{3 } } \\left ( \\frac{3}{2}\\alpha t\\right),\\\\ \\beta&=&\\left[\\frac{\\rho_{m0}-3h_0\\zeta_0}{\\rho_\\lambda+(3/4)\\kappa \\zeta_0 ^ 2}\\right]^{1/3},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath77 is the present density of cold dark energy which has been assumed to be pressure less dust , and @xmath78 is the present value of the hubble parameter .",
    "note that the value of @xmath56 is independent of the sign of @xmath79 .",
    "the hubble parameter has an infinitely large initial value and decreases towards @xmath80 , which is positive for all values of @xmath79 .",
    "it is seen that when @xmath79 is constant the sign of @xmath79 does change the behavior of the universe qualitatively .",
    "the age of the universe is @xmath81 showing that negative viscosity makes the age smaller .",
    "we shall then consider the case where the bulk viscosity is proportional to the hubble parameter with a negative constant of proportionality , @xmath82 .",
    "in this case the raychaudhuri equation takes the form @xmath83 solving this equation with the boundary condition that @xmath84 gives    [ 31 ] @xmath85    the scale factor is @xmath86^{\\frac{2}{3(1-\\kappa \\zeta_1)}}. \\label{32}\\ ] ] the age of this universe model is @xmath87 in the present case the age - redshift relationship , i.e. the relationship between the time @xmath88 of emission and the time @xmath89 of observation of radiation with redshift @xmath90 is @xmath91 } { { \\rm arctanh } \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega_{\\lambda 0}}{1-\\kappa \\zeta_1}}}. \\label{33a}\\ ] ] the corresponding expression for the standard universe model without viscosity @xcite is obtained by putting @xmath92    for this universe model the equation of continuity takes the form @xmath93 inserting the expression ( [ 31 ] ) for @xmath36 we find that eq .",
    "( [ 34 ] ) has the general solution @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "note that @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "hence there exists an instant @xmath100 where the density of the dust vanishes , after which this model is no more physically realistic .",
    "the equation @xmath101 leads to @xmath102 the scale factor and the hubble parameter at this instant are @xmath103 @xmath104 here there is no singularity at the instant @xmath100 , only a transition to an unphysical state with negative mass density .",
    "we shall here consider some viscous universe models that have been studied earlier with positive bulk viscosity , and investigate how their physical properties become changed when the viscosity changes sign .    if the vacuum energy is removed in the universe model described by eqs .",
    "( [ 27 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) , and the fluid is assumed to obey an equation of state @xmath105 with constant value of @xmath0 , the scale factor with @xmath106 is given by @xcite    [ 39 ] @xmath107    hence with @xmath108 this universe model will eventually reach a viscosity dominated steady state era with exponential expansion and @xmath109 , but when @xmath110 the effect of the viscosity upon the expansion of the universe diminishes , and the universe model has a finite final value of the scale factor , @xmath111 .    some years ago , @xcite considered a class of viscous universe models dominated by a viscous fluid with @xmath105 and bulk viscosity @xmath112 where @xmath113 is constant .",
    "then the rate of change of the hubble parameter is @xmath114 the solution of this equation with @xmath115 is given by the equation    [ 41 ] @xmath116    on the other hand inserting @xmath117 in the last factor of eq .",
    "( [ 40 ] ) and then integrating with the same boundary conditions we obtain @xmath118 comparison between eqs .",
    "( [ 41 ] ) and ( [ 42 ] ) gives @xmath119 for positive viscosity ( @xmath120 ) these equations describe an expanding universe model , but for negative viscosity ( @xmath121 ) the hubble parameter must be negative for the scale factor to be positive . hence the universe model contracts .",
    "as an example of anisotropic universe models we shall finally consider the effect of negative viscosity of some simple universe models of bianchi type i. the line element has the form @xmath122 the directional hubble parameters are @xmath123 , and the anisotropy parameter is    [ 45 ] @xmath124    in a universe filled with live with constant density @xmath71 we have ; cf .",
    "@xcite @xmath125 if @xmath126 and in the case of a relativistically rigid fluid with @xmath127 ( a so - called zeldovich fluid ) , with constant bulk viscosity @xmath7 , the anisotropy parameter as a function of time is @xmath128 hence , a positive viscosity leads to decay of the anisotropy , while a negative viscosity increases the anisotropy .",
    "this is a characteristic behavior for more general viscous anisotropic universe models . including live the hubble parameter is @xmath129 it is seen that the sign of the viscosity does not influence @xmath130 , but the average hubble factor @xmath36 is smaller with negative viscosity than with a positive one .",
    "negative viscosity acts like a decelerating force upon the expansion of the universe .",
    "our purpose in this paper has been to investigate situations in cosmology where the entropy decreases with increasing time .",
    "specifically , we have achieved this by taking the bulk viscosity @xmath7 to be less than zero ( in accordance with spatial isotropy , the shear viscosity has been put equal to zero ) .",
    "the ansatz @xmath6 is of course counterintuitive , but one should here note that the positivity of @xmath7 in conventional cosmology is based upon the requirement that the change of entropy in a non - equilibrium system is positive , and that is just the property that we wish to relax .",
    "one may also observe the analogy with the phantom era in the expansion of the universe , meaning that the parameter @xmath0 in the equation of state @xmath105 is less that @xmath1 . in both cases ,",
    "bizarre thermodynamic behaviors are encountered .",
    "we have shown that in a generalization of the @xmath3cdm universe model with negative bulk viscosity , the viscosity contributes with an attractive gravity , and hence tends to decrease the expansion .",
    "it turns out that in a model where the negative coefficient of bulk viscosity is proportional to the density of the fluid , expansion is not allowed .",
    "therefore , after all , even if negative viscosity is a theoretical possibility , it does not seem to be a favored property of the cosmic fluid .",
    "@xmath131 our formalism allows for the presence of a negative bulk viscosity @xmath7 but keeps the temperature @xmath4 positive .",
    "we emphasize that the entropy four - vector ( [ 11 ] ) does not depend upon the sign of @xmath7 at all .",
    "what changes sign with @xmath7 , is the _ change _ of entropy with time ; cf .",
    "( [ 10 ] ) .",
    "@xmath131 in many cases , the inclusion of bulk viscosity in cosmological theory does not lead to significant changes . for instance , the cardy - verlinde formula for entropy , cf .",
    "@xcite , has been found to apply under various conditions in the presence of viscosity , even in the case of a multicomponent fluid obeying an inhomogeneous equation of state ; cf .",
    "@xcite . a somewhat stronger influence from cosmology",
    "is experienced , as mentioned above , in cases where the viscosity is large enough to make the fluid pass through the phantom barrier @xmath2 into the phantom regime ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath131 in other cases , when dealing with dark energy , one expects that the the entropy itself can be negative .",
    "thus , @xcite considered the effect of a dark energy ideal fluid by inserting an inhomogeneous hubble - parameter dependent term in the late - time universe .",
    "remarkably enough , a thermodynamical dark energy model was found in which , despite preliminary expectations ( @xcite ) , the entropy of the phantom epoch could be positive .",
    "this was caused by crossing of the phantom barrier .",
    "theories of this kind are wider in scope , and generally different from , the one presented by us above .",
