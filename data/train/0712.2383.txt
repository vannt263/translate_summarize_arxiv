    "the search for a mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking , and in particular for a standard model ( sm ) higgs boson has been a major goal of high energy physics for many years , and is a central part of fermilab s tevatron program . both cdf and have recently reported searches for the sm higgs boson that combined different production and decay modes  @xcite . in this note , we combine the most recent results of all such searches in  collisions at  . the searches for a sm higgs boson produced in association with vector bosons ( ,  or ) or singly through gluon - gluon fusion ( ) , in data corresponding to integrated luminosities ranging from 1.0 - 1.9  at cdf and 0.9 - 1.7  at d .",
    "to simplify their combination , the searches are separated into nineteen mutually exclusive final states ( eight for cdf , eleven for d , see table  [ tab : cdfacc ] and  [ tab : dzacc ] ) referred to as `` analyses '' in this note .",
    "selection procedures for each analysis are detailed in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite , and are briefly described below .",
    "event selections are similar for the corresponding cdf and d  analyses . for the case of , an isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) and two jets are required , with one or more @xmath4-tagged jet , i.e. identified as originating from a @xmath4-quark .",
    "selected events must also display a significant imbalance in transverse momentum ( referred to as missing transverse energy or ) .",
    "events with more than one isolated lepton are vetoed .",
    "for the d  analyses , two non - overlapping @xmath4-tagged samples are defined , one being a single `` tight '' @xmath4-tag ( st ) sample , and the other a double `` loose '' @xmath4-tag ( dt ) sample .",
    "the tight and loose @xmath4-tagging criteria are defined with respect to the mis - identification rate that the @xmath4-tagging algorithm yields for light quark jets ( `` mistag rate '' ) typically @xmath5 or @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "for the cdf  analyses , an analysis based on a sample with two tight b - tags ( tdt ) is combined with an analysis based on a non - overlapping sample requiring one tight b - tag and one loose b - tag ( ldt ) . in the  analyses , both cdf and d",
    "use neural - network ( nn ) discriminants as the final variables for setting limits .",
    "the networks are optimized to discriminate signal from background at each value of the higgs boson mass ( the `` test mass '' ) under study .    for the  analyses ,",
    "the selection is similar to the @xmath7 selection , except all events with isolated leptons are vetoed and stronger multijet background suppression techniques are applied .",
    "the cdf analysis uses non - overlapping samples of events , one with one tight @xmath4-tag and one with two loose @xmath4-tags , while duses a sample of events having one tight @xmath4-tag jet and one loose @xmath4-tag jet .",
    "as there is a sizable fraction of  signal in which the lepton is undetected , that is selected in the  samples , this fraction is included as part of the acceptance of the  search . in the  analyses , cdf uses the dijet invariant mass as the final discriminant variable , while d   uses a neural - network discriminant .",
    "the  analyses require two isolated leptons and at least two jets .",
    "they use non - overlapping samples of events with one tight @xmath4-tag and two loose @xmath4-tags . for the d  analysis",
    "a neural - network discriminant is the final variable for setting limits , while cdf uses the output of a 2-dimensional neural - network .    for the  analyses , a large  and two opposite - signed , isolated leptons ( any combination of electrons or muons ) are selected , defining three final states ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 ) for d .",
    "cdf separates the  events in two non - overlapping samples , one having a low signal / bacgkround ratio , the other having a higher one .",
    "the presence of neutrinos in the final state prevents reconstruction of the higgs mass , and the final discriminants are neural - network outputs for d  and likelihoods constructed from matrix - element probabilities for cdf .",
    "the d  experiment also contributes three  analyses , where the associated @xmath11 boson and the @xmath11 boson from the higgs decay which has the same charge are required to decay leptonically , thereby defining three like - sign dilepton final states ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 ) containing all decays of the third @xmath11 boson . in this analysis ,",
    "the final variable is a likelihood discriminant formed from several topological variables .",
    "all higgs signals are simulated using pythia v6.202  @xcite , and cteq5l  @xcite leading - order ( lo ) parton distribution functions .",
    "the signal cross sections are normalized to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculations  @xcite , and branching ratios from hdecay  @xcite . for both cdf and d , events from multijet ( instrumental ) backgrounds ( `` qcd production '' )",
    "are measured in data with different methods , except for the cdf  analysis in which heavy flavor qcd backgrounds are estimated using a pythia simulation . for cdf ,",
    "backgrounds from other sm processes were generated using pythia , alpgen  @xcite , and herwig  @xcite programs .",
    "for d , these backgrounds were generated using pythia , alpgen , and comphep  @xcite , with pythia providing parton - showering and hadronization for all the generators .",
    "background processes were normalized using either experimental data or next - to - leading order calculations from mcfm  @xcite .",

    "upper limits on the ratios to the sm cross section , as functions of the higgs test mass , for the combined cdf and d  analyses .",
