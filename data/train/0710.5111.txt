    "bhabha scattering is one of the theoretically best studied scattering processes at @xmath4 colliders and can also be measured with a high precision .",
    "the accuracy of the monte - carlo programs developed originally for physics at lep is about @xmath5 , and with a complete two - loop calculation one may reach @xmath6 .",
    "the latter number is indicative of efforts for the international linear collider ( ilc ) , here especially in the gigaz option running at the @xmath7 boson resonance , but also for meson factories running at much smaller energies of about 1 or 10 gev .",
    "recent years brought considerable progress in the determination of the virtual nnlo corrections .",
    "the virtual @xmath8 contributions to the massless differential bhabha cross section have been determined in @xcite . shortly after , this result was used for deriving the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) corrections to massive bhabha scattering in @xcite .",
    "the missing photonic correction terms of order @xmath11 were derived , also from @xcite , in @xcite .",
    "the virtual corrections from fermion loop insertions , including the corresponding double - box diagrams , could not be covered by that method . for @xmath12 , the case of only electron loops ,",
    "the corresponding diagrams were evaluated analytically in @xcite , and the net @xmath12 cross section in @xcite . at this stage the numerically most important two - loop corrections were known . for a complete treatment one needs additionally the @xmath13 two - loop corrections with heavy fermion insertions , including the hadronic corrections which replace the loop insertions from light quarks .",
    "the leptonic @xmath13 contributions have been derived quite recently in two papers in the limit @xmath14 ; with a direct feynman diagram calculation in @xcite , and using a factorization formula that relates massless and massive amplitudes in @xcite ( for that method see also @xcite ) .",
    "it might be interesting to mention that the original expectations on the necessity of a complete , direct two - loop massive feynman diagram evaluation were not fulfilled .",
    "after the analytical evaluation of a massive planar and a massive non - planar double - box diagram ( both with seven propagators ) in @xcite and in @xcite , resp . , there was hope to evaluate all the remaining diagrams soon .",
    "there are 33 two - loop box master integrals , nine of them with seven lines @xcite .",
    "in fact , from recent studies on the exact and mass expanded treatment of two - loop box master integrals in @xcite and @xcite , resp .",
    ", it became clear that an evaluation of all the massive master integrals is a more complicated task than was expected .",
    "quite recently , the case of non - planar master integrals was successfully treated in another , but related context @xcite .",
    "proceeding similarly for bhabha scattering seems feasible now . as a matter of fact , due to these reasons",
    ", the direct feynman diagram approach was not used for the phenomenologically needed two - loop predictions and the above - mentioned papers @xcite-@xcite remained so far a mere interesting , challenging theoretical development .    in this paper , we report on the evaluation of the leptonic @xmath13 two - loop contributions with _ arbitrary mass _ of the heavier fermion , exploring the extended kinematical region @xmath15 .",
    "we use the dispersion approach , so that our formulae may be applied without further modification also to hadronic corrections . for a review on the status of monte - carlo studies for bhabha scattering at this conference",
    "we refer to @xcite , and for a discussion on progress related to radiative loop corrections to @xcite .",
    "the classes of two - loop @xmath13 corrections are shown in figure [ fig - nf2 ] .",
    "classes of two - loop diagrams for bhabha scattering containing at least one fermion loop . ]    the four direct and four crossed fermionic two - loop box diagrams , obtained applying proper permutations to the sample diagram shown in figure [ fig - nf2 ] , are infrared ( ir ) divergent , and they have to be combined with other ir - divergent factorizable corrections in order to get an ir - finite contribution to the cross section . in particular , we have to add the interference of two - loop box ( class @xmath16 ) and reducible vertex diagrams ( class @xmath17 ) with the tree - level amplitude to the interference of one - loop vertex and box diagrams with one - loop vacuum polarization diagrams .",
    "finally , we construct an ir - finite quantity taking into account also the real emission of one soft photon from one - loop vacuum polarization diagrams .",

    "being the box diagrams ir divergent , and showing poles in @xmath41 , one should take into account higher orders in @xmath41 for @xmath42 .",
    "however , after assembling box diagrams with factorizable corrections , ir poles cancel and @xmath42 can be evaluated at order @xmath43 .",
