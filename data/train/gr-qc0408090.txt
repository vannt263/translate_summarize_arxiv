    "the evolution of field perturbation around a black hole consists roughly of three stages @xcite .",

    "and the last one is a power - law tail behavior of the waves at very late time .",
    "the late - time evolution of various field perturbations outside a black hole has important implications for two major aspects of black - hole physics : the no - hair theorem and the mass - inflation scenario@xcite@xcite .",

    "koyama and tomimatsu @xcite found that the very late - time tail of the massive scalar field in the schwarzschild and rn background is approximately given by  @xmath6 .    although much attention has been paid to the investigations of the late - time behaviors of the neutral scalar , gravitational and electromagnetic fields in the static and stationary spacetimes , at the moment the study of the late - time tail evolution of the charged massive fields is still an open question .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study the late - time tail evolution of the charged massive dirac fields in the rn black - hole background .",
