    "there is now strongly compelling evidence that planetary companions to main sequence stars are found preferentially around metal - rich stars .",
    "@xcite was the first to do a detailed comparison of the chemical abundances of stars with and without planets , and to conclude that there was a significant difference in these samples .",
    "this finding has subsequently been supported by a large number of investigations , several of which included carefully selected control samples ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "much of the early work in this area concentrated on determining the direction of causality in the observed correlation .",
    "that is , does the presence of planets pollute the stellar convective region causing an apparent increase in photospheric metallicity , or does the physics of planet formation significantly favor a metal - rich environment ?",
    "this issue has been addressed by searching for patterns of elemental enhancement in planet - host stellar photospheres that might result from the metal - rich ( or h- and he - poor ) detritus of planet formation .",
    "so far , there is little compelling evidence that post - formation stellar photospheric self - enrichment is responsible for the observed correlation ; a primordial explanation is most likely @xcite .",
    "thus , searching for planets around stars with relatively low metallicity is extremely important for our understanding of the physics of planet formation .",
    "we need to find the lowest metallicity stars around which planets are able to form .",
    "the radial - velocity survey of @xcite was the first to specifically target low metallicity stars in order to understand in detail the low-@xmath2 end of the dependence of planetary system and formation on metallicity .",
    "we present here the discovery of two planetary companions to the star hd155358 .",
    "this is one of the sample of low - metallicity stars that were included in our het planet survey @xcite in order to begin to explore the low - metallicity tail of the heavy element distribution of stars with planets .",

    "detailed parameters of the host star are given in section  [ stellar_properties ] , and the implications of this fascinating system for planet formation theories are given in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "all observations of hd155358 were made in queue scheduled mode using the high resolution spectrometer @xcite of the 9.2 m hobby - eberly telescope @xcite .",
    "a 400 optical fiber which subtends 20 on the sky tracks the star across the focal plane of the telescope .",
    "starlight then passes through a molecular iodine absorption cell stabilized at a temperature of 70c .",

    "the spectrum is recorded on a mosaic of two @xmath5 pixel e2v ccds , which samples the spectrum at @xmath6 pixels per resolution element .",
    "the cross - disperser is set to obtain the spectrum between 4076 and 7838 . a small gap between the two ccds falls at 5936 , allowing most of the i@xmath3 absorption spectrum to be recorded on the `` blue '' ccd chip .",
    "we obtained a total of 71 high signal / noise radial velocity observations of hd155358 between june 2001 and march 2007 .",
    "all spectra were processed using standard iraf routines , and velocities were computed using our high - precision radial velocity code .",

    "they also showed that the disk instability model has essentially no dependence on stellar metallicity , but would require a disk mass of at least 10 times the mmsn to form these planets .",
    "thus , the two giant planets we have discovered in the hd155358 system could have formed from either formation mechanism . in either model",
    "they require a disk which was substantially more massive than the minimum - mass solar nebula .",
    "@xcite investigated the dependence of the formation of planetary systems on stellar metallicity within the core - accretion model .",
    "the motivation for their model was to explain the observed correlation between high stellar metallicity and planetary systems easily detected by rv techniques .",
    "the basic idea is that in systems of high metallicity , the dust surface density in the protoplanetary disk will be enhanced .",
    "this will lead to planetary cores being formed on a much shorter timescale .",
    "@xcite derived a planetary core mass at time @xmath67 ( prior to depletion of the feeding zone ) that is proportional to @xmath68 , where @xmath2 is the stellar metallicity ( @xmath69_{\\star } } z_{\\sun}$ ] ) . for a giant planet to grow ,",
    "a core must achieve a mass above a critical value of about 10 - 20@xmath70 before the gas disk is dissipated . if the core does reach a super - critical mass while there is still significant gas content in the disk , it will rapidly accrete gas and grow to become a gas - giant planet .",
    "if the core remains sub - critical through gas disk dissipation , then the planetary core will remain a neptune or a super - earth . since the disk dissipation has a much weaker ( if any ) dependence on stellar metallicity ,",
    "gas - giant planet formation around low @xmath2 stars is significantly more difficult than around stars of solar or higher metallicity . unless the circumstellar disk is rather massive to begin with ,",
    "there simply is nt time to grow critical - mass cores before the gas disk dissipates .",
    "thus , one might expect a critical lower metallicity threshold for the formation of gas giant planets . the value of this threshold would depend on the physics governing the overall mass of the disk , which are poorly understood .",
    "the third relevant timescale for determining the final configuration of a planetary system is that of the planetary system dynamical evolution , which transforms the system from the one which formed the planets into the system which we detect today .",
    "there are two basic physical processes governing post - formation dynamical evolution .",
    "these are tidal migration prior to disk dissipation , and planet - planet or planet - planetessimal scattering following disk dissipation .",
    "only tidal migration can have any significant dependence on stellar metallicity .",
    "the disk evolution is driven by the disk viscosity . in type ii migration ,",
    "in which the planet has opened a gap in the disk as a result of depleting the local gas in the disk from runaway gas accretion , the planet is locked into the viscous evolution of the disk . @xcite give a disk migration timescale that depends linearly on the disk viscosity ,  @xmath71 .",
    "the dependence of @xmath71 on metallicity is not known , and most models assume a constant @xmath71 of order @xmath72 for all disks .",
    "thus , it appears that once a system of several planets is able to form in a disk , the subsequent dynamical evolution of that system is probably reasonably independent of  @xmath2 .",
    "detailed modeling of the dependence of disk evolution and type  ii migration on @xmath2 is needed .",
    "if the dynamical evolution of the planetary system is due to tidal migration in the disk , this migration must still occur before the disk is dissipated .",
    "if the final configuration of the hd155358 system is due to post - formation planet - planet scattering , or dynamical interactions of the planets with remnant planetessimals , then we would not necessarily expect any significant dependence of the process on the stellar metallicity . for low metallicity systems ,",
    "the theoretical challenge is to form the planets of the required mass before the disk dissipates .",
    "this material is based on work supported by the national aeronautics and space administration under grants nng04g141 g and nng05g107 g issued through the terrestrial planet finder foundation science program .",
    "the dynamical simulations used in this work were carried out at the texas advanced computing center ( tacc ) .",
    "the hobby - eberly telescope ( het ) is a joint project of the university of texas at austin , the pennsylvania state university , stanford university , ludwig - maximilians - universitt mnchen , and georg - august - universitt gttingen .",
