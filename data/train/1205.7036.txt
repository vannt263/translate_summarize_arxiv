    "low density parity check ( ldpc ) codes are classical error - correcting codes originally introduced by gallager @xcite .",
    "they come with highly efficient local iterative decoding schemes , have been extensively studied and have proved very successful on a number of channels .",
    "therefore , in the field of quantum communication and quantum computation , it is natural to look into the quantum analog of classical ldpc codes , which arguably are stabilizer codes with generators of bounded weight . we will call such codes low density stabilizer codes or , following others , refer to them somewhat loosely as quantum ldpc codes .",
    "these include a number of constructions of locally decodable quantum codes with a topological connection , starting with kitaev s celebrated toric code @xcite , and other families among which surfaces codes @xcite , @xcite , color codes @xcite , @xcite , and other variants @xcite , @xcite .",
    "various generalizations to the quantum setting of classical ldpc codes have also been proposed , e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we are interested in the performance of quantum ldpc codes over the quantum erasure channel .",
    "our motivation is inspired by the classical setting , in which the systematic study of ldpc codes for the classical erasure channel has led to a better understanding of the behaviour of ldpc codes for more complicated channels such as the binary symmetric channel and the gaussian channel .",
    "this approach has hardly been attempted in the quantum setting and it is not unreasonable to hope for similar returns in the long run . the quantum erasure channel , besides being simpler than the more universal depolarizing channel , is also a realistic channel @xcite .",
    "its capacity is known , it is @xmath4 @xcite , however almost nothing is known about the performance of quantum ldpc codes over this channel .",
    "we would like to gain some understanding as to what are the code characteristics needed to achieve capacity .",
    "we shall derive a bound on the achievable rate of stabilizer codes as a function of an upper bound on the weight of the generators of the stabilizer group .",
    "equivalently , we will derive an upper bound on the decoding threshold on the erasure channel for quantum ldpc codes .",
    "this bound will yield the following result : any family of stabilizer codes that have stabilizer groups with generators of weight bounded by a constant , can not achieve the capacity of the quantum erasure channel .",
    "this phenomenon is somewhat analogous to the classical setting @xcite @xcite where it is known that capacity achieving ldpc codes must have parity - check matrices with growing row weights .",
    "our result has an unexpected application to percolation theory .",
    "given an infinite edge - transitive graph , a random subgraph , called the _",
    "subgraph is considered where every edge is declared open , independently of the others , with probability @xmath5 .",
    "the central question in percolation theory is the determination of the critical probability @xmath6 , which is the minimum value of @xmath5 such that the open connected component of any given edge @xmath7 is infinite with non zero probability . for most graphs , computing the critical probability",
    "exactly is usually quite difficult .",
    "we are interested in the critical probability of graphs that make up regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane .",
    "the connection with quantum erasure correcting codes is that quotients of the infinite tiling of the hyperbolic plane yield finite graphs ( more precisely combinatorial surfaces ) that define quantum ldpc codes ( surface codes ) : selecting a random erasure pattern for the finite code is the same as selecting a random subgraph of the finite graph , and the non - correctable erasure event is very close to the percolation event on the infinite graph .",
    "this connection was observed for the toric code @xcite , and this is why the erasure threshold of the toric code coincides with the critical probability @xmath8 in the square lattice .",
    "we shall derive a bound on the erasure decoding threshold for surface codes that will lead to an upper bound on the critical probability @xmath6 for hyperbolic tilings . to the best of our knowledge",
    "this is the sharpest presently known such upper bound .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after introductory and background material presented in section  [ section : background ] , we derive an upper bound on achievable rates of stabilizer codes in section  [ section : stabilizer ] .",
    "there are two main results in this section .",
    "the first is theorem  [ theo : capacity_stabilizer ] which states that achievable rates of stabilizer codes satisfy a bound of the form @xmath9 for a non - negative function @xmath2 .",
    "this enables one to recover the capacity bound @xmath10 for the quantum erasure channel for the particular case of stabilizer codes .",
    "it also enables one to derive improved bounds on achievable rates for particular classes of stabilizer codes .",
    "we derive such an improved bound in theorem  [ theo : stabilizer ] for stabilizer codes with generators of bounded weight . in section  [ section : css(2,m ) ] we refine the above bound for a particular class of ldpc css codes that make up a family of surface codes . in section  [ section : percolation ] we apply the refined bound on achievable rates to percolation on hyperbolic lattices : the main result is theorem  [ theo : percolation_bound_ldpc ] which is an upper bound on critical probabilities . finally , an appendix regroups some technicalities necessary to complete formal proofs ( appendix  [ appendix : concavity_inequality ] ) .",

    "it is defined as the set of fixed points of an abelian group of pauli operators .",

    "this material is quite well - known but we have felt the need to highlight the properties that we need , in particular because we shall make extensive use of linear algebra . for a more precise description of quantum information and quantum error - correcting codes ,",

    "denote by @xmath18 the identity matrix of size 2 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "these operators satisfy the following relations : @xmath22 the pauli group @xmath23 for one qubit is the group generated by the matrices : @xmath24 remark that two different non - identity pauli matrices always anti - commute .",
    "the pauli group @xmath25 on @xmath16 qubits is the multiplicative group of @xmath16-fold tensor products of errors of @xmath23 : @xmath26 the complex number @xmath27 is the phase of the pauli operator .",
    "an important consequence of this construction is the fact that two pauli errors either commute or anti - commute .",
    "more precisely , given two errors @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath25 , we have : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number of components @xmath32 such that @xmath33 and @xmath34 are two different non - identity pauli matrices .",
    "for example , the operators @xmath35 and @xmath36 in @xmath37 anti - commute because they anti - commute only in the second position .",
    "this fact is at the origin of syndrome measurement .",
    "a stabilizer group @xmath38 is a commutative subgroup of @xmath25 which does nt contain @xmath39 .",
    "a stabilizer group is generated by a family of commuting pauli operators : @xmath40 . without loss of generality",
    ", we can assume that these operators have phase 1 .",
    "this ensure us that @xmath39 is not in @xmath38 .",
    "given @xmath38 a stabilizer group of @xmath25 , the corresponding _ stabilizer code _ @xmath41 is defined as the set of fixed points of the subgroup @xmath38 in @xmath17 . using the physical ket notation for vectors",

    "it allows for the same decoding procedure to correct a large number of different errors .",

    "we obtain after some rearranging :    [ theo : percolation_bound_ldpc ] we have @xmath538 where @xmath5 is the smallest solution @xmath539 $ ] of the equation : @xmath540where @xmath541 and @xmath318 are the coefficients of the generating function @xmath332 .    using symbolic computation software , we can compute this bound on the critical probability .",

    "a generalization of this approach to the depolarizing channel would be very welcome .",
    "the difficulty is the fact that for depolarizing noise the probability of an error depends on its weight .",

    "the exact value of the critical probability of hyperbolic tilings remains unknown . to improve our upper bound , we must enumerate more connected components in the random graph , which becomes more difficult when we count components that are not subtrees .",
