    "dynamo action is generally believed to be at the origin of the magnetic field in most astrophysical objects .",
    "the conducting fluid which produces the magnetic field , is generally strongly turbulent ( @xmath3 ) with an extended inertial range .",
    "in addition as it is electrically conducting , the fluid is characterized by the magnetic prandtl number @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the fluid viscosity and magnetic diffusivity . in a liquid metal as in planetary cores or stellar convective zones @xmath7 , while in the warm interstellar medium , coronal and cluster plasmas @xmath2 @xcite . in direct numerical simulations",
    "both conditions , @xmath3 and @xmath0 much different from unity , are still out of reach of the present day computers .",
    "an alternative is to use shell models .",
    "hydrodynamical shell models are a rough approximation of the navier - stokes equations formulated on a discrete set of real wave numbers @xmath8 , corresponding to a fourier space divided into shells of logarithmic width @xmath9 .",
    "they involve ( complex ) scalar quantities reminiscent of the velocity fourier components of an isotropic flow .",
    "the model satisfies the conservation of both kinetic energy and kinetic helicity when the viscosity is set to zero .",
    "it leads to the resolution of a system of ordinary differential equations , requiring much less computing power than the direct numerical simulations of the original equations .",
    "it is then possible to run a shell model for realistic values of the viscosity such as @xmath10 ( for a review on shell models , see biferale ( 2003 ) and references therein ) .",
    "the results obtained with shell models are in general agreement with the kolmogorov phenomenology including intermittency @xcite . firstly at any scale @xmath11 lying in the inertial range , the flux rate of kinetic energy is equal to the injection rate of kinetic energy at the forcing scale .",
    "this writes @xmath12 , leading to @xmath13 and to the kolmogorov spectrum @xmath14 .",
    "secondly , the inertial range is found to extend to the viscous scale @xmath15 which can be evaluated saying that at this scale the turn over time @xmath16 compares with the viscous time @xmath17 , leading to @xmath18 .",
    "thirdly at low viscosity some deviation of the kolmogorov power scaling is found due to intermittency .",
    "the power scaling of the statistical moments are given by @xmath19 with scaling exponents @xmath20 deviating from kolmogrov s mean field theory @xmath21 .",
    "the value of these anomalous scaling exponents given by the shell models compare well with those found in experiments @xcite .",
    "therefore shell models appear to be a useful tool to study fully developed turbulence at high reynolds numbers .",
    "they are also used in their mhd version to tackle astrophysical issues @xcite .    in a previous paper @xcite , denoted after by ps07",
    ", we introduced a non local shell model which is not only in agreement with the previous features of turbulence but in addition gives an appropriate slope of the infrared spectrum in freely decaying turbulence ( which is not the case of the local shell models described in biferale 2003 ) .",
    "the magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) version of this model , also introduced in ps07 , permits to study turbulent dynamo action for arbitrary low or high values of @xmath0 . in ps07",
    "we calculated the energy transfer functions of the mhd system in a ( statistically stationary ) saturated state .",
    "we found that for @xmath22 the energy transfers are mainly local , eventually strengthening our previous results obtained with a local shell model of mhd turbulence @xcite .",
    "for @xmath23 the dominant transfers are also mainly local except the ones from the flow scales lying in the inertial range to the magnetic scales smaller than the viscous scale . in that case",
    "the use of a non local model is definitely necessary .",
    "here our goal is to describe the transient properties of the turbulent dynamo , namely the kinematic regime during which the magnetic energy grows exponentially , and the route to saturation , starting when the kinematic regime stops and ending when a ( statistically stationary ) saturated state is reached .",
    "for that it is not sufficient to make time averages as we did in ps07 when studying the saturated dynamo states . indeed the transient properties we are interested in are , by definition , not statistically stationary .",
    "then instead of time averages we have made ensemble averages over @xmath24 independent realisations .",
    "the initial conditions have the same energy but random phases .",
    "in addition the forcing has also a random phase in time ( therefore different from one realisation to the other ) .",
    "then the results between two realisations are different . every @xmath25 unit of time",
    "we freeze the calculation . for each shell",
    "we average the magnetic and kinetic energy over the @xmath26 realisations without modifying the phases of the magnetic , kinetic and forcing quantities in order to keep the randomness between every realisations .",
    "all the calculation were done for @xmath27 shells , corresponding to more than 12 decades . before presenting the results ( sections [ lowpm ] and [ highpm ] for low and high @xmath0 ) we briefly describe in the next section the shell model ( previously introduced in ps07 ) .",
    "the model is defined by the following set of equations @xmath28 - \\nu k_n^2 u_n + f_n , \\label{eq_u } \\\\",
    "\\dot{b}_n & = & i k_n \\left[q_n(u , b , b)-q_n(b , u , b)\\right ] - \\eta k_n^2 b_n , \\label{eq_b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 \\label{qn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] represents the non linear transfer rates and @xmath30 the turbulence forcing applied at shell @xmath31 . as explained in ps07 an optimum shell spacing is the golden number @xmath32 .    for @xmath33 in ( [ qn ] ) , we recognize the local sabra model @xcite .",
    "the additional non - local interactions for @xmath34 correspond to all other possible triad interactions except the ones involving two identical scales .",
    "expressions for the kinetic energy and helicity @xmath35 and @xmath36 , magnetic energy and helicity @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and cross helicity @xmath39 are given by @xmath40    in the inviscid and non - resistive limit ( @xmath41 ) , the total energy @xmath42 , magnetic helicity and cross helicity must be conserved ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this implies the following expression for the coefficients @xmath44 and @xmath45 : @xmath46 in the case of pure hydrodynamic turbulence ( without magnetic field ) , the coefficients @xmath44 derived from the kinetic energy and helicity conservations ( @xmath47 ) , would lead to the same expression as ( [ coefficients ] ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath48 are free parameters depending on @xmath49 only , that we choose of the form @xmath50 .",
    "further characteristics of the model and results can be found in ps07 .",
    "in particular the role of the non locality parameter @xmath51 has been investigated .",
    "it is indeed the only free parameter left in the model that can not be theoretically constrained .",
    "in ps07 we found that taking @xmath52 permits to describe accurately the infrared hydrodynamic spectrum in freely decaying turbulence . keeping this value of @xmath51 in the mhd system for @xmath53",
    ", we found that the dominant energy transfers are mainly local .    on the other hand , for @xmath23 , in order to describe properly the non local energy transfer from the flow scales lying in the inertial range to the magnetic scales smaller than the viscous scale , the results obtained in ps07 suggest to take a parameter @xmath51 corresponding to stronger non local transfers than those obtained for @xmath52 . a phenomenological justification of the choice @xmath54 will be given below .",
    "it can be also understood as a way to mimic in our ( isotropic ) model the strongly anisotropic small scale magnetic turbulence .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that taking @xmath54 does not affect too much the energy transfers involving the magnetic scales lying in the inertial range , which remain mainly local .",
    "at low @xmath0 , as shown in ps07 , the energy transfers responsible for the generation of the magnetic from the kinetic energy are mainly local and the flow scales producing the largest magnetic growthrate lie in the inertial range . a phenomenological way to understand it is to write the induction equation at wave number @xmath55 , in the form @xmath56 leading to the following growthrate @xmath57 assuming a kolmogorov spectrum in the flow inertial range , @xmath58",
    ", we find @xmath59 which is plotted in figure [ gamma ] . in the kinematic regime due to the linearity of the induction equation",
    "all magnetic scales grow with the same growthrate @xmath60 .",
    "it occurs at @xmath61 with the value @xmath62 ."
