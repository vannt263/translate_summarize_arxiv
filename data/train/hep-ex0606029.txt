    "[ sec : intro ]    hadron - nucleus interactions constitute a unique laboratory for the study of hadronization in the non - perturbative sector of qcd by offering , in particular , access to multiple hadronic collision processes and by opening an important link to nucleus - nucleus reactions .",
    "in fact the latter process can not be understood properly without reference to the more elementary hadron - hadron and hadron - nucleus interactions .",
    "past attempts in this field have been largely frustrated by the absence of detailed and consistent data sets both from hadron - hadron and from hadron - nucleus collisions .",
    "the na49 experiment aims at providing such data sets obtained with the same detector over a wide range of projectile and target combinations @xcite by measuring yields of identified secondaries with a dense coverage of the available phase space .",
    "a recent publication concerning pion production in p+p collisions @xcite has now been followed by data of similar quality from minimum - bias p+c interactions @xcite .",
    "this allows for a new attempt at comparing both reactions and extracting quantitative information about hadronization involving light nuclei .",
    "the hadronization process in hadron - nucleus interactions consists of three distinct components :    * the projectile fragmentation which carries the imprint of multiple collisions in nuclear matter and is the part of principle interest for this study . *",
    "the fragmentation of the participating target nucleons . *",
    "the contribution from intranuclear cascading which is generated by the propagation and interaction of the participating nucleons and produced hadrons inside the nucleus .",
    "the separation of the three components is non - trivial if it is to be conducted in a model - independent way .",
    "it has been demonstrated by na49 for the first time in p+pb collisions concerning net proton production @xcite . in this case",
    "the full range of projectile and target combinations available to the experiment has been used , with baryon number conservation as the only external constraint .    for pions",
    "the situation is more complex as there is no conservation law ( except charge conservation ) to be exploited .",
    "in addition the target cascading part extends closer to the central region than for protons , up to @xmath9 values of about -0.05 .",
    "both the target and the projectile components feed - over into the respective opposite hemispheres with a priori unknown ranges and shapes of the longitudinal momentum distributions .",
    "these parameters should be determined experimentally without taking recourse to unfounded model assumptions .",
    "the present study will attempt the quantification and separation of the relevant components , with a special view to the extraction of the projectile contribution in its longitudinal and transverse momentum behaviour .",
    "for this aim the reference to the elementary hadron - proton interactions is absolutely essential and most of the argumentation will be established in direct comparison to these processes , invoking isospin symmetry as an important constraint for the constitution of the target contribution .    in its first part the paper deals with @xmath10 integrated @xmath9 distributions since the superposition process is to first order a matter of longitudinal momentum space . after a presentation of the longitudinal pion yields in relation to p+p collisions in sect .",
    "[ sec : comp_pp ] , constraints on the overlap of target and projectile components from elementary interactions are developed in sect .  [ sec : pp_two ] , resulting in a two - component picture of these collisions .",
    "this two - component picture is applied to the p+c reaction in sect .",

    "this allows for the extraction of the multiple collision part of the interaction for a number of typical observables , and a comparison to the centrality - constrained data available from the experiment in sect .",

    "the paper will exploit the more detailed behaviour of double inclusive cross sections which give access to the study of transverse momentum behaviour .",

    "[ sec : comp_pp ]      the most general reduction of the multiparticle phase space of pion production that may be obtained is the @xmath10 integrated , charge - averaged ( @xmath12 ) longitudinal momentum distribution , in the following characterized by the scaling variable    @xmath13    where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are given in the nucleon - nucleon cms .",
    "this distribution is compared to the p+p interaction @xcite by forming the ratio    @xmath16    and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2p_mean ] . here",
    "the integrated pion densities @xmath17 are obtained from the interpolated double differential cross sections as described in detail in @xcite and @xcite .    since the acceptance for particle identification of the na49 detector imposes a limit @xcite at @xmath9  =  -0.03 for the complete integration of the @xmath10 distributions , a slight extrapolation to @xmath18",
    "is also indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : c2p_mean ] .",
    "this extrapolation uses an extension of the data interpolation developed for the p+c data @xcite into the non - measured region of @xmath10 .",
    "it will be justified in the following sections of this paper .",
    "the upper limit of the comparison at @xmath9  =  0.5 is due to the limited event statistics in the p+c data sample .",
    "several features of interest emerge from this first comparison .",
    "the ratio r decreases smoothly from about 1.6 at the limit of @xmath9  =  -0.1 via 1.38 at @xmath9  =  0 to a value of 0.85 at @xmath9  =  0.5 .",
    "the factor 1.6 is close to the expected mean number of projectile collisions @xmath19 inside the carbon nucleus ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : aspects ] ) and the value 1.38 at @xmath9  =  0 is close to the expectation ( @xmath19  +  1)/2 from the most straight - forward projectile - target superposition scheme @xcite .",
    "the decrease of particle density in the far forward direction recalls a known phenomenon of projectile fragmentation .",
    "it corresponds to the @xmath9 dependence of the exponent @xmath20 in the parametrization    @xmath21    where a is the nuclear weight . for a limited range in transverse momentum and for the far forward direction alpha",
    "has been shown to decrease as a function of @xmath9 @xcite .    the increased particle density in the region -0.1",
    "@xmath22  0.2 on the other hand is due to the superposition of the two principle components of the hadronization process , namely the target nucleons participating in the collision and the projectile itself .",
    "the quantification and extraction of these two basic ingredients to the p+a interaction is the main aim of this study which can for the first time make full use of the important transition region between the two components .",
    "this transition region will be shown to be located between the limits -0.1",
    "@xmath22  0.1 .    a first indication concerning the validity of the extrapolation towards @xmath9  =  -0.1 used in fig .",

    "is experimentally available .",
    "it appears that the effect of the successively increasing cut - offs is on the few percent level for negative @xmath9 and can therefore be considered as a second order phenomenon .",

    "the quantitatively larger effect in the forward hemisphere is noteworthy .",
    "it has its origin in the sizeable increase in @xmath24 for p+c compared to p+p interactions with ultimately very important @xmath10 dependencies in the range @xmath25  1.5  gev / c ( sect .",

    "evidently there are differences both in the far forward , the projectile hemisphere , and more pronounced , in the backward region .",
    "the former effect results in a sizeable increase of the @xmath26/@xmath27 ratio for @xmath28  0.3 and signals an important modification of the projectile fragmentation mechanism .",
    "the latter effect is directly related to the target . due to isospin symmetry",
    "@xcite the neutron content of the carbon nucleus enhances the @xmath27 and suppresses the @xmath26 yields from the target relative to the p+p interaction .",
    "the observation of the @xmath26/@xmath27 ratio in this region can therefore provide direct , model - independent access to the relative target contribution .",

    "these effects will be studied quantitatively in sect .",

    "[ sec : pp_two ]    the superposition and separation of the target and projectile components in p+a collisions is a main ingredient for the argumentation of this paper .",
    "the inspection of these two components also in the elementary hadron - proton interactions is therefore a necessary condition for the model - independent interpretation of the data .",
    "the discussion will be built around three experimental facts :    * the absence of long - range two - particle correlations at @xmath35  0.2 . *",
    "the presence of forward - backward multiplicity correlations at @xmath36  0.1 . * the @xmath9 dependence of the @xmath26/@xmath27 ratio in @xmath37+p collisions .",

    "no deviation of @xmath43 from unity is visible within tight error bars with the only exception of the regions of large @xmath9 where energy - momentum conservation will finally impose some correlations of kinematic origin @xcite .",
    "some of the important results of this experiment concern the absence of charge or flavour exchange , the indication of gluon exchange as the exclusive exchange mechanism in soft hadronic collisions at the sps / isr energy , and the proof that no notable forward - backward correlations exist above the limit of @xmath45  =  0.2 .",
    "[ sec : fb_mult ]    a series of bubble chamber experiments @xcite at sps energies , and a streamer chamber experiment at the isr @xcite have extended the study of @xcite to full phase space by establishing multiplicity correlations between the forward and the backward hemisphere . in experiments [ 8 - 10 ]",
    "the complete @xmath9 region is accessible by momentum measurement in the fixed - target laboratory frame .",
    "since there is no particle identification available , the assumption of pion mass for the necessary lorentz transformation creates a certain but practically negligible bias in the determination of central rapidity .",
    "experiment @xcite has no momentum measurement and only determines pseudo - rapidity @xmath46 but the @xmath46  =  0 reference is uniquely given for all particles by the angle measurement alone due to the collider geometry of the isr .",

    "it is worth while commenting on the energy dependence of the correlation determined by @xcite .",
    "in fact the correlation factor b increases steadily with @xmath15 and reaches a value of @xmath53  =  0.31 at @xmath15  =  62 gev .",
    "it has been established @xcite that this increase is not accompanied by an extension of the feed - over range in @xmath9 by showing that the correlation vanishes by replacing the cut at @xmath55  1 by an @xmath56-dependent one at @xmath55  @xmath57 .",
    "this cut happens to correspond in first order to an @xmath56-independent @xmath9 cut at 0.05 .",
    "the increase in the correlation is therefore due to the non - scaling increase of central pion production characterized by the rising `` rapidity plateau '' @xcite .",
    "[ sec : pi_rat ]    the range and shape of the feed - over components of hadronic interactions can also be constrained by using asymmetric collisions and by exploiting a measured quantity that exhibits a predicted behaviour for either the projectile or the target fragmentation .",

    "the same ratio for p+p collisions shows the known strong increase with @xmath9 @xcite which is reflecting the presence of the proton projectile .",
    "surprisingly , the approach of the charge ratio to unity is not smooth but shows a characteristic structure with a secondary maximum at @xmath29  0.04 which is reminiscent of the similar behaviour of this ratio in the target hemisphere of p+c interactions , fig .",

    "it has been shown there that the contribution from single collisions grows as @xmath9  =  1 is approached since the pion yield from multiple collisions is progressively suppressed at large @xmath9 .",
    "as @xmath115 is unity for single collisions , the enhancement should tend towards one for large @xmath9 .",
    "the influence of @xmath68 on the variation of the measured enhancement with @xmath9 can be described by a multiplicative weight function @xmath121 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : targ_sch]c .",
    "this function approaches the value of 1.6  @xmath122  1/@xmath68 for @xmath96  1 and reduces to @xmath122  0.9 in the backward region due to the yield increase from the projectile fragmentation .",
    "concerning the target - projectile superposition , it can be stated that the range of the corresponding target - projectile feed - over is larger than at low transverse momentum ( sect .",
    "[ sec : pc_two ] ) and reaches @xmath1230.3 .",
    "this indicates an important @xmath10 dependence .",
    "this is quantified by writing down the composition of the measured enhancement @xmath115 from the target ( @xmath124  =  1 ) and the projectile ( @xmath125 ) components :    @xmath126    where @xmath127 . here",
    "@xmath110 and @xmath111 specify the shape of the relative target and projectile contributions as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this shape is constrained by the boundary conditions @xmath128(-0.3 )  =  @xmath129(0.3 )  =  0 and @xmath128(@xmath28",

    "[ fig : targ_sch ] .",
    "evidently these functions are more similar to the proton than to the low-@xmath10 pion feed - over shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipr_fover ] .",

    "[ eq : meas_enh ] as    @xmath130    the @xmath9 dependence of @xmath125 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : proj_enh ] .    as an important consequence of this decomposition",
    "it appears that the measured nuclear enhancement at @xmath9  =  0 is not fully representative of the phenomenon .",
    "it is very substantially increased if proper account is taken of the `` inert '' target contribution in p+a reactions .",
    "this is very important for the understanding of the nuclear enhancement in the symmetric a+a interactions where the target and projectile contribution are equally contributing . from this consideration alone",
    "it must be expected that the measured nuclear enhancement in a+a collisions must be larger than in p+a collisions .",
    "if however properly extracting the projectile component the enhancement should tend to be equal in both types of reaction at equal @xmath19 per projectile ( p+a ) or participant ( a+a ) , unless new physics phenomena should be present in a+a interactions .",
    "the influence of single collisions on the measured nuclear enhancement is particularly important in the p+c case discussed here , as the probability @xmath68 is about 0.6 and the corresponding enhancement should be unity for this contribution . taking account of the weight function @xmath121 introduced above",
    ", the enhancement due to multiple collisions can be extracted as    @xmath131    the application of eq .",
    "[ eq : corr_enh ] results in a further , very considerable increase of the nuclear enhancement over the full @xmath9 range as evident from fig .",
    "[ fig : proj_enh ] .",
    "the final result for @xmath132 is very different indeed from the measured quantity @xmath115 . in this context",
    "the application of straight - forward parametrizations of the a - dependence , as they are applied in the description of the nuclear enhancement , sect .",
    "[ sec : nuc_enh ] above , is to be regarded with great caution .",
    "this because the probability @xmath68 depends strongly on a , see fig .  [",
    "fig : nu_prob ] . by relating the effect in p+be to the one in p+w for instance ,",
    "one compares cases where @xmath68 differs by a more than a factor of 3 .",
    "this means that the exponent @xmath119 will decrease appreciably once the trivial effect of single collisions is taken out .",
    "as far as a+a collisions are concerned , the correct way of comparison would be to relate minimum bias p+a to minimum bias a+a collisions where the distributions @xmath69 are equal @xcite . for centrality selected collisions , this condition is more difficult to fulfill as the probability @xmath68 stays always greater than zero for a+a interactions even for impact parameter zero , whereas it vanishes for central p+a interactions @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the nuclear enhancement as a @xmath10 dependent phenomenon necessitates the use of kinematic variables that are orthogonal in the transverse and longitudinal components , as is the case for the @xmath9/@xmath10 combination used here . by describing the same phenomenon in the variables rapidity @xmath50 and @xmath10",
    ", a completely different picture will emerge as the use of @xmath50 combines both the transverse and the longitudinal evolution of the particle densities , except , of course , at @xmath50  =  0 .",
    "this is exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig : rap ] where the @xmath50 dependence of the enhancement factor    @xmath133    with @xmath134 , is presented at the same four values of transverse momentum as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ept ] .",
    "the strong increase of the nuclear enhancement with @xmath9 is replaced by a flat @xmath50-dependence up to @xmath135  1 , followed by a strong decrease for @xmath136  1.5 . from this plot alone",
    "one might erroneously conclude that the cronin effect vanishes in forward direction , whereas is reality one is looking at the longitudinal decrease of particle density in p+a collisions , see sect .  [ sec : pc_two ] above .",
    "experimentally it is often difficult , if not impossible , to fulfill the orthogonality condition mentioned above .",
    "this is true for all experiments being limited by a polar angle ( or rapidity ) cutoff in forward direction , where the low @xmath10 region may not be accessible at all above a certain limit of @xmath9 .",
    "this is typical of collider experiments . for the brahms detector at rhic , for instance ,",
    "the rapidity limit of 3.2 units corresponds to a @xmath10 cutoff at 0.8  gev / c already at @xmath9  =  0.1 where the measured nuclear enhancement is still increasing , and at @xmath10  =  2 gev / c for @xmath9  =  0.25 where it reaches its maximum .",
    "the production and decay of resonances constitutes a much neglected but important field of studies concerning soft hadronization .",
    "as already pointed out in @xcite many details of the inclusive pion distributions directly show the imprint of resonance decay . in the context of the present paper several of the extracted features concerning the two - component nature of the hadronization process",
    "will be discussed here in relation to resonance decay .",
    "this concerns in particular the following experimental findings :    * the shape and feed - over of the extracted , @xmath10 integrated projectile component ( sects .",
    "[ sec : pp_two ] and [ sec : pc_two ] ) . * its dependence on particle mass ( sect .",
    "[ sec : baryon ] ) .",
    "* its important @xmath10 dependence up to the limit of the na49 data at 1.8  gev / c ( sect .  [ sec : high_pt ] ) .    as a complete treatment of the manifestations of resonance phenomena",
    "exceeds the scope of this paper and has to be left to a coming publication , only some basic mechanisms which are of straight - forward kinematic origin will be treated here , using a single resonance as a tool for explanation .",
    "the resonance chosen is the @xmath137(1232 ) whose inclusive @xmath9 and @xmath10 distributions have been determined in an adequate fashion for the present purpose @xcite .",
    "its measured , @xmath10 integrated @xmath9 distribution is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : delta ] together with the target and projectile components constructed from it , using the baryonic feed - over shape as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : baryon ] .    the two - body decay @xmath138 performed for the projectile component of fig .",
    "[ fig : delta ] yields @xmath10 integrated @xmath9 distributions of the decay products as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dec_prod ] .",
    "a first observation concerns the overall shape of the @xmath26 distribution in comparison to the extracted inclusive projectile contributions shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : pp_2comp ] and [ fig : shape ] .",
    "although there are of course deviations in detail , as to be expected from the single , low - mass resonance studied here , the overall agreement in shape and @xmath9-range is very evident .",
    "this concerns specifically the limited range of the pion feed - over into the target hemisphere .",
    "a second observation concerns the difference of this feed - over between proton and pion .",
    "the mass dependence quantified in fig.11b is reproduced insofar as the baryon distribution reaches much further into the opposite hemisphere than for the pion .",
    "this effect is of course a straight - forward consequence of the lorentz transformation between the resonance rest frame and the overall cms .",
    "the energy factor of this transformation reads    @xmath139    where @xmath140 is the decay particle mass and @xmath141 is given by    @xmath142    at the nominal mass of the @xmath137 this corresponds to 0.229  gev / c which is much smaller than the proton mass .",
    "the proton therefore receives , in contrast to the pion , a major fraction of the resonance momentum in the cms of the interaction .",
    "a third observation concerning @xmath10 dependence is obtained by studying the @xmath137 decay for pions in bins of transverse momentum , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : delta_pt ] .    for the same bins used in fig .",
    "[ fig : ept ] above , the distributions are normalized to unity at @xmath9  =  0 in order to calibrate the strong @xmath10 dependence of the cross section .",
    "evidently there is a steady increase of the range of feed - over with increasing transverse momentum .",
    "the shape dependence of the @xmath10 integrated @xmath9 distributions on the lower integration limit demonstrated in figs .",
    "[ fig : c2p_ptcut ] and [ fig : c2p_charge ] finds thereby a natural explanation . at the upper @xmath10 limit of the na49 data at 1.8  gev / c , the shape of the pion distribution approaches the one measured for the proton .",
    "this effect has been used for the extraction of the projectile component of the @xmath10 enhancement , fig .",
    "[ fig : targ_sch ] .",
    "this third observation follows again from the resonance decay kinematics .",
    "in fact the most efficient way to obtain high transverse momentum for low mass secondaries is to exploit the breit - wigner tail of the resonance mass distribution which reaches , in the case of the @xmath143(1232 ) , values well above 2  gev .",
    "correspondingly the decay momentum @xmath141 ( eq .  [ eq : q ] ) increases into the 1  gev / c region which in turn reduces the mass dependence ( eq .  [ eq : mass ] ) and increases the range of the feed - over .",
    "it is therefore necessary to take proper account of the resonance mass distribution in any quantitative work on hadronization dealing with resonance decay .",
    "following these observations , resonance decay as a source of `` high @xmath10 '' production in the sense defined above has to be considered very seriously . using a sum of 13 measured resonances it has indeed been demonstrated for p+p collisions @xcite that the inclusive pion distributions resulting from two body decays saturate the yields up to @xmath10  =  3  gev / c and beyond simultaneously over the full range of @xmath9",
    ". a modification of the resonance spectrum towards higher masses in multiple collisions would therefore be sufficient to also describe the anomalous nuclear enhancement in this @xmath10 range , at sps energies , without invoking partonic or perturbative effects .",
    "this paper attempts a new assessment of the p+a interaction with light nuclei at sps energy which is based exclusively on experimental data .",
    "the study leads to a number of conclusions which cover a wide range of observables .",
    "they may be subsummed as follows :    * the reference to a set of experimental results obtained in elementary and nuclear interactions , in particular to the new precision data from the na49 detector in p+c and p+p collisions , allows for a model independent argumentation . *",
    "this argumentation clearly establishes the composition of the p+a reaction from three basic components : projectile fragmentation , target fragmentation , and intranuclear cascading . * these contributions",
    "have been isolated and quantified one by one .",
    "* intranuclear cascading governs the far backward hemisphere .",
    "its contribution rapidly decreases towards @xmath9  =  0 and corresponds to only a couple of percent relative to the participant fragmentation at @xmath9  =  -0.1 .",
    "* for the remaining target and projectile contributions , a clear two component picture has been established .",
    "the two components overlap in a limited zone around @xmath9  =  0 .",
    "the extent of this zone is shown to depend on particle species and transverse momentum .",
    "it is limited to @xmath144  0.1 for the @xmath10 integrated pion yield and reaches out to @xmath144  0.25 at @xmath10 of 1.8  gev / c .",
    "* target fragmentation reflects the superposition of participant hadronization , revealing the detailed charge dependence introduced by the isospin composition of the nucleus .",
    "the total pion yield from this source corresponds to an average of 1.6 participant target nucleons which is close to but significantly below the number expected from measured nuclear parameters .",
    "* the extraction of detailed features of the projectile fragmentation has been the main aim of the study . in relation to elementary collisions a complex pattern of deviations",
    "emerges which concerns practically all measured quantities .",
    "* the total pion yield increases by about 10% as compared to the elementary interaction .",
    "this increase is concentrated near @xmath9  =  0 with a shape that matches the density distribution of the projectile component . * above @xmath29  0.2 the differential yield decreases steadily with respect to elementary collisions as @xmath9 increases , with a specific charge dependence . * using the well defined probability for single projectile collisions , the contribution from multiple collisions has been extracted and compared to the centrality controlled p+c data subsample . * the detailed @xmath10 dependence of the projectile component has been established in comparison to elementary collisions . in the neighbourhood of the mean transverse momentum",
    "the comparison is characterized by important , charge dependent local structure . with increasing transverse momentum a general increase of pion yield",
    "is established .",
    "* this increase is quantified by an enhancement factor which shows strong @xmath9 dependence and has been corrected for the inert contributions from target fragmentation and from single collisions . *",
    "the relation to the anomalous nuclear enhancement ( cronin effect ) is established and it is demonstrated that a new assessment of this phenomenon is mandatory from a purely experimental point of view . * finally the importance of resonance production and decay for virtually",
    "all studied quantities is evoked .",
