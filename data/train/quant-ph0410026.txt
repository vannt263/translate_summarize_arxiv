    "quantum control is the ability to drive a quantum system toward desired states having disparate and arbitrary properties in terms of degree of purity and entanglement .",
    "the proposal and realization of schemes for the guidance of physical devices is central to the tasks of quantum information processing ( qip ) as many of the protocols proposed so far may be formally interpreted in terms of control of an apparatus operated through classical or quantum potentials  @xcite .",
    "however , it is commonly accepted that any external interference on a physical device opens channels to the interaction of the system itself with the uncontrollable environment , leading to decoherence  @xcite .",
    "many different strategies have been suggested , in these years , to correct or avoid the effects of decoherence , ranging from quantum error - correcting codes  @xcite to quantum computing in decoherence - free subspaces  @xcite or dynamical - decoupling techniques  @xcite .",
    "another possible strategy is represented by the use of feedback to recursively modify the dynamics of a system .",
    "a common feature of all these proposals is that they operate directly on the system to control .",
    "that is , _ local _ guidance is performed .",
    "however , it would be desirable to have a procedure allowing for a non - intrusive driving of a quantum device . in this case",
    ", the quantum control will be _ remote _ in the sense that the active part of a guidance protocol ( including unitary and non - unitary operations ) should be realized on an ancilla connected to the system we are interested in .",
    "this strategy is interesting , for example , for the purpose of creating a quantum channel to be used for later tasks of a processing protocol .",
    "the channel could be generated with minimal interventions of its constituents and its purity and entanglement could be regulated acting on a remote _ knob_. in this paper , we address some recently proposed schemes for the purification of a quantum state and entanglement creation  @xcite under the point of view of quantum remote control .",
    "we show how these schemes can be suitably modified in order to perform quantum guidance of a two - qubit state .",
    "in details , nakazato _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested a scheme for the probabilistic purification of the state of a quantum system ( labeled b from now on ) . the scheme is based on the repeated measurements of the state of an ancillary system , here indicated as a , which interacts with b through some local hamiltonian @xmath0 .",
    "system b is prepared in a state @xmath1 we want to purify while system a is initialized in @xmath2 .",
    "let us assume that we are able to implement the projective measurement @xmath3 .",
    "we apply the following program : a+b evolve through @xmath0 for a time interval @xmath4 and state a is checked to be in @xmath2 .",
    "tracing out the ancillary system , b evolves as @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "the observation by nakazato _",
    "is that , if in the spectral decomposition of @xmath7 there is a single term dominating over the rest of the spectrum , then system b is progressively purified by the repeated application of this evolution - detection protocol .",
    "the scheme is probabilistic with a probability of success ( _ i.e. _ the probability that @xmath1 is driven toward a pure state @xmath8 ) that critically depends on @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "it is worth stressing that , due to the non - unitary nature of the projector @xmath10 , it is impossible to describe the effective dynamics of subsystem b alone using the operator - sum representation  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it has been recognized  @xcite that this same scheme may be generalized to the cases in which the system to purify is intrinsically multipartite ( subparties @xmath11 ) . in this case , the repeated measurements operated on the ancilla a project system b onto a pure entangled state of the subsystems @xmath12 .    in this work , we assess the protocol for the generation of entangled pure states of a composite system b under the point of view of quantum guidance of a system .",
    "we heuristically develop the intuition ( implicitly underlying ref .",
    "@xcite ) that the effectiveness of the purification scheme through repeated measurements ( _ zeno - like measurements _ , in the language of nakazato _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ) may be ascribed to some kind of quantum control procedure .",
    "we suggest a scheme that is nearer to experimental state of the art . in our analysis , indeed , we get rid of the unrealistic assumption of measurements projecting the ancilla onto the _ bona fide _ state @xmath13 ( a condition that is challenging in many practical cases ) . furthermore , no feedback is required , in our procedure , but just the post - selection of favourable events and the proper control of the interaction interval .",
    "we show that , considering the ancillary system a to be embodied by a bipartite continuous variable ( cv ) system , a wide range of possibilities for quantum state guidance is offered . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this point was never addressed in this context .",
    "just one - qubit systems were used to embody the ancilla  @xcite .",
    "we set the scenario in order to show that a two - mode cv _ mediator _ , in a proper initial entangled state , is able to drive two qubits , labelled @xmath14 and @xmath15 , toward a pure state , distilling entanglement at the same time .",
    "we consider a system of two remote qubits , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , each defined in hilbert spaces spanned by the basis @xmath16 @xmath17 .",
    "the qubits are initially prepared in a separable state and are mutually independent ( there is no direct interaction between the qubits all along the quantum control protocol ) .",
    "the qubits constitute the subparties of system b whose state we want to control .",
    "each qubit interacts with a cv system ( @xmath14 interacts with @xmath18 and @xmath15 with @xmath19 ) which is in an entangled state .",
    "we consider local interactions @xmath20 between each qubit and the corresponding cv mode .",
    "a sketch of the scheme we consider is shown in fig .",
    "[ principio ] .",
    "after the subsystems mutually interact via @xmath0 for a time interval @xmath21 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are measured  @xcite .",
    "a good source of quantum correlated two - mode states of a cv system is a non - degenerate - parametric - amplifier generating a two - mode squeezed vacuum ( tmsv ) of its squeezing parameter @xmath22  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it has been recently shown that the fidelity of teleportation of a coherent state can be improved  @xcite and the loophole - free non - locality test is possible  @xcite by conditioning the cv entangled resource ( embodied in a tmsv ) through linear optical elements and photodetection  @xcite .",
    "the specific form of the state considered in  @xcite is the _ photon - subtracted state _ ( pss ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 , @xmath25 is a photon - number state and @xmath26 is a normalization . the probabilistic generation of eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) using a tmsv , high - transmittivity beam - splitters and photodetectors is described in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as in the teleportation protocol , the ancilla a@xmath27 represents a resource .",
    "its role , in this paper , is the catalysis of the purification process and the distillation of entanglement between the qubits . under this point of view",
    ", we have to look for the best choice for system a. even though the entire analysis and the results we report in this work can be generalized to any form of a two - mode quantum correlated state , we have checked that the choice of a pss offers a good result in terms of entanglement and purity for the qubit state .",
    "this is essentially due to the fact that the conditioned way in which a pss is generated from a tmsv effectively results in an entanglement distillation procedure .",
    "this can be seen noticing that in a tmsv , the photon - number distribution @xmath28 ( _ i.e. _ the probability amplitude for the two - mode photon - number state @xmath29 ) is @xmath30 , which is rapidly decreasing function of @xmath31 . in a pss , on the other hand ,",
    "the presence of the @xmath32 factor shifts @xmath33 toward higher photon - number states .",
    "this results , in turns , in a higher von neumann entropy  @xcite for the pss than for the tmsv , at any value of the squeezing parameter @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the main difficulty related to @xmath34 is the small probability with which such a state is generated  @xcite .",
    "however , this is certainly not the central point of our investigation .",
    "we will consider the generation of the pss as an off - line resource and , for the sake of generality , we do not specify the physical system chosen to embody the qubits .",
    "having identified the form of the state for our ancilla , we can apply the idealized protocol for purification .",
    "we have to calculate the structure of the operator @xmath7 analogous to the one in eq .",
    "( [ zero ] ) . in our case",
    ", it is @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . here , @xmath40 .",
    "to check the effectiveness of the purification procedure , we have to look for the eigendecomposition of @xmath7 .",
    "we find that , together with the double - degenerate eigenvalue @xmath41 , the spectrum of @xmath7 includes the eigenvalues @xmath42/2o_{14}$ ] which correspond to the eigenoperators @xmath43 respectively . here ,",
    "@xmath44_{12}$ ] .",
    "the eigenspectrum is shown in fig .",
    "[ nakaz ] where it is evident that @xmath45 is much larger than @xmath46 and @xmath47 at any @xmath48 . in particular , at @xmath49 , we find @xmath50 .",
    "this means that by repeating the protocol @xmath51 times and post - selecting the favourable events in which the subsystem a=@xmath52 is detected in @xmath34 , the joint state of the qubits @xmath14 and @xmath15 is projected onto a state with an increasing degree of purity and entanglement ( even if , given that @xmath53 , the state can not be maximally entangled ) . in order to quantify the degree of entanglement , we use the entanglement measure based on _ negativity of partial transposition _ ( npt )",
    "npt is a necessary and sufficient condition for entanglement of any bipartite qubit state  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding degree of entanglement is defined as @xmath54 with @xmath55 the negative eigenvalue of the partial transposition of the qubit density matrix . with this tool",
    ", we find that for qubits initially prepared in their ground states , after just one iteration , the degree of entanglement for the resulting two - qubit state is @xmath56 , which is improved to @xmath57 after @xmath58 iterations  @xcite .",
    "however , in this protocol , a way to reliably perform the von neumann measurements onto the prepared state of the ancilla is required .",
    "checking exactly whether or not the ancilla is in its state @xmath59 is , in general , a very hard task under a practical point of view . even if in the case of qubits embodying the ancillary system a ( that is basically the case considered in refs .",
    "@xcite ) one may envisage some strategy to perform the desired projections , this seems not to be the case when a cv system is used .",
    "this should strongly affect the performances of the entire procedure .",
    "nevertheless , a way to bypass the problem represented by the measurement step can be found , as it is argued in the next section .",
    "the suggestions in refs .",
    "@xcite to purify a qubit state and to distill entanglement are certainly intriguing due to the possibility of conditionally modifying the state of a system without directly interfering with it in a non - unitary way . here",
    ", we look for a way to retain the basic idea behind these schemes , _ i.e. _ the modifications of the qubit state by interventions on an ancillary system .",
    "however , we abandon the idealized projective measurements .",
    "the aim of this section is to show that , with suitable modifications of the original protocol , the problem represented by the difficult von neumann projections may be bypassed without affecting the effectiveness of the procedure .",
    "we consider a more realistic detection model that can be generalized to include arbitrary detection inefficiencies .",
    "our protocol allows us to track the evolution of the two - qubit state showing that true quantum control can be performed with the qubits being actively driven toward a desired state .",
    "while the system we consider remains essentially the same as described in the previous section , here we introduce a _ near to reality _ detection step .",
    "we borrow the language from the quantum optics language and model the detection step by geiger - like on / off detectors that discriminate the presence or absence of excitations in the cv states , irrespective of the excitation number .",
    "the quantum efficiency of each detector ( assumed to be the same ) is @xmath60 .",
    "an inefficient detector is formally described by the positive - operator - valued - measure ( povm )  @xcite @xmath61 where @xmath62 .",
    "the effect of detection inefficiencies on the quantum control protocol will be fully taken into account later on . for a while",
    ", we consider perfect detectors of @xmath63 , so that @xmath64 .",
    "furthermore , at each step of the control procedure , the qubits will interact with a fresh quantum correlated state of modes @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "that is , there is no direct feedback of the ancilla state ( another hard task in the original protocol @xcite ) but the qubits interact repeatedly with the fresh ancilla .",
    "we consider the evolution of the qubit system resulting from the following program : the quantum correlated state of the cv system is prepared and the qubit register is initialized as @xmath65 .",
    "the subsystems interact through the joint interaction @xmath0 that gives rise to the direct product of local unitaries @xmath66 , where @xmath67 ( @xmath62 and @xmath68 ) . for the sake of definiteness",
    ", we assume the hamiltonian model @xmath69 to be of the resonant jaynes - cummings form  @xcite .",
    "this is a natural model that turns out to be valid in many physical situations in which coherent exchange of excitations between spin - like particles and bosonic modes are involved  @xcite ( however , our study can be extended to any other entangling qubit - mode interaction ) .",
    "after the evolution , the state of the cv system is detected .",

    "this is an effect due to the particular symmetries in the quantum - correlated state of the ancilla and it assures that our protocol reproduces the right form of the density matrix . our task is to show that the degree of entanglement and purity for the qubits progressively increase as the protocol is repeated .",
    "it is straightforward to prove that the form of a state as eq .",

    "the successive reductions are smaller but still considerable , up to the step @xmath111 , which is the last we have considered in our calculations .",
    "it appears that different tasks may be achieved with our quantum control protocol simply choosing a different value of @xmath21 .",
    "for example , it is possible to choose @xmath112 , corresponding to the situation in which successive applications of the guidance protocol increase the purity of the qubit state leaving its overlap with @xmath95 unchanged .",
    "this realizes the purification of the qubit state for a given amount of entanglement shared between the qubits .",
    "this semi - quantitative analysis should have shown that genuine quantum control without any real feedback ( but just post - selection ) is performed , in this way .",
    "other possibilities are offered by a _",
    "dynamic adjustment _ of the interaction intervals , where the values of @xmath21 change at each iteration , in order to guide the state of the qubits toward a desired target state .",
    "however , it is obvious that such a procedure ( representing a true feedback scheme ) requires a much finer control on the dynamics of the setup .    * ( a ) *    the last step required to complete the analysis of the performances of our control protocol is a more direct comparison with the results achieved using the idealized procedure outlined in section  [ ideale ] .",
    "this may be done by contrasting the purity and entanglement of the qubit systems . as shown in fig .",
    "[ comparo ] .",
    "the evolution of @xmath103 , in the purity - entanglement plane , is shown ( from right to left ) by the star - shaped symbols for up to @xmath113 iterations .",

    ", the improvement in the degree of purity ( as well as the increases of the degree of entanglement ) becomes smaller even if the purification of the state and its entanglement concentration are still effective .",
    "the series of points we obtain on the purity - entanglement plane slowly approaches the state produced by the ideal scheme in section  [ ideale ] .",
    "the effect of the detection inefficiencies can be fully taken into account .",
    "it turns out that the use of non - ideal detectors is formally equivalent to the replacement @xmath115\\lambda(l)$ ] in eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) followed by the explicit recalculation of eq .",
    "( [ qubitevolution ] ) . following these lines",
    ", we find that , for efficiency of detection as small as @xmath116 , the mixedness of the qubit state is about @xmath117 larger than the case of perfect detectors , as it is shown in fig .",

    "[ inefficienze ] presents these results just for a rescaled time around @xmath49 , the same is true all along the relevant interaction times we have examined and for up to @xmath111 iterations of the control protocol .",

    "even if it is raised by the non - ideality of the photodetectors , the mixedness of the qubit state is , nevertheless , reduced at each further application of our procedure .",
    "it is thus clear that realistic inefficiencies at the detection step do not affect dramatically the guidance of the qubit state .",
    "we can continue the analysis that non - ideality has in the performance of this protocol addressing the problem of _ no - signaling _ at the detection step . as pointed out earlier",
    ", the original purification scheme  @xcite discards negative events in which the ancilla system is found in a state different from the bona fide one . in our protocol ,",

    "our question is about the effect of a missing coincidence with respect to the purity of the qubit state . to answer this question",
    ", we have simulated a sequence of two applications of the procedure .",
    "the first application is _ positive _ ( in the sense that a coincidence of detection is found ) while the second one is _ negative _ ( no signal at the detectors , which is formally described by the action of the operator @xmath118 ) .",

    "we have checked what happens to the qubit density matrix when the sequence of positive and negative events is inverted . in this case , the entanglement distillation process is no more effective , up to the second iteration .",
    "there is a very small increase in the overlap between the resulting qubit state and the target state @xmath95 .",
    "another evidence of the importance of the first iteration can be found looking for the asymptotic structure of the density matrix elements .",
