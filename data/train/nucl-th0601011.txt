    "quark model succeeds to classify the hundreds of baryons and mesons .",
    "a constituent quark model well reproduces the mass spectra of these hadrons using a colored interaction of one - gluon exchange ( oge ) type together with a phenomenological confinement potential  @xcite .",
    "there are of course those hadrons which do not fit the prediction of the constituent quark model , e.g. , @xmath9 ( roper resonance ) and @xmath10 .",
    "recently , motivated by a theoretical prediction for an exotic baryon  @xcite , some experimental groups have searched for it and reported the observation of @xmath0 which has baryon number @xmath11 , strangeness @xmath11 and a decay width of less than 25 mev  @xcite .",
    "its minimal quark content is @xmath12 , so it is often called a pentaquark baryon .",
    "a reason why the @xmath2 attracts much interest is that it is truly exotic , its mass is about 100 mev above the @xmath7 threshold , and its decay width appears to be very small nevertheless .",
    "the spin and parity of the @xmath2 has not yet been known , nor even the existence of the @xmath0 seems to be established experimentally  @xcite .",
    "the recent controversial status of the @xmath0 warrants a careful study of this system . from a theoretical side",
    "a calculation of the pentaquark mass and its decay width is useful and important .",
    "it was speculated that the @xmath2 is a bound state of two highly correlated @xmath13 pairs ( diquark ) and @xmath14  @xcite or it is a coupled system of a color antisymmetric @xmath13 diquark with a @xmath15 triquark  @xcite . in these models",
    "the spin and parity of the @xmath2 was assumed to be @xmath16 to account for its small decay width .",
    "some dynamical calculations of the mass of the @xmath2 for different @xmath17 states have been performed in constituent quark models  @xcite .",
    "the quark model usually predicts a smaller mass for the negative parity @xmath2 than for the positive parity @xmath2 .",
    "in fact the ground state of the @xmath2 is @xmath18 , but it was argued that the mass difference between the @xmath19 and @xmath20 states may become small or even be reversed for a certain type of flavor - spin dependent interactions acting between the quarks  @xcite . see a review article  @xcite for some theoretical attempts and problems which are discussed from a broad perspective .",
    "all the calculations performed so far in the constituent quark model were based on a variational principle which can be applied to a bound state problem . without giving a link between such a bound state calculation and a decay width , it is hard to quantify the width of the @xmath2 .",
    "though there are some attempts to predict the decay width of the @xmath2 in the constituent quark model  @xcite , either the unbound nature of the @xmath2 is not taken into account or the assumption of its structure is too simple .",
    "moreover , the correlated motion among the five quarks is usually truncated in the orbital , spin , isospin and color degrees of freedom or in some of them apart from a calculation  @xcite .",
    "for example , a treatment of hidden color components is not quite clear .",
    "though the colors of the quarks are uniquely coupled to a color singlet state in a baryon and a meson , we have several possibilities to get a color singlet pentaquark .",
    "therefore it is desirable to carefully examine the role of the hidden color states in a variational calculation .",
    "this problem is avoided in ref .",
    "@xcite by averaging a confinement potential .",
    "we will instead show that it is possible to predict the mass of the pentaquark even though the hidden color components are included in a calculation .",
    "a very recent quark model calculation with a scattering boundary condition  @xcite is perhaps the only one that has undertaken a prediction of the width of the @xmath2 .",
    "it is claimed there that a sharp resonance with @xmath19 appears above 2 gev , which is in disagreement with the other predictions  @xcite . in any case ,",
    "the appearance of such a narrow resonance is hard to understand unless the @xmath2 has negligibly small @xmath21 component .",
    "it is fair to say that the quark model study has not so far given a settled prediction for the decay width of the @xmath2 though it seems to predict more or less a similar mass for it .",
    "the purpose of this study is to predict the mass and the decay width of the @xmath2 in a few - body approach based on the quark model .",
    "we assume that the @xmath2 is a five - particle system but not a heptaquark system like @xmath22  @xcite , as discussed in @xcite .",
    "we calculate the mass and the width for some @xmath17 states assuming that the system has isospin 0 and is confined in a spatially small region .",
    "we pay a special attention to the unbound nature of the sought solution and perform a dynamical calculation which allows for not only spatial correlations among the quarks but also all possible spin - isospin - color configurations .",
    "the merit of employing the quark model is that it exploits the symmetry of the system and can test the validity of some models through the dynamical calculation . in this way , we can learn the extent to which the diquark model  @xcite or the diquark - triquark model  @xcite is sound . also our model can include the effect of @xmath21 and @xmath23 channels on the @xmath2 , which is vital to predict the width .",
    "we use a correlated gaussian basis and a complete set of the spin - isospin - color configurations . to predict the mass and decay width of the @xmath2",
    ", we use a real stabilization method  @xcite which utilizes square - integrable basis functions to localize the resonance .",
    "we use a stochastic variational method  @xcite ( svm ) to set up the basis set which describes resonance states .",
    "our emphasis here is not to include continuum states explicitly but to localize the resonance in a simple way , which makes it possible to calculate the reduced width .",
    "we believe that to evaluate the decay width is still a worthwhile study , considering the present controversial situation as mentioned above .",
    "the composition of the paper is as follows .",
    "our formalism is explained in sect .",

    "[ summary ] .",
    "a hamiltonian for the @xmath2 reads as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass of the @xmath26th quark and @xmath27 is the interaction potential between the quarks .",
    "the so - called natural units are used , so a length has a dimension of inverse energy ( 1 fm=@xmath28 mev@xmath29 ) .",
    "the kinetic energy of the quark is given in a nonrelativistic form and the kinetic energy of the center of mass motion , @xmath30 , is subtracted from the hamiltonian .",
    "the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian corresponds to the intrinsic mass of the @xmath2 .",
    "the quark - quark potential used in this paper consists of a variant of oge potential , a phenomenological confinement potential and a zero - point energy term .",
    "it is taken from literatures : al1 potential  @xcite @xmath31 with @xmath32 or ts potential  @xcite @xmath33 both potentials contain the color coulomb and color magnetic terms .",
    "@xmath34 are the color su(3 ) generators ( gell - mann matrices ) for the @xmath26th quark . in this paper an su(3 ) representation",
    "is labeled by elliott s convention  @xcite @xmath35 whose dimension is @xmath36 .",
    "a quark carries a color of ( 10 ) representation and an antiquark carries that of ( 01 ) representation .",
    "the color state of two quarks is either ( 20 ) ( color symmetric ) or ( 01 ) ( color antisymmetric ) .",
    "corresponding to these representations , the matrix of @xmath37 becomes @xmath38 for the case of a quark - antiquark pair the color state is either ( 11 ) or ( 00 ) , and the matrix of @xmath37 corresponding to these states is @xmath39 in cases where the two quarks are in the color state ( 20 ) or the quark - antiquark pair is in ( 11 ) , @xmath37 gives a sign opposite to the physical cases which appear in a baryon and a meson , so those color states play a role of deconfining the quarks at large distances",
    ". we will not exclude such color states , however , from the beginning as they may be important in the @xmath2 comprising four quarks and one antiquark in a spatially confined region .    for a color singlet system ,",
    "the zero - point energy term has an expectation value @xmath40 where the subgroup label of the color singlet state is denoted 000 , and where @xmath41 is the total number of quarks and antiquarks contained in the system and it determines the expectation value independently of the way of constructing the color state .",
    "thus the zero - point energies of the al1 potential are @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , for mesons , baryons and the @xmath2 , respectively . in the case of the ts potential , @xmath45 is varied depending on @xmath41 : @xmath46 for the meson , @xmath47 for the baryon , and @xmath48 for the @xmath2 . to change the parameter of the zero - point energy results in simply shifting the mass but",
    "never alters the eigenfunction of the hamiltonian .",
    "this property will be used in sect .",
    "[ decay ] to estimate the decay width of the @xmath2 .",
    "we list in table  [ tab.baryon-meson ] the masses of some mesons and baryons calculated using the svm  @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the potential are also given in the table .",
    "it is found that both potentials give the results which agree reasonably well with the observed masses of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath7 threshold is 1486 and 1451 mev for the al1 and ts potentials , respectively .",
    "the masses of the strange baryons predicted with the ts potential are considerably large compared to the experiment , which is probably due to the fact that the mass of the strange quark is taken to be large .",
    "the masses of some baryons such as @xmath9 and @xmath10 are found to be too large . a flavor - dependent potential or some multi - quark configurations",
    "may be needed to reproduce these masses  @xcite . the root mean square ( rms ) radius of the quark distribution is also calculated and listed in the table . the calculated size of @xmath51 is apparently too small ,",

    "we have studied the mass and the decay width of the @xmath2 consisting of @xmath12 quarks in the constituent quark model .",
    "the quarks are assumed to interact via a variant of the one - gluon exchange potential plus a phenomenological confinement potential which reproduce the masses of e.g. , @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 reasonably well .",
    "the five - quark states are described using the correlated gaussian basis together with the general spin - isospin - color wave functions .",
    "the basis functions are set up with the stochastic variational method .",
    "one of the advantages of the present approach is that the importance of all the possible color configurations can be tested , so that the hidden color components are naturally taken into account in the calculation .",
    "we have performed coupled - channels calculations to predict the @xmath2 masses for @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "the @xmath21 and @xmath23 channels are explicitly included as they are expected to be important to obtain the decay width .",
    "the real stabilization method is successfully used to locate the resonance in the continuum states above the @xmath7 threshold .",
    "the ground state is found to be @xmath18 and its mass is about 2 gev , which is 500 - 600 mev higher than the observed value .",
    "the first and second excited states are @xmath5 and @xmath79 . the color magnetic and kinetic energy terms of the hamiltonian are the most important pieces which contribute to this level ordering .    to estimate the decay width of the @xmath2",
    ", we have used the @xmath80-matrix theory in which most crucial is the reduced width amplitude for the relevant decay channel .",
    "the decay channel is specified by the angular momentum @xmath81 , the addition of the spins of the baryon and the meson , as well as the relative orbital angular momentum @xmath82 between them .",
    "the calculated decay width is the @xmath83 decay with @xmath84 for @xmath18 and @xmath85 for @xmath86 , respectively . for the @xmath2 with @xmath87 , the decay to the @xmath83 channel",
    "is forbidden because the corresponding reduced width amplitude vanishes , so the decay width to the @xmath6 channel is calculated .",
    "all the reduced width amplitudes are small compared to the wigner limit value . as the mass of the @xmath2 is very large compared to the threshold , the decay width becomes very broad except for the @xmath5 state whose decay width to the @xmath6 channel is only a few mev .",
    "we have also estimated the decay width by shifting the calculated mass to the observed mass , i.e. , 100 mev above the @xmath88 threshold .",
    "this shift causes no change in the resonance wave functions .",
    "the possibility that the observed state is @xmath18 is ruled out because its width is still too large .",
    "the case that it is either @xmath5 or @xmath4 appears not to be inconsistent with the observation of the small width .",
    "however , in both cases other pentaquark state with different @xmath17 is expected to exist below the observed one at 1540 mev .",
    "its experimental confirmation will give us a support for the @xmath2 .",
    "the structure of the @xmath89 states is discussed through the density distributions of @xmath13 and @xmath14 quarks as well as the two - particle correlation functions of the quarks .",
    "it is found that the @xmath90 quark has a narrower distribution near the center of mass of the @xmath91 quarks than the @xmath13 quark .",
    "the average @xmath92-@xmath92 distance is longer compared to that of @xmath92-@xmath90 .",
    "these characteristics can be understood from the fact that the @xmath92-@xmath93 interaction is stronger than the @xmath92-@xmath92 interaction .",
    "we have decomposed the resonance wave function into various components using the diquark - diquark model and the baryon - meson model .",
    "the baryon - meson configuration of the karliner - lipkin model is in fact a main component in the @xmath18 state but not an important component in the @xmath94 state , differing from its expectation .",
    "in contrast to this , the diquark - diquark configuration of the jaffe - wilczek model occupies the largest component in the @xmath94 state as expected , but its magnitude is not very large .",
