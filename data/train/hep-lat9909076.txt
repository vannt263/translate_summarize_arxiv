    "we are studying the semileptonic decays @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and the corresponding decays with a strange spectator quark . for a companion study of purely leptonic decays , see @xcite . the ckm matrix element @xmath5 , for example",
    ", is obtained from the differential semileptonic decay rate for @xmath6 at total leptonic four - momentum @xmath7 @xcite : @xmath8 the unknown hadronic form factor @xmath9 is to be determined in lattice gauge theory from the matrix element of the weak vector current @xmath10 , @xmath11",
    "since the heavy - light meson decays involve light quarks , it is important to choose an @xmath12 lattice fermion implementation with good chiral properties . to this end",
    "we have been experimenting with an action proposed by degrand , hasenfratz , and kovcs @xcite , which introduces , in effect , a cutoff - dependent form factor at the quark - gluon vertex to suppress lattice artifacts at the level of the cutoff .",
    "the action is the usual clover action but with a gauge background constructed by replacing the usual gauge links by ape - smoothed links @xcite with coefficient @xmath13 for the forward link and @xmath14 for the sum of staples .",
    "the smoothed link is projected back to su(3 ) . this smoothing process is repeated @xmath15 times . for the present experiment",
    "we take @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "these values are to be kept constant in the continuum limit , thus giving the local continuum fermion action .",
    "this `` fattening '' process reduces problems with `` exceptional '' configurations that obstruct extrapolations to light quark mass @xcite .",
    "calculations were done on an archive of 200 @xmath18 gauge configurations , generated with two flavors of dynamical staggered quarks of mass @xmath19 at the one - plaquette coupling @xmath20 , corresponding to a lattice spacing ( from the rho mass ) of about 0.11 fm .",
    "the fat clover propagator was generated for three `` light '' ( spectator and recoiling ) quarks and five `` heavy '' ( decaying and recoiling ) quarks over a mass range @xmath21 .",
    "the coefficient of the clover term @xmath22 was set to 1 .",
    "the mass of the lightest fat clover quark was adjusted to give the same pion mass as the staggered fermion goldstone boson .",
    "we use the fermilab program through @xmath23 for the quark wave function normalization , including the three - dimensional rotation@xcite with coefficient @xmath24 .",
    "the light meson source is placed at @xmath25 and the heavy - light meson at @xmath26 , with antiperiodic boundary conditions in @xmath27 .",
    "we treat three values of the heavy - light - meson momentum and 21 values of the three - momentum transfer at the current vertex .",
    "computations are in progress .",
    "results are presented for a subset of about half of the 200 configurations including only the two lightest spectator quark masses .",
    "an example of the meson dispersion relation is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : disp_rel ] .",
    "it is quite satisfactory .",
    "the form factor is extracted by amputating the external meson legs  at present , by dividing by @xmath28 $ ] , where the @xmath29 meson energy @xmath30 and recoil meson energy @xmath31 are taken from central values of a fit to the corresponding two - point dispersion relations .",
    "the diagonal vector form factor at zero three - momentum transfer gives the vector current renormalization factor @xmath32 .",
    "it is shown as a function of the inverse meson mass in fig .",
    "[ fig : z_v ] for the two currently available choices of the spectator quark mass .",
    "we see that this nonperturbative renormalization constant is within @xmath33% of unity .",
    "we test the soft pion theorem @xcite which states that in the chiral limit @xmath34 .",
    "the same action and configurations are used to get @xmath35 @xcite .",
    "both spectator and recoil quark masses ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) are extrapolated to zero .",
    "if we use @xmath38 = a + bm + cm^\\prime$ ] we obtain fig .",
    "[ fig : soft_pion2 ] , a disagreement similar to that found by jlqcd @xcite .",
    "if we include an extra term @xmath39 as advocated by maynard @xcite the theorem is satisfied , but with large extrapolated errors .",
    "we hope our eventual full data sample will help resolve these complexities @xcite .",
    "sample form factors for the process @xmath40 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs_to_k ] .",
    "fattening has allowed us to obtain results for an ostensibly @xmath12 action on unquenched lattices for quark masses at least as low as @xmath41 with no noticeable trouble from exceptional configurations .",
    "our experiment raises a number of important questions : will a one - loop - perturbative determination of current renormalization factors be adequate ? how much fattening is good ?",
    "does fattening push us farther from the continuum limit for some quantities ?",
    "work is in progress .",
