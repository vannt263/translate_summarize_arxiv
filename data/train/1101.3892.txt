    "the coupling of electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is at the core of the physics of nanoelectromechanical systems ( nems)@xcite .",
    "pronounced vibrational effects in electronic transport have been observed in several recent experiments on molecules  @xcite and single wall carbon nanotube quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "stimulated by the experimental works , several groups  @xcite have attempted to theoretically explain some features of the measured stability diagrams ( i.e. , of the differential conductance in a bias voltage - gate voltage colour map ) which appear to be ubiquitous . specifically , one observes the following : ( i ) equidistant lines run parallel to the edges of the coulomb diamonds .",
    "( ii ) the probed diamonds show often negative differential conductance ( ndc ) features appearing between excited vibronic states .",
    "( iii ) this corresponds to a sequence of peaks in the current as a function of the bias voltage .",
    "the height of the peaks measured in ref .   was found to be in quantitative agreement with predictions of a simple franck - condon model for a single electronic level coupled to a harmonic mode ( the so called anderson - holstein model )  @xcite .",
    "the ndc features have been explained in ref .   in terms of local vibronic excitations . in ref .",
    "ndc features are associated with the anderson - holstein model at a single vibronic resonance , while in ref .",
    "ndcs appear due to the electron - phonon - coupling - induced selective unidirectional cascades of single - electron transitions . in a recent work",
    "@xcite , carbon nanotube - specific ndc features have been attributed to a spatially dependent franck - condon factor and to the presence of quasidegenerate electronic levels , while in ref .",
    "an interference effect between the orbitally degenerate electronic states has been proposed . in refs .  ,  , and  , however , to see ndc some sort of asymmetry is required either in the coupling to the source and drain contacts or in the coupling to the two orbitally quasidegenerate states of the system or in both couplings at the same time .",
    "+ in this paper we extend these ideas and propose a generic model in which two degenerate or quasidegenerate molecular levels are coupled to many vibronic modes .",
    "we consider the case of a _ symmetric _ setup , i.e. , invariant under exchange of source with drain if simultaneously also the sign of the bias voltage is reversed .",
    "if the frequency @xmath1 of the @xmath0th mode is an @xmath0th multiple , @xmath2 , of the frequency @xmath3 of the fundamental mode , then several energetic degenerate vibronic configurations arise ( involving two or more modes ) which may contribute to transport at finite bias .",
    "+ as we are going to show in our paper , the additional presence of spin and/or orbital degeneracies opens the possibility of getting slow channels contributing to transport .",
    "as a consequence , ndc phenomena can occur despite a _ fully symmetric _",
    "quantum - dot setup .",
    "a peculiarity of the observed features is , in particular , an asymmetry with respect to the gate voltage in the stability diagrams .",
    "finally , we retain source - drain symmetry but allow for an asymmetry in the coupling to the two orbitally degenerate states .",
    "we show that this asymmetry is sufficient to explain the experimental observations ( i)-(iii ) .",
    "+ in some of the experiments  @xcite the slope of the ndc lines is the same for both positive and negative biases .",
    "this characteristic has been associated with the left and right asymmetry in the coupling to the leads  @xcite .",
    "we confirm that including the higher harmonics does not change the effect and give an analytical interpretation of the numerical results for low biases .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii the model hamiltonian of a single molecule coupled to several vibronic modes is introduced .",
    "a polaron transformation is employed to obtain the spectrum of the system in the presence of electron - vibron interactions . in turn , as known from the theory of franck - condon blockade in the simplest anderson - holstein model  @xcite , the polaron transformation also crucially affects the tunneling hamiltonian describing the coupling to the source and drain leads .",
    "iii the consequences on transport are analyzed .",
    "( i ) the tunneling transition amplitudes involve product of franck - condon factors with coupling constants depending on the mode number .",
    "( ii ) at low bias , such that only the lowest vibronic mode is excited , a description of the dynamics only in terms of rate equations involving occupation probabilities of the many - body states of the quantum dots is appropriate .",
    "( iii ) at higher bias , when several vibron modes are excited , a generalized master equation ( gme ) coupling diagonal ( populations ) and off - diagonal ( coherences ) elements of the quantum dot reduced density matrix should be used ( see e.g. , refs .  ) .",
    "iv our main results for the current - voltage characteristics in a fully symmetric setup are shown and analyzed .",
    "in particular , we give an explanation of the ndc features observed at low bias in terms of a different spin and orbital degeneracy of states with different electron numbers contributing to transport . in sec .",
    "v asymmetric setups are discussed as well .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "in the following we consider a generalized anderson - holstein model where the hamiltonian of the central system has the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 describes two quasidegenerate levels . the hamiltonian is modeled as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the orbital and @xmath8 is the spin degree of freedom .",

    ", then the configurations @xmath50 and @xmath51 have the same energy .",
    "for finite orbital mismatch , @xmath52 , the orbital degeneracy is broken . the case @xmath53 is illustrated in fig .  [ fig8](b ) .",
    "the corresponding states are : @xmath54 and @xmath55 , + @xmath56 .",
    "in this section we discuss the transport across the system under the assumption of weak coupling to the leads .",
    "the hamiltonian of the full system is described as @xmath57 where @xmath58 denote the source and the drain contact , respectively .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath59 is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the electron operator in the leads .",
    "finally , @xmath62 describes the influence of the externally applied gate voltage @xmath63 .",
    "the gate is capacitively coupled to the molecule and hence contributes via a term @xmath64 . in the case of high degeneracy of the spectrum ,",
    "the appropriate technique to treat the dynamics of the system in the weak coupling regime is the liouville equation method for the time evolution of the density matrix of the total system consisting of the leads and the generic quantum dot . to describe the electronic transport through the molecule",
    ", we solve the liouville equation @xmath65,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the reduced density matrix @xmath66 in the interaction picture , where the trace over the leads degrees of freedom is taken .",
    "we make the following standard approximations to solve the above equation : ( i ) the leads are considered as reservoirs of noninteracting electrons in thermal equilibrium .",
    "( ii ) we factorize the total density matrix as @xmath67 , where we assume weak coupling to the leads , and treat @xmath59 perturbatively up to second order .",
    "( iii ) being interested in long time properties , we make a markov approximation , where the time evolution of @xmath68 is only local in time .",
    "notice that in the regime of interest , @xmath69 , the markovian approximation becomes exact .",
    "( iv ) since the eigenstates @xmath70 of @xmath71 are known , it is convenient to calculate the time evolution of @xmath72 in this basis retaining coherences between degenerate states with the same number of particles .",
    "hence @xmath72 can be divided into block matrices @xmath73 , where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the energy and number of particles of the degenerate eigenstates @xmath76 .",
    "we obtain an equation of the bloch - redfield form + @xmath77 where the indices @xmath78 refer to the eigenstates of @xmath79 and @xmath80 runs over all degenerate states with fixed particle number .",

    "more explicitly : @xmath88 with @xmath89 and @xmath90 the electrochemical potential of the lead @xmath91 . likewise @xmath92 with @xmath93",
    "moreover , we introduced @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the fermi function while @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the bare transfer rates with the constant densities of states of the leads @xmath98 . knowing the stationary density matrix @xmath99 , the ( particle ) current through lead @xmath91 is determined by @xmath100 @xmath101 if the relation given by eq .",
    "holds , then spin and orbital degeneracies intrinsic in the electronic structure are supplemented by degeneracies related to the vibronic structure .",
    "several vibronic modes with frequencies @xmath102 multiples of the fundamental frequency @xmath103 give rise , in fact , naturally to several degenerate vibronic configurations .",
    "this is the situation we shall focus on in the rest of the paper .",
    "+ a degenerate spectrum is a necessary condition for the appearance of interference effects in the transport characteristics both in the linear and non linear regime @xcite and these effects can be captured only by considering not only populations ( diagonal elements ) but also coherences ( off - diagonal elements ) of the reduced density matrix .",
    "+ for the system at hand we calculated the current both with and without coherences between degenerate states up to five vibronic modes , obtaining though only quantitative but not qualitative differences .",
    "while spin and orbital degeneracies can be a priori excluded from the transport through a single molecule with nonpolarized leads@xcite , the role played by the vibronic coherences requires a more careful analysis .",
    "+ we have confirmed that it is not possible to construct a linear combination of degenerate states @xmath104 with finite transition amplitude to a state @xmath105 at one lead but decoupled from @xmath105 at the other lead , where @xmath105 and @xmath106 represent the states given by eq .  .",
    "this observation , complemented by the general method presented in ref .   proves the absence of interference blocking states in our system .",
    "thus , interference , even if present , does not have dramatic consequences on the transport characteristics of the system .",
    "+ all the current maps presented in the next section are hence , apart from fig .  [ fig6](b ) , calculated neglecting coherences . as shown explicitly in fig .",
    "[ fig6](b ) , this approximation does not affect qualitatively the results ( at least in the low bias regime ) .",
    "moreover , the negative differential conductance and the associated dynamical symmetry breaking that we present in the next section are not related to the interference and can thus be obtained by considering the dynamics of the populations alone .",
    "in this section , we illustrate our predictions for the transport characteristics and focus on the @xmath107 transitions . in the calculation we also assume for the coupling constant of the @xmath19 mode @xmath108 ( as expected for stretching modes in carbon nanotubes @xcite ) .",
    "the system is _ symmetrically _ coupled to source and drain contacts ( @xmath109 ) and the lowest five vibron modes are included .",
    "results for the differential conductance for different values of the dimensionless coupling constant @xmath110 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , obtained for zero and finite orbital mismatch @xmath111 , respectively",
    ".      when the orbital mismatch is zero , i.e. , @xmath113 , then the two orbital energies @xmath114 are the same . the minimum energy to produce",
    "a charge excitation is @xmath115 .",
    "we take the value of this energy as @xmath116 ( comparable to the level spacing energy of a suspended single wall carbon nanotube of @xmath117 length ) .",
    "furthermore , we assume the energy of the lowest vibronic mode to be @xmath118 .",
    "thus the charge excitation energy is much larger than the energy of the lowest vibron mode . indeed all the equidistant lines running parallel to the diamond edges observed in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are due to vibron excited states . what striking is the occurrence of negative differential conductance ( ndc ) features at moderate coupling ( @xmath119 and @xmath120 ) which , however , disappear when the coupling is increased ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "moreover , the ndc lines are only running parallel to one of the diamond edges , which indicates an asymmetry with respect to the gate voltage @xmath63 . as we are going to explain , at low bias , these features are a consequence of franck - condon assisted tunneling combined with the spin and/or orbital degeneracy in the system .",
    "specifically , let us focus on the low bias region [ see fig .",

    "<S> a theoretical model of a single molecule coupled to many vibronic modes is presented . at low energies , </S>",
    "<S> transport is dominated by electron - vibron processes where transfer of an electron through the dot is accompanied by the excitation or emission of quanta ( vibrons ) . </S>",
    "<S> because the frequency of the @xmath0th mode is taken as an @xmath0th multiple of the frequency of the fundamental mode , several energetically degenerate or quasidegenerate vibronic configurations can contribute to transport . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the consequences of strong electron - vibron coupling in a fully _ symmetric _ setup . </S>",
    "<S> several striking features are predicted . in particular , a gate - asymmetry and pronounced negative differential conductance features are observed . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute these features to the presence of slow channels originating from the interplay of franck - condon suppression of transport channels with spin and/or orbital degeneracies . </S>"
