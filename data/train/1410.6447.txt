    "in object localization , how to train the classifier and localize the objects is a chicken - and - egg problem @xcite .",
    "intuitively , if we know the locations of the objects , training a good classifier should be easier @xcite ; alternatively , if we have an ideal classifier , the higher scores of the classifier should distribute on or surrounding the objects , and localization should be easier .",
    "therefore , it is common to consider these two tasks jointly . given the spatial distribution of the classifier s score , finding the region that most probably containing object is known as region search problem @xcite .",
    "if we want to localize objects in a weakly - supervised manner , i.e. , the label of a training image is in the image level , the dependency between classifier training and object region searching will be even stronger .",
    "the classifiers are typically trained by adopting the standard bag - of - words representation and support vector machines ( svms ) , while the bottleneck is the region search . here",
    ", region search aims to find candidate regions according to the spatial distribution of svm scores . the popular sliding - window - based search , which exhaustively applies the classifier to rectangles within an image , is a natural way for region search .",
    "however , it is not efficient .",
    "many heuristics have been used to speed up the search procedure , but they also introduce the risk of imprecisely localizing the object or even missing it .",
    "many methods with global optimum and efficient solutions have been proposed to instead sliding window , here we name a few as representative ones .",

    "( c ) localization of ls - mwcs .",
    "the green region denotes the detection with level @xmath0 ( corresponds to ers @xcite ) . by increasing the level",
    ", the localization shrinks from the green region to blue and red regions .",
    "best viewed in color.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the efficient subwindow search ( ess ) is a remedy for sliding - window search @xcite .",
    "ess finds the rectangle that has the maximal score within an image .",
    "this turns out to be the 2d maximum subarray problem and the authors proposed an efficient branch - and - bound strategy to solve it .",
    "inspired by the great success of ess , many methods have been proposed to generalize the rectangle restriction in ess .",
    "for example , the rectangle was generalized to composite boxes and polygons in @xcite . the advantages of ess lie in that it is parameter - free , and there exist efficient algorithms to solve it .",
    "it also has certain limitations .",
    "( i ) if all projected scores are positive , ess will find the entire image to be the best subwindow .",
    "( ii ) ess can only find rectangular bounding boxes . for objects of non - rectangle shapes , noises in windows may mislead the localization , causing unsatisfactory results .    in order to find regions with arbitrary shapes , efficient region search ( ers ) @xcite",
    "was proposed for object localization .",
    "ers converts region search into the maximum - weight connected subgraph ( mwcs ) problem , and it can be equivalently transformed into an instance of the prize - collecting steiner tree ( pcst ) problem @xcite .",
    "pcst is an np - complete problem but has efficient approximation solutions @xcite .",
    "the localization ability of ers has been demonstrated in supervised classification framework . in @xcite ,",
    "an adaptive image grids scheme was proposed to improve ers by finding a better segmentation .",
    "ers is successful for supervised localization . however , if all projected scores are positive , it will also find the entire image to be the best region as that in ess .    besides ess and ers ,",
    "some region search methods are proposed for interactive segmentation .",
    "for example , twisted window search ( tws ) @xcite and shape from point features ( sff ) @xcite are proposed for interactive shape localization .",
    "sff use @xmath1-complex @xcite to build a filtration of simplicial complexes from a user - provided set of features .",
    "the densest complex connected component is viewed as the shape .",
    "sff is successful for interactive shape localization .",
    "however , it relies on the distinct weights manually labeled .",
    "empirically , it is not suitable for object localization because the projected weights from the classifier are usually very noisy compared to human interaction .",
    "the weakly - supervised object localization has higher demand for region search than supervised localization , since the distribution of projected scores is in general very noisy .",
    "the basic idea of our method is based on the following observation : although the spatial distribution of a classifier s scores seems to be random , the densest area of the score distribution is on or near the object , see fig .",
    "[ fig : demo](b ) for example . instead of finding the maximal score as done in ess and ers ,",
    "we attempt to search the regions with dense scores .",
    "the comparison of localization by densest score and maximal score is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : demo ] .",
    "our region search method is called * ls - mwcs ( level set maximum - weight connected subgraph ) * , which has the following two advantages : ( i ) it is able to localize regions of arbitrary shape ; ( ii ) it works well when all the weights are positive .",
    "the contribution of this paper is two - fold .",
    "first , we propose a region search method that can be used for very noisy weight distributions , such as for weakly - supervised localization .",
    "second , we validate the effectiveness of the densest score for region search , which in previous literatures is dominantly achieved by maximizing the score .",
    "region search is a key technology in weakly supervised localization ( wsl ) .",
    "wsl is usually modeled as multiple instance learning ( mil ) . in the mil",
    "setting , each image is modeled as a bag of regions , and each region is an instance . with two classes ,",
    "the negative bag only contains negative instances and the positive consists of at least one positive .",
    "the goal of mil is to label the positive instances in the positive bags .",
    "region search corresponds to finding the region ( instance ) in the positive image ( bag ) that triggers the positive label . in the past few years",
    ", many mil algorithms have been successfully used for weakly supervised learning , such as milboost @xcite and mi - svm @xcite . in @xcite , a region weighting method is proposed for wsl , which is customized for bag - of - words feature representation and non - linear svm classifiers .",
    "region search has a close relationship with common pattern discovery from images that share common contents , such as co - segmentation and image feature matching @xcite .",
    "there are two schemes for region search : one is based on feature points @xcite , and the other is based on super - pixels from over - segmentation @xcite . for methods based on feature points , it is difficult to localize regions that are consistent with the object boundaries .",
    "by contrast , localization methods based on super - pixels can guarantee the local consistency . in this paper",
    ", we focus on region search with super - pixels .    the effectiveness of ers has been validated for supervised localization , while its performance for weakly - supervised localization has not been reported .",
    "empirically , we found that ers has the following problem when it is directly used in weakly - supervised localization .",
    "the shape and area of the connected component found by ers can not be directly controlled . in weakly supervised localization ,",
    "since the positive weights are scattered over the entire image , ers tends to find spindly shapes that cover nearly the whole image .",
    "however , we find that the densest area of the score distribution is on or near the object , see fig .",
    "[ fig : demo ] . based on this observation ,",
    "in this section we will extend ers to find regions with densest scores .",
    "fist , we give some formal definition .",
    "the essence of ers is the maximum - weight connected subgraph ( mwcs ) problem , which is defined as follows .",
    "[ mwcs ] given a connected undirected , vertex - weighted graph @xmath2 with weights @xmath3 , find a connected subgraph @xmath4 of @xmath5 to maximize the score @xmath6 .",
    "we also define the density of a graph . in this paper",
    ", density means the average weight of a graph .",
    "[ density ] given a connected undirected , vertex - weighted graph @xmath2 with weights @xmath3 , the density is defined as @xmath7 , where@xmath8 means the node number of a graph .    in the region search problem",
    ", the set of vertices @xmath9 consists of the superpixels , and an edge in @xmath10 connects a pair of superpixels that share a boundary .",
    "the weight of a vertex @xmath11 is the superpixel s classifier score .",
    "the basic idea of ers @xcite is that the subgraph with maximal score corresponds to the localized object .",
    "since the mwcs problem aims to find a subgraph with maximum - weight , the density of the resulting subgraph can not be controlled . in order to control the density of a subgraph",
    ", we define the level set mwcs ( ls - mwcs ) based on the definition of mwcs . as will be shown in theorem 1 , it has a close relationship with the density of the resulting subgraph .",
    "[ lsmwcs ] given a connected undirected , vertex - weighted graph @xmath2 with weights @xmath3 , the mwcs with level @xmath1 aims to find a connected subgraph @xmath4 of @xmath5 , that maximizes the score @xmath12 .    based on the definition of ls - mwcs problem",
    ", we find the relationship between level @xmath1 and the density of resulting subgraph .",
    "this property turns out to be very useful for density - based region search .",
    "[ theorem1 ] denote the mwcs of a graph with level @xmath13 and @xmath14 as @xmath15 and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "suppose @xmath17 , then ( i ) the node number satisfies @xmath18 ; ( ii ) the weight summation satisfies @xmath19 ; ( iii ) if @xmath20 , then graph density satisfies @xmath21 .",
    "\\(i ) since @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the mwcs with level @xmath13 and @xmath14 , by definition  [ lsmwcs ] we have @xmath22 by adding the above two inequalities , we get @xmath23 . since @xmath24 , the inequality @xmath18 holds .",
    "\\(ii ) reformulate inequality   as @xmath25 . since we have proved that @xmath18 , it is obvious that @xmath19 holds .",
    "\\(iii ) according to inequality  , we have @xmath26 we have proved that @xmath18 and we suppose @xmath27 , so the inequality still holds when we divide the left expression with @xmath28 and divide the right expression with @xmath29 .",
    "according to theorem  [ theorem1 ] , when we increase the level @xmath1 , the node number and weight summation of the resulting subgraph is monotonically decreasing and the density of the subgraph is monotonically increasing . fig .",
    "[ fig : illumi ] gives an example .",
    "[ fig : illumi](a ) is a graph with @xmath30 vertices and @xmath31 edges , the weights are labeled in corresponding nodes . according to definition  [ mwcs ] , it is easy to verify that its mwcs is subgraph @xmath32 , where the node number , weight summation and density are @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 respectively . if the weights of all the nodes minus @xmath36 , we get a new graph as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : illumi](b ) .",
    "the mwcs of this new graph is subgraph @xmath37 . according to definition  [ lsmwcs ] ,",
    "the ls - mwcs with level @xmath36 is constructed as following : the node and edge are the same as the subgraph @xmath37 and the corresponding node weights are derived from the original graph .",
    "so the node number , weight summation and density of ls - mwcs are @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively .    theorem  [ theorem1 ] provides a theoretical background for finding dense subgraph .",
    "an interesting discovery in theorem  [ theorem1 ] is that the weight summation of the generated subgraph is monotonically decreasing with the level @xmath1 .",
    "this is useful in practice .",
    "for example , if we want to find the dense subgraph with predefined weight summation , we can use the binary search to find the proper level @xmath1 .",
    "when the level @xmath1 in ls - mwcs is determined , this problem can be easily converted to the standard mwcs problem .",
    "the mwcs problem is np - complete .",
    "fortunately , it can be transformed into an instance of the prize - collecting steiner tree ( pcst ) problem , as shown in @xcite , which can be efficiently solved in practice for our problem setting ( @xmath41 nodes , @xmath42 edges ) . in this paper",
    "we adopt an efficient belief propagation scheme to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "there is only one parameter , the level @xmath1 , for the problem of ls - mwcs .",
    "the level controls the density of the generated subgraph . by increasing @xmath1",
    ", we can obtain the subgraph which has denser weights and vice versa . for ls - mwcs based region search in the paper",
    ", this parameter is very useful when the projected classifier scores are all positive , such as hough transform vote @xcite and matrix completion multi - label classifiers @xcite .    generally , the selection of level @xmath1 is task - dependent .",
    "here we provide three strategies for the selection of @xmath1 .",
    "first , the level @xmath1 can be determined by a predefined node number , weight summation or graph density .",
    "second , we can find an optimal level that has best performance for a specific task that depends on level @xmath1 .",
    "take region search for weakly - supervised localization as an example , the optimal level @xmath1 can be set as the number producing the highest image classification accuracy by cross - validation .",
    "third , we can find @xmath1 that corresponds to stable subgraphs . here",
    "the notation of stable is similar to that in the definition of maximally stable extremal regions ( mser ) @xcite .",
    "a connect subgraph is stable if its weight summation does not change too much when the level @xmath1 is slightly changed .",
    "the efficient solution of stable subgraph is based on the fact that the weight summation is a monotonically decreasing function with level @xmath1 , as proved in theorem  1 .",
    "in this section , we present the experiments of our density - based region search , including experiments on synthetic data and image datasets .      fig .  [",

    "the weights of the nodes are 2d gaussian distribution with noise .",

    "similar to @xcite , we use a scheme of iterated optimization for classifier construction and region search .",
    "the dataset used in this experiment is pittsburgh car dataset @xcite , which contains @xmath45 images , including @xmath46 positive samples and @xmath46 negative samples .",
    "there is only one car in each positive sample .",
    "half of the positive and negative samples are used as training data , and the rest are used for testing",
