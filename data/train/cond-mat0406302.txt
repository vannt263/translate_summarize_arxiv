    "in the theory of low - dimensional magnetism the essential role of quantum and thermal fluctuations , especially in the description of magnetic short - range order ( sro ) at arbitrary temperatures , is of basic interest .",

    "@xcite thereby , the magnetization @xcite and the spin lattice relaxation rate @xcite were calculated .",
    "the 1d ferromagnet was studied by the bethe - ansatz method , where some exact data for the zero - field magnetic susceptibility and specific heat @xcite as well as for the magnetization and correlation length were given .",
    "@xcite recently , in the 1d model a power law for the shift of the temperature of the susceptibility maximum with the field was reported and argued from landau s theory to appear in the 2d model , too .",
    "@xcite therefore , a detailed analysis of the thermodynamic quantities of the 1d and 2d heisenberg ferromagnets as functions of temperature and field is of interest , also for comparison with experiments .",

    ", we adapt the greens - function projection method dealing with second time derivatives of spin operators outlined in refs .  .",
    "furthermore , we perform exact finite - lattice diagonalizations ( ed ) on an @xmath16 chain and an @xmath17 square lattice using periodic boundary conditions .    the exact bethe - ansatz results for the 1d case are obtained from an eigenvalue analysis of the quantum transfer matrix of the heisenberg chain , a concept that is also the basis of the work reported in ref .  . here , unlike the treatment in ref .",
    ", we perform this analysis by solving a certain set of nonlinear integral equations to be found for instance in ref .  .",
    "these integral equations were analysed in the literature extensively for the antiferromagnetic heisenberg chain .",
    "the ferromagnetic case satisfies the same set of equations with just a sign change in the temperature dependent term . despite this rather minor change in the analytical formulation",

    "[ fig_1 ] , the finite - size effects in the 2d model are more pronounced than in the 1d model .",

    "<S> we present a second - order greens - function theory of the one- and two - dimensional @xmath0 ferromagnet in a magnetic field based on a decoupling of three - spin operator products , where vertex parameters are introduced and determined by exact relations . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse and longitudinal spin correlation functions and thermodynamic properties ( magnetization , isothermal magnetic susceptibility , specific heat ) are calculated self - consistently at arbitrary temperatures and fields . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , exact diagonalizations on finite lattices and , in the one - dimensional case , exact calculations by the bethe - ansatz method for the quantum transfer matrix are performed . </S>",
    "<S> a good agreement of the greens - function theory with the exact data , with recent quantum monte carlo results , and with the spin polarization of a @xmath1 quantum hall ferromagnet is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the field dependences of the position and height of the maximum in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility are found to fit well to power laws , which are critically analyzed in relation to the recently discussed behavior in landau s theory . as revealed by the spin correlation functions and the specific heat at low fields </S>",
    "<S> , our theory provides an improved description of magnetic short - range order as compared with the random phase approximation . in one dimension and at very low fields , two maxima in the temperature dependence of the specific heat </S>",
    "<S> are found . </S>",
    "<S> the bethe - ansatz data for the field dependences of the position and height of the low - temperature maximum are described by power laws . at higher fields in one and two dimensions , the temperature of the specific heat maximum linearly increases with the field . </S>"
