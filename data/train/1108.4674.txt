    "multiples correspond to unwanted coherent events related to wave field reflection bounces on given surfaces .",
    "we refer to the comprehensive survey in @xcite for a detailed description .",
    "their attenuation @xcite represents one of the greatest challenges in past and present seismic processing , since the january 1948 issue of geophysics .",
    "their processing mainly relies on two types of approaches : ( 1 ) primary / multiple discrimination based on different velocities and reflections and ( 2 ) periodicity and predictability .",
    "the first approach maps data to a transformed domain with minimum overlap between primaries and multiples . transformed domain filters subsequently attenuate multiples or select primaries of interest .",
    "the filtered data is finally mapped back to data domain , using an appropriate inverse transform .",
    "common tools include stacking combined with normal move out ( nmo ) , homomorphic filtering @xcite , @xmath0 @xcite , and @xmath1 representations @xcite , or alternative breeds  parabolic , hyperbolic  of the radon transform @xcite , with pros & cons discussion in @xcite .",
    "the second approach includes prediction filters and variations thereof @xcite , also termed identification , updating , shaping , sequential or matching filters in electrical engineering literature @xcite or predictive deconvolution @xcite .",
    "recently , modeling based techniques , such as surface - related multiple estimation ( srme ) , have demonstrated excellent performance , allowing data - driven multiple removal @xcite or model - driven , wave - equation based , multiple removal @xcite .",
    "these methods , based on multiple models , consist in predicting then subtracting multiple events from original seismic data .    to compensate for mismatches , an adaptive subtraction is usually performed @xcite ;",
    "however , more direct subtraction , for instance when formulated as an inverse problem , is possible ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the adapted model is commonly obtained through a linear wiener - type filter @xcite that minimizes the energy of the difference between data and model .",
    "although primaries and multiples , generated from the same source , are not fully uncorrelated , or orthogonal , least square error ( lse ) solutions are widespread , mainly due to their computational simplicity . to reduce the distortion of primaries due to their cross - correlation with multiples ,",
    "these matching filters are usually applied in two steps in practical cases .",
    "long filters compensate global amplitude , waveform and time - shift differences , then shorter filters correct time variant discrepancies .    the observation on primaries and multiples cross - correlation leads to more hybrid methods , mixing both transform and prediction approaches .",
    "improvements may reside in different strategies . either the use of more robust objective matching criteria than lse based ones , such as those based on the @xmath2 norm @xcite , or independence - based subtraction @xcite are efficient alternatives .",
    "simultaneous estimation of sets of filters based on a broader quantity of information is another option , e.g. , in multichannel adaptation @xcite .",
    "a suitable data representation may further serve adaptive subtraction ( @xcite with radial suppression , @xcite with focal transform ) .",
    "a recent trend focuses on multiscale or wavelet - like approaches @xcite , which may better promote sparsity in exploiting slight differences in primaries and multiple spectra .",
    "@xcite use standard discrete wavelet transforms .",
    "@xcite follow a twist towards curvelets , sometimes regarded as a local multiscale radon transform @xcite .    in many cases , the choice of the type and length of the matching filter , whatever the domain , needs careful parameter selection and testing , and requires computational resources .",
    "with our method , we aim at overcoming this issue by decomposing a complicated wide - band problem into a set of more tractable narrow - band problems , through a wavelet transform . in the proposed approach , model - based multiple removal",
    "is solely based on 1d traces , and hence does not compete directly with higher dimensional @xcite , regularized @xcite or robust approaches @xcite .",
    "more precisely , comparing with existing literature , we retain the following three concepts : 1 ) non - stationary wiener matching filters @xcite , 2 ) complex trace processing @xcite , 3 ) continuous wavelet frames @xcite .",
    "the adopted complex morlet wavelet frame emulates limited - scale complex derivatives @xcite .",
    "the adaptation in the wavelet domain is performed at each scale with a complex `` unary '' filter , e.g. , a one - coefficient matching operator @xcite , accounting for localized phase and amplitude variations between data and model .",
    "the flexible redundancy and the `` complex trace '' effect of this wavelet frame allow a better management of time variability in model misalignment errors , at the price of a less intuitive interpretation of the designed subtraction operator , due to the complex interplay between unary filters and wavelet decomposition .",
    "the complex curvelet method , proposed by @xcite , can be viewed as performing unary wiener filtering in a complex - valued curvelet domain . with the proposed algorithm",
    ", we aim at a better understanding of the intricate relationship between a sparsifying transform and its associated matched filtering .",
    "its flexibility both resides in choices for a quasi - analytic wavelet and its scale discretization , to better adapt variations in data character and sampling .",
    "the algorithm alleviates some constraints of the curvelets ( either real or complex ) such as a relatively high memory footprint and its fixed dyadic frequency decomposition .",
    "however , as strictly 1d , it does not capitalize the information given by neighboring traces . despite this ,",
    "the closed - form of the matching filter may be beneficial in keeping low complexity , computational speed and possible parallelization .",
    "being nevertheless rather competitive to 2d techniques , it may fit sparsely or non - uniformly sampled datasets .",
    "a classical 1d trace observation model is : @xmath3=p[n]+m[n]+w[n]\\,,\\label{eq : signals_definition}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 $ ] , @xmath5 $ ] , @xmath6 $ ] and @xmath7 $ ] denote the recorded data , primary events , multiples and background noise , respectively , at discrete time index @xmath8 .",
    "we perform a time - scale decomposition of each data @xmath4 $ ] and multiple model @xmath9 $ ] traces with discrete wavelet frame approximations to continuous wavelet transform ( cwt ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite and references therein for comparison between discrete and continuous wavelet transforms .",
    "we choose the complex morlet wavelet since it yields a simple interpretation of amplitude and phase delay in the transformed domain .",
    "the mother morlet wavelet is approximately analytic and writes:@xmath10 where @xmath11 is the central frequency of the modulated gaussian , @xmath12 denoting the continuous time variable . a standard choice of @xmath13 for the central frequency halves side - lobe amplitude with respect to the main lobes .",
    "the associated discrete family of functions is defined as a sampling of the mother wavelet : @xmath14=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2^{j+v / v}}}\\psi\\!\\left(\\frac{nt - r2^{j}b_{0}}{2^{j+v / v}}\\right)\\ , , \\label{eq : wavelet_family}\\ ] ] with @xmath15 the sampling rate and @xmath16 the number of voices per octave .",

    "finally , @xmath19 stands for the sampling period at scale zero , @xmath20 . its redundancy , of approximately @xmath21 , may be adapted to the expected computational efficiency .",
    "the time - scale representation of trace @xmath4 $ ] , for instance , is given by the inner product : @xmath22,\\psi_{r , j}^{v}[n]\\right\\rangle = \\sum_{n}d[n]\\overline{\\psi_{r , j}^{v}[n]}\\,,\\label{eq : dwt}\\ ] ] and written in bold , with indices dropped for more generality , accounting for the whole trace , or a windowed portion of it .",
    "windowing in time - scale domain improves the localization in complex unary filters estimation .",
    "expression @xmath23}$ ] denotes the complex conjugate of @xmath24 $ ] .",
    "suppose @xmath25 results from some time - scale correction or processing of @xmath26 , here model matching and subtraction .",
    "then the resulting filtered trace is synthesized back to the time domain as a sum of the dual frame components , @xmath27 $ ] , @xmath28=\\sum_{r}\\sum_{j , v}\\hat{d}_{r , j}^{v}\\widetilde { \\psi}_{r , j } ^{v}[n ] \\,,\\label{eq : ifwt}\\ ] ] weighted by the corrected signal @xmath29 , for instance here with multiples subtracted .",
    "illustrations of corresponding time - scale raw and processed data are provided in @xcite . with sufficient redundancy , @xmath30",
    "$ ] can be approximated by @xmath31 $ ] up to a constant multiplicative factor ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the discriminative power of the wavelet frame helps reformulate the design of a long matching filter into combined global and local optimum complex unary filters , minimizing the error between multiple events and their matched model .",
    "the straightforward group - delay estimation allowed by morlet wavelets , together with frame redundancy , helps avoiding reconstruction artifacts observed with non - redundant discrete wavelet processing @xcite .      when the group delay difference between model and multiple sequences is less than half a period at all scales , it can be corrected in the time - scale domain following an lse approach .",
    "the optimum unary filter at a given wavelet scale , either in local or global windowed portions of the trace , is defined as the complex scalar @xmath32 which , multiplied by the time - scale decomposed multiple model @xmath33 , minimizes the mean square error @xmath34 with the decomposed input dataset @xmath26:@xmath35 where the phase of @xmath36 compensates small delays .",
    "this method is efficient , provided the above small group delay condition is satisfied @xcite .",
    "otherwise , i.e. , when the cross - correlation peak departs from the zero delay sample , faulty @xmath36 estimation in equation [ eq : min_criterium ] requires a redesign of the filter .",
    "two options can be conceived to add robustness against high fractional delays , while keeping with the unary filter approach : either to design filters with a high group delay , or to add a gross group delay correction first and then to apply the previous unary filter for fine group delay correction .",
    "in contrast with the fourier transform , wavelets fast decay strongly limits the maximum group delay correction on the first option .",
    "hence , we focus exclusively on the second one . however , high group delay filters enable a relatively simple scale - wise unary filter design , that could reinforce matching in noisy scenarios , in applications where the specifications of group - delay range are smaller than the effective time support of the chosen wavelets .",
    "we thus introduce a delay term into the above unary filter to yield higher delay robustness , while keeping an lse criterion .",
    "this amounts to finding optimum @xmath32 and delay @xmath37 that minimize : @xmath38-a_{j}^{v}x_{j}^{v}[r - l]\\right|^{2}=\\left\\vert \\mathbf{d}-a\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\vert ^{2}\\,,\\label{eq : mmse_withdelay}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes a delay of @xmath33 by @xmath37 samples , sequences @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 $ ] are complex and the @xmath42 symbol denotes a locally weighted sum along odd @xmath43 consecutive samples around index @xmath44 .",
    "we opt to drop all subscripts for @xmath36 for clarity .",
    "it is understood that this algorithm may be applied either locally or globally , depending on problem constraints .    for a given delay @xmath37 ,",
    "optimum @xmath36 yields orthogonality between filtered signal @xmath45 and adapted model @xmath46 , which writes in inner product form as:@xmath47 by developing and applying linearity on the first argument and conjugate linearity on the second one , we obtain : @xmath48 and therefore@xmath49=\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\vert \\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\vert ^{2}}=\\frac{\\sum_{r}d_{j}^{v}[r]\\overline{x_{j}^{v}[r - l]}}{\\sum_{r}\\left|x_{j}^{v}[r - l]\\right|^{2}}\\,,\\label{eq : mmse_aopt}\\ ] ] i.e. , the unary wiener filter solution for complex signals .",
    "note that instead of performing a direct measurement of the fractional delay , or equivalently of the group delay , we estimate the phase delay at each scale or frequency component . when the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) is high , all meaningful phase components are sufficiently well estimated .",
    "however , when the s / n decreases , moderate phase errors made at key scale components may induce huge errors on group delay . as a consequence",
    ", we have to ensure that the phase of @xmath36 varies smoothly in scale for important components .",
    "several criteria , well adapted to the nature of the seismic signals , can be chosen in the selection of the optimum delay . the optimum integer delay , in lse sense ,",
    "is selected among all sub - optimal @xmath50 $ ] as the one minimizing @xmath51 : @xmath52)\\,.\\label{eq : intdelay_mmse}\\ ] ] alternatively , due to the importance of waveform over amplitude , we can define the optimum delay as the one that maximizes the normalized cross - correlation between the adapted model and the data , commonly called coherence @xcite,@xmath53\\label{eq : intdelay_coh}\\ ] ] being @xmath54=\\textrm{re}\\left[\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},a_{\\textrm{opt}}[l]\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\vert \\mathbf{d}\\right\\vert \\left\\vert a_{\\textrm{opt}}[l]\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\vert } \\right]\\,,\\label{eq : intdelay_nxcorr}\\ ] ] where we focus on the real part of the normalized cross - correlation .",
    "the use of unary filters enables two important simplifications of the previous equations . applying conjugate linearity in the second argument of the inner product and positive scalability of the norm gives:@xmath55}}{\\left|a_{\\textrm{opt}}[l]\\right|}\\frac{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\rangle } { \\left\\vert \\mathbf{d}\\right\\vert \\left\\vert \\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\vert } \\right]\\,.\\label{eq : nxcorr_simpl}\\ ] ]",
    "namely , the normalized cross - correlation between the adapted model and the data only depends on the phase of the optimum unary filter and the normalized cross - correlation between the original model and the data .",
    "slighty better results can be obtained with an independent fine selection of the window functions used in the estimation of the unary filter and the normalized cross - correlation , equations [ eq : mmse_aopt ] and [ eq : intdelay_nxcorr ] . however",
    ", even more important to us , when these weighted sums are chosen equal , the normalized cross - correlation of the corrected sequence is equivalent to the cosine of the angle between @xmath26 and @xmath39 .",
    "this can be shown noticing that @xmath56}/\\left|a_{\\textrm{opt}}[l]\\right|$ ] can be written depending on @xmath26 and @xmath39 from its definition in equation [ eq : mmse_aopt],@xmath57}}{\\left|a_{\\textrm{opt}}[l]\\right|}=\\frac{\\overline{\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\rangle } } { \\left|\\left\\langle \\mathbf{d},\\mathbf{x}_{l}\\right\\rangle \\right|}\\:.\\label{eq : phase_aopt}\\ ] ] as a consequence , the normalized cross - correlation is totally independent of the optimum unary filter in this particular case,@xmath58 and the coherence value measured is always real and positive .",
    "when no window is used , this criterion reduces to maximum cross - correlation between data and predicted multiples .",
    "this configuration enables an important reduction on the computational cost when the normalized cross - correlation estimator is used , as it enables a direct estimation of the optimum integer delay , without having to estimate the optimum unary filter for each candidate .",
    "concisely , we first gauge an integer delay , equation [ eq : nxcorr_aopt - indep ] , to rectify large time shifts ; we then estimate the optimum unary filter , equation [ eq : mmse_aopt ] , to shrink amplitude and remaining delay differences .",

    "however , a dataset showing single primary and multiple events with identical wavelet shape is not completely realistic . in practice",
    ", variations in wavelet shapes associated with uncorrelated time arrivals of primaries and multiple greatly contribute to the success of adaptation in a given time frame .",
    "thus , better behavior of the proposed algorithm on actual data is expected .",
    "firstly , it enhances primaries and multiples discrepancies in the wavelet domain .",
    "secondly , it enables cross - correlation reduction using larger window frames containing several signals , as demonstrated in the following field example .",
    "the examples shown in figures [ fig : dm_csp]a and [ fig : dm_crp1]a are taken from a 3d real marine dataset , in common shot and channel gather , respectively .",
    "the main objective is to uncover primaries masked by strong multiple events using a multiple model .",
    "the 3d - srme model @xcite shown in figures [ fig : dm_csp]b and [ fig : dm_crp1]b achieves good precision on the near and mid offset range .",

    "figures [ fig : dm_fw_fa_csp ] and [ fig : dm_fw_crp1 ] represent subtraction results in common shot and channel gathers , respectively .",
    "additional details are provided in figures [ fig : z3 ] ( for improved visual amplitude assessment ) and [ fig : waveforms ] ( for accurate waveform comparison ) , to better illustrate the main features in data and differences between algorithms .    with a standard two - step method",
    ", the global step mainly contains waveform and time - shift corrections , combined with a global amplitude adaptation factor . in 2d , it is obtained with large 2d windows and long 2d filters .",
    "the global step is followed by a local adaptation , to account for local amplitude and phase discrepancies ( in 2d , with small 2d windows and short 1d filters ) .",
    "reference 2d algorithm parameters are taken from the best result obtained in an independent benchmark . despite not being used in practice , the 1d adaptive filter is provided for completeness only .    with the proposed one - step method , a morlet wavelet frame ( with parameters @xmath59 rad / s , @xmath60 $ ] , @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 )",
    "is used to decompose the data and reconstruct the filtered signal . in the wavelet transformed domain , the optimum unary filter estimation for each sample uses a rectangular window of @xmath63 s. additionally , to provide robustness against delays higher than half the signal period ( at each scale ) , we have chosen the maximum normalized cross - correlation criterion within a range of @xmath64 ms .",
    "this subtraction operator may compensate for additional distortions as well , e.g. , wavelet squaring introduced in convolution - based multiple models , since the estimation of the inverse wavelet is implicit in the estimation of an lse filter .",
    "being single - pass , wavelet - based unary wiener filters achieve slightly better non - coherent noise level ( e.g. , in figure [ fig : z3 ] ) . as pointed out in ellipses in figure [ fig : dm_fw_crp1 ] , standard 1d lacks in terms of primary preservation and multiple attenuation .",
    "while the standard 2d approach exhibits best performance to this respect , as shown in the zoom of figure [ fig : dm_fw_crp1 ] , the proposed method exhibits close performance , despite not using additional information conveyed by neighboring traces .",
    "figure [ fig : waveforms ] compares the waveforms of data , model , adapted and filtered results , for traces between indices 1470 and 1520 from figure [ fig : z3 ] .",
    "we appreciate how the set of unary filters successfully reduces the differences between multiple model and actual multiple events , to attain sufficient multiple event attenuation to uncover main primary events .",
    "the trace overlay indicate the waveforms are well preserved .    to complete the picture",
    ", we provide additional results on near offset stacks .",
    "figures [ fig : stk1 ] to [ fig : stk3 ] compare raw data and the different adaptive multiple subtraction methods .",
    "note that stacking removes a large portion of the multiples .",
    "the performance is thus evaluated on finer details , especially in the difference between raw data and filtered sections , as shown in figure [ fig : stk3 ] .",
    "the proposed 1d wavelet - based complex unary filter appears less aggressive with respect to the primaries previously masked by the multiples than the global adaptation step of a standard 1d method ( after the local step , over - adaptation was even higher ) , compare the pointed signals in figures [ fig : stk3]a and [ fig : stk3]b .",
    "however , as previously inferred , the proposed method leaves a little more remnant multiples than the standard 2d method , as it can be appreciated by comparing figures around shot number 1200 and above .",
    "the continuous wavelet frame provides an inherent scale - adaptive windowing that , when combined with the 1d complex unary filter , offers obvious improvements over standard 1d lse time - varying frequency filters , and compares promisingly , at least away from isolated event crossings , with the industry standard 2d method on the common - channel gather , where a perfect removal of the source effects can still be demanding .",
    "additional constraints may be added in the scale and in the space dimensions to improve the fractional delay estimation and reinforce the lateral coherence of the method , either with adaptive @xcite or low - redundancy multiscale transforms @xcite , which are robust to correlated noises and possess finer bandwidth selectivity than dyadic scales .",
    "we propose a model - based multiple subtraction which combines complex morlet wavelet frame with complex unary wiener filters .",
    "this subtraction method counter - balances the redundancy provided by this complex wavelet frame with the freedom of designing fast filters which allow for simple non - stationary model adaptation . complex unary filters with a low varying phase along scale",
    "can adapt fractional delays up to half the signal period at a given frequency . to add robustness against higher delays ,",
    "we integrate an integer delay term in the kernel of the unary filters , which can be estimated globally or locally , depending on the application . despite not competing with more advanced multiple removal methods , either regularized or in higher dimension spaces , the results of 1d unary filters in time - scale compare promisingly with standard 2d lse methods .",
    "the structure of the algorithm allows for reduced memory footprint , higher code parallelization , and is potentially suitable to sparse acquisition .",
    "further developments foresee additional diversity borrowed from neighboring traces , to improve apparent velocity separation and residual noise attenuation .",
    "the presented multiple removal technique aims at updating the portfolio of hybrid demultiple algorithms .",
