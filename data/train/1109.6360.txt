    "however , quantifying the escape fraction of ionizing radiation ( ) has proven to be challenging .    generally , the interstellar medium ( ism ) is optically thick to lyman continuum .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , the average hydrogen column density in galaxies ranges from a factor @xmath2  to @xmath3 times higher than the column that produces unity optical depth in the lyman continuum .",

    "for example , models have shown that a clumpy ism yields a higher  than a smoothly varying medium ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . for ionizing radiation to escape , low density paths out of the galaxy must be created . in starburst galaxies ,",

    "simulations show that the very shells and bubbles that generate low - density holes in the ism can initially trap ionizing photons before break - out , which will affect   @xcite .",
    "understanding this problem is complicated by the small number of galaxies detected with significant , despite large effort by the community to measure it both locally and at high redshift .",
    "direct detection of excess lyman continuum has been found in a subset of @xmath4 lyman - break galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "however , the fraction of galaxies with high  is low , on the order of 10% ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "one possible explanation for the low detection rate is an orientation bias . in the paradigm outlined above",

    "furthermore , figure  [ f : threecolor ] shows that the primary star - forming region extends only to @xmath24 pc , whereas photoionized material associated with the cone clearly extends beyond .",

    ", the extinction throughout the starburst is variable @xcite , and might enhance the observed  ratio relative to the intrinsic one . in particular , a dust lane with associated co along the minor axis is coincident with the location of the cone @xcite .",
    "however , figure 3 shows that we need @xmath25 mag to explain the observed  ratios entirely by the dust lane , which is much more than its observed extinction ( @xmath26  mag , * ? ? ?",
    "if there were that much extinction , we would expect a much lower flux along the cone , which is not seen in the emission - line images in figure [ f : threecolor ] .",
    "additionally , the [ s  ii]/  ratio observed in the cone can not be explained by extinction .",
    "we also note that the highest extinction will likely be strongest at the smallest @xmath22 .",
    "another possible effect is a bias in our observed  ratio caused by strong variations in electron density .",
    "this affects the [ s  ii]@xmath27 ratio , so that our observed @xmath28 may underestimate the total [ s  ii ] at high density .",
    "this error again will be largest at smaller radii where densities are larger , and leads to difference of @xmath29 between a density of @xmath30 and @xmath31 . in our long - slit spectrum ,",
    "[ s  ii ] @xmath32 ratio ranges from 1.4 to 1.0 , which correspond to densities of @xmath33 and @xmath34 , respectively .",
    "since this is a smaller variation than between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , the error on our observed [ s  ii ] due to density variations is likely much less than 25% .",
    "the measured emission - line fluxes in the ionization cone ( table [ t : galparams ] ) can set limits on the ionizing source .",
    "the  flux corresponds to an  luminosity @xmath35 .",
    "this is @xmath36 the total @xmath37 in the galaxy ( * ? ? ?",
    "* corrected for distance ) , from which we obtain a lower limit of @xmath38 on the rate of ionizing photons , @xmath39 , needed to explain the observed emission . an o7 star with the @xmath40 metallicity of ngc  5253 @xcite has @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "this implies that radiation equivalent to that produced by @xmath42  o7 stars is needed to ionize the gas .",
    "this is a lower limit for the radiation escaping the nuclear starburst , since the flux will be affected by internal extinction and .",
    "ngc  5253 is host to many young clusters that could be the source for the ionizing radiation illuminating the cone .",
    "two likely candidates are ngc  5253 - 5 @xcite and the ionizing cluster of the radio supernebula @xcite .",
    "the location of these objects , separated by just a few arcseconds on the sky @xcite , is noted by the cross in figure [ f : ion_param ] .",
    "both clusters are very young and very massive @xcite .",
    "in fact , the radio supernebula may be gravitationally confined @xcite .",
    "the 20 pc region around the radio supernebula hosts an ionizing population @xmath43  7000 o7 stars , with some uncertainty due to the high extinction towards this cluster @xcite .",
    "thus , the clusters in ngc  5253 easily generate enough ionizing flux to explain the ionization cone .",
    "the hi kinematics in ngc  5253 show only small scale rotation about the minor axis @xcite , making it unlikely that ngc  5253 is rotationally supported @xcite . in figure",

    "[ f : kinematics],width=321 ]    an expanding wind might explain the kinematics . in this scenario ,",
    "we expect the velocity to increase with distance from the galaxy , since the wind is expanding into the lower density gas of the halo . to the southeast",
    ", we do see an increase in velocity with galactocentric distance",
    ". however , it reaches a maximum at @xmath43  40  from the galaxy center before decreasing towards systemic at larger @xmath22 .",
    "this does not strictly follow what is expected for a free - flowing wind , in which the velocity should continue to increase .",
    "additionally , an expanding wind typically exhibits line splitting , which is not seen in the  profiles @xcite .",
    "kinematic data from hi observations are suggestive of either inflow or outflow along the minor axis @xcite . therefore ,",
    "although not completely straightforward , mechanical feedback might plausibly explain the observed kinematics based on the limited information available .",
    "typically , ionization cones are associated with agn , which suggests an alternative explanation for the ionization cone in ngc  5253 .",
    "the morphology of the cone is very narrow .",
    "this suggests collimation of the ionizing radiation , as would be expected if there is an agn present .",
    "the radio supernebula is particularly intriguing in this context .",
    "only @xmath46 in size , it provides roughly @xmath47 of the galaxy s ir flux at 12  @xcite .",
    "there is some debate about whether a young super star cluster or agn is the ionizing source of this nebula .",
    "its radio continuum has a flat slope , consistent with thermal emission @xcite , but which does not rule out an agn component @xcite .",
    "however , the observed spectral lines are also narrower than would be expected from an agn @xcite .",
    "additionally , x - ray observations of ngc 5253 show that the point sources and diffuse emission are consistent with star formation and shocks @xcite .",
    "therefore , while we can not rule out an agn in ngc  5253 , there are challenges facing that interpretation .",
    "if ngc  5253 has an obscured agn , a precessing jet might explain the gas kinematics .",
    "in this case , the velocities on one side of the galaxy should be mirrored exactly on the opposite side . in ngc  5253 , the overall sinusoid in velocity to the southeast",
    "is roughly reflected to the northwest .",
    "along the ionization cone , the velocity transitions from redshift to blueshift around @xmath43  30  from the galaxy . to the northwest , the opposite transition , of roughly equal amplitude ,",
    "is seen at @xmath43  28 .",
    "however , the reflection is not perfect ; there are points to the northwest where the velocity briefly flips , which are not seen to the southeast .",
    "additionally , the amount of blueshift to the northwest does not match the redshift observed in the southeast .",
    "therefore , while the general kinematics could be explained by a precessing jet , the discrepancies are difficult to reconcile in detail .",
    "based on our detection of an ionization cone in ngc  5253 , we suggest that an orientation bias can explain the difficulty in detecting escaping ionizing radiation in starburst galaxies .",
    "we observe evidence that ionizing radiation from ngc 5253 is traveling to large radii , if not escaping the galaxy entirely . assuming the cone is axisymmetric , the estimated solid angle subtended by the cone is @xmath48 of @xmath1  steradians , suggesting that the escape process happens over a small solid angle .",
    "if we assume isotropic radiation from 7000 o7 stars , as above , we could expect to see ionized - gas emission in this solid angle equivalent to that produced by 210 o7 stars .",
    "this is similar to our estimated @xmath49 o7 stars needed to generate the observed  emission in the cone , supporting the physical link between the source and the cone .",
    "the narrow morphology suggests that in order to detect lyman continuum , the line - of - sight to the galaxy must be close to the axis of escape .",
    "thus , the orientation of the galaxy should strongly influence the detectability of lyman continuum radiation .",
    "we can find further evidence for this scenario in recent observations by @xcite . in their study of 11 lyman - break analog galaxies and 15 local starbursts , including ngc  5253",
    ", they found indirect evidence for significant  in three of the lyman - break analogs .",
    "outflow velocities on the order of @xmath50 were found in all the galaxies suggested to have significant .",
    "these outflow velocities are so high , that we can interpret it to mean the direction of the outflow must be closely aligned to the lines - of - sight towards the galaxies . since winds in starburst galaxies",
    "are generally coincident with the poles @xcite , this suggests that these inferred high  are all associated with face - on systems .",
    "this fits our explanation that measurements of large  are biased towards galaxies whose outflow happens along our line - of - sight .",
    "the ionization cone in ngc  5253 provides a new perspective to our understanding of the fate of ionizing photons in starburst galaxies .",
    "this ionization cone appears optically thin , which is suggestive of the escape of ionizing radiation along the cone . at minimum",
    ", ionizing radiation is escaping from the nuclear starburst into the galaxy s halo .",
    "we considered both stellar and non - stellar sources for the ionization cone . assuming a stellar source , the massive clusters in ngc  5253 produce enough ionizing radiation to explain the   emission observed .",
    "however , the possibility of an obscured agn has not been ruled out .",
    "the  kinematics along the cone exhibit a complex morphology , but are consistent with some form of outflow .",
    "the data are not straightforward to interpret , but might be explained by an expanding wind or perhaps a precessing jet .    using the ionization cone of ngc  5253 as an analog for other starburst galaxies",
    ", we see that ionizing radiation escapes along the minor axis . additionally , the solid angle over which this radiation escapes is small , based on the cone morphology .",
    "this will constrain the viewing angles from which lyman continuum radiation can be detected .",
    "thus , the orientation of the galaxy will strongly influence the ability to detect lyman continuum radiation .",
