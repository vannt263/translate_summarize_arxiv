    "some time ago it was observed that the pure parabosonic @xcite ( and parafermionic @xcite ) systems possess the supersymmetry characterized by the nonlinear superalgebra .",
    "such nonlinear supersymmetry takes place in the simple quantum mechanical system generalizing the usual superoscillator @xcite , and earlier it was revealed in a similar but particular form in the fermion - monopole system  @xcite , and in the @xmath1-invariant systems of planar fermions @xcite and chern - simons fields @xcite .",

    "this will allow us to reveal the unexpected very close relation of the nonlinear supersymmetry with associated quantum anomaly problem to the quasy - exactly solvable systems @xcite being related , in turn , to the conformal field theory @xcite .",

    "one of them turns out to be closely related to the quasy - exactly solvable systems and this aspect of the nonlinear supersymmetry is investigated in section 4 .",
    "section 5 discusses the general quantum case of the @xmath4 supersymmetry in the context of anomaly - free quantization of the class of @xmath4 calogero - like supersymmetric systems found and analyzed in section 2 .",
    "we show also how this @xmath4 supersymmetry can be used for constructing new exactly solvable systems . in section 6",

    "we have shown that    * the anomaly - free quantization of the classical @xmath60-supersymmetric system with the holomorphic supercharges is possible for the superpotential of the quadratic ( [ w2 ] ) and exponential forms ( [ wexp ] ) only ; * the @xmath60-supersymmetric systems with the exponential superpotential are closely related to the well - known families of the quasi - exactly solvable systems @xcite ; * the @xmath4 supersymmetric calogero - like systems can be quantized in the anomaly - free way .",
    "the problem of the quantum anomaly is  cured \" here by the specific superpotential - dependent term of order @xmath0 .",
    "such a quantum term appeared earlier in the operator transformations method of constructing new solvable potentials from the known ones @xcite ; * the general @xmath4 supersymmetry associated with the calogero - like systems can be used for producing new exactly solvable potentials .",
    "the supersymmetric systems ( [ hg0 ] ) given by the superpotentials of the third type are canonically equivalent to the system ( [ decouple ] ) with the completely decoupled fermion degrees of freedom . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath154 quantum analogues of ( [ hg0 ] ) with superpotential of the third type are the systems with spontaneously broken linear supersymmetry . in this case",
    "the nilpotent operators @xmath403 are well defined and their anticommutator is equal to @xmath404 , i.e. @xmath405 look like @xmath121 quantum supercharges .",
    "however , these operators are not decoupled from the even operators @xmath125 and @xmath134 .",
    "therefore , the question is whether the quantum analogue of the above mentioned canonical transformations exists .",
    "if so , the quantum fermion degrees of freedom could be completely decoupled and the initial @xmath154 supersymmetric system would be reduced to the @xmath121 supersymmetric system in correspondence with the classical picture . on the other hand ,",
    "if such a transformation does not exist ( at least for some superpotentials @xmath19 ) , we face a sort of quantum transmutation .",
    "the classical equivalence of the calogero - like @xmath4 supersymmetric systems to the @xmath121 ( for @xmath178 ) and to the @xmath154 ( for @xmath169 ) supersymmetric systems of the canonical form ( [ hg0 ] ) is also based on the existence of the corresponding canonical transformations .",
    "if for the quantum calogero - like @xmath4 supersymmetric systems ( [ hd])([wd ] ) the quantum analogues of the above mentioned canonical transformations do not exist , we again have a quantum transmutation .",
    "the supersymmetric system ( [ hg0 ] ) represents the whole class of the symplectomorphic systems ( [ h1 ] ) .",
    "however , the quantization apparently breaks the equivalence of the systems ( [ h1 ] ) with different functions @xmath57 .",
    "therefore the quantization of the systems ( [ h1 ] ) may lead to different nontrivial quantum systems with @xmath60-supersymmetry .",
    "most likely , the anomaly - free quantization could be possible only for some special cases of the function @xmath57 and the superpotential @xmath19 . in this context",
    "it is necessary to stress that the quantum anomaly is specific not only for the nonlinear supersymmetry .",
    "the quantization of the general system ( [ h1 ] ) with @xmath154 and @xmath406 gives rise to the quantum anomaly .",
    "from this view - point one can say that the system of the form ( [ hg0 ] ) underlies the quantum linear supersymmetry since the quantization of such a system with arbitrary superpotential does not reveal any anomaly . however , it would be interesting to find at least one example of the quantum - mechanical system of the non - standard form ( [ h1 ] ) with the linear supersymmetry .",
    "since for the nontrivial cases the quantum analogue of the transformation ( [ ct ] ) is non - local , the corresponding system has to operate with non - local objects .",
    "it is possible that the supersymmetry of the pure parabosonic systems @xcite can be arrived at in this way .",
    "we hope that further investigations will shed light on the relation between the classical and quantum supersymmetries in the context on the described hypothetical quantum transmutations and the quantum anomaly problem .",
    "though we have considered the concept of the nonlinear supersymmetry for one - dimensional systems , it can be extended to the higher dimensional systems as well .",
    "for example , the two - dimensional system describing the motion of a charged particle in external magnetic field admits the nonlinear supersymmetries .",
    "the pauli hamiltonian of such a system is given by ( @xmath407 ) @xmath408 , where @xmath409 , and @xmath410 , @xmath411 , form the 2d vector gauge potential .",
    "for the gyromagnetic ratio @xmath412 this system reveals the usual linear supersymmetry both at the classical and quantum levels @xcite .",
    "it turns out that for @xmath413 the system possesses the @xmath60-supersymmetry . to show this",
    "let us introduce the complex variables @xmath414 . in terms of these variables",
    "the hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath415 . but",
    "this is exactly the form of the hamiltonian ( [ hg0 ] ) with the variables @xmath73 , @xmath416 changed for @xmath417 , @xmath418 .",
    "therefore , the hamiltonian commutes with the supercharges @xmath419 and , as a consequence , the system possesses the classical @xmath60-supersymmetry .",
    "the quantization of this system reveals the properties similar to those for the @xmath60-supersymmetric system with the holomorphic supercharges : the requirement of conservation of the nonlinear supersymmetry leads to the restrictions on the form of the magnetic field @xmath420 .",
    "one can show that as in the one - dimensional case , the form of the magnetic field turns out to be restricted by the quadratic case and by the sum of exponential functions in the variables @xmath421 @xcite .",
    "we suppose that such systems are also closely related to the two - dimensional quasi - exactly solvable problems .    to conclude",
    ", we note that our investigation of the nonlinear supersymmetry was motivated by the existence of nonlinear supersymmetry in pure parabosonic systems @xcite , where the reflection ( parity ) operator @xmath422 plays the role of the @xmath423-grading operator .",
    "such a special role of the reflection operator was the main idea in the construction of the minimally bosonized @xmath154 supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , where the role of the superpotential is played by the arbitrary odd function .",
    "therefore , the construction of the bosonized nonlinear supersymmetry is an attractive problem which we hope to consider elsewhere @xcite .    when this paper was finished , the interesting papers @xcite devoted to the development of the @xmath424 nonlinear supersymmetry of ref . @xcite",
    "have appeared .",
    "we note that the generalization of the @xmath60-supersymmetry with the holomorphic supercharges found in ref .",
    "@xcite and possessing the typical calogero - like structure of the @xmath4 supersymmetry from section 5 could also be treated in the context of the quasi - exactly solvable systems discussed here .",
    "0.5 cm * acknowledgements *    the work was supported by the grants 1980619 , 1010073 and 3000006 from fondecyt ( chile ) and by dycit ( usach ) .",
    "here we show that the arbitrariness in the definition of the superpotential , @xmath425 can not be used to change the type of the classical supersymmetry of the given system , i.e. we demonstrate the invariance of the classification obtained in section [ c2 ] . for the purpose ,",
    "it is enough to prove that the redefinition of the superpotential can not provoke a transition between the adjacent classes of supersymmetry .",
    "let us start by analysing the possibility of the transition from the supersymmetry of the first type with the superpotential unbounded from below to the supersymmetry of the second type .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we assume that the potential @xmath9 has finite number of minima , the lowest one is at the origin and is equal to zero .",
    "for such a potential , the superpotentials of the first and second types obey the relation @xmath426 .",
    "suppose that the bounded and unbounded superpotentials @xmath427 and @xmath428 with the associated supersymmetries of the first and second types correspond to the potential .",
    "the superpotential @xmath428 is a continuously differentiable function at @xmath429 only when the potential has the local behaviour @xmath430 . indeed , if @xmath431 , the bounded superpotential locally is @xmath432 , and as a consequence , its derivative is not regular at the origin .",
    "the case of the potential admitting the regular superpotential @xmath428 is presented on the fig .",
    "[ pic ] .    in this case",
    "the bounded and unbounded superpotentials @xmath428 and @xmath427 coincide for positive values of @xmath125 and have different sign for negative @xmath125 : @xmath433 if we have the nonlinear supersymmetry of the first type , i.e. @xmath434 , @xmath435 , then rewriting this function in terms of @xmath436 we obtain @xmath437 .",
    "the function @xmath10 is not good in terms of @xmath436 in the sense that there exist no canonical transformation that could reduce this system to that with the supersymmetry of the second type given by eq .",
    "( [ h3 ] ) . the potential with several minima can be considered in a similar way .",
    "the case of supersymmetry of the first type with a bounded superpotential merits the special analysis . after the transition ( [ trans ] ) to the superpotential @xmath186 of the second type",
    ", the function @xmath10 can be rewritten as @xmath438 , @xmath439 . the function @xmath440 has singularities at the points where the initial superpotential vanishes .",
    "therefore , the type of the supersymmetry can not be changed either .",
    "now let us consider the possibility of transition from the supersymmetry of the second type to that of the third type by means of the change ( [ trans ] ) .",
    "we suppose that the superpotential @xmath19 of a given system has a minimum equal to zero at the origin of coordinates .",
    "the superpotential of the third type defined by @xmath441 has the minimum equal to @xmath442 at the origin . rewriting @xmath10 in terms of the new superpotential",
    ", we obtain @xmath443 .",
    "there exists no canonical transformation ( [ ct ] ) that could remove the corresponding nilpotent part of the hamiltonian since the function @xmath444 is singular at the origin .",
    "the case of the superpotential with several minima can be treated in a similar way .",
    "this completes our proof of the invariance of the obtained classification of the classical supersymmetries .",
