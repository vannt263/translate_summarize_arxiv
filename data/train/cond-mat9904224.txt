    "at a near fundamental level , liquid metals are complex binary fluids consisting of ions in a sea of conduction electrons , their physical properties linked to the three corresponding correlation functions : @xmath2 , and @xmath3@xcite .",
    "we present a simple and evidently accurate analytic scheme to calculate electron - ion structure factors ( @xmath4 ) by combining a hard - sphere approximation for the ionic structure with a simple linear response theory for the electrons .",
    "these structure factors are now in principle accessible experimentally through recent advances in both neutron and x - ray scattering techniques .",
    "another route to effective electron - ion interactions therefore opens , but now through the fluid state .",
    "we also address the evident success of the linear approximation by studying a related problem , the density , @xmath5 , of an initially uniform electron gas induced by an embedded pseudo - potential , @xmath6 . by comparing linear and second order response to full ( kohn - sham@xcite ) non - linear response",
    ", we show that even though @xmath7 is not necessarily a small perturbation , the consequent response series converges term by term . the non - linear terms are significantly reduced by an interference between atomic and electronic length scales for most metals , the main exception to this being hydrogen .",
    "the electron - ion - structure factor can be written as@xcite : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fourier transform of the one - particle density operator of component @xmath10 , @xmath11 is the ion - ion structure factor and @xmath12 is identified as the pseudo - electron density , or pseudo - atom ( of valence z ) . thus electron - ion correlations can be described by convolving the pseudo - atom with the ionic correlations .",
    "the ionic correlations are themselves well described by a percus - yevick hard - sphere structure factor@xcite , while the pseudo - atom is described by a standard linear response formulation : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the well known linear response function ; to approximate @xmath14 we use a local density approximation ( lda ) local field factor@xcite .",
    "the electron - ion interaction is modeled by a simple local one - parameter empty - core pseudopotential@xcite i.e. : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the core radius and the pseudo - potential goes through zero at @xmath17 .",
    "( we note that at this linear level , the effects of ionic averaging on the pseudo - atom are ignored@xcite ) . using the approximations",
    "above in  ( [ eq5 ] ) , we compare our approach in fig",
    ". 1 to the _ full ab - initio _ car - parrinello@xcite calculations of de wijs _ et al_@xcite .",
    "the correspondence is striking , especially when we note that the parameters @xmath18 and @xmath16 are _ a priori _ set by other physical properties ( no fitting is necessary ) .",
    "besides a semi - quantitative description of electron - ion structure factors , this linear response theory now provides an important qualitative insight into the form of the electron - ion structure factors@xcite .",
    "the pseudo - atom density , @xmath12 , is typically largest for smaller @xmath19 and thereafter rapidly declines for larger @xmath19 , while the near classical ion - ion structure factor , @xmath11 , follows an inverse behavior ; it is small for small @xmath19 .",
    "together with the product form  ( [ eq5 ] ) this implies that the shape of the electron - ion structure factor , @xmath4 , is determined primarily by the the position of the _ zero - crossing _ , @xmath20 , of @xmath12 with respect to the _ first maximum _ , @xmath21 , of @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath22 , then @xmath11 selects ( or filters ) the negative part of @xmath12 and @xmath4 takes a form similar to that of mg ( fig .",
    "1 ( a ) ) .",
    "conversely , if @xmath23 , then the ion - ion structure factor selects ( or filters ) the positive part of @xmath12 , and again , @xmath4 takes a form similar to that of bi ( fig",
    ". 1  ( [ figfullbi_mg ] ( c ) ) .",
    "since @xmath14 is positive definite , the zero - crossing in linear response occurs at @xmath24 .",
    "the large slope of @xmath12 near the zero - crossing then implies that non - linear corrections _ must _ have a small effect on the location of the zero - crossing , and this , together with the expected accuracy of linear response , implies that @xmath25 . for most metals",
    ", @xmath24 is just a little less than @xmath26 , and the latter s ratio to @xmath21 is well known : for low valence @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; for high valence @xmath29 : @xmath30@xcite .",
    "this accounts in a straightforward way for the two separate forms found by dewijs _",
    "et al_@xcite : for mg , @xmath31 @xmath32 , which belongs to the * low valence class * of electron - ion structure factors . for bi , @xmath23 @xmath33 and we may refer to this as the * high valence class * of electron - ion structure factors@xcite .",
    "generally ions of valence @xmath34 belong to the low valence class while ions with valence @xmath35 belong to the high valence class .",
    "ions with valence @xmath36 typically belong to the high valence class also , although they may be characterized by a crossover form@xcite .",
    "the analytical approach above can easily be extended by using the modern theory of classical liquids to obtain improved ion - ion structure factors@xcite , but to include second order contributions to the pseudo - atom @xmath12 necessitates not only second order electron response , but also contributions from ion - ion triplet structure .",
    "the latter can be carried out with concepts from the theory of classical liquids@xcite .",
    "the principal features of electron - ion structure factors can be measured by exploiting the differences between the x - ray scattering structure factor , @xmath37 , determined with a free - atom form factor , @xmath38 , and the structure factor , @xmath39 , determined by neutron scattering@xcite .",
    "as emphasized by chihara@xcite the x - ray structure factor for liquid metals will equal @xmath39 only when determined with an ionic form factor augmented by a pseudo - atom form factor ; i.e. @xmath40 , so that : @xmath41 this effect is clearly expected to be largest for metals with larger ratios of valence to core electrons .",
    "thus we predict a small effect for metals with smaller valence to core ratio such as na or k , a 2% difference at the 1st peak of the structure for li ( ratio@xmath42 ) or al ( ratio@xmath43 ) , but by far the largest effect for be ( ratio @xmath44 ) where the difference at the principal peak of the structure factor could be as high as 7% , well within experimental range . another interesting candidate would be metallic si ( ratio @xmath45 ) since covalent effects still make themselves felt in the liquid state suggesting that experiments could reveal effects beyond linear response .    to date the experimental electron - ion structure factors and related pseudo - atoms show considerably more structure than indicated by theoretical predictions@xcite .",
    "significant experimental challenges are faced in the accuracy resulting from subtraction of two sets of data obtained by quite different means , each with important ( but different ) systematic corrections ; however the present approach suggests that the current differences between x - ray and neutron scattering should be reexamined ( see also@xcite ) . using a pseudo - atom instead of",
    "the full free atom as a form factor can assist in comparing neutron and x - ray measurements and help unravel various systematic corrections applied .",
    "the advent of high precision x - ray and neutron sources currently coming on - line suggests that these proposed effects can be systematically explored .",
    "the evident ( and long - standing ) success of the linear response approximation for electron response@xcite , here demonstrated for electron - ion structure factors , calls for further investigation .",
    "the accuracy of linear response in a crystalline solid is commonly attributed to the fact that the structure dependent reciprocal lattice vectors are typically near the pseudo - potential zero - crossing , @xmath24 , with the associated inference that the net scattering is smaller than one would naively expect@xcite . for liquids or other disordered systems such arguments",
    "are less appropriate . to examine the strength of linear response in the absence of ionic structure , we consider a simpler problem , namely the response of the interacting electron gas to a single ion , where the electron - ion interaction is modeled by a simple local one - parameter empty - core pseudopotential@xcite .",
    "we will compare two routes to the induced density , @xmath46 .",
    "the first follows from solving the kohn - sham equations@xcite exactly ( for the given pseudopotential ) within the local density approximation ( lda ) , the second from the standard expansion of the response in powers of the perturbing ( pseudo)potential , i.e. ; @xmath47 here the response functions , @xmath48 , are properties of the _ homogeneous _ interacting electron gas . in fig .",
    "2 we compare the explicit second order response with an lda local field factor@xcite to the full non - linear lda response . clearly the non - linear response is well characterized by the 2nd order term , implying that the success of linear response is not due to cancellation between higher order terms of opposite sign but instead that each successive term is individually small compared to the previous term in the expansion ; _ the response series converges very rapidly , term by term_.    the non - linear response is largest for atomic parameter @xmath49 ( hydrogen ) , and decreases with a larger atomic - parameter , @xmath16 , as might be physically anticipated .",
    "however as @xmath16 increases from zero , a noticeable secondary minimum occurs when the inverse atomic length , @xmath24 , is equal to @xmath26 . for the cases plotted in fig .",
    "2 , the maximum in second order response at @xmath50 ( or @xmath51 ) is reduced by an entire _ order of magnitude _ when compared with the maximum in second order response calculated for hydrogen ( @xmath52 ) , and is typically equal to the value at @xmath53 . the physics behind this minimum is attributed to the following ; the second order response function , @xmath54 , peaks when the summed arguments in  ( [ eq1 ] ) are close to @xmath26@xcite . if the pseudo - potential zero - crossing , @xmath24 , is near the response peaks at @xmath26 , a maximal cancellation or _",
    "maximal destructive interference of the atomic and electronic length scales _ occurs , leading to a minimum in second order response .",
    "the ratio of the atomic and electronic length scales is set primarily by the volume energy terms in the total ground state energy , and is almost independent of structure@xcite ; @xmath55 lies between @xmath56 and @xmath57 for most metals , and is therefore very close to the secondary minimum in the non - linear response .    as noted , the effect we discuss originates from an _ interference _ between intrinsic _ atomic _ and _ electronic _ length scales , but it also complements the argument given for crystalline solids alone , which stems from the _ confluence _ of an _ atomic _ and a _ structural _ length scale .",
    "the clear exception to these interference effects is again the singular case of a point - charge @xmath58 , i.e. the case of hydrogen , which has no well - defined core - length scale , @xmath24 , no oscillations in the potential and thus no interference effect in the higher order terms .",
    "in contrast to other systems , non - linear response terms are large term by term .",
    "in fact , the response series may not even formally converge and care must be taken when applying concepts derived from linear - response theory to hydrogen ( it is not a simple material ) .",
    "finally we note that the second order response contribution is of the same order as the difference between first order response with or without local field corrections .",
    "in addition , the combined effects of exchange and correlation partially cancel between first and second order , implying that _ neglect of higher order response results in an over - estimation of the role of exchange and correlation _ , which , in turn , has important implications for the widespread application of linear response theory in the derivation of effective ion - ion potentials in ( simple ) metals .",
    "the electron - ion structure factors of liquid simple - metals are well described by a simple linear response theory augmented by linear response for the electrons .",
    "this approach suggests two main classes of electron - ion correlation functions , one for high and one for low valence metals .",
    "experimental advances in x - ray and neutron - scattering may be able to provide measurements of these electron - ion correlation functions , with liquid be being the most promising candidate .",
    "a route to information on fundamental electron - ion interactions therefore becomes available through the fluid state .",
    "finally , the well documented success of the linear response approximation for electrons stems in part from an interference effect between atomic and electronic length scales .",
