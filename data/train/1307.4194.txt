    "factorization theorem of drell - yan process used to be a challenging question for a long time in past several decades @xcite .",
    "being different from the cases in deep inelastic scattering process and annihilation process of @xmath0 , glauber gluons can cause particular difficulty in the proof of factorization theorem of drell - yan process.@xcite .",
    "it was proved that leading pinch singular surfaces(lpss ) caused by glauber gluons will cancel out in covariant gauge after one sums over all possible cuts according to unitarity @xcite .",
    "therefore , unitarity plays crucial role in the proof of factorization theorem of drell - yan process .",
    "the proofs appeared in @xcite work in diagram level and turn out to be complicated .",
    "the hadronic tensor of drell - yan process reads : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the electromagnetic currant .",
    "it is connected with the differential cross section of drell - yan process by the formula : @xmath3 where @xmath4 .",
    "momenta of initial hadrons become light - like in the high energy limit @xmath5 , where @xmath6 .",
    "hety are denoted as @xmath7 and @xmath8 in such limit where @xmath9 and @xmath10 represent momenta of initial hadrons .",
    "the degree of freedom which contribute to leading pinch singularities , are :    ( 1)collinear particles , that is , particles with momenta scale as @xmath11 and @xmath12 ;    ( 2)hard particles , that is , particles with momenta scale as @xmath13 ;    ( 3)soft particles , that is , particles with momenta scale as @xmath14 .    diagrams that contain leading pinch singularities have the same topology as in fig.[fig : pinch]@xcite",
    ".        there can be arbitrary number of soft gluons exchanged between collinear particles , which is denoted as @xmath15 .",
    "soft gluons do not connect to the hard vertex , which is denoted as @xmath16 .",
    "there can also be arbitrary number of scalar - polarized gluons connected to the hard vertex for each jet in covariant gauge , which is proved to be appropriate for drell - yan process.@xcite there can be only one physical collinear particle(that is quark or transverse polarized gluons ) connect to the hard vertex for each collinear jet .    to prove the factorization theorem one has to show that :    \\(1 ) soft gluons exchanged between collinear particles do not violate factorization ;",
    "( 2)scalar polarized gluons connected to the hard vertex do not violate factorization .",
    "scalar polarized collinear gluons are absorbed into parton distribution function(pdf ) according to ward identity in @xcite .",
    "for the coupling between a soft gluon with momentum @xmath17 and a particle collinear - to - plus with momentum @xmath18 and mass @xmath19 , people use the the eikonal line approximation ( see for example @xcite ) : @xmath20 to factorize the soft gluon from the collinear particle and finally prove the cancellation of soft gluons .",
    "there is a special kind of soft gluons can violate such approximation , which are often named as glauber gluons in literatures.(@xcite ) they are space like soft gluons with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "for example , one may consider the coupling between a particle collinear - to - plus and a soft gluon with momentum scale as @xmath23 where @xmath24 , the eikonal line approximation does not work in such coupling . for processes without initial hadrons moving in different direction , for example the annihilation of @xmath0 ,",
    "there are not leading pinch singularities caused by glauber gluons and one can deform the integral path to avoid such region .",
    "( @xcite ) . for processes with initial collinear hadrons moving in different directions , for example the drell - yan process , however ,",
    "leading pinch singularities caused by glauber gluons@xcite do exist and this can cause particular difficulty in the proof of factorization theorem for such processes .    to over come this difficulty , people@xcite sum over all possible final cuts in diagram level and show that there are no longer leading pinch singularities caused by glauber gluons after this summation .",
    "one can then deform the integral path so that the eikonal line approximation works .",
    "soft gluons factorize from collinear particles in this approximation and will cancel out .    in this paper",
    ", we notice that electromagnetic currants are color singlets and the summation over all possible final hadrons equals to summation over all possible final states in this process .",
    "consequently , unitarity can be implemented at operator level . with this insight ,",
    "we present an alternative proof of factorization theorem of drell - yan process at operator level . this proof does not depend on explicit processes as it works at operator level and can be easily extend to some other processes .",
    "it also highlights theoretical aspects and physical pictures of factorization theorem more clearly compared to conventional diagram level approach .",
    "we first show the cancellation of effects of interactions after the hard collision in ( [ hmunu ] ) .",
    "this is the direct result of of time evolution operator of @xmath25 .",
    "after such cancellation , the @xmath26-function of energy conversation at the point @xmath27(@xmath28 ) becomes @xmath29 , where @xmath30 represent the total momenta that flow in to the vertex @xmath27 , @xmath31 denote the point at which the hard photon is produced .",
    "if soft gluons(momenta @xmath17 ) couple to particles collinear - to - plus at the point @xmath27 , then we can drop the plus momenta of soft gluons in the collinear internal lines .",
    "that is @xmath32 in the term @xmath33 .",
    "thus singular points of @xmath34 produced by internal lines collinear - to - plus all locate in the lower half plane if we define @xmath17 as flow into the point @xmath27 .",
    "this is our main strategy to prove the cancellation of lpss caused by glauber gluons .",
    "we will show this explicitly in this paper .",
    "the conclusion is that while dealing with coupling between a soft gluon with momenta @xmath17 and particles collinear - to - plus , one can always deform the integral path of @xmath34 to the upper half plane so that the eikonal line approximation works , where @xmath17 is defined as flow into the collinear particles .",
    "we work in the covariant gauge in such proof .",
    "coupling between soft gluons and collinear particles can then be absorbed into wilson lines of scalar - polarized gluons .",
    "we also bring in effective hard vertex that describe the sub - processes .",
    "effects of scalar - polarized collinear gluons are then absorbed into wilson lines in the effective hard vertex according to gauge invariance .",
    "we then factorize and cancel effects of soft gluons at operator level in the hadronic tensor .",
    "factorization theorem is then proved based on these facts .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we prove the cancelation of effects of interactions after the collision in the hadronic tensor at operator level in sec.[cancellation ] . in sec.[deformation ] we prove that one can deform the integral path so that the eikonal line approximation works in the hadronic tensor ( [ hmunu ] ) . in sec.[eft ] , we bring in the wilson lines of scalar polarized gluons that absorb the effects of soft gluons .",
    "we also construct effective action that describe the electromagnetic scattering processes between different jets in this section . in sec.[factorize ] , we consider the hadronic tensor and finish the proof of factorization theorem of drell - yan process .",
    "some discussions are given in sec.[conclusion ] .",
    "in this section we prove the cancellation of contributions of interactions after the collision in the hadronic tensor ( [ hmunu ] ) . to make the proof clear , we start from the transition amplitude for an explicit process , which gives : @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 denote hadrons , @xmath38 denote possible leptons or photons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are asymptotic states at times @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "we are working in schr@xmath43dinger picture in the right hand side of the equation .",
    "there are not interactions between these particles at times @xmath44 according to adiabatic approximation .",
    "we have : @xmath45 and @xmath46 as the consequence of confinement , such asymptotic states are separated hadrons(not quarks or gluons ) , leptons or photons .",
    "( the weak interaction is not concerned in this paper ) we expand the asymptotic hadrons according to their parton contents : @xmath47 and @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 represent parton states at @xmath41 and @xmath42 respectively .",
    "the transition amplitude can then be written as : @xmath51    for drell - yan process , we have : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 denotes interaction hamiltonian of qcd and qed respectively .",
    "we keep the tree level result of qed and full result of qcd at this step and have : @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the quark and lepton currants respectively , @xmath57 is the propagator of photons . according to this transition amplitude ,",
    "one can write the hadronic tensor ( [ hmunu ] ) as : @xmath58    @xmath59 is hermitian and we have : @xmath60 we have made use of unitaruty of the operator @xmath61 in the third line , the last line works in the interaction picture . that is : @xmath62 @xmath63 with @xmath64 an arbitrary time .",
    "the parton sates @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 equal to corresponding states in schr@xmath43dinger picture at the time @xmath68 .",
    "@xmath69 . the time evolution operator @xmath70 fulfills the identities : @xmath71 @xmath72    we see that there are not contributions of interactions after the collision in the second and third line of ( [ hadronic tensor ] ) .",
    "we now prove that we can deform the integral path so that the eikonal line approximation works in ( [ hmunu ] ) .",
    "our conclusion is that while dealing with the coupling between soft gluons(momenta @xmath17 ) and particles collinear - to - plus , one can always deform the integral path of @xmath34 to the upper half plane so that the eikonal line approximation works , where @xmath17 is defined as flow into the collinear particles .",
    "we work in covariant gauge in this section .",
    "we start from the evolution : @xmath73 with @xmath74 .",
    "the evolution of the currant is factorized into product of evolution of fermion fields .",
    "we first look at the evolution of the field @xmath75 . according to standard perturbation calculations",

    "we repeat the calculation and get the result : @xmath81 where @xmath82 are function of fermion fields and gluon fields that are not contracted with other fields .",
    "for example , @xmath83 .",
    "@xmath84 equals to @xmath85 for fermions and @xmath86 for gluons , @xmath87 .",
    "we do not contract fields in @xmath82 at this step , thus there is no more than one internal line connect @xmath27 and @xmath88 direct for each pair of @xmath27 and @xmath88 .",
    "one should sum over all possible combination of @xmath82 and @xmath89 , this is suggested by the third summation .",
    "if there are two points @xmath27 and @xmath88(@xmath90 ) not connected by the chains @xmath91 then the integral function in above formula is invariant under the permutation @xmath92 .",
    "this is because that we sum over all possible combination of @xmath82 and @xmath89 , internal lines or fields that connect to @xmath27 can also connect to @xmath88 .",
    "thus the order of @xmath93 and @xmath94 do not affect result in such case .",
    "we also notice that the propagators @xmath95 if @xmath96 , thus we can drop the constraints that @xmath97 and have : @xmath98 where @xmath99 denote possible symmetrization factors caused by the permutation @xmath92 , which are not connected by the chains @xmath91 or @xmath100 .    for the evolution of @xmath101 we have similar results .",
    "to get the matrix - element of the evolution of the currants we only need to contract fields in @xmath82 terms with other fields in such terms or contract them with initial or final states .",
    "we write the above formula in momenta space : @xmath102 or @xmath103    we now consider the coupling between glauber gluons and other modes . in the coupling between glauber gluon(momenta @xmath104 ) and soft(including glauber ) particles(momenta @xmath105 ) , there are at least one glauber gluon emitted or absorbed during the time range of propagation of a soft particle if @xmath106 , this is suppressed as power of @xmath107 . if @xmath108 then there are at least one ( ultra-)soft particle emitted or absorbed during the time range of propagation of a glauber gluon , this is suppressed as power of @xmath109 .",
    "thus one can take the eikonal line approximation in the coupling between glauber gluons and collinear particles with corrections of order @xmath110 if the other end of glauber gluons are not collinear particles , where @xmath18 represent momenta of collinear particles .",
    "we only need to consider the case that both ends of the glauber gluons are collinear particle . in the coupling between soft ( including glauber ) gluons and particles collinear - to - plus , the soft gluons should be polarized in the minus direction at leading order .",
    "while working in covariant gauge , the propagator @xmath111 do not contain singular points locate in glauber region .",
    "we notice that @xmath112 for arbitrary @xmath113 if @xmath114 locate in glauber region .",
    "thus , to give leading order contribution the other end of the propagators of glauber gluons should be polarized in the plus direction . as the result",
    ", the other end should be collinear particles with large minus momenta .    if there are not collinear internal lines at a point @xmath27 , that is , all collinear fields in @xmath82 are contracted with initial or final states and all @xmath115 and @xmath116(@xmath117 ) are not collinear",
    ", then we can neglect the small momenta components of the initial and final particles in the wave function(@xmath118 or @xmath119 ) or the polarization vectors .",
    "we will assume that there are at least one collinear internal line at the vertex @xmath27 at which soft particles couple to collinear particles .",
    "we consider the case that soft gluons couple to particles collinear - to - plus at the point @xmath27 and have : @xmath120 we then make the approximation : @xmath121 where @xmath122 for collinear particles , @xmath123 for soft particles .",
    "we can make such approximation as there are collinear internal lines . for internal lines",
    "collinear - to - plus only the large components of @xmath124 is important .",
    "if there are soft gluons in the @xmath82 , the momenta of which we denote as @xmath114 , then singular point of @xmath125 that locate in the upper half plane can only be produced by the @xmath82 term in ( [ mspace2 ] ) after ( [ momenta coversation ] ) and ( [ colliniear approximation ] ) .",
    "in addition , ( [ mspace2 ] ) can rely on @xmath126 only through the @xmath82 term .",
    "we also see that singular points of @xmath127(@xmath128 ) in glauber region that locate in the upper half plane can only be produced by the other end of @xmath115 , while that of @xmath129(@xmath130 ) that locate in the lower half plane can only be produced by the other end of @xmath131 .",

    "we can then deform the integral path of @xmath125 and @xmath127 to upper half plane and that of @xmath129 to lower half plane with radius of order : @xmath138 .",
    "after this deformation , we can drop the components @xmath139 in collinear internal lines at the point @xmath27 with corrections suppressed as power of @xmath140 we also notice that such coupling is itself of order @xmath141 as @xmath142 , where @xmath143 the is gauge parameter .",
    "the corrections to the approximation are no greater than : @xmath144 where we have assumed that @xmath145 is not too large , this is the case in the feynman gauge and landau gauge .",
    "we notice that @xmath146 and @xmath115 are defined as flow in to the point @xmath27 , @xmath131 is defined as flow out of the point @xmath27 , such deformation is in accordance with our claim at the beginning of this section .",

    "that is , the eikonal line approximation does work after this deformation .",
    "our proof do not rely on the explicit form of @xmath148 and can be extended to such evolution of other operators that are local in time .",
    "one can easily see that , our proof can also be extend to the case that interactions before the collision are cancelled . in that case , one should define that @xmath149 for @xmath90 .",
