    "@xmath0when john l.  kelly was working for bell labs , he observed analogies between calculation of the optimal player s stake who enters into a gambling game and the effective transmission of information in a noisy communication channel . during the last half century",
    "the strategy which was proposed by kelly became very popular among gamblers and inspired many authors of articles and books .",
    "the original paper dated from 1956 is hardly available .",
    "therefore , with the at&t consent , it has been recently reproduced in latex .",
    "today , strategies based on kelly criterion are successfully adopted in financial markets , blackjack and even horse races .",
    "the central problem for gamblers is to find positive expectation bets .",
    "but the gambler also needs to know how to manage his money , i.e. how much to bet .",
    "application of the kelly criterion in blackjack was quite successful @xcite .",
    "if all blackjack bets paid even money , had positive expectation and were independent , the resulting kelly betting recipe when playing one hand at a time would be extremely simple : bet a fraction of your current capital equal to your expectation .",
    "does the kelly criterion unambiguously specify the winning strategy ?",
    "in the thermodynamic limit the maximization of the expectation value of logarithm of the profit rate still leaves freedom of adopting different strategies . because of calculational difficulties , only the limit case of extreme profit can be given in a concise analytical form .",
    "kelly s association suggests a method of describing effectiveness of agents investing in the financial market in thermodynamical terms .",
    "let us consider the simplest bookmakers bet .",
    "it can be described by disjoint alternative of two events ( the random events , the majority branches of events ) , which we denote @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "we assume that @xmath3 ( where @xmath4 , and @xmath5 ) is the fraction of current capital of @xmath6-th gambler , bet on event @xmath7 , and @xmath8 describes the sum of wagers from all the gamblers of the bet .",
    "accordingly , @xmath9 is the odds paid for the @xmath6-th gambler on the occurrence of the @xmath7-th event .",
    "the following conditions define our bet :    a ) : :    we shall consider the case of `` fair '' odds ( payoff odds are    calculated by sharing the pool among all placed bets  the parimutuel    betting ) , i.e.    @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "b ) : :    all fees and taxes are not taken into account which means that all the    money is paid out to the winners :    @xmath12 ( it should be noted that the gamblers are placing    their bets differently , it means that the winners take all the pool ) .",
    "the trade balance @xmath13 is the natural premise .",
    "let us observe that all costs and bookmaker s benefit might be the fee for participation in the game .",
    "the winner carries out an analysis of this cost after the winnings . the above condition a is equivalent to the statement that the bookmaker bet is a good offer on the effective market without an opportunity of arbitrage between the gamblers .",
    "the conditions a and b describe uniquely the value of the factors @xmath14 , which can be derived from formulas @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath13 .",
    "we have that : @xmath17    the formal description of the bookmaker bets with majority of branches of events might be created hierarchically as the binary tree with the leafs  elementary events , e.g by analogy to the construction of tree - shaped key to compressing / decompressing huffman code @xcite .",
    "it follows that our binary bet is _ universal _",
    ", i.e many kinds of financial decisions we can describe as the systems based on a hierarchy of formal binary bets . within the analogical model for insurance , the differences would only appear in the equation @xmath18 of balanced benefit . in this case",
    "the balance @xmath18 includes the possible loses which are relevant in insurances .",
    "we will omit the subscript @xmath6 because we analyze the gain of a particular gambler .",
    "we will use the following notation : @xmath19  the gambler s capital before placing bets , accordingly @xmath20  the gambler s capital after result of @xmath1 , analogically @xmath21  after result of @xmath2 .",
    "the balance of expense and gambler s income is given by the formula : @xmath22 from the projective geometry point of view , where the assets exchange are described without scale effect in a natural way , the profit ( up to a multiplicative constant ) is the unique additive invariant of the group of homographies , which include all objective irrelevant transformation between different ways of mathematical modelling of the financial effect . when the @xmath7-th event occurs the bookmaker bet , in this context ,",
    "is represented by the following configuration of the straight lines :    # 1#2#3#4#5 @font    ( 6987,5667)(0,-10 ) ( 749,1158)(6975,161 ) ( 1097,710)(649,5391 ) ( 998,710)(1795,5421 ) ( 649,959)(6577,2950 ) ( 500,3149)(6875,62 ) ( 450,5291)(4684,12 ) ( 500,5640)(2044,361 ) ( 50,2870)(0,0)[lb]portfolio ( -350,2700)(0,0)[lb]with coupons ( 1125,870)(0,0)[lb]@xmath23 ( 6260,100)(0,0)[lb]@xmath24 ( 6075,2880)(0,0)[lb]@xmath25 ( 750,4910)(0,0)[lb]@xmath26 ( 5550,200)(0,0)[lb]@xmath6 ( 600,3900)(0,0)[lb]@xmath27 ( 1500,4946)(0,0)[lb]@xmath28 ( 3920,350)(0,0)[lb]@xmath19 ( 1520,720)(0,0)[lb]@xmath29    the straight lines @xmath25 and @xmath28 and @xmath25 represent the hyperplane of codimension one . ] express the proportion of an exchange ( the market rate ) of the initial capital on the our financial obligations and analogically the final obligation , respectively . the lines @xmath6 and @xmath27 denote the portfolio with ready money ( before the closing a business and after the settlement of accounts of the bets ) and the portfolio which include the bookmaker coupons ( when the bet has been in effect ) .",
    "the set of the projection points @xmath30 is the unique invariant of the game which is defined by the gambler s strategy .",
    "the unique representation of the exchange of the bookmaker stakes @xmath25 and @xmath28 is possible only with the accuracy of the homograpic transformation .",
    "thus bookmaker stakes are the covariant components of the model .",
    "they depend on choice of the basis of goods units ( that means the basis of vector space which is related to parametric portfolios  the projection points of homogeneous coordinates ) .",
    "thus the set @xmath30 , often called as an absolute , allows one to equip the projective space with the hilbert metrics @xcite and non - arbitrary measure of the distance between two portfolios @xmath25 and @xmath28 given by this metrics .",
    "it represents the profit flow in the transaction cycle @xmath31 .",
    "this profit is equal to @xcite : @xmath32|=\\ln all_k - \\ln all_0\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath33 $ ] is a cross ratio of the projective points @xmath27 , @xmath25 , @xmath28 , and @xmath6 .",
    "let us denote the percentage share of gambler s capital in both cases of the bookie bets by @xmath34 and let @xmath35 be the probability of the @xmath7th event . if @xmath36 then the gambler s expected profit is equal to : @xmath37",
    "the gambler bets the stakes @xmath38 and @xmath39 such that her / his expected profit is the maximal one : @xmath40 by using the standard method we find the extremum of the differentiable function and we obtain that the family @xmath41 of the strategies solutions of above problem is described by the following straight line equation : @xmath42 and the maximal profit is given by : @xmath43 where @xmath44 is boltzmann / shannon entropy .",
    "thanks to this eq @xmath45 , we have the financial interpretation of kelly s formula . the maximal profit",
    "given by eq @xmath45 has two components .",
    "the first of these elements is the profit on unpopularity of the winning bet ( the seer s profit ) @xmath46 , and second means the ( minus ) entropy @xmath47 of the branching .",
    "the value of @xmath48 is nonnegative  a rational gambler can not loose .",
    "thus her / his average profit equals to @xmath23 if the resultant preferences adopt to the probability measurement to the branching : @xmath49 .",
    "consequently , one can make profit in the bookie bet only when somebody bets irrationally in the same game .",
    "till this moment we have assumed that there is no any additional condition for the simplest bookmaker bet , we allow the short position of the gamblers ( negative value of @xmath50 ) .",
    "this is the reason why the rational gambler has the freedom of choosing the value of financial outlays @xmath51 which is placed in bookmaker bets . in the absence of short positions ( a typical restriction on the bet @xmath52 ) we assume",
    "that the rational gambler diversificates the risk in such a way that she / he bets only the minimal part of their resources . from all the strategies @xmath53 we choose",
    "the optimal one : @xmath54 when @xmath55 , or , equivalently , the one that can be obtained by the transposition @xmath56 of the indices @xmath7 .",
    "if we do not have the information about proportion @xmath57 then we use laplace s principle of indifference ( @xmath58 ) , and in this case ( when @xmath59 ) the optimal stakes are ( @xmath60 , see  [ kelly ] .",
    "let us now consider the variant of the binary bet when the gambler s contribution of the @xmath61 to the sum @xmath62 is not neglected . if the gambler pays to the pool , the pool of the bets grows from @xmath63 to @xmath64 , where @xmath65 .",
    "consequently the parts of the pool corresponding to different events are going to change from @xmath66 to @xmath67.then the part of the gambler s expected profit @xmath68 which is linear in @xmath69 will be given by : @xmath70 @xmath71 ^ 2\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 it is sufficient to restrict oneself to the case when @xmath69 is an infinitely small number and then we can consider the corrected parameters @xmath73 and @xmath74 ( change of @xmath69 ) .",
    "the extremal strategy is defined by the set of equations : @xmath75 the solutions of these equations are the roots of two polynomials of degree five . , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 , and taking advantage of  the language symbolical calculation _",
    "mathematica_. few exemplary lines are added in appendix ] according to the fundamental theorem of galois theory , we can conclude that an analytic form of the conditions for the optimal big player s strategy is not countable .",
    "we can find the family of parameters @xmath78 by using numerical methods , but we never can investigate the behavior of characteristics of the rational big gamblers .    due to the universality of the binary bet model , we can conclude that any type of analysis of big investors strategies , whose appearance will disturb the financial market , will not be satisfactory because of principal mathematical reasons .",
    "it is also possible that macroeconomic thermodynamics considered as the analysis of the market disturbing strategies is forbidden by mathematics ! in these contexts",
    "the tendency of diversification in the investment might be perceived as an escape of the investors from the unsolvable problems .",
    "is it really true that _ small is beautiful _ also in the markets ?",
    "we are greatly indebted to prof .",
