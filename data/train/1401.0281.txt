    "the inside of biological cells is a crowded and complex environment composed of chemically different low- and high - molecular weight compounds dissolved in the aqueous solvent . in order to model this internal cellular milieu _ in vitro _ , biopolymers , such as polypeptides , proteins , and dna ,",
    "are usually studied in aqueous solutions of different composition and with different imposed constraints @xcite . in this complicated solution environment",
    "there are multiple ways that solute molecules can interact with one another and with the aqueous solvent .",
    "the hydrogen - bonding ( hb ) network between water molecules , accounting for much of the anomalies present in its still contentious phase diagram @xcite , stabilizes various distinct conformations of biopolymers providing short- and long - range interactions among the non - contiguous parts of the polymer chain . obviously , there is a strong competition between the polymer - polymer and the polymer - water hydrogen bonding , which must be properly taken into account in order to describe the biopolymer conformational space or its modifications as a consequence of the action of co - solutes and solvents . in general",
    "a solute molecule can have a double effect on biopolymer conformations @xcite : i ) it can _ directly _ bind to a biopolymer , therefore competing with intrinsic intra - polymer hydrogen bond configurations - we dub these _ competing interactions _ , but also ii ) it can _ indirectly _ affect biopolymer conformation through changes in the activity of water , that then acts osmotically in tuning biopolymer configurations - we dub these _ non - competing interactions_. for different systems it is often possible to choose between the two frames of reference depending on the nature of the macromolecular system , the experimental design , and the properties that are being observed .",
    "consistent with these different perspectives there are also a number of different theoretical approaches to biopolymer conformational changes , most notably the helix - coil transition , which will be the focus of our discussion here .",
    "historically they have been quite often formulated in the context of _ spin models _ and can thus creatively engage the whole repertoire of the theoretical methodology devised in that context @xcite .",
    "however , these different models are not equally conducive to a straightforward inclusion of solvent effects .",
    "for instance , the original zimm - bragg ( zb ) model makes it difficult to account for microscopic details of the polymer - solvent interaction , and thus even a qualitative agreement with experiment is sometimes rather difficult to achieve @xcite . in the zb theory",
    "there are in fact two major parameters , the _ stability _ , @xmath0 , and the _ cooperativity _ , @xmath1 , that can be affected by the solvent @xcite .",
    "while the cooperativity parameter is assumed to be independent of the temperature , the stability parameter is temperature dependent .",
    "in fact it can be expressed through the free energy difference between the helix and coil conformations , @xmath2 as @xmath3}=\\exp{[\\delta u / t - \\delta s]}$ ] ; where @xmath4 is temperature , @xmath5 is the energy and @xmath6 the entropy @xcite , so that the transition temperature is determined from the condition @xmath7 , implying a compensation between the energetic and entropic changes @xcite .",
    "this decoupling into the energy and entropy contributions is even more straightforward for other types of helix - coil transition models . in the lifson - roig ( lr )",
    "approach the entropic and energetic parameters are in fact explicitly decoupled @xcite .",
    "the transition temperature is here obtained from the condition @xmath8}=q$ ] , where again @xmath9 is the energy change at the transition and @xmath10 the entropic penalty for the formation of hydrogen bonds . in both approaches",
    "the solute molecule can affect biopolymer conformations through the dependence of the entropic and energetic parameters on the solvent properties . since the zb and lr models can be alternatively formulated through the microscopic hamiltonian of a more general type @xcite , dubbed the generalized model of polypeptide chain ( gmpc ) , that also depends on an entropic parameter @xmath10 and an energetic parameter @xmath11 ( @xmath12}$ ] ) , the consideration of solvent effects on the level of the gmpc model level could be of paramount importance and can have far reaching consequences .    a major issue for the spin models of the aqueous solvent is to take proper account of the explicit tetrahedral hb network geometry , as well as the correct orientation of water molecules in close proximity to different molecular moieties along the biopolymer chain .",
    "optimally the spin - like model of the solvent with hydrogen bonding ability should be rich enough to describe the specific intra - polymer h - bonding , as well as take into account the non - specific osmotic action of the solutes and thus exhaustively characterize the dual action of the solutes .",
    "as we show in what follows , the specific solvent - polymer h - bonding interaction inevitably redefines the temperature - dependent energetic parameter @xmath11 @xcite of the gmpc model , and on the other hand the non - specific type of interaction , as exemplified by polyethylene glycol ( peg ) @xcite , leads to the renormalization of the entropic parameter @xmath10 ( no direct analogue with zb model , since both @xmath0 and @xmath1 effectively include the entropy of coil @xmath10 ) , which becomes temperature - dependent .",
    "obviously the equilibrium between the different biopolymer conformations can be altered by changing either @xmath11 or @xmath10 , so that both solvent mechanisms are relevant .",
    "we will demonstrate that within the gmpc framework both mechanisms of solvent action can be dealt with on the same footing by tracing over the solvent degrees of freedom _ explicitly _ and _ exactly _ , so that the ensuing effective partition function combines all the solvent effects in a unified framework with renormalized values of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath10 . while this in itself is a major formal advance",
    "we also demonstrate how it can be used in the context of various problems involving conformational transitions of biopolymers in the aqueous solvent .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we first summarize the solvent - free gmpc model of the helix - coil transition and briefly describe the methods we apply .",
    "then , to account for both mechanisms of solvent action we complement the basic , _ in vacuo _",
    "hamiltonian @xcite with two additive terms .",
    "each of these terms has been treated separately before @xcite , but the detailed description of simultaneous effect of both has not been reported yet . in the appendix",
    "we show how the solvent - related parts of hamiltonian , that describe different mechanisms of action can be both traced over in the partition function to reduce the problem to the basic gmpc model with renormalized parameters .",
    "the proposed strategy allows us to generalize the problem of solvent description in such a way that both mechanisms of solvent - polymer interaction are described properly .",
    "the current paper is a logical extension of ref .",
    "@xcite and complements the line of research presented in refs .",
    "finally we show that many biopolymer properties and peculiarities in their behavior , such as the hot and cold denaturation , the temperature dependence of the hydrophobic effect and the unusual behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins can be explained within the unified framework proposed in this work .",
    "the helical structure of biopolymers is stabilized mainly by intermolecular hydrogen bonding between repeat units ; the presence of hydrogen bonds is a necessary prerequisite for the formation of the helix",
    ". statistical description of the helix - coil transition requires three parameters : the energy parameter @xmath13 , where @xmath5 is the energy of the hydrogen bond ; the entropy parameter @xmath10 , that stands for the ratio between the number of all accessible states versus the number of states available for the repeat unit in the helical conformation ; and a geometric parameter @xmath14 , that describes the geometry of hydrogen bond formation .",
    "hydrogen bond formation in polypeptides is known to affect three successive repeat units , thus @xmath15 in any solvent .",
    "this parameter controls the size of the transfer matrix , dictating the transfer matrix size of the lr model to be @xmath16 @xcite . instead",

    "this is in accordance with the general physical considerations : the transition takes place at the point where entropy and energy compensate each other .",
    "the distance of minimal approach of eigenvalues can be estimated as @xmath37 ( see @xcite ) and is related to the final transition interval .",
    "parameter @xmath14 in our model plays the role of the spatial scale of the many - body interactions . for nearest neighbor interactions @xmath38 , for next - nearest neighbor interactions @xmath15 .",
    "we consider @xmath15 for polypeptides and @xmath39 for dna , so @xmath40 to mimic the short - range character of hydrogen bonding .",
    "if , instead , long - range interactions are assumed to act in the system , @xmath41 and the distance of minimal approach of eigenvalues would tend to zero so that the lowest two eigenvalues would be degenerate . in the spin language this signals the presence of a phase transition in the system .",
    "however , since we keep @xmath14s finite , no phase transition _ sensu stricto _ can happen in our model . to quantify the above , it is useful and informative to introduce the spatial correlation length as @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the first and second leading eigenvalues of the characteristic equation .",

    "additionally , we can also easily calculate the degree of helicity as @xmath47 armed with this model and the methods of its solution we can proceed to generalize the original formulation by including the effects of the solvents .",
    "we assume the repeat units that are not bonded by intra - molecular h - bonds are free to form polymer - solvent intermolecular bonds and some solvents , such as water and urea , are able to form hydrogen bonds with nitrogen bases of dna or with peptide groups of protein amino - acids @xcite .",
    "when one intra - molecular h - bond is broken , two solvent molecule binding sites become vacant . thus , in the case of polypeptides , there are only two binding sites per repeat unit , while in the case of dna there are four ( @xmath48 for an a - t pair ) or six ( @xmath49 for an g - c pair ) binding sites , so @xmath50 @xmath51 spin variables are required to describe the interaction between solvent molecules and each repeat unit .",

    "only those repeat units of the polymer that do not participate in intermolecular hydrogen bonding are available for hydrogen bond formation with solvent",

    "the hamiltonian for such a model of competing solvent ( cs ) reads @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the reduced energy of a polymer - solvent h - bond . due to the presence of the term @xmath64 in eq.([hamcs ] ) , as opposed to the @xmath65 term in eq.([ham - basic ] ) , the solvent is competing with the polymer for h - bond formation , depending on the ratio @xmath66 .",
    "there are many solvents or co - solutes that do not affect the hydrogen bonding directly , but do modify the polypeptide conformations by changing the chemical potential or the osmotic pressure of the solvent .",
    "a classical example of such a co - solute is peg , which can act as an osmoticant and as a depletion agent @xcite .",
    "because of their size , peg molecules are depleted from the proximal regions of the polypeptide chain , exerting an osmotic pressure that changes the energetic cost of certain conformations at the expense of others .",
    "we have introduced a model that describes these effects in @xcite . however",
    ", other types of solvents may exist besides the osmolytes . to cover all possible cases of non - h - bonding solvent , we model the solvent using the following assumptions .    1",
    ".   solvent can interact with ( affect ) both helical and coil units of polymer .",
    "2 .   interaction with a solvent molecule changes the energy of repeat unit depending on its conformation ( @xmath67 if the repeat unit is helical and @xmath68 otherwise ) .",

    "the corresponding hamiltonian of non - competing solvent ( ncs ) reads    @xmath73    where @xmath74 .",
    "interactions between some solvents ( _ e.g. _ urea ) , and a polymer have certainly an additional component besides the simple h - bonding .",
    "it may therefore happen that the same solvent affects polymer conformations through both effects : direct h - bonding and non - h - bonding mechanisms .",
    "thus it seems to be a better idea to discuss the mechanisms of action and not specifically the solvent types .    in general",
    ", the solvent can interact with the biopolymer by both mechanisms .",

    "however , even these exotic scenarios could be modeled within the spin model hamiltonian , e.g. in the context of a bell - lavis spin model , that allows for a reentrant phase diagram involving low and high density phases of water as was recently pointed out @xcite .    however , because we are mostly interested in the influence of the solvent on the biopolymer conformations and not vice versa , it would seem that a detailed description of the bulk solvent is of a lesser relevance @xcite . excluding the extremophiles , biological systems thrive at temperatures between the freezing point and the boiling point of water .",
    "therefore , there is no real need to describe the critical properties of solvents in this context . on the other hand",
    ", water is actively rearranging its h - bonding network even at ( and below ) room temperature , so that it can not be described as some solid and unresponsive medium .",
    "additionally , the polymer - solvent interactions that we take into account are short ranged in space and thus allow to significantly simplify the description of solvent - induced effects on the polymer and to reduce the solvent description from a three - dimensional one to a one - dimensional one .    by considering two separate models of solvents we described two different _ mechanisms of solvent - biopolymer interaction _ , corresponding to explicit and implicit interactions , simultaneously and on the same footing .",
    "for instance , peg molecules of intermediate length are big enough to act implicitly as osmolytes creating osmotic stress , while at the same time the hydrogen bonding ability of low molecular ethylene glycol could still be affecting the interactions explicitly .",
    "for peg molecules of @xmath118 repeat units the hydrogen bonding activity could be disregarded , since fluctuations will destroy any direct h - bonds between large peg molecules and the polypeptides , but for shorter peg molecules both mechanisms can play a role . in general , it becomes an interesting and still open question what is the most important mechanism of action for solvents like urea and guanidine in solution with water and polypeptides .",
    "is cold denaturation in solutions with urea or guanidine arising due to increased preference of polymer - solvent hydrogen bonding ( increased @xmath89 ) , or is it due to osmotic stabilization ( increased @xmath108 ) , or in fact both ?",
    "the possibility of having both heat and cold denaturation is a property that results from the directionality of h - bonding interactions and this is a feature shared by both polypeptides and polynucleotides .",
    "often , however , cold denaturation temperature appears at temperatures below the water freezing point , making the experimental observation impossible .",
    "the situation for dna is even worse .",
    "in fact the smaller the entropy of the coil state , the lower is the reentrant transition temperature ( see fig . 3 of of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , so that the cold denaturation of dna would be very difficult to observe .",
    "these facts make our theoretical considerations of great importance , since adding a non - competing solvent to the solution may potentially make the observation of cold denaturation possible even for systems where such observations would be difficult otherwise .",
    "while skepticism has been voiced in the literature that an implicit description of the solvent is unlikely to account for for both cold and heat denaturation unless the model parameters are fitted to thermodynamic properties ( e.g. , temperature - dependent energetics ) @xcite , our implicit models of solvent do exactly what has been deemed as `` unlikely '' .",
    "also the conviction that only explicit solvent models can describe the heat and cold denaturation naturally from first principles @xcite does not seem to so self - evident as it would appear from the example of e.g. the popular mercedes - benz ( mb ) model of water @xcite .",
    "in fact our model of a solvent with h - bonding interactions is conceptually very close to the explicit water models with directional interactions , like the mb model .",
    "indeed , the most natural analytic way to describe the orientational interactions on the hamiltonian level is through the multivalued spin variables @xcite , like what we did for the gmpc model . it might thus be appropriate to rather adjust the strict statement on the explicit solvent models into a softer statement that the proper model of the solvent need to exhibit explicitly only the _ directional interaction _ of the solvent in order to recover both the heat and the cold denaturation naturally from first principles .",
    "another potentially fruitful research area where the proposed theory may be of great importance , is the `` unusual '' behavior of intrinsically disordered proteins .",
    "first , although disordered , they are functional and resistant to cold treatment @xcite , so we are still missing some crucial info about the basics of the folding event itself . many idp s also gain structure upon increasing temperature in the range from 3 to 50 degrees celsius or decreasing ph from 5.5 to 3.0 @xcite . also of note",
    "is that some idp s in crowded environment are folding , while others remain unfolded @xcite .",
    "these facts , coupled with our results , summarized in phase diagrams figs",
    ".  [ f7 ] and [ f8 ] , show that the disordered state of idp s belongs to the low - temperature region of the phase diagram , so that decreasing temperature does nt have any effect , while increasing it results in cold denaturation and/or refolding .",
    "this transition takes place at conditions where globular proteins usually loose structure , while idp s gain it .",
    "resistance to crowding is nicely visible in fig .",
    "[ f8 ] , where the low - temperature part of the curve describing cold denaturation is almost parallel to the @xmath119-axis that describes the crowding in the system ( @xmath108 ) . in the same figure",
    "it is also visible that the more pronounced is the competition between the inter- and the intra - molecular hydrogen bonding ( larger @xmath89 values ) , the higher is the temperature of cold denaturation , which explains why some idp s gain order in crowding conditions while others do not .",
    "the present study of solvent effects has important implications on both polypeptides and dna and the qualitative picture that we derived is very reach , including the possibility for both the reentrant as well as direct helix - coil transitions , enabling situations when only a certain amount of helicity is lost / gained .",
    "such effect might share light on changes of disordered protein conformations and dna replication and explain how these processes are regulated by solvents inside a cell .",
    "our theory also allows for explanations of the unusual behavior of the intrinsically disordered proteins , thus showing a strong potential for future studies in this vastly developing research field .",
    "while we have limited ourselves to the helix - coil transition phenomenon , the approach advocated is extendable to any spin - based theory of conformational transitions in polymers .",
