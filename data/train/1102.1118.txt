    "by the hyperbolic dehn surgery theorem ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 5.8.2 ) , all dehn surgeries on a hyperbolic knot give hyperbolic manifolds with only finitely many exceptions . thus a dehn surgery on a hyperbolic knot creating a non - hyperbolic manifold is now called an _ exceptional surgery _ , on which a large mount of studies have been done .",
    "see @xcite for a survey on this topic for example .    in this paper",
    ", we consider exceptional surgeries on pretzel knots @xmath3 in the 3-sphere @xmath4 of type @xmath5 with @xmath6 . here",
    "note that @xmath7 and @xmath8 must be odd otherwise @xmath3 has two or more components .",
    "also we assume that @xmath9 since @xmath10 and @xmath11 are non - hyperbolic , where @xmath12 denote a torus knot of type @xmath13 .",
    "all the other knots @xmath3 are known to be hyperbolic .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "exceptional surgeries on such pretzel knots have been studied extensively , motivated by the fact that the class of the knots includes various interesting examples about exceptional surgeries .",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for example .",
    "we here recall that exceptional surgeries are classified into the following three types : a reducible surgery ( yielding a reducible manifold ) , a toroidal surgery ( yielding a toroidal 3-manifold ) , a seifert fibered surgery ( yielding a seifert fibered 3-manifold ) , which is a consequence of an affirmative answer to the geometrization conjecture .    our first result concerns toroidal surgeries on the knots .",
    "it is known that only the @xmath14-surgery on the @xmath5-pretzel knot is toroidal , and the surgered manifold contains the unique embedded incompressible torus up to isotopy .",
    "see @xcite for detailed descriptions .",
    "[ thm : toroidal_kabaya ] consider the toroidal manifold obtained by the @xmath14-surgery on the hyperbolic @xmath5-pretzel knot with odd integers @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath16 be the one of the two components obtained from the toroidal manifold by cutting along the unique embedded incompressible torus , which is not a twisted @xmath2-bundle over the klein bottle .",
    "then @xmath16 is homeomorphic to the manifold obtained by a @xmath17-surgery on the chain - link with three components , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "the chain - link with three components is depicted in figure  [ fig : chain_link ] , whose complement is called the `` magic manifold '' . for its definition and notation ,",
    "see @xcite in detail .",
    "in particular , in @xcite , the exceptional surgeries on the link are completely determined and classified . by referring their classification",
    ", we immediately obtain the following :    [ cor:(-2,p , p)tor ] under the same setting as in theorem  [ thm : toroidal_kabaya ] , the manifold @xmath20 is the seifert fibered space @xmath21 .",
    "all the other @xmath16 ( i.e. , @xmath1 ) are hyperbolic . in particular , @xmath22 is homeomorphic to the `` figure-8 knot sister manifold '' .",
    "theorem  [ thm : toroidal_kabaya ] and the corollary  [ cor:(-2,p , p)tor ] will be proved in section  [ sec : toroidal ] .",
    "our second result concerns seifert fibered surgeries on such pretzel knots .",
    "for instance , @xmath23 is well - known for it is the first hyperbolic example , which admits non - trivial seifert fibered surgeries  @xcite . on the other hand , in the case",
    "where @xmath24 , we obtain the following :    [ thm : sf_ij ] a pretzel knot @xmath25 with positive integers @xmath26 admits no seifert fibered surgeries .",
    "this will be proved in section 3 by applying a method developed in @xcite by the first two authors .",
    "we note that our theorems together with known facts complete the classification of the exceptional surgeries on @xmath25 with @xmath1 . to see this , and also as a background",
    ", we recall some of known facts on exceptional surgeries on hyperbolic pretzel knots . actually most of the following results concern montesinos knots .",
    "however , for simplicity , we only deal with pretzel knots .",
    "see the original references for precise statements .",
    "wu showed that there are no reducible surgery on hyperbolic pretzel knots  @xcite , and also obtained a complete classification of toroidal surgeries on pretzel knots  @xcite .",
    "if a pretzel knot contains at most two non - integer tangles , then it is equivalent to a two - bridge knot , and then exceptional surgeries on such knots were completely determined in @xcite . on the other hand , if a pretzel knot contains at least four non - integer tangles , then it was also shown by wu  @xcite that such a pretzel knot admits no exceptional surgery .",
    "furthermore , on pretzel knots , the first two authors gave a complete classification of surgeries yielding @xmath27-manifolds with cyclic or finite fundamental groups @xcite , and showed that there are no toroidal seifert surgeries on pretzel knots other than the trefoil  @xcite .",
    "very recently , in @xcite , wu gave several restrictions , in particular , he showed that if a hyperbolic pretzel knot of length three admits an atoroidal seifert fibered surgery , then it is equivalent to @xmath28 with @xmath29 and , up to relabeling , @xmath30  ( * ? ?",
    "* theorem 7.2 ) .",
    "in this section , we give a proof of theorem  [ thm : toroidal_kabaya ] and corollary  [ cor:(-2,p , p)tor ] .",
    "first of all we set up our definitions and notations .    a _ pretzel knot _ of type @xmath31 with integers @xmath32 , denoted by @xmath33 , is defined as a knot admitting a diagram obtained by putting rational tangles of the forms @xmath34 together in a circle .    from a given knot @xmath35 in @xmath4",
    ", we obtain a closed orientable 3-manifold by a _ dehn surgery _ on @xmath35 as follows : remove the interior of a tubular neighborhood @xmath36 of @xmath35 , and glue solid torus back .",
    "the slope ( i.e. , the isotopy class of an unoriented non - trivial simple closed curve ) on the peripheral torus @xmath37 , which is identified with the meridian of the attached solid torus is called the _",
    "surgery slope_. it is well - known that slopes on the torus @xmath37 are parameterized by @xmath38 by using the standard meridian - longitude system for @xmath35 .",
    "thus , when the surgery slope corresponds to @xmath39 , we call the dehn surgery on @xmath35 along the surgery slope the _ @xmath40-dehn surgery _ or _ @xmath40-surgery _ for brevity , and denote the obtained manifold by @xmath41 .",
    "let @xmath35 be the @xmath5-pretzel knot .",
    "put @xmath35 on a genus two surface @xmath42 which bounds two handlebodies in @xmath4 as shown in figure [ fig : pretzel_on_surface ] , denote the ` outside ' of @xmath42 by @xmath43 and the ` inside ' by @xmath44 . the isotopy class on @xmath37 determined by the intersection @xmath45 is called the _ surface slope of @xmath35 with respect to @xmath42_. now the surface slope is @xmath14 .",
    "the manifold obtained from a dehn surgery on @xmath35 along the surface slope is described as follows .",
    "let @xmath46 ( resp .",
    "@xmath47 ) be the manifold obtained from @xmath43 ( resp .",
    "@xmath44 ) by attaching a @xmath48-handle along @xmath35 and @xmath49 .",
    "then the manifold obtained from dehn surgery on @xmath35 with surface slope is homeomorphic to @xmath50 .",
    "the inside @xmath44 contains a properly embedded one - holed klein bottle whose boundary coincides with @xmath35 , and @xmath44 is homeomorphic to the regular neighborhood of the one - holed klein bottle .",
    "therefore @xmath51 is a twisted @xmath2-bundle over the klein bottle and @xmath52 is a torus .",
    "we will show that @xmath53 is obtained by a dehn surgery on the chain - link with three components .    instead of considering the @xmath5-pretzel knots ,",
    "we study the @xmath27-component link depicted in figure [ fig : associated_link ] , which is obtained from the @xmath54-pretzel knot @xmath55 by adding two trivial components @xmath56 and @xmath57 encircling the two half - twisted strands respectively . the @xmath5-pretzel knot is obtained from the link by the @xmath58-surgery along @xmath56 and the @xmath59-surgery along @xmath57 , where @xmath60 and @xmath61 respectively . therefore the manifold @xmath46 is obtained from @xmath43 by attaching a @xmath48-handle along @xmath55 then doing the @xmath58-surgery along @xmath56 and the @xmath59-surgery along @xmath57 .",
    "let @xmath62 be the manifold obtained from @xmath63 by attaching a @xmath48-handle along @xmath55 .",
    "we will show that @xmath62 is homeomorphic to the exterior @xmath64 of the chain - link with three components , and describe the relation between peripheral curves of @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "here we fix the standard meridian and longitude on each component of @xmath65 and we identify slopes with @xmath66 .",
    "take meridian disks @xmath67 and @xmath68 of the outside handlebody @xmath43 as shown in figure [ fig : associated_link ] and cut @xmath43 along @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then remove the regular neighborhood of the two arcs corresponding to @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "cut the resulting manifold along the disks @xmath69 and @xmath70 as indicated in figure [ fig : handle_decomp_1 ] .",
    "this gives a handle decomposition of @xmath62 ( figure [ fig : handle_decomp_2 ] ) .",
    "in figure [ fig : handle_decomp_2 ] , we modify the regions encircled by dotted curves by the operations described in figure [ fig : simplification_1 ]",
    ". then we obtain a simplified handle decomposition of @xmath62 ( figures [ fig : handle_decomp_4 ] and [ fig : handle_decomp_5 ] ) .",
    "we regard the diagram of the handle decomposition given in figure [ fig : handle_decomp_5 ] as a trivalent graph , then taking the dual of this trivalent graph , we obtain a triangulation of the boundary of a @xmath27-ball ( figure [ fig : polyhedron ] ) . in this way",
    "we regard the handle decomposition of @xmath62 as a topological ideal polyhedral decomposition of @xmath62 .",
    "the ideal polyhedron further decomposed into 6 ideal tetrahedra . by using snappea @xcite",
    ", we can check that @xmath62 is obtained from gluing 6 positively oriented ideal tetrahedra , therefore has a hyperbolic structure .",
    "we can also check that there exists an isometry from @xmath62 to the exterior @xmath64 of the chain - link and we confirm that the isometry maps the slope @xmath58 on @xmath71 to the slope @xmath72 on @xmath65 , and similarly for the slope @xmath59 .",
    "this completes the ( computer - aided ) proof , but we also give an explicit homeomorphism between @xmath62 and @xmath64 .",
    "we decompose the chain - link exterior into two `` drums '' according to section 6 of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath73 , @xmath74 and @xmath75 be the disks bounded by the components of the chain - link in the simplest way ( figure [ fig : chain_link ] ) . slicing the exterior @xmath64 along the disks ,",
    "then we obtain a solid torus whose boundary is tiled by quadrilaterals ( figure [ fig : sliced_link_complement ] ) .",
    "this solid torus is decomposed into two drums and further into 6 tetrahedra as shown in figure [ fig : splited_drums ] .",
    "glue together these 6 ideal tetrahedra along the faces which contain the double arrowed edges of figure [ fig : splited_drums ] , we obtain an ideal polyhedron with 12 faces ( figure [ fig : chain_polyhedron ] ) .",
    "since the gluing pattern of the ideal polyhedron is equivalent to the one given in figure [ fig : polyhedron ] , @xmath62 and @xmath64 are homeomorphic .",
    "finally we observe the correspondence between peripheral curves of @xmath62 and @xmath64 . in the polyhedral decomposition of @xmath62",
    "given in figure [ fig : polyhedron ] , a path @xmath76 from the face @xmath77 to the face @xmath78 and a path @xmath79 from the face @xmath67 to the face @xmath80 form a meridian and longitude pair of @xmath56 . here the path corresponding to @xmath76 in @xmath64 is represented by a word of the form @xmath81 and the path corresponding to @xmath79 by @xmath82 , where @xmath83 ( resp .",
    "@xmath81 , @xmath84 ) is an element of the fundamental group of @xmath64 intersecting the disk @xmath73 ( resp .",
    "@xmath74 , @xmath75 ) at once ( figure [ fig : chain_link ] ) .",
    "on the other hand a meridian and longitude pair of the component corresponding to the disk @xmath74 is represented by the words @xmath81 and @xmath85 .",
    "therefore the slope @xmath86 on @xmath56 is mapped to @xmath87 , in particular @xmath58 to @xmath72 . by symmetry",
    ", the slope @xmath59 on @xmath57 is mapped to @xmath88 .",
    "let @xmath64 be the complement of the chain - link with three components , also known as the _ magic manifold_. we denote the @xmath86- and @xmath89-dehn filling of @xmath64 by @xmath90 . since any two components of @xmath65 can be interchanged by an automorphism which preserves the peripheral structure , this notation makes sense .",
    "then , by theorem  [ thm : toroidal_kabaya ] , the manifold @xmath16 is homeomorphic to @xmath91 where @xmath60 and @xmath19 with @xmath92 .    on the other hand , by the result of martelli and petronio @xcite , we know that @xmath93 is hyperbolic except if one of the following occurs up to permutation :    * @xmath94 , * @xmath95 .",
    "thus we see that all the manifolds @xmath16 with @xmath1 ( i.e. , @xmath96 ) are hyperbolic .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath97 , equivalently @xmath98 , it is shown in @xcite that the manifold @xmath99 is homeomorphic to @xmath21 . in particular , the manifold @xmath22 is homeomorphic to @xmath100 , which is the `` figure-8 knot sister manifold '' .",
    "also note that , since @xmath101 is the whitehead sister link ( @xmath102-pretzel link ) , the @xmath103 is obtained from the whitehead sister link .",
    "in this section we give a proof of theorem  [ thm : sf_ij ] .",

    "then by the results in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , @xmath41 must be a seifert fibered manifold with a base orbifold @xmath105 having three singular fibers .",
    "in particular , @xmath41 is atoroidal .",
