    "the dependence of @xmath40 on @xmath8 for a branch of solitons is usually , at least in the case of a fundamental solution , closely related to its stability .",
    "a necessary condition for stability in the case of fundamental multi - component solitons is typically given by a generalized vakhitov - kolokolov ( vk ) criterion @xcite , which often also appears to be a sufficient condition for soliton stability ( see , e.g. , refs .",

    "[ main1 ] , there are also some striking similarities as well .",
    "note that in some respects the model for the ( 1 + 1)d case is simpler since the corresponding stationary system ( [ eq_st ] ) with @xmath32 does not depend explicitly on @xmath73 and hence represents an autonomous dynamical system in four dimensions . finding solitons",
    "is then reduced to finding homoclinic trajectories in this 4d phase space .",

    "we are mainly interested in families with an odd number of separated solitons : @xmath79 , but we also investigate ` bifurcations ' from @xmath77 .",

    "( [ eq_u ] ) consists of two - wave bright symmetric solitons and is described by families of localized beams with coupled fundamental and third harmonics . the simplest way to obtain the lowest order two - wave soliton family",

    "the first expression for @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ casc ] ) is the solution of the corresponding cubic - quintic nls - type equation .",
    "the results of our numerical continuation from this limiting solution , upon decreasing @xmath8 is that , like in the ( 2 + 1)d case , this branch also traces a convoluted path in the @xmath85-plane , involving four ` bifurcations ' from one - wave soliton families ( from the families @xmath76 , @xmath78 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 ) . as in the ( 2 + 1)d case , this branch connects to a self - similar solution at @xmath54 ( the point o in fig .",

    "however , it is here that the similarity with the @xmath92-case ends , as we shall now explain .",
    "first , let us try to motivate what is happening at each of the ` bifurcations ' from @xmath93 ; for which at first sight it seems remarkable that each one occurs precisely at @xmath94 .",
    "standard bifurcation analysis ( e.g.  as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) allows us to find the position of the single bifurcation point from the one - wave soliton family @xmath76 ( [ wo ] ) at @xmath95 ( point c in fig .",
    "[ main2](a ) ) . as in the ( 2 + 1)d case",
    "the bifurcation is a transcritical with one branch emerging to the left of the bifurcation point and one to the right .",
    "this structure is confirmed by the inset to fig .",
    "[ main2](a ) which shows that the branch emerging to the left undergoes a fold ( at point b ) , so that on a larger scale both branches appear to bifurcate to the right .",
    "now it seems that this ` local ' bifurcation from @xmath76 causes a topological change in the four - dimensional phase space so that a global event must also happen at this parameter value .",

    "phenomenologically this is similar to what happens in the shg case when the parameter equivalent to @xmath8 passes through 1 @xcite .",
    "a key observation here is that in order to get a symmetric ( even ) solution , only an odd number of copies of the @xmath76 may be taken to form solitons in this way . as a convenient short - hand for this global bifurcation of multi - peaked solutions at @xmath94",

    ". there are 8 in total if you include the change of sign of both @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    ".    a similar bifurcation picture is observed at @xmath95 for bifurcations from @xmath86 and @xmath87 one - wave families . however , because of the increase of the number in possible one - wave multi - soliton families themselves , the number of the corresponding bifurcated two - component branches also increases . for the even solitons considered in this work we have the following formula to calculate the number of two - wave sub - families bifurcating from one - wave @xmath81 family : @xmath103 ( double that if we count the change signs of @xmath4 and @xmath104 ) .",
    "for example , there are 16 branches that bifurcate from @xmath87 branches which have @xmath105 at @xmath94 .",
    "note that in the bifurcation diagram of fig .",
    "[ main2 ] , in order to clutter , only branches directly linked to the cascading limit two - wave family are shown .",
    "close to bifurcation points , the third harmonic components of the depicted branches have neighboring humps of alternating sign and first harmonic components have all humps of the same sign . note that these branches all bifurcate to the left of @xmath94 .",
    "for the branches which bifurcate to the right not all third harmonic neighboring humps alternate in sign .",
    "it is important to note that none of the multi - hump soliton branches bifurcating to the left of @xmath94 can be viewed as bound states of single partial solitons . indeed , single one - hump solitons of eqs .",
    "( [ eq_u ] ) _ always _ have @xmath4 and @xmath5 components in - phase ( of the same sign ) for @xmath106 , whereas some of the individual humps of the of multi - hump structures bifurcating to the left from @xmath81 ( @xmath80 ) families have @xmath4 and @xmath5 components of different signs . to illustrate this point we show in fig .",

    "as they approach @xmath95 the separation between each individual hump ( a ` partial soliton ' ) increases and the state begins to approach a concatenation of single solitons with slightly overlapping tails",
    ". however , some of these partial solitons have out - of - phase @xmath4 and @xmath5 components and hence _ can not exist _ on their own ( i.e.  without being in superposition with other ` partial ' solitons ) .    fig .",
    "[ figmain2 ] shows something even more striking - that there is also a ` bifurcation ' from the @xmath77 family .",

    "in conclusion , we have investigated and classified higher - order soliton families and bifurcation phenomena due to resonant parametric interaction of a fundamental frequency wave with its third harmonic .    in the case of ( 2 + 1)d solitons",
    "the picture is consistent with standard theories , albeit the branch we followed from the cascading limit connects several distinct soliton types in a non - trivial way .",

    "the first of these is particularly intriguing since not only are symmetric multi - humped states formed in this way , but also asymmetric ones .",

    "stability of the newly discovered soliton families remains an open question , especially for the ( 1 + 1)d case .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that weak parametric interaction of a fundamental beam with its third harmonic field in kerr media gives rise to a rich variety of families of non - fundamental ( multi - humped ) solitary waves . making a comprehensive comparison between bifurcation phenomena for these families in bulk media and planar waveguides </S>",
    "<S> , we discover two novel types of soliton bifurcations and other interesting findings . </S>",
    "<S> the later includes ( i ) multi - humped solitary waves without even or odd symmetry and ( ii ) multi - humped solitary waves with large separation between their humps which , however , may not be viewed as bound states of several distinct one - humped solitons .    2 </S>"
