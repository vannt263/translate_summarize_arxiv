    "we consider the case of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and a bipartite lattice without frustration , i.e. @xmath15 is even when periodic boundary condition is imposed .",
    "we will focus on the strong anisotropic cases , e.g. @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are not readily to be found in real compounds .",
    "recent progress in the technology of cold atoms are encouraging @xcite .",
    "the above model can be translated to an identical hardcore bosonic @xmath18-@xmath19 model by a matsubara - matsuda mapping @xcite . although some experiment on hardcore bosons have been realized @xcite , but the interaction terms in this model need more sophisticated methods to realize @xcite .",
    "one may consider a ladder - shaped optical lattice formed by standing wave lasers @xcite .",
    "the superexchange mechanism could be mimicked by controlled tunneling of cold bosonic or fermionic atoms with two internal states , such as @xmath20rb in @xmath21 or @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is a vacuum . so that we can define a spin on a site in a bilinear form @xmath24 , where @xmath25 , is a pauli matrix and @xmath26 . in the mott insulating phase",

    "we introduce a bond operator representation that will be very useful for elaborating the phenomena we found in this system .",
    "there are four states on each rung , one singlet and three triplets , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , which create the singlet state and triplet states at @xmath6-th rung with the constraint , @xmath31 .",

    "the temperature is taken as @xmath36 and periodic boundary condition is imposed .",

    "we present two slices of phase diagrams to exemplify our results : ( i ) @xmath38 ( figure 1 ) ; ( ii ) @xmath39 ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the properties of the ground states and the low energy excitations are elaborated as follows .",
    "first , let us see two simplest limits .",
    "the first is the full polarized ( fp ) state in large enough field @xmath12 .",
    "the second occurs at @xmath40 , where the hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) reduces to an array of disjoint dimers . in the second limit",
    ", the ground state and excitations are determined by individual dimers .",
    "the energies of singlet and triplets are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 . when @xmath45 , the ground state is an array of singlets ( we call it singlet dimer ( sd ) phase ) with an excitation gap @xmath46 . with the applied field @xmath12 increasing , the system s ground state experiences a transition from sd to fp state at @xmath47 .",
    "if we fix @xmath38 and raise @xmath48 ( @xmath49 ) , a triplon solid ( ts ) phase intervenes between sd and fp phases ( figure 1 ) .",
    "the ts state is a paving of singlets and triplets on the ladders alternatively . to detect the ts order in a general case",
    ", one can define a triplon creation operator @xmath50 acting in spin s hilbert space @xmath51 we have @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 .",
    "it is worth noting that @xmath55 is not a perfect hardcore boson @xcite . but with appropriate model parameters , the hardcore condition could be well fulfilled .",
    "the diagonal real space correlation function of triplon is defined as @xmath56 where the thermodynamic limit @xmath57 is taken . the static structure factor for detecting ts order",
    "is given by @xmath58    from the point of view of renormalization , the @xmath59 and @xmath60 , so that the hamiltonian ( [ hb ] ) at low energy sector can be replaced by @xmath61 where we have defined the pseudo - spin operators in a schwinger boson representation , @xmath62 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian ( [ ts ] ) is nothing but a `` classical ising model in a field '' .",
    "the ts phase is a consequence of the first antiferromagnetic interaction term .",
    "if the second term prevails the first one , sd and fp phases could be reached if @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "we also get the phase boundaries by comparing the ground state energies of the three states : ( i ) @xmath65 for the boundary between sd and ts and ( ii ) @xmath66 between ts and fp .",
    "it is worth to point out that the effective hamiltonian ( [ ts ] ) also gives a good description for ts and fp phase in the phase diagram where @xmath67 .",
    "the consistency between the analytical and numerical results are quite well , as shown in figure 3 .",
    "if @xmath68 , the area of ts phase shrinks to the top right corner of the phase diagram ( figure 2 ) and there emerges a vast gapless phase called luttinger liquid ( ll ) . in isotropic case ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath69 , there have been a large amount of literatures devoted to the study of the ground state and low excitations @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the anisotropic case , @xmath70 , and answer the question whether there is still a region described by ll , which , to our knowledge , is not been discussed before .",
    "we give a positive answer here .",
    "interestingly , the low energy properties in the ll phase are also governed by the states @xmath71 and @xmath72 . but the effective hamiltonian includes a part of `` quantum fluctuations '' besides the `` classical '' part , @xmath73 , @xmath74 .",
    "\\label{ll}\\ ] ] this model is exactly the form of the @xmath0 chain whose properties are well known owing to many reliable methods , such as bethe ansatz and bosonization . we know that its ground state is antiferromagnet or ll when @xmath75 or @xmath76 respectively @xcite . in ll ,",
    "both diagonal and off - diagonal triplon correlations are important .",
    "the former is defined in ( [ spi ] ) .",
    "the latter can be defined as @xmath77 from the effective model ( [ ll ] ) , we can get the equal - time spin correlation by the standard abelian bosonization techniques @xcite , @xmath78 @xmath79 where @xmath80 denotes the lattice distance , @xmath81 are constants , @xmath82 is the uniform magnetization , @xmath83 is the so - called ll parameter with typical value less than @xmath84 that governs the spin correlations at long wavelength limit . for a comparison , we perform the qmc simulation on the original hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) .",
    "we found the spin ladder is sensitive to the value of @xmath85 in ts region .",
    "however , comparing with spin @xmath0 chain , the ts and ll still exist in the phase diagram of the spin ladder only with quantitative changes of phase boundaries .",
    "the densities of four rung states @xmath86 shown in figure 4(b ) confirm the goodness of the effective model ( [ ll ] ) . from the nodes of structure factor @xmath87 in figure 4(a ) , we can see a clear phase transition from ts to ll .",
    "the long range diagonal order in ts also could be seen in the correlation function @xmath88 of figure 4(d ) . in figure 4(c ) we show the power law decay behavior of correlation @xmath89 in ll region , which coincides with the relation ( [ cpm ] ) perfectly .",
    "now we turn to the last phase .",
    "first , we focus on the thermodynamic limit , and the case of @xmath38 ( see figure 1 ) , since the qualitative properties do not change if @xmath85 is not large enough .",
    "we show the ground state phase is a gapped mott insulator of triplon that can be understood quite good by an effective ising model in a transverse field ( t - ising model )",
    ". then we will work on finite system to figure out the low excitations of this phase .",
    "we will show the lowest two states for finite systems are nearly degenerate and tend to be maximally entangled with @xmath90 increasing .",
    "when @xmath12 is small and @xmath91 is large enough , the low energy sector of the system splits into two channels .",
    "the first one ( channel a ) is a classical ising hamiltonian @xmath92 with @xmath93 and constraint @xmath94 .",
    "when @xmath45 , the gound state is an alternative paving of @xmath72 and @xmath95 states along the ladders .",
    "its lowest energy per rung reads @xmath96    the second one ( channel b ) is obtained by introducing a set of pseudo - spin operators in another schwinger boson representation , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 , with constraint @xmath100 , which reads @xmath101 .",
    "\\label{tising}\\ ] ] this is exactly the t - ising model , whose properties are also well - known .",
    "one can solve it exactly by applying the jordan - wigner transformation @xcite , and get the lowest energy per rung , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind . because the field @xmath12 is coupled with @xmath104 and @xmath105",
    ", it does not appear in channel b. in fact , this is the reason why the phase boundary between sd and af phases is a straight line ( see figure 1 and 2 ) that almost does not change with the field increasing for a given @xmath85 until runs into another phase . in the following , combining numerical approaches , we emphasize several important consequences of the above effective hamiltonians .",
    "it is easy to see that the difference of the lowest energies between channels a and b is @xmath106    so we see that channel b truly reflects the ground state of the original ladders system . in the whole parameter region",
    ", channel b gives quite good description of the ground state energy of original system .",
    "the goodness of effective @xmath107 for the ground state has been confirmed by qmc simulations on the original ladders system shown in figure 3 , 4 , and 5 .      in thermodynamic limit and when @xmath108 , the effective hamiltonian @xmath107 exhibits an af phase with double degeneracy , @xmath109 this result needs an assumption of spontaneous symmetry breaking nevertheless .",
    "we will address this issue later .",
    "the staggered magnetization of this phase can be detected by the order parameter @xmath110 there is a quantum phase transition between the sd and af phases at the gapless point @xmath111 , which can be worked out from the divergence point of the second - order derivative of @xmath112 on @xmath91 , as well as the first - order derivative of the weight of singlets @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the lowest excitation spectrum of @xmath107 .",
    "the staggered magnetization @xmath115 is deduced from the correlation function @xmath116 formally , which is too tedious to be presented here .",
    "the smooth curve in figure 5(a ) shows @xmath115 that is obtained by the correlation function with @xmath117 .",
    "comparing it with qmc results , we confirm the validity of the effective hamiltonian @xmath118 .",
    "the phase transition between those two states is of second order , which can be seen from the staggered magnetic susceptibility @xmath119 shown in figure 5(b ) .",
    "is the effective hamiltonian",
    "@xmath107 good enough for low excitations ?",
    "how do the translational and trs breaking happen in the af phase for the original ladders system ? to answer these questions , we performed an exact diagonalization on the original system up to @xmath120 ( i.e. @xmath121 sites ) to reveal the aspect of the original system that may be ignored .",
    "we found , although the effective @xmath107 reflects the ground state of the original system perfectly , the low excitations above the ground state is largely restricted by channel a. the excitation spectrum ( [ wb ] ) of channel b gives an energy gap above its ground state , @xmath122 but the true gap of the original system should not exceed @xmath123 ( see ( [ delta ] ) ) , so in large @xmath124 we have @xmath125     ( labelled by colored markers ) obtained by exact diagonalization and analytical results for a ladder with @xmath57 ( shown by lines ) obtained by effective theories .",
    "the dashed line represents the true gap at large @xmath124 limit . here",
    "@xmath126 and @xmath127 are taken .",
    "please see more details in the text.,width=421 ]    , of the lowest two states , @xmath128 and @xmath129 .",
    "( b ) the percentages , @xmath130 and @xmath131 , of dominant parts in the lowest two states .",
    "please see more in the text.,width=421 ]    the numerical result for @xmath126 is exemplified in figure 6 .",
    "we see the excitations of the ladder system is much different from the effective @xmath107 . in large @xmath91",
    ", we observe no extra energy levels lying between @xmath132 and @xmath112 , which ensures a true gap greater than @xmath133 .",
    "another observation is the lowest two levels of finite systems are not exactly degenerate and not even the ones with af order , @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "instead , they are @xmath136 with dominant parts prevail the residuals .",
    "the numerical results are shown in figure 7 .",
    "we observed that @xmath137 has slightly lower energy than @xmath138 , but their energy difference @xmath139 rapidly reduces to zero with @xmath124 increasing . and ,",
    "at the same time , the two states approach the so - called ghz states @xcite asymptotically , latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\left\\vert \\phi _ { 1}\\right\\rangle   & \\approx & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (    \\left\\vert \\phi _ { 2}\\right\\rangle   & \\approx & \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left (     the result implies the entangled ghz states could be purified if we increase @xmath90 adiabatically for finite system . for long enough system ,",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking may occur and the entanglement will vanish .",
    "nonetheless , the two ghz states do not exhibit a non - zero order parameter @xmath115 , while they do have the same antiferromagnetic spin correlation functions as @xmath134 and @xmath141 .",
    "that is the reason why we name it a non - trivial af phase .",
    "one can check that @xmath137 and @xmath142 are eigenstates of the time reversal operator @xmath143 where @xmath144  is the complex conjugation , if noticing that @xmath145 thus @xmath137 and @xmath146 preserve the exact trs as the same as the original hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) . from the point of view of the effective @xmath107 , the assumption of spontaneous symmetry breaking in thermodynamic limit is based an unpredictable disturbance from environment @xcite .",
    "but here we have one favorable factor to avoid this - the destructive field should couple to local variables , @xmath147 , delicately since the system with true gap is antiferromangetic .",
    "thus we think there is the chance to realize such entangled states that do not break the trs .",
    "the dimer @xmath0 spin system discussed in this paper might be realized in a mott insulating phase of cold bosonic atoms in near future @xcite . we can estimate the typical energy scales . for @xmath20rb atoms with a lattice constant @xmath148 nm and about @xmath149 atoms in a bose - einstein condensate , we can chose @xmath150 khz ( corresponding to a time scale of 10 ms ) with a conservative choice of @xmath151 @xmath152 khz and @xmath153 , where @xmath18 is the hopping strength of cold atoms between two nearest neighbor minimums of laser potential and @xmath154 is on site interaction originating from the @xmath155 wave scattering .",
    "these energy scales are clearly compatible with current experiments @xcite and make the system in a mott insulating area . in experiment , the density of condensates in momentum space @xmath156 can be measured by noise correlations which can be linked to spin - spin correlations @xcite .",
    "we can use bragg scattering of light , which gives rise to the spin structure factor , to detect @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "an alternative technique for imaging spin states in optical lattices has been put forward @xcite .",
    "thus , all the phases discussed in this paper are detectable in experiment .",
    "in summary , combining analytical and numerical methods , we have investigated the ground state phase diagrams and low excitations of the dimer @xmath0 spin ladder system .",
    "we show that most features of the phases could be understood within the frame of bond operator theory and have proven it by using quantum monte carlo method .",
