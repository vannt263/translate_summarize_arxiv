    "the masses of active neutrinos are the most prominent evidence for physics beyond the standard model .",

    "right - handed neutrinos have been searched for a long time at various experiments and observations ( for compilations , see refs .",
    "their detectability is determined by two parameters : masses and mixings .    in this letter",
    ", we derive upper and lower bounds on the mixing of the lightest right - handed neutrino .",
    "the lower bound comes from the seesaw relation , and the upper one is from the perturbativity . to obtain the upper bound , we take into account the cancellation between the contributions of right - handed neutrinos to the mass matrix of active neutrinos .",
    "we also consider the renormalization group evolution ( rge ) of yukawa couplings .",
    "the new upper bound is stronger than the existing bounds by orders of magnitude for many cases .",
    "this bound is crucial for future collider searches @xcite .",
    "the perturbativity of the neutrino yukawa couplings without rge was discussed in ref .",
    "the rge effect was partially studied in the context of grand unification @xcite .",
    "note that stronger bounds may be derived by the vacuum stability condition @xcite , but it largely depends on the top yukawa coupling and the details of the scalar sector .",
    "here we focus on the perturbativity to be conservative .",
    "our results do not change much even if we assume the stability .",
    "we consider the standard model extended by right - handed neutrinos @xmath2 .",
