    "since the realization by bhalerao and liu @xcite that the @xmath2 interaction is relatively attractive the next step was an anticipation of possible @xmath0-nuclear ( quasi)bound states @xcite . in spite of intense searches , so far no unambiguous experimental evidence has been brought up to support these expectationsmg . ] . also theoretical predictions are mixed , varying from bound states for nuclei only heavier than carbon to claims of binding for @xmath5he or even @xmath1he .",
    "the existence of bound states is closely related to scattering , in particular to the low energy expansion by the scattering length and effective range @xmath6 where , with the convention normal in meson physics , a positive @xmath7 indicates moderate attraction , while a negative value means repulsion or a bound state .",
    "unfortunately , this relation is predictive only in theory , since experimentally the cross section in scattering or in production final state interactions ( fsi ) can not distinguish the sign of the real part .",
    "however , as pointed out earlier by haider and liu , actually the condition for complex potentials is more restrictive and also @xmath8 should be valid @xcite . by unitarity ,",
    "the imaginary part @xmath9 is always positive . in ref .",
    "@xcite this condition was pushed to the next order in @xmath10 with the condition @xmath11 > 0 \\ ; , \\label{condition}\\ ] ] which reduces to the former one , if @xmath12 . from these conditions ( albeit with the bold assumption that @xmath13 ) one can see that also the imaginary part of the scattering length has an essential role even for the very existence of bound states , not to say anything about their width .",
    "for this reason a detailed study and understanding of also the imaginary part of the @xmath0-nuclear scattering length is relevant .",
    "in fact , a very strong correlation between @xmath14 and the binding properties has been seen for nuclei ranging from helium to magnesium in refs .",
    "@xcite giving constraints for the latter in the region of @xmath15 plane where bound states could exist .",
    "this means that the fsi data can yield information on the potential bound states only on the condition that they exist - anyhow a possible starting point to make meaningful guesses in searches for binding observables from scattering data .",
    "theoretical calculations for the low energy parameters to compare with experimental fsi effects are also very varied even for the lightest real nucleus @xmath1he studied most intensively ( for a review see _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "in addition to the wide variation of the predicted real part in the case of @xmath1he another problem is the predicted imaginary part , which is often large .",
    "this is a problem for two reasons .",
    "firstly , obviously the bound state could be too broad for observation .",
    "secondly , even if @xmath7 were negative , the above condition ( [ condition ] ) for the existence of a bound state may not be satisfied with a large imaginary part .",
    "therefore , the large predicted imaginary parts are a bad prospect for finding bound @xmath0-nuclear states .",
    "however , there are indications about unexpectedly small imaginary parts from the meta - analysis @xcite on @xmath1he and later experiments and analyses of the @xmath16he reaction @xcite and the @xmath17he final state studied in @xmath18 interactions making use of unpolarized beams @xcite as well as polarized beams @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite a reanalysis of existing data on the @xmath19he system was presented .",
    "these data stem from the reaction @xmath20 and the extraction of the scattering length was based on the standard low energy expression of the final state interaction @xmath21 where the original production amplitude @xmath22 is assumed to be very short ranged and essentially momentum independent .",
    "the global fit to then available data gave the result @xmath23 fm .",
    "it should still be stressed that this analysis can not determine the sign of the real part , which only appears in the second power .",
    "further , this result is fully consistent with a coupled channel @xmath24-matrix analysis of ref . @xcite yielding @xmath25 fm . in both cases",
    "the imaginary part is smaller than most theoretical predictions .",
    "these values may be contrasted with the seemingly contradictory results of two different more recent high - precision experiments at cosy @xmath26 fm ( cosy-11 @xcite ) and @xmath27 fm ( anke @xcite ) . in analyses",
    "the latter group also considers the smearing over the beam energy profile leading to the larger real part .",
    "further , the latter data allow also the extraction of the effective range @xmath28 fm giving a better fit than without this term @xcite .",
    "the theoretical necessity of this term has been stressed as well in ref . @xcite as above in eq .",
    "[ condition ] .",
    "further support for a small imaginary part may be derived from an overall result for @xmath17he scattering length @xmath29 fm @xcite .",
    "it is very interesting and suggestive also to note that , if the real part for @xmath5he is really smaller in magnitude than for @xmath1he , the behaviour indicates binding for @xmath5he ( without any conclusion for @xmath1he ) .",
    "the reason is that the heavier nucleus is probably more attractive and , in the nonbinding situation , its scattering length should be larger . if the binding threshold is passed , there is no constraint on the magnitude any more .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate possible justification for the smallness of @xmath30 .",
    "first for the @xmath2 interaction the standard static optical potential model is replaced by a coupled channels model with an assumed explicit coupling of the @xmath2 system to the pion - nucleon system in a totally phenomenological way but giving the same elementary @xmath2 scattering lengths is supposed to be strongly coupled to the @xmath31 baryon resonance leading to @xmath32 .",
    "this would give energy dependence over a wider range .",
    "however , this work is not concerned about this microscopic mechanism , but just a direct coupling to @xmath32 is assumed .",
    "the energy dependence due to the @xmath33 might influence the effective range term . ] . normally the nuclear density profile is used to spread the @xmath34 interaction over the nucleus leading to single channel optical potentials , essentially neglecting the effect of nucleon correlations and other nuclear `` granularity '' as well as excitations .",
    "now , in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] this averaging approach is generalized to a sort of a two channel optical model .",
    "while the limit of a complex optical potential could , in principle , be total absorption ( `` black sphere '' ) , in the case of explicit two channels there is a feedback effect . with the stronger nuclear interaction",
    "this could make a difference by an earlier saturation of the absorption , even though for scattering from a single nucleon the zero energy results would be the same .",
    "another factor could be the longer range of a nucleus _ vs. _ the large wave number of the pionic channel . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] this turns out to be the most important effect . with a single channel optical potential the size of the nucleus",
    "does not play a particularly important role in zero - energy scattering , but for the coupled high momentum pion channel the soft form factor decreases the transition probability dramatically .",
    "in line with the simple optical approach @xcite the @xmath2 and @xmath0-nuclear potential can be expressed as @xmath35 with @xmath36 the reduced mass of the @xmath2 system and @xmath37 the nuclear density ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 in fm ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite the strength parameters are taken to be the complex scattering length .",
    "this form is used to produce the @xmath2 scattering length .",
    "unfortunately , this quantity may not be very well known with values for its real part varying roughly between about 0.25 fm ( _ e.g. _ chiral models @xcite ) and about 1 fm ( _ e.g. _ k matrix methods @xcite ) and the imaginary part between 0.2 fm and 0.4 fm .",
    "an up - to - date listing can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . however , most of the analyses for @xmath2 scattering length yield the magnitude of the imaginary part roughly equal to one half of the real part .",
    "k matrix methods tend to give lower ratios down to a quarter and chiral models higher , but in this calculation , just to compare the effect in nuclei for _ scattering length equivalent elementary interactions _",
    ", the ratio is kept as one half .",
    "so @xmath40 and the strengths @xmath38 and @xmath39 will be varied so that @xmath41 covers the interval 0.2  1 fm . in the case of the elementary interaction",
    "the range is obviously short , rather dictated by the size of the hadrons . in this case",
    "the density profile is taken simply as a normalized gaussian @xmath42/(\\sqrt{\\pi}\\ , b)^3\\ , , \\label{etanprof}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 is the range parametre and @xmath44 .    in the simplest static optical potential the strength parameters @xmath38 and @xmath39",
    "are sometimes taken to be the components of the zero energy elementary amplitude ( _ i.e. _ the scattering length @xmath45 as in ref .",
    "this may be thought of as spreading over the nuclear size the scattering strength from single nucleons .",
    "an implicit background assumption could be a density profile of dirac s @xmath46-functions , point - like sources .",
    "however , it was numerically found that this assumption can not be used for a potential approach .",
    "it was impossible to make the range @xmath43 arbitrarily small in the schrdinger equation for any constant strength @xmath38 .",
    "this is due to the fact that qualitatively a condition for bound states ( and the associated singularities in the scattering length ) with varying potential strength and range is that the well - depth times the squared range should be larger than some constant .",
    "( in the case of a square well @xmath47 . ) however , making the range smaller , but at the same time increasing the normalization constant as required by the @xmath46-function limit , causes the well effectively to deepen inversely to the cube of the range , as can be seen from eq .",
    "[ etanprof ] and the above binding condition will be met .",
    "( for a real square well the resulting binding condition would be @xmath48 and presently for the gaussian @xmath49 . ) with still decreasing range more bound states and scattering length singularities would appear and pass .",
    "the importance of the distortions in the context of short - ranged strong interactions has been discussed in _",
    "e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite in the case of repulsive interactions , but the effect for attraction is even more drastic and achieving",
    "a @xmath46-function meaningfully seems impossible .    for the coupled channels interaction the model to be used is similar , but in eq .",
    "( [ potential ] ) the strengths will be matrices . in that case @xmath38 is replaced by a diagonal @xmath50 matrix and @xmath39 effectively by an off - diagonal @xmath51 transition matrix .",
    "let s denote its strength as @xmath52 for coupling .",
    "since both the real and imaginary parts of the @xmath2 scattering lengths can be described by just two interactions , for the present discussion only the interactions primary to the @xmath2 sector are considered , _",
    "i.e. _ the diagonal @xmath32 potential is neglected .",
    "this is purely a practical choice to avoid inessential complications in the present intent to point out in principle the important difference between single- and two - channel optical potentials .",
    "the omission , of course , influences @xmath32 scattering , which , anyway , would give mainly an overall elastic extra phase to the transition matrix .",
    "being attractive , added to the @xmath53 mass difference in eq .",
    "[ pinequ ] the @xmath32 potential would increase locally the already large @xmath32 wave number , further decreasing the transition matrix as will be discussed later , and corroborating the case even more .",
    "also its secondary effect to the inelasticity is anyway to some extent assimilated by the phenomenological variation of @xmath39 and @xmath52 .",
    "it may be noted in passing that in @xmath32 scattering the @xmath2 threshold in the energy region close to the @xmath53 mass difference ( and the @xmath31 ) causes strong attractive peaking taken automatically into account by coupled channels even without an explicit diagonal potential in this channel .",
    "the single channel schrdinger equation is perfectly standard @xmath54 with @xmath55 the complex @xmath0 potential ( [ potential ] ) , @xmath56 its kinetic energy and @xmath57 the relevant reduced mass .    in the case of the coupled model",
    "also the pion wave function appears into the radial equation ( @xmath58-wave ) @xmath59 with @xmath60 the transition potential ( of strength @xmath52 ) and @xmath57 the relevant reduced mass .",
    "the light pion with the total energy equal to the @xmath0 mass can not be handled by the same equation but the relativistic version ( klein - gordon equation ) is more relevant . here",
    "the local momentum is represented by the modified einstein relation @xmath61 leading in the lowest order in @xmath62 and @xmath63 to @xmath64 in the transition term of the pionic channel the @xmath0 mass has been replaced by the reduced mass of the first channel for hermiticity .",
    "it should be noted that in the calculation of the elementary scattering this strength is anyway a freely adjustable parameter and for nuclear scattering the difference is not large . as already mentioned the diagonal @xmath65 term will be neglected . from the asymptotics",
    "one gets for the free pion momentum @xmath66 to be used in the asymptotic boundary conditions .",
    "the procedure is then , after finding the numerical correspondence between the elementary @xmath67 or @xmath68 giving the same @xmath69 for both models , to use the strengths thus obtained for a given @xmath14 to calculate nuclear scattering with more extensive nuclear density profiles ( normalized to @xmath70 ) .",
    "this means simply summing the potentials of individual nucleons and phenomenologically smoothing the resultant total potential to the nucleon density in the philosophy of single channel optical potentials .",
    "this is not , however , in detail quite the same as in _ e.g. _ ref .",
    "@xcite , where the scattering lengths were used as the strengths instead of @xmath2 potentials .",
    "rather this is the `` direct '' interaction part for the optical potential @xcite .",
    "the simple smooth averaging process necessarily suppresses quite a lot of microscopic structure mechanisms .",
    "still in this respect the present treatment is no worse or better than the conventional optical potential model of ref .",
    "the point of this calculation is to show that the explicit inclusion of the low - threshold @xmath71-nuclear channel with large momentum is essentially different from the treatment of the inelasticity by the imaginary potential component in the @xmath0-nucleus channel , leading to its strong decrease .",
    "this fundamental difference seems to have been largely overlooked so far in @xmath0-nuclear discussions .",
    "now , in the coupled case with the enhanced nuclear transition potential the feedback effect from pions should be larger and consequently the inelasticity could be smaller than in the direct single - channel optical model .",
    "in fact , quantum mechanically the strong coupling limit should be to share the probability of @xmath0 s and pions equally instead of formally total absorption in the optical model limit .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that strong absorption is nonlinear in @xmath39 and quite complex .",
    "the imaginary potential eats the wave function off and acts like repulsion causing correlations , which tend to saturate possible inelasticity as seen _",
    "e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0-nuclei and in even stronger annihilation of antinucleons @xcite .",
    "another effect to corroborate the expectation of weaker absorption in the coupled model is the large wave number in the pionic channel ( minimum 2.7 @xmath72 ) forcing by oscillations the relevant transition matrix to decrease for smooth long ranged nuclear potentials .",
    "in fact , as seen later numerically this effect can be a decrease of inelasticity by orders of magnitude and in the momentum representation would be considered to be a form factor effect .",
    "if the @xmath32 diagonal potential is included , its effect would be to change the wave number somewhat , with attraction effectively increasing its value .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , trying to make the @xmath2 interaction range infinitesimally small is impractical or even impossible .",
    "so as the finite extension @xmath43 in eq .",
    "( [ etanprof ] ) 0.3 fm is adopted at first . for this choice",
    "the strength parameter @xmath38 varies roughly between 0.14  0.28 fm in the case of the single channel optical potential and between 0.10  0.25 fm for coupled channels to produce the values of @xmath41 in the interval 0.2  1.0 fm .",
    "the imaginary ( or coupling ) strength varies between 0.04  0.03 fm and 0.14  0.12 fm , respectively .",
    "it may be noted that without absorption and the subsequent effective repulsion the upper values would be close to a binding strength for such a short range , as discussed earlier .",

    "solid : single channel optical model , dashed : coupled channels .",
    "the two values of the @xmath2 range parameter @xmath43 are indicated .",
    "[ nuclength ] ]    as the most relevant and most investigated nucleus @xmath1he is used as an example with a gaussian profile as given in eq .",
    "( [ etanprof ] ) but using the range parameter @xmath74 fm with the root - mean - square radius of 1.9 fm and the normalization to @xmath75 @xcite .",
    "the results for the real and imaginary parts of the nuclear scattering length is given in fig .",
    "[ nuclength ] as functions of the elementary @xmath76 .",
    "while the real parts differ only moderately , in the imaginary parts there is a dramatic difference of more than two orders of magnitude ( solid _ vs. _ dashed ) .",
    "this decrease is interesting , even though the real parts in this case remain positive , _",
    "i.e. _ nonbinding .    to investigate the origin of the drastic drop in the imaginary part of the nuclear scattering length the calculation of the effect is divided into a study of two possible mechanisms indicated previously .",
    "first the effect of changing the strength only is shown , then a change only in the range .",
    "the varying is performed superficially by a multiplicative factor acting on both model strengths @xmath67 or @xmath68 giving originally the same single elementary scattering length a(@xmath77 = ( 0.55 + 0.27 i ) fm .",
    "the optical model strength for this is @xmath78 fm and coupling @xmath79 fm .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ facfig ] .",
    "it can be seen that as the strength @xmath67 or @xmath68 doubles , both the real and imaginary parts experience qualitatively strong variation .",
    "the real part on the left shows first strong attraction changing quickly into apparent repulsion with sharp maxima in both models .",
    "this behaviour could also reflect a complex bound state , as this limit for the very short ranged interaction is close .",
    "( of course , the elementary interaction does not support this . ) the imaginary part on the right - hand panel goes through a sharp peak in the same interval .",
    "apparently the strong absorption causes the change into effective repulsion .",
    "also the maximum expresses a saturation of absorption .",
    "although these strength varying curves are qualitatively similar for both models , it is noteworthy that for a stronger interaction the coupled channel result has a much smaller imaginary part .",
    "if the strength of several nucleons were concentrated within the elementary range , the coupled channels would give less absorption according to this calculation .",
    "scattering lengths for an optical potential ( solid ) _ vs. _ coupled model ( dashed ) as a function of strength and range .",
    "the elementary @xmath2 models yielding the same scattering length ( 0.55 + 0.27 i ) fm have been modified varying either the strength or range by a multiplicative factor between 0 and 5 .",
    "the curves starting from 0 vary the strength , whereas those starting discontinuously from factor 1 correspond to varying the range .",
    "[ facfig ] ]    however , real nuclei have an extension much larger than 0.3 fm .",
    "the less dramatically behaving curves starting from `` factor '' @xmath80 describe corresponding changes due to multiplying the range by this factor .",
    "( it does not make sense to study smaller ranges . )",
    "the behaviour of the real part is now smooth and similar in both models .",
    "also the imaginary part does not look particularly spectacular , but it is important to note that in the case of coupled channels the vanishing with increasing range is very much faster than for the optical potential , which , combined with the strength variation , could account for the unexpectedly small result for @xmath1he .",
    "it may further be noted that with the gaussian distribution the upper limit in the figure would actually closely correspond to the nuclear @xmath1he distribution with `` factor '' = 5.17 . for this value of `` factor ''",
    "the imaginary part @xmath9 in the coupled channels model is already vanishingly small .    in the case of real nuclei",
    "both effects play their roles .",
    "the nuclear size increases with @xmath70 as well as the strength does .",
    "the latter , however , is moderated by the volume ( and hence by the range ) and eventually saturates .",
    "the influence of the size can be thought as a form factor effect for the case of coherent inelasticity with the nucleus remaining intact .",
    "this is actually an inherent assumption in the simplistic optical model with the potential described as being proportional to the density , but the form factor effect really hits only in the explicit inelastic pion channel with a large wave number , not on the low energy @xmath0 meson .",
    "such a strong suppressing effect for pionic inelasticity was already suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite as a ratio of the nuclear and elementary form factors .    it is time to discuss the model dependence .",
    "the basic interaction has been taken so far very short - ranged to simulate a @xmath46-function potential .",
    "as discussed , this has problems .",
    "also the drastic behaviour in fig .",
    "[ facfig ] might be an artifact due to this .",
    "therefore , next the same calculation is repeated with the range @xmath81 fm , which is certainly reasonably large .",
    "the corresponding results are also shown in fig .",
    "[ nuclength ] . now",
    "the size of both the real and imaginary parts is much larger , since - with the longer range as discussed before in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] - the elementary strength also must be larger and this factor is conveyed to the nuclear potential ( whose range is not changed ) .",
    "although this change with the range is even qualitative , still the imaginary part remains much smaller in the coupled case than for the optical one over the whole range of realistic values of the elementary scattering length .",
    "the smallness of the imaginary part is further emphasized by the larger size of the real part for the coupled - channel calculation .",
    "the rapid rise of @xmath82 for @xmath83 fm combined with a large maximum in the real part is associated with the onset of a narrow bound state for @xmath84 fm .",
    "qualitatively the behaviour of @xmath85 would be similar to fig .",
    "[ facfig ] though with numerically much larger values , if this threshold is passed .    next the numerical ( in)significance of the neglect of the diagonal potential in the @xmath71-nucleus channel",
    "was checked by a short calculation .",
    "the addition into this channel of the same rather strong attraction as for @xmath0 increased the real part of the scattering length slightly , a few per cent in the lower half of the @xmath86 range and up to 10 - 20% in the upper half .",
    "the already very small imaginary part was roughly halved .",
    "this may be regarded as confirmation of the expectation presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] .",
    "another aspect of model dependence in the above calculation is that pionic inelasticity is not the only one in the @xmath2 system . about a quarter of inelasticity",
    "can be due to two - pion final states to be taken into account in any more realistic coupled optical model .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the reported branching ratios of the @xmath87 , 50% to @xmath2 and 13% into @xmath88 @xcite ) .",
    "its influence is estimated by adding to the coupled channels calculation also an imaginary @xmath2 potential .",
    "the strength of this additional potential is taken from the conventional optical potential model yielding this fraction .",
    "actually about one quarter of the earlier imaginary part @xmath89 turns out to be a fairly good value .",
    "then the new complex coupled model becomes too absorptive ( and less attractive ) and its transition potential must be reduced to yield still @xmath90 .",
    "the elementary scattering length changes only by a few percent giving credibility to this procedure .",
    "the results of this modification are shown in fig .",
    "[ twopi ] for the @xmath91he scattering length with the two values of the elementary range parameter @xmath92 fm and 0.6 fm . as expected , because of the sensitivity to the optical potential for small coupling strengths the imaginary part increases significantly , even qualitatively .",
    "however , for the most reasonable values of the elementary scattering length it still remains much smaller than for the pure optical model results ( solid curves in the right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ nuclength ] ) .",
    "also one may note the generally increased size of the real part in both coupled models , though the sharp peaking is smeared quite a lot with this moderate extra absorption .",
    "he scattering length for the coupled model as a function of the elementary @xmath2 scattering length supplemented by an optical potential to account for the inelasticity to two pions .",
    "the solid curves present the real part for two values of the elementary range while the dashed ones are for the imaginary part .",
    "[ twopi ] ]    since it has been seen that the size of the nucleus is of paramount importance in the coupled channel model of inelasticity , it would be interesting also to consider scattering from an even larger nucleus . as a representative example",
    "let us take @xmath93c , where binding is unanimously assumed .",
    "for this the modified harmonic oscillator of ref .",
    "@xcite may be used as the density profile @xmath94 \\exp{[-(r/1.672\\,{\\rm fm})^2]}\\ ; { \\rm fm}^{-3}\\ ] ] with the normalization @xmath95 .",
    "accordingly the optical , the pure coupled channel and the smeared coupled channels models are applied to produce fig .",
    "[ carbon ] but now only with the more realistic range parameter @xmath81 fm . in this case",
    "one may note that the real part is negative as it should be for a binding potential .",
    "the singular threshold is below @xmath96 fm , so the magnitude of both real and imaginary parts is decreasing instead of increasing as in fig .",
    "[ nuclength ] .",
    "again the pure coupled channels model gives an extremely small imaginary part , except very close to the binding threshold just below the interaction strengths present in the figure .",

    "[ carbon ] ]    it is noteworthy that for fairly well binding strong interactions both coupled channel models give smaller imaginary parts than the single channel optical one .",
    "this gives hope for distinguishing fairly narrow states , if the binding is strong enough .",
    "however , in the weaker end of the elementary interaction ( @xmath97 fm ) the peaking of the coupled channels result for @xmath98 ( with larger magnitude of the real part ) means also a smaller binding energy in the coupled case making the threshold final state interaction enhancement in @xmath0 production very sharp and the binding energy possibly also smaller than the width . here",
    "the largish scattering length makes it possible to use the low - energy expansion for the complex bound state energy @xmath99 to estimate these . for the most realistic model ( the combination of the optical and coupled channels ) with @xmath100 fm the real and imaginary parts are , indeed , comparable , but already @xmath101 fm seems feasible with @xmath102 mev . for strong",
    "binding , when @xmath103 , the meaning of this simple approximation becomes dubious even though the imaginary parts are small , meaning , in principle , a narrow state .",
    "it shows the general importance of also the effective range .",
    "a coupled channels generalization of the optical potential has been applied to low energy @xmath0-nuclear scattering to study the effect of the pionic inelasticity more explicitly .",
    "compared with the simple single - channel optical model a strong decrease was seen in the imaginary part of the scattering length , though the elementary @xmath2 interactions had been adjusted to give the same scattering lengths and the same procedure was used to relate the @xmath0-nuclear interaction profiles and strengths . in fig .",
    "[ facfig ] this decrease was traced to both a possible increase of the transition strength in nuclei _ vs.",

    "i.e. _ on the relation of the elementary to the nuclear form factor as anticipated earlier @xcite , but for the range of values normally considered reasonable for the elementary amplitude @xcite the conclusion appears valid .",

    "[ sec : model ] and [ sec : results ] the seemingly important simplification of omitting the diagonal @xmath32 channel potential should not change the main conclusion of significantly reduced @xmath0-nuclear inelasticity in this two - channel extension of the optical model in comparison against the single - channel approach . further , there is no apparent reason how or why the extension of the optical model considered here would change the phenomenological and numerical connection between the low - energy scattering parameters and @xmath0-nuclear binding properties @xcite .    as a cautionary note one should , however , remember that the simple optical model potential ( also with the present extension ) , being proportional to the nuclear density , does not formally take into account the change of the nucleus and its wave function ( _ e.g. _ by removal of a recoil nucleon ) , so calculations to overcome this restriction would be desirable . clearly nuclear low - energy excitations can not be addressed by this kind of phenomenologically averaged optical potential approach either .",
    "such excitations can be important already as recoil effects in the pionic channel .",
    "further , as shown _ e.g. _ in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bound - state properties are also affected by subthreshold medium effects , which are not directly and obviously dealt with above - threshold scattering . of course , after averaging over the @xmath2 interactions in the nuclear environment to get the smooth optical potential ( both single - channel and coupled channels ) one misses the close - encounter peaks , sort of nuclear granularity . as in nuclear interactions",
    "one might consider the average to contain the majority leaving an uneven , perhaps perturbative residual interaction .",
    "this may not be a problem with the very low - energy @xmath0 s with long wave length and coarse resolution in the standard optical model .",
    "however , in the case of the high pion momenta of the coupled channels even this lowered roughness can be important , contributing perhaps more than the smooth transition potential considered here ( as the inclusion of the two - pion inelasticity did ) . still , in spite of these criticisms",
    ", if the two different optical models presented in this paper can give such a drastic change of inelasticity , it is feasible that some amount of @xmath0-nuclear inelasticity may be reduced by an explicit coupled equation treatment of the open pion - nuclear channel even in more comprehensive calculations so that the small imaginary parts referred to in the introduction would become comprehensible ."
