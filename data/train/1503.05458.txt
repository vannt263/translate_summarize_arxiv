    "deception has always garnered attention in popular culture , from the deception that planted a seed of anguish in shakespeare s macbeth to the deception that drew viewers to the more contemporary television series _ lie to me_. our human experience seems to be permeated by deception , which may even be engrained into human beings via evolutionary factors @xcite .",
    "yet humans are famously bad at detecting deception @xcite .",
    "an impressive body of research aims to improve these rates , especially in interpersonal situations .",
    "many investigations involve leading subjects to experience an event or recall a piece of information and then asking them to lie about it @xcite .",
    "researchers have shown that some techniques can aid in detecting lies - such as asking a suspect to recall events in reverse order @xcite , asking her to maintain eye contact @xcite , asking unexpected questions or strategically using evidence @xcite .",
    "clearly , detecting interpersonal deception is still an active area of research .    while understanding interpersonal deception is difficult , studying deception in cyberspace has its set of unique challenges . in cyberspace , information can lack permanence , typical cues to deception found in physical space can be missing , and it can be difficult to impute responsibility @xcite .",
    "consider , for example , the problem of identifying deceptive opinion spam in online markets .",
    "deceptive opinion spam consists of comments made about products or services by actors posing as customers , when they are actually representing the interests of the company concerned or its competitors .",
    "the research challenge is to separate comments made by genuine customers from those made by self - interested actors posing as customers .",
    "this is difficult for humans to do unaided ; two out of three human judges in @xcite failed to perform significantly better than chance . to solve this problem ,",
    "the authors of @xcite make use of approaches including a tool called the _",
    "linguistic inquiry word count _ , an approach based on the frequency distribution of part - of - speech tags , and third approach which uses a classification based on _ n_-grams .",
    "this highlights the importance of an interdisciplinary approach to studying deception , especially in cyberspace .",
    "although an interdisciplinary approach to studying deception offers important insights , the challenge remains of putting it to work in a quantitative framework . in behavioral deception experiments , for instance",
    ", the incentives to lie are also often poorly controlled , in the sense that subjects may simply be instructed to lie or to tell the truth @xcite .",
    "this prohibits a natural setting in which subjects could make free choices .",
    "these studies also can not make precise mathematical predictions about the effect of deception or deception - detecting techniques @xcite .",
    "understanding deception in a quantitative framework could help to give results rigor and predictability .    to achieve this rigor and predictability , we analyze deception through the framework of game theory .",
    "this framework allows making quantitative , verifiable predictions , and enables the study of situations involving free choice ( the option to deceive or not to deceive ) and well - defined incentives @xcite .",
    "specifically , the area of incomplete information games allows modeling the information asymmetry that forms part and parcel of deception . in a signaling game",
    ", a receiver observes a piece of private information and communicates a message to a receiver , who chooses an action .",
    "the receiver s best action depends on his belief about the private information of the sender .",
    "but the sender may use strategies in which he conveys or does not convey this private information .",
    "it is natural to make connections between the signaling game terminology of pooling , separating , and partially - separating equilibria and deceptive , truthful , and partially - truthful behavior .",
    "thus , game theory provides a suitable framework for studying deception .    beyond analyzing equilibria",
    ", we also want to design solutions that control the environment in which deception takes place .",
    "this calls for the reverse game theory perspective of _ mechanism design_. in mechanism design , exogenous factors are manipulated in order to design the outcome of a game . in signaling games , these solutions might seek to obtain target utilities or a desired level of information communication . if the deceiver in the signaling game has the role of an adversary - for problems in security or privacy , for example - a defender often wants to design methods to limit the amount of deception . but defenders may also use deception to their advantage . in this case , it is the adversary who may try to implement mechanisms to mitigate the effects of the deception .",
    "a more general mechanism design perspective for signaling games could consider other ways of manipulating the environment , such as feedback and observation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : a - general - framework ] ) .    a general framework for mechanism design .",
    "manipulating the environment in which deception takes place in a signaling game could include adding additional blocks as well as manipulating exogenous parameters of the game . in general , type @xmath0 can be manipulated by input from a _ controller _ before reaching the sender . the controller can rely on an _ observer _ to estimate unknown states . in this paper",
    ", we specifically study the roll of a _ detector _ , which compares type to message and emits evidence for deception .",
    "]    in this paper , we study deception in two different frameworks .",
    "the first framework is a typical game of costless communication between a sender and receiver known as _ cheap - talk_. in the second framework , we add the element of deception detection , forming a game of _ cheap - talk with evidence_. this latter model includes a move by nature after the action of the sender , which yields evidence for deception with some probability . in order provide a concrete example , we consider a specific use of deception for defense , and the employment of antideceptive techniques by an attacker . in this scenario ,",
    "a defender uses honeypots disguised as normal systems to protect a network , and an adversary implements honeypot detection in order to strike back against this deception .",
    "we give an example of how an adversary might obtain evidence for deception through a timing classification known as _",
    "fuzzy benchmarking_. finally , we show how network defenders need to bolster their capabilities in order to maintain the same results in the face of honeypot detection .",
    "this mechanism design approach reverses the mappings from adversary power to evidence detection and evidence detection to game outcome .",
    "although we apply it to a specific research problem , our approach is quite general and can be used in deceptive interactions in both interpersonal deception and deception in cyber security .",
    "our main contributions include 1 ) developing a model for signaling games with deception detection , and analyzing how this model includes traditional signaling games and complete information games as special cases , 2 ) demonstrating that the ability to detect deception causes pure strategy equilibria to disappear under certain conditions , and 3 ) showing that deception detection by an adversary could actually increase the utility obtained by a network defender .",
    "these results have specific implications for network defense through honeypot deployment , but can be applied to a large class of strategic interactions involving deception in both physical and cyberspace .    the rest of the paper proceeds as follows .",
    "section [ sec : cheap - talk - signaling - games ] reviews cheap - talk signaling games and the solution concept of perfect bayesian nash equilibrium .",
    "we use this framework to analyze the honeypot scenario in section [ sec : analysisnoev ] .",
    "section [ sec : cheap - talk - ev ] adds the element of deception detection to the signaling game .",
    "we describe an example of how this detection might be implemented in section [ sec : deception - detection - example ]",
    ". then we analyze the resulting game in section [ sec : analysisev ] . in section [ sec : mechanism - design ]",
    ", we discuss a case study in which a network defender needs to change in order to respond to the advent of honeypot detection .",
    "we review related work in section [ sec : related - work ] , and conclude the paper in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we review the concept of signaling games , a class of two - player , dynamic , incomplete information games .",
    "the information asymmetry and dynamic nature of these games captures the essence of deception , and the notion of separating , pooling , or partially - separating equilibria can be related to truthful , deceptive , or partially - truthful behavior .",
    "our model consists of a signaling game in which the types , messages , and actions are taken from discrete sets with two elements .",
    "call this two - player , incomplete information game @xmath1 . in @xmath1 , a sender , @xmath2 , observes a type @xmath3 drawn with probabilities @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "he then sends a message , @xmath6 to the receiver , @xmath7 . after observing the message ( but not the type )",
    ", @xmath7 plays an action @xmath8 .",
    "the flow of information between sender and receiver is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : block - diagram - signal ] .",
    "let @xmath9 and @xmath10 be the utility obtained by @xmath2 and @xmath7 , respectively , when the type is @xmath0 and the receiver plays action @xmath11 .",
    "notice that the utilities are not directly dependent on the message , @xmath12 ; hence the description of this model as a `` cheap - talk '' game .",
    "block diagram of a signaling game with two discrete types , messages , and actions . ]",
    "the sender s strategy consists of playing a message @xmath12 , after observing a type @xmath0 , with probability @xmath13 .",
    "the receiver s strategy consists of playing an action @xmath11 , after observing a message @xmath12 , with probability @xmath14 .",
    "denote the sets of all such strategies as @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "define expected utilities for the sender and receiver as @xmath17 and @xmath18 , such that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the expected utilities for the sender and receiver , respectively , when the sender and receiver play according to the strategy profile @xmath21 . finally , define @xmath22 and @xmath23 such that @xmath24 gives the expected utility for @xmath2 for playing @xmath25 when @xmath7 plays @xmath26 and the type is @xmath0 , and @xmath27 gives the expected utility for @xmath7 for playing @xmath26 when the type is @xmath0 and she observes message @xmath12 .",
    "we now review the concept of perfect bayesian nash equilibrium , the natural extension of subgame perfection to games of incomplete information .    a perfect bayesian nash equilibrium ( see @xcite ) of signaling game @xmath1 is a strategy profile @xmath21 and posterior beliefs @xmath28 of the receiver about the sender such that    @xmath29    @xmath30    @xmath31    eq . [ eq : pbe1 ] requires @xmath2 to maximize his expected utility for the strategy played by @xmath7 for all types @xmath0 .",
    "the second equation requires that , for all messages @xmath12 , @xmath7 maximizes his expected utility against the strategy played by @xmath2 given his beliefs .",
    "finally , eq . [ eq : def1-beliefup ] requires the beliefs of @xmath7 about the type to be consistent with the strategy played by @xmath2 , using bayes law to update his prior belief according to @xmath2 s strategy .",
    "in this section , we describe an example of deception in cyber security using signaling games .",
    "these type of models have been used , for instance , in @xcite .",
    "we give results here primarily in order to show how the results change after we add the factor of evidence emission in section [ sec : analysisev ] .",
    "consider a game @xmath32 , in which a defender uses honeypots to protect a network of computers .",
    "we consider a model and parameters from @xcite , with some adaptations . in this game ,",
    "the ratio of normal systems to honeypots is considered fixed . based on this ratio",
    ", nature assigns a _ type _ - normal system or honeypot - to each system in the network .",
    "the sender is the network defender , who can choose to reveal the type of each system or disguise the systems .",
    "he can disguise honeypots as normal systems and disguise normal systems as honeypots .",
    "the _ message _ is thus the network defender s portrayal of the system .",
    "the receiver in this game is the attacker , who observes the defender s portrayal of the system but not the actual type of the system .",
    "he forms a _ belief _ about the actual type of the system given the sender s message , and then chooses an _ action : _ attack or withdraw . ] .",
    "table [ tab : parameters - ghoney ] gives the parameters of @xmath32 , and the extensive form of @xmath32 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : extformghoney ] .",
    "we have used the game theory software _ gambit _",
    "@xcite for this illustration , as well as for simulating the results of games later in the paper .    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     for adversary detection capabilities represented by @xmath33 , we have a standard signaling game , and thus the well - known result that a ( pooling ) equilibrium always exists . in @xmath34 ,",
    "the deception detection is fool - proof , and thus the receiver knows the type with certainty .",
    "we are left with a complete information game .",
    "essentially , the type merely determines which stackelberg game the sender and receiver play . because pure strategy equilibria always exist in stackelberg games , @xmath34 also always has pure - strategy equilibria .",
    "the rather unintuitive result comes from @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . in these ranges ,",
    "the receiver s ability to detect deception falls somewhere between no capability ( @xmath33 ) and perfect capability ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "those regions exhibit pure - strategy equilibria , but the intermediate regions may not . specifically , they appear to fail to support pure - strategy equilibria when the ratio of honeypots within the network does not fall close to either @xmath38 or @xmath39 . in section [ sec : mechanism - design ] on mechanism design , we will see that this region plays an important role in the comparison of network defense - and deceptive interactions in general - with and without the technology for detecting deception .",
    "in this section , we discuss design considerations for a defender who is protecting a network of computers using honeypots . in order to do this , we choose a particular case study , and analyze how the network defender can best set parameters to achieve his goals .",
    "we also discuss the scenario from the point of view of the attacker .",
    "specifically , we examine how the defender can set the exogenous properties of the interaction in 1 ) the case in which honeypots can not be detected , and 2 ) the case in which the attacker has implemented a method for detecting honeypots .",
    "then , we discuss the difference between these two situations .",
    "first , consider the case in which the attacker does not have the ability to detect honeypots , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath32 .",
    "the parameters which determine the attacker and defender utilities are set according to table [ tab : sample - parameters - which ] .",
    "the attacker s utility as a function of the fraction of normal systems in the network is given by the red ( circular ) data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : usattacker1 ] .",
    "we can distinguish two parameter regions . when the proportion of honeypots in the network is greater than approximately @xmath40 , ( _ i.e. _ @xmath41 ) , the attacker is completely deterred . because of the high likelihood that he will encounter a honeypot if he attacks , he chooses to withdraw from all systems .",
    "as the proportion of normal systems increases after @xmath42 , he switches to attacking all systems .",
    "he attacks regardless of the sender s signal , because in the pooling equilibrium , his signal does not convey any information about the type to the receiver . in this domain , as the proportion of normal systems increases , the expected utility of the attacker increases .    for this case",
    "in which the attacker can not detect honeypots , the defender s expected utility as a function of @xmath4 is given by the red ( circular ) data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : udefender ] .",
    "we have noted that , in the domain @xmath41 , the attacker always withdraws . in this domain , it is actually beneficial for the defender to have as close as possible to the transition density of @xmath43 normal systems , because he gains more utility from normal systems that are not attacked than from honeypots that are not attacked .",
    "but if the defender increases the proportion of normal systems beyond @xmath43 , he incurs a sudden drop in utility , because the attacker switches form never attacking to always attacking .",
    "thus , the if the defender has the capability to design his network with any number of honeypots , he faces an optimization in which he wants to have as close as possible to @xmath40 of systems be normal .",
    "approaches the transition density .",
    "therefore , the defender should be wary of an `` malicious '' attacker who might decide to incur a small extra utility cost in order to inflict a large utility cost on the defender .",
    "a more complete analysis of this idea could be pursued with multiple types of attackers . ]",
    "expected utility for the defender in games of @xmath32 and @xmath44 as a function of the fraction @xmath4 of normal systems in the network . ]",
    "expected utility for the defender in games of @xmath32 and @xmath44 as a function of the fraction @xmath4 of normal systems in the network . ]",
    "consider now how the network defense is affected if the attacker gains some ability to detect deception .",
    "this game takes the form of @xmath44 .",
    "recall that , in this form , a chance move has been added after the sender s action .",
    "the chance move determines whether the receiver observes evidence that the sender is being deceptive . for fig .",
    "[ fig : usattacker1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : udefender ] , we have set the detection rates at @xmath45 and @xmath46 . these fall within the attacker capability range @xmath47 .",
    "observing evidence does not guarantee deception ; neither does a lack of evidence guarantee truth - revelation .    in the blue ( cross )",
    "data points in fig .",
    "[ fig : usattacker1 ] , we see that , at the extremes of @xmath4 , the utility of the attacker is unaffected by the ability to detect deception according to probabilities @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "the low ranges of @xmath4 , as described in table [ tab : equilibria - for - selected ] , correspond to the _ honeypot - saturated _ region . in this region",
    ", honeypots predominate to such an extent that the attacker is completely deterred from attacking .",
    "note that , compared to the data points for the case without deception detection , the minimum proportion of honeypots which incentives the attacker to uniformly withdraw has increased .",
    "thus , for instance , a @xmath4 of approximately @xmath50 incentivizes an attacker without deception detection capabilities to withdraw from all systems , but does not incentivize an attacker with deception detection capabilities to withdraw . at @xmath51 , the advent of honeypot - detection abilities causes the defender s utility to drop from @xmath52 to approximately @xmath53 . at the other end of the @xmath4 axis , we see that a high - enough @xmath4 causes the utilities to again be unaffected by the ability to detect deception .",
    "this is because the proportion of normal systems is so high that the receiver s best strategy is to attack constantly ( regardless of whether he observes evidence for deception ) .    in the middle ( non - saturated )",
    "_ _ region of @xmath4 , the attacker s strategy is no longer to solely attack or solely withdraw .",
    "this causes the `` cutting the corner '' behavior of the attacker s utility in fig .",
    "[ fig : usattacker1 ] .",
    "this conditional strategy also induces the middle region for the defender s utility in fig .",
    "[ fig : udefender ] .",
    "intuitively , we might expect that the attacker s ability to detect deception could only decrease the defender s utility .",
    "but the middle ( _ non - saturated _ ) range of @xmath4 shows that this is not the case . indeed from approximately @xmath54 to @xmath55 ,",
    "the defender actually benefits from the attacker s ability to detect deception ! the attacker , himself , always benefits from the ability to detect deception .",
    "thus , there is an interesting region of @xmath4 for which the ability of the attacker to detect deception results in a mutual benefit .",
    "finally , we can examine the effect of evidence as it becomes more powerful in the green ( triangle ) points in fig .",
    "[ fig : usattacker1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : udefender ] .",
    "these equilibria were obtained for @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "this more powerful detection capability broadens the middle parameter domain in which the attacker bases his strategy partly upon evidence . indeed , in the omnipotent detector case , the plots for both attacker and defender consist of straight lines from their utilities at @xmath58 to their utilities at @xmath59 .",
    "because the attacker with omnipotent detector is able to discern the type of the system completely , his utility grows in proportion with the proportion of normal systems , which he uniformly attacks .",
    "he withdraws uniformly from honeypots .",
    "deception has become a critical research area , and several works have studied problems similar to ours .",
    "alcan et al .",
    "@xcite discuss how to combine sensing technologies within a network with game theory in order to design intrusion detection systems .",
    "they study two models .",
    "the first is a cooperative game , in which the contribution of different sensors towards detecting an intrusion determines the coalitions of sensors whose threat values will be used in computing the threat level . in the second model , they include the attacker , who determines which subsystems to attack .",
    "this model is a dynamic ( imperfect ) information game , meaning that as moves place the game in various information sets , players learn about the history of moves .",
    "unlike our model , it is a complete information game , meaning that both players know the utility functions of the other player .",
    "farhang et al .",
    "study a multiple - period , information - asymmetric attacker - defender game involving deception @xcite . in their model , the sender type - benign or malicious",
    "- is known only with an initial probability to the receiver , and that probability is updated in a bayesian manner during the course of multiple interactions . in @xcite ,",
    "zhuang et al .",
    "study deception in multiple - period signaling games , but their paper also involves resource - allocation .",
    "the paper has interesting insights into the advantage to a defender of maintaining secrecy .",
    "similar to our work , they consider an example of defensive use of deception . in both @xcite and @xcite , however , players update beliefs only through repeated interactions , whereas one of the players in our model incorporates a mechanism for deception detection .",
    "we have drawn most extensively from the work of carroll and grosu @xcite , who study the strategic use of honeypots for network defense in a signaling game .",
    "the parameters of our attacker and defender utilities come from @xcite , and the basic structure of our signaling game is adapted from that work . in @xcite , the type of a particular system is chosen randomly from the distribution of normal systems and honeypots .",
    "then the sender chooses how to describe the system ( as a normal system or as a honeypot ) , which may be truthful or deceptive . for the receiver s move",
    ", he may choose to attack , to withdraw , or to condition his attack on testing the system .",
    "in this way , honeypot detection is included in the model .",
    "honeypot detection adds a cost to the attacker regardless of whether the system being tested is a normal system or a honeypot , but mitigates the cost of an attack being observed in the case that the system is a honeypot . in our paper , we enrich the representation of honeypot testing by making its effect on utility endogenous .",
    "we model the outcome of this testing as an additional move by nature after the sender s move .",
    "this models detection as technique which may not always succeed , and to which both the sender and receiver can adapt their equilibrium strategies .",
    "in this paper , we have investigated the ways in which the outcomes of a strategic , deceptive interaction are affected by the advent of deception - detecting technology .",
    "we have studied this problem using a version of a signaling game in which deception may be detected with some probability .",
    "we have modeled the detection of deception as a chance move that occurs after the sender selects a message based on the type that he observes . for the cases in",
    "which evidence is trivial or omnipotent , we have given the analytical equilibrium outcome , and for cases in which evidence has partial power , we have presented numerical results . throughout the paper , we have used the example of honeypot implementation in network defense . in this context , the technology of detecting honeypots has played the role of a malicious use of anti - deception .",
    "this has served as a general example to show how equilibrium utilities and strategies can change in games involving deception when the agent being deceived gains some detection ability .    our first contribution is the model we have presented for signaling games with deception detection .",
    "we also show how special cases of this model cause the game to degenerate into a traditional signaling game or into a complete information game .",
    "our model is quite general , and could easily be applied to strategic interactions in interpersonal deception such as border control , international negotiation , advertising and sales , and suspect interviewing .",
    "our second contribution is the numerical demonstration showing that pure - strategy equilibria are not supported under this model when the distribution of types is in a middle range but are supported when the distribution is close to either extreme .",
    "finally , we show that it is possible that the ability of a receiver to detect deception could actually increase the utility of a possibly - deceptive sender .",
    "these results have concrete implications for network defense through honeypot deployment .",
    "more importantly , they are also general enough to apply to the large and critical body of strategic interactions that involve deception .",
