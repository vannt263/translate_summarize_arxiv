    "the study of angular distributions in processes of three - particle fragmentation is an important source of information about the dynamics of many physical objects such as atoms and molecules .    till recently , the experimental technique allowed one to analyze the angular distributions only for charged particles resulting from the many - body fragmentation . in such situations ,",
    "the structure of the angular distributions is determined by the coulomb force .",
    "for example , this is realized in the process of two - electron single - photon ionization of helium atom which is quite well studied both experimentally and theoretically @xcite .    during the last decade ,",
    "the progress of experimental technique has made it possible to investigate the angular distributions of neutral fragments arising in the processes of three - atomic molecular break - up .",
    "namely , in @xcite the dissociative recombination of water ion into the neutral atomic fragments has been studied . in a series of experiments @xcite the angular distributions in the predissociation of the triatomic hydrogen into three hydrogen atoms were investigated .",
    "clearly , the analysis of angular distributions in molecular break - up processes could gain significant insight into the nature of chemical forces .    in molecular physics the dynamics of the interacting atoms",
    "is usually described within the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation . in this approach the interaction of ions is represented by the set of potential energy surfaces ( pes ) which are , in fact , the mean field of the electrons .",
    "it is important that , generally , pes can not be decomposed into a sum of binary potentials ( i.e. pairwise interactions ) .",
    "rather , it will contain the terms which `` entangle '' the coordinates of all particles thus making the standard methods ( such as faddeev approach @xcite ) inapplicable .",
    "thus , the development of an adequate theory of many - particle molecular fragmentation is a complicated task .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to have simple yet physically meaningful models of the molecular break - up .    in the break - up into the neutral fragments often the situation is realized when the kinetic energy of fragments prevails over their interaction potential .",
    "this opens the possibility to apply the perturbation theory to the calculation of the wave function of three - particle continuum . in the presented paper",
    "the lowest - order perturbation theory with respect to the potential energy was applied to the quantum three - body system . even in this simplest case",
    "the calculation of the matrix elements leads to twelve - dimensional integrals .",
    "however , it turns out that the dimensionality of these integrals can be reduced from twelve to six by employing the technique of collective multipole expansions .",
    "this technique was used in @xcite where such an expansion was derived for the product of two three - dimensional plane waves @xmath2 . note that the results presented in the paper allows one to simplify the calculation of the matrix elements within the perturbative approximation even if the potential contains three - body ( i.g",
    ". non - binary ) terms .",
