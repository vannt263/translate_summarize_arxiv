    "the quantum mechanics on conical spaces has attracted much attention not only in early investigations @xcite but also in recent papers @xcite . among different motivations for the study of a quantum particle on a cone we only recall the context of the @xmath0 dimensional quantum gravity @xcite , cosmic strings @xcite and defects in various media @xcite . nevertheless , to our best knowledge , all investigations of quantum mechanics on a cone were restricted to the case of the cone with a single nappe or equivalently the plane with a deficit angle and the situation of a double cone , i.e.  two cones placed apex to apex , has not yet been pursued .",
    "this is all the more surprising since the case of a double cone is much more simple . in particular , in contrast to the situation with a single nappe , we have no troublesome questions like that concerning behavior of a free particle moving in a generator towards a cone tip after reaching it , and there is no need to analyze self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators representing observables of the system . in this work",
    "we perform a detailed analysis of the classical and quantum mechanics on a double cone involving the case of a free particle and harmonic oscillator on the cone .",
    "an interesting feature of the dynamics on the double cone discussed in this paper is the instability of the classical rectilinear motion on the meridian in the sense of lyapunov and its implications on the quantum level .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we study the dynamics of the free classical particle on the cone .",
    "section iii is devoted to the quantum mechanics on the cone in the case of the free motion .",
    "the classical harmonic oscillator on the cone is discussed in sec .",
    "iv . in sec .",
    "v we investigate the quantization of the harmonic oscillator on the cone .",
    "let us consider a particle confined to a surface of a circular double cone given by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the coordinate of a particle on a meridian ( generator ) , @xmath3 is the opening angle of the cone , so @xmath4 , and @xmath5 specifies the position of a particle on a parallel .",
    "in view of ( 2.1 ) the equation of the conical surface is of the form @xmath6 the lagrangian of the free particle with mass @xmath7 constrained to the conical surface ( 2.2 ) is @xmath8 the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the momentum referring to the motion in the meridian and @xmath11 is the angular momentum .",
    "therefore , the hamilton s equations are @xmath12    now let @xmath13 designates the conserved angular momentum .",
    "for @xmath14 we find from ( 2.5 ) @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 therefore @xmath14 refers to the rectilinear uniform motion along a meridian .",
    "consider now the case @xmath18 .",
    "taking into account the following expression on the energy @xmath19 we find @xmath20 where +",
    "( @xmath21 ) sign refers to the motion on the upper ( lower ) nappe of the cone and @xmath22 is an integration constant which can be fixed with the help of the initial data .",
    "thus , it turns out that for @xmath18 the particle resides definitely on the upper or lower nappe and there is no communication between these two regions of the configuration space .",
    "this means , among others , that the solution to ( 2.5 ) with @xmath23 referring to rectilinear motion across the tip of the cone is unstable in the lyapunov sense .",
    "indeed , an arbitrary small perturbation of the initial condition @xmath14 leads to large deviations of corresponding solutions .",
    "such instability is illustrated in fig .",
    "1 ( bottom - right figure ) . on the other hand , an immediate consequence of ( 2.8 ) is the following inequality : latexmath:[\\[%<2.9 >    @xmath18 the geodesics have the lower ( upper ) bound on the upper ( lower ) nappe .",
    "we remark that the limit @xmath25 for ( 2.8 ) is @xmath26 where we confined for brevity to the case of the motion on the upper nape .",
    "clearly this asymptotics does not correspond to any real motion . if so it would violate the uniqueness of the initial conditions problem ( cauchy problem ) related to the system ( 2.5 ) .",
    "an example of the free motion on the cone ( geodesic ) given by ( 2.1 ) and ( 2.5 ) is presented in fig 1 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     furthermore , using the second equation of ( 4.2 ) we get for @xmath18 @xmath27 as with the case of the free motion we obtain in the limit @xmath25 @xmath28 finally , using the first equation of ( 4.2 ) we derive the following formula on the momentum @xmath29 we point out that @xmath30 is zero when the extremal values of @xmath31 are reached given by ( 4.6 ) . in the limit @xmath25",
    "this expression takes the form @xmath32",
    "consider now a quantum particle moving on a double cone and bound to its tip by the harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian is @xmath33 consider the eigenvalue equation for the hamiltonian @xmath34 on separating variables and setting @xmath35 we can write ( 5.2 ) in the form @xmath36 we remark that the potential occuring in the schrdinger equation ( 5.4 ) which is a sum of the harmonic oscillator and inverse square potential is referred to as the smorodinsky - winternitz potential @xcite , isotonic oscillator potential @xcite or harmonic oscillator with `` centripetal barrier '' @xcite .",
    "this potential is also closely related to the well - known morse potential @xcite .",
    "however , as far as we are aware , the schrdinger equation ( 5.4 ) was not discussed in the literature in the context of the double cone .",
    "the quantum harmonic oscillator in the case of a cone with a single nappe or equivalently the plane with a deficit angle was studied in @xcite and @xcite . as mentioned earlier",
    "this case is much more complicated than that investigated herein dealing with quantum mechanics on a double cone , because one is forced to analyse self - adjoint extensions of symmetric operators representing physical observables @xcite .",
    "now , making the ansatz @xmath37 where @xmath22 is the normalization constant , we find that whenever the parameter @xmath38 satisfies @xmath39 which leads to @xmath40 then @xmath41 fulfils the kummer equation @xmath42 a numerically satisfactory solution to ( 5.8 ) with a good behavior at infinity is given by the kummer function @xcite @xmath43 another notation for the kummer function @xmath44 is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "now , @xmath46 is a polynomial when @xmath47 , where @xmath48 , and @xmath49 for @xmath50 . demanding decreasing of @xmath51 as @xmath52 this leads to the quantization condition on energy @xmath53 furthermore , the requirements @xmath54 and convergence of the norm of the solution to ( 5.8 ) rule out the minus sign in ( 5.7 ) , so @xmath55 and @xmath56 using the identity @xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 are the generalized laguerre polynomials , we get @xmath59",
    "hence , we finally obtain the desired normalized ( in the sense of @xmath60 ) solution @xmath61 to ( 5.4 ) such that @xmath62 and the normalized solution to the schrdinger equation on the cone ( 5.2 ) of the form @xmath63 where the normalization is given by @xmath64 up to the phase factor and normalization constant the solution ( 5.15 ) coincides with the solution to ( 5.4 ) introduced by hakobyan _",
    "et al _ in reference 12 .",
    "however , the parameter @xmath65 labeling the solution obtained in @xcite had no physical interpretation .",
    "on the other hand , it follows immediately from ( 5.15 ) that if @xmath66 , then this parameter can be related to the angular momentum @xmath67 on the cone via @xmath68 .",
    "now , an immediate consequence of ( 5.3 ) and ( 5.4 ) is the following normalized solution to the eigenvalue equation ( 5.2 ) for @xmath69 : @xmath70 referring to the energy @xmath71 where @xmath72 are hermite polynomials . indeed , ( 5.4 ) for @xmath69 is the schrdinger equation for the standard harmonic oscillator on the line .",
    "analogously as with the free motion , the solution ( 5.18 ) corresponding to @xmath69 is different from the limit @xmath73 of the solution ( 5.16 ) .",
    "in fact , taking into account the identity @xcite @xmath74 we obtain the limit @xmath73 of @xmath75 given by ( 5.16 ) such that @xmath76 the energy spectrum in the limit @xmath73 is @xmath77 we have thus obtained in the limit @xmath73 only a part of the solution corresponding to the case of the harmonic oscillator on a meridian ( generator ) related to the odd hermite polynomials . as in the case of the free motion this observation is consistent with instablility of the solution ( 4.3 ) of classical equations of motion describing harmonic oscillations around a point @xmath78 in the meridian .",
    "in this work we study the classical and quantum particle on the double cone in the case of the free motion and harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "an interesting pecularity of the dynamics on the cone is the instability of the free motion in the generator on both classical and quantum level .",
    "this observation seems to be of importance for better understanding of quantum dynamics .",
    "indeed , as with deterministic chaos the role of instabilities in quantum dynamics is far from clear . referring to chaotic motion it is also worthwhile to point out that the unstable solution describing harmonic oscillations around a tip of the cone is rather exotic example of the unstable and bounded solution of a nonlinear dynamical system which does not show chaotic behavior .",
    "furthermore , a remarkable property of the dynamics on the double cone investigated in this paper is the role played by the vertex which acts as a filter selecting from all possible motions the rectilinear one in the generator .",
    "finally , we remark that the results of this paper provide a physical interpretation as a harmonic oscillator on the double cone for the one - dimensional smorodinsky - winternitz potential which can be connected with the morse potential .",
