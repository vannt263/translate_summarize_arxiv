    "the reason being that their polynomial @xmath59 in general does not take the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 and the complex numbers @xmath62 defined by them on page 624 , line 10 , by @xmath63_{\\theta = 0 } = \\sum\\limits_{k = 0}^n { l_k a_k } \\ ] ] along with the equation ( 24 ) of @xcite .",
