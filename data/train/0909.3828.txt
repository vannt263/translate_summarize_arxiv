    "@xmath106 for the best - fit model is 7.5 ( the blue lines in figure 7 ) , but different combinations of external a@xmath100 and s@xmath101 can provide similar fits , for example , the model with s@xmath101 = 4 and the external a@xmath100 = 0.5 ( red lines in figure 7 ) and the model with s@xmath101 = 6 and the external a@xmath100 = 1.5 ( green lines in figure 7 ) have @xmath106 about 15 . the external a@xmath100 can be further constrained by line modeling of co(2 - 1 ) emission since photoelectric ( pe ) heating is sensitive to the surrounding extinction , as detailed in  4.2 .    for the density distribution of rno91 , we use the gravitational collapse model presented by shu ( 1977 ) .",
    "in this picture , the model begins from an idealized singular isothermal sphere with an envelope with @xmath119 .",
    "collapse begins inside the sphere , and a wave of infall propagates outward at the speed of sound as time progresses .",
    "the density inside the infall radius ( ) approximates @xmath120 as material falls into the center .",
    "for rno91 at @xmath121 , @xmath122 .",
    "the best - fit model adopting this scenario is shown in figure 7 , with an internal heating source of 0.4 and of 0.006 pc .",
    "deep inside the cloud , the gas temperature is equal to the dust temperature because high densities produce rapid collisions between dust and gas .",
    "however , at lower densities , since dust and gas are decoupled , the gas temperature must be determined by balancing heating and cooling rates .",
    "we use a gas - dust energetics code by s. doty including gas - dust energy transfer , cosmic ray heating , pe heating , and molecular cooling ( details are given in doty & neufeld [ 1997 ] and the appendix in young et al . [ 2004 ] ) .",
    "co is the major coolant in clouds , and in principle we should include co depletion in the modeling loop since it could raise @xmath123 in the cold , dense inner region .",
    "goldsmith ( 2001 ) , doty & neufeld ( 1997 ) , and lee ( 2004 ) found that the effect is relatively small because of efficient gas - dust coupling at the high densities where co is significantly depleted ; therefore , we did not include depletion and desorption in our gas energetics calculation .",
    "the calculated @xmath96 is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the gas temperature decreases in less dense regions where gas - dust collisions are not as efficient , but rises at the outer edge because of pe heating . in the gas energetics code ,",
    "the strength of the uv field relative to the local isrf on the outside of the core is parameterized as g@xmath124 .",
    "we use the equation g@xmath124 = exp(@xmath125a@xmath100 ) , where the attenuation of the isrf corresponds to a certain external a@xmath100 . in dust models ,",
    "different combinations of external a@xmath100 and s@xmath101 can provide similar fits .",
    "for example , figure 7c shows that models with a@xmath100 = 0.4 with s@xmath101 = 4 , a@xmath100 = 1 with s@xmath101 = 5 , and a@xmath100 = 1.5 with s@xmath101 = 6 result in similar modeled fluxes at 160 .",
    "however , the calculated gas temperature profile is more sensitive to the external a@xmath100 since the attenuation of the isrf predominately affects the short wavelengths which are important to the pe heating rate . to examine the model temperature at the outer layer and constrain the amount of surrounding extinction , we modeled the co(2 - 1 ) line toward l43e and compare with the observations ( figure 9 ) , and derive the best - fit g@xmath124 of 0.165 ( corresponds to an external a@xmath100 of 1 ) . also , the cooling rate depends on the linewidth of co , and we use a microturbulent width of 0.24 determined by the c@xmath2o line fitting .",
    "a more detailed treatment of the line modeling is described in  4.4 .",
    "we use the evolutionary chemical model presented by lee et al .",
    "a sequence of be spheres with increasing central densities and an inside - out collapse initiated at the point of a singular isothermal sphere are combined to describe the dynamics , and the model calculates gas and dust temperatures and follows chemical evolution self - consistently at each time step .",
    "the collapse model is adopted from young & evans ( 2005 ) for the evolution of luminosity and density distribution . for rno91",
    ", we use the physical parameters that best match the dust modeling results in  4.1 , and @xmath126 of 0.006 pc corresponds to the timestep of 25000 yr . for l43e ,",
    "since there is no good constraint for the timescales and dynamics of the ppc stage , we simply assume 8 steps of different central densities and test different timescales for each step to optimize the fitting at @xmath118 .",
    "in the chemical models , we assume bare sio@xmath1 for dust grain surfaces to which molecules freeze @xcite .      with the best - fit density profile from dust models , the gas temperature profiles from the gas - energetics calculation , and molecular abundances ( @xmath97 ) from chemical models , the molecular excitation was modeled with a monte carlo radiative transfer code ( mc ) which runs with 40 shells calculating the level populations .",
    "we then simulate the observations with a virtual telescope program ( vt ) ( choi et al .",
    "1995 ) at the observed offset position .",
    "we use the v@xmath30 derived from observations for the modeled line velocity in each source . to fit the observed lines , we also use simple abundance profiles , such as constant and step function , to compare with the results from chemical models .",
    "the goodness of a fit is determined by eye .",
    "we use collision rates by flower & launay ( 1985 ) for co , by green ( 1991 ) for h@xmath1co , by flower ( 1999 ) for hco@xmath0 , and daniel et al .",
    "( 2005 ) for n@xmath1h@xmath0 .",
    "for the deuterated species dco@xmath0 , we use the de - excitation rate coefficients of hco@xmath0 , and the excitation rate coefficients are obtained by detailed balance . in some cases , rates are linearly extrapolated to lower temperatures . for n@xmath1h@xmath0 and c@xmath34o , the components of the hyperfine structures are partially resolved .",
    "components separated by less than the 1/e width of the velocity dispersion were aggregated into a single component .",
    "the aggregated components are modeled independently with relative intensity - weighted abundances and added together to make combined line profiles .",
    "the line modeling results are presented with the observations in figure 3 .",
    "the abundance profiles from chemical models are presented in figure 10 .",
    "some of our line models show self - absorption features , which are not seen in the observed line profiles , especially in hco@xmath0 , h@xmath1co , and n@xmath1h@xmath0 .",
    "an explanation for the lack of self - absorption in molecular lines is clumpy cloud structure with the existence of macroturbulent motions , which is simulated with the monte carlo methods for 3-dimensional clouds by juvela ( 1997 ) .",
    "the line profiles can be confused with heavy self - absorption as well as rotation ( e.g. pavlyuchenkov et al .",
    "since we are not including a complete 3-dimensional calculation in this paper , we only fit the line strength at half maximum level for lines that are self - absorbed in the models .    from observations toward star forming cores , one of the features that potentially indicates the evolutionary status is an anti - correlation of co and n@xmath1h@xmath0 .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath0 is thought to be a good tracer of dense core gas at earlier evolutionary stages until @xmath127 reaches the temperature for co evaporation .",
    "the relative depletion and desorption of n@xmath1 and co are the key processes governing the abundance of n@xmath1h@xmath0 ; however , recent laboratory result shows there is no significant difference of n@xmath1 and co binding energies ( berg et al .",
    "2005 ; bisschop et al . 2006 ) . with an updated higher value of n@xmath1 binding energies ,",
    "the modeled n@xmath1h@xmath0 lines are much weaker than the observed lines .",
    "the timescale for the ppc stage is also a key issue for the freezeout of molecules , so we varied the timescales at different central densities .",
    "a longer total timescale allows more n@xmath1 to form , but a longer time at higher densities ( @xmath128 ) would result in more depletion .",
    "n@xmath1h@xmath0 abundances are directly affected by the amount of n@xmath1 formation and co depletion . to fit the observed n@xmath1h@xmath0 lines , we assume a longer total timescale that allows more n@xmath1 formation and co depletion and shorter time at later stages to prevent n@xmath1 depletion .",
    "two test models are listed in table 4 .",
    "we use the timescales in lee et al .",
    "( 2004 ) as the standard model ( model 1 ) , and to optimize the n@xmath1h@xmath0 abundances for l43e , a longer total timescale of @xmath129 yr is assumed ( model 2 ) . in figure 10 ,",
    "the solid lines are abundance profiles from model 1 , and the dashed lines are from model 2 . for both models , we also tested the n@xmath1h@xmath0 dissociative recombination rates in geppert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) to compare with the rates in the umist database for astrochemistry 1999 @xcite . the rates in geppert et al .",
    "( 2004 ) fit the observations better , and are included in our chemical network for the models presented in this paper .",
    "the co lines are difficult to fit in detail since they are very optically thick and confused by the wing components .",
    "the line profile toward rno91 has wide outflow wings , and the line profile toward l43e also shows a blue wing which possibly comes from another component in the foreground along the line of sight .",
    "the modeled co abundances can still be tested through line fitting of co isotopologues .",
    "we assume the abundance profiles for the co isotopologues have the same form as co with an isotope ratio of o/@xmath2o @xmath130 ( wilson & rood 1994 ) and @xmath2o/@xmath34o @xmath131 @xcite . in model 2 , the modeled c@xmath2o and c@xmath34o line intensities",
    "are efficiently decreased to fit the data since more co depletion is produced .",
    "we also assume an ortho to para ratio of 1.5 ( dickens & irvine 1999 ) to model the ortho - h@xmath1co ( @xmath132 ) lines . for l43e , the h@xmath1co abundance in model 2 is higher than in model 1 by a factor of 2 , but it is possible that self - absorption has greatly weakened the blue peak .    for the hco@xmath0 lines toward l43e ,",
    "although the observed line profile might be obscured by absorption from a foreground component , the modeled line is still too strong .",
    "the cosmic ray ionization rates could affect the results , but neither enhanced nor lowered reaction rates improved the fit of both hco@xmath0 and n@xmath1h@xmath0 data in both cores simultaneously .",
    "we tested empirical abundance profiles with lower abundance at large radii .",
    "for example , if g@xmath124 is higher than we adopted , the higher dissociative recombination rate can lower the abundance in the outer region",
    ". however , we did not find an improved fit even with extremely low hco@xmath0 abundances in the outer region . to match the line intensity",
    "according to the red peak , we use a constant abundance @xmath64(hco@xmath0 ) = @xmath133 , which is lower than the chemical model prediction by a factor of @xmath87.5 . for the deuterated species , since they are favored in a cold region with co depletion , both dco@xmath0 and n@xmath1d@xmath0 are enhanced relative to hco@xmath0 and n@xmath1h@xmath0 at high densities .",
    "the dco@xmath0 abundances in l43e are increased from model 1 to model 2 because of the amount of co depletion , but the modeled dco@xmath0 lines from chemical models are still weaker than observed .",
    "the dco@xmath0 line emission generated primarily in the center region with high densities where hco@xmath0 can be depleted .",
    "it is possible that there is still more co depletion than the chemical models predict .",
    "a dco@xmath0 abundance increased by a factor of @xmath88 is needed to fit the observed line intensity for l43e , and for rno91 , we use a step function with depletion factor of 5 within 0.003 pc .",
    "the best - fit empirical abundance profiles are shown in figure 10 with blue dotted lines for l43e and red dotted lines for rno91 . to compare with the results in  3.3.3 , we also calculated the optical depths for the best - fit hco@xmath0 lines with empirical abundances .",
    "the optical depth of the simulated hco@xmath0(3 - 2 ) line in rno91 is 23 , which is much higher than the value of 3 in l43e .",
    "this result also supports the analysis in  3.3.3 that the @xmath40(dco@xmath0)/@xmath40(hco@xmath0 ) factors calculated with optically thin approximation provide a lower limit , with @xmath40(dco@xmath0)/@xmath40(hco@xmath0 ) at least 4.8 times more enhanced in l43e than in rno91 .    to summarize ,",
    "most of the lines in both sources can be fitted reasonably well with model 2 , which has a longer timescale for the ppc stage .",
    "however , the change of parameters in our different chemical models may only be compensating the effects not yet included .",
    "for example , the grain properties should also be time - dependent .",
    "grain mantles covered by water - rich ice have strong binding energies for molecules to freeze on , but n@xmath1 forms slowly and is less affected . as the density increases and co freezes out , the grain mantle surfaces can be contaminated by co ice .",
    "once grain mantles are co - dominant , the binding energies are lower , which results in less depletion of n@xmath1 and n@xmath1h@xmath0 compared with hco@xmath0 , since hco@xmath0 depletion follows co depletion .",
    "our modeling results of longer timescales at low densities may work equivalently to the effects of higher grain surface binding energies ( water - dominant ) at lower densities .",
    "the difference between our modeling results and observations may be more specifically explained in a model including time - dependent grain properties .",
    "heavy co ( and thus hco@xmath0 ) depletion on the initial water - dominant grain surfaces can result in more abundant dco@xmath0 . with time",
    ", grain surfaces are covered with co ( which produces co@xmath1 on surface ) , resulting in less depletion of n@xmath1 and more abundant n@xmath1h@xmath0 .",
    "we have presented spitzer observations and molecular line observations from the cso toward the two sources rno91 and l43e evolving in the same region .",
    "a self - consistent modeling procedure is employed to investigate the physical condition in each source , and to compare the chemistry in an evolutionary picture .",
    "our results are as follows .    from the spitzer images",
    ", rno91 can be categorized as class i , and l43e is still starless with no embedded source detected .",
    "co depletion is seen in both sources , but the degree of depletion is higher in l43e .",
    "also , strong dco@xmath0 enhancement is seen in l43e .",
    "dust modeling results showed that l43e can be fitted by a be sphere with central density of @xmath134 , and rno91 is characterized to have @xmath126 of 0.006 pc with an inside - out collapse model ( shu 1977 ) .",
    "for the line modeling , the best - fitting chemical model suggests a longer total timescale at earlier stages but fast evolution at higher densities for the ppc stage .",
    "the observed abundances of n@xmath1h@xmath0 and co isotopologues can be matched well in both sources , but in l43e , the modeled hco@xmath0 abundance is too high by a factor of 7.5 , and the modeled dco@xmath0 abundance is too low by a factor of 8 .",
    "it is possible there is still more co depletion in the center than the model predicted . in this picture , rno91 is possibly the first star forming in this region , and l43e could be spending a longer time at the ppc phase .",
