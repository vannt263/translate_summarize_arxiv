    "the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) factorization formalism@xcite provides a systematic framework for analyzing annihilation decay rates and inclusive production rates of heavy quarkonium .",
    "these rates are factored into short - distance coefficients and long - distance nrqcd matrix elements .",
    "the short - distance coefficients can be calculated using perturbative qcd as a power series in the strong coupling constant @xmath2 at the scale of the heavy quark mass .",
    "the matrix elements scale in a definite way with @xmath3 , the typical relative velocity of the heavy quark .",
    "the nrqcd factorization formalism therefore organizes the decay rate or production rate into a double expansion in powers of @xmath4 and @xmath3 .",
    "the _ threshold expansion method_@xcite is a general method for calculating the short - distance coefficients which fully exploits the nrqcd factorization formalism . in this method ,",
    "a quantity that is closely related to the creation or annihilation rate of a @xmath5 pair near threshold is calculated using perturbation theory in full qcd and then expanded in powers of the relative 3-momentum @xmath6 of the @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "matrix elements of 4-fermion operators in nrqcd are also calculated using perturbation theory and expanded around the threshold @xmath9 .",
    "the short - distance coefficients in the factorization formula are then determined by matching these expansions in @xmath10 order by order in @xmath4 . finally , the nrqcd matrix elements for specific quarkonium states are simplified by using rotational symmetry , heavy - quark spin symmetry , and the vacuum - saturation approximation .    in calculating",
    "the short - distance coefficients beyond leading order in @xmath4 , ultraviolet divergences and infrared divergences inevitably arise and need to be regularized . in perturbative calculations ,",
    "the most convenient method for regularizing both ultraviolet and infrared divergences is dimensional regularization .",
    "we recently generalized the threshold expansion method to @xmath11 spatial dimensions , so that dimensional regularization can be used consistently in quarkonium calculations @xcite .",
    "the qcd side of the matching condition and the matrix elements on the nrqcd side are calculated in @xmath11 dimensions using perturbation theory and then matched to obtain the short - distance coefficients .",
    "after renormalization of coupling constants in qcd and nrqcd , the short - distance coefficients may have poles in @xmath12 , which must be removed by renormalization of the 4-fermion operators in nrqcd .",
    "one must take care to avoid simplifying the matrix elements of these operators using identities that are specific to 3 dimensions until after these renormalizations have been carried out .",
    "we illustrated our method by calculating gluon fragmentation functions to s - wave and p - wave charmonium states , resolving a discrepancy between two previous calculations of the fragmentation function for @xmath13 .",
    "there are also discrepancies in the literature between various calculations of the annihilation decay rates for p - wave states . in the original calculations by barbieri et al .",
    "@xcite , either the binding energy of the @xmath5 pair or the energy resolution of a gluon jet was used as the infrared cutoff . in recent calculations by huang and chao @xcite and by petrelli @xcite , dimensional regularization was used for the infrared cutoff .",
    "the discrepancies between their results and those of barbieri et al .",
    "appear in the terms proportional to @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the number of light quark flavors .",
    "this is the term that is sensitive to the infrared cutoff . in this paper",
    ", we use the threshold expansion method in conjunction with dimensional regularization to calculate the term proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "we find that the discrepancy between the results of barbieri et al .",
    "and the recent calculations using dimensional regularization is due simply to different definitions of a color - octet nrqcd matrix element .",
