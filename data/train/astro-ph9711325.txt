    "the determination of the equation of state of neutron stars has been an important goal of nuclear physics for more than two decades .",
    "progress toward this goal can be made by establishing astrophysical constraints as well as by improving our understanding of nuclear forces .",
    "many ways of deriving constraints from astrophysics have been explored .",
    "one of the best known is pulse timing of pulsars in binary systems . although binary pulsar timing has made possible stringent tests of general relativity ( see , e.g. , taylor 1992 ) , the @xmath3 masses derived from timing ( see thorsett et al .",
    "1993 ) are allowed by all equations of state based on realistic nuclear physics , and hence these observations have not eliminated any of the equations of state currently being considered .",
    "the highest known neutron star spin frequency , the 643  hz frequency of , is also allowed by all equations of state currently under consideration .",
    "radius estimates based on the energy spectra of type  1 x - ray bursts and on observations of thermal emission from the surfaces of neutron stars are more restrictive in principle but currently have large systematic uncertainties ( see lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ; gelman 1995 ) .",
    "the discovery of high - frequency brightness oscillations from sixteen neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries with the _ rossi _ x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) holds great promise for providing important new constraints .",
    "oscillations are observed both in the persistent x - ray emission and during type  1 x - ray bursts .",
    "the kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed in the persistent emission have high amplitudes and relatively high coherences ( see van der klis 1997 ) .",
    "a pair of kilohertz qpos is commonly observed from a given source .",
    "although the frequencies of these qpos vary by up to a factor of @xmath42 , the frequency separation @xmath5 between a pair of kilohertz qpos appears to be constant in almost all cases . in both the sonic - point ( miller , lamb , & psaltis 1996 ) and magnetospheric ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ) beat - frequency interpretations , the higher frequency in a pair is the orbital frequency at the inner edge of the keplerian flow , whereas the lower frequency is the beat of the stellar spin frequency with this frequency .",
    "such high orbital frequencies yield interesting bounds on the masses and radii of these neutron stars and interesting constraints on the equation of state of neutron star matter ( miller et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the brightness oscillations observed during type  1 x - ray bursts are different in character from the qpos observed in the persistent emission . only a single oscillation has been observed from each source during a type  1 x - ray burst , and the oscillations in the tails of bursts appear to be highly coherent ( see , e.g. , smith , morgan , & bradt 1997 ) , with frequencies that are always the same for a given source ( comparison of burst oscillations from over about a year shows that the timescale for any variation in the oscillation frequency is @xmath6  yr ; strohmayer 1997 ) . the burst oscillations in ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 ; strohmayer 1997 ) and ( swank 1997 ) have frequencies that are consistent with the separation frequencies of their kilohertz qpo pairs . the burst oscillations in ( zhang et al .",
    "1996 ) and ( smith et al .  1997 ; wijnands & van der klis 1997 ) , have frequencies that are consistent with twice the separation frequencies of their kilohertz qpo pairs .",
    "the burst oscillations are thought to be caused by emission from one or two nearly identical emitting poles , producing oscillations at the stellar spin frequency or its first overtone , respectively .",
    "if so , the anisotropy observed at infinity of the radiation emitted from the surface , and hence the amplitude of the burst oscillations , typically decreases with increasing gravitational light deflection .",
    "the burst oscillations can therefore be used to constrain the compactness of neutron stars and the equation of state of neutron star matter ( strohmayer 1997 ) .    in this letter we present the results of general relativistic calculations to determine the maximum relative amplitudes of burst oscillations , as a function of stellar compactness , following the procedure described by pechenick , ftaclas , & cohen ( 1983 ; see also chen & shaham 1989 ) .",
    "we go beyond these previous treatments by using a more realistic angular intensity distribution at the stellar surface , by including the angle dependence of the energy spectrum , by considering the effects of x - ray color oscillations , and by computing the amplitudes at overtones .",
    "we show that gravitational light deflection typically reduces the relative amplitude of the oscillations produced by two poles compared to one pole and that effects other than doppler shifts and aberration are second - order in the rotation rate .",
    "we describe our assumptions and method in   2 . in",
    "  3 we present our results and discuss the observational signatures that allow the derivation of robust limits on the compactness of the burst sources .",
    "the main purpose of our calculations is to derive constraints on the compactness of the neutron stars that display oscillations during type  1 x - ray bursts . to do this",
    ", we must determine the largest possible amplitude of an oscillation for a given compactness .",
    "we therefore make the following assumptions , which maximize the oscillation amplitude ( these are discussed further in   3 ) :    ( 1 )  the radiation that we see comes directly from the stellar surface .",
    "( 2 )  the star radiates from one or two emitting poles ; the rest of the surface is dark .",
    "( 3 )  the pole or poles are pointlike and located in the rotational equator .",
    "( 4 )  if there are two poles , they are identical and antipodal .",
    "( 5 )  the observer s line of sight is in the rotational equator .",
    "the effects on the spacetime of the star s rotation change the oscillation amplitude only to second order ( see lamb & miller 1995 and miller & lamb 1996 for details ) , and are much smaller than first- and second - order doppler effects for the relatively slow rotation rates of interest .",
    "we therefore neglect them , performing all calculations in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we compute the intensity seen by an observer when an emitting pole is at a given rotational phase using the procedure discussed by pechenick et al .",
    "suppose that the emitting pole is at azimuthal angle @xmath7 and that the azimuthal angle of the photon when it reaches infinity is @xmath8 .",
    "the angle @xmath8 is a maximum when the photon is emitted tangentially to the stellar surface , and is then ( pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , eq .",
    "[ 2.13 ] ) @xmath9^{-1/2}\\,du\\ ; .\\ ] ] here and below we use geometrized units in which @xmath10 .",
    "suppose that the observer is at infinity at azimuthal angle @xmath11 .",
    "if @xmath12 the observer can not see the pole . if @xmath13 we solve for @xmath14 , the reciprocal of the impact parameter to the pole , using ( pechenick et al .",
    "1983 , eq .",
    "[ 2.12 ] ) : @xmath15^{-1/2}\\,du\\ ; .\\ ] ] in the schwarzschild spacetime , the angle @xmath16 to the normal at the stellar surface of the light ray that has impact parameter @xmath17 at infinity is given implicitly by @xmath18 , where the maximum impact parameter is @xmath19 ( see , e.g. , abramowicz , ellis , & lanza 1990 ; miller & lamb 1996 ) .",
    "the flux measured by the observer is proportional to @xmath20\\cos\\psi ( \\phi_{\\rm obs})$ ] , where @xmath21 is the specific intensity at photon frequency @xmath22 and angle @xmath16 from the normal to the pole . as usual , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are constant , where @xmath25 is the frequency - integrated specific intensity .",
    "hence , changes in @xmath26 and @xmath25 caused by doppler shifts and redshifts are easily computed by calculating the change in the frequency of the photons .",
    "if the star were not rotating and the emission from the pole were isotropic , then @xmath27 would be constant .",
    "however , because the star is rotating , the intensity distribution is aberrated and the photon frequency is doppler - shifted by the factor @xmath28 $ ] , where @xmath29 is the velocity at the stellar equator and @xmath30 . also , the specific intensity is not expected to be isotropic even in the rest frame of the stellar surface , because radiation that diffuses outward through an optically thick scattering atmosphere emerges with a specific intensity distribution @xmath31 that is nearly three times as bright along the normal as in directions tangential to the surface ( see chandrasekhar 1960 , chapter 3 ) .",
    "moreover , the energy spectrum will also , in general , depend on the angle from the normal .",
    "the angle dependence of the actual spectrum is likely to be complicated ( see , e.g. , lewin , van paradijs , & taam 1993 ) .",
    "however , the qualitative effects of angle dependence are illustrated by a simplified emission model in which the spectrum emerging at angle @xmath16 is a blackbody spectrum with a temperature @xmath32 given by @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the effective temperature ; this approximates the angle dependence of the energy spectrum from a grey atmosphere .    using this approach",
    ", we compute the brightness seen by an observer at infinity as a function of rotational phase , for a given specific intensity distribution and rotation rate .",
    "intensities can be added linearly , so addition of a second pole is straightforward .",
    "we fourier analyze the resulting light curve to determine the oscillation amplitudes at different harmonics of the spin frequency .",
    "the results of our calculations are summarized in figure  1 , which shows the fractional rms amplitudes of countrate oscillations in various situations ( the amplitudes of oscillation in the photon number and total energy fluxes are equal for nonrotating stars but are generally unequal for rotating stars ) .",
    "figure  1a compares the oscillation amplitude for isotropic emission and for the peaked emission @xmath31 from a single pole .",
    "the rms amplitude of a non - sinusoidal waveform can be greater than unity , as shown .",
    "figure  1b shows the fractional rms amplitude at the first overtone under the same assumptions , for two identical , antipodal emitting poles .",
    "figure  1c shows the amplitude as a function of the angle between the observer s line of sight and the rotation equator for a single emitting pole .",
    "figure  1d illustrates the generation of harmonics by doppler shifts and aberration .",
    "figure  1e shows the amplitude as a function of photon energy for different assumptions about the surface velocity and the rest - frame angle - dependence of the energy spectrum .",
    "figure  1f plots the amplitude from two emitting poles as detected by instruments with different bandpasses , as a function of the effective temperature of the surface .",
    "these results illustrate several points .",
    "( 1 )  the maximum relative amplitude is significantly greater when one pole is emitting than when two poles are emitting .",
    "( 2 )  the amplitude tends to be higher when the neutron star is less compact , i.e. , when @xmath35 is larger .",
    "the exception occurs for isotropic emission and very compact neutron stars , @xmath36 , in which case gravitational focusing of emission from the pole on the opposite side of the star from the observer can increase the amplitude ( this effect was discussed by pechenick et al .",
    "[ 1983 ] ) .",
    "( 3 )  the angular distribution of the specific intensity makes a large difference .",
    "for example , for @xmath37 , @xmath38 , two emitting poles , and @xmath39 , the maximum amplitude is nearly three times greater than the maximum amplitude for isotropic emission .",
    "( 4 )  stellar rotation affects the _ bolometric _ amplitude only to second order .",
    "however , rotation shifts the _ energy spectrum _ by an amount that is first order in the rotational velocity . as a result",
    ", the measured relative countrate amplitude depends strongly on photon energy if the energy spectrum within the bandpass of the instrument is steep , and may be large even for two emitting poles .",
    "as figure  1f shows , the measured rms amplitude can exceed @xmath470% for two emitting poles .",
    "the amplitude will also depend strongly on the photon energy if , as expected , the rest - frame energy spectrum depends on the angle from the normal , and hence the amplitude is likely to rise steeply with increasing photon energy even if doppler shifts and aberration are unimportant .",
    "( 5 )  rotation generates significant power at overtones of the spin frequency .",
    "( 6 )  the oscillation amplitude is proportional to the cosine of the angle @xmath40 between the line of sight of the observer and the rotation equator and hence the observed amplitude is near its maximum value over a large solid angle : for example , the observed amplitude for @xmath40 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which occurs 50% of the time for randomly distributed observers , is within 5% of the maximum .",
    "these results have been computed assuming that the only emission from the surface comes from pointlike poles , that if there are two poles then they are identical and antipodal , and that the emitting pole or poles are in the spin equator .",
    "these assumptions produce the largest possible amplitude .",
    "small deviations from them affect the amplitude of the oscillation only to second order in the deviation , as is also evident from the results of pechenick et al .",
    "for example , if emission at the pole comes from a cap of angular radius @xmath43 instead of from a point , then the amplitude is decreased by an amount @xmath44 .",
    "if there are two poles and they are offset from antipodal by a small angle @xmath45 , then the amplitude at twice the spin frequency drops by @xmath46 . if the axis of the pole or poles is offset from the spin equator by a small angle @xmath47 , the amplitude is diminished by @xmath48 .",
    "if the burst is near its onset or its end , gas will be accreting onto the neutron star and is likely to comptonize the radiation coming from the stellar surface ( see psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) .",
    "this introduces two competing effects .",
    "first , scattering tends to isotropize the radiation , diminishing the observed oscillation amplitude ( see , e.g. , brainerd & lamb 1987 ; kylafis & phinney 1989 ; miller 1997 ) .",
    "second , relatively small changes in the optical depth or temperature of the accreting gas with azimuth can change the shape of the spectrum , producing large changes in the flux at high energies with azimuth , thereby increasing the observed amplitude ( see miller , lamb , & psaltis 1997 ; miller & lamb 1992 ) . in principle , either effect could dominate .",
    "the bounds on stellar compactness that we have computed apply only when we are seeing emission coming directly from the stellar surface .",
    "strong evidence that we _ are _ observing such emission is an energy spectrum that is close to a modified blackbody spectrum , because if the radiation from the surface undergoes significant comptonization by the accreting gas , the spectrum generally has an extended high - energy tail ( see , e.g. , psaltis , lamb , & miller 1995 ) .",
    "thus , if a modified blackbody spectrum is observed , the amplitudes of oscillations during x - ray bursts may be used to derive bounds on the compactness of the star .",
    "we are grateful to dimitrios psaltis for many helpful discussions of the amplitudes of burst oscillations , especially about the role of x - ray color oscillations .",
    "we also thank tod strohmayer and jean swank for discussing their burst observations in advance of publication .",
