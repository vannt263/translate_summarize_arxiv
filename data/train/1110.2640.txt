    "events containing isolated same - sign dileptons are very rare in the standard model ( sm ) , but can occur quite naturally in many different new physics models , including supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite and universal extra dimensions  @xcite .",
    "isolated same - sign lepton pairs are thus a very clean experimental signature for new physics searches .    in addition , the analysis described in this talk requires significant missing transverse energy ( @xmath2 ) and hadronic activity in the form of high-@xmath3 jets .",
    "the choice of signal regions is influenced by two experimental observations .",
    "first , astrophysical evidence for dark matter  @xcite suggests the need for a massive , weakly - interacting stable particle which gives rise to final states with @xmath2 .",
    "second , new physics signals with observably large cross sections are likely to be the result of strong interactions , and we therefore expect them to be accompanied by significant hadronic activity . aside from these requirements ,",
    "our searches are as independent of the particular details of new physics models as possible .",
    "the data used in this analysis were collected in @xmath0 collisions at a center - of - mass energy of 7  @xmath1by the compact muon solenoid ( cms ) detector at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) in 2011 .",
    "they comprise a total integrated luminosity of 0.98  .",
    "an example susy cascade decay leading to jets ,  @xmath4 , and same - sign dileptons is shown in figure  [ figure1 ] .",
    "the produced gluinos or squarks decay to charged gauginos , which subsequently decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) neutralino .",
    "the mass difference between the gluinos / squarks and the charged gaugino , typically arbitrary , defines the amount of hadronic activity expected in the event .",
    "the mass difference between the gaugino and neutralino influences the lepton  @xmath5spectrum .",
    "further , there is a range of scenarios where a large production asymmetry exists between the @xmath6 lepton and the @xmath7 leptons .",
    "the range of mass differences motivates a variety of selection criteria in order to cover the widest possible phase space , while the possible tau production asymmetry motivates us to look specifically at events containing taus .",
    "electrons , muons , and hadronically decaying taus are all included in the analysis .",
    "lepton candidates are required to have @xmath8 and to be consistent with originating from the same interaction vertex .",
    "electron candidates  @xcite consist of an energy cluster in the electromagnetic calorimeter ( ecal ) matched to hits in the tracker .",
    "the identification of electrons is based on the shape of their electromagnetic shower in the ecal as well as track - cluster matching .",
    "the criteria are designed to maximally reject electron candidates from qcd multijet production , and are approximately 80% efficient for electrons from the decay of @xmath9 bosons .",
    "muon candidates  @xcite must be reconstructed via two separate algorithms : tracker muons are seeded from hits in the tracker and are matched to signals in the calorimeters and muon systems .",
    "global muons are constructed from a simultaneous fit to hits in both the tracker and muon chambers .",
    "the identification efficiency measured in data is approximately 96% for muons of all momenta",
    ".    jets and  @xmath4are reconstructed via the particle flow ( pf ) technique  @xcite , which takes signals in each detector component and reconstructs physics objects from them before running jet clustering algorithms .",
    "the hadronic jets in this analysis use the anti-@xmath10clustering algorithm with a cone of @xmath11 in @xmath12 space .",
    "hadronic tau candidates  @xcite are reconstructed starting from jets .",
    "a variable size cone of @xmath13 is defined around the leading track , and the @xmath6 decay products are required to be confined within this cone .",
    "the analysis starts from an initial selection of two same - sign leptons with @xmath14 for muons , electrons , and taus , respectively , and @xmath8 .",
    "two jets with @xmath15 and @xmath16 are also required , and we further require @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    this initial selection is further divided into three baseline selections : the _ inclusive _ selection for the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 final states requires @xmath22 .",
    "the _ high-@xmath5 _",
    "selection for the @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 final states requires @xmath23 .",
    "the tau - specific selection requires at least one of the final state particles is a tau ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , or @xmath26 ) with @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "we constrain the baseline selection regions with the following search regions :    * _ high-@xmath29 , high-@xmath4 _ : @xmath30 and @xmath31 , providing a high expected sensitivity to points in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model ( cmssm )  @xcite with low values of @xmath32 . * _",
    "medium-@xmath29 , high-@xmath4 _ : @xmath22 and @xmath31 , targeting models with moderate mass - splittings between squarks / gluinos and gauginos . * _",
    "high-@xmath29 , low-@xmath4 _ : @xmath30 and @xmath33 , providing a high expected sensitivity to cmssm parameter points with high values of @xmath32 . * _",
    "low-@xmath29 , high-@xmath4 _ : @xmath17 and @xmath34 , providing a high expected sensitivity to models predicting low hadronic activity with high  @xmath4 .",
    "figure  [ fig : figure2 ] shows the events observed in data on the  @xmath29-@xmath4plane for each baseline selection categories , with the dashed and dotted lines indicating the various search regions .",
    "backgrounds are divided into categories based on how many prompt leptons they contain .",
    "rare processes like @xmath35 and @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 can produce actual prompt same - sign leptons .",
    "these are evaluated from monte carlo ( mc ) simulation and found to contribute between 10% and 40% of the total background .",
    "a 50% systematic uncertainty is applied to the value .",
    "processes such as @xmath40 and @xmath41 produce opposite - sign prompt leptons . in cases where the charge of one of the leptons is misreconstructed , these events constitute an additional background to the search .",
    "they are evaluated in data and found to contribute less than 10% to the total background .",
    "events with `` fake '' leptons from jets also contribute . here",
    ", a fake lepton can be a lepton produced in a heavy flavor quark decay as well as a light jet that is misidentified as a lepton .",
    "this is also evaluated in data , and is found to be the dominant effect . in order to evaluate this fake rate , the analysis loosens the lepton selection criteria ( such as lepton isolation requirements ) to define a set of `` fakeable objects '' . the ratio of lepton candidates passing the full selection ( _ tight _ leptons ) to lepton candidates passing this looser selection but failing the full selection ( _ loose _ leptons ) is then determined for qcd multijet events with a jet above a given threshold .",
    "this tight - to - loose ( tl ) ratio is shown for both electrons and muons in figure  [ fig : figure10 ] .",
    "a summary of the background predictions as well as the number of observed events is shown for each channel in the three baseline selection regions in figure  [ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "for the inclusive and high-@xmath5dilepton selections , two sets of complementary methods are used to measure the backgrounds , as indicated by the two bars associated with each channel .",
    "these methods compare well with each other , providing mutually consistent background predictions .",
    "table  [ table1 ] shows the events observed for each selection region , along with the total background predictions .",
    "we see no evidence of an event yield in excess of the background predictions and set 95% cl upper limits on the number of observed events using a hybrid frequentist - bayesian cl method  @xcite with nuisance parameters and the signal strengh maximizing the ratio of the signal - with - background to background - only likelihoods .",
    "these limits are indicated in the bottom row of the table .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table1 ]",
    "it is necessary to convey the information shown in table  [ table1 ] in a form that can be used to test a variety of specific physics models .",
    "this is done by using generator - level simulation studies as approximations for the models .",
    "this was shown to be sufficiently precise to reproduce constraints on new physics models that would otherwise require the full cms detector simulation .",
    "we take as a benchmark point the low - mass cmssm parameter point lm6 .",
    "the efficiency of the lepton selection is shown in figure  [ fig : figure16 ] as a function of  @xmath5 , and the efficiency of the  @xmath29and  @xmath4selection is shown in figure  [ fig : figure17 ] as a function of the reconstructed  @xmath29and  @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "this efficiency dependence can be parametrized by error functions to determine the overall selection efficiency for new physics signals .",
    "in order to provide a reference for other susy searches , the results are interpreted in the context of the cmssm model .",
    "the observed upper limits on the number of signal events shown in table  [ table1 ] for the high-@xmath29 , high-@xmath4search region of the high-@xmath5dilepton baseline selection are compared to the expected number of events in the cmssm model in a plane of ( @xmath42 ) for @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 .",
    "all points on this plane with mean expected values in excess of this limit are interpreted as excluded at the 95% cl .",
    "this excluded region is shown in figure  [ figure5 ] .",
    "the shaded region represents the uncertainty on the position of the limit due to uncertainty in the production cross section of cmssm .",
    "a search for new physics was performed in the same - sign dilepton channel , including final states with electrons , muons , and taus .",
    "all major background sources were estimated directly from data .",
    "events with a single fake lepton were found to be the dominant background in all channels of the search with the exception of the @xmath26 channel , where two fake @xmath6 leptons were the primary background contribution .",
    "no evidence was seen for an excess over the background prediction .",
    "we therefore set 95% cl upper limits on the number of signal events within @xmath8 with 0.98  of data .",
    "these limits are reported as an exclusion curve in cmssm parameter space ."
