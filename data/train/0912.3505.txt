    "as a consequence of dynamic chiral symmetry breaking , the goldstone bosons @xmath0 dress the nucleon and alter its spectrum .",
    "not surprisingly , pseudoscalar meson production has been a powerful tool in studying the spectrum of excited nucleon states .",
    "however , such states are short lived and broad so that above the energy of the first resonance , the @xmath1(1232 ) , the excitation spectrum is a complicated overlap of many resonances . isolating any one and separating it from backgrounds",
    "has been a long - standing problem in the literature .",
    "the spin degrees of freedom in meson photo - production provide signatures of interfering partial wave strength that are often dramatic and have been useful for differentiating between models of meson production amplitudes .",
    "models that must account for interfering resonance amplitudes and non - resonant contributions are often severely challenged by new polarization data .",
    "ideally , one would like to partition the problem by first determining the amplitudes from experiment , at least to within a phase , and then relying upon a model to separate resonances from non - resonant processes .",
    "single - pseudoscalar photo - production is described by 4  complex amplitudes ( two for the spin states of the photon , two for the nucleon target and two for the baryon recoil , which parity considerations reduces to a total of 4 ) . to avoid ambiguities , it was shown@xcite that angular distribution measurements of at least 8 carefully chosen observables at each energy for both proton and neutron targets must be performed .",
    "while such experimental information has not yet been available , even after 50 years of photo - production experiments , a sequence of _ complete _ experiments are now underway at jefferson lab @xcite , as well as complementary experiments at the electron facilities in bonn and mainz , with the goal of obtaining a direct determination of the amplitude to within a phase , for at least a few production channels , notably @xmath2 and possibly @xmath3 .",
    "our purpose here is to assemble the relations between experimental observables and the chew - goldberger - low - nambu ( cgln ) amplitudes @xcite , and to clarify sign differences that exist in the literature .",
    "the four cgln amplitudes can be expressed in cartesian @xmath4 , spherical or helicity @xmath5 , or transversity @xmath6 representations . while the latter two choices afford some theoretical simplifications when predicting asymmetries from model amplitudes @xcite , when working in the reverse direction , fitting asymmetries to extract amplitudes , such simplifications are largely moot . in practice ,",
    "one expands the amplitudes in multipoles and fits the multipoles directly .",
    "this both facilitates the search for resonance behavior and allows the use of full angular distribution data at a fixed energy to constrain angle - independent quantities .",
    "( extracting the four cgln amplitudes directly would require separate fits at each angle , along with some way of constraining an arbitrary phase which could be angle dependent . ) here we restrict our considerations to the cgln @xmath7 representation , which has the simplest decomposition into multipoles @xcite , eqs .",

    "there are 16 possible observables , the cross section ( @xmath8 ) , three single polarization asymmetries determined by the beam , target or recoil polarizations ( @xmath9,t , p ) , and three sets of four asymmetries that depend on the polarization combinations of beam - target ( bt ) , beam - recoil ( br ) and target - recoil ( tr ) , as in @xcite .",
    "expressions for at least some of these observables in terms of the cgln @xmath7 appear already in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "the available complete expressions can be classified into two groups @xcite and @xcite . in all cases",
    "we have found in the literature , the magnitudes of the expressions relating the cgln @xmath7 to experimental observables are identical , but the signs of some appear to differ . in particular , sign differences have occurred in double - polarization observables for which little data have been available until very recently .",
    "there is also a set of 37 _ fierz _ identities interrelating the 16 polarization observables , the most complete list being given in @xcite .",
