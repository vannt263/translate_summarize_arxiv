    "the m31 globular cluster ( gc ) b158 ( a.k.a . bo 158 ) , named following the revised bologna catalogue v3.4 @xcite , contains a bright x - ray source that was discovered by the einstein observatory @xcite , and has shown up in every x - ray observation of the region since ; we call this x - ray source xb158 .",
    "xb158 exhibited strong intensity modulation on a 10017@xmath050 s ( @xmath12.78 hr ) period during the 2002 january xmm - newton observation @xcite .",
    "@xcite found similar variation in the folded lightcurves from a 1991 june rosat observation and a 2000 june xmm - newton observation ; they found that the amplitude of modulation decreased with increasing source intensity .",
    "they found no such modulation in the 2001 june xmm - newton observation , setting a 2@xmath3 upper limit of 10% modulation . assuming that this represents the orbital period",
    ", @xcite found that this is probably a neutron star binary with a low mass donor with a separation @xmath510@xmath6 cm ( i.e. a low mass xb - ray binary , lmxb ) .",
    "however , analysis of the unfolded 2000 june xmm - newton lightcurve revealed a single deep dip at the end of the observation , with no evidence for dips in the two previous orbital cycles @xcite .",
    "furthermore , @xcite analyzed 3 proprietary xmm - newton observations over 2004 july 1719 , finding @xmath1100% dipping for one orbital cycle , and zero evidence for dips in other cycles ; we concluded that the disk was precessing , with dips only visible for some part of the super - orbital cycle .",
    "such behavior is associated with the `` superhump '' phenomenon that is observed in accreting binaries where the mass ratio is smaller than @xmath10.3 @xcite .",
    "superhumps were first identified in the superoutbursts of the su uma subclass of cataclysmic variables ( accreting white dwarf binaries ) , manifesting as a periodic increase in the optical brightness on a period that is slightly longer than the orbital period @xcite .",
    "su umas are a subclass of dwarf novae with orbital periods @xmath72 hr , that exhibit occasional superoutbursts that last @xmath85 times as long as the normal outbursts @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed that these superoutbursts are enhanced by a tidal instability that occurs when the outer disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the secondary ; the additional tidal torque causes the disk to elongate and precess , and also greatly enhances the loss of angular momentum ( and therefore the accretion rate ) .",
    "the disk precession is prograde in the rest frame , and the secondary repeats its motion with respect to the disk on the beat period between the orbital period and the precession period , a few percent longer than the orbital period .",
    "the secondary modulates the disk s viscous dissipation on this period , giving rise to the maxima in the optical lightcurve known as superhumps . some short period , persistently bright cvs exhibit permanent superhumps @xcite .",

    "it exhibits periodic x - ray intensity dips due to absorption by material in the outer disk ; the amplitude of these dips varies over @xmath10 to @xmath1100% on a @xmath14 day period , the precession period of the disk @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that ns lmxbs with orbital periods shorter than @xmath14.2 hr are likely to exhibit superhumps , and identified 4u 1916 - 053 as a persistent superhumping source .",
    "xb158 appears to be somewhat analogous to 4u 1916@xmath12053 @xcite .    in @xcite",
    "we modeled the 2004 july 17 xmm - newton pn spectrum of xb158 with a blackbody and a power law , finding @xmath13 = 2.0@xmath00.2 kev , the photon index @xmath14 = 2.0@xmath00.3 , @xmath4/dof = 19/19 and the 0.310 kev luminosity was 1.5@xmath00.6@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 ; fitting a single power law emission model yielded a photon index of 0.57@xmath00.09 , which is harder than any black hole spectrum @xcite , meaning that the accretor is a neutron star .",
    "we conducted three dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) modeling , assuming a 1.4 @xmath17 ns , a 2.78 hr period , a total system mass of 1.8 @xmath17 , and a luminosity @xmath180% of the eddington limit . as a result , we estimated the disk precession period to be 29@xmath01 times the orbital period , i.e. 81@xmath03 hr .    in @xcite we examined chandra observations of @xmath130 m31 globular cluster x - ray sources spanning @xmath112 years ( 89 acis and 45 hrc ) , including xb158 .",
    "we observed 0.310 kev luminosities @xmath1420@xmath18 erg s@xmath16 , and proposed that this is due to varying accretion rates over the disk precession cycle .",
    "since we expected a super - orbital period for xb158 over time - scales of a few days , we obtained a series of 30 swift observations , each with 2.5 ks exposure and spaced @xmath11 day apart . in this work we present our analysis of these swift results , and find evidence for a super - orbital period of @xmath16 days",
    "we made 30 swift observations over 2013 february 8  march 9 ( obsids 00327020010032702030 , pi r. barnard ) .",
    "xb158 was one of two main targets for this survey , and the pointing was chosen to optimize the results from both targets .",
    "however , the actual pointings varied significantly over the 30 observations .",
    "a journal of swift observations is provided in table  [ journ ] ; for each observation we give the time relative to the first observation , pointing , xrt exposure , and off - axis angle , along with the net source counts .",
    "for each observation , we placed circular regions around xb158 and a suitable background region .",
    "we obtained the net source counts using the `` counts in regions '' tool in the ds9 image viewer , and estimated the intensity by dividing the net counts by the exposure time .",
    "these data were obtained in order to determine the extent to which the varying off - axis angles affected our results .",
    "we also created spectra from the same extraction regions , created appropriate ancillary response files using xrtmkarf , and found the appropriate response file using the quzcif tool .",
    "none of the spectra were suitable for free spectral fitting , hence we obtained luminosity estimates by assuming a model obtained from previous observations . for chandra acis observations with @xmath2200 net source photons , the mean line - of - sight absorption ( @xmath19 ) was 9@xmath04@xmath20 atom @xmath21 ( @xmath4/dof = 7/11 ) , and the mean power law index ( @xmath14 ) was 0.52@xmath00.03 ( @xmath4/dof = 5/11 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the best absorbed power law fit to the 2004 july 17 xmm - newton observation ( @xmath19 = 0.1 , @xmath14 = 0.57@xmath00.09 , @xmath4/dof = 30/24 * ? ? ?",
    "as we noted earlier , that xmm - newton spectrum was best described by a blackbody + power law model , but neither the chandra nor swift spectra were sufficient to constrain the two - component emission model .",
    "however , we were able to estimate the luminosity for each observation by assuming a fixed emission model , allowing only the normalization to vary .",
    "we fitted each spectrum using xspec 12.8.2b , fixing @xmath19 = 9@xmath20 atom @xmath21 and @xmath14 = 0.52 , to find the normalization required to make absorbed model intensity 1.00 count s@xmath16 .",
    "we then calculated the unabsorbed flux for this model , allowing us to convert from intensity to flux .",
    "multiplying the conversion by the background - subtracted intensity provided by xspec yielded the instrument - corrected , background - subtracted source flux .",
    "the luminosity was calculated from the flux assuming a distance of 780 kpc @xcite .",
    "we fitted the lightcurve with constant and sinusoidal components using the qdp program provided in heatools , performing a simple search for periodicity .",
    "@xcite created a periodogram suitable for unbinned data with a mean of zero that produces exactly equivalent results to such least - squares fitting of sinewaves , but also allows comparison of the best period with other periods .",
    "the likelihood that any peak in the periodogram is real is given by the false alarm probability ( @xmath22 ) , where a low value of @xmath22 indicates that the peak is likely to be significant .",
    "if the highest frequency to be probed is @xmath23 times higher than the lowest frequency , then the power , @xmath24 , required for a false alarm probability @xmath22 is given by @xmath24 = @xmath25 $ ] ; for small @xmath22 , @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we present our 30 day , 0.310 kev swift xrt lightcurve of xb158 in figure  [ swiftlc ] .",
    "we see that the 0.310 kev luminosity varied by a factor @xmath15 ; the luminosity dropped from @xmath12.3@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 to @xmath15@xmath18 erg s@xmath16 in @xmath12 days , assuming the mean chandra absorbed power law model .",
    "we note that these swift observations are non - contiguous , spacing the 2.5 ks observing time over several hours ; the low intensities ( @xmath10.0050.025 count s@xmath16 ) meant that there was no appreciable variability within each observation .",
    "we find no evidence for a dependence of luminosity on off - axis angle ; the luminosities for the observations when xb158 have the largest and smallest off - axis angles have consistent values , while observations at an off - axis angle of 8.2@xmath11 resulted in a factor @xmath15 range in luminosity .",
    "the conversion factor for translating 1 count s@xmath16 into 0.310 kev flux ranged over 1.091.29@xmath27 erg @xmath21 count@xmath16 for all observations except the second one , where it was 1.79@xmath27 erg @xmath21 count@xmath16 .",
    "this @xmath110% variation about the mean in instrumental correction is clearly not sufficient to account for the factor @xmath15 variation in luminosity .",
    "fitting our lightcurve with a constant intensity yielded a best fit luminosity of @xmath11.3@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 , with @xmath4 = 181 for 29 degrees of freedom ( dof ) .",
    "however , adding a sinusoidal variation component yielded a much improved fit , with @xmath4/dof = 43/26 ; for this model , the period is 5.65@xmath00.05 days , with an amplitude of 7.1@xmath00.6@xmath18 erg s@xmath16 around a mean luminosity of 1.43@xmath00.04@xmath15 erg s@xmath16 , and a phase of 88.1@xmath00.7 degrees .",
    "all uncertainties in this work are quoted at the 1@xmath3 level .",
    "this sinusoidal variability yielded @xmath28 = 138 for 30 bins , with 3 extra free parameters ; f - testing showed that the probability for this improvement being due to chance was 3@xmath29 , equivalent to a @xmath25@xmath3 detection . in figure  [ swift_per ]",
    "we show our swift lightcurve folded on a 5.65 day period and fitted with the best fit sinusoid .",
    "we present our lomb - scargle periodogram for the 0.310 kev swift xrt luminosity lightcurve of xb158 in figure  [ ls ] , and also indicate the power required for false alarm probabilities @xmath22 = 0.5 , 0.05 , and 0.005 for reference .",
    "we tested 30 frequencies , and oversampled each frequency by a factor of 50 ; this resulted in a periodogram covering a wider range of periods than is interesting ( up to @xmath11500 days ) , so we show only part of the periodogram here .",
    "the periodogram shows a single strong peak , with the maximum power of 10.4 at a period of 5.60 days , corresponding to @xmath22 = 0.0009 ; the range of periods which are detected at a @xmath23@xmath3 level is 5.45.8 days . while there is a small peak at the 3 day period , @xmath22 = 1 for this peak",
    "xb158 is a high inclination x - ray binary associated with the m31 globular cluster b158 .",
    "it exhibits deep intensity dips on a 2.78 hr period in some observations but not others , prompting @xcite to suggest that the disk is precessing , caused by the `` superhumping '' phenomenon observed in low mass ratio systems where the disk crosses the 3:1 resonance with the donor star .",
    "@xcite predicted a disk precession period of 29@xmath01 times the orbital period , i.e. 81@xmath03 hr , inspiring a month of daily monitoring of the m31 central region by swift . fitting a sinusoid to",
    "the lightcurve revealed a 5.65@xmath00.05 day super - orbital period ( 1@xmath3 uncertainties ) ; the 0.310 kev luminosity varied by a factor @xmath15 , which is consistent with the range of luminosities observed in the acis observations of our 13 + year chandra monitoring campaign @xcite .",
    "the peak of the lomb - scargle periodogram is at 5.6 days , consistent with that obtained from least squares fitting of the lightcurve with a sinusoid .",
    "the suggested super - orbital period is @xmath170% longer than predicted by our 3d sph simulations @xcite .",
    "none of the authors of the current paper are experts in sph ; however , j.  r. murray stated in a private communication that the longer than expected super - orbital period is likely due to the mass ratio of the donor to the accretor being lower than assumed .",
    "the mass of a roche lobe filling main sequence star , @xmath30 , may be approximated as @xmath30 @xmath31 0.11 @xmath32 , where @xmath32 is the orbital period in hours @xcite , and we originally assumed a donor mass of @xmath10.30 @xmath17 .",
    "for the accretor , we assumed a 1.4 @xmath33 neutron star .",
    "a power law emission model fit to the 2004 july 16 xmm - newton spectrum of b158 yielded a photon index of 0.57@xmath00.09 @xcite , which is considerably harder than any spectrum emitted by a black hole binary .",
    "however , some neutron stars have masses @xmath22@xmath17 ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and it is possible that xb158 contains a particularly massive neutron star .",
    "we noted in @xcite that other xbs such as xb146 exhibited strong luminosity fluctuations between fairly consistent maxima and minima during our chandra monitoring observations , and suggested that this long - term behavior could be indicative of a short period / low mass ratio system .",
    "our new findings support this hypothesis .",
    "we thank the anonymous referees for suggesting improvements to this work , in particular prompting more rigorous estimation of the super - orbital period .",
    "we thank the swift team for making this work possible .",
