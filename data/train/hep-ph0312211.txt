    "the hadronization of currents in exclusive processes provide a detailed knowledge on the strong interacting mechanisms driven by non  perturbative qcd . within this framework @xmath2",
    "decays into hadrons allow to study the properties of the vector and axial  vector qcd currents , and yield relevant information on the dynamics of the resonances entering into the processes . at very low energies , typically @xmath3 ( being @xmath4 the mass of the @xmath5(770 ) ) , chiral perturbation theory",
    "( @xmath6pt ) @xcite is the corresponding effective theory of qcd .",
    "however the decays @xmath0 , through their full energy spectrum , happen to be driven by the @xmath5(770 ) and @xmath1(1260 ) resonances , mainly , in an energy region where the invariant hadron momentum approaches the masses of the resonances ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "consequently @xmath6pt is no longer applicable to the study of the whole spectrum but only to the very low energy domain @xcite . until now",
    "the standard way of dealing with these decays has been to use @xmath8 @xmath6pt to fix the normalization of the amplitudes in the low energy region and , accordingly , to include the effects of vector and axial  vector meson resonances by modulating the amplitudes with ad hoc breit  wigner functions @xcite .",
    "however we have seen @xcite that this modelization is not consistent with @xmath9 @xmath6pt , a fact that could spoil any outcome provided by the analysis of experimental data using this procedure .",
    "lately several experiments have collected good quality data on @xmath0 , such as branching ratios and spectra @xcite or structure functions @xcite .",
    "their analysis within a model ",
    "independent framework is highly desirable if one wishes to collect information on the hadronization of the relevant qcd currents . at energies @xmath10 the resonance mesons are active degrees of freedom that can not be integrated out , as in @xmath6pt , and they have to be properly included into the relevant lagrangian .",
    "the procedure is ruled by the approximated chiral symmetry of qcd under @xmath11 , that drives the interaction of goldstone bosons ( the lightest octet of pseudoscalar mesons ) , and the @xmath12 assignments of the resonance multiplets .",
    "its systematic arrangement has been put forward in refs .",
    "@xcite as the resonance chiral theory ( r@xmath6 t ) .",
    "a complementary tool is the large number of colours ( @xmath13 ) limit of qcd .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that the inverse of the number of colours of the gauge group @xmath14 could provide the expansion parameter involved in the perturbative treatment of the amplitudes .",
    "indeed large@xmath13 qcd shows features that resemble , both qualitatively and quantitatively , the @xmath15 case .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we have performed an analysis of the @xmath0 decays using de above  mentioned tools , and we present in the following its main results .",
    "the final hadron system in the @xmath0 decays spans a wide energy region @xmath16 that is heavily populated by resonances . as a consequence an effective theory description of the full energy spectrum requires to include the resonances as active degrees of freedom .",
