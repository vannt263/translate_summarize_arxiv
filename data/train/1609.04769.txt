    "in the last two decades , the study of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) bound states has evolved from static , one - dimensional snapshots of quarks and gluons to focus on multidimensional structure and the dynamics of partons .",
    "the theoretical framework that has been developed to describe parton dynamics in hadrons involves transverse - momentum - dependent ( tmd ) parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and fragmentation functions ( ffs ) . in traditional collinear pdfs and ffs ,",
    "any momentum of the partons transverse to the hadron boost axis is integrated over . in tmd pdfs or ffs , the transverse momentum of the partons",
    "is not integrated out and instead remains explicit in the pdf or ff , offering a means of describing the transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized partons within an unpolarized hadron , as well as a variety of spin - momentum correlations when polarized hadrons and/or partons are considered .",
    "early theoretical work in tmd pdfs took place in the 1980s by collins , soper , and sterman  @xcite , with extensive further development in the 1990s ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "however , some theoretical details regarding the definition of tmd pdfs within a perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) framework have only been clarified in the last five years  @xcite .",
    "we note that due to confinement , the behavior of partons within hadrons is nonperturbative in that it can not be calculated theoretically within pqcd .",
    "collinear or tmd pdfs are nonperturbative functions that can be constrained by and/or used to predict high - energy scattering processes within a pqcd framework .",
    "in such a framework , the nonperturbative functions such as pdfs as well as ffs factorize from the perturbatively calculable partonic hard scattering cross section and from each other .",
    "lattice qcd offers an alternative , complementary approach to pqcd , performing numerical nonperturbative calculations directly . in the past lattice qcd could only calculate moments of pdfs , integrated over parton collinear momentum fraction @xmath12 as well as parton transverse momentum .",
    "however , recent developments have demonstrated the potential to go beyond these limitations .",
    "these efforts are still in very early stages  @xcite .",
    "there is already experimental evidence from semi - inclusive deep - inelastic scattering ( sidis ) and drell - yan ( dy ) measurements that several tmd pdfs describing spin - momentum correlations are nonzero  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there is empirical evidence for nonzero spin - momentum correlations in the process of hadronization from electron - positron annihilation as well as sidis  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , transverse single - spin asymmetries up to @xmath1340% have been measured in inclusive hadron production in hadronic collisions , indicating large nonperturbative spin - momentum correlations in these processes ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . however",
    ", these measurements can not probe tmd functions directly because there is no simultaneous observation of perturbative and nonperturbative momentum scales .",
    "the recent focus on multidimensional structure and parton dynamics has not only offered richer information on the behavior of partons confined within hadrons , but has moreover brought to light fundamental predictions regarding qcd as a nonabelian gauge - invariant quantum field theory .",
    "in particular , the role of color interactions due to soft gluon exchanges with the remnants of the hard scattering have become clearer .",
    "because tmd functions preserve more nonperturbative information compared to collinear functions , tmd functions can differ from collinear ones with regards to universality and factorization .",
    "for example , the sivers tmd pdf  @xcite , a correlation between the proton spin and quark transverse momentum , was shown to possibly be nonzero due to phase interference effects from soft gluon exchanges in sidis  @xcite . shortly afterward ,",
    "@xcite showed that , due to the gauge invariant nature of qcd and the parity and time ( pt ) odd nature of the sivers tmd pdf , the function should be the same magnitude but opposite in sign when measured in drell - yan vs. sidis processes because of the different color flows possible in the initial state vs. final state . twist-2 tmd pdfs that involve one polarization vector are odd under pt transformations , leading to this predicted effect .",
    "the nonvanishing nature of the sivers function has already been measured in polarized sidis  @xcite ; there is not yet a measurement of this function in polarized drell - yan . a first indication from the drell - yan like w boson production exists  @xcite .",
    "the results favor a sign - change if tmd evolution effects are small , but at this stage the error bars are still large enough that a definitive statement can not be drawn from this single measurement .",
    "it is only for the tmd pdfs odd under pt transformations , where such sign - change behavior is expected , that gluon exchanges can not be completely eliminated via a gauge transformation .    in the more complicated qcd process to hadrons ,",
    "soft gluon exchanges in both the initial and final state are possible , leading to new predicted effects for observables sensitive to a small transverse momentum scale . in such processes , factorization breaking has been predicted  @xcite in both polarized and unpolarized interactions . here",
    "the nonperturbative objects in the cross section become correlated with one another and can not be factorized into a convolution of tmd pdfs or tmd ffs .",
    "however , there are no theoretical claims that the perturbative partonic cross section does not factorize from the nonperturbative physics . similarly to the case of the tmd pdfs that are odd under pt transformations , gluon exchanges that lead to the predicted factorization breaking can not be eliminated via a gauge transformation .",
    "it is important to recognize that the ideas behind the predicted sign change of certain tmd pdfs and factorization breaking represent a major qualitative departure from previous purely perturbative approaches that do not account for soft gluon exchanges with remnants of the hard scattering .",
    "possibly related effects known as  color coherence \" have been studied and observed in multijet states in hadronic collisions  @xcite , but these types of effects have not been rigorously treated in a tmd framework .    in calculations of tmd processes",
    "where factorization is predicted to hold , the evolution with the hard scale of the interaction is known to be governed by the collins - soper ( cs ) evolution equation  @xcite .",
    "note that the cs evolution equation comes directly out of the derivation of tmd factorization  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the dglap collinear evolution equations  @xcite , which are purely perturbative , the kernel for the cs evolution equation for tmd processes involves the collins - soper - sterman ( css ) soft factor  @xcite , which generally contains nonperturbative contributions .",
    "the soft factor is understood to be strongly universal , the same for unpolarized and polarized processes , pdfs and ffs , with the only difference being between quarks and gluons  @xcite .",
    "because lattice calculations of the soft factor are currently not possible , the soft factor must be extracted from parameterizations of experimental measurements within a pqcd framework . for a discussion of the css soft factor and tmd evolution phenomenology ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the theoretical expectation from css evolution is that any momentum width sensitive to nonperturbative @xmath14 would grow as the hard scale increases .",
    "this can be understood intuitively as a broadening of the phase space for gluon radiation with increasing hard scale .",
    "in addition this has been studied and observed in multiple phenomenological analyses of drell - yan and z boson data  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , as well as phenomenological analyses of sidis data , where factorization is also predicted to hold  ( see e.g.  @xcite ) . as mentioned above , because the cs evolution equation comes directly out of the derivation of tmd factorization , it then follows that a promising avenue to investigate factorization breaking effects is by looking for qualitative differences from css evolution in processes where factorization breaking is expected , such as nearly back - to - back dihadron correlations produced in collisions .    to have sensitivity to possible factorization breaking and modified tmd evolution effects",
    ", a particular observable must be sensitive to a small scale on the order of @xmath15 and measured over a range of hard scales .",
    "nearly back - to - back dihadron production has long been used as a proxy for measuring initial - state partonic transverse momentum @xmath14  @xcite , which is defined in fig .",
    "[ fig : ktkinematics ] . first used in predictions by ref .",

    "direct photon - hadron correlations are of particular interest because the photon comes directly from the partonic hard scattering , and thus carries initial - state information without any final - state fragmentation effects .",
    "the direct photon approximates the away - side jet energy at leading order ( lo ) while still being directly sensitive to the partonic transverse momentum scale .",
    "direct photons also give an interesting comparison to dihadron production because they do not carry color charge , thus , assuming factorization holds , only two tmd pdfs and one tmd ff are necessary in the cross section calculation compared to two tmd pdfs and two tmd ffs in dihadron production .",
    "therefore , there should be more avenues for gluon exchange in nearly back - to - back dihadron events when compared to direct photon - hadron events .",
