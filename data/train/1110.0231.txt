    "aluminium oxide ( @xmath6 ) , also known as alumina , is one of the most important oxides because of its many industrial applications@xcite .",
    "corundum ( @xmath1-@xmath6 ) , the most stable and common crystalline form of alumina , is the final product of the calcination of hydroxides or oxyhydroxides of aluminium at temperatures above 1273 k , which can vary according to the precursor .",
    "the transformation from aluminium hydrates to the final oxide is not direct and a variety of relatively stable intermediate phases can be detected for each combination of starting compound and thermal treatment .",
    "the most commonly used precursors in the synthesis of the various alumina phases are gibbsite [ @xmath4-@xmath7 , bayerite [ @xmath1-@xmath7 , and boehmite [ @xmath4-@xmath8 . the transformation of gibbsite to corundum can proceed through a sequence of hexagonal close packed aluminas ( @xmath9 and @xmath3 ) or an alternative sequence in which boehmite is initially formed and the @xmath1 phase is achieved via the cubic spinel transition phases ( @xmath4 , @xmath10 , and @xmath2)@xcite .",
    "bayerite can also follow this same sequence through boehmite to form corundum@xcite or an alternative path transforming to @xmath11 and @xmath2 phases@xcite .    among the transition aluminas ,",
    "the @xmath4 phase is highly valued for industrial applications due to its textural properties ( surface area , pore volume , pore size ) , which makes it an important material in many industrial processes acting as an adsorbent , a catalyst and/or catalyst support . in petroleum and petrochemical industries @xmath4-alumina",
    "is used as catalyst support for transition - metal sulfides co(ni)mos in hydrotreatment catalysts and metallic alloys in reforming catalysts@xcite . due to its low crystallinity and the consequent difficulty in characterization ,",
    "the debate on the structure of @xmath4-alumina remains open and a series of theoretical and experimental works concerning this subject have been published along the decades@xcite .",
    "since the transition between the distinct intermediate phases is a gradual process , the precise temperature at which each phase is obtained with a high degree of purity can not be determined by x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) experiments only .",
    "solid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( ss - nmr ) is an important technique for material characterization .",
    "long - range order is not a prerequisite to distinguish different phases and the knowledge of @xmath0 nmr data can allow the detection of the onset of phase changes during alumina calcination@xcite , permitting a discussion of the transition mechanisms@xcite .",
    "a detailed interpretation of the results remains , however , a challenge .",
    "the advent of theoretical techniques such as the gauge - including projector augmented wave ( gipaw ) method@xcite enables the _ ab initio _ calculation of isotropic chemical shielding , @xmath12 , quadrupolar coupling constant , @xmath13 , and asymmetry parameter , @xmath14 , in solids .",
    "first principles simulations of nmr spectra of structural models for transition aluminas are now possible@xcite and can be compared with available experimental data .    in this paper",
    "we apply the gipaw method to compute solid state magic angle spinning ( mas ) nmr parameters for a number of well characterized aluminium oxide phases and for their boehmite and gibbsite precursors .",
    "the results are compared with available experimental data to validate the method . in order to contribute to a better characterization of @xmath4-alumina , a number of structural models , proposed in the literature ,",
    "are examined and their simulated spectra compared to experimental ones , thus revealing their adequacy .",
    "we then examine possible correlations of the predicted chemical shifts with local atomic geometry or local electronic structure , described through bader analysis@xcite and born dynamical effective charges@xcite , finding significant correlations .",

    "we have also studied the nmr spectra of precursor phases gibbsite and boehmite . for gibbsite",
    "we started from the structure resolved by saalfeld and wedde in a single - crystal xrd study@xcite .",
    "the structure is monoclinic with @xmath28 space group where the @xmath27 cations are octahedrally coordinated by 6 @xmath29 groups forming double layers and occupy two thirds of the octahedral holes in alternate layers@xcite .",
    "the interlayer cohesion is granted by hydrogen bonds between these @xmath29 groups .    in the also layered boehmite structure , described by christensen  _",
    "et  al._@xcite , each @xmath27 cation is octahedrally coordinated by 2 @xmath29 groups and 4 intralayer @xmath30 anions in an orthorhombic system with @xmath31 space group .",
    "as in the gibbsite structure , the boehmite double layers interact with each other via hydrogen bonds , which are exclusively interlayer . in this phase ,",
    "hydrogen bonds are organized in chains along [ 001 ] direction and different bond networks are possible depending on the relative orientation of neighboring chains . in our calculations we considered all possible combinations compatible with a 2@xmath322 supercell .",
    "the structure with the lowest energy was found to be the one where nearest neighbor chains are antiparallel .",
    "however energy differences among various combinations are found to be less than 1 mry / cell which is consistent with the experimentally observed disorder in this phase@xcite .    as one of the aims of this work",
    "is to contribute to the characterization of @xmath4-alumina phase , four different @xmath4-alumina structural models from published theoretical works have been studied .",
    "the first @xmath4-phase model , @xmath4-@xmath33 , considered here was proposed by gutierrez  _ et  al._@xcite this model , also called _ defect spinel _ or _ spinel - like _ structure , consists of a cell with 8 @xmath6 units , in which 37.5% of the cations are @xmath25 and 62.5% are @xmath24 . among the 24 o atoms , 12 are four - fold coordinated ( @xmath34 ) and 12 are three - fold coordinated ( @xmath35 ) to aluminium atoms@xcite .",

    "two other @xmath4-phase models were published by paglia  _ et  al._@xcite .",
    "the unit cells of these models contain a large number of atoms , 32 @xmath6 units , and were generated from an extensive search on all structural possibilities of the @xmath4-@xmath6 structures using @xmath5 and @xmath38 space groups . in the @xmath5 model , @xmath4-@xmath39 , among the 64 @xmath27 sites 22 are @xmath25 , 41 are @xmath24 and 1 is @xmath40 ( five - coordinated ) , while in the @xmath38 model , @xmath4-@xmath41 , there are 21 @xmath25 and 43 @xmath24 sites . in these two models , due to the breaking of the local symmetry by the variations in cation occupancies and related distortions in octahedral and tetrahedral sites ,",

    "it should be noted that in the study by pecharromn  _ et  al._@xcite , the complex nmr spectrum in the @xmath4-alumina region was analyzed as superposition of a small number of peaks for which the quadrupolar interaction parameters were estimated for tetrahedral ( @xmath13 = 4.7 - 4.9 mhz ) and octahedral ( @xmath13 = 3.6 - 3.9 mhz ) sites .",
    "these estimated values do not agree with the ones obtained for model c. since model c shows very good agreement for the total spectrum , this implies that extracting nmr parameters from a complex spectrum , in absence of further experimental or theoretical charaterization , is likely an unreliable procedure as it can result in widely different distributions of nmr parameters for the same spectrum .          in the literature",
    "there have been several attempts to correlate features in nmr spectra with local structural details such as coordination numbers  @xcite , local atomic bondlength and angular distortion  @xcite , shortest bond - length  @xcite , mulliken charge population  @xcite etc .",
    "our calculations confirm the dependence of chemical shifts on aluminium coordination numbers , such that 4- , 5- and 6-coordinated aluminium sites show chemical shifts in well separated ranges : the lower the coordination number the larger is the chemical shift .",
    "however , the internal distribution within a given coordination number does not correlate with local geometric descriptors such as local bondlength , angular distortions  @xcite , or shortest bondlength@xcite . to explain this we performed a simple test in the _ non - spinel _ model b for @xmath4-alumina by displacing an oxygen atom while keeping the rest fixed and we observed that the nmr parameters were affected in a region extending up to the third coordination shell , thus demonstrating the sensitivity of nmr to non - local structural details .    the only properties that we found to display a significant correlation with the nmr shieldings were aluminium bader charges and born dynamical effective charges .",
    "for both charges the correlation is linear and structure independent as demostrated by the linear fits obeyed equally well by all phases , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlations ] .",
    "it should be mentioned that bader charges and born effective charges correlate very strongly with each other so that no additional information can be gained by considering the two charges together .",
    "this is because @xmath4-alumina is a crystal with a high degree of ionicity , where these two quantities are strongly related .",
    "furthemore , we can understand the correlation of nmr shieldings with born effective charges because they both originate from local electronic susceptibility , one being determined from the current induced by the magnetic field , the other measuring the charge flow associated to vibrational motion .    as an hystorical curiosity , we mention that proposing a correlation between nmr chemical shifts and effective charges is not a complete novelty since in a couple of papers@xcite in the late seventies a correlation",
    "was reported to exist for binary semiconductors among szigeti s effective charges and @xmath0 and @xmath83 nmr chemical shifts .",
    "we investigated from first principles the @xmath0 nmr properties of several well characterized crystalline phases of @xmath6 and of two of its calcination precursor phases , obtaining very good agreement with available experimental results .",
    "new insight for the peak assignments in the spectra were proposed for some structures .",
    "this gave confidence in the theoretical approach and allowed us to address the open problem of the structural characterization of the technologically important @xmath4-alumina phase by comparing the experimental spectra with the theoretical predictions calculated for four structural models recently appeared in the literature : our study supports the model structure with @xmath5 symmetry proposed by paglia  _ et  al .",
