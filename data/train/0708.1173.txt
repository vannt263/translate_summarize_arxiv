    "the heart cells that are directly involved in the dynamics of its electrical activity include pacemaker and non - pacemaker cells .",
    "the peacemaker cells generate spontaneous action potentials and are characterized by a slow rate of the depolarization .",
    "these cells are found in sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes of the heart and initiate the propagation of electrical activity throughout the heart .",
    "the non - pacemaker cells , involved in the propagation of electrical activity , such as atrial myocytes , ventricular myocytes and purkinje cells , have a specific form of action potential ( ap ) which is characterized by five main phases including a very rapid depolarization and a prolonged plateau  @xcite , see fig  [ fig - cell - ap ] .",
    "this paper proposes a simple computationally efficient model that can replicate these phases of ap .",
    "the non - pacemaker cell has a very negative resting potential ( phase 4 ) characterized by the open potassium channels and , therefore , k@xmath0 current and the closed fast sodium na@xmath0 and slow calcium channels ca@xmath1 .",
    "being depolarized to the threshold voltage of about -70mv the cell shows a very rapid depolarization caused by opening fast sodium channels na@xmath0 ( phase 0 ) .",
    "this phase quickly increases the membrane potential to positive values where the na@xmath0 channels become inactivated and the dynamics of the membrane changes to an initial repolarization ( phase 1 ) induced by a short - term transient outward k@xmath0 current .",
    "the plateau of cardiac action potential ( phase 2 ) is the result of balanced dynamics between inward ca@xmath1 current and the outward k@xmath0 current coming through the slow delayed rectifier potassium channels .",
    "a number of other ionic currents are also involved in this phase .",
    "as the ca@xmath1 channels start to close while the rectifier k@xmath0 channels remain open , the membrane potential drops to the levels of resting potential forming phase 3 .",
    "even from this , an overly simplified scenario involved in the formation cardiac action potential , it becomes clear that any attempt to produce a conductance based model of a non - pacemaker cell will lead to a large system of differential equations . a number of such models have been proposed and are used as accurate models of cardiac cells , see for example  @xcite    the simplified approaches to the modeling of cardiac ventricular action potentials include the sets of ode models where each ode equation phenomenologically represents the dynamics of multiple channels ( for example , van der pol equation  @xcite or the fitzhugh - negumo model  @xcite )",
    ". however , due to the high depolarizing rates of ap during phase 0 numerical simulations with the ode models require a significant reduction of the integration step size which complicates the use of these simple models in studies of large scale networks . here",
    "we suggest a model of the cardiac ap which is built using a discrete time map and designed to significantly increase the time step of simulations .",
    "a similar approach was successfully used before in the design of computationally efficient models of spiking - bursting  @xcite , regular spiking and fast and spiking neurons  @xcite , and other neurons .",
    "the simplest form of the suggested model is a two - dimensional map , which can be written as    @xmath2    where the dynamics of @xmath3 represents the fast changes related the phase 0 and the dynamics of @xmath4 forms the action potential during the remaining phases .",
    "the voltage of action potential @xmath5 will be defined at the end of this section as a liner combination of @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "the function @xmath6 in the right hand side of the first equation ( [ mapx ] ) can be written as @xmath7 where the nonlinear function @xmath8 is of the form  @xcite @xmath9 note , that for a description of autonomous dynamics of the model the conditions related to the values of @xmath10 can be omitted .",

    "the limit cycle of the map was used in  @xcite to replicate a sequence of short neuronal action potentials - a spike train .",
    "note , that the third condition of @xmath15 corresponds to the moment of time when @xmath3 reaches its maximum value , i.e. the tip of a spike .     and a limit cycle generated by subsystem ( [ mapx ] ) with @xmath17 and a fixed value of @xmath11=-2.55 ]    to replicate the action potential of a cardiac ventricular cell we shift @xmath15 down where the nonlinear segment intersects the diagonal giving birth to stable and unstable fixed points .",
    "this shift destroys the limit cycle shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "in addition to that we modulate the 1-d map with @xmath19 , where @xmath20 , see ( [ p ] ) .",
    "one can see from ( [ p ] ) that when @xmath19 approaches one the @xmath16 dependance of function @xmath6 flattens and approaches the values @xmath21 for all @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the increase of @xmath19 `` deactivates '' the motions of the 1-d map ( [ mapx ] ) by forming a superstable fixed point @xmath22 .",
