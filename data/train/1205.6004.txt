    "interfacing static and flying quantum degrees of freedom is a key step towards the realisation of operational quantum technologies .",
    "in fact , such a requirement figures as one of the additional ` networkability ' di vincenzo criteria , central to quantum communication , distributed computation and any sort of quantum networking @xcite . in current experimental set - ups , a promising approach to this problem",
    "consists in coupling a quantum degree of freedom with cavity light , and then to adopt the light leaking out of the cavity as the flying quantum degree of freedom @xcite .",
    "the latter may then be used to entangle distant trapped degrees of freedom by mixing on a beam - splitter @xcite or achieve entanglement in a local site by detection of the emerging light @xcite . from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "this paradigm is well described by the seminal input - output formalism developed in the eighties by yurke , collett and gardiner @xcite .    in this paper , we consider general confined bosonic degrees of freedom ( cavity light fields , trapped atoms , ions , optomechanical systems , or combinations thereof ) , adopt the input - output formalism to include interaction with a bath and a set of ( possibly ) accessible output modes , and develop a very general theoretical framework to study the correlations of the output fields .",
    "central to our analysis is the identification of suitable output modes , which are relevant to experimental detections in practical cases and will also lead us to the analytic determination of gaussian channels @xcite relating the initial correlations of the trapped system to the output correlations of the modes .",
    "if the initial state of the system is gaussian , which is often the case when one considers bilinear hamiltonians , the output fields will also be in a gaussian state and the complete characterisation of their state will hence be provided in such a case .",
    "let us emphasise that the standard input - output approach would imply the numerical solution of rather convoluted integrations .",
    "our treatment , instead , reduces the reconstruction of the output fields to an algebraic problem ( involving only the computation of matrix inverses , matrix exponentials and the solution of sylvester equations ) , which we completely characterise .",
    "furthermore , such a treatment is wholly independent from the details of the quadratic intra - cavity dynamics and extends , up to a quadratic scaling in the computational resources , to any number of modes , even into regimes where brute - force integration would be impractical .",
    "we then proceed to apply our theory to the relevant case of mechanical oscillators ( such as trapped ions , particles , or vibrating mirrors in opto - mechanical set - ups ) coupled to cavity light , and show that , given some initial degree of squeezing in the mechanical element , one can obtain squeezed travelling output light , or even distributed entanglement if one can access both output modes of a double - sided cavity .",
    "we also show how our formalism can provide a rigorous treatment of the continuous monitoring of mechanical motion , when performed via realistic ( non - instantaneous ) detectors and outside stationary regimes .",
    "we consider a localised system comprised of @xmath0 bosonic modes , whose canonical operators are grouped together in the column vector @xmath1 and subject to the most general affine quantum langevin equation : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ` drift matrix ' , determined by the system s own hamiltonian and linear coupling to the environment ( see below ) , and @xmath4 here , @xmath5 quantifies the loss rate of the @xmath6-th mode of the system , which interacts with the input operators @xmath7 and @xmath8 , while @xmath9 is just a constant vector , satisfying @xmath10 , accounting for the possible linear driving of the system . given a quadratic hamiltonian @xmath11 with @xmath12,@xmath13 , @xmath3 and @xmath14 can be expressed as : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the commutation matrix @xmath17 $ ] . throughout the paper",
    ", we shall only consider white gaussian input noise , characterised by @xmath18 and by the following correlation functions : @xmath19 where @xmath20 is related to a physical covariance matrix , as it obeys @xmath21 .",
    "the output field is determined by the boundary condition : @xmath22 where we deviate slightly from the standard definitions ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) to keep the formulae that will follow more compact .",
    "one can then insert the formal solution of eq .",
    "( [ langio ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ boundary ] ) to obtain @xmath23 note that , in general , not all the components of the output field @xmath24 will correspond to experimentally accessible modes . for example , the light leaking out of an optical cavity might be collected and further processed , while the ` quantum information ' that a mechanical mode dissipates into its phononic environment is lost for all practical purposes . in what follows",
    ", we shall assume that the accessible output fields do not suffer further losses before their experimental manipulation .",
    "however , as shown in [ two - sided ] , the treatment of the lossy case simply amounts to combining the gaussian channels described below with appropriate beam - splitter transformations .",
    "in many applications , one is interested in output modes characterized by an exponetial temporal profile ( see fig .",
    "[ figuraccia ] for an example ) . in general , this amounts to considering output modes of the form : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a @xmath27 diagonal matrix with @xmath28 , such that the mode profiles decay exponentially in time , with rates @xmath29 , and no mixing between the output modes is allowed .",
    "@xmath30 is a ( diagonal ) normalisation matrix which guarantees that the @xmath31 form a set of bosonic modes : @xmath32=\\sigma_{jk}$ ] .",

    "let us now extend our treatment to the case of detectors with a finite response time , and to spectral analysers with finite resolution . in both cases , assuming a lorentzian response in the frequency domain , the relevant output modes are of the form @xcite : @xmath52 where the diagonal matrix @xmath53 has the same form as above , and @xmath54^{-1/2}$ ] guarantees that the modes @xmath55 are bosonic .",

    "let us now apply our general formalism to instances of practical interest . we will deal with mechanical oscillators interacting with cavity fields and , typically , concern ourselves with regimes where the cavity field can be adiabatically eliminated , yielding a direct coupling of the mechanical degree of freedom to the input and output fields of the cavity @xcite . exploiting this mechanism",
    "has become a standard practice to achieve cavity cooling of a mechanical oscillator , and to perform continuous detections of fluctuations in the oscillator s position @xcite . here ,",

    "we are going to consider the possibility of high fidelity transfer of the quantum state of the motional degree of freedom , typically difficult to access , to a travelling pulse of light emitted by the cavity , which can be processed via standard optical tools ( this process is sometimes referred to as ` phonon - photon conversion ' ) .",
    "in particular , we shall focus on the transfer of squeezing between matter and light and on the creation of distributed gaussian entanglement between two output modes , given initial mechanical squeezing .",
    "in addition , we show how our formalism provides a rigorous and quantitative description of the continuous detection of the mechanical motion , performed via a realistic detector and in a manifestly non - stationary regime .",
    "we investigate in detail the case in which the oscillator is provided by the motion of a trapped ion , keeping in mind that very similar results hold for optomechanical systems [ in which case , eq .  ( [ coupling ] ) below can be taken as the starting point ] .",
    "coupled ion - cavity systems have been realized experimentally in @xcite , and cavity cooling of a trapped ion was proposed in @xcite .",

    "as we shall see shortly , we are only interested in inducing virtual transitions of the ion , which will remain in its internal ground state with good approximation .",
    "therefore , we only introduce a small error if we treat the mode @xmath73 as bosonic , which allows us to include the effects of spontaneous emission in the two - level system , all while remaining within the scope of our formalism and yielding an input - output gaussian channel . in all our studies ,",
    "we have simply verified a posteriori that the population of excited states above the first stays negligible at all times during the dynamics .",

    "if the ion is initially in its internal ground state , one obtains the hamiltonian @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "as anticipated , a hamiltonian of this form is also readily available in optomechanical set - ups , where it provides a reliable description of the dynamics under strong driving of the cavity field @xcite .    the direct coupling between the oscillator and the cavity input - output fields is finally obtained by choosing @xmath93 , and considering the limit @xmath94 .",

    "( [ langio2 ] ) describes red - sideband cooling of the mechanical mode , with cooling rate @xmath99 .",

    "while a useful guidance , the two relationships ( [ langio2 ] ) and ( [ boundary2 ] ) are only approximations , whose reliability does not extend to the full dynamics we will be interested to study .",

    "in particular , we shall focus here on the case in which the mode @xmath69 is initially in a pure squeezed state , and investigate quantitatively the amount of squeezing transferred to the travelling mode @xmath110 .",
    "the reliable realisation of such squeezing transfer constitutes a basic requirement for continuous variable quantum communication and information processing .",
    "moreover , in the medium term this set - up might be employed to generate squeezed light , with the crucial advantage of exploiting the stronger nonlinear terms allowed by material degrees of freedom with respect to light , where nonlinear interactions giving rise to squeezing are always comparatively weak .",
    "more specifically , the squeezing of trapped ions could be previously obtained either by manipulating the trapping potentials @xcite or through the internal degrees of freedom @xcite , while in optomechanical systems , an high degree of squeezing could be obtained via indirect position measurements @xcite .",
    "the squeezing of a gaussian state with cm @xmath120 has been quantified , in @xmath121 , as @xmath122 $ ] , where @xmath123 is the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath120 ( note that in our notation the vacuum state has eigenvalue @xmath124 ) . in the following example , we have considered a trapped indium ion , characterised by the experimental parameters shown in table  [ table ] ( see also [ experimental - parameters ] ) .",
    "our quantitative findings are summarised in fig .",
    "[ figura](a ) showing that , even though the state transfer is not accurate for the considered experimental parameters ( i.e. , the curve differs from a straight line of unit slope ) , a substantial amount of squeezing can be transferred from the trapped ion to the output travelling mode .",
    "however , the output squeezing seems to hit a plateau at about @xmath125db after an initial linear rise , indicating a complete breakdown of the approximated relation @xmath126 for high input squeezing .",
    "this is also reflected in the purity @xmath127 of the output state @xmath128 which , being our state gaussian , can be determined as @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "[ figura](b ) shows clearly that the purity of the output state is a decreasing function of the initial intra - cavity squeezing ( in db ) , proving that the conversion is not perfect since part of such squeezing is not coherently transferred but contributes instead to phase - insensitive noise in the output fields .      by considering , once again , output modes defined as in eq .",
    "( [ f ] ) , we can also study the leakage of both cavity mirrors in a double - sided cavity , for an initial squeezed state of the mechanical oscillator , and consider the state of the two output modes leaking out of each mirror .",
    "entanglement between those modes can be expected in this scenario , since the adiabatic elimination of the cavity field yields an effective coupling of the two output modes to the same motional degree of freedom .",
    "indeed , it can be shown that the formal treatment of this case is identical to that of a single - sided cavity , up to mixing its output field with the vacuum at a beam - splitter ( see [ two - sided ] ) .",
    "for the gaussian squeezed state of section [ squeeze - transfer ] , this operation results in entanglement between the two output modes , which can be quantified in terms of the logarithmic negativity @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "for a two - mode gaussian state with cm @xmath120 , the logarithmic negativity can be evaluated as @xmath131 $ ] , where @xmath132 is the smallest eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath133 , with @xmath134 ( @xmath135 being the @xmath136-pauli matrix ) .",
    "[ figura](c ) shows that a substantial amount of entanglement can be generated , and hence distributed , for realistic amounts of internal squeezing .",
    "our findings clearly point at the potential held by the motional degrees of freedom of massive particles as competitors of nonlinear crystals for the generation of optical entanglement .",
    "( [ boundary2 ] ) suggests that , by measuring the cavity output light with a fast detector , one should be able to monitor the mechanical motion in real time .",
    "in particular we shall focus here on the continuous detection of the mechanical population , keeping in mind that a similar analysis can be performed if one is interested in measuring the mechanical quadratures ( see [ adiabatic ] ) .",
    "we stress that here we are concerned with quantities averaged over many experimental runs , hence our treatment does not deal with the partial collapses of the quantum state that typically occur in a single realization of a continuous measurement @xcite .    to formulate the problem in terms of an input - output gaussian channel , we consider modes of the form ( [ g ] ) , with @xmath137 , @xmath138 being the bandwidth of the detector .",

    "( [ g ] ) and ( [ boundary2 ] ) , assuming that @xmath138 is large compared to the other frequencies in the problem , we get ( see [ adiabatic ] ) @xmath140 therefore , by rescaling the average intensity registered by the detector , one should be able to infer the average number of phonons in the oscillator at time @xmath141 .    using our general formalism",
    ", we can now investigate quantitatively the validity of this prediction . in fig .",
    "[ figura](d ) , we compare inferred and actual values of @xmath113 , as a function of time , for an indium ion with an initial motional squeezing of @xmath142 .",
    "it can be seen that , after an initial transient time , the rescaled intensity at the detector follows faithfully and monotonically the mechanical population .",
    "note however that the approximate relationship ( [ temp - estimate ] ) does not account for the detailed behaviour of the output field intensity , which is instead captured via our techniques .",
    "the current developments in the control of harmonic oscillators at the micro- , nano- and atomic scale and in the technologies to couple them to travelling electromagnetic degrees of freedom @xcite , as well as the wealth of applications quantum information theory has envisaged for such interfaces , call for compact and general frameworks to handle input - output processes in a variety of applied settings .",
    "this work responds to such a need by delivering an algebraic description , in terms of gaussian channels , of input - output relationships for general white noise and quadratic interactions .",
    "as demonstrated , the applicability of the method is broad while its predictions are directly observable , and we hence believe it to hold potential for further applications in the context of input - output quantum interfaces .",
