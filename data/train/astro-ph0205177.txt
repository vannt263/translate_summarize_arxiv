    "recently kinkhabwala and thorsett @xcite ( henceforth kt ) studied giant radio pulses from the fastest known millisecond pulsar to date , 1937 , simultaneously at frequencies 2380 mega hertz ( mhz ) , 1420 mhz and 430 mhz , using total intensity data from the arecibo radio telescope ( art ) ( see also sallmen & backer @xcite ; cognard et al .",
    "they used coherent dedispersion to obtain a time resolution of @xmath0 0.1 to 0.2 micro seconds ( @xmath2s ) .",
    "their main conclusions are ( 1 ) `` at each frequency , giant pulses are emitted only in narrow ( @xmath1 10 @xmath2s ) windows of pulse phase located @xmath0 55 - 70 @xmath2s after the main and interpulse peaks '' , ( 2 ) their `` ... mean arrival phase appears stable '' , ( 3 ) their cumulative intensity distribution is roughly power law with an exponent of @xmath4 .",
    "this article reports the result of analyzing seven giant pulses from 1937 , obtained at 326.5 mhz using ort ; only a single linear polarization was available , and incoherent dedispersion was used .",
    "although the data were observed with a sampling interval of 102.4 @xmath2s , the pulse phases of giant pulses were obtained with accuracies of 15 to 20 @xmath2s ; the instrument , the method of observation , and the several variations of data reduction for diverse purposes are given in vivekanand et al .",
    "@xcite , vivekanand @xcite , and vivekanand @xcite . while the above pulse phase accuracies are @xmath1 two orders of magnitude lower than those of kt , they are sufficient for the current purpose ; they are much smaller than the widths of giant pulses that are affected by interstellar scattering and dispersion broadening at 326.5 mhz ( discussed later ) .",
    "table 1 lists 5 of the total 7 data files observed during the later half of may 1995 , in which giant pulses were found . for technical reasons , the first 6000 of the 681984 samples ( each of duration 102.4 @xmath2s ) were ignored in each file .",
    "the data were folded at the corresponding period ( table 1 ) ; 15 times samples were synthesized in each period , whose duration differed from file to file , but is approximately 103.85 @xmath2s . in each file , consists of 44436 useful periods of data , the five highest peaks were found , and giant pulses were identified as those whose peak signal to noise ratio ( snr ) was higher than or close to 10.0 . then their pulse phases and their uncertainties were derived as in vivekanand @xcite .",
    "then the integrated profile of each file was cross correlated with that of file observed at ut 22:24:37 on 1995 - 05 - 22 ( no giant pulses were found in this file ) , and the data were shifted in each file ( using fft technique ) by the corresponding amount of time .    .",
    "columns 1 and 2 contain the date and time ( ut ) of observation ; column 3 contains the period ( in ms ) used for folding , derived from the tempo package ; column 4 contains the peak signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the giant pulse , while the last two columns contain the pulse phases of giant pulses and their errors ( in units of phase within the period ) . [ cols=\"^,^,^,>,>,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     1937 has a very small rotation period ; so it requires fast sampling rates that are not available at ort .",
    "it has a high dispersion measure ; so coherent dedispersion technique is required to maintain the required sensitivity ; that is also not available at ort . therefore observing this pulsar at ort",
    "is a difficult exercise , although ort is the most powerful telescope operating currently at @xmath0 327 mhz .",
    "the top panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows ten periods of 1937 centered around the strongest giant pulse observed at ort .",
    "the ordinate was obtained in units of the signal to noise ratio as described in vivekanand @xcite .",
    "the effects of dispersion smearing and interstellar scattering are evident in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "these data are too meager to verify the cumulative intensity distribution reported by kt of giant pulses of 1937 .",
    "so only a consistency check will be done here , using their 430 mhz observations .",
    "this frequency is appropriate for comparison with current ort observations since interstellar scattering of giant pulses affects their 430 mhz observations , just as it does the ort observations , but hardly their 1420 mhz or 2380 mhz observations .",
    "the effective collecting area of art is @xmath0 49700 square meters ( m@xmath5 ) , obtained from the antenna gain @xmath6 value of 18.0 kelvin per jansky ( k / jy ) quoted by thorsett & stinebring ( @xcite ) for observations of 1937 .",
    "that of ort is @xmath0 7400 ( m@xmath5 ) ; this is obtained from the @xmath7 ( k / jy ) ( selvanayagam et al @xcite ) for the correlation mode of operation of ort , and noting that the current observations have been done in the total power mode , which gains a factor @xmath8 .",
    "this reduces by factor @xmath0 6.7 the sensitivity of ort with respect to that of art .",
    "the system temperature of art is 170 k towards 1937 ( thorsett & stinebring @xcite ) ; that of ort is the receiver temperature plus spillover of 110 k ( selvanayagam et al @xcite ) plus the galactic background contribution of 202 k , obtained by scaling 117 k ( see equation 8 - 6 of manchester & taylor @xcite ) by the frequency scaling factor @xmath9 ( see salter & brown @xcite for the exponent 2.7 ) .",
    "this reduces ort s relative sensitivity by the further factor @xmath10 .",
    "the total available bandwidths at the two telescopes contribute a factor @xmath11 1.12 , while a factor @xmath8 arises due to the availability of only a single polarization at ort .    at 430 mhz ,",
    "kt look for giant pulses by integrating the flux density within a 150 @xmath2s window `` located on the tails of the main pulse ( mp ) and the interpulse ( ip ) '' ; in this work they are located by means of their peak snr , measured within a single time sample of duration 102.4 @xmath2s .",
    "further , interstellar scattering broadening of giant pulses in kt is @xmath0 30 @xmath2s at 430 mhz ( their table 1 ) , while interstellar dispersion smearing is negligible due to coherent dedispersion .",
    "thus at art the energy of giant pulses can be assumed to be effectively spread over the detection window width of @xmath12s . on the other hand , scatter broadening at ort is @xmath13 @xmath2s ( see manchester & taylor @xcite ) ; and dispersion smearing within each frequency channel is @xmath0 165 @xmath2s .",
    "now , scatter broadening occurs at each frequency within the observing bandwidth .",
    "thus at ort the energy of giant pulses can be expected to be spread over @xmath14 188 @xmath2s .",
    "thus the relative sensitivity of ort is reduced by @xmath15 due to smearing of giant pulse energy over a longer time , and by @xmath16 due to the reduced measurement window .",
    "ort s relative sensitivity is further affected by two uncertain factors .",
    "the first is a reduction by factor @xmath17 , due to refractive interstellar scintillation , phasing of ort , etc ; @xmath17 can be @xmath0 2 or even more at ort ( see vivekanand @xcite ) .",
    "the second is @xmath18 , due to the relative snr thresholds chosen in both works .",
    "the threshold is @xmath0 10 in this work ; i.e. , at ort one has observed @xmath19 giant pulses in @xmath20 minutes of observation above a snr threshold of @xmath21 . in kt",
    "this number is not explicitly stated . however , from their fig .",
    "7 one can deduce that a fraction of @xmath22 of their @xmath23 total periods ( kt mislabel these as `` pulses '' in the second last para of page 365 , which can be confused with the giant pulses ) have integrated fluxes greater than @xmath24}$ ] , at 430 mhz , within the @xmath25s window .",
    "the corresponding flux density threshold will be @xmath26 \\ } /\\",
    "150 \\mathrm{\\ [ } \\mu\\mathrm{s ] } \\approx   13\\mathrm{\\ [ jy]}$ ] .",
    "now , the noise of art within the @xmath25s window would be @xmath27\\ } /\\",
    "g \\mathrm{\\ [ k / jy]\\ } /\\ 2\\ /\\",
    "\\sqrt{10 \\mathrm{\\   [ mhz]\\ } \\times 150 \\mathrm{\\ [ } \\mu\\mathrm{s]\\ } } \\approx 0.12 $ ] jy ( the extra factor of 2 in the denominator arises due to the definition of the gain @xmath6 of an antenna ) .",
    "thus kt would have observed @xmath28 giant pulses above the snr threshold of @xmath29 ( kinkhabwala @xcite ) .",
    "thus the relative sensitivity of ort is enhanced by a factor @xmath30 due to the relative snr thresholds of both works .",
    "finally , the giant pulse flux density scales with observing frequency as @xmath31 ( kt ) ; this would further enhance the sensitivity of ort with respect to that of art by the factor @xmath32 2.35 .",
    "this leads to an effective sensitivity of ort that is a factor @xmath33 less than that of art .",
    "now , kt claim that the fraction of giant pulses above a flux density @xmath34 is proportional to @xmath35 ; actually the abscissa in their fig .  7 is intensity @xmath36 , which is @xmath34 multiplied by a fixed duration of time .",
    "so the number of giant pulses ort should have recorded in half an hour would be @xmath37 .",
    "therefore in the @xmath0 8.1 minutes of actual observation , ort is expected to record @xmath38 giant pulses .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "this is a factor @xmath40 higher than the number of giant pulses actually observed at ort ; @xmath17 needs to be @xmath41 for the numbers to match , which is not unreasonable at ort .",
    "furthermore , small changes in some of the above numbers can cause significant change in the final result .",
    "for example , assuming that the scatter broadening is 40 ( instead of 30 ) @xmath2s further reduces the number of giant pulses potentially observable by @xmath42% . as another example , if the giant pulse flux density is assumed to scale with observing frequency as @xmath43 , instead of as @xmath31 , since such a possibility exits in fig .",
    "10 of kt , the number of giant pulses potentially observable decreases by @xmath44% .",
    "it is therefore concluded that the seven giant pulses of 1937 observed in about 8.1 minutes of the current ort observations are consistent with the cumulative intensity distribution of kt .",
    "the effective time resolution of these data is so many times worse than that of kt that once again a detailed comparison is not possible with their work .",
    "however fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that there is broad agreement .",
    "= 8.25 cm    the mean pulse phase of the 6 giant pulses in the main pulse of the integrated profile of 1937 ( fig .  [ fig2 ] ) is 0.242@xmath450.006 , in units of the pulsar period ( @xmath0 1.55770 ms ) . for reference ,",
    "the phase of the peak of the main pulse in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is 0.247 ( discussed later ) .",
    "the error on the mean pulse phase is @xmath46s .",
    "this is obtained by taking into account ( 1 ) the formal estimation error on the phase of each giant pulse ( column 6 of table 1 ; see vivekanand @xcite for details ) , ( 2 ) the departure of the estimated phase of each giant pulse from the mean of all six values ( column 5 of table 1 ) , and ( 3 ) reducing by @xmath47 the final answer .",
    "assuming gaussian statistics one can conclude that most giant pulses ( in the main pulse of 1937 at 326.5 mhz ) arrive within a phase window of @xmath48s ; this is consistent with the narrow window of @xmath49 10 @xmath2s obtained by kt at higher radio frequencies .",
    "a corresponding comment can not be made regarding the giant pulses in the inter pulse of 1937 at 326.5 mhz , since these data contain only one such ; it occurs @xmath50s after the inter pulse peak .",
    "a visual inspection of fig .  [ fig2 ] shows that the arrival phases of giant pulses in the main pulse of 1937 at 326.5 mhz are `` stable '' as claimed by kt .",
    "once again this work can not comment on the stability of the arrival phases of giant pulses in the inter pulse .      the mean pulse phase of the peak of the main pulse of 1937 in fig .  [ fig2 ] , obtained by weighting the abscissa with the ordinate in the top panel , is 0.247 with ( comparatively ) negligible error .",
    "so it is separated from the mean pulse phase of giant pulses by @xmath51s , which is within measurement errors .",
    "this implies that the mean arrival phase of giant pulses is coincident with the mean pulse phase of the main component of the integrated profile of 1937 at 326.5 mhz .",
    "the separation of @xmath52s is independent of the scatter broadening at ort ; that is expected to bias both the mean pulse phase of a giant pulse ( modeled as a delta function convolved with a truncated exponential function ) , as well as the mean pulse phase of the main pulse of the integrated profile ( modeled as a gaussian convolved with a truncated exponential function ) , by the same amount , viz . , the scatter broadening width .",
    "this is inconsistent with the @xmath53s separation noted by kt .",
    "they mention that the separation has a `` lower limit of 49 @xmath2s at 430 mhz '' ; this also appears to be the case from a visual inspection of the bottom panel of their fig .  2 .",
    "therefore the best explanation currently is that ort observations , obtained using only a single linear polarization , might bias the mean pulse phase of the peak of the integrated profile to a greater extent than they do the mean pulse phases of giant pulses .",
    "this is plausible if , for example , the mean position angle of the linear polarization vector is different in the two cases ; or if it changes across the integrated profile at a rate that is different for the rate of change across the giant pulses , since the former is expected to be dominated by the non - giant pulse ( or the so called normal ) emission .",
    "however this result merits verification by future observations .",
    "this analysis is obviously not possible for the interpulse of 1937 in the current data .",
    "this work supports , at 326.5 mhz , the reported behavior of giant pulses of 1937 at higher radio frequencies ( kt ) , although with meager data .",
    "it is encouraging that this was possible with data having only a single linear polarization , and which also suffer from severe interstellar scattering .",
    "kt showed that timing the giant pulses of 1937 gives precision comparable to that obtained by timing the integrated profile , on the short time scales ( @xmath0 hours ) .",
    "whether this leads to better long term timing precision depends upon the emission characteristics of giant pulses  how fast does their average profile stabilize , etc .",
    "this problem can be studied with actual data , as is currently being undertaken by kt at the higher radio frequencies .",
    "unfortunately this can not be done at 326.5 mhz because of the technical limitations of ort .",
    "it would have been nice if one could theoretically study the problem ; but that would require more information on the intrinsic scatter of the giant pulse emission phase .",
    "i thank the referee for corrections and suggestions , and ali kinkhabwala for clarifications .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service ."
