    "the qualification implies that equation  [ hhpoteq2 ] has been obtained from classical considerations , while the concept of exchange is fundamentally quantum mechanical . a few comments on the situation may be pertinent at this stage .",
    "when two charge clouds interpenetrate , the normal classical picture is that they loose their individualities and form one composite charge cloud .",
    "but in the present treatment it has been tacitly assumed that the charge clouds could remember their past histories and retain their identities while sharing the same space .",
    "further , a pure classical cloud , like a ball of dough , can split in innumerable arbitrary fashions into a variety of components .",
    "but when the combining clouds maintain their identities even in the combined state , they split only in one way into their original components .",

    "the coulomb potential in equation  [ hhpoteq2 ] is long - ranged and the rest constitute a short - ranged interaction .",
    "the latter dominates over the former so long as there is significant overlap of the charge clouds of the particles .",
    "hence , its range is of the order of the charge radii of the interacting bodies .    if @xmath1 is so small compared to @xmath0 that it may be treated as a point particle , @xmath36 .",

    "] may be used for the interaction between the electron clouds of the atoms .",
    "equation   [ hhpoteq3 ] gives the interaction of the nucleus of one atom with the electron cloud of the other atom .",
    "the nuclei themselves interact through the coulomb potential .",
    "the resulting potential agrees with the morse potential@xcite",
    "it may be noted that @xmath8 is stronger for smaller particles . if the _ rms _ radii get reduced , @xmath37 ( equation [ v0eq ] ) gets proportionately enhanced .",
    "since the radius of a nucleon is smaller than that of an atom by a factor of @xmath38 , the potential , which is of the order of _ ev _ between atoms , becomes of the _ mev _ order between nucleons@xcite .",

    "[ potsfig ] ]    the charge distribution in proton is conventionally taken to be positive throughout its volume@xcite .",
    "this is incompatible with a potential which is strongly repulsive in one region and attractive in another .",
    "but that does not create any conceptual difficulty since potential and charge are considered to be dissociated from each other .",
    "the force between nucleons is known not to depend upon the charges carried by them .",
    "natural conclusion _ is that interaction between charges is not related to the strong force .",
    "but still one link remains .",
    "quark hamiltonian involves the potential and quark wavefunctions produce the charge densities .",
    "the two can not , therefore , be totally alienated .",
    "there lies an inconsistency .",
    "the question is whether the _ natural conclusion _ is the only possible conclusion . before searching for an answer to this question",
    ", a closer view of the all - positive distribution of charge in proton is necessary .",
    "a proton with + 1 unit of charge in the nucleus of a heavy atom can capture a k - shell electron carrying -1 unit of charge . the additional -1 unit does not nullify the charge distribution in the proton .",
    "neither should it modify the existing distribution to any great extent .",
    "it should primarily affect the distribution of charge in the peripheral region .",
    "otherwise , the reverse process , i.e. the spontaneous decay of a free neutron with a definite half - life , will be hard to conceive .",
    "an all - positive proton requires half of its total charge to change sign in order to turn itself into a neutron .",
    "this is provided by the charge of the captured electron .",
    "the -1/2 unit of charge has to reverse itself into + 1/2 unit in order to turn the neutron back into proton .",
    "it is enabled by emission of an electron . eithe way the process involves a 200% change for 50% of the total charge of proton .",
    "such a drastic reshuffling of the distribution of charge associated with the decay of a neutron under no external influence or transfer of energy is rather unrealistic .",
    "a proton will be able to accommodate an electron only if its addition does not seriously disturb the original charge distribution of the proton .",
    "the electron charge should , therefore , remain confined beyond the charge volume of a proton.a neutron should , therefore , appear to have one positively charged sphere of one unit embedded in a negatively charged shell also of one unit . such a structure has not been substantiated independently .    since n - p and p - p potentials are nearly the same , the quark wavefunctions in neutron and proton may be expected to be similar in nature .",
    "two greatly different charge distributions in them are inconsistent .",
    "an _ ab initio _ calculation of charge densities in proton and neutron requires determination of quark wavefunctions in them . in absence of a dominating central potential ,",
    "it calls for self - consistent solutions of schrdinger equations .",
    "the project has not been undertaken at present .",
    "another problem is that the all - positive charge distribution in proton fails to account for _ back - scattering _ of electrons .",
    "the presence of a negative core in proton would have eased the problem .    an alternate outlook may be considered .",
    "it may be accepted that an interaction between overlapping charges produces strong force as per the presentation made hereinbefore .",
    "a negative core may be added to a magnified positive outer distribution in a proton to produce a net charge of + 1 unit .",
    "the two charge components may individually be much larger than 1 unit , so that the gain or loss of one -1 unit does not affect the overall charge distributions severely .",
    "one can then expect the _ rms _ charge radii of proton and neutron to be not much different .",
    "nuclear force may then appear to be _",
    "charge independent_. the present model could provide an alternative to the _ natural conclusion _",
    "mentioned before .",
    "such interplay of large quantities of charges is not unknown .",
    "all atoms are electrically neutral when observed from a distance , while closer scrutiny of heavy atoms reveals large amounts of positive and negative charges in co - existence .",
    "the charge distribution in a proton as considered here has a negative core of 32 units surrounded by an outer positive cloud of 33 units .     for proton and neutron in arbitrary units as a function of r in units of _ fm _ with @xmath48 = 0.005 & @xmath47 = 0.8 .",
    "[ chargefig ] ]    the neutron core carries the same charge as the proton core , but its outer cloud has only + 32 units of charge .",
    "the radial charge densities are shown in figure  [ chargefig ] .",
    "the difference is only 1 unit out of 32 units in the outer charge cloud .",
    "it amounts to a 3% change , which is well within acceptable limits .",
    "such a small change does not put up an objection to a qualitative statement .",
    "various internucleonic potentials are plotted in figure  [ potsfig ] , which again bear close resemblance .",
    "they confirm the expectations mentioned before that the _ rms _ charge radii of proton and neutron are nearly equal and that nuclear force is _",
    "charge independent_.    it needs be mentioned that the numbers cited above are not sacrosanct .",
    "they were chosen in order to demonstrate that a suitable quark charge density distribution can produce a potential between two protons in agreement with experimental findings .",
    "quark wavefunctions obtained _ ab initio _ may confirm or modify the present choice of the parameters .",
    "two terms in equation  [ ppchargeeq ] is the minimum requirement and is adequate for the present purpose .",
    "a broader basis set may offer better representation of quark charge densities in nucleons .",
    "but the basic contention of the present analysis remains unchanged .",
    "the negative core may also be investigated by positron scattering from protons .",
    "such experiments would require positron beams of sufficient intensity with adequate energy to ride over or tunnel through a potential hill before they reach the core .",
    "observed from the centre - of - mass , two protons colliding with relativistic energies appear to undergo contractions along their line of approach .",
    "they get flattened out(figure  [ collfig ] ) .",
    "the shape of such a proton may be approximated by a ring with a ball just fitting into its hole .",
    "its mass and charge are now shared between the ring and the ball .    ]    with increasing energy , it seems that the proton is further squeezed .",
    "the ring gets flatter and wider so as to reduce the size of the hole while preserving its outer diameter .",
    "the ball now closing the hole is smaller .",
    "the total volume of the proton gets reduced .",
    "naturally the mass and the charge distributions get denser and their partitioning between the two components vary .",
    "however , since the charge density in a proton tails off rapidly , the ring carries very little charge .    in the following qualitative analysis the ring",
    "is ignored .",
    "the modified scenerio is that with increasing energy a spherical proton remains spherical but gets smaller .",
    "the densities of mass and charge increase .",
    "the proton thus gets more and more compact . @xmath49 and @xmath50 in figure  [ r2rhofig ]",
    "show the radial charge densities at @xmath51 and @xmath52 reductions of the _ rms _ radii respectively .",
    "compared to the unreduced density @xmath53 they are laterally contracted and vertically elongated .     in arbitrary units as a function of r in units of _",
    "fm_. for @xmath53 ,   @xmath48 = 0.005 & @xmath47 = 0.8 . for @xmath49",
    "these have the values 0.004 & 0.64 respectively and for @xmath50 these values are 0.003 & 0.48 . [ r2rhofig ] ]    corresponding @xmath54 interaction potentials @xmath55 and @xmath56 are plotted along with @xmath57 , the non - relativistic potential , in figure  [ potfig ] .     @xmath48 = 0.005 & @xmath47 = 0.8 . for @xmath55",
    "these have the values 0.004 & 0.64 respectively and for @xmath56 these values are 0.003 & 0.48 . [ potfig ] ]    they also display similar deformations .",
    "the process continues with decreasing size of the proton associated with increasing energy .",
    "the peak of the potential is attained at @xmath33 .",
    "it is about @xmath58 for a proton at rest or with non - relativistic energy .",
    "since the interaction between two reducing spheres goes on changing , the data collected from scattering experiments performed at different relativistic energies can not be correlated unless the change of potential with energy is taken into consideration .",
    "with increasing energy of collision the participants become more massive , very compact and extremely hard .",
    "their fundamental ingredients are glued together more strongly .",
    "they are reluctant to leave their progressively reducing confines .",
    "consequently , the colliding particles strongly resist disintegration under direct impact .",
    "relativistic effects are comparatively less pronounced for a heavy nucleus carrying higher momentum with lower velocity .",
    "collision between them may result in splintering into their constituent particles rather than totally disintegrating into their basic elements",

    "the centre - of - mass such a proton appears stationary .",
    "it is _ ` soft'_. the high speed nuclei are hard hitters .",
    "some of the soft protons may get caught between them and be smashed .",
    "if proton beams are used , the probability of a head - on collision gets reduced",
    ". a nucleus with mass number @xmath59 has a cross - section @xmath60 times that of a proton .",
    "the probability of two such nuclei colliding is @xmath61 times that of two protons",
    ".    the soft protons injected into the collision chamber must neither be too dense nor too thin . in a thick cloud",
    "most of the beam protons will hit plasma protons in 2-body collisions . from the centre - of - mass",
    "both will appear to be moving at half the beam proton s speed .",
    "it will result in a collision between two hard protons . on the other hand ,",
    "if the plasma is too thin , the colliding protons will find it difficult to get a soft proton in - between them .",
    "slower protons are preferable .",
    "they spend more time in the collision chamber and have better opportunities of capturing soft protons .",
    "but they must be energetic enough to smash the captive ones . even then",
    ", 3-body events may occur infrequently and a successful experiment will require sensitive detector systems .",
    "the ultimate result of a collision experiment depends upon the answer to yet another question that still persists : _ ` what happens when a soft proton is smashed ? '",
