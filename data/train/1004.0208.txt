    "alignment @xcite describes a set of techniques that allows communication in @xmath0-user networks at significantly enhanced rates compared to standard ` resource division ' schemes such as tdma .",
    "interference alignment schemes use the channel so that for each receiver all the interference lies in one subspace and the signal lies in another .    the schemes of cadambe and jafar @xcite and of maddah - ali , motahari and khandani @xcite apply a channel model divided into time or frequency sub - channels , and involve the inversion and multiplication of large matrices .",
    "( these schemes have been implemented by el ayach , peters and heath @xcite in the case of @xmath7 , and in both indoor and outdoor environments provide performance close to the degrees of freedom results predicted by theory . )    given a fast - fading channel  that is a channel with independent and identically distributed ( iid ) fading coefficients in each time slot  nazer , gastpar , jafar and vishwanath @xcite proposed an alternative scheme , which we call the ngjv  scheme . in brief , the ngjv  scheme pairs communications using fading matrix @xmath8 with those using fading matrix @xmath9 , together providing a situation with no interference between receivers . using previous results by nazer and gastpar concerning the reconstruction of linear combinations of signals @xcite ,",
    "the authors provide a description of an achievable rate region .",
    "( we outline the ngjv scheme in more detail in section iii . )    using ideas of ` bottleneck states ' , jafar @xcite showed that the rate region found by nazer et al .",
    "@xcite gives a sharp bound on sum - capacities in an idealized model where all @xmath10s are identical , and @xmath11s are iid .",
    "the present authors @xcite showed that such bounds on sum - capacity also hold when nodes are positioned at random in a fixed region of space , in a model similar to that used by zgur , lvque and tse @xcite .",
    "these arguments show that the performance of the ngjv  scheme can be regarded as optimal , since in a @xmath0-user interference network , half the single - user rate is achievable for each user , no matter how large @xmath0 is .",
    "that is ` each user can get half the cake ' .",
    "however , this is achieved at the cost of a significant delay in communications .    for definiteness",
    ", we consider a model of communication over a finite field @xmath12 of size @xmath2 . since the ngjv scheme @xcite requires a particular @xmath13 channel matrix with entries in @xmath14 to occur , the expected delay for a particular message is @xmath15 ( which is roughly @xmath1 for large @xmath2 ) .",
    "it is clear that even for @xmath0 and @xmath2 relatively small , this is not a practical delay .",
    "( for @xmath16 and @xmath17 , for example , the delay is @xmath18 . )",
    "there are five questions we would like to try to answer :    1 .",
    "can we find a scheme that , like ngjv , achieves half the single - user rate , but at a lower time delay ? 2 .",
    "can we find schemes that have lower time delays than ngjv , even at some cost to the rate achieved ?",
    "3 .   specifically , which schemes from question 2 perform well for situations where we have few users ( @xmath0 small ) ? 4 .",
    "specifically , which schemes from question 2 perform well for situations where we have many users ( @xmath19 ) ? 5 .   what is a lower bound on the best time delay possible for any scheme achieving a given rate for a given number of users ?    in sections",
    "[ sec : schemes ] and v , we define a new set of schemes , called jap ( subsection iv - b ) , a beamforming extension jap - b ( subsection iv - d ) , and child schemes derived from them ( section v ) that have lower time delays than the ngjv scheme , for a variety of different rates , answering question 2 . as a special case , examined in subsection iv - e , the @xmath20)$ ]",
    "schemes achieve half the single - user rate , like ngjv , whilst reducing the time delay from @xmath1 to @xmath21 , answering question 1 . in section",
    "vi , we answer questions 3 and 4 , by finding and analysing the jap schemes that perform the best for small and large @xmath0 ; table 1 and figure 1 illustrate the best schemes for small @xmath0 , and theorems 6 and 7 give the asymptotic behaviour of the schemes .",
    "question 5 remains an open problem ( although we do give a lower bound on the delay achievable for the schemes listed above ) .",
    "koo , wu and gill @xcite have previously attempted to answer questions 2 and 3 .",
    "we briefly outline their work at the end of section iii .",
    "since ergodic interference alignment relies on matrices being exactly aligned , nazer et al @xcite give their main results in the context of the finite field channel , where there are only finitely - many possible fading matrices .",
    "( they then use a quantisation argument to apply their results to the gaussian case . ) in order to allow comparison of our results , we use the same finite field model .    for a block length @xmath22 , each source @xmath23 independently produces a message @xmath24 belonging to the set @xmath25 for rate @xmath26 .",
    "each transmitter @xmath23 separately ( without knowledge of the other messages ) encodes the message @xmath24 as a codeword @xmath27,\\dots , x_i[n])$ ] .    at time @xmath28 , receiver @xmath29 sees channel output @xmath30 = \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t ] x_i[t ] + z_j[t],\\ ] ] and needs to decode the message @xmath31 .",
    "we can rewrite this equation in matrix form as @xmath32 = { \\mathsf{h}}[t ] { { \\mathbf { x}}}[t ] + { { \\mathbf { z}}}[t ] , \\ ] ] where we call @xmath8 the _ channel matrix _ or _ fading matrix_. here , as in @xcite , the noise terms @xmath33 $ ] are iid sequences from a distribution on @xmath34 .",
    "( nazer et al @xcite demand that the noise terms are is a mixture of a uniform distribution and a point mass at zero  that is with @xmath35 but do not appear to use this hypothesis . )    like nazer et al @xcite , we use an ` ergodic ' model , where the channel coefficients @xmath36 $ ] are drawn iid and uniformly from the field @xmath14 and are redrawn for each time slot .",
    "we assume all transmitters and receivers have full causal channel state information for all transmitter ",
    "receiver pairs .    by a simple mutual information maximisation , it is easy to show that the the capacity of the single - user finite field channel @xmath37 ( for @xmath38 ) is @xmath39 .",
    "we refer to this quantity @xmath39 as @xmath40 , since it is the relative entropy @xmath41 for @xmath42 uniform on @xmath12 .",
    "it will turn out that schemes for the finite field interference channel often allow each user pair to achieve a fixed fraction of the single - user rate .",
    "we refer to the ` pre-@xmath40 term ' as the _ degrees of freedom_.    given an achievable symmetric rate point @xmath43 , we define the _ degrees of freedom _ to be @xmath44 .    in particular , it s clear that a single user can achieve @xmath45 degree of freedom .",
    "the description of the ngjv  scheme @xcite is based on two ideas .",
    "the first idea , from the previous work of nazer and gastpar @xcite , involves the performance of finite - field multiple - access channels .",
    "each receiver s problem takes the form @xmath46 = \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{i } x_i[t ] + z[t]\\ ] ] giving a multiple - access channel with fixed coefficients @xmath47 . rather than reconstructing a single message @xmath31 or all messages @xmath48 ",
    "as the receiver would normally wish to do  it can be shown ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma 3 ) that the receiver can actually recover the ` pseudomessage ' @xmath49 at the rate @xmath50 .",
    "( this is done by all transmitters using the same linear code , so for all @xmath23 , @xmath51 , \\dots , x_i[n ] ) = { \\mathsf{g } } { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i$ ] , for an appropriate @xmath52 generator matrix @xmath53 . )",
    "the second idea is that of a typical set of channel matrices : essentially , in a long enough sequence of channel matrices , each possible matrix @xmath54 should occur an approximately equal number of times .",
    "this means that transmissions using a particular matrix @xmath8 can be paired with its complement @xmath55 , since both occur a roughly equal number of times .",
    "( we do not discuss the typicality here , since we simply work in terms of the delay of a single transmission . )",
    "the ngjv  scheme works as follows .",
    "each transmitter @xmath23 sends two signals encoding the same message @xmath24 ; first when the channel matrix is @xmath8 and second when the channel matrix is @xmath56 . in the first time period",
    ", each receiver @xmath29 can reliably estimate the pseudomessage @xmath57 , using the argument above .",
    "the receiver stores this pseudomessage in its memory . in the second period they can reliably estimate the pseudomessage @xmath58 , which it also stores in its memory .",
    "the receiver then adds together these two estimates of pseudomessages , recovering @xmath59 since both estimates can be made arbitrarily accurate by transmitting at a rate @xmath60 , we conclude that each transmitter can send a message to its receiver at rate @xmath61 ( since two channel uses are needed per message ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath62 .",
    "( observe that the receiver needs to perform two separate estimates , and can not simply add the channel outputs together . to do this would lead to a channel of the form @xmath63 , where @xmath64 denotes convolution .",
    "the overall rate in this case is @xmath65 , with strict inequality unless @xmath66 or @xmath67 is always @xmath68 , and the @xmath69-fold convolution has relative entropy @xmath70 which ` usually ' decreases exponentially in @xmath69 @xcite . )    we define the expected time delay for the ngjv scheme to be the average number of time slots we must wait after seeing a channel matrix @xmath8 until we see the corresponding matrix @xmath55 . the time delay is geometrically distributed with parameter @xmath71 , where @xmath71 is the probability that the random channel matrix takes the value @xmath9 .",
    "the mean of this random variable is @xmath72 ; hence the problem of finding the average time delay is reduced to a problem of finding the probability that a desired matrix appears in the next time slot .",
    "since a channel matrix has @xmath3 entries , each of which needs to take the correct one value of @xmath73 possible values , the average time delay is @xmath74 ( here and elsewhere , we write @xmath75 if @xmath76 as @xmath77 . )    as we mentioned before , this expected delay will be quite large even for modest values of @xmath2 and @xmath0 . for this reason , we will concentrate on the delay exponent .    an interference alignment scheme with expected delay @xmath78 for some @xmath79 and",
    "@xmath80 has _",
    "delay exponent _ @xmath80 and _ delay constant _ @xmath79 .",
    "we regard reduction of the delay exponent as the key aim , with the delay coefficient playing a secondary role .",
    "in particular , the finite field model is in some sense an abstraction of the model where channel coefficients are gaussians quantized into a set of size @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is chosen chosen large enough to reduce quantization error .",
    "when @xmath2 is large , the delay exponent @xmath80 dominates the delay constant @xmath79 in determining size of the expected delay @xmath81 .",
    "to summarize , the ngjv schemes achieve @xmath82 for a delay exponent of @xmath3 .    for comparison , time - division multiple access ( tdma ) , where each transmitter ",
    "receiver pair has sole access to the channel for an @xmath0th of the total time , achieves @xmath83 for a expected delay @xmath84 , and hence a delay exponent of @xmath85 .",
    "to an extent , our new schemes can be seen as ` interpolating ' between the extremes of ngjv ( high rate , high delay ) and tdma ( low rate , low delay ) .",
    "we also mention some new schemes outlined in a recent paper by koo , wu and gill @xcite .",
    "they attempted to answer our questions 2 and 3 , by finding schemes  we call them kwg schemes  with lower delay than the ngjv scheme .",
    "the kwg schemes suggest matching a larger class of matrices than simply @xmath8 and @xmath9 . by analysing the hitting probability of an associated markov chain",
    ", they were able to reduce the expected delay , at the cost of a reduction in rate ( and hence degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , their schemes only affect the delay by a constant multiple , with the most successful scheme @xcite only reducing the delay to @xmath86 .",
    "that is , the kwg schemes only reduce the delay constant @xmath79 , leaving the delay exponent as @xmath87 . for modest @xmath2 and @xmath0 ( say @xmath17 , @xmath16 , again ) , we regard this delay as still impractical .",
    "since the kwg schemes achieve a lower rate than the ngjv scheme for the same delay exponent , we shall only compare our results with the ngjv scheme .",
    "in the ngjv scheme , all receivers were able to decode their message by summing their two pseudomessages @xmath88 { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t_1 ] { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i = { { \\mathbf { w}}}_j \\quad \\text{for $ j=1,\\dots , n$.}\\ ] ] in other words , the ngjv scheme relies on the linear dependence @xmath89 + { \\mathsf{h}}[t_1 ] = { \\mathsf{i } } .\\ ] ]    this scheme has a large delay , because , given @xmath90 $ ] , there is only one matrix , @xmath91 = { \\mathsf{i } } - { \\mathsf{h}}[t_0]$ ] , that can complete the linear dependence . if there were a large collection of matrices that could complete the dependence , then the delay would be lower .",
    "we make three observations to this end .",
    "first , whilst ngjv matches two channel states @xmath90 $ ] and @xmath91 $ ] to form this linear dependence , we could use more than two .",
    "that is , if we have @xmath92 channel matrices @xmath90 , { \\mathsf{h}}[t_1 ] , \\dots , { \\mathsf{h}}[t_k]$ ] such that @xmath89 + { \\mathsf{h}}[t_1 ] + \\cdots + { \\mathsf{h}}[t_k ] = { \\mathsf{i } } , \\ ] ] than receivers @xmath29 can sum the @xmath92 pseudomessages to recover their message , @xmath88 { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t_1 ] { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i + \\cdots + \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t_k ] { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i = { { \\mathbf { w}}}_j .\\ ] ] note that the transmission of a single message is now split among @xmath92 channel states , rather than @xmath93 as in ngjv .",
    "this means that the degrees of freedom of this scheme is reduced to @xmath94 from ngjv s @xmath95 .",
    "second , any linear combination of channel state matrices that sums to @xmath96 is sufficient .",
    "that is , if there exist scalars @xmath97 such that @xmath98 + \\lambda_1 { \\mathsf{h}}[t_1 ] = { \\mathsf{i } } , \\ ] ] then all receivers can recover their message by forming the linear combination of pseudocodewords @xmath99 { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i + \\lambda_1 \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t_1 ] { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i = { { \\mathbf { w}}}_j \\quad \\text{for $ j=1,\\dots , n$.}\\ ] ]    third , ngjv requires all users to be able to decode their messages at the same time .",
    "however , receiver @xmath29 can decode its message if @xmath88 { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i + \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t_1 ] { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i = { { \\mathbf { w}}}_j\\ ] ] regardless of whether this equality holds for other receivers as well . in other words , receiver @xmath29 can decode its message if @xmath100 + h_{jj}[t_1 ] & = 1   \\\\      h_{ji}[t_0 ] + h_{ji}[t_1 ] & = 0 \\quad \\text{for $ i\\neq j$}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] putting these three observations together , we get the following : let @xmath90 , { \\mathsf{h}}[t_1 ] , \\dots , { \\mathsf{h}}[t_k]$ ] be a sequence of @xmath92 channel state matrices . if there exist scalars @xmath101 such that for some @xmath29 @xmath102 + \\lambda_1 h_{jj}[t_1 ] + \\cdots + \\lambda_k h_{jj}[t_k ] & = 1   \\\\      \\lambda_0 h_{ji}[t_0 ] + \\lambda_1 h_{ji}[t_1 ] + \\cdots + \\lambda_k h_{ji}[t_k ] & = 0 \\quad \\text{$i\\neq j$ } ,    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then receiver @xmath29 can recover its message by forming the linear combination of pseudocodewords @xmath99 { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i + \\cdots + \\lambda_k \\sum_{i=1}^n h_{ji}[t_k ] { { \\mathbf { w}}}_i = { { \\mathbf { w}}}_j .\\ ] ]    in fact , we only require @xmath102 + \\lambda_1 h_{jj}[t_1 ] + \\cdots + \\lambda_k h_{jj}[t_k ] & \\neq 0   \\\\      \\lambda_0 h_{ji}[t_0 ] + \\lambda_1 h_{ji}[t_1 ] + \\cdots + \\lambda_k h_{ji}[t_k ] & = 0 \\quad \\text{for $ i\\neq j$}.    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the coefficients @xmath103 can be rescaled to make the top equation ( 4 ) equal to @xmath45 without breaking the bottom equation ( 5 ) .    or , writing @xmath104 for the interference vector @xmath105 we can again rewrite the requirement as @xmath102 + \\lambda_1 h_{jj}[t_1 ] + \\cdots + \\lambda_k h_{jj}[t_k ] & \\neq 0   \\label{one } \\\\",

    "\\label{two }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    if @xmath0 equalities like the and above hold , we say that `` receiver @xmath29 can recover its message from @xmath106 , @xmath91 , \\dots,$ ] @xmath107 $ ] . ''",
    "the time delay of this scheme is @xmath108 .",
    "recall that the average delay is the reciprocal of the probability that a random matrix allows a receiver to recover its message .",
    "thus it will be useful to note the following lemma .",
    "conditional on the interference vectors @xmath109,\\dots , { { \\mathbf { h}}}_j^{\\text{int}}[t_k]$ ] being linearly dependent , the probability that receiver @xmath29 can recover its message is @xmath110 .",

    "so is the sum of @xmath118 random variables @xmath119 iid uniform on @xmath116 .",
    "we can wrote the mass function of each @xmath119 as @xmath120 , where @xmath42 is uniform on @xmath121 , @xmath122 is a point mass on @xmath68 and @xmath123 .",
    "then the mass function of the @xmath118-fold convolution is @xmath124 hence , the probability that is zero is @xmath125 the result follows .",
    "we now present our new scheme .",
    "the idea behind the scheme is as follows : we start be seeing some channel state @xmath90 $ ] .",
    "we then set @xmath127 to be the first time slot that allows receivers @xmath45 to @xmath128 to recover their message ( where @xmath128 is decided on in advance ) .",

    "such a child scheme clearly has the same delay exponent as the parent scheme , with the rate  and thus the degrees of freedom  reduced by a factor of @xmath188 .",
    "so an @xmath183-user jap - b scheme shared between @xmath0 users gives @xmath189 .",
