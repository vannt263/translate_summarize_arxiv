    "<S> self - organized quasi periodicity is one of the most puzzling dynamical phases observed in systems of non linear coupled oscillators . </S>",
    "<S> the single dynamical units are not locked to the periodic mean field they produce , but they still feature a coherent behavior , through an unexplained complex form of correlation . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a class of leaky integrate - and - fire oscillators on random sparse and massive networks with dynamical synapses , featuring self - organized quasi periodicity , and we show how complex collective oscillations arise from constructive interference of microscopic dynamics . in particular , we find a simple quantitative relationship between two relevant microscopic dynamical time scales and the macroscopic time scale of the global signal . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the proposed relation is a general property of collective oscillations , common to all the partially synchronous dynamical phases analyzed . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that an analogous mechanism could be at the origin of similar network dynamics . </S>"
