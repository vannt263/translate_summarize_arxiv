    "a quantum system inevitably couples to the environmental degree of freedom , which forms an open quantum system  @xcite .",
    "it is of great significance to understand the influence of environment on the quantum system . as a paradigmatic model to study the open quantum systems ,",
    "the spin - boson model has drawn persistent attentions  @xcite . in the spin - boson model ,",
    "the quantum system is simplified as a single spin ( qubit ) , while the environment is abstracted into a bosonic bath with an infinite number of modes .",
    "the coupling between the qubit and the environment is characterized by a spectral function @xmath3 which is proportional to @xmath4 .",
    "the spectral exponent @xmath5 varies the spin - boson model into three different types : sub - ohmic ( @xmath6 ) , ohmic ( @xmath7 ) , and super - ohmic ( @xmath8 ) .    despite its simple form ,",
    "there still exist great challenges to analyze the spin - boson model , due to the continuous bosonic bath which leads to an infinite number of degree of freedoms .",
    "the difficulties are aggravated by the infrared divergence of the sub - ohmic and ohmic spin - boson model which has close relations with the quantum phase transition ( qpt )  @xcite .",
    "many advanced numerical approaches have been applied to this model , such as the numerical renormalization group ( nrg )  @xcite , quantum monte carlo simulation ( qmc )  @xcite , sparse polynomial space approach  @xcite , exact diagonalization in terms of shift boson   @xcite , and variational matrix product state method  @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that there exists a second - order qpt for sub - ohmic baths and the kosterlitz - thouless qpt for the ohmic bath .",
    "it has been argued for a long time that the qpt of the present quantum model is in the same universality class as the thermodynamic phase transition of the one - dimensional ising model with long - range interactions @xcite .",
    "this quantum - to - classical correspondence was supported by most numerical approaches , but also questioned by a berry phase term emerged in the action  @xcite .",
    "most recently , we have developed a displaced fock state ( dfs ) method @xcite to analytically study the sub - ohmic spin - boson model and present evidence of the gaussian criticality persistent in the whole sub - ohmic bath regime .",
    "the variational study based on the polaronic unitary transformation by silbey and harris  @xcite has inspired a lot of studies by means of coherent states and various extensions @xcite .",
    "zheng  _ et al .",
    "_ reproduced the results of silbey - harris ansatz by unitary transformation without variational procedures . the zeroth - order approximation in dfs method @xcite",
    "can also recover the famous silbey - harris results .",
    "a generalized silbey - harris ansatz was proposed by chin  _ et al . _ which correctly describes a continuous transition with mean - field exponents for @xmath9   @xcite .",
    "however , it failed to give reliable critical points for @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "recently , the single coherent states ansatz  @xcite was improved by simply adding other coherent states on the equal footing  @xcite and by superpositions of two degenerate single coherent states  @xcite , which are generally termed as multi - coherent - states ( mcs ) ansatz in this paper .",
    "actually , the mcs in the single - mode version has been proposed ten years before by ren _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite independently .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite have studied the novel environmental entanglement and spin coherence in the ohmic spin - boson model  by increasing the number of the coherent states without much more difficulties . very interestingly , the mcs ansatz was shown to have fast convergence and can give results with very high accuracy .",
    "the variational study using mcs with unconstrained parameters have not been studied in the spin - boson model , which may hopefully shed light on the quantum criticality of the spin - boson model .    among all single coherent ansatz , any correlations among bosons",
    "are not included , so in principle the non - mean  field exponent can not be given . while the correlations among phonons should be certainly embodied in the mcs ansatz .",
    "recently , diagrammatic multiscale methods anchored around local approximations , where the particle correlations are self - consistently taken into account , indeed capture the well known non - mean - field nature of a lattice model  @xcite .",
    "so it is expected that mcs would give the precise description for the quantum criticality also , which motivate the present study for the qpt in both sub - ohmic and ohmic spin - boson model within the mcs ansatz without imposing any limits on the variational parameters .",
    "the rest of paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the spin - boson hamiltonian is introduced briefly .",
    "the asymmetrical mcs ansatz is proposed in sec .",
    "iii , and the self - consistent equations for the variational parameters are derived .",
    "the numerical results for the order parameter and the entanglement entropy are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iv , and conclusions are given in the last section .",
    "the spin - boson hamiltonian can be written as @xmath11 where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the pauli matrices , @xmath14 is the tunneling amplitude between the spin - up state @xmath15 and the spin - down state @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) is the bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator which can ( create ) a boson with frequency @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the corresponding coupling strength between the qubit and the bosonic bath , which is determined by the spectral density @xmath3 , @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a dimensionless coupling constant , @xmath23 is the cutoff frequency which is set to be @xmath24 throughout this paper , @xmath25 is a step function .",
    "the ground - state in the generalized silbey - harris ansatz  @xcite can be written in the bases of spin - up state @xmath15 and spin - down state @xmath16 as @xmath26    b\\exp \\left [ \\sum_{k=1}^{n_b}g_k\\left ( b_k^{\\dag } -b_k\\right ) \\right ]    \\end{array } \\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath27  ( @xmath28 ) is related to the occupation probabilities of spin - up ( spin - down ) state , while @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) are the corresponding bosonic displacements of the @xmath31th mode .",
    "it can be reduced to the original silbey - harris ansatz if set @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "note that the nonlocal correlations among phonons are not included in this ansatz , so non - mean - field nature can not be described in this ansatz . in the recent analytic dfs method",
    "@xcite , correlations for more than one phonon can be fully considered step by step .",
    "this is a very clean and rigourous approach where the correlations among phonons are explicitly shown .",
    "however , even the nearly converged results for the magnetic order parameter up to the third - order dfs still can not give the non - mean - field nature for @xmath34 . note that in the dfs , the number of the parameters for the self - consistent solutions , which are required in the discretization in the continuous integral , increase exponentially with the approximation order , so it becomes extremely difficult to explore the further corrections .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the correlations among more phonons can be also included in the mcs ansatz  @xcite .",
    "more importantly , the number of variational parameters only increases with the number of the coherent states linearly , so the high order of approximations can be practically performed .",
    "it is expected that the mcs can provide insights upon the nontrivial critical behavior of the spin - boson model .",
    "a general form of the mcs in the bases of spin - up state @xmath15 and spin - down state @xmath16 can be written as @xmath35 |0\\rangle \\\\ \\sum_{n=1}^nb_n\\exp \\left [ \\sum_{k=1}^{n_b}g_{n , k}\\left ( b_k^{\\dag } -b_k\\right ) \\right ] |0\\rangle \\end{array } \\right ) ,   \\label{gs_wave}\\ ] ] where @xmath36  ( @xmath37 ) are related to the occupation probabilities of spin - up ( spin - down ) state , while @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) are the corresponding bosonic displacements of the @xmath31th mode , and @xmath40  is the vacuum state of the bosonic bath .",
