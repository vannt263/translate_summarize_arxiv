    "for semi - abelian varieties , however , no similar cohomological interpretation is known to hold in general ; in fact , the base change conductor is not even invariant under isogeny @xcite , and many of its properties remain mysterious .",
    "one of these open questions is the following conjecture , formulated by chai in @xcite .",
    "[ conj - chai ] let @xmath3 be a semi - abelian @xmath1-variety which fits into an exact sequence of algebraic @xmath1-groups @xmath9 with @xmath7 a @xmath1-torus and @xmath10 an abelian @xmath1-variety .",
    "then we have @xmath11    the fundamental difficulty underlying this conjecture is that an exact sequence of semi - abelian varieties does not give rise to an exact sequence of nron @xmath5-models , in general .",
    "chai proved the conjecture if @xmath2 is finite , using fubini s theorem for integrals with respect to the haar measure on the completion of @xmath1 .",
    "he also proved the conjecture when @xmath1 has mixed characteristic , using a different method and applying the property that @xmath8 only depends on the isogeny class of @xmath7 .",
    "if @xmath2 has characteristic zero ( more generally , if @xmath3 obtains semi - abelian reduction after a _ tame _ finite extension of @xmath1 ) , chai s conjecture can be proven in an elementary way ; see @xcite .    in the first part of the present paper ,",
    "we show that , in arbitrary characteristic , chai s conjecture is equivalent to a fubini property for the dimensions of certain _ motivic _ integrals ( theorem [ thm - fubini ] ) .",
    "we then prove in the second part of the paper that this property holds when @xmath1 has characteristic zero ( theorem [ holds ] ) .",
    "this yields a new proof of the conjecture in that case , which is close in spirit to chai s proof of the finite residue field case . to this aim",
    ", we develop a theory of dimensional integration for definable sets , which is of independent interest .",
    "the strength of our approach lies in the fact that we combine two theories of motivic integration , namely , the geometric theory of motivic integration on rigid varieties of loeser and sebag @xcite and the model - theoretic approach of cluckers and loeser @xcite .",
    "the link between both theories is proposition [ compare ] .",
    "we hope that our reformulation of chai s conjecture in terms of motivic integrals will also shed new light on the open case of the conjecture , when @xmath2 is infinite and @xmath1 has positive characteristic .",
    "the dimensional motivic integrals that we define can be viewed as specializations of the motivic integrals defined by the first two authors in @xcite ( see @xcite for a summary ) , obtained by taking dimensions .",
    "however , we preferred to develop the theory from scratch , for two reasons .",
    "if one is only interested in the dimensions of motivic integrals , the theory becomes much more accessible .",
    "but most importantly , the results we need are not formal consequences of the theory in @xcite .",
    "the fubini properties we prove do not fall in the scope of the fubini theorems in @xcite ( the reason is the lack of definable sections ) and they only hold at the level of dimensional integrals , not as equalities of motivic integrals in the grothendieck ring of definable sets .",
