    "sandpile cellular automata are the most famous example of self - organized critical ( soc ) behavior @xcite . under an external drive consisting of a slow addition of sand ( energy ) grains and the action of dissipation through the loss of energy on the lattice boundaries ,",
    "these models reach a stationary steady state . in the limit of infinitesimal driving and dissipation (",
    "this last achieved in the thermodynamic limit ) , the stationary state of sandpile models exhibits diverging response functions associated to a characteristic avalanche dynamics .",
    "this is the hallmark of a critical behavior that has attracted an enormous amount of interest as a plausible explanation of the avalanche - like critical behavior empirically observed in many natural systems @xcite .",
    "sandpile models have been at the center of an intense research activity made of both analytical studies and numerical simulations . despite the simple definition of these automata ,",
    "it turns out that their full analytical understanding is a very problematic task @xcite . as a further complication , also the numerical inspection of these models results to be particularly difficult .",
    "for example , the precise identification of universality classes has resisted for many years even the most careful numerical analysis , and only recent results have partially settled this problem @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "these refined analyses have pointed out that several sandpile models do not follow the simple finite size scaling ( fss ) form usually adopted in the description of critical behavior @xcite .",
    "for instance , the more sophisticated multiscaling approach @xcite seems to be required for a full description of the scaling properties of the original bak , tang , and wiesenfeld ( btw ) model @xcite .",
    "many sandpile features have been underlined as the possible origin of these scaling anomalies .",
    "the deterministic dynamical rules of the btw model induce nonergodic effects @xcite , that are certainly missing in stochastic models , such as the manna model @xcite , which shows a perfect fss behavior , even for moderate system sizes .",
    "a further complication of sandpile automata stems from the peculiar role of the boundary dissipation , that makes the lattice size scaling entangled with the system dynamics . in such cases ,",
    "the thermodynamic limit is essential for the dissipative dynamics of large avalanches .",
    "a clear understanding of the interplay between dissipation and size scaling has not yet been achieved and it has been recently the subject of several studies @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we address some of the aforementioned problems in the case of directed sandpile models @xcite . in this case",
    "dhar and ramaswamy obtained an exact solution for the abelian deterministic directed sandpile ( dds)@xcite , that can be used as a milestone to check the numerical simulation analysis .",
    "directed sandpiles thus become an interesting test field to study how the critical behavior is affected by the introduction of stochastic elements and dissipation .",
    "we perform large scale numerical simulations of two directed sandpile automata : the deterministic directed sandpile model @xcite and the stochastic directed sandpile model @xcite .",
    "we study both models in the case of boundary and bulk dissipation @xcite .",
    "we find , in agreement with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , that the models define two different universality classes .",
    "in addition we show that the universality class of the models does not depend on the way in which dissipation is implemented .",
    "finally we analyze the properties of anisotropic models in which the dynamics is not fully directed @xcite . in this case",
    "we observe that on large scales the critical behavior is the same of that of fully directed models . results for the stochastic model are compared with a recent theoretical approach by paczuski and bassler@xcite , that provides values for the critical exponents in perfect agreement with numerical simulations .",
    "these results are also recovered in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical analysis also points out that some critical exponent values , such as the correlation length exponents or the affinity exponent ( to be defined later on ) , are independent of the particular universality classes and common to all models considered . in order to explain this numerical evidence , we provide a phenomenological characterization of directed sandpiles based on the basic symmetries introduced by the conserved dynamics of these automata .",
    "following balance of energy arguments inspired in refs .",
    "@xcite , we derive a series of results and predictions on the value of critical exponents which are a straightforward consequence of conservation . these general results can be considered as super - universal , because they characterize the critical behavior of all directed sandpiles with local dynamical rules , independently on the specific universality class .",
    "the results presented here provide a general picture of directed models and the role of boundary and bulk dissipation in the process of self - organization .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we introduce and define the various directed models considered .",
    "iii and iv present and discuss , from the standpoint of universality , the numerical results for directed models with boundary and bulk dissipation . in sec .",
    "v we introduce anisotropic models , and present the numerical results obtained , in comparison with those of directed models . sec .",
    "vi is devoted to an analytical approach based on the conservation of energy . finally , in sec .",

    "is assigned an integer variable @xmath2 , called `` energy '' .",
    "energy is added to the system uniformly at randomly chosen sites ( @xmath3 ) . when a site becomes active , that is , when its energy becomes larger than or equal to a certain threshold @xmath4 , it topples .",
    "a toppling site loses an energy @xmath4 , that is distributed among its neighbors according to a certain set of rules .",
    "the neighbors that receive energy can become active and topple on their turn , thus generating an avalanche .",
    "the slow driving condition is effectively imposed by stopping the random energy addition during the avalanche spreading .",
    "this means that the driving time scale is infinitely large with respect to the toppling characteristic time scale .",
    "the models we consider in this section are directed , in the sense that the energy is always transported along a preferred fixed direction .",
    "we denote this preferred direction by the coordinate @xmath5 , whose positive direction is usually defined as `` downwards '' . the transverse direction ( subspace of dimension @xmath6 perpendicular to @xmath5 )",
    "will be denoted by @xmath7 .",
    "the toppling rules of the models define two main classes :    \\(i ) _ deterministic directed sandpile _ ( dds ) : in @xmath0 dimensions , the threshold is set to @xmath8 .",
    "when a site in a given hyper - plane @xmath5 topples , it sends _ deterministically _ one grain of energy to each one of its nearest and next - nearest neighbors on the hyper - plane @xmath9 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rules]a ) ) .",
    "our definition is somewhat different from the original model of dhar and ramaswamy @xcite , in both the driving and the orientation of the lattice .",
    "both models , however , are expected to share the same universality class , being deterministic and directed .",
    "numerical simulations confirm indeed this point@xcite .",
    "\\(ii ) _ stochastic directed sandpile _ ( sds ) : in this case , the threshold is @xmath10 , independently of the dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "when a site in the hyper - plane @xmath5 topples , it sends two grains of energy to two sites , _ randomly chosen _ among its @xmath11 nearest and next - nearest neighbors on the hyper - plane @xmath9 .",
    "the toppling rules of this model can be defined _ exclusive _ if the two energy grains are always distributed on different sites , fig .",
    "[ fig : rules]b ) . on the other hand",
    ", the model can be defined _ non - exclusive _ if the dynamics allows the transfer of two energy grains onto the same site , fig .",
    "[ fig : rules]c ) .",
    "we therefore report simulations on the exclusive stochastic directed sandpile ( esds ) and on the non - exclusive stochastic directed sandpile ( nesds ) . in spite of the stochastic nature of these models , we must bear in mind that they are nevertheless abelian @xcite .",
    "the discussion therefore focuses on the difference between stochastic and deterministic models .",
    "once the toppling rules have been determined , the models are finally defined by specifying the dissipation mechanism . for systems with boundary dissipation ,",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in the transverse directions @xmath7 and open at the hyper - plane @xmath12 . in this way",
    ", the models are locally conserved ; energy can only leave the system at the bottom of the lattice . in models with bulk dissipation ,",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions in both the @xmath5 and @xmath7 directions .",
    "dissipation is implemented by allowing a toppling site to loose an energy @xmath4 without transferring it with probability @xmath13@xcite .",
    "this means that , on average , an energy @xmath14 is dissipated in each toppling . in the limit @xmath15 , the system shows critical behavior @xcite .    in the stationary state we can define the probability that the addition of a single energy grain is followed by an avalanche of toppling events",
    "avalanches are then characterized by the total number of topplings @xmath16 and the time duration @xmath17 . in the limit of infinitesimal",
    "driving ( slow driving condition ) the system shows scaling behavior and the probability distributions of these quantities follow the finite - size scaling ( fss ) forms : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the characteristic size and time , respectively .",
    "the exponents @xmath21 and @xmath22 characterize the critical behavior and define the universality classes to which the models belong . in the critical region the characteristic time and size are determined only by the system size @xmath1 or the dissipation @xmath23 , in the case of boundary and bulk dissipation , respectively . in directed models , the _ affinity exponent _",
    "@xmath24 is of particular importance ; it relates the avalanche characteristic lengths in the perpendicular direction , @xmath25 , and in the parallel direction , @xmath26 , through the relation @xmath27 .",
    "this exponent characterizes the degree of anisotropy due to the preferential direction present in the transport of the energy . in other words",
    ", it expresses the self - affine properties in the scaling of avalanches .",
    "a general result concerns the average avalanche size @xmath28 , that also scales linearly with @xmath1 @xcite : a new injected grain of energy has to travel , on average , a distance of order @xmath1 before reaching the boundary . in the stationary state , to each energy grain drop must correspond , on average , an energy grain flowing out of the system .",
    "this implies that the average avalanche size corresponds to the average number of topplings needed for a grain to reach the boundary ; i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "the same result can be exactly obtained by inspecting the conservation symmetry of the model as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : conservation ] .    for the dds , the exact analytical solution in @xmath30 yields the exponents @xmath31 and @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the upper critical dimension is found to be @xmath33 , and it is also possible to find exactly the logarithmic corrections to scaling @xcite .",
    "the introduction of stochastic ingredients in the toppling dynamics of directed sandpiles has been studied recently in a model that randomly stores energy on each toppling @xcite .",
    "this model is strictly related to directed percolation and defines a universality class `` per se '' . in our case stochasticity affects only the partition of energy during topplings , and there is _ a priori _ no obvious relations between the critical behavior of these models .",
    "in this section we report results from computer simulations of deterministic and stochastic directed sandpiles , performed with boundary dissipation .",
    "the system sizes considered range from @xmath34 to @xmath35 .",
    "the statistical distribution functions have been computed averaging over @xmath36 nonzero avalanches .    in the case of boundary dissipation ,",

    "the exponent @xmath40 defines the fractal dimension of the avalanche cluster and @xmath41 is the usual dynamic critical exponent .",
    "the directed nature of the model introduces a drastic simplification , since it imposes @xmath42 . in order to compute the different exponents characterizing the dynamics of the avalanches ,",
    "we have performed the moment analysis of the distributions , in analogy to the method developed by de menech _ et al .",
    "we define the @xmath43-th moment of the avalanche size distribution on a lattice of size @xmath1 as @xmath44 .",
    "if the fss hypothesis ( [ ps ] ) is valid in the asymptotic limit of large @xmath16 , then the @xmath43-th moment has the following dependence on system size : @xmath45 the exponent @xmath46 is computed as the slope of the log - log plot of @xmath47 as a function of @xmath1 . for large enough values of @xmath43 ( i.e. , away from the region where the integral in ( [ eq : moments ] ) is dominated by its lower cut - off ) , one can compute the fractal dimension @xmath40 as the slope of @xmath48 as a function of @xmath43 : @xmath49 . on the other hand ,",
    "as we have argued in the previous section , the first moment must scale linearly with @xmath1 , which imposes @xmath50 .",

    "each added grain must be dissipated in the evolution of the avalanche , resulting in @xmath61 .",
    "this readily yields @xmath62 . in this case",
    "it is extremely important that the characteristic length of the avalanche @xmath26 is always smaller than the size of the lattice used .",
    "this allows us to study only finite size effects introduced by the dissipation probability , without spurious effects due to the finite lattice size .    the moment analysis can be straightforwardly generalized to systems with bulk dissipation . in this case",
    "the role of the system size @xmath1 as scaling parameter is played by the dissipation @xmath23 .",
    "if the fss hypothesis holds , the @xmath43-th moment for , say the size distribution , has an explicit dependence on the dissipation rate that reads : @xmath63 the new moment @xmath64 can be estimated by linear regression in a log - log plot of @xmath65 as a function of @xmath66 . once this moment is computed , the exponent @xmath67 is given by @xmath68 .",

[",
    "fig : correlseps ] .",
    "that is , the correlation length exponents are identical for both boundary and bulk dissipation .",

    ". these results also point out in a very clear way that the critical behavior of models with boundary or bulk dissipation is identical .",
    "in fact , all critical exponents @xmath84 and @xmath24 are identical in both cases@xcite .",
    "this further confirms the complete equivalence of both points of view with respect to sandpiles and shows that , at least in the directed case , the open boundary conditions usually implemented in simulations do not affect the scaling behavior in a peculiar way .",
    "of course , the open boundary conditions breaks the translational invariance of the system , but in the thermodynamic limit this effect is negligible for the asymptotic critical behavior .",
    "finally , these results validate theoretical approaches in which it is assumed a homogeneous dissipation that is much easier to treat analytically .    as a last observation it is worth remarking that also in this case , a series of exponents such as @xmath24 and @xmath85 assume values independently of the universality class of the model under study .",
    "this sort of super - universality can be explained in terms of energy conservation as we shall see in sec .",
    "[ sec : conservation ] .",
    "an important question to study in directed sandpile models is the effect on the scaling properties of any amount of diffusion along the preferred direction of transport @xmath86 .",
    "one would expect that the broken symmetry introduced by the preferential direction should prevail on large scales , so that the dynamical scaling in directed and simply anisotropic sandpiles become indistinguishable in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this fact hints towards the possibility of a unique universality class for both directed and anisotropic sandpiles .",
    "this universality class is determined uniquely by the lack of symmetry along the @xmath5 direction , and the presence or absence of stochastic elements in the definition of the models .    in order to test this conjecture ,",
    "we have performed numerical simulations of an anisotropic stochastic sandpile model , defined according to the following rules : on a hyper - cubic lattice of size @xmath1 , we consider a model with threshold @xmath10 .",
    "when a site topples , it sends two grains of energy to two sites , randomly selected among the @xmath87 nearest and next - nearest neighbors on the hyper - plane @xmath9 , _ and _ the nearest neighbor on the hyper - plane @xmath88 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : rulesaniso ] .",
    "the rules in this model are defined non - exclusive , in such a way that the same site can receive the two sand grain expelled by an active site .",
    "the model is clearly anisotropic , because the probability to transfer energy in the downwards direction is three times larger that in the upwards direction .",
    "it would thus correspond to a non - exclusive stochastic anisotropic sandpile ( nesas ) .",
    "we consider only the case of boundary dissipation , performing simulations for sizes ranging from @xmath34 up to @xmath89 , and averaging over @xmath36 nonzero avalanches .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : correlsaniso ] we plot the correlation length @xmath26 and @xmath25 , measured according to the rules given in eqs .",

    "we confirm the expectation that anisotropic models have the same scaling properties , as regards the scaling of the correlation lengths , as directed models with the same deterministic or stochastic ingredients .",
    "we have also measured the exponents @xmath90 , and @xmath41 for this model , using the moment analysis technique .",
    "the values found are @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 .",
    "these results , compared with tables  [ tablel ] and  [ tableeps ] , show that this anisotropic models belongs to the same universality class of the esds and nesds directed models , confirming the irrelevance of the diffusion along the preferred direction @xmath5 .",
    "we have seen in the preceding sections that a subset of critical exponents characterizing the critical behavior of directed and anisotropic models have an interesting super - universal property ; i.e. they are independent of the universality class of the models . in order to understand this feature",
    "we perform a theoretical analysis based on the conservation of energy , that is the basic symmetry in standard sandpile automata .",
    "we shall see in the following that the super - universal character of some critical exponents is dictated by simple energy conservation considerations .",
    "the use of this approach allows also to establish a relation between boundary and bulk dissipation models by introducing an effective dissipation that depends on the system size .",
    "the avalanche dynamics in sandpile models is implicitly due to the imposed infinite time scale separation between driving and dissipation @xcite . in order to devise a theory that can take into account the symmetry introduced by the energy conservation",
    ", one must first regularize the rules of the models in such a way that a single time scale is ruling the dynamics .",
    "one way to do so is to introduce a nonzero driving rate , defined as the probability per unit time @xmath95 of a site to receive a grain of energy @xcite .",
    "this driving rate plays the role of an external field and leads to the soc behavior in the limit @xmath96 . on the other hand ,",
    "given that the toppling rules are conserved , energy can leave the system only at the boundaries .",
    "boundary dissipation is a natural choice in computer simulations .",
    "however , it introduces undesirable complications due to its singular character in a local theory .",
    "it is therefore convenient to use an homogeneous effective dissipation @xmath23 , defined as the average energy lost in each toppling event .",
    "as observed in previous sections , one can define models with periodic boundary conditions and built - in bulk dissipation . when constructing the local theory for models with open boundary conditions , the bulk dissipation @xmath23 amounts to an effective parameter that is to be related to the system size @xmath1 .",
    "with all these ingredients , we are ready to formulate conservation of energy as a continuous equation . in sandpiles ,",
    "we define the order parameter @xmath97 as the density of active sites ( i.e. , whose height @xmath98 ) .",
    "the only dynamics in the model is obviously due to the field @xmath99 , which is coupled to the local energy density , @xmath100 ( i.e. the local density of sandgrains ) , which enhances or suppresses the generation of new active sites .",
    "a langevin description for sandpile automata is possible by considering the dynamics of the local order - parameter field @xmath99 in a coarse - grained picture , bearing in mind that the energy density @xmath100 is a _ conserved _ field . in refs .",
    "@xcite , in analogy with absorbing - state phase transitions @xcite , a pair of coupled dynamical equations for the fields @xmath99 and @xmath100 were proposed . in the following",
    "we elucidate the consequences of energy conservation and we focus only on the latter equation . the interested reader can find the full set of equations in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the next subsections",
    "we shall consider separately directed and anisotropic models .",
    "we seek a continuous equation for the coarse - grained local density of energy , @xmath100 . in the limit of zero driving and dissipation",
    ", energy is conserved .",
    "therefore , the evolution equation fulfilled by the local field @xmath101 is : @xmath102 the first term simply represents the diffusion of energy ; the second term accounts for the dissipation that is associated with every toppling event ; the third term represents the external driving . finally , the last term is a source of stochastic noise , that accounts for the randomness in the flow of energy .",
    "the noise term can be generated by the toppling rules in a stochastic model , or by the initial conditions plus the random driving in a deterministic model .",
    "we will require the noise to have zero average : @xmath103 the noise correlator @xmath104 is of fundamental importance for the determination of universality classes and the critical behavior of the order parameter .",
    "however , for our present purposes we do not need precise knowledge of its analytical form ( for a detailed discussion , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    the current can be constructed by appealing to the symmetries of the model .",
    "the transport of energy is due to topplings .",
    "these are isotropic along the transversal direction @xmath7 , therefore the current along this direction will be proportional to the _ gradient _ of the density of active sites . in the preferred direction , on the other hand , all the energy is transferred downwards ; therefore , the current in this direction must be proportional to the _ density _ of active sites .",
    "the final form of the current is then @xmath105 plugging this expression into the equation for the energy , we have the final result : @xmath106 where the symbol @xmath107 stands for the partial derivative @xmath108 .",
    "this is the general conservation equation for any directed sandpile model .",
    "it is worth remarking at this point that the energy field is a static field , in the sense that energy diffuses only if active sites are present in the system .",
    "this is intuitively understood in sandpile models , where energy ( sand ) grains diffuse only from toppling sites .    to analyze the consequences of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finaldirected ] ) , it proves useful to define the susceptibility @xmath109 @xcite : @xmath110 where the symbol @xmath111 denotes an average over the noise distribution . by definition ,",
    "the susceptibility measures the average increase in the number of active sites due to an impulsive perturbation , that is , to the addition of a single energy grain .",
    "since we measure the size of the avalanches by the total number of topplings , the average avalanche size is given by @xmath112 taking the functional derivative of eq .",
    "( [ eq : finaldirected ] ) and averaging over time and noise , we obtain , in the limit @xmath113 , in which the sandpile is in a stationary state with constant average energy , the following equation for the static susceptibility : @xmath114 this equation can be easily solved in fourier space .",

    "( [ eq : suscepteq ] ) , we obtain the solution @xmath116 which yields the susceptibility in real space @xmath117 the integral in @xmath43 is easily performed by residues .",
    "the remaining @xmath6 integrals in @xmath118 become then decoupled gaussian integrals that yield the result , setting @xmath119 : @xmath120 eq .",

    "( [ eq : correlexps ] ) , then we have for directed sandpiles @xmath81 and @xmath82 . from these last expressions , we can read off a first exact result for directed sandpiles : the avalanches produced in those models are elongated , with characteristic length in the parallel and transversal directions related by an affinity exponent @xmath83 .",
    "it is very important to stress that these results are independent of the particular model consider and of the dimensionality @xmath0 of the system , dictated only by the energy balance in the stationary state .",
    "we can use the result ( [ eq : correls ] ) to relate the effective bulk dissipation with the system size in a model with open boundary conditions . to sustain a steady state with constant average energy , avalanches must reach the bottom boundary in order to be able to dissipate .",
    "this means that the characteristic length of the avalanches in the parallel direction must be proportional to the system size @xmath125 .",
    "we have therefore that in boundary dissipation models we can define an effective dissipation rate @xmath23 that is related with the system size by : @xmath126 from this relations we easily find that @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "these identities are recovered in numerical simulations ( see tables  [ tablel ] and  [ tableeps ] ) . finally , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : susceptq ] ) , we can recover the well - known result linking the system size and the average avalanche size , @xmath129 @xcite .",
    "that is , for any directed model , the average avalanche size must scale as the inverse of the dissipation , in the case of model with bulk dissipation , or as the size of the system along the preferred direction of transport for sandpiles defined with boundary dissipation .",
    "having completed the analysis of directed sandpiles , we turn our attention to the more complex case of anisotropic sandpiles . in this kind of model ,",
    "the transport of energy is not strictly directed in the parallel direction , but is simply stronger in the direction @xmath130 than in the opposite direction @xmath131 .",
    "the presence of backwards flow allows the possibility of diffusion in the preferred direction , and thus the equation for the conservation of energy becomes in this case @xmath132 even though it is straightforward to obtain eq .",
    "( [ eq : finalaniso ] ) by symmetry arguments ,",
    "it is instructive to derive it also starting from the anisotropy of the microscopic rules . to this end , let us consider a one dimensional model in which active sites , when toppling , send a fraction of energy @xmath13 to the left neighbor , and a fraction @xmath133 to the right neighbor , with @xmath134 . let us coarse - grain the line into cells of a certain ( small ) size .",
