    "turbulence of scroll waves is a sort of spatiotemporal chaos that is observed in some three - dimensional ( 3d ) excitable media  @xcite . in cardiac tissue , such chaotic behaviour",
    "is known as fibrillation @xcite and implies cardiac failure .",
    "the current method for terminating fibrillation in cardiac tissue is by means of a single electric pulse with a large amplitude .",
    "however , this approach is far from ideal .",
    "there are several known side - effects linked to the administration of the large electric shocks to patients @xcite .",
    "termination of fibrillation using shocks with a lower amplitude would overcome such problems",
    ".    resonant drift of a spiral wave in two dimensions ( 2d ) has been observed when one of the parameters of a model of an excitable medium was changed in time , with the period equal to that of the spiral wave @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon was later shown to be generic for reaction - diffusion excitable systems @xcite .",
    "thus it appeared that resonant drift could be used for moving the spiral wave around the medium to a boundary where it would terminate .",
    "numerical experiments with reaction - diffusion models revealed that when close to boundaries , the period of the spiral wave changes , thus destroying the resonance in such a way that the drift trajectory turns away from the boundary .",
    "the main reason for this unruly behaviour is `` resonant repulsion '' , caused by the untuning of the resonance between the spiral and the perturbation , due to the variation of the spiral s own frequency @xcite .",
    "this can be rectified by adjusting the frequency of the external forcing accordingly , based on some kind of feedback obtained from the re - entry itself .",
    "feedback control of the resonant drift has been shown to overcome repulsion from the boundaries and inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "the same method can also eliminate multiple spiral waves , thus demonstrating that multiplicity of re - entrant sources in fibrillation is not in itself an obstacle for low - voltage defibrillation by this method  @xcite .",
    "chambers of a heart , particularly ventricles , are 3d , so termination of scroll waves should be studied .",
    "scroll wave turbulence presents a new challenge for resonant drift control , since here we are dealing not only with multiple sources , but sources that tend to multiply .",
    "a scroll wave rotates around a central filament . depending on the parameters of the medium , a filament of a circular shape may gradually contract or expand with time @xcite . for filaments of arbitrary shape",
    ", this property translates into `` filament tension ''  @xcite .    in excitable media , if a circular filament contracts , then a filament of any shape in the same medium has `` positive tension '' and will shorten with time .",
    "scroll waves with positive filament tension therefore either collapse or stabilise to a straight shape . in a bounded medium",
    "this can lead to the self - termination of the scroll .",
    "if a circular filament expands , then any filament shape is unstable as the filament has `` negative tension '' and will tend to lengthen .",
    "it was therefore conjectured  @xcite and subsequently demonstrated  @xcite that such excitable media of sufficiently big size should support `` turbulence '' of scroll waves , where the scroll filaments grow , spontaneously bend , and break up to fragments upon collision with boundaries and with each other .",
    "negative filament tension is not the only mechanism of scroll wave turbulence : similar behaviour may occur due to non - uniform anisotropy of diffusivity , like that found in a ventricular wall  @xcite .",
    "alonso _ et al . _",
    "@xcite considered the effect of applying a periodic _ non - resonant _ forcing on scroll wave turbulence produced by negative filament tension . by numerical simulations of the barkley model",
    ", they showed that periodic modulation of the medium s excitability with constant frequency higher than the frequency of the scroll waves can control the turbulence in the medium .",
    "they went on to propose a theory of this effect , based on the `` kinematic description '' of the scroll waves  @xcite .",
    "their interpretation is that faster - than - resonant stimulation can effectively change the filament tension from negative to positive , thus disrupting the mechanism supporting the multiplication of scroll flaments , and compelling them to collapse .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the possibility of eliminating scroll turbulence by _ resonant _ stimulation has not been been investigated so far .",
    "we set this task for the present study .    in this study",
    "we compare suppression of the scroll wave turbulence using ( 1 ) modulation of the medium s excitability , as used by alonso _",
    "et al . _  in @xcite , to enable comparison of our resonant forcing results with their non - resonant forcing , and ( 2 ) an `` extra transmembrane current '' forcing , as in @xcite . keeping in mind single shock cardiac defibrillation used in clinical practice , we also compare repetitive external forcing of constant and feedback controlled frequencies to a single pulse extra current forcing .",
    "our results show that resonant perturbation ensures the quickest termination of the scroll wave turbulence .",
    "feedback controlled external perturbation was as effective as constant frequency resonant perturbation , but offers the advantage of not having to know the correct frequency _ a priori_. the resonant and feedback - controlled forcing suppress the 3d turbulence using amplitudes one order of magnitude lower than that of a single pulse currently used in clinical practice to terminate fibrillation .",
    "the 3d numerical simulations presented here were performed using the barkley model of excitable media @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a small parameter @xmath2 characterising mutual time scales of the fast @xmath3 and slow @xmath4 variables , and @xmath5 and @xmath6 specify the kinetic properties of the system .",
    "parameter @xmath6 determines the excitation threshold and thus controls the excitability of the medium .",
    "the term @xmath7 represents an `` extra transmembrane current '' .      for numerical simulations , we used ezscroll software by barkley _ et al._@xcite , modified appropriately to describe the stimulation .",
    "we used a 19-points finite difference approximation of the laplacian with equal discretization steps @xmath8 in all three spatial directions , and an implicit first order euler time stepping with a time step @xmath9 .",
    "simulations were run in a box @xmath10 ^ 3 $ ] , with neumann boundary conditions . in most simulations , we used @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .    in all simulations",
    "the model parameters were chosen as @xmath14 , @xmath15 ( or the average value of @xmath16 when it varied ) , and @xmath17 , as in @xcite . at this set of parameters",
    "a scroll wave will have negative filament tension .",
    "the choice of parameters was the same as in @xcite to allow comparison , with the exception of the discretization steps .",
    "we used cruder discretization steps , which allowed us to perform more simulations within reasonable cpu time .",
    "we performed also selected control simulations with @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath13 , as in @xcite ; the results were quantitatively somewhat different but qualitatively similar ( see below for details ) .          the development of scroll wave turbulence is presented in fig .  [ genturb ] .",
    "starting at @xmath20 with the standard ezscroll scroll ring initial conditions in an unperturbed medium , the negative tension of the initial scroll ring caused elongation and bending of the filament .",
    "interaction with the boundaries caused the filament to fragment and soon a complex tangle of many filaments filling the volume was observed .",
    "the turbulent state of the system was saved at five different times @xmath21 , and then each state used as an initial condition in our simulations .",
    "there are different ways to define resonance between the forcing and the turbulence it is aimed to control .",
    "we considered three different frequencies , to which the forcing frequency can be compared :    * the rotation frequency of an unforced vortex around its filament @xmath22 .",
    "it is also the frequency of a 2d spiral wave in a large enough medium .",
    "it is typically used as the leading - order approximation in any perturbative theoretical approaches , as  @xcite . * the mean frequency of the unforced turbulence @xmath23 .",
    "it is different from @xmath22 due to interaction of scrolls with each other and with boundaries .",
    "this difference can be significant as this interaction is the only factor that stops the filaments growth in length and number . * the mean frequency of the forced turbulence @xmath24 , which depends on the forcing amplitude @xmath25 , and the forcing frequency @xmath26 ( see fig .  [ figfreq](a , b ) ) . by definition , @xmath27 for any @xmath26 .",
    "the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath23 is less obvious from the theoretical viewpoint than the difference between @xmath23 and @xmath22 , as the theory of resonant drift of the scroll wave turbulence is yet to be developed .",
    "yet we suppose that it is @xmath28 that is to be compared to the forcing frequency to determine resonance , since it represents the _ de facto _ state of the controlled system regardless of the detailed mechanisms that brought it into that state .",
    "the frequency @xmath22 was measured for a single straight scroll .",
    "the frequencies @xmath23 and @xmath24 were both measured by recording the intervals @xmath29 between the moments @xmath30 in which wavefronts passed through a recording point @xmath31 , that is , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , where @xmath34 , and @xmath35 .",

    "a definitive answer to this question requires further investigation .",
    "as the resonant window may not be known _ a priori _ , we tested a simple algorithm for the feedback control with the extra current forcing .",
    "it has been previously shown in 2d that applying a repetitive feedback controlled forcing causes a spiral wave to drift to a boundary along a predictable trajectory @xcite , and possibly terminating it faster than with the constant frequency forcing , as feedback forcing can overcome the `` resonant repulsion '' of the drifting spirals from boundaries and inhomogeneities @xcite .",
    "simulations of spiral waves in the two - dimensional version of our model easily demonstrate resonant repulsion ( see fig .",
    "[ 2dsquiggle](a ) ) , so it must play some role in 3d behaviour as well , even though it may be not straightforward in scroll",
    "turbulence.our 3d experiments show that the termination with a feedback - controlled forcing is nevertheless achievable even at relatively weak amplitudes .",
    "our results also show that the location of the recording point is important for a successful feedback - controlled termination , which is in good agreement with earlier observations of feedback - driven resonant drift in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "the most successful locations , in the 3d experiments , appear to be the corner or the edge of the medium . the center location for the recording point appears to be the worst for all forcing amplitudes tested .",
    "it has been shown in 2d experiments @xcite that a line of recording points is a robust approach . therefore",
    ", if the same holds for 3d , a line of recording points down one edge of the medium may be the optimal choice .          typically , the average termination time using feedback is close to that achieved at resonant constant frequencies . at the lowest stimulation amplitudes , both feedback - controlled and constant - frequency termination times increase , and the probability of success decreases .    for a range of frequencies within or near the resonant window ,",
    "the termination was achieved , on average , quicker than with feedback . to elucidate a possible reason for this difference",
    ", we have considered a two - dimensional version of the barkley model , with the same model parameters and applied the same feedback controlled forcing as in our 3d simulations .",
    "we have found that applying a forcing with feedback in this case causes the spiral wave to drift along a rather complicated `` snaky '' trajectory , shown in fig .  [",
    "2dsquiggle](b ) .",
    "this behaviour is similar to that described recently by zykov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , and is caused by an instability , related to the delay between a change of the position or phase of the spiral and its detection by the feedback electrode , due to the distance between them and a finite speed of the waves . indeed , in fig .",
    "[ 2dsquiggle ] the spiral core is more than one wavelength away from the recording point .",
    "it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ 2dsquiggle](b ) at @xmath118 that this resonantly drifting spiral does not terminate at the boundary .",
    "instead , it embarks on a continuous loop near the boundary of the medium .    according to @xcite ,",
    "this ` snake instability ' should disappear at lower amplitudes .",
    "indeed , this is what happened in our simulations , see fig .",
    "[ 2dsquiggle](c , d ) .",
    "the instability was less pronounced when the amplitude is decreased from @xmath79 in ( b ) to @xmath119 in ( c ) , and was completely gone for @xmath120 in ( d ) . however , although the drift trajectory towards the boundary was shorter , the drift velocity was smaller proportionally to @xmath25 , so the time to reaching the boundary did not decrease .",
    "besides , the decrease in @xmath25 made annihilation at the boundary even less likely : in ( c ) the spiral stuck near the boundary similar to ( b ) , whereas at a further reduction of @xmath25 in ( d ) it embarked on a drift along the boundary which was faster than its resonant drift in the center of the domain .",
    "so , reducing the amplitude is not necessarily a satisfactory solution to the problem of the ` snake instability ' interference with terminating the vortex .",
    "alternative solution could be to reduce the delay in the feedback , say by using a global ( ecg ) rather than local ( point electrogram ) signals .",
    "however , in known computer models and experimental observations , scroll wave are apparently rather large in the scale of the heart chambers and are typically no more than one wavelength away from a boundary .",
    "thus the ` snake instability ' may not be a problem in a real heart ."
