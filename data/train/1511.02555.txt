    "the nuclear @xmath0 decay has been one of the most important tools to study nuclear forces and nuclear structure  @xcite . even today",
    ", its role can not be overemphasized in the investigation of nuclear properties and , in particular , in identifying syntheses of new elements  @xcite .",
    "although many facets of the nuclear force were uncovered and understood , there still remain a lot of questions to be explored .",
    "one very naive , but quite nontrivial question would be how many nucleons can aggregate in the heaviest nucleus . since every nucleus is dynamical and",
    "the @xmath0 decay is one of the major decay processes of heavy nuclei , the investigation of @xmath0 decays of superheavy elements is required to find a clue to answer this question .",
    "the structure of superheavy elements and their syntheses have been exciting research topics in both experimental and theoretical nuclear physics  @xcite .",
    "these topics attract recent research interests thanks to the construction of new facilities of rare isotope beams , which allow the investigation of very neutron - rich nuclei as well as superheavy elements .",
    "the stability of nuclei can be achieved through the balance between the attractive nuclear force and the repulsive coulomb force .",
    "as the number of protons increases , the coulomb repulsion increases , thus more neutrons are required to form a bound state .",
    "however , the energy of neutron - rich nuclear matter is higher than that of symmetric nuclear matter because of the nuclear symmetry energy contribution to the total energy . therefore , the nuclear symmetry energy is important to understand the structure of heavy , in particular , very neutron - rich nuclei  @xcite",
    ". furthermore , heavy nuclei eventually decay through electron , nucleon , and @xmath0 emissions , so it deserves to study the role of nuclear symmetry energy or the change of nuclear potential due to nuclear isospin asymmetry in these decay processes .    in the standard approach ,",
    "the @xmath0 decay lifetimes are governed by the effective potential for the nuclear force which combines the core nucleus and the @xmath0 cluster .",
    "there are several phenomenological potential models for explaining the measured data of @xmath0 decay lifetimes , which include the simple @xmath0 cluster model with a square well potential model  @xcite , @xmath1-type potential model  @xcite , generalized liquid droplet model ( gldm )  @xcite , and density - dependent m3y ( ddm3y ) effective interaction  @xcite . in the simple cluster model ,",
    "the @xmath0 particle is trapped by the core nucleus in a nuclear plus coulomb potential and the @xmath0 decay happens as the bound @xmath0 particle escapes from the potential barrier by quantum tunneling .",
    "the shape of the effective nuclear potential felt by the @xmath0 particle is determined by fitting the parameters of the potential to the measured @xmath0 decay lifetimes . despite its simplicity , these models are quite successful to describe @xmath0 decay lifetimes even quantitatively  @xcite . for a more complete description of the data , one , of course ,",
    "needs to develop more realistic potential models for the @xmath0 particle .",
    "improvement of simple potential models has been pursued in several ways .",
    "for example , in the simple potential models illustrated above , the shape of a nucleus is robust and does not change during the decay process .",
    "therefore , more realistic treatment on the shape evolution was anticipated and investigated , e.g. , in the gldm in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand , it is also desirable to understand the @xmath0 potential in nuclear matter from a microscopic approach . along this direction , the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite parameterized the @xmath0 particle potential using three yukawa - type finite range forces that are modified by nuclear density . in this approach , it is assumed that the core nucleus follows the fermi density profile and the @xmath0 particle has the gaussian density profile .    in the present work , we explore the nuclear isospin asymmetry effects in @xmath0 decay half - lives of heavy nuclei .",
    "the effects of the nuclear symmetry energy , i.e. , the nuclear isospin asymmetry effects , were considered in the computation of the @xmath2 value of the emergent @xmath0 particle in refs .",
    "but the nuclear symmetry energy can affect the @xmath0 decay lifetimes also through the nuclear potential of the @xmath0 particle .",
    "therefore , it would be legitimate to investigate the effects of the nuclear symmetry energy on @xmath0 decay lifetimes through the modifications of the effective potential of the @xmath0 particle , which may affect , in particular , the @xmath0 decay half - lives of neutron - rich nuclei .",
    "we will address this issue in the present work .",
    "recent progress shows that the nuclear symmetry energy is well constrained both by experimental data and theoretical calculations at least near the normal nuclear density , and its effects have been investigated widely in various physical quantities of systems from nuclei to neutron stars  @xcite . since far neutron - rich nuclei play a crucial role in understanding of exotic nuclear structure , it is important to see how the nuclear symmetry energy affects the @xmath0 decay lifetimes  @xcite . in principle , therefore , the nuclear symmetry energy should be considered in developing the effective @xmath0 potential . instead of invoking a complex microscopic calculation , however , we revisit the simple cluster model and modify the @xmath0 particle potential by including the isospin asymmetry term .",
    "the model parameters are then fitted to the existing experimental data and they are used to predict the lifetimes of unknown elements . for a model based on more microscopic approach we also suggest a potential as a functional of proton and neutron densities relying on the skyrme force model . finally , we will discuss the modification of the empirical formula of viola and seaborg for @xmath0 decay lifetimes by explicitly including the isospin asymmetry term .",

    "[ sec : theory ] , we discuss the general features of the potential model for nuclear @xmath0 decay .",
    "to investigate the nuclear isospin asymmetry effects , we first consider the square well potential and the woods - saxon potential , and then suggest a potential motivated by the skyrme force model before we discuss the modification of the empirical viola - seaborg formula .",

    "in this section , we briefly review and introduce potential models for the @xmath0 particle . the fitting process to find the values of the potential parameters is also shortly described .      in the present work , with a given model potential , we make use of the wentzel - kramers - brillouin ( wkb ) approximation to calculate the @xmath0 decay half - lives of heavy nuclei . in the @xmath0 cluster model ,",
    "the @xmath0 particle interacts with the core nucleus , which becomes the daughter nucleus after decay , through the strong nuclear interaction and coulomb interaction .",
    "even though the @xmath0 particle has a finite size ( @xmath7 fm ) , it is negligibly small since its volume fraction to the decaying nucleus , or mother nucleus , is less than @xmath8 if @xmath9 .",

    "we consider three models for the potential and explore a possible modification of the empirical viola - seaborg formula for @xmath0 decay half - lives .",

    "<S> the effects of nuclear isospin asymmetry on @xmath0 decay lifetimes of heavy nuclei are investigated within various phenomenological models of nuclear potential for the @xmath0 particle . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the widely used simple square well potential and woods - saxon potential , and modify them by including an isospin asymmetry term . </S>",
    "<S> we then suggest a model for the potential of the @xmath0 particle motivated by a microscopic phenomenological approach of the skyrme force model , which naturally introduce the isospin dependent form of the nuclear potential for the @xmath0 particle . </S>",
    "<S> the empirical @xmath0 decay lifetime formula of viola and seaborg is also modified to include isospin asymmetry effects . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained @xmath0 decay half - lives are in good agreement with the experimental data and we find that including the nuclear isospin effects somehow improves the theoretical results for @xmath0 decay half - lives . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these results are discussed and the predictions on the @xmath0 decay lifetimes of superheavy elements are also presented . </S>"
