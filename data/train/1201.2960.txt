    "naively one might expect the two protons to result in a bigger @xmath13 value for @xmath2c than for @xmath2be .",
    "for example , a simple classical isoscalar liquid drop model  @xcite is driven by charge : the carbon isotope has a larger quadrupole moment ( @xmath24  @xmath25 ) and the decay strength is expected to be larger in @xmath2c compared to @xmath2be by a factor ( 6/4)@xmath26 = 2.25 .",
    "in contrast , simple shell models  @xcite always have properly constructed quantum - mechanical wave functions for states and allow the electromagnetic decay to be separated into isoscalar and isovector components . for the @xmath17 = 10 system , the isovector contributions are predicted to be small , symmetric , and act to enhance the decay in @xmath2be and suppress it in @xmath2c , resulting in a @xmath2c decay that should be @xmath2410@xmath27 lower than that in @xmath2be .",

    "these @xmath13 results are in excellent agreement for both the transitions in @xmath2be and also very good for @xmath2c , although they note that separating the two @xmath29 states in @xmath2c is non - trivial , leading to large error bars for the transition and quadrupole moment .",
    "the ground state energies are significantly underbound , which is not surprising for a two - nucleon force alone , but the @xmath29 states are reasonably well separated .",
