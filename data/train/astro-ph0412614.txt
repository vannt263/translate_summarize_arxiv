    "recent developments in cosmological observations have led to the so - called cosmological concordance model with @xmath1 around 0.03 , @xmath5 ( dark+baryonic ) around 0.3 and @xmath6 around 0.7 . however , as the @xmath0cdm models are dominated by hypothetical vacuum energy and non - baryonic dark matter contributions , some scientists are looking for different solutions . perhaps the most intereresting alternative model is the modified newtonian dynamics model ( mond ) proposed by @xcite .",
    "it assumes that there is no non - baryonic dark matter ( or it is negligible ) and the apparent lack of matter is only due to the modification of dynamics or gravity for small accelerations ( @xmath7 where @xmath4 is some constant ) .",
    "this model seems to work very well for spiral galaxies and many other types of objects @xcite .",
    "however , it carries with it some unresolved problems ( e.g. lack of covariance ) .",
    "the problem of the structure formation in mond was also explored by @xcite and @xcite , but they were interested in large cosmic structures and did not include gas effects .",
    "it is a good approximation for large scales , but gas effects play a crucial role in the small - scale structure formation .",
    "@xcite studied possible implications of the mond model for the formation of the very first objects in the universe .",
    "however , there we had applied mond to total gravitational acceleration , and this approach can lead to some paradoxes , e.g. time and the very occurence of collapse hardly depend on the initial overdensity . in this paper , we attempt a different approach ; namely , we apply mond to the * net * acceleration over the hubble flow only .",
    "if one wants to apply the mond model to structure formation calculations , they encounter a number of difficulties .",
    "first of all , mond is not a theory , but rather a phenomenological model . in its present form , mond",
    "is inconsistent with general relativity .",
    "although @xcite found a relativistic gravitation theory that gives mond - like predictions in the low - gravity limit , it needs to be verified .",
    "mond is a model that modifies either dynamics or gravity ( in this paper we assume the latter ) .",
    "it introduces a new fundamental scale , usually called @xmath4 .",
    "gravitational fields much stronger than @xmath4 are identical to their newtonian limit @xmath8 , and very weak fields are @xmath9 . according to @xcite , the value of the fundamental acceleration scale is @xmath10 .",
    "more precisely , the strength of the gravitational field may be written as    @xmath11    where @xmath12 is some function that interpolates between these two extreme cases .",
    "this function is not specified in the model .",
    "we have decided to apply the function used by @xcite :    @xmath13    and , finally ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",
    "the conseqences of mond for cosmology have not been studied in detail yet .",
    "@xcite suggested that because in the early universe the mond radius is much lower than that of the horizon , the evolution of the scale factor is described by the standard friedmann equations .",
    "also in theory described by @xcite cosmological models are similar to the friedmann ones so we follow this assumption and study the formation of the first objects in the universe with modified dynamics .",
    "we adopted this approach in @xcite , but , as mentioned in the introduction , this may lead to some paradoxes  in particular , even underdense regions of the universe may collapse . in order to avoid that problem ,",
    "we have tried another approach appliying mond to the * net * acceleration / deceleration over the hubble flow . in this approach , only clouds with * positive * overdensity may stop their expansion and recollapse , so the final formula for gravitational acceleration ( or deceleration ) is    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the deceleration ( or acceleration ) due to the hubble flow .",
    "if we take perfect gas instead of the pressureless fluid , the evolution will look different because the effects of pressure will moderate the recollapse , especially for small systems . since we assume spherical symmetry , lagrangian coordinates are used .    in the newtonian case , dynamics",
    "is governed by the following equations :    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the radius of a sphere of mass @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the internal energy per unit mass , @xmath22 is pressure and @xmath23 is mass density . here ,",
    "eq.([ciaglosc ] ) is the continuity equation , ( [ promien ] ) and ( [ predkosc ] ) give acceleration and ( [ energia ] ) accounts for energy conservation .",
    "the last term in eq.([energia ] ) describes gas cooling / heating , with @xmath0 being energy absorption ( emission ) rate per unit volume , given in detail in @xcite .",
    "we use the equation of state of perfect gas    @xmath24    where @xmath25 , as the primordial baryonic matter after recombination is assumed to be composed mainly of monoatomic hydrogen and helium , with the fraction of molecular hydrogen @xmath26 always less than @xmath27 .",
    "in the case of modified gravity , equation ( [ predkosc ] ) will look somewhat different :    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is inverse to function @xmath12 mentioned before , asymptotically equal to @xmath30 for @xmath31 and to @xmath32 for @xmath33 , while @xmath17 may be expressed as    @xmath34 r .",
    "\\label{gh}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath35 is the current value of the hubble parameter , @xmath1 , @xmath36 and @xmath6 are the current fractions of baryons , radiation and dark energy in terms of the critical density of the universe , and @xmath37 is the redshift .      in our calculations ,",
    "we include all of the relevant thermal and chemical processes in the primordial gas . in this paper , we have taken into account nine species : h , h@xmath38 , h@xmath39 , he , he@xmath39 , he@xmath40 , h@xmath41 , h@xmath42 and e@xmath38 .",
    "the abundance of various species changes with time due to chemical reactions , ionization and dissociation photoprocesses .",
    "the chemical reactions include such processes as ionization of hydrogen and helium by electrons , recombination of ions with electrons , formation of negative hydrogen ions , formation of h@xmath41 molecules , etc .",
    "a full list of the relevant chemical reactions and appriopriate formulae is given in @xcite .",
    "the time evolution of the number density of component @xmath43 is described by the kinetic equation :    @xmath44    the first component on the right - hand side of this equation describes the chemical reactions , and the other one accounts for photoionization and photodissociation processes .",
    "coefficients @xmath45 are reaction rates , quantities @xmath46 are photoionization or photodissociation rates , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are numbers equal to 0 , @xmath49 or @xmath50 depending on the reaction .",
    "all reaction rates , as well as photoionization and photodissociation rates are given in @xcite .",
    "the cooling ( heating ) function @xmath51 includes effects of collisional ionization of h , he and he@xmath39 , recombination to h , he and he@xmath39 , collisional excitation of h and he@xmath39 , bremsstrahlung , compton cooling and cooling by deexcitation of h@xmath41 molecules .",
    "the formulae for the heating / cooling contributions of various processes are given in @xcite .",
    "in the simulations we used the code described in @xcite , based on those presented by @xcite and @xcite . this is a standard , one - dimensional , second - order accurate , lagrangian finite - difference scheme .",
    "the only changes consist in the modification of gravity , with the dark matter fraction @xmath52 set to zero . however , it was necessary to make significant changes in the initial conditions .",
    "first of all , we started our calculations at the end of the radiation - dominated era .",
    "for @xmath53 , @xmath54 as given by the formula provided by @xcite , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 , assuming @xmath57 and @xmath58=2.7277 k. we assumed that , like in the standard cosmology , initial overdensities may grow only in the matter - dominated era .",
    "we used our own code to calculate the initial chemical composition and initial gas temperature .",
    "when compared with the results obtained by @xcite , ours are very similar  the agreement is at the level of 10 - 20% .",
    "the difference is probably due to the fact that galli and palla had included more species ( e.g. deuterium and lithium ) , and some reaction rates they used had been somewhat different .",
    "it is necessary to specify the initial baryonic matter perturbations , @xmath59 .",
    "we have decided to take values of the order of the contribution to the baryonic matter power spectrum at a given scale and redshift .",
    "the problem is that at these scales the power spectrum is known very roughly , as there are no observational data and the relevant physical processes are not known very well .",
    "the power spectrum may be calculated using the cmbfast program by @xcite @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the transfer function , @xmath62 is the wavenumber and the value of normalization constant @xmath63 is obtained from cmbfast .",
    "we also included the output of the cmb anisotropy program written by n. sugiyama , received from the author .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ delta ] .",
    "the most interesting for us are the comoving scales around 10 kpc . for these scales ,",
    "both outputs differ significantly by a factor of 100 .",
    "we decided to take our initial overdensity from in between , i.e. equal to @xmath64 . as we will show",
    ", these differences do not affect our results significantly .",
    "we apply the initial density profiles in the form of a single spherical fourier mode , also used by @xcite    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the critical density of the universe , @xmath67 , with @xmath68 being the actual value of the hubble parameter .    for this profile ,",
    "there exist two distinguished radius values , namely @xmath69 and @xmath70 , which correspond to the first zero and the first minimum of the function @xmath71 , respectively . inside the sphere of radius @xmath72 which contains mass @xmath73 ,",
    "the local density contrast is positive .",
    "the mass @xmath73 and the radius @xmath69 will be referred to as the cloud mass and the cloud radius , respectively .",
    "the local density contrast is negative for @xmath74 , with average density contrast vanishing for the sphere of radius @xmath75 and mass @xmath76 . according to the gravitational instability theory in the expanding universe ,",
    "the shell of radius @xmath70 will expand together with the hubble flow , not undergoing any additional deceleration .",
    "this is why we regard this profile as very convenient in numerical simulations .",
    "namely , it eliminates the numerical edge effects and the mentioned shell simply follows the hubble expansion of the universe .",
    "thus , it can be regarded as the perturbation boundary , with mass @xmath76 referred to as the bound mass .",
    "it is worth noting that for radii not greater than @xmath77 this profile is very similar to the gaussian profile    @xmath78\\ ] ]    with @xmath79 .    as the initial velocity",
    ", we use the hubble velocity :    @xmath80",
    "we decided to describe the case of a pressureless collapse in mond as this makes it easier to understand why the results shown in the next section hardly depend on the initial overdensities .",
    "it is much easier to trace shells since each shell may be treated separately , so it is enough to trace the evolution of a single shell with some initial overdensity and constant mass inside .",
    "equation [ modpr ] is reduced to    @xmath81    where the expression for @xmath17 was shown in eq .",
    "we wrote a small program calculating the turnaround times for shells of various masses and initial overdensities .",
    "it starts at the beginning of the matter - dominated era with the initial velocity being the hubble velocity ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ zturn ] .    as we can see , for initial overdensities of @xmath83 and lower , the results are almost indistinguishable and not very different from those for @xmath84 .",
    "this looks very odd , but it reflects the fact that a smaller overdensity means that the shell is very deep in the mond regime and its behaviour is strongly nonlinear .",
    "now let us assume that a shell is always in the mond regime .",
    "for pure mond eq .",
    "[ modprbezc ] takes the form    @xmath85    it is a nonlinear equation , especially in the low overdensity limit .",
    "this becomes obvious if we change variables . instead of @xmath19 ,",
    "let us put @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the radius corresponding to the mass m in a homogenous universe .",
    "in other words , @xmath19 is related to the actual overdensity @xmath59 and if it is much lower than @xmath87 , it may be expressed as @xmath88 .",
    "given that , equation [ mondbezc ] may be written as    @xmath89    now we may express mass in terms of the cosmological parameters , redshift and r , and we get    @xmath90    redshift @xmath37 is a function of time , and if we put , we finally obtain    @xmath91",
    "we performed seventeen runs .",
    "the first eight were for the ` standard ' value of @xmath4 ( @xmath92 ) , various masses of the cloud ( @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ) and initial overdensities ( @xmath64 and @xmath83 , the next three were for some lower value of @xmath4 ( @xmath97 ) , initial overdensity @xmath64 and masses of the cloud equal to @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 , while the last one was for the ` standard ' value of @xmath4 but with no h@xmath41 cooling .",
    "the results are shown in figs .",
    "[ a0p01s1e3]-[a0m13s3e4 ] .",
    "most of these figures show trajectories of shells enclosing 7% , 17% , 27% ... 97% of the total mass : figs .",
    "[ a0p01s1e3]-[a0p01s3e4 ] for the ` standard ' @xmath4 and @xmath64 overdensity and figs .",
    "[ a0m13s3e3]-[a0m13s3e4 ] for the low @xmath4 , @xmath64 overdensity , respectively .",
    "in addition , fig . [ a0p01st ] shows temperatures of the same shells as in fig .",
    "[ a0p01s1e3 ] and fig .",
    "[ a0p01sx ] shows the chemical evolution for shells enclosing @xmath98 , both figures showing runs for the ` standard ' @xmath4 , @xmath64 overdensity and @xmath99 ( the results for the other masses are very similar )",
    ". the results for @xmath83 are almost idistinguishable and the run with greater mass ( @xmath100 ) but no h@xmath41 cooling showed no collapse .",
    "the results show that :    * as expected , the difference in behaviour between clouds with @xmath64 and @xmath83 overdensities is very tiny , thus the results are much less sensitive to the initial density contrast than in cdm * more massive clouds collapse faster * speed of collapse depends very strongly on @xmath4 * like in the cdm models , h@xmath41 cooling is necessary to collapse * like in the cdm models , due to the adiabatic cooling / heating , the shell temperature behaviour is opposite to that of the shell radii ; then h@xmath41 cooling becomes important and the shells collapse ; a higher mass of the cloud means higher virial temperature and faster collapse * chemical evolution is quite typical but because the collapse is very violent , it speeds up chemical reactions ; however , the final abundances of various species are not very different from the predictions of the other models , e.g. the final abundance of h@xmath41 is of the order of @xmath27 .",
    "it may appear that during the collapse , shell temperatures do not fall as deep as in cdm models , but this is a numerical artefact only .",
    "the reason is , as in @xcite , that in our code  if a shell falls below some ` small ' radius @xmath101  we treat it as ` collapsed ' : we artificially stop its dynamical and chemical evolution , assigning some small radius , freezing the temperature and including its gravitational field only .",
    "a collapse in mond is very violent , so gas shells have not enough time to cool down until their temperature is frozen by the code .",
    "we performed many other runs as well , e.g. with initial overdensities greater than @xmath84 , but the results were very similar .",
    "the reason for this is that , as shown in the previous section , in the absence of gas pressure , any positive initial overdensity lower than some reasonable value leads to a very similar turnaround time .",
    "because at this stage of evolution the gas effects are not yet very important , this also applies to the evolution with all physical processes included .",
    "this means that in the approximation the turnaround time depends on mass .",
    "then the cloud starts its initial collapse , but it gets virialised and the time between the virialisation and the final collapse depends on mass again , i.e. the bigger the mass , the faster the collapse .",
    "the wilkinson map results suggest that reionization occured at around @xmath102 .",
    "this means that the first bound objects must have been formed even earlier , perhaps at around @xmath3 .",
    "our recent simulations @xcite show that if we assume the @xmath0cdm models and take the recent estimates of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , a direct formation of low - mass objects that could possibly reionize the universe before @xmath105 is very unlikely .",
    "moreover , we doubt whether the inclusion of possible fragmentation of greater clouds could speed up the collapse enough  even if some low - mass cloud has greater overdensity than the directly forming ones , it still needs some time to cool down .",
    "in contrast , mond seems to provide a good way to solve that problem . for the ` standard ' value of @xmath4 clouds of mass @xmath94 or heavier may collapse at around @xmath3 , so that they or their cores may have formed the first stars and quasars . for lower @xmath4 , only objects of mass @xmath96 or greater",
    "may be formed directly before @xmath3 .",
    "we think this favours the ` standard ' value but one would need to perform full 3-d simulations to give a more definite answer .",
    "it may be surprising that in our simulations more massive objects form earlier , but it is due to the gas pressure , which is more important for less massive objects . if we skip that term in eq .",
    "[ predkosc ] , less massive objects stop their expansion and recollapse faster than the more massive ones .",
    "however , this is not the case for the large scale structure : on these scales , gas effects may be neglected , and although in general the mond effects are smaller , the rms fluctuations decrease so that such objects stop their expansion more slowly .",
    "if our assumptions about mond are correct , its predictions seem to be more consistent with the the early reionization suggested by the wmap results ( @xcite ; @xcite ) than the ones of the most recent @xmath0cdm models .",
    "this does not prove that mond is correct and @xmath0cdm is not .",
    "however , this suggests that cosmologists should perhaps pay more attention to mond , because it seems to be an interesting alternative to models with non - baryonic dark matter .",
    "we are very grateful to uro seljak for answering our questions about cmbfast , to n. sugiyama for sending us the output of his cmb anisotropy program , and to r.h .",
