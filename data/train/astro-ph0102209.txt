    "soon after the launch of the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) , rapid ( 3001300  hz ) , nearly periodic variability in the x - ray light curves of low mass x - ray binary systems ( lmxb s ) was discovered ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 , van  der  klis et al .",
    "these oscillations , referred to as kilohertz qpo ( quasi - periodic oscillations ) , have now been observed in over two dozen neutron star bearing lmxb s ( see van  der  klis  2000 for a review ) .",
    "they are distinguished by high frequencies and high quality factors ( q = fwhm / frequency ) , and tend to be seen in pairs , with nearly constant frequency separation between the lower and higher frequency peaks ( also called the lower and upper qpo ) .",
    "the high frequencies of kilohertz qpo are thought to tie them to phenomena taking place in the inner regions of accretion disks surrounding neutron stars , making them potentially valuable probes of strong gravity .    a broad range of theoretical ideas",
    "have been proposed to explain the phenomenology of kilohertz qpo . in these models ,",
    "one of the frequencies is generally identified as the keplerian frequency of the innermost orbit of an accretion disk . the sonic point model ( miller et al .",
    "1998 ) identifies the second frequency as the beat of the primary qpo with the spin of the neutron star .",
    "stella & vietri ( 1999 ) have proposed a general relativistic precession / apsidal motion model wherein the primary frequency is the keplerian frequency of a slightly eccentric orbit , and the secondary is due to the relativistic apsidal motion of this orbit . on the other hand , in the two oscillator model ( osherovich & titarchuk  1999 , applied to 4u1608@xmath252 ; titarchuk & osherovich 1999 ) , the secondary frequency is due to the transformation of the primary ( keplerian ) frequency in the rotating frame of the neutron star magnetosphere .",
    "the strength ( and weakness ) of these models lie in their ability ( or inability ) to predict the variation of the frequency separation with the kilohertz qpo frequency and the variation of their frequency with other low frequency qpo observed in the source ( see van der klis 2000 for a comparison of recent observations with model predictions ) .",
    "however , these dynamic models generally do not address how these dynamic oscillations affect , or couple to , the radiative processes which finally give rise to the oscillations seen in the x - ray spectra .",
    "the observed energy dependent features of the qpo , namely the strength of the qpo vs. photon energy ( fractional root mean square , or rms , vs. energy ) and the phase lag of fluctuations at different photon energies relative to variations at a reference energy , are expected to depend primarily on the radiative mechanism and its coupling to the dynamic behavior of the system .    while a unified model for kilohertz qpo , which self - consistently incorporates both the dynamical and radiative mechanisms , remains illusive , significant progress can be achieved by studying the radiative response of a system to an oscillating perturbation .",
    "such an analysis would make definite predictions about the energy dependent features of the qpo , thereby placing constraints on the radiative mechanism , and perhaps , shed light on the nature of the coupling between the dynamical and radiative processes .",
    "the power law photon energy spectra often observed in lmxb s suggests that the dominant radiative mechanism in these systems is compton up - scattering of soft photons in a hot plasma ( sunyaev & titartchuk  1980 , podznyakov et al .",
    "the temporal behavior of such models has been studied in a variety of circumstances ( e.g. wijers et al .",
    "1987 ; hua , kazanas & titarchuk  1997 ; bottcher & liang  1999 ) . for qpo in particular , both the fractional amplitude vs. energy and the relative time lag vs. energy can be predicted based upon models where a hot , uniform plasma is illuminated by soft black body photons , accounting for the system s response to variations in either the soft photons or the plasma ( wijers 1987 , lee & miller  1998 ) .    in compton up - scattering models ,",
    "a photon s mean residence time in the hot plasma increases with the energy of the escaping photon since , on average",
    ", higher energies require a larger number of scatters . thus it would seem that for these models , variability in high energy photons should be delayed relative to their lower energy counterparts ( i.e. , a hard time lag is expected ) .",
    "in fact , analysis of simple comptonization models , where the variability is caused only by oscillations in the intensity of the soft input spectrum , reveal that the time lag between the high energy , @xmath3 , and low energy , @xmath4 , photons should roughly scale as log@xmath5 ( nowak & vaughan  1996 ) .",
    "it is therefore rather surprising that soft lags ( i.e. , variability in soft photons delayed with respect to hard photons ) seem to be the norm in kilohertz qpo ( vaughan et al .",
    "1998 , kaaret et al .  1999 ,",
    "markwardt et al .  1999 ) .",
    "this inconsistency has led to the suggestion that compton down - scattering could be the dominant radiative process in these systems .",
    "however , it is difficult to reconcile the observed increase in the amplitude of the oscillations with energy with such models .",
    "moreover , this would point to the unlikely scenario in which the radiative process for the time - averaged spectrum ( compton up - scattering ) differs from that for the qpo oscillations ( compton down - scattering ) .",
    "this paper describes a compton up - scattering model that gives a consistent interpretation of the time - averaged photon spectra as well as the energy dependence of both the fractional rms amplitude and time lag for the 830  hz qpo detected in 4u1608@xmath252 on march 3 , 1996 ( berger et al .",
    "the observed soft lag is a natural consequence of the model provided that the temperatures of the plasma and of the soft photon source oscillate coherently at the qpo frequency .",
    "it is further shown that coherent oscillation of the temperatures is expected when energy transfer between the plasma and the soft photon source is taken into account .",
    "the model imposes limits on the size of the comptonizing region and places constraints on any future model invoked to explain how the dynamical origin of the qpos couples with the comptonizing medium in lmxb s .",
    "consider a uniform hot plasma characterized by its temperature ( @xmath6 ) , size ( @xmath7 ) and optical depth @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the electron number density and @xmath10 is the thomson cross section .",
    "the hot plasma up - scatters soft photons from an external source . unlike previous work",
    ", the soft photons are assumed to be described by a wien spectrum ( at a temperature @xmath11 ) instead of a black body .",
    "thus the soft photon source lies in a comptonizing region with an optical depth large enough that the emergent spectrum saturates to a wien peak .",
    "the choice of a wien spectrum rather than a black body spectrum is motivated by the expectation that ( for @xmath12 kev and for reasonable electron densities @xmath13 @xmath14 ) , the photon density inside the source will not be in thermal equilibrium .",
    "it should be noted that broad band observations of the black hole system cygnus x-1 reveal that the soft photon component ( which is assumed to provide the seed photons for comptonization ) is better described as a wien peak rather than a black body or a sum of black bodies ( di salvo et al .",
    "since the soft photon source could itself be heated by the comptonized photons from the hot plasma , it is assumed that a fraction , @xmath15 , of the comptonized photons is incident on the soft photon source . in the framework of this model , oscillations in the photon escape rate from the hot plasma",
    "are due to corresponding coherent oscillations in the plasma temperature ( @xmath6 ) and the soft photon source temperature ( @xmath11 ) while the size ( @xmath7 ) , the electron density ( @xmath9 ) and the total rate of photons emerging from the plasma remain constant .    for non -",
    "relativistic temperatures ( @xmath16 ) and low photon energies ( @xmath17 ) , the evolution of the photon density inside the hot plasma is governed by the simplified kompaneet s equation ( with the induced scattering term neglected ) ( kompaneets 1957 ) @xmath18 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + t_c\\dot{n}_s - t_c \\dot{n}_{esc}\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : komp}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath19 is the photon density inside the plasma , @xmath20 is the energy , and @xmath21 is the thomson collision time scale .",
    "the number of photons per second per unit volume injected into the plasma from the soft photon source is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a normalization constant .",
    "this is balanced by the corresponding rate of photons escaping from the plasma @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the average number of scatterings a photon undergoes before escaping .",
    "the time - averaged spectrum arising from the plasma can be estimated using @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the steady state photon number density corresponding to time - averaged values of plasma temperature ( @xmath28 ) and soft photon wien temperature ( @xmath29 ) . for @xmath30 , it can be shown from equation ( [ eq : komp ] ) that the spectrum is a power - law with photon index ( @xmath31 ) related to @xmath32 by @xmath33    lee & miller ( 1998 ) studied the temporal behavior of a comptonizing medium by computing the linear response of the photon spectrum to a sinusoidally varying physical parameter at a given angular frequency @xmath34 . following their formulation ,",
    "the plasma temperature is approximated as @xmath35 and the soft photon temperature as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 are , in general , small complex quantities .",
    "the resulting time varying photon number density is taken to be @xmath39 with the output spectrum given by @xmath40 .",
    "@xmath41 is related to @xmath42 and @xmath43 by the linearized kompaneets equation ( lee & miller  1998 ) : @xmath44 \\nonumber \\\\ & & -t_c \\dot { n}_{s0 } ( { e \\over k t_{s0 } } - 3 ) \\delta t_s\\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the above equation implicitly assumes that the soft photon source spectrum @xmath45 is a wien peak with a constant photon number flux .",
    "it is useful to define @xmath46 as the photon variation @xmath41 corresponding to a unit variation in the plasma temperature ( @xmath47 ) and similarly @xmath48 corresponding to a unit variation in the soft photon temperature ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "thus , @xmath46 ( @xmath48 ) can be computed from equation ( [ eq : linkomp ] ) by setting @xmath47 ( @xmath49 ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "since only the linear response is being considered , the variation in total photon number density can be written as @xmath52 extending this method to include higher order terms leads to harmonics of the fundamental represented by the linear response . in the absence of any",
    "observed kilohertz qpo harmonics and in view of the simple assumptions made in this model , only the linear response will be considered .",
    "variations in the plasma temperature will induce a variation in the plasma luminosity . since a fraction ( @xmath15 ) of the comptonized photons re - enter and heat up the soft photon source , a variation in the plasma luminosity causes a variation in the soft photon source temperature .",
    "thus @xmath37 and @xmath38 are related by @xmath53 where @xmath54 , the compton amplification factor , is defined as the ratio of the plasma to soft photon source luminosities . using equation ( [ eq : tot_var ] ) ,",
    "the above equation can be written as @xmath55    for a given variation in plasma temperature ( @xmath56 ) and time - averaged model parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath32 , @xmath7 , @xmath54 and @xmath15 ) , the fluctuations in the photon number density ( @xmath41 ) can be obtained from equations ( [ eq : linkomp ] ) , ( [ eq : tot_var ] ) and ( [ eq : ts2 ] ) . the complex quantity @xmath57 leads to the time lag vs. energy and amplitude vs. energy for the qpo .",
    "since the disk parameters ( @xmath6 , @xmath11 , @xmath32 and @xmath54 ) can , in principle , be constrained by fitting the time - averaged spectrum of the source , @xmath58 depends only on the amplitude of the plasma temperature variation , the plasma size , and the fraction of photons incident on the soft photon source .",
    "the predictions of the comptonization model described in  2 are compared with the rxte ( pca ) observations of the lmxb 4u1608@xmath252 on march 3 , 1996 ( berger et al .",
    "1996 ) , where a 830  hz qpo ( the lower peak  see mendez et al .",
    "1997 ) was discovered . the time - averaged spectrum from this observation",
    "is well described by the model with a reduced @xmath59 in the energy range 3 - 20 kev . the soft photon wien temperature and the photon index are well constrained to be @xmath60 kev and @xmath61 respectively .",
    "however , since no cutoff in the spectrum was observed , spectral fitting imposed only a lower limit on the plasma temperature @xmath62 kev . since the kompaneet s equation ( [ eq : komp ] ) is valid only for @xmath63 ,",
    "@xmath64 kev has been chosen for the analysis ( choosing @xmath65 kev makes no significant qualitative difference in the results ) .",
    "these values of @xmath66 and @xmath31 give @xmath67 ( equation [ eq : nescape ] ) and a compton amplification factor @xmath68 .    the model predictions and rxte observations of the amplitude ( root mean square , or rms , fraction ) as a function of energy for the 830 hz qpo ( berger et al .",
    "1996 ) are compared in figure 1 , for different values of @xmath7 and @xmath15 .",
    "the overall normalization of the curve is fixed by choosing a best fit value of @xmath69 .",
    "the predicted amplitude is zero at @xmath70 kev ( comparable to the peak of the input spectrum ) since the emergent spectrum pivots about this energy .",
    "this behavior is expected as oscillations in the soft photon wien temperature and in the plasma temperature both preserve photon number .",
    "the lag is illustrated as a function of energy in figure 2 ( vaughan et al .",
    "1998 ) compared to the model prediction for the same values of @xmath7 and @xmath15 used in figure 1 .",
    "reasonable fits to both variations are obtained for @xmath71 km @xmath72 km and @xmath73 .",
    "since the amplitudes of plasma and wien temperature oscillations are nearly equal ( i.e. @xmath74 ) , the photon fluctuations at high energies , @xmath75 kev ) , are predominately caused by @xmath37 while the photon fluctuations at low energy , @xmath76 kev ) , are predominately caused by @xmath38 .",
    "thus , the time lag between @xmath37 and @xmath77 is @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the average number of scatters a high energy photon undergoes .",
    "the time lag between @xmath37 and @xmath80 can be expressed as @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the time lag between ( @xmath37 ) and ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus the time lag between high and low energy photons is @xmath83 , so that when @xmath84 , the system will show soft lags .",
    "if the soft photon source is assumed to be a black body instead of a wien peak , an additional ad hoc oscillation in the soft photon number flux is required for the predicted rms fraction vs. energy to agree with observations .",
    "thus , a wien spectrum is favored for the soft photons , since it minimizes the number of oscillating components needed .    in our model , the primary oscillation takes place in the plasma with the soft photon source responding to the variation .",
    "alternately , it is possible that the soft photon wien temperature oscillates and , in order to keep the total luminosity of the plasma constant , induces variability in the plasma temperature . however , contrary to observations , such a model does not predict soft lags .",
    "thus it seems that the qpo manifests itself only as an oscillation in the plasma temperature , rather than variations in other parameters of the comptonization model .",
    "the large value for the fraction of comptonized photons incident on the soft photon source , @xmath85 , suggests that the geometry of the hot plasma can be described as a corona on top of a cold accretion disk .",
    "the size of the corona ( @xmath86 km ) indicates that it is a significant fraction of the radius of the disk .",
    "this result implies that the nearly coherent variability making up the kilohertz qpo is not limited to a narrow region and hints at the existence of a global mode in the corona .",
    "in such an interpretation , the high q values ( @xmath87 ) characteristic of the high frequency oscillations would provide a strong constraint on the excitation and damping of the mode ( nowak et al .",
    "we point out that the comptonizing model does not provide insight into the the detailed geometry of the source .",
    "an alternative geometry would be an x - ray source ( i.e. , the neutron star ) surrounded by a flaring accretion disk .",
    "this geometry introduces an additional time lag due to the light travel time between the comptonizing plasma and soft photon source .",
    "since the energy spectra did not exhibit an observable cutoff , the plasma temperature could be significantly larger than the assumed @xmath88 kev .",
    "in that case , the average energy transfer per scatter would become a significant fraction of the photon energy and the kompaneet s equation , and the model predictions with it , would no longer be accurate ( katz 1987 ) .",
    "hence , simple extensions of our model to higher plasma temperatures are not useful , and detailed fitting to the observations will be warranted only when models incorporating non - standard geometries in sophisticated time - dependent monte carlo methods ( incorporating energy balance ) are developed . in this light ,",
    "the ability of the simple model presented here to explain the main features of a kilohertz qpo s energy dependent properties is highly encouraging .    in the future",
    ", this work will be extended to other systems exhibiting qpos , particularly to the upper kilohertz qpo of the doublet observed in neutron star systems .",
    "such an endeavor will not only check the robustness of the results presented here , but will also provide further constraints on theoretical models of the qpo phenomenon .",
