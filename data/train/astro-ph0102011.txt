    "understanding how galaxies form and evolve into the objects we observe today remains one of the most fundamental quest of astrophysical research .",
    "even if the field is still at its beginnings , the use of numerical approaches to study how galaxies are assembled in a cosmological hierarchical scenario from primordial fluctuations , seems promising .",
    "the main advantage of these approaches ( namely hydrodynamical simulations ) is that physics is introduced at a most general level , and the dynamical processes relevant to galaxy assembly ( i.e. , collapse , gas infall , interactions , mergers , instabilities ... ) emerge naturally , rather than by assumption , and can be followed in detail .",
    "only the star forming processes need to be modelled .",
    "these considerations emphasize the interest of hydrodynamical simulations as an outstanding working tool to learn about galaxy formation and evolution from primordial fluctuations .",
    "for other approaches to this problem , see manrique et al .",
    "( in preparation ) , firmani & avila - reese ( 2000 ) and the references therein .    as discs are naturally produced in the collapse of a dissipative system embedded in a gravitational field , learning how to get well - behaved discs ( i.e. , similar to those observed in spirals ) in such simulations is one important step towards understanding galaxy assembly in general . according to the standard model of disc formation ( fall & efstathiou 1980 ) , disc - like structures with observable counterparts can form provided that the diffuse gas in the dark matter halo cools and collapses conserving its specific angular momentum , @xmath1 . in hierarchical scenarios ,",
    "halo gas cooling occurs with @xmath1 conservation in the _ quiescent _ phases of galaxy assembly , producing extended , thin discs with an exponential mass density profile in the equatorial plane ( dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ) .",
    "but _ violent _ phases play also a fundamental role in these scenarios . during these phases ,",
    "the system undergoes interactions and merger events , that can destroy discs that had possibly formed in previous quiescent phases .",
    "thus far , no hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation in fully consistent hierarchical cosmological scenarios had provided extended discs , with structural and dynamical properties similar to those observed in spiral galaxies ( see , however , recent work by sommer - larsen & dolgov 1999 ) .",
    "the objects formed were either a )  gaseous and too concentrated , when no stellar formation processes are considered at all ( navarro & benz 1991 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; evrard , summers & davis 1994 ; vedel , hellsten & sommer - larsen 1994 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; sommer - larsen , gelato & vedel 1999 ; weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 and references therein ) , or b )  rather stellar and without discs , when these processes have been included ( navarro & steinmetz 2000 ; thacker & couchman 2000 ) . in the former cases ,",
    "objects are too concentrated due to an excessive @xmath1 loss in violent events ; this is the so - called disc angular momentum catastrophe [ damc ] . in the latter cases , as discussed by tissera , siz & domnguez - tenreiro ( in preparation , hereafter tsdt ) the particular star formation implementations used lead to a too early gas transformation into stars , leaving no gas to cool and form discs at lower  @xmath2 .",
    "the effects of star formation have also been considered by katz ( 1992 ) and steinmetz & mller ( 1995 ) who obtained , in both cases , a three component system that resembles a spiral galaxy . however , their simulations treat only the case of a semi - cosmological modellization of the collapse of a constant density perturbation in solid - body rotation .",
    "sommer - larsen & dolgov ( 1999 ) have succeeded in avoiding excessive @xmath1 loss in warm dark matter scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , their discs still do not match observations very well .    this inability to reproduce",
    "observed discs in fully consistent cosmological simulations , represents clearly a major pitfall of present - day numerical simulations as a working tool to learn about galaxy formation and evolution . in a series of papers ( domnguez - tenreiro , tissera & siz 1998 ;",
    "siz , tissera & domnguez - tenreiro 1999 ; tsdt ) it has been shown that the object properties at the end of violent phases of evolution critically depend on the structural stability of the disc - like objects involved in interaction and merger events , on the one hand , and on the availability of gas to regenerate a disc structure after the last violent episode , on the other hand . concerning stability ,",
    "cold thin discs are known to be very unstable against non - axisymmetric modes ( athanassoula & sellwood 1986 ; binney & tremaine 1987 ; barnes & hernquist 1991 , 1992 ; martinet 1995 and references therein ; mihos & hernquist 1994 , 1996 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "massive haloes can stabilize discs , but not every halo is able to stabilize the pure exponential disc that would form from @xmath1-conserving diffuse gas collapse in its last quiescent phase . in these cases ,",
    "a central compact bulge is needed to ensure stability ( christodoulou , shlosman & tohline 1995 ; van den bosch 1998 , 2000 ) . otherwise ,",
    "non - axisymmetric instabilities could be easily triggered by interactions and mergers , causing important @xmath1 losses ( that is , damcs ) , followed by strong gas inflow .    in that series of papers we also show that compact central bulges form when star - forming processes are considered in hierarchical hydrodynamical simulations , provided that the particular star formation implementation used does not lead to a too early gas exhaustion ( i.e. , _ inefficient _ star formation , see silk 1999 ) .",
    "the physical processes involved in disc formation and stability when an inefficient schmidt law - like stellar formation algorithm is implemented in these simulations are discussed in detail in tsdt .",
    "the aim of this paper is to show that discs identified in galaxy - like objects produced in these hierarchical hydrodynamical simulations are , at a structural and dynamical level , similar to those observed in spirals . to this end",
    ", we analyze the structural and dynamical properties of a sample of 29 disc - like objects formed in three different such simulations .",
    "we focus on those properties that can be constrained with available data for observed spiral galaxies .",
    "these data are taken principally from the compilations of galaxy structural parameters of broeils ( 1992 , hereafter b92 ) , de  jong ( 1996 ) and courteau ( 1996 , 1997b , hereafter c97b ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : @xmath3[simu ] describes the simulations .",
    "the general characteristics of disc - like objects at @xmath4 are outlined in @xmath3[objects ] , and their bulge - disc decomposition and rotation curves are discussed in @xmath3[budi ] and @xmath3[rocu ] , respectively .",
    "finally , a summary and conclusions are presented in @xmath3[sumcon ] .",
    "we consider three simulations , s1 , s1b , and s1c , from different realizations of a given model for the primordial spectrum of the density fluctuation field . in each case , we follow the evolution of @xmath5 gas plus dark matter particles in a periodic box of comoving side 10 mpc ( @xmath6 km  s@xmath7 mpc@xmath7 with @xmath8 ) using a sph code coupled to a high resolution ap3 m code ( thomas & couchman 1992 ; see tissera , lambas & abadi 1997 for details on sph algorithm implementation ) .",
    "the initial distributions of positions and velocities of the @xmath5 particles are consistent with a standard cdm cosmology , with @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 ; one out of ten of them is randomly chosen to be a gas particle .",
    "these initial distributions are set by means of the action algorithm , kindly provided by e. bertschinger .",
    "all , dark , gas and stellar particles have the same mass , @xmath12 m@xmath13 .",
    "ap3m - sph integrations were carried out from @xmath14 to the present using fixed time steps @xmath15 years .",
    "the gravitational softening length is 3  kpc and the minimum allowed smoothing length is 1.5  kpc .",
    "these simulations include a star formation prescription described by tissera et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see tissera 2000 for a discussion on the resulting star formation history ) .",
    "the gas cools due to radiative cooling .",
    "we use the approximation for the cooling function by dalgarno & mccray ( 1972 ) for a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium .",
    "gas particles are transformed into stars if they are cold ( @xmath16 k ) , dense ( @xmath17 g  @xmath18 ) , in a convergent flow and satisfy jean s instability criterion .",
    "when a gas particle satisfies these conditions , it is transformed into a star particle after a time interval ( @xmath19 ) over which its gas mass is being converted into stars according to @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the star formation efficiency , @xmath22 is a characteristic time - scale assumed to be proportional to the dynamical time of the particle ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 is the time interval over which 99 per cent of the gas mass in a particle is expected to be transformed into stars ( navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "we adopt a low star formation [ sf ] efficiency with @xmath25 ( for a discussion of the inefficient sf implementation , see tsdt ) .",
    "no supernovae explosion effects have been considered .",
    "however , this low @xmath21 value avoids the quick depletion of gas at high  @xmath2 , leaving enough remanent gas to form disc - like structures at low  @xmath2 .",
    "to some extent , this could mimic the effects of energy injection from supernovae explosions .",
    "the treatment of supernova feedback in numerical simulations is still an open and complex problem that remains to be properly solved .",
    "galaxy - like objects are identified at their virial radius , @xmath27 , at @xmath0 .",
    "dark matter haloes formed in the s1 simulation have been extensively studied in tissera & domnguez - tenreiro ( 1998 , hereafter tdt98 ) .",
    "these haloes , as well as those formed in s1b and s1c simulations , are resolved with a relatively high number of particles ( see the number of dark mass particles , @xmath28 , per halo , in table  [ general ] ) .",
    "the main baryonic objects embedded in these dark haloes can be identified by applying a friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm to the baryonic particle distribution , with a linking length of 10 per cent the mean total interparticle separation in the box .",
    "baryonic objects identified in the simulation at @xmath0 are galaxy - like objects ( glos ) that span a range of morphological characteristics : disc - like objects ( hereafter , dlos ) , spheroids and irregular objects .",
    "dlos have external extended , populated discs , consisting mostly of gas , central stellar bulge - like concentration and , in some cases , stars in a thick disc .",
    "spheroids are mostly composed of stars forming a relaxed , spheroidal configuration , with a small amount of gas forming a small central disc .",
    "irregular objects do not have a defined morphology , and in most cases they are the end product of a recent merger . in this paper",
    "only dlos will be analyzed .",
    "only those glos with a total baryon number @xmath29 larger than @xmath30 have been considered is defined unambiguously as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the baryon number as given by the friends - of - friends algorithm for a given glo .",
    "however , some glos have close satellites that are included in the friends - of - friends algorithm , even if these satellites are dynamically and structurally different entities from the glo itself . in this case , the actual glo baryon number is @xmath33 , with @xmath34 the number of baryonic particles in the @xmath35-th satellite entering in @xmath32 . ] .",
    "this criterion has been chosen as a compromise : taking @xmath36 much higher than 150 would result into too few dlos in our sample ; taking @xmath36 much lower than 150 would result into dlos composed of too few particles to be properly analyzed .    out of our 3 simulations , we are able to identify different numbers of discs ( 9 , 13 and 7 , for a total sample of 29 objects ) and spheroids or irregular objects ( 5 , 7 and 11 , not studied in this paper ) following the previous mass - limit criterion .",
    "dlos are labelled by the three coordinates ( in 10@xmath37mesh units ) that identify the cell where the centre of mass of their host halo is found in the total box .",
    "when several haloes ( hosting either dlos , spheroids or irregulars ) are found in a given cell , a greek letter is added to distinguish among them . some haloes host more than one baryonic object ; asterisks in table  [ general ] identify haloes that include more than one baryonic object ( either dlo , spheroid or irregular ) . in this case , the different components are distinguished by means of a capital letter in order of decreasing mass . for instance , dlo # 165c ( in s1b ) belongs to a massive halo , where the more massive objects # 165a ( spheroid ) and # 165b ( irregular ) are also found ; dlos # 233a and # 233b ( in s1 ) , on the one side , and # 643@xmath38a and # 643@xmath38b ( in s1b ) , on the other side , share the same halo .",
    "the virial radius , @xmath27 , maximum limiting radius , @xmath39 ( see @xmath3[budi ] ) , dark , star and gas particle number , @xmath28 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively , within spheres of radii @xmath27 and @xmath39 for each of the 29 dlos of the sample are listed in table  [ general ] .    in fig .",
    "[ dlos](a ) we plot , for the @xmath35-th baryonic particle inside the halo hosting dlo # 242 , the cosine of the angle formed by its position and velocity vectors , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , versus @xmath44 , its distance to the dlo mass centre . in fig .",
    "[ dlos](b ) we plot @xmath45 versus @xmath44 , where @xmath46 is the component of the angular momentum per unit mass of the @xmath35-th particle parallel to @xmath47 ( disc specific total angular momentum ) .",
    "the solid line is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the circular velocity at projected distance @xmath50 ( see @xmath3[rocu ] ) . in these figures ,",
    "stars stand for stellar particles , circles for gas particles and open symbols for counter - rotating particles ( i.e. , with @xmath51 ) of any kind .",
    "these figures show that most gas particles placed at @xmath52  kpc move coherently along circular trajectories ( so that they have @xmath53 , see fig .",
    "[ dlos](a ) ) on the equatorial plane ( and so they verify @xmath54 ) , that is , they have @xmath55 , with a small dispersion around this value ( see fig .  [ dlos](b ) ; @xmath56 if the @xmath35-th particle is on the equatorial plane ) : the particles form a _ cold thin disc_. in contrast with disc gas particles , gas particles placed at @xmath57  kpc ( hereafter , halo gas particles ) do not show any order : roughly half of them are in counter - rotation ( open circles ) , their @xmath58 $ ] and their @xmath45 takes any value under the solid line .",
    "concerning stars , we see that most of them are found at @xmath59  kpc , where they form a central compact relaxed structure , i.e. , a bulge , with @xmath60 without any preferred direction and very low @xmath45 ; in some dlos , as figs .",
    "[ dlos](a )  and  [ dlos](b ) illustrate , some stars are placed at @xmath61  kpc in some orderly fashion , forming a sort of thick disc .",
    "baryons forming other dlos in our sample follow similar behaviour patterns .    in fig .",
    "[ jmvsm ] we plot the specific total angular momentum at @xmath0 versus mass for dark haloes , @xmath62 ( open symbols ) , for the inner 83 per cent of the disc gas mass ( i.e. , the mass fraction enclosed by @xmath63 in a purely exponential disc , where @xmath64 is the disc scale length , see @xmath3[budi ] ) , @xmath65 ( filled symbols ) , and for the stellar component of the dlos in our simulations , @xmath66 ( starred symbols ) .",
    "we see that @xmath65 is of the same order as @xmath62 , so that these gas particles have collapsed conserving , on average , their angular momentum .",
    "moreover , dlos formed in our simulations are inside the box defined by observed spiral discs in this plot ( fall 1983 ) .",
    "in contrast , @xmath66 is much smaller than either @xmath62 or @xmath65 , meaning that the stellar component in the central parts has formed out of gas that had lost an important amount of its angular momentum .",
    "a detailed description of the physical processes leading to dlo configuration at @xmath0 we have just described is given in domnguez - tenreiro et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and tsdt . here",
    "these processes are only briefly summarized :    the net effect of shocks and cooling in the quiescent phases of evolution on disordered halo gas particles , is that they force them to a coherent rotation with global specific angular momentum conservation .",
    "consequently , in the quiescent phases of the evolution , gas particles tend to settle at the inner halo regions , and if the gravitational potential has some centre of axial ( or central ) symmetry at these regions , gas particles will move on a plane on circular orbits around this centre , forming a cold thin disc .",
    "most stars in the central bulges have been formed out of gas particles that had been involved in an inflow event with high @xmath1 loss ; these compact central bulges create a gravitational potential that is spherically symmetric on scales of a few kpc , ensuring @xmath1 conservation .",
    "this stabilizes the system against gas inflows in future violent phases of the evolution .",
    "in fact , in the next major merger event , those gas particles involved in the merger and with high @xmath1 will be placed on an intermediate disc ; in their turn , the stellar bulge of the smaller dlo involved in the event is eventually destroyed by strong tidal forces ; then , incomplete orbital angular momentum loss puts most of its stars at some distance of the centre , where , after some relaxation , they form a kind of thick disc .",
    "finally , most of the disc external gas particles are supplied by infall of particles , either belonging to baryonic clumps ( satellites ) or diffuse component , completing the dlo assembly .",
    "because of the sf implementation used , gas in discs are not transformed into stars .",
    "then , simulated discs are mostly composed of gas . observed discs in spirals",
    "are mostly stellar , but the stellar discs inherit the structural and dynamical characteristics of the gaseous discs out of which disc stars have formed , so that , for the sake of comparison , the value of the parameters describing those properties can be safely determined from the simulated gaseous discs .",
    "a proper implementation of star formation with supernovae feedback should lead to a self - regulated star formation that would allow the formation of both compact stellar bulges and thin stellar discs .",
    "observationally , the structural parameters of spirals are obtained from a fit to the shape of the surface _ brightness _ profile .",
    "the galaxy luminosity profile is often decomposed into a bulge ( b ) and disc ( d ) component , such as @xmath67    each individual profile can be modelled using the parametrization from srsic ( 1968 ) , @xmath68 ,",

    "the de  vaucouleurs profile for spheroids corresponds to a choice of @xmath71 .",
    "@xmath72 and @xmath73 are the central surface brightness and scale length for the bulge and disc components .",
    "the same profile form has been fit to the projected _ mass _ density of baryons , @xmath74 , for the dlos in our sample .",
    "@xmath74 is calculated by averaging concentric rings centred at the centre of mass of each dlo .",
    "projections on the plane normal to the total angular momentum of each dlo ( disc plane ) have been used .",
    "these projected densities are binning dependent and somewhat noisy . to circumvent these problems , the _",
    "integrated projected _ mass density in concentric cylinders of radius @xmath50 and mass @xmath75 , @xmath76 has been used as fitting function , instead of the projected mass density itself .",
    "cumulative histograms @xmath77 are constructed by adding equal height steps at those positions @xmath78 where baryon particles are placed .",
    "[ mcyl ] shows these @xmath79 histograms for two dlos .",
    "simulated discs , as well as discs observed in spirals , do not have a sharp end .",
    "we have taken as maximum limiting radius for the simulated discs @xmath80 . ] which corresponds to a limiting or truncation radius in surface brightness of @xmath81 mag arcsec@xmath82 assuming that discs have @xmath83 mag arcsec@xmath82 .",
    "as minimum limiting radius we have taken @xmath84  kpc .",
    "these changes affect mainly the @xmath85 parameter values , that in the less favoured case , @xmath86  kpc , change on average only by less than a 10 per cent ; @xmath64 variations , on the other hand , are on average lower than the corresponding monte carlo errors due to finite sampling ( see fig .",
    "[ rbrd ] ) . ] .",
    "because the total baryon number inside @xmath39 for each object is known ( see table  [ general ] ; this is equivalent to knowing the _ total _ dlo mass ) , we are left with four free fitting parameters among @xmath69 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 and @xmath64 .",
    "an updated version of the minuit software from cern library has been used to make the fits .    to compare the size of bulges with different shape (",
    "i.e. , with different bulge shape parameter @xmath69 ) the @xmath88 parameter is meaningless because its value , as determined from the fitting procedure , depends on @xmath69 .",
    "in fact , when bulges with the same physical scale and different shape are considered , @xmath88 varies by orders of magnitude when @xmath69 varies by a factor of some few units ( see eqs .",

    "for comparison , table  [ buldis ] also gives the disc scale length and the @xmath100 per degree of freedom for a de  vaucouleurs profile ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "note that the disc scale parameter , @xmath64 , is , in most cases , nearly independent of the bulge shape parameter ( either @xmath98 , @xmath70 or @xmath71 ) .",

    "most dlos have been found to have sub - maximal discs ; only two of them have been found to lie inside the 95 per cent confidence interval for maximum discs according to sackett ( 1997 ) .",
    "the previous agreement also shows that the amount of baryon mass that has ended up inside @xmath203 is not excessive , again as a consequence of @xmath1 conservation .",
    "4 .   the @xmath191 parameter ratio is a measure of the relative amount of dark matter at the inner dlo zones .",

    "this may be a consequence of the strongly concentrated mass distribution of dark haloes in standard cdm scenarios .",
    "a concern is in order regarding numerical resolution .",
    "dlos are resolved with a relatively low number of particles .",
    "in contrast , dark matter haloes are described with a much better resolution .",
    "an inappropriate low gas resolution would result in an unphysical gas heating that could halt the gas collapse ( navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "however , some works suggest that it is an inadequate resolution in the dark matter halo component that may produce the larger undesired numerical artifacts ( steinmetz & white 1997 ) .",
    "in fact , it appears that a well - resolved dark matter halo , even if the number of gas particles is lower ( but more than , say , one hundred ) , gives rise to a well - represented ( or well - resolved ) gas density profile , being this point the most important for both the hydrodynamics and the tracking of the star formation history .",
    "moreover , to make sure that the populated and extended discs in the simulations do not result from unphysical gas heating or smoothing , we have run a higher resolution simulation ( @xmath5 particles in a periodic box of 5  mpc , with cosmological and star formation parameters similar to those in s1 , s1b and s1c ; hereafter hrs ) .",

    "the comparison between dlos produced in our simulations and observational data allows us to affirm that they have counterparts in the real world .",
    "this agreement suggests that the process operating in fall & efstathiou ( 1980 ) standard model for disc formation ( i.e. , gas cooling and collapse with specific angular momentum , @xmath1 , conservation ) is also at work in the _ quiescent _ phases of dlo formation in these simulations , resulting in discs with exponential density profiles , as predicted by dalcanton et al .",

    "( 1998 ) and siz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) it is shown that _",
    "violent _ episodes ( i.e. , interaction and merger events ) also occur and play an important role in dlo assembly . in particular",
