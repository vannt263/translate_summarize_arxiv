    "the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is the gas and dust which permeates the space between galaxies in our universe .",
    "the igm is inferred to be the dominant repository of baryons in our universe ; it provides the fuel for galaxies and serves as a ` sink ' for the metals they expel .",
    "the igm is almost exclusively observed through absorption - line techniques in the spectra of distant objects , e.g.  quasars , gamma - ray bursts .",
    "the so - called  forest , for example , is the thicket of absorption lines which trace modest overdensities in the universe .    despite its name , which suggests a disconnect from galaxies , the igm exhibits several characteristics which connect it to them .",
    "chief among these is the presence of metals , generally in the form of highly - ionized species like , , and absorption .",
    "the medium is too diffuse and ionized to support _ in situ _ star - formation , therefore it is expected that these metals were produced within galaxies and transported by one or more mechanisms to the igm ( e.g.  galactic - scale winds , tidal stripping ) . identifying the timing , the processes , and the precise interplay between galaxies and",
    "the igm remains a very active area of current astrophysical research ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for several decades",
    "now , researchers have surveyed the fields surrounding bright quasars with the goal of connecting galaxies that they discover to specific characteristics of the igm ( as revealed by rest - frame uv spectroscopy of the quasars ) .",
    "these include surveys to explore the association of galaxies to the  forest @xcite ; searches for galaxies related to strong lines @xcite ; and studies of the structures giving rise to absorption @xcite .",
    "the latter ion has received considerable attention because it has been proposed to trace the @xmath11k phase of the igm , termed the warm - hot intergalactic medium ( whim ) .",
    "although the whim is a generic prediction of cosmological simulations @xcite , its low density and modest temperature make it especially elusive to empirical detection .",
    "the doublet , however , has been extensively surveyed and owing to its high ionization state may track a portion of the whim .",

    "these distributions are a complex convolution of the magnitude limit and angular extent of the survey fields , and the emission redshift distribution of the targeted quasars .",
    "for example , the impact parameter distribution does not scale as @xmath169 because the fixed angular extent of the survey restricts galaxies to @xmath170mpc at @xmath171 .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig : summary ] provides an overview of this survey s utility for probing the low @xmath1 igm .    to crudely assess the completeness and global characteristics of the survey",

    "the maximum redshift was imposed to minimize effects from having targeted fields with a known , luminous quasar and also to facilitate comparison with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",

    "we have also performed a jack - knife analysis of the survey and recover similar scatter in the measurements albeit with a bias toward lower values .",
    "we have also attempted to correct for incompleteness in the survey , using two approaches .",
    "the blue stars in the figure include a completeness correction estimated by scaling @xmath182 in each field by its corresponding completeness , i.e.@xmath183 .",
    "this increases @xmath162 in nearly every bin by @xmath184 , i.e.  the correction is essentially independent of apparent magnitude . as figure  [ fig : mag_complete ] demonstrates , however , the survey has higher incompleteness for fainter galaxies .",
    "therefore , we have used the results given in figure  [ fig : mag_complete ] to increment the contribution of each galaxy to @xmath162 according to each galaxy s apparent magnitude .",
    "these results are shown as the cyan diamonds in figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] .    overplotted on our evaluations of @xmath162 are the luminosity functions derived for the @xmath64-band from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite , transformed to our assumed cosmology ( e.g.  @xmath163 ) .",
    "the agreement between our evaluation and the sdss estimations is remarkably good .",
    "the only significant deviation is at the bright - end where we have detected 2@xmath185 more galaxies than predicted by the sdss luminosity functions .",
    "the offset could be the result of an eddington bias in our estimation of @xmath162 and/or a modest offset between our @xmath7-band photometry and the sdss @xmath64-band ( there is one notable for some of these galaxies which are also observed by sdss ) .",
    "we also emphasize that the number of galaxies in these deviant bins is small ( @xmath186 ; upper panel of figure  [ fig : lumfunc ] ) .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that our combined survey provides a reasonably representative sample of galaxies for low-@xmath1 igm analysis .    in future papers ( e.g.  prochaska et al .",
