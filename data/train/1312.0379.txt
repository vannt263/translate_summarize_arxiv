    "topological insulators ( tis ) are novel materials in which even though the bulk system is insulating , the surface can support spin - polarized gapless states with dirac - cone - like linear energy dispersion.@xcite the topological surface states are unique in being robust against scattering from non - magnetic impurities , and display spin - momentum locking , which results in helical spin textures .",
    "@xcite tis not only offer exciting possibilities for applications in spintronics , energy and information technologies , but also provide platforms for exploring in a solid state setting questions which have traditionally been considered to lie in the realm of high energy physics , such as the weyl semimetal phases and the higgs mechanism.@xcite    two dimensional ( 2d ) topological insulators , also referred to as the quantum spin hall ( qsh ) insulators , were predicted theoretically , before being realized experimentally in hgte / cdte quantum wells.@xcite the three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis were identified later in bismuth - based thermoelectrics , bi@xmath1sb@xmath0 , bi@xmath2se@xmath5 , bi@xmath2te@xmath5 , and sb@xmath2te@xmath5,@xcite although transport properties of these binary tis are dominated by intrinsic vacancies and disorder in the bulk material . by",

    "a topological phase transition ( tpt ) from a trivial to a non - trivial topological phase in 2d is an interesting unexplored issue , although in 3d a tpt has been demonstrated in tlbi(se , s)@xmath2 solid solutions.@xcite despite the theoretical prediction for the existence of nontrivial 2d tis in this family of materials@xcite , no experimental realization has been reported , which may be due to stronger bonding in the tl - compounds compared to the weaker van der waals type bonding between quintuple layers in the bi@xmath2se@xmath5 family .",
    "interestingly , rhombohedral sb@xmath2se@xmath5 has been predicted to be a trivial insulator , implying that a tpt could be realized in ( bi@xmath1sb@xmath6)@xmath2se@xmath5 solid solutions .",
    "however , the real sb@xmath2se@xmath5 material exhibits an orthorhombic structure , and a structural phase transition intervenes before the tpt point is reached , as the sb concentration increases .",
    "these considerations suggest that a strategy for realizing a thin - film material exhibiting a 2d tpt is to begin with an existing 3d topological material in which the layers are weakly bonded and trivial and non - trivial topological phases can be achieved without encountering a structural instability . here",
    "we recall that gebi@xmath2te@xmath3 ( gbt124 ) was theoretically predicted @xcite and experimentally verified@xcite as a 3d ti , but gesb@xmath2te@xmath3 ( gst124 ) is predicted @xcite to be a trivial insulator with a large bulk band - gap .",

    "in particular , the dirac point in gbt124 , for example , is well isolated from the bulk bands,@xcite while it lies very close to the valence band maximum or it is buried in the bulk bands in bi@xmath2te@xmath5/bi@xmath2se@xmath5 . along this",
