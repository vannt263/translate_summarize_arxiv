    "in 2015 the world celebrates 100 years of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "einstein discovered gr while trying to generalize the theory of special relativity to non - inertial and accelerating frames . in this new theory physics was invariant under ` general coordinate transformations ' including transformations to frames of accelerated observers .",
    "simultaneously as gr quantum mechanics ( qm ) was being developed as a theory of the atomic and molecular regime .",
    "initially the theory of qm was formulated using ` galilean ' invariant schrdinger equation .",
    "the qm for inertial or constant velocity frames , which respected the laws of einstein s special theory of relativity was formulated much later .",
    "quantum field theory ( qft ) was developed initially by dirac @xcite and then in the 1950 s and 1960 s by various physicists who generalized quantum mechanics for relativistically invariant systems @xcite .",
    "the obvious question which follows is what is qft in accelerated frames , and how does one reconcile this with gravity as gr ?",
    "can this lead to the formulation of a quantum gr ?",
    "this has been a notoriously difficult task @xcite , however , our perspective is that the clues for a quantum gr theory are hidden in qft for accelerated observers . in this paper",
    "we investigate qft for accelerated observers using a formulation in complex physics due to prigogine @xcite , and try to obtain some insights from the formulation for a quantum theory of gr .",
    "we begin by re - investigating an accelerated observer in minkowski space - time , where the physics is well understood .",
    "an accelerated observer s frame of reference is described using the rindler coordinates @xcite . in this frame",
    ", the minkowski causal diamond appears as causally disconnected into two rindler universes with time flowing in the forward direction in one universe and reverse direction in the other .",
    "an accelerating observer restricted to one rindler universe sees the minkowski vacuum as a state with particles distributed in a thermal spectrum with a temperature proportional to his / her proper acceleration .",
    "this can be observed by obtaining the creation and annihilation operators of the rindler qft s as linear transforms of the minkowski operators @xcite .",
    "the transformation known as the bogoliubov transformation can also be implemented on the vacuum states .",
    "we formalize these transformations , and obtain them as non - unitary operators which act on the density matrices of the minkowski space - time .",
    "the density matrices of two rindler hilbert spaces ( one with time flowing forward and the other with time flowing backward ) are obtained using this and the individual operators of the rindler hilbert space are also obtained using non - unitary transformations .",
    "we find that these ` formalized ' transformations have been previously studied in physics of irreversible systems due to prigogine @xcite .",
    "i. prigogine @xcite had reformulated complex physics , where systems are characterized by thermalization and irreversible time evolution using new ` star - hermitian ' operators .",
    "these were non - unitary operators , and ` star - hermitian ' is an operation which in addition to hermitian conjugation involves time reversal .",
    "curiously these operators were defined by implementing a linear transform from density matrices of normal ` unitary ' hilbert space to density matrices of an irreversible system . in the transformed hilbert space",
    "the time evolution is not unitary and ` entropy ' production occurs due to presence of an anti - hermitian term in the star hermitian evolution operator .",
    "the presence of entropy and irreversibility in the transformed hilbert space is identified by building a lyapunov function which decreases in any physical process .",
    "we show that each of the the rindler vacuum density matrix is a very similar ` non - unitary ' operator transform of the minkowski vacuum density matrix : the operators are non - unitary .",
    "the time evolution equation in the ` rindler ' hilbert - space is non - unitary and we construct a lyapunov function for the rindler observer and show that this has irreversible behavior , signifying the existence of ` entropy ' .",
    "however , what is interesting is that unlike the systems discussed in @xcite , the transformation connects hilbert spaces of two different coordinate systems , with two different times .",
    "thus , if we flow the lyapunov function in minkowski time , there is no entropy creation .",
    "if instead we flow the lyapunov function using the rindler hamiltonian , there is monotonic flow .",
    "we also clarify some of the criticisms of prigogine s formalism by providing a very concrete and transparent system for its implementation .",
    "in particular , for the rindler system , we show that the initial unitary hilbert space is mapped to two different hilbert spaces by two versions of the prigogine transformation .",
    "one hilbert space has the time as reverse of the time of the other hilbert space .",
    "irreversibility arises in one hilbert space due to the ignorance of one of the hilbert spaces , and choosing one of the prigogine transformation over the other , representing unidirectional time flow .",
    "we then generalize the above formalism to the case of the black hole space - time .",
    "the near horizon region of the black hole has the same metric as that of the rindler observer .",
    "the bifurcate horizon disconnects two asymptotics ( i and ii as in figure 2 ) , which play the same role as two rindler universes .",
    "the kruskal vacuum of the @xcite of the space - time plays the role of the minkowski vacuum and a transformation of this to the individual i and ii rindler vacuums is derived as a prigogine transformation .",
    "the black hole space - time is different from the minkowski space - time , as it has black hole and white hole regions , where matter can propagate in one direction only , into the black hole and out of the black hole .",
    "this gives the entropy of the black hole a real existence ` independent of observer ' as opposed to minkowski - rindler example , but induced due to boundary conditions .",
    "having formulated two different examples of qft as observed by accelerating observers , we finally formulate a general theory of transforms of quantum density matrices of qft from inertial to non - inertial frames , and discuss the implications of this .",
    "for other discussions / derivations on rindler space - time thermodynamics see @xcite and for discussions on accelerated frames see @xcite and references therein . in the next discussion",
    "we describe the formulation due to prigogine for physics of complex systems and the star - hermitian operators .",
    "we introduce the generic quantum field theory vacuum and discuss the transformation to the rindler vacuum in the second section . in the third section we formalize these transformations as prigogine transformations . in this section",
    "we also construct the lyapunov function and the time evolution which shows irreversible behavior in the rindler frame . the fourth section deals with accelerating observer near a black hole horizon .",
    "the fifth section generalizes qft for accelerating frames using the connection to the prigogine transformation .",
    "the sixth section is a conclusion .",
    "nature is inherently complex , and systems evolve irreversibly . in physics we idealize and isolate systems and formulate reversible , unitary laws describing the dynamics . in reality",
    "synergistic behavior of systems comprised of many fundamental entities is prevalent in natural phenomena .",
    "a typical system is the ` ideal gas ' consisting of molecules whose individual dynamics is reversible and unitary but collectively they are ` thermalized ' and possess entropy .",
    "it is generally agreed that ` entropy ' arises due to loss of information of the system , and irreversibility results due to ` random interactions ' amongst the constituents which introduces a degree of unpredictability in the system .",
    "the origin of ` entropy ' and unidirectional time evolution was initiated from boltzmann s h - theorem @xcite . since then variations of the h - theorem have tried to re - interpret the origin of entropy .",
    "one such attempt is due to prigogine whose ideas tried to bring to the physics of complex systems the concept of microscopic entropy . in a very fundamental formulation of irreversible systems , he introduced operators which transformed density matrices of a typical hilbert space into density matrices of a hilbert space whose time evolution had irreversible behavior .",
    "in the transformed hilbert space the time evolution equation was non - unitary @xcite .",
    "there is a very subtle difference between the usual ` thermalization process ' where the irreversibility emerges in the macroscopic averaging process , and the irreversibility of the prigogine formulation , here irreversibility is introduced using a non - unitary transform from a unitary hilbert space in the quantum regime , and thus microscopic in origin .    in the following we give a very brief and cryptic description of the formulation . for further details",
    "refer to @xcite .",
    "let us take a system which is described using a density matrix @xmath0 and its dynamics is described using a hamiltonian .",
    "this density matrix @xmath0 evolves in time using the liouville operator l , obtained as the commutator of the hamiltonian h with the density matrix .",
    "= [ h,]= l[eq : liou ] this is typical in a quantum mechanical system , and if the hamiltonian is hermitian , the evolution is unitary .",
    "however , a non - unitary irreversible flow can be obtained by defining a ` transform ' from the above density matrix .",
    "this is implemented using a non - unitary operator @xmath1 , which is a function of the liouville operator l. = ^-1(l ) [ eqn : transformation ] the @xmath1 operator is such that it obeys ^-1(l)=^(-l ) [ eqn : star ]    this is motivated from the requirement that expectation values of observables remain same in both the representations of the hilbert space .",
    "( a^ ) = tr(a^ ) where the observable transforms as @xmath2 .",
    "notice , the interesting @xmath3 in the argument of the @xmath1 operator .",
    "this operation can be interpreted as the ` time - reversal ' operation as obviously in equation ( [ eq : liou ] ) the @xmath4 implements @xmath3 . this time reversal accompanied with hermitian",
    "conjugation defines the ` star hermitian ' operation : ^*=^(-l ) thus we can see that we can write equation ( [ eqn : star ] ) as ^-1= ^*.    the transformed evolution equation which evolves the transformed @xmath5 matrix is thus :   =  where @xmath6 .",
    "the resultant evolution operator can be written as a star hermitian operator as ^*= ^(-l)=-(l ) or (   ) ^*=  this ` star hermitian operator ' can be written as the sum of a hermitian and a anti - hermitian operator .",
    "=   _ e+  _ o  the entropy production comes from the ` even ' part of the operator @xmath7 , it can be shown that this term is similar to the collision term in boltzmann s h - theorem .",
    "for further information in this field there are papers describing the friedrich s model in condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "lyapunov functions are well defined in mathematics @xcite , for studying stability of systems .",
    "they can be defined as positive definite functions whose derivatives have monotonic behaviour with asymptotic stability . in physics",
    "these are used for systems to describe entropy which ` always ' increases with time .",
    "further the system acquires equilibrium in the maximum entropy state . in the prigogine formalism",
    ", lyapunov functions can be defined in the transformed space e.g. = tr(^ ) using the density matrix obtained in ( [ eqn : transformation ] ) .",
    "the time derivative of this = where @xmath8 .",
    "is non - zero , as the liouville operator does not usually commute with @xmath9 operator .",
    "defining @xmath10 as the super operator @xmath11 , one finds = -tr  ^e^i lt i  ( m  l - l  m)e^-ilt(0 ) 0 + in @xcite the operator ml - lm = d is defined as the entropy operator and measures the ` irreversibility ' of the system .",
    "the significance is in the non - commuting terms ( ml - lm ) which gives rise to irreversible flow .    in the next section",
    "we describe the quantum state of an accelerated observer as obtained from the minkowski state motivated from this formulation , and obtain precisely such an irreversible flow of the rindler vacuum .",
    "the existence of lyapunov functions with asymptotic stability , give rise to entropy creation in a system @xcite .",
    "in this section we explore the quantum field theory of an accelerated observer in minkowski space .",
    "it is well known that there is particle creation in the frame of an accelerated observer @xcite and we examine this in the formalism introduced in the previous section .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the quantum field in minkowski space - time .",
    "the minkowski space is flat and the metric of the space - time in cartesian coordinates is ds^2=-dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 [ eqn : minkowski ] most of pre - general relativity physics and quantum mechanics as well as quantum field theory is formulated in minkowski space .",
    "we take the example of the simplest field : the scalar field to illustrate the transform from the inertial observer to the accelerated observer . defining a scalar quantum field using a lorentz invariant action of the form @xcite",
    "-12 d^4 x  ( _ ^-m^2 ^2 ) [ eqn : action ] where @xmath12 is the mass of the scalar field @xmath13 ( which is taken as real ) one obtains the dynamics .",
    "the scalar data is given on a cauchy surface and evolved in the minkowski space - time using the appropriate equation of motion .",
    "the inner product of the scalar fields on a hyper surface of the minkowski space is defined as = _",
    "d^ ( _ _ 1^ * _ 2 - _ 1^*__2 ) [ inner ] the quantization of the field in the fock space representation proceeds by identifying the positive frequency modes defined as conjugate to the ` time coordinate ' of the background field .",
    "the hamiltonian defined canonically using this background time measures the quanta of these positive frequency modes .",
    "the ` creation ' and ` annihilation ' operators for these modes defined using the canonical momenta and the position vectors ` factorize ' the hamiltonian , and the field configuration is defined using these operators .",
    "the positive frequency solutions are identified with respect to time as = -i  using the ( [ inner ] ) inner product , one can normalize the wave function . the ` mode ' solution",
    "is obtained as = e^- i   t + i  k.x    where the vector @xmath14 is the momentum vector and the dispersion relation is ^2 -k^2 = m^2 we shall set @xmath15 in the rest of the paper .",
    "the quantum of these normal modes are created and annihilated by operators @xmath16 which appear in the description of the hamiltonian .",
    "d^3 k   : a^ _ , k   a _ , k :    a typical ` quantum ' configuration of the scalar field is then    =    it is obvious from this that    = a _ , k and = - a^ _ , k    the vacuum state of the theory is a unique vacuum and it is defined as the state with no quanta . and the annihilation operator annihilates the vacuum . a _ ,   k  |0_m>=0 the modes with energy @xmath17 and momentum vector @xmath14 can be created out of the vacuum using @xmath18 .",
    "these modes begin at the far past and propagate to the far future .",
    "however , for the massless modes , the minkowski scalar fields are best described using the causal diamond .",
    "the scalar fields travel along light like geodesics from one asymptotic past to the other asymptotic future .",
    "there are two sets of asymptotics .",
    "the light cone coordinates are defined as :    v= t+x       u= t - x    and correspondingly we define @xmath19 as the light cone momenta coordinates . the light cone creation and annihilation operators are obtained by making the following transformations   a _ , k=  a_k_v     where we have defined the light cone mode as @xmath20 . k_v= -k_x",
    "k_u= + k_x    @xmath21 are the coordinates perpendicular to the light cone directions .",
    "we define the above modes on a @xmath22 constant surface .",
    "the v = constant and u = constant surfaces are defined at 45@xmath23 angles to the t - x axes and the wavefronts propagate along these .",
    "the time reversed minkowski modes will become important in the following discussion .",
    "we will specifically work with the @xmath24 surface as in @xcite and on this surface , the scalar field will be ( u , * x*)=   d^2 * k *  ( a_k_v * k * e^-i k_v u + i * k**x * * * + a^ _ k_v * k *   e^ i k_v u - i * k**x * * * ) the time reversed version of this @xmath25 will also be used to describe the rindler modes , and the corresponding annihilation and creation operators @xmath26 of this will be defined for this purpose .",
    "what is interesting is that to obtain the complete transformation from the minkowski to the rindler space , we require two sets of modes minkowski modes ; @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this interpretation of the modes as creator of forward and backward light cone travelers serves the purpose of the prigogine formalism .",

    "the @xmath0 constant rindler observers describe hyperbolic paths @xmath31 constant paths in minkowski space and are the world - lines of accelerating observers . given the above metric , we describe the quantum field as observed by the rindler observer .    as we described in equations ( [ eqn : boost],[eqn : metric ] ) , an accelerating observer does not observe the entire space - time .",
    "his / her view is obscured by the presence of rindler horizons , the @xmath32 axes of the minkowski space - time .",
    "one can still define quantum field theory in the two wedges which comprise the rindler space - time , separately .",

    "however the solutions are valid in either the rindler wedge i or ii ( see figure 1 ) .",

    "e^/a  =    in region i @xmath22 is positive , therefore the derivative is positive and @xmath33 increases with @xmath45 . in region",
    "ii @xmath22 is negative and thus @xmath33 decreases with @xmath45 .",
    "thus time in one wedge is negative of the time in the other wedge . motivated from @xcite",
    ", we use the v=0 surface as an almost cauchy surface to analyse the transformations from rindler to minkowski modes . at the @xmath24 surface from ( [ eqn : boost ] ) , the coordinate @xmath36 , and thus one uses the approximation to the bessel functions around @xmath36 .",
    "on the @xmath24 surface as @xmath46 , the scalar fields from both the rindler wedges i and ii contribute to the scalar data on the surface . for @xmath47 the rindler modes for wedge ii are analytically continued into the @xmath24 surface , similarly for @xmath48 .",
    "thus the field & = & d   d^2 * k *   [   e^-i  e^i * k x * ( )  a _ ii + e^i  e^- i * kx*^ * ( )  a^ _ ii   ]     u>0 + & = & d  d^2 * k *   [ e^-i e^i * k x * ( )  a _",

    "for the other half of the v - axis , one uses & = &   d   d^2 * k *   as it is obvious that @xmath50 and @xmath51 , one obtains ignoring the @xmath22 = constant terms = d  d^2 * k * @xmath47 and = d  d^2 * k * for @xmath48 .",
    "the above can be fourier transformed to the minkowski modes @xmath52 .",

    "these transformations have been explicitly worked out in several other papers @xcite , this is a re - working of those to fix notations etc .",
    "it is obvious from the fourier transforms that the above represent ` positive ' frequency modes and the operators annihilation of these modes .",

    "it is known that for correlation functions , euclideanisation of the time coordinate is required to obtain the thermal character of the field @xcite .    though there is somewhat strange falacious argument , given that if we had e^- i h_r i |0_ri>= |0_ri ( ) > instead of u e^-i",

    "however , unlike the minkowski diamond example , the time reversed modes of the scalar field in the kruskal extension donot exist",
    ". thus causal structure of the black hole imposes new boundary conditions which ensure that the kruskal space - time has entropy .",

    "the penrose diagram for this is shown in the figure , and the two asymptotics are labeled as i and ii . this is analogous to the minkowski causal diamond penrose diagram , and represents the maximal extension of the schwarzschild space - time . thus one can directly see why this physical example is similar to the minkowski - rindler discussion of the thermalization .",
    "we begin with the schwarzschild metric and derive the kruskal extension .",
    "the schwarzschild metric is given in @xmath91 coordinates as ds^2= - ( 1- ) dt^2 + ( 1-)^-1 dr^2 + r^2 d    @xmath92 is the angular metric , @xmath93 is the radial coordinate , @xmath11 the mass of the metric .",
    "the vector @xmath94 obviously generates isometries , and is thus a killing vector .",
    "the norm of the killing vector @xmath95 is 0 at @xmath96 and this locates the horizons .",
    "it is interesting that near the horizon , as @xmath97 the metric is rindler , and thus the discussion smoothly connects with the previous section about the rindler observer .",
    "given @xmath98 , the metric can be re - written as ds^2 & = & - ( r - 2gm ) dt^2 +  dr^2 + r^2 d + ds^2 & = & - dt^2 + d ^2 + 4g^2 m^2 d    and thus the scalar wave function is easy to map to the wave function of ( [ eqn : sol ] ) .",
    "as is evident there as @xmath99 , the scalar wave function is of the form ( [ eqn : near ] ) .",
    "thus the observer at the horizon is ` accelerating ' with an acceleration at @xmath100 .",
    "the ` minkowski ' coordinates at the horizon is obtained by defining the kruskal extension of the schwarzschild space - time .",
    "the horizon is smooth in these coordinates .",
    "the scalar wave - function can be solved in these coordinates : - _ t^2 + _ ( _ ) + _ ( _ ) + ^2_=0 the above equation can be solved using the ansatz = e^- i   ty_lm where we have taken @xmath101 , the radial equation reduces to : ^2 + + = 0 this is solved by = a_i j_4 i gm ( 2 i k ) + b_i y_4 i gm ( 2 i k ) with @xmath102 .",

    "however , this time flows backwards , and thus we use the change @xmath106 before transforming this to the u , v coordinates : ^ii a_ii   e^ i  t + i  2gm   y_lm + b_ii  e^i  t -i  2gm   y_lm + c.c .    to define the wave function in coordinates across the horizon , we use the following    the kruskal coordinates are defined by u & = & - e^-u/4gm + v & = & e^v/4gm        the above coordinates simulate the lightcone ` minkowski coordinates ' , and represent light - like geodesics .",

    "we have to find the normal modes of the scalar field , and achieve the transformation to the rindler versions .",

    "ds^2 = -32 ( gm)^3 du dv + r^2 d[eqn : kruskal ]    in this coordinate the metric is smooth at @xmath96 , the metric in the @xmath107 sector is conformal to minkowski space , and the location of the past horizon is v=0 and future horizon is u=0 .",
    "exactly in analogy to the rindler observers s space - time , the u=0 and the v=0 axes separate the entire space - time into four regions labeled as i , ii , iii , iv . the regions i and ii have the asymptotics , @xmath108 and are causally disconnected from each other .",
    "the regions iii and iv include the @xmath109 curvature singularities .",
    "these are regions of the ` black hole ' and the ` white hole ' .",
    "matter falls into the black hole region iii disappearing into the singularity and matter is emergent from the singularity escaping to the outside from the white hole region iv .",
    "the ` white hole ' and the ` black hole ' regions require that the scalar field flows in one direction only in these regions , and thus the time reversed modes used in the example of minkowski space @xmath110 can not exist in these regions .",
    "we begin with the qft as in the previous case defined on one of the horizons , taken as an almost cauchy surface : in this example the v=0 surface , or the past horizon .",
    "exactly as in the rindler example , we take the almost cauchy surface @xmath111 and write a typical quantum field , expanded in the modes of the given regions i and ii and transform to the kruskal coordinates which ` connects ' the two regions .",

    "thus , in the wkb or geometric optics approximation the kruskal modes at the horizon are @xmath116 .",
    "as is evident the wave function in the rindler metric is of the for given as ( [ eqn : wave ] ) . thus ^i & = &   d  [ a_i   e^i  ue^+r + 2gm 2gm + b_i   e^i  ve^-r - 2gm 2gm + c.c . ]",

    "l -m  i^ + _ lm & = & a_l m  ii + e^- 4gm a_l -m i^ and their complex conjugates .        where @xmath126 .",
    "exactly as in the example of minkowski @xmath127 rindler transformations , the dictionary can be built , of the map of the operators and density matrices . in this case",
    ", however we make the interesting observation that due to the presence of the white whole and the black hole regions , on the v=0 surface , the @xmath55 modes do not exist .",
    "thus , when we define the map from the rindler vaccum to the minkowski vacuum , or the map from the schwarzschild observer to the kruskal observer , only one set of time forward modes are picked up .",
    "this induces a thermalization which does not happen in minkowski space - time .",
    "as the @xmath55 modes donot exist , we can only deal with density matrices and trace over the @xmath55 modes of the system . in the usual framework of the ` tracing mechanism ' for determining entropy of quantum states ; as |0_ri>= _",
    "e^- ^_l m ^_l m|>|>=__n ( -)^n |>| > [ eqn : minvacc ]    the system is in the direct product space of the forward and time reversed modes .",

    "note that in this example , the boundary conditions ensure that @xmath128 modes do not exist .",
    "this makes this state thermalized ab initio .",
    "one does nt have to use rindler time to find the entropic behavior .",
    "the other derivations of the section on minkowski - rindler space - time would be exactly the same for the kruskal - rindler transformations too : e.g. a_l m   i = u _  l   mu^-1        a _",
    "l m  ii= u_l",
    "m u^-1    this permits the evaluation of @xmath129 as in ( [ eqn : timev ] ) , and the anti - hermitian term is similar in origin for the hawking radiation as observed in @xcite , when we trace over the @xmath130 modes . in a collapsing situation , both the @xmath55 and the @xmath130 modes donot exist .",
    "based on the observations of the above sections , i try to postulate some generic rules for qft to include accelerated frames / curved space - times .",
    "qft is defined generically as the direct product space of two hilbert spaces which comprises of modes flowing forward and backward in time @xmath131 .",
    "+ 2 . in case of accelerated observers , the two hilbert spaces ( time forward and time backwards ) are defined in space - time regions separated by a bifurcate horizon .",
    "the star - unitary operator @xmath132 and the star - hermitian operators @xmath133 are important for qft in accelerated frames .",
    "the @xmath132 operators map the density matrices of the inertial frame to the accelerated observers frame .",
    "the @xmath1 operator maps to minkowski density matrices to density matrices in @xmath134 and a second @xmath1 operator maps the minkowski desnity matrices to density matrices of @xmath135 .",
    "irreversible physics emerges if we keep one @xmath1 operator , and one @xmath134 .",
    "the time evolution in the accelerated frame is governed by @xmath133 a star - hermitian operator which allows pure states to evolve into mixed states .",
    "the time evolution in the truncated hilbert space ( @xmath134 or @xmath135 ) might be non - unitary , with plausible entropy creation .",
    "thus we showed that the bogoliubov transformation which maps minkowski vacuum to the vacuum of a rindler observer is a prigogine transformation .",
    "the existence of a lyapunov function shows that the rindler observer perceives irreversibility .",
    "the rindler observer sees one half of a direct product space , one in which time flows forward and the other in which time flows backward .",
    "the prigogine transformation chooses one of the spaces with one time flow , and thus physics for a rindler observer is irreversible .",
    "the transformation which takes the minkowski density matrix to the other rindler hilbert space s density matrix , in this example happens to be identical .",
    "however , it can be labeled as star - unitary operator 2 .",
    "thus there are two prigogine transformations , one which maps to hilbert space in which time is flowing forward , and the other to the hilbert space in which time flows backward . in the rindler example",
    "there is no loss of information , entire information is contained in the direct product of two hilbert spaces ( @xmath136 ) .",
    "mapping to one @xmath137 or @xmath135 gives rise to irreversible physics .",
    "the tracing mechanism , which traces over one of the @xmath134 or @xmath135 basis states when the minkowski state is written in the direct product hilbert space basis is a different from the prigogine map discussed here . the star - unitary operators ` break ' the time reversal symmetry of the direct product space @xmath138 , by projecting the minkowski density matrices defined in the direct product space , to one of the rindler hilbert spaces .",
    "thus this transformation , is ` microscopic ' as implemented on the density matrices , and does not involve a tracing mechanism .",
    "the end result is though the same , the remaining density matrix / quantum state is written in one of the hilbert spaces , @xmath134 or @xmath135 .",
    "this is a concrete example of the implementation of the prigogine formulation , and clarifies the role of the star - unitary operator in a evidently time reversal symmetric system .",
    "there is a breaking of symmetry due to the use of the star - unitary operators .",
    "however , there are two star - unitary operators for each time direction ( in this example the ` time directions ' are represented by @xmath139 and @xmath135 hilbert spaces ) .",
    "this is in agreement with a discussion on the prigogine formalism @xcite .",
    "the same formalism can be used for bifurcate killing horizons where the near horizon observer is accelerating with respect to the background metric .",
    "however for the black hole , additional boundary conditions due to presence of white whole and black hole regions cause thermalisation not present in the minkowski - rindler example .",
    "our eventual aim is to develop a generic qft for accelerated observers , including that which is valid in arbitrary curved space - times . to define quantum field theory in space - times without killing vectors",
    ", one needs to use the formalism of algebraic quantum field theory and hadamard condition @xcite , and this is work in progress @xcite .",
    "one also has to address the problems of interaction of the qft and renormalization in accelerating frames as in @xcite .",
