    "a total of 1297 sources in the 2fgl are either identified through variability or morphology , or reliably associated with counterparts from catalogs of candidate gamma - ray - emitting source classes .",

    "this work studied the sample of unassociated gamma - ray sources in the _",
    "fermi_-lat  2fgl catalog , finding 231 agn candidates based on their gamma - ray properties .",
    "two independent machine - learning algorithms ( random forest and neural networks ) were used to asses the likelihood of each source to be an agn , and intersected to add robustness to the classification method and reduce the number of false associations .",
    "the study includes for the first time an estimate of the _ false - association rate _  that takes into account the differences between associated and unassociated gamma - ray sources .",
    "by evaluating the performance using a test sample weighted in significance and galactic latitude , the obtained 11% _ false - association rate _  can be considered a realistic estimate of the fraction of spurious sources present in the agn - candidate list .",
    "@xcite obtained a lower _ false - association rate _",
    "directly evaluated on the test sample , which is likely an optimistic performance estimate as discussed in section  [ sec : performance ] .",
    "similarly , @xcite used cross - validation on the training sample , which is known to give an optimistic performance , as the same sources used to optimize the classification method are used to calculate the _ false - association rate_.    the list of agn candidates ( table  [ tab : sourcelist ] ) covers the whole sky , studying for the first time the strip that covers the galactic plane , where more than 50% of the unassociated 2fgl sources are located .",
    "about 210 agn are expected at @xmath3 extrapolating from high - latitude observations @xcite , while only 104 are listed in the 2fgl catalog .",
    "even though low - latitude sources are harder to classify , 72 agn candidates were found at @xmath3 ( see figure  [ fig : lat ] ) , which could be a significant fraction of the missing agn close to the galactic plane . at @xmath4 ,",
    "the list of agn candidates is in good agreement with previous work by @xcite .",
    "their study found 60 additional agn candidates , which could be a combination of their method being more sensitive , as it was trained on a cleaner sample of high - latitude sources , and a lower confidence threshold to identify agn candidates .",
    "close to the galactic plane , agn are difficult to identify due to optical extinction and the bright foreground in radio and soft x - rays .",
    "counterpart catalogs are usually incomplete at low latitudes or skip the galactic plane altogether ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "galactic absorption for gamma rays is negligible below 10tev @xcite , making low - latitude agn detectable in the gamma - ray band but difficult to catalog at lower frequencies .",
    "in fact , numerous identifications of agn behind the galactic plane have been triggered by gamma - ray detections at gev @xcite and tev energies @xcite .",
    "the list of 231 candidate agn presented here can not be considered source associations , but only objects likely to be associated with agn . in case of gamma - ray - emitting agn",
    ", detectable levels of non - thermal emission in radio , optical , and x - ray frequencies are expected , and follow - up observations in those bands are needed to unambiguously identify the nature of the gamma - ray emission .",
    "observations in the x - ray band ( 0.2 - 10kev ) have been successful in finding counterparts of unidentified gamma - ray sources ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the angular resolution of x - ray telescopes ( @xmath5 for _ swift_-xrt ) can resolve individual sources inside the typical @xmath6 error box of unassociated 2fgl sources .",
    "follow - up observations in radio and optical spectroscopy of candidate x - ray counterparts can then provide a solid agn identification and spectral class ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the _ swift _ x - ray satellite has observed a good fraction of the 2fgl unassociated sources .",
    "a complete summary of these observations can be found in http://www.swift.psu.edu/unassociated/ @xcite .",
    "so far , 135 out of the 231 candidate agn have at least 2ks of _ swift_-xrt exposure .",
    "a good fraction of these have also been analyzed in @xcite , finding 85 sources with at least one point - like x - ray counterpart .",
    "infrared counterparts with agn - like spectra have been identified for 56 of the agn candidates in the wise all - sky survey @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite presented a multiwavelength study of seven unassociated sources where four agn candidates were investigated and confirmed to have agn - like properties in the radio and x - ray bands .",
    "these counterparts are listed in table  [ tab : sourcelist ] .",
    "counterpart catalogs of gamma - ray - emitting agn candidates are mostly based on the population of agn detected by egret @xcite , that contained a large number of flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq , 71% ) and fewer bl  lac - type objects ( 27% ) .",
    "similar fsrq / bl  lac ratios are found in counterpart catalogs such as _ cgrabs _ ( 84% fsrq/10% bl  lac , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or _ bzcat _",
    "( 54%/39% , * ? ? ?",
    "however , bl  lacs are more numerous than fsrq in the 2fgl catalog ( 34%/40% , see table  [ tab : classes ] ) .",
    "lat - detected bl  lacs have a median radio flux density of 86mjy @xcite , with a low - flux tail extending well below the completeness limit of the _ crates / cgrabs _ catalog ( 65mjy , * ? ? ?",
    "the potential deficit of bl  lacs in counterpart catalogs suggests that a fraction of unassociated 2fgl sources might indeed be bl  lac - type blazars that have not yet been cataloged .",
    "this could become relevant in searches for tev - emitting agn with present ground - based observatories ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and prospects for future installations like cta @xcite , as the harder gamma - ray spectra of bl  lacs favor their detection at tev energies over fsrq .",
    "follow - up studies on the agn candidates presented here will reduce the number of unassociated gamma - ray sources and yield a more complete picture of the characteristics of gamma - ray - loud agn .",
    "additionally , future observations could prove whether the population of gamma - ray - emitting bl  lacs extends to sources with low radio flux density .",
    "if confirmed , gamma - ray emission from bl  lacs with luminosities @xmath7 will give additional information on the low end of bl  lac luminosity function in the gamma - ray band @xcite , which is a key ingredient to estimate their contribution to the isotropic diffuse gamma - ray background @xcite .",
