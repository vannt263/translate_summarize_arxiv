    "lateral quantum dots are defined in a two - dimensional electron gas by means of electrical gates .",
    "@xcite since they are electrostatically defined , lateral quantum dots are extremely tunable .",
    "this advantage is well illustrated by recent achievements involving control over a single electron charge or spin .",
    "experiments have , for example , demonstrated the isolation of single electron in single and double dot systems @xcite , the electrical read - out of a single electron spin @xcite and the coherent manipulation of the charge state of artificial molecules .",
    "@xcite lateral quantum dots therefore provide the ideal choice for related fundamental studies including those aiming at the implementation of solid state quantum bits .",
    "quantum bits can be naturally encoded either using the spin of a single electron trapped in a quantum dot @xcite or alternatively , the charge state of a double quantum dot .",
    "@xcite in both approaches , a precise control over the coupling between adjacent dots is important for quantum gate operations .    in this paper , we report charge detection measurements of a double few electron quantum dot containing a tunable number of electrons . by trapping a single electron in the double dot , a two - level system is formed . by analogy to molecular physics ,",
    "the double - dot can be viewed as an artificial @xmath0 molecule .",
    "@xcite following the work of petta _",
    "et al_.@xcite , we probe the temperature of this single trapped electron and extract the tunnel coupling energy by charge sensing measurements .",
    "we use a quantum point contact ( qpc ) as a charge sensor and address the effect of the back - action of the sensor on the molecule .",

    "the background signal was subtracted for clarity . ]",
    "figure  [ fig1](a ) shows a scanning electron micrograph of our coupled quantum dot device .",
    "the device consists of two lateral quantum dots connected in series to leads and coupled capacitively to a qpc .",
    "the dots as well as the qpc are defined within the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) of a gaas - algaas heterostructure , located 90 nm below the surface ( fig .",
    "[ fig1](b ) ) .",
    "the tunnel barriers indicated by double - arrows in the figure are tuned by negative voltages applied to gates 3 t , 1b , 3b and 5b .",
    "gates 2b and 4b may be regarded as `` plungers '' and are used to change the number of electrons .",
    "the dot - to - lead tunnel conductance is set to a very small value ( @xmath4 ) so that the coupled - dot system is well isolated from the leads , whereas the interdot tunnel conductance can be tuned from zero to @xmath5 .",
    "@xcite a negative voltage applied on gate r forms a qpc placed close to the right dot .",
    "this qpc , whose conductance is set around @xmath6 , is used as a charge sensor @xcite for the double - dot system .",
    "the device employs a gate layout geometry that permits transport down to the single electron regime .",
    "@xcite charge detection is performed by monitoring the derivative of the qpc current with respect to the voltage applied on gate 2b .",
    "this quantity , @xmath2 , the transconductance , is measured using standard lock - in techniques .",
    "the device was cooled in a oxford kelvinox @xmath7 dilution refrigerator with a base temperature of @xmath8 .",
    "the occupation numbers @xmath3 , defined as the number of electrons trapped in the left and right dot respectively , are determined by mapping the stability diagram of the double - dot .",
    "this can be achieved by measuring the transconductance as a function of the gate voltages @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "figure  [ fig1](c ) shows a grayscale plot of such a map . for clarity",
    ", we subtract the change in the background signal related to the direct capacitive coupling between the gates and the qpc .",
    "the dark lines depict a reduced transconductance corresponding to a change in the total electron number in the double - dot .",
    "together these lines form a honey - comb pattern , as expected for a double - dot .",
    "@xcite the more horizontal lines correspond to a change of one electron in the left dot .",
    "likewise the more vertical lines occur when the occupation of the right dot changes by one . away from these lines ,",

    "we now study the equilibrium property of the artificial @xmath0 molecule .",

    "the gate voltages applied to gates 1b and 5b are swept .",
    "three lines of different intensities , marked a , b and c in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) , are present in the greyscale plot . along resonances a and b , the left and right dot occupation changes from 0 to 1 electron respectively . because the sensor is more sensitive to changes in the right dot occupation number , the reduced transconductance is more pronounce for resonance b than a. along resonance c , the electron transfers between dots .",
    "whereas the transconductance dips lower than the background along the resonances a and b , the signal rises to a higher value for line c. this can be easily explained .",
    "as we sweep @xmath30 across resonance a or b in the upward direction , an electron is added to the double dot thereby reducing the qpc conductance .",
    "but for resonance c under the same conditions , the electron is transferred from the right to left dots ( i.e. away from the sensor ) , thereby increasing the qpc conductance .",
    "the absence of curvature in the position of peaks a and b implies that the tunnel coupling @xmath24 between the two dots is very small . under these conditions the spacing between the points labelled @xmath15 and @xmath16 in fig .",
    "[ fig2](b ) is equal to the coulomb interaction energy @xmath31 between dots @xcite which we estimate to be @xmath32 .",
    "since @xmath31 is large in comparison with thermal energy ( which we estimate to @xmath27 from our charge sensing measurements ) , the configuration in which only one electron is trapped in the double dot system is stable . in this regime ,",
    "the two charge states @xmath28 and @xmath12 form a two - level system characterized by two orbitals localized in dot 1 and dot 2 , with respective energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "along line c , the energy level of the left dot is aligned with that of the right dot ( @xmath35 ) . varying @xmath30 and @xmath36 along the diagonal perpendicular to line c ( labelled `` @xmath37''in fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) ) only changes the energy difference @xmath38 between the two charge states .",
    "the lever arm relating gate voltage to detuning can be calibrated experimentally as described below .",
    "the tunnel coupling @xmath24 is tuned in our device via @xmath39 .",
    "these two parameters fully characterize the two - level charge system whose hamiltonian can be written in terms of the pauli matrices as    @xmath40    a quantitative characterization of @xmath20 and @xmath24 is made by measuring the charge sensor signal along the detuning diagonal of the stability diagram at equilibrium .",
    "we employ the technique introduced by dicarlo _",
    "et al_. where the average occupation of the right dot , @xmath19 , can be extracted from the qpc current as a function of the detuning between dots .",
    "equivalently , for increased accuracy , we convert the transconductance into the derivative of @xmath19 with respect to @xmath20 .",
    "since the effects of the qpc on the two - level system were not addressed in previous works , we fit the data using a refined model , in which the back - action of the qpc on @xmath19 is taken into account . as we now explain , the model predicts small corrections when the coupling between the double - dot and the sensor is small and a significant change in the line shape of @xmath19 in the strong coupling regime .    the electrostatic interaction between the trapped electron and the qpc is fundamental to why we can distinguish the two charge states using the sensor signal .",
    "this coupling can be characterized by a dephasing rate @xmath41 , related to how well the two states can be distinguished .",
    "this rate is non zero only if a bias is applied across the qpc and is equal to @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the value of the current when the electron is localized in the left ( right ) dot .",
    "@xcite the discrete nature of the current through the qpc ( resulting in shot - noise ) induces fluctuations in the qubit potential causing dephasing .",
    "the occupation probability @xmath19 can be calculated from the equilibrium density matrix of the two - level system . for @xmath44 ,",
    "the density matrix is simply the one given by statistical mechanics where the electron trapped in the double - dot is assumed to be in thermal equilibrium with its electromagnetic environment at a temperature @xmath23 ( which relaxes the molecule to the ground state at a rate @xmath22 ) .",
    "such equilibration can occur through fluctuations in device control parameters such as gate voltage noise . using the method described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the finite temperature equilibrium density matrix in the presence of _ both _ sensor and reservoir can be calculated analytically .",

    "@xmath19 changes in a step - like manner from 0 to 1 as the detuning is swept across zero .",
    "the width of the transition is a combined measure of the tunnel coupling and the thermal energy . for non - zero @xmath41 but small compared to @xmath22 , the back - action slightly increases the width . in the regime of strong coupling ( @xmath54 ) , the back - action strongly distorts the average dot occupation .",

    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows the effect of increasing the dilution refrigerator temperature @xmath56 on the width of the resonance .",
    "although for these data the tunnel coupling is weak , its exact value can not be deduced from the charging diagram . by assuming that for temperatures above 150 mk , the electron is well thermalized to the refrigerator ( i.e. @xmath58 ) , we can calibrate the lever - arm relating the voltage along the detuning diagonal to energy and extract the precise value of @xmath24 .",

    "for comparison the electronic temperature of the 2deg in the leads was estimated to be approximately 30 mk from activation measurements of the quantum hall effect whilst the temperature extracted from coulomb blockade peaks was around 50 mk .",

    "notice that the signal to noise ratio is high at low temperatures . as a result ,",

    "@xcite the dependence of the tunnel coupling on the gate voltage @xmath71 is approximately exponential .",
    "this suggests that the gate primarily affects the height ( and/or the width ) of the tunnel barrier of the double - dot potential landscape .",
    "in conclusion , we have isolated a single electron in a lateral double quantum dot ( artificial @xmath0 molecule ) using a qpc as an integrated electrometer with a sensitivity smaller than the elementary charge @xmath72 .",
