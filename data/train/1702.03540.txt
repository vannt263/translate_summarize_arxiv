    "it quantifies event and particle averaged anisotropy in the azimuthal ( @xmath1 ) distribution of the particles relative to reaction plane angle ( @xmath5 ) @xcite .",
    "it is generally perceived that in non - central collisions , the anisotropic emission of final state particles results from the difference in the pressure gradient in a spatially anisotropic but locally thermalized system of quarks and gluons . below @xmath6 gev / c where majority of particles are produced ,",
    "this azimuthal anisotropy has been described as a hydrodynamical evolution of strongly interacting qgp with a nominal shear viscosity to the entropy density ratio @xcite ( @xmath7 extracted is close to ads / cft lower bound of 1/4@xmath8 ) .",
    "results from rhic and lhc have revealed that @xmath0 measured for different particles as a function of @xmath2 exhibits a characteristic mass ordering up to @xmath9 3 gev / c .",
    "that is , massive particles has less @xmath0 and vice - versa at fixed @xmath2 .",
    "whereas at intermediate @xmath2 , 3 @xmath10 6 gev / c , @xmath11 exhibits a flavor ordering i.e , baryon and meson @xmath0 bifurcates @xcite .",
    "the observed baryon - meson splitting of identified particles @xmath0 was found to be compatible with the models invoking hadronization of a collectively expanding partonic medium via a mechanism of quark recombination or coalescence @xcite .",
    "this was further supported by the observation of constituent quark number scaling ( ncq ) of hadron @xmath0 , providing a strong indication towards the onset of the partonic collectivity and the dominance of quark degrees of freedom at the time of hadronization @xcite .    at rhic energies , baryon - meson difference in @xmath0 and ncq - scaling",
    "was taken as a confirmation of quark coalescence being a plausible mechanism of hadronization at intermediate values of @xmath2 .",
    "but at lhc , scaling violation at a level of @xmath1210 - 20% and comparable magnitude of @xmath0 of @xmath1-mesons and protons in central collisions tend to disfavour coalescence as a relevant particle production mechanism at this range @xcite . in hybrid model calculations where partonic and hadronic evolution is modelled by hydrodynamics and hadronic cascade respectively @xcite , baryon and meson grouping of @xmath0 , i.e , @xmath13 at intermediate @xmath2 may be understood as a manifestation of increase in the mean transverse momentum @xmath14 and hence the @xmath2-integrated @xmath0 values of particles as a function of hadron mass .",
    "some of these hybrid models also predict upto 30% increase in the @xmath2-averaged @xmath0 due to expected rise in the radial boost at lhc when compared to au - au collisions at top - rhic energy @xcite .",
    "this increase in total transverse boost could be due to the build - up of additional radial flow in the hadronic phase that boosts massive hadrons to higher @xmath2 .",
    "as the effect is more pronounced for high mass particles , observed similarity in @xmath1-meson and proton @xmath0 appears to be consistent with the increased radial flow in central a - a collisions at lhc relative to rhic .",

    "thus , the baryon - meson grouping seems to be congruous with the mass of the particles rather than the number of quark content @xcite .",
    "generally , those particles which suffer less interactions in the hadronic phase are often termed as better probes of partonic phase of heavy ion collisions and may also be sensitive to the particle production mechanism .",
    "the hadronic interaction cross section of @xmath1-mesons with non - strange hadrons because of the ozi - suppression rule is rather small @xcite .",
    "consequently , @xmath1-mesons are not expected to undergo substantial rescattering in the late hadronic phase and decouple from the medium earlier that their non - strange counter parts @xcite .",
    "fact that the @xmath1-mesons are weakly coupled to the medium , radial boost developed during hadronic evolution has less - significant effect on @xmath1-mesons compared to other hadrons of similar masses .",
    "thus , the elliptic flow of @xmath1-mesons are expected to be more sensitive to the partonic stages of collision and shown to have negligibly affected by hadronic interactions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , recent measurements by the alice collaboration have shown a progressive shift in @xmath1-meson @xmath0 from meson to baryon band with increasing centrality and interpreted it as a consequence of pick - up of some additional radial flow in the post - hadronization phase @xcite . however , considering that @xmath1-mesons decouple prior to the build - up of radial flow in the hadronic phase , it seems unlikely to be an effect of radial flow only .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the models incorporating @xmath1-meson production in the hadronic rescattering stage via @xmath3 fusion predict a higher value of @xmath1-meson @xmath0 relative to other mesons .",
    "it would be therefore interesting to test the effect of hadronic interactions on the elliptic flow of @xmath1-mesons which in - turn may be useful in resolving the ambiguity over the origin baryon - meson grouping of @xmath0 at lhc .    here , using the string melting ( sm ) version of a multi phase transport model @xcite we have calculated @xmath0 of some selected species of hadrons including @xmath1-mesons for pb - pb collisions at 2.76 tev . to demonstrate the effect hadronic rescatterings on @xmath0 ,",
    "model simulation has been performed by varying the time of hadronic cascade .",
    "while discussing our results , emphasis has been given to @xmath0 of @xmath1-mesons as they are equally massive as protons and @xmath17s but of different quark content .",
    "we have also investigated whether the @xmath0 of @xmath1 mesons developed at the partonic phase is modified by additional contributions from the hadronic interactions like , @xmath18 @xmath1-meson production .",

    "ii , we briefly discuss about the ampt model and processes of @xmath1-meson production at the partonic and hadronic stage .",

    "<S> we have also observed a violation of hydrodynamical mass ordering between proton and @xmath1-meson @xmath0 further supporting that @xmath1-mesons are negligibly affected by the collective radial flow in the hadronic phase due to the small in - medium hadronic interaction cross sections . </S>"
