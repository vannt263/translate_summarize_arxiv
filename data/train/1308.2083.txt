    "the ability to determine an unknown quantum state produced by some source is central for many applications in quantum information science .",
    "the procedure of reconstructing the quantum state , known as quantum state tomography , has therefore been under intense investigations and continues to attract a lot of attention @xcite . in the continuous variable regime , and in particular its quantum optical realizations , there are two commonly used approaches to quantum tomography . in optical homodyne tomography , the set of rotated quadratures is measured using balanced homodyne detection , thus allowing one to  scan  the phase space of the system @xcite .",
    "the alternative method uses the husimi @xmath0-function which can be measured using a double homodyne detection scheme , and has the advantage that the reconstruction requires the measurement of only a single observable @xcite .    both of the above instances fall under the class of gaussian measurements , i.e. , measurements which yield a gaussian measurement outcome distribution whenever the system is initially in a gaussian state @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to present a method for investigating whether or not a given set of such gaussian observables is informationally complete @xcite , i.e. , allows the reconstruction of an unknown quantum state of the system from the statistics .",
    "we consider an @xmath1-mode electromagnetic field , whose phase space is therefore @xmath2-dimensional . we show that by measuring a gaussian observable one obtains the values of the weyl transform of the state on a linear subspace of the phase space .",
    "therefore , for a set of observables the union of these subspaces needs to be `` sufficiently large '' in order for unique state determination to be possible .",
    "in particular , we show that if one does not have access to a single informationally complete gaussian observable , then one necessarily needs infinitely many observables .    after these general results we focus on two specific instances .",
    "firstly , we investigate single informationally complete gaussian observables in more detail .",
    "we show that if we restrict to the smallest possible dimension of the outcome space , then the set of informationally complete gaussian observables is exhausted , up to linear transformations of the measurement outcomes , by gaussian observables which are covariant with respect to phase space translations .",
    "furthermore , we show that in a suitable symplectic coordinatization of the phase space , any informationally complete gaussian observable with a minimal outcome space is a postprocessing of the @xmath0-function .",
    "secondly , we study commutative gaussian observables which then include projection valued ( also called sharp ) gaussian observables as special cases .",
    "we show that no finite set of such observables is informationally complete . for an arbitrary set of generalized field quadratures , i.e. , sharp gaussian observables with one - dimensional outcome space , we prove a further characterization for informational completeness .",
    "we also find an interesting connection between the generalized quadratures and informationally complete gaussian phase space observables .",
    "finally , we consider a more general scenario where the measurement coupling is represented by a general linear bosonic channel .",
    "also in the general case we obtain a characterization for informational completeness and deal explicitly with general covariant phase space observables .",
    "the hilbert space of an electromagnetic field consisting of @xmath1 bosonic modes is the @xmath1-fold tensor product @xmath3 , where each single mode hilbert space is spanned by the number states @xmath4 .",
    "the creation and annihilation operators related to the @xmath5 mode are denoted by @xmath6 and @xmath7 . in the coordinate representation @xmath8 where the number states are represented by the hermite functions .",
    "the hilbert space of the entire field is then @xmath9 .",
    "the states of the field are represented by positive trace one operators acting on @xmath10 , and the observables are represented by positive operator valued measures ( povms ) defined on a @xmath11-algebra of subsets of some measurement outcome set . in this paper , we will only consider observables taking values in @xmath12 .",
    "each observable is thus represented by a map @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the borel @xmath11-algebra of @xmath12 and @xmath15 denotes the set of bounded operators on @xmath10 , and which satisfies positivity @xmath16 , normalization @xmath17 and @xmath11-additivity @xmath18 for any sequence of pairwise disjoint sets where the series converges in the weak operator topology . when a measurement of @xmath19 is performed on the system initially prepared in a state @xmath20 , the measurement outcomes are distributed according to the probability measure @xmath21}$ ] .",
    "the phase space of the @xmath1-mode em - field is @xmath22 and we use the notation @xmath23 for the canonical coordinates .",
    "the phase space translations are represented in @xmath10 by the weyl operators @xmath24 where the matrix @xmath25 determines the symplectic form @xmath26 and @xmath27 , with @xmath28 and @xmath29 being the canonical quadrature ( i.e. , position and momentum ) operators acting on the @xmath5 mode .",
    "whenever appropriate , we will emphasize the number of modes in question with a subscript so that , e.g. , in the above case we would have @xmath30 .",
    "due to the stone - von neumann theorem , the weyl operators are determined by the relation @xmath31 up to unitary equivalence .",
    "this unitary freedom corresponds to the choice of the canonical coordinates : let @xmath32 denote the group of symplectic transformations of @xmath22 , i.e. , real invertible @xmath33-matrices @xmath34 satisfying @xmath35 .",
    "if we change the coordinates as @xmath36 , then the original weyl operators in the new coordinates are given by @xmath37 .",
    "since @xmath38 is symplectic , the operators @xmath39 indeed also satisfy the weyl relation , and there exists a unitary operator @xmath40 such that @xmath41 for all @xmath42 . summarizing , a change of canonical coordinates is effected by the transformation @xmath43 where @xmath44 .",

    "the weyl transform is a continuous function , so that @xmath20 is already determined if we know the values of @xmath49 on a dense subset of @xmath22 .",

    "thus , @xmath66 is of the required type .",

    "this can be conveniently expressed in terms of the characteristic function of the povm @xmath84 in which case @xmath19 is gaussian whenever @xmath85 where @xmath86 is a @xmath87-matrix and @xmath88 is a @xmath89-matrix which satisfy the positive definiteness condition @xmath90 and @xmath91 . note that our definition differs from the one used , e.g. , in @xcite where the outcome space of a gaussian observable is assumed to be a symplectic space , i.e. , even dimensional . the physical motivation for this definition will become apparent in the next section where measurement schemes realizing gaussian observables are discussed .",
    "a postprocessing of a measurement is a fixed transformation performed on the measurement outcome distribution .",
    "this is relevant for informational completeness , because information can only get lost in such a process ; if a postprocessing is informationally complete , then so is the original measurement .",

    "accordingly , we concentrate mostly on sharp observables in the concrete examples .",
    "consider now the special case of a one dimensional outcome space . then for any gaussian observable @xmath19",
    ", the matrix @xmath86 is , in fact , a vector in @xmath22 , and we let @xmath268 .",
    "the condition is automatically satisfied , so we conclude that every gaussian observable @xmath269 is commutative , and thus a gaussian smearing of the corresponding sharp observable @xmath252 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath269 is a gaussian observable with matrix @xmath86 , then @xmath19 is a gaussian smearing of @xmath270 with @xmath271 , exactly when @xmath272 .",
    "the observable @xmath252 has the characteristic function @xmath273 so that @xmath252 is simply the spectral measure of the selfadjoint operator @xmath274 these operators are sometimes referred to as a generalized field quadratures , and they have also previously been considered in the context of quantum tomography @xcite .",
    "[ prop : ic_set_of_gaussian_povms ] now reduces to the following result :    [ prop : one_dim_case ] let @xmath275 , @xmath266 be gaussian observables with corresponding vectors @xmath276",
    ". then @xmath277 is informationally complete if and only if @xmath278 is dense in the surface of the unit ball of @xmath22 .",
    "we now look at two particular examples in the case of a single mode ( @xmath259 ) .    by setting @xmath279 and @xmath280",
    "we obtain the well known rotated quadrature operators @xmath281 , the corresponding observables being denoted by @xmath282 . from prop .",
    "[ prop : one_dim_case ] we immediately see that we can restrict our attention to the values @xmath283 , and that a set of the form @xmath284 where @xmath285 is informationally complete if and only if @xmath179 is dense in @xmath286 .",
    "this therefore sharpens the result of , e.g. , @xcite by proving that density is indeed also necessary .",
    "explicitly , the line on which the weyl transform can be determined from the measurement of a quadrature @xmath282 , is given by @xmath287    as a slight modification , we set @xmath288 and @xmath289 so that we obtain the squeezed rotated quadratures @xmath290 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath291 so that for @xmath292 any change in the value of the squeezing parameter @xmath293 causes a change in the slope of the line .",
    "for instance , we can fix only two values @xmath294 and consider a set @xmath295 of squeezing parameters . by prop .",
    "[ prop : one_dim_case ] , the set @xmath296 is informationally complete if and only if @xmath297 is dense in the unit circle , which happens exactly when @xmath179 is dense in @xmath298 . indeed , for each of the four choices of signs , the map @xmath299 bijectively parametrizes the part of the unit circle lying in the interior of the @xmath300-quadrant .",
    "in a similar manner we can consider any finite number of values for @xmath301 .",
    "the benefit of adding more rotations is that for a fixed @xmath301 one only has to find a set of squeezing parameters which is dense in some interval @xmath302 $ ] in order to guarantee informational completeness .",
    "we could also have looked at smearings of sharp quadratures . as already mentioned",
    ", this does not add any more structure from the point of view of informational completeness .",
    "however , smearings often appear more naturally than sharp observables ; we close this section with a particular case involving postprocessing .",
    "consider the linear postprosessing @xmath98 of a phase space observable @xmath19 with matrix @xmath86 , given by a @xmath303 matrix @xmath94 .",
    "such a postprocessing is called a ( nonnormalized ) marginal of @xmath19 .",
    "now @xmath98 has one - dimensional outcome space , and is a commutative gaussian smearing of the generalized quadrature given by the vector @xmath304 . using this equality , together with cor .",
    "[ cor : ic_gaussian_povm ] , we now get the following characterization of informational completeness of phase space observables in terms of quadratures .    [ prop : info_complete_connection ] let @xmath19 be a gaussian phase space observable .",
    "then the following are equivalent :    * @xmath19 is informationally complete ; * there is a one - to - one correspondence between generalized quadratures @xmath270 , @xmath271 , and linear maps @xmath305 , such that @xmath99 is a gaussian smearing of @xmath270 .",
    "as we have noted before , the physical motivation for the definition of gaussian observables comes from their measurement realizations : any gaussian povm can be measured by first applying a gaussian channel to the system , and then performing homodyne detection .",
    "now gaussian channels are special cases of what are known as linear bosonic channels , that is , channels @xmath306 which map weyl operators according to @xmath307 where @xmath76 is a @xmath77 matrix and @xmath65 is a complex valued function which must again satisfy suitable complete positivity conditions @xcite . the corresponding generalization for gaussian observables",
    "is then given by povms @xmath13 satisfying @xmath308 again with some restrictions on @xmath86 and @xmath309 .",
    "we immediately notice that the only difference in the treatment of informational completeness when compared to the gaussian case is that the function @xmath65 may be zero at some points .",
    "hence , by measuring @xmath19 we can always determine the values of @xmath49 on the set @xmath310 where @xmath186 is the subspace related to any gaussian observable with the parameter @xmath86 . in particular , we have @xmath311 but this is typically not a subspace .",
    "the proof of the following characterization of informational completeness is identical to the proof of thm .",
    "[ prop : ic_set_of_gaussian_povms ] and is therefore omitted .",
    "let @xmath312 , @xmath313 , be observables satisfying for some set of parameters @xmath314",
    ". then @xmath315 is informationally complete if and only if @xmath316 is dense in @xmath22 .",
    "note that in this more general scenario , a finite set of observables may be informationally complete even though no single observable is such .",
    "for instance , suppose that @xmath19 and @xmath317 are two observables for which @xmath318 but @xmath319 .",
    "then it may happen that @xmath320 and @xmath321 for some open sets @xmath173 and @xmath322 for which @xmath323 . in that case",
    "neither observable is informationally complete but the pair @xmath324 is since @xmath325 .    as an example , consider covariant phase space observables , i.e. , povms @xmath200 satisfying @xmath201 any covariant phase space observable is generated by a unique positive trace one operator @xmath11 , giving the observable the explicit form @xcite @xmath326 in particular , if @xmath11 is a gaussian state , then @xmath327 is a covariant gaussian observable .",
    "the characteristic function of @xmath327 can be calculated using eq .   and the fact that @xmath328}\\ , { { \\rm d}}{\\bf x } = { \\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { t } \\right]}{\\mathrm{tr}\\left [ { s } \\right]}\\ ] ] for any @xmath329 ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * lemma 1 ) ) . as a result",
    "we obtain @xmath330 so that compared to eq .",
    "we have @xmath331 , in accordance with eq .  , and @xmath332 .",
    "using the fact that @xmath333 if and only if @xmath334 , we find that @xmath335 in particular , the covariant phase space observable @xmath327 is informationally complete if and only if @xmath336 , that is , the weyl transform of the generating operator @xmath11 has full support .",
    "this result was obtained also in @xcite .",
    "notice that any covariant phase space observable can be measured with the setup depicted in sec .  [",
    "sec : covariant ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : eightport ] by choosing the state of the parameter field appropriately ( for technical details , see @xcite ) .",
    "this example actually demonstrates how these more general observables corresponding to linear bosonic channels arise .",
    "indeed , if we take the dilation of a gaussian channel as presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : dilation ] and replace the state of the auxiliary field by an arbitrary one , then we obtain a linear bosonic channel , and thus an observable , which is typically not gaussian but still of the form .",
    "another occasion where these observables may arise is any gaussian measurement which is subject to classical noise . indeed , if @xmath337 is a gaussian observable parametrized by @xmath92 and @xmath338 $ ] is a probability measure , then @xmath339 which corresponds to eq .   with @xmath340 .",
    "hence , @xmath341 in particular , if @xmath342 is an informationally complete phase space observable , then @xmath104 is informationally complete if and only if @xmath343 .",
    "we have proved a characterization for the informational completeness of an arbitrary set of gaussian observables . as a consequence , we have shown that unless one has access to a single informationally complete gaussian observable , then one needs infinitely many observables .",
    "we have characterized informationally complete gaussian observables which are minimal in the sense of having the smallest possible dimension of the outcome space , as the observables which are bijective linear postprocessing of covariant gaussian phase space observables .",
    "we have then developed this further and shown that any minimal informationally complete gaussian observable is actually a postprocessing of the observable @xmath227 for which the outcome distribution is the @xmath0-function of the state , given a suitable symplectic coordinatization of the phase space .",
    "we have also treated commutative gaussian observables separately , and shown that infinitely many such observables are needed in order to reach informational completeness . as a special case",
    "we have characterized informationally complete sets of generalized field quadratures , i.e. , sharp gaussian observables with one - dimensional outcome space , and proved a connection between informationally complete gaussian phase space observables and generalized field quadratures .",
    "since gaussian observables can be measured by combining gaussian channels with homodyne detection , we have also studied the natural generalization to the case where the gaussian channel is replaced by a linear bosonic channel .",
