    "@xmath5 does not depend on specific states to be measured , the right - hand side ( rhs ) of the inequality provides a fixed lower bound and a more general framework of quantifying uncertainty than the standard deviations @xcite .",
    "moreover , once using quantum memory to store information about the measured system , the entropic uncertainty bound could even be violated @xcite .",
    "all these entropic uncertainty relations play an important role in many quantum information processing .",
    "however , constructed from the probability distribution of a measurement taken , entropic function is still a rather coarse way of measuring the uncertainty of a set of measurements ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "for instance , one can not distinguish the uncertainty inherent in obtaining any combination of outcomes for different measurements . to overcome",
    "this defect , a new form of uncertainty relation , i.e. , fine - grained uncertainty relation ( fgur ) , has been proposed recently @xcite . for a set of measurements labeled by @xmath6 , associating with every combination of possible outcomes @xmath7",
    ", there exist a set of inequalities @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the probability of choosing a particular measurement , @xmath10 is the probability that one obtains the outcome @xmath11 after performing measurement @xmath6 on the state @xmath12 . to measure the uncertainty ,",
    "the maximum in function @xmath13 should be taken over all states allowed on a particular system .",
    "it can be proved that one can not obtain outcomes with certainty for all measurements simultaneously when @xmath14 . on the other hand , for the so - called maximally certain state ( mcs )",
    ", the inequality ( [ fgur ] ) can be saturated . since its introduction , many applications have been found for the fgur .",
    "for instance , it was shown @xcite that the fgur could be used to discriminate among classical , quantum , and superquantum correlations involving two or three parties . moreover ,",
    "the uncertainty bound in ( [ fgur ] ) could be optimized once the measured system is assisted by a quantum memory @xcite .",
    "dramatically , a profound link between the fgur and the second law of thermodynamics has been found @xcite , which claims that a violation of uncertainty relation implies a violation of thermodynamical law .",
    "other studies from various perspectives could be found in @xcite .",
    "while most of studies on uncertainty relations are nonrelativistic , a complete account of these relations requires one to understand them in relativistic regime , which may even shed new light on quantum gravity @xcite . in the previous work @xcite",
    ", we have shown that , besides the choice on the observers , the entropic uncertainty bound should also depend on the relativistic motion state of the observer who performs the measurement .",
    "this new character of quantum - memory - assisted entropic uncertainty relation ( eur ) is a direct result of entanglement generation in a relativistic system .    in this paper",
    ", we explore the fgur under the decoherence rooting in the relativistic motion of quantum systems , and find the uncertainty bound does depend on the motion state of the system .",
    "we first consider observer undergoes an _ uniform _ acceleration relative to an inertial reference .",
    "since two frames differ in their description of a given quantum state due to the unruh effect , the concept of measurement becomes observer - dependent , which implies a nontrivial relativistic modification to the fgur . without loss of generality , beyond the single - mode approximation",
    ", we show that the unruh effect modifies the uncertainty bound for the measurements in @xmath15 mutually unbiased bases ( mubs ) , which are intimately related to complementarity principle .",
    "dramatically , we find that , for a noninertial observer , the measurements in general mubs could be distinguished from each other , while they share same uncertainty bound in inertial frame .",
    "we extend these results to an alternative scenario , where , to prevent the unruh decoherence , an observer is restricted in a single rigid cavity which undergoes an _ nonuniform _ acceleration .",
    "we show that the uncertainty could be degraded by the nonuniform acceleration of cavity during particular epoch , while the uncertainty bound itself exhibits a periodic evolution with respect to the duration of the acceleration .",
    "this phenomenon can be attributed to the entanglement generation between the field modes in single cavity that plays the role of quantum memory . moreover , except the acceleration - duration time with integer periods , the measurements in different mubs are distinguishable by the corresponding uncertainty bounds .",
    "we first investigate the fgur for an observer with uniform acceleration @xmath16 , who performs projective measurements on the quantum state constructed from free field modes . for the noninertial observer traveling in , e.g. , right rindler wedge , field modes in left rindler wedge are unaccessible . the information loss associated with the acceleration horizon results in a thermal bath . from quantum information point of view @xcite ,",
    "this celebrated unruh effect induces a nontrivial evolution of quantum entanglement between field modes which plays a prominent role in most quantum - information protocols .    for simplicity ,",
    "considering fermionic field with few degrees , the most general vacuum state @xmath17 should be annihilated by unruh operators @xmath18 @xcite c_k , u&=&q_rc_k , r^+q_lc_k , l , q_r^2+q_l^2=1 , + c_k , r&=&_k ,-",

    "the particle and antiparticle operators @xmath22 and @xmath23 in respective rindler wedge @xmath24 satisfy the usual anti commutation relations . by analytic construction to whole spacetime , the proper unruh modes are symmetric between rindler wedges i and ii .",
    "for particular frequency @xmath25 , the unruh vacuum is @xcite    & & + ( |1100-|0011 ) [ unruh - f-0 ] and the first excitation is    & & + q_l(|1101+|0001 ) [ unruh - f - one ] where we introduce the notations    anti - particle vacua are denoted by @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "it should be noted that different operator ordering in fermonic systems could lead to nonunique results in quantum information @xcite .",
    "for instance , if we rearrange operator ordering in ( [ notation ] ) as @xmath28 , then a new fock basis is defined @xmath29 .",
    "this so - called physical ordering @xcite , in which all region i operators appear to the left of all region ii operators , was proposed to guarantee the entanglement behavior of above states would yield physical results .",
    "hereafter , we adopt this particular operator ordering .    to explore how the relativistic motion of an observer could influence the fgur",
    ", we consider a scenario in which the state to be measured should be prepared in an inertial frame .",
    "after that , the observer undergoes an uniform acceleration and performs measurements . since the state should be described in the corresponding rindler frame , information would lose via unruh effect .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty obtained by the accelerated observer would be motion - dependent .",
    "we illustrate above insight by measurements @xmath30 and @xmath31 , behaving as the best measurement basis , where pauli operators @xmath30 and @xmath31 with equal probability @xmath32 are chosen @xcite .",
    "remarkably , along with @xmath33 , three set of their eigenvectors form the mubs in hilbert space with dimension @xmath15 , which plays central role to theoretical investigations and practical exploitations of complementarity properties @xcite .    for all pure states @xmath34 , @xmath35,\\phi\\in[0,2\\pi)$ ] , the corresponding density matrix @xmath36 should be rewritten according to the transformation ( [ unruh - f-0 ] ) and ( [ unruh - f - one ] ) . since the field modes in rindler wedge ii is unaccessible to observer , after tracing over the modes in wedge ii ,",
    "the reduced density matrix is _ red&&_|| + & = & |00_00|(^2c^4+^2q_l^2c^2 ) + & & + |11_11|(^2s^4+^2q_r^2s^2 ) + & & + |01_01|(^2s^2c^2 ) + & & + |10_10|(^2s^2c^2+^2q_r^2c^2+^2q_l^2s^2 ) + & & -|00_01|e^iq_lsc^2 + & & + |00_10|e^-iq_rc^3 + & & -|00_11|^2q_rq_lsc + & & + |01_11|e^-iq_rs^2c + & & + |10_11|e^iq_ls^3+(h.c . ) _ with abbreviation @xmath37 . after performing the projective measurements @xmath30 and @xmath31 on particle sector , we have the probabilities for the outcomes @xmath38 p(0^z|_z)_&&(|0^+_0|_red)=c^2(^2+^2q_l^2 ) , + p(0^x|_x)_&&(|+^+_+|_red ) + & = & + q_rc . here ,",
    "for later convenience , we chose the measurements in basis @xmath39 and @xmath40 which are the eigenstates of pauli matrix @xmath30 and @xmath31 restricted in rindler wedge i. therefore , lhs of fgur ( [ fgur ] ) should be u&&[p(0^z|_z)_+p(0^x|_x ) _ ] + & = & [ q_rc+(q_r^2+q_l^2 + 1)c^2 + 1 ] for a particular unruh mode with fixed acceleration , one can estimate that the maximum of @xmath41 which is @xmath42 should always be obtained with @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "this means that the mcs which saturates the inequality ( [ fgur ] ) is independent of the acceleration of the observer , which indicates that once we choose the bases enabling an optimal uncertainty on average in an inertial frame , the corresponding measurements should maintain their optimality for all noninertial observer",
    ". this remarkable phenomenon could be useful in many real quantum process , for instance , the bb84 states @xmath45 and @xmath46 in quantum cryptography @xcite .    explicitly , the dependence of the fine - grained uncertainty bound with outcomes @xmath38 on the acceleration parameter and choice of unruh modes could be expressed as _ ( 0^x,0^z)&=&[c^2(1+q_l^2 + q_r^2)+q_rc+1 ] [ bound1 ]    above calculation can extend to any other pairs of outcomes @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , which all give the same bound @xmath50 in inertial frame @xcite .",
    "dramatically , we find that the nontrivial unruh effect could distinguish these four pairs of measurements and separate them into two categories .",
    "for instance , we have p(1^z|_z)_&&(|1_1|_red ) + & = & ^2s^2+^2(q_r^2+q_l^2s^2 ) , + p(1^x|_x)_&&(|-_-|_red ) + & = & -q_rc . which give _ ( 1^x,1^z)&=&[(1+c^2)q_r^2+(1+q_l^2)s^2+q_rc+1 ] + [ bound2 ] for the mcs with @xmath51 and @xmath44 .",
    "after straightforward calculations , it can be shown that the uncertainty bound @xmath52 is also dependent on the direction of @xmath53axis , that measurements @xmath47 share the same bound ( [ bound2 ] ) with @xmath49 , while @xmath48 has the same bound ( [ bound1 ] ) with @xmath38 .",
    "this is definitely a new feature of fine - grained uncertainty bound triggered by noninertial relativistic motion .    to further explore the influence of unruh effect on fugr",
    ", we illustrate the uncertainty bounds ( [ bound1 ] ) and ( [ bound2 ] ) for three different choice of unruh modes , as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fgur1 ] .",
    "is dependent on the acceleration parameter @xmath54 and choice of unruh modes .",
    "three set of curves correspond to the choice of unruh modes with @xmath55 ( black solid ) , @xmath56 ( red dashed ) and @xmath57 ( blue dashed - double - dotted ) . ]    for the case with @xmath55 , where the minkowskian annihilation operator is taken to be one of the right or left moving unruh modes , the noninertial observer would detect a single - mode state once the field is in a special superposition of minkowski monochromatic modes from an inertial perspective @xcite . under this single - mode approximation ( sma ) ,",
    "commonly assumed in the old literature on relativistic quantum information @xcite , we recover the standard result @xmath50 for vanishing acceleration .",
    "as @xmath54 growing , the value of @xmath52 decreases , indicating an increment on measurement uncertainty .    while there is no essential difference in the behavior of measurement uncertainty for outcomes @xmath38 and @xmath48 with various @xmath20 , however , the uncertainty bounds ( [ bound2 ] ) are sensitive with the choice of unruh modes . surprisingly ,",
    "as @xmath54 growing , for the unruh modes with large @xmath20 , we observe a decrement on measurement uncertainty for outcomes @xmath47 and @xmath49 , which means that unruh effect could even lift the uncertainty bound in ( [ fgur ] ) .    finally , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fgur1 ] , we find that the distinguishability between the measurements in mubs is a common feature for any choice of unruh modes . to explain this , recall that , by definition , a set of orthonormal bases @xmath58 for a hilbert space @xmath59 where @xmath60 is called unbiased iff @xmath61 , @xmath62 holds for all basis vectors @xmath63 and @xmath64 belong to different bases , i.e. , @xmath65 . from an inertial perspective , the mubs are intimately related to complementarity principle @xcite , which indicates that the measurement of a observable reveals no information about the outcome of another one if their corresponding bases are mutually unbiased .",
    "however , for a noninertial observer , the bases @xmath58 should be transformed according to proper bogoliubov transformations , which in general breaks the orthonormality . in other word , the mubs in inertial frame would become non - mubs from a noninertial perspective . therefore , for the observer undergoing an uniform acceleration , we conclude that unruh effect could distinguish measurements in mubs .",
    "we now discuss an alternative scenario in which observer is localized in a rigid cavity .",
    "while the rigid boundaries of the cavity protect the inside observer from the unruh effect , the relativistic motion of the cavity would still affect the entanglement between the free field modes inside @xcite , therefore leading to a motion - dependent uncertainty bound @xcite .    for simplicity",
    ", we consider a @xmath66-dimensional model , where the cavity with length @xmath67 imposes the dirichlet conditions on the eigenfunctions @xmath68 of the hamiltonian .",
    "a typical trajectory of nonuniform - moving cavity contains three segments referred as ( i ) when the cavity maintains its inertial status , then ( ii ) begins to accelerate at @xmath69 , following the killing vector @xmath70 , and finally ( iii ) the acceleration ends at rindler time @xmath71 , and the duration of the acceleration in proper time measured at the center of the cavity is @xmath72 .",
    "the dirac field can be expanded in quantized eigenfunctions as @xmath73 in segment i , and similarly be expressed by @xmath74 in segment ii and @xmath75 in segment iii. the nonvanishing anticommutators @xmath76 define the vacuum @xmath77 .",
    "any two field modes in distinct regions can be related by bogoliubov transformations like @xmath78 and @xmath79 , where the coefficients can be calculated perturbatively in the limit of small cavity acceleration @xcite .",
    "more specifically , by introducing the dimensionless parameter @xmath80 , which is the product of the cavity s length and the acceleration at the center of the cavity , the coefficients can be expanded in a maclaurin series to @xmath81 order , @xmath82 , and similarly @xmath83 .",
    "we start from a pure state @xmath84 in segment i. after the uniform acceleration , we can express this state in segment iii by means of the bogoliubov transformations , which contains modes within all frequency . throughout the process",
    ", we assume that the observer can only be sensitive to modes in particular frequency @xmath85 .",
    "therefore all other modes with frequency @xmath86 should be traced out in the density matrix @xmath87 , which leads to _",
    "red&=&_k|_k_k| + & = & |_k_k|(-f^-_k+f^+_k ) + & & + |_k^++_k|(+f^-_k - f^+_k ) + & & + |_k^+_k|e^-i(g_k+^(2)_kk ) + & & + |_k^+_k|e^i(g_k+^(2)_kk)^ * where the coefficients are @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
