    "complex systems where elementary units have different types of interactions can be conveniently modelled as multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "this is a very generic representation , where elements of a system are organized in multiple network layers , each standing for a specific color or flavour of interaction .",
    "systems that can be represented in this way are abundant in the real world .",
    "examples include , among others , social networks sharing the same actors  @xcite , and multimodal transportation graphs sharing common geographical locations  @xcite .",
    "several analyses of multiplex networks have been performed recently  @xcite .",
    "a common result , shared by the vast majority of these studies , is that a processes defined on a multiplex network is characterized by features radically different from those observed for the same type of process when this is applied to an isolated network .",
    "examples regard dynamical processes taking place on multiplex networks , such as diffusion  @xcite , epidemic spreading  @xcite , synchronization  @xcite , and controllability  @xcite .",
    "examples include also structural processes as those typically framed in terms of percolation models .",
    "for instance in their seminal paper , buldyrev _ et al .",
    "_ considered a site - percolation model aimed at understanding the role of interdependencies among two network layers  @xcite .",
    "the macroscopic cluster of mutually connected nodes in a multiplex network emerges discontinuously , at odds with what instead observed for the same process on an isolated network where the percolation transition is always continuous .",
    "a large number of subsequent studies have then analyzed in detail the features of the percolation transition in multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "several variants of the percolation model have been also considered , including redundant site percolation  @xcite , k - core percolation  @xcite , weak percolation  @xcite , and bond percolation  @xcite .    in this paper , we focus our attention on an additional variant of the percolation model usually named as the observability model  @xcite . in isolated networks ,",
    "the model finds its motivation in the study of some dynamical processes where the state of the system can be determined by monitoring or dominating the states of a limited number of nodes in the network  @xcite .",
    "examples include , among others , real - time monitoring of power - grid networks  @xcite and mobile ad - hoc networks  @xcite .",
    "the observability model has been considered in synthetic models  @xcite and real - world topologies  @xcite . in the simplest version of the model ,",
    "every node in the network can host an observer with probability @xmath0 .",
    "placing an observer on one node can make the node itself and all its nearest neighbors observable .",
    "nodes in the network can therefore assume three different states : ( i ) directly observable , if hosting an observer ; ( ii ) indirectly observable , if being the first neighbor of an observer ; ( iii ) or not observable , otherwise .",
    "observable , either directly or indirectly , nearest - neighbor nodes form clusters of connected observable nodes . as in the case of percolation , the question of interest in network observability is understanding the macroscopic formation of observable clusters in the network on the basis of microscopic changes in the state of its individual nodes . in synthetic infinite graphs ,",
    "the macroscopic cluster of observable nodes obeys a continuous phase transition as a function of the probability @xmath0 , and the critical threshold is generally very small  @xcite . in most real - world networks also , the largest cluster grows smoothly , and the transition point is generally very close to zero  @xcite .    in our extension of the observability model to multiplex networks , we focus our attention on the emergence of clusters of mutually observable nodes . the definition of these clusters is a straightforward combination of the notions of clusters of observable nodes in isolated networks  @xcite and clusters of mutually connected nodes in multiplex networks  @xcite .",
    "the extension of the observability model to multiplex networks finds its rationale in any situation where the goal is monitoring or controlling the dynamics of a system structured in multiple layers of interactions .",
    "a genuine example could be tracking the spread of information on two coupled social media , such as facebook and twitter .",
    "actors are shared by the two social networks .",
    "observing an individual means getting full access to her / his accounts thus being able to read the content of the messages that the individual , and her / his friends , are posting on the two platforms . clusters of mutually observable nodes in this sense correspond to connected portions of the systems where the content of information that is exchanged by people within the cluster can be completely monitored .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : intro ] , we define the observability model in multiplex networks . in section  [ sec : random ] , we study the model in ensembles of multiplex networks whose layers are generated according to the configuration model . in section  [ sec : real ] , we introduce a message - passing method to deal with the observability model in multiplex networks with specified topology , such as real - world multiplex networks . the framework described in this section",
    "is based on the assumption that the number of edges shared by the different layers of the multiplex is negligible .",
    "the message - passing method valid for multiplex networks in presence of edge overlap is much more cumbersome , and , for this reason , presented only in the supplemental material . finally , in section",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] , we summarize the main findings of the paper .",
    "we consider a multiplex network composed of @xmath1 nodes structured in two layers , namely @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "node labels take integer values from @xmath4 to @xmath1 in both layers .",
    "nodes with identical labels correspond to copies ( or replicas ) of the same individual or unit in the two layers .",
    "the observability model we consider here is a natural extension to multiplex networks of the same model already considered on isolated networks  @xcite .",
    "observers or sensors are placed at random with probability @xmath0 on every node in the system .",
    "if an observer is placed on a node @xmath5 , the node @xmath5 is directly observable in both layers .",
    "a node @xmath5 , that is not directly observable , but is attached to at least one directly observable node @xmath6 in layer @xmath2 and at least one directly observable node @xmath7 in layer @xmath3 , with @xmath6 not necessarily equal to @xmath7 , is indirectly observable .",
    "we focus our attention on mutually observable clusters of nodes .",
    "the way these clusters are defined is identical to the one in which clusters of mutually connected nodes are defined in site percolation  @xcite .",
    "the only difference comes from the fact that a node in order to be `` occupied '' can be either in the directly or indirectly observable state .",
    "note that mutually connected and mutually observable clusters coincide for @xmath8 . in particular ,",
    "a cluster of mutually observable nodes is defined in a recursive manner and is composed by all the nodes that are connected by at least by one path ( internal to the cluster itself ) in both layers .",
    "our model can be seen as a depth - one percolation model on a multiplex network .",
    "as we are interested in understanding the extent of the system that can be monitored by placing random points of observation , the focus of our analysis is centered on quantifying how the size of the largest mutually observable cluster ( lmoc ) changes as a function of the microscopic probability @xmath0 of nodes to be directly observable . to generate the mathematical framework necessary to study such a model ,",
    "we make use of a simple self - consistent condition : an observable node belongs to the lmoc if it has , in both layers , at least one neighbor that is part of the lmoc . such a condition can be expressed in terms of elementary conditional probabilities defined for the edges and the nodes of the multiplex network . in the following",
    ", we discuss the details of how the mathematical framework can be solved exactly under two conditions : ( i ) absence of link overlap among layers , and ( ii ) validity of the locally treelike ansatz . in the supplemental material ,",
    "we report the full mathematical framework valid when condition ( i ) is removed .",
    "let us consider the case of a multiplex composed of two network layers generated independently according to the configuration model  @xcite . if the layers are sufficiently sparse , the fact that the layers are generated independently allow us to consider the overlap among layers ( i.e. , the simultaneous existence of the same edge in both layers happens with vanishing probability ) negligible . the only inputs required to study such a system are the degree distributions of the two layers , namely @xmath9}(k)$ ] and @xmath10}(k)$ ] .",

    "in this paper , we extended the observability model , originally considered on isolated networks , to multiplex networks . in particular , we focused our attention on the emergence of the largest cluster of mutually observed nodes as a function of the microscopic probability of individual nodes to host observers .",
    "we developed mathematical frameworks able to well describe the observability diagram in synthetic and real - world multiplex networks .",
    "our results indicate that the features of this phase transition can not be trivially deduced from those valid for the percolation transition .",
    "this statement is true both for randomly generated multiplex networks , as well as for multiplex networks representing real - world systems .",
    "interestingly , real - world multiplex networks seem to be always in the observable regime , as long as the fraction of nodes that is directly observed is larger than zero .",
    "this fact seems due to the natural , and ubiquitously observed , presence of edge overlap among the layers that compose real multiplex networks .",
