    "a convenient measure of the electron gas density @xmath3 is the dimensionless parameter @xmath4 @xmath5 defined as the radius @xmath6 of the unit disk divided by the bohr radius @xmath7 .",
    "the unit disk encloses an area equal to the area per electron of the gas . for a real two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) created in a field effect device",
    ", one uses an effective bohr radius @xmath8 which includes the dielectric constant @xmath9 of the medium in which the 2deg is created and the effective mass @xmath10 of the carriers .",
    "wigner was the first to consider the dilute limit where @xmath4 becomes large , the coulomb interactions dominate the kinetic energy in determining the wave function and the electrons tend to arrange themselves in a regular lattice .",
    "it may be argued that a lattice configuration is not consistent with the translational symmetry characterizing the 2deg hamiltonian in the absence of a random substrate .",
    "this objection can be removed by forming a new wave function which is a linear combination of all translations of the original lattice : the resultant wave function will have a uniform electronic charge density , as symmetry demands , with an unchanged energy .",
    "originally , wigner assumed a bcc electron lattice .",
    "it was later shown @xcite that the hexagonal lattice has a lowest electrostatic energy in two dimensions .    as explained in refs .",
    "@xcite , when one considers the hamiltonian of @xmath11 electrons in two dimensions , @xmath12 where the lengths are given in units of @xmath13 , the question has been from the early days to obtain the asymptotic behaviors of the ground state energy @xmath14 around the weak coupling limit ( @xmath15 ) : @xmath16 and around the strong coupling limit ( @xmath17 ) : @xmath18 to calculate the coefficients @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and to discuss the expected range of validity for those asymptotic expansions .",
    "then , one can try to numerically determine the value of @xmath4 where the weak coupling energy exceeds the large coupling energy .",
    "this can be done at the price of certain approximations which are controlled in the two limits and remain more uncertain in the middle , and after extrapolating finite size studies towards the thermodynamic limit .",
    "the most advanced works in this field are quantum monte carlo studies @xcite of systems involving many electrons ( typically more than @xmath21 ) and assuming two trial wave functions @xmath22 adapted to describe either the weak coupling limit , or the strong coupling limit .",
    "@xmath22 are of the slater - jastrow form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a slater determinant of extended plane waves for weak coupling , of localized single - particle orbitals for strong coupling .",
    "the liquid and crystal pseudopotentials @xmath25 are repulsive and include in an approximate way the effects of electronic correlations . then a simple variational approach , or a more involved fixed node greens - function approach , are used to obtain the energies @xmath26 dictated by the chosen @xmath22 or by its nodal structure .",
    "both the variational energies and the fixed node energies give an upper bound to the exact energy . comparing for intermediate @xmath4 the energies given by the @xmath22 adapted to describe the liquid and the crystal , one concludes @xcite that there is a first order quantum liquid - solid transition at @xmath27 , with a possible division @xcite of the liquid phase into a non polarized liquid at small @xmath4 and a polarized liquid for larger @xmath4 . however , the nature of the quantum mechanism of melting is still debated , and the possibility of a continuous transition has been very recently proposed@xcite . the solid is assumed to be a frustrated antiferromagnet@xcite before becoming ferromagnetic @xcite at very large @xmath4 .",
    "the same monte carlo method has been used@xcite in the presence of impurities .",
    "the conclusion was that disorder can stabilize the solid to weaker values of @xmath4 .",
    "andreev and lifshitz have discussed @xcite in 1969 the possibility to have a more complex intermediate state between the solid and the liquid , which should be neither a solid nor a liquid .",
    "two kinds of motion should be possible in it ; one possesses the properties of motion in an elastic solid , the second possesses the properties of motion in a liquid .",
    "this idea comes from a theory of defects in quantum solids .",
    "the nature of the relevant defects is a complicated issue .",
    "let us give a possible example : a vacancy yielded by one electron hopping from the wigner lattice towards some interstitial site . in a classical solid",
    ", this defect has a certain electrostatic cost and remains localized . in a quantum solid ,",
    "we have in addition the tunneling effect , and if this defect can be created , it will be delocalized since the system is invariant under translation .",
    "therefore , when @xmath4 decreases from the strong coupling limit , the increasing band width of the zero point defects of this type may exceed their decreasing electrostatic energy cost , leading to two possibilities for intermediate @xmath4 : either the total melting of the solid to directly give a liquid , as implicitely assumed for instance in refs .",
    "@xcite , or a quantum floppy solid coexisting with a liquid of delocalized defects , as conjectured by andreev and lifshitz . a phenomenological flt theory",
    " la landau of such gapless `` delocalized excitations '' of a floppy quantum solid has been later proposed in ref .",
    "the discussion of this second possibility is one of the central points of this chapter .",
    "a pure 2deg can be realized by trapping electrons on the surface of liquid helium , but it is difficult to reach a sufficient density to study the quantum regime .",
    "another possible realization is given by the new classes of superconducting cuprates where the electronic motion is essentially two dimensional .",
    "the charge density can be varied by chemical doping , and a complex phase diagram is obtained , with insulating , superconducting and metallic behaviors .",
    ".2 in    eventually , one can create a two dimensional gas of charges ( electrons or holes ) at the interface between two doped semiconductors ( gaas - algaas heterostructures ) , between a semi - conductor and an insulator ( si - mosfet ) , or very recently @xcite between an organic crystal ( pentacene , tetracene and anthracene ) and an insulator .",
    "the carrier density can be varied by a gate from a very dilute limit towards larger densities . in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we mention the remarkable phenomena observed in organic ( left ) or doped semi - conductor ( right ) field effect devices . a clean interface may give a high carrier mobility , may allow the observation @xcite of the fractional quantized hall effect ( fqhe ) and may give a measurable conductivity in a very dilute limit ( typically @xmath28 carriers per @xmath29 ) for gaas heterostructures and organic devices .",
    "if the effective mass of the carriers is large enough ( a condition which is not satisfied by the electrons in ga - as heterostructures ) the effective factor @xmath4 can be in the vicinity of the values where the fermi - wigner crossover is expected .",
    "one of the surprises in those high quality field effect transistors has been the observation of a metallic low temperature behavior @xcite in a certain intermediate range of carrier densities , where a large perpendicular magnetic field yields fqhe or magnetically induced wigner crystals @xcite .",
    "a recent review of the 2d - mit can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite with an extended list of references .",
    "we summarize by a few sketches some of the behaviors which have been observed , and which are useful for discussing our numerical results .",

    "a decay is the expected behavior for an insulator , while an increase usually characterizes a metal .",
    "these behaviors occur @xcite in a low temperature range @xmath36 , where @xmath37 are the typical fermi temperatures of those dilute 2degs .",
    "the temperature increase of @xmath30 can be large for a 2deg created in a si - mosfet ( typically one order of magnitude ) , but remains weak in a 2dhg created in a gaas heterostructure .",
    "for the densities @xmath3 where @xmath30 has a metallic behavior , a parallel field @xmath38 induces a large positive magnetoresistance which saturates above a certain field @xmath39 , as sketched in fig.[fig5 ] ( see fig . 1 of ref . @xcite and fig .",

    ", it was concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite that @xmath39 signals also the onset of full spin polarization .",
    "close to the mit , @xmath39 is very small and increases as @xmath40 above @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to the intermediate values of @xmath4 ( typically @xmath41 ) where the metallic behavior is observed .",

    "[ fig3 ] ( fig 2 of ref .",

    "( see inset of fig . 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    .2 in    in an ( undoped ) organic field effect transistor , the 2deg is less scattered by impurities and the mit is seen@xcite at an even smaller density ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "the surprise caused by this unexpected metallic behavior was mainly due to its discrepancy with the scaling theory of localization , which does not take into account electron - electron interactions .",
    "when the conductance @xmath47 is larger than the conductance quantum @xmath48 , a weak disorder perturbative expansion gives for the average conductance a universal logaritmic correction to the drude conductivity which defavors transport , unless there is a sufficient spin orbit scattering . in the weak disorder limit , one can also take into account the interaction when @xmath49 and one obtains additional corrections which reduce transport in a similar way .",
    "however , the extrapolation of the small @xmath4 interaction dependent correction to larger @xmath4 suggests a possible change of the sign of the corrections due to the interactions , indicating the possibility of a metallic phase in two dimensions , as mentioned by finkelshtein @xcite .",
    "computer calculations without interaction and transport measurements at not too low densities made in the eighties have confirmed the absence of metallic behavior in two dimensions .",
    "the difference between the recent experiments giving a mit and the former experiments confirming the absence of metallic behavior seems to be the quality of the interfaces at which the 2deg is created .",
    "this feature makes possible to have a measurable conductivity at much lower carrier densities than previously .",
    "an intermediate range of density , where the factor @xmath4 is too large ( too small ) to allow expansion in powers of @xmath4 ( @xmath50 ) and a weak elastic scattering seems to be necessary for observing the metallic behavior .",
    "this hypothesis was supported by ref .",
    "@xcite where a study of a 2dhg in a ga - as heterostructure gives a range @xmath51 for having a weak metallic behavior in a disordered sample .",
    "when @xmath52 , one would have weakly interacting quasi - particles dominated by anderson localization when the temperature @xmath53 .",
    "when @xmath54 , one would have a highly correlated set of charges . between @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the studied sample ,",
    "a problematic small metallic behavior is observed between two insulating behaviors of different nature ( anderson insulator for large densities , pinned wigner solid for low densities ) .",
    "the re - entrant mit at low @xmath4 is not easy to observe , if it exists , since the localization length of a clean device can be very large , and the observation of a possible re - entrant insulating behavior at high densities can require very low temperatures .",
    "this is why many observations of a mit have been reported for @xmath57 , while very few experiments give a possible re - entrant mit at @xmath58 .",
    "moreover , more recent works @xcite ) put doubts about the reality of this intermediate metallic behavior when the temperature goes to zero , since the effect of a weak perpendicular magnetic field can be described by usual weak localization theories , even for values of @xmath4 as large as @xmath59 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] taken from ref .",
    "the hypothesis of a certain temperature dependent screening was suggested for explaining the anomalous temperature dependence , and it was proposed that usual quantum interferences should drive at possibly very low temperatures the system to the formerly expected insulating behavior .",
    "recent measures performed down to @xmath60 do not confirm@xcite this hypothesis .",
    "the estimate of the phase breaking length @xmath61 which is traditionally done for estimating the low temperature dependence of the resistance from a zero temperature theory leads again to the famous problem of the saturation @xcite of @xmath61 when @xmath53 , problem leading also to many possible and controversial explanations .",
    ".2 in    in summary , a significant metallic behavior can be seen using a 2deg created in a si - mosfet , while a weaker one occurs in a 2dhg created in a si - ge quantum well or a ga - as hetrostructure .",
    "nevertheless , in the latter system , the study of the compressibility gives complementary signatures @xcite of a possible quantum phase transition .",
    "local compressibility measurements show that the system is more homogenous in the intermediate metallic phase than in the low density insulating phase . very recently , the possibility that the mit would be accompanied by a magnetic transition has been suggested @xcite .",

    "the energy spacing between the first and the second excited states is given by the difference of two particle - hole excitations and a poisson distribution follows if the low energy particle - hole excitations are uncorrelated .",
    "we note that the energy of an electron - hole pair is given by @xmath433 and the classical argument for the existence of a gap in the single particle density of states does not apply for the many - body spectrum@xcite .",
    "therefore the observed opening of a gap for the first energy excitation is a remarkable phenomenon beyond the predictions of the classical coulomb gap model .      in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied also the inverse compressibility @xmath434 i.e. the discretized second derivative of the ground state energy @xmath14 with respect to the number @xmath11 of particles .",
    "we consider @xmath435 particles on square lattices of size @xmath436 respectively , corresponding to a constant filling factor @xmath437 . here",

    "the following inverse compressibility data are obtained with the configuration interaction method .",
    "we have checked that the residual interaction does not change qualitatively hartree - fock results .",
    "indeed hf approximation gives in this weak coupling regime a good estimate of the ground state energy ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and the inverse compressibility is a physical observable which only depends on the ground state energies at different number of particles . neither a precise knowledge of the ground state wavefuction ( as in the calculation of persistent currents ) nor excited states energies ( as in studies of spectral statistics ) are required .",

    "[ fig - hf3 ] left shows the @xmath97-dependence of the average inverse compressibility , which is well fitted by the power law @xmath439 , with @xmath440 going from @xmath441 to @xmath418 when @xmath2 goes from @xmath131 to @xmath442 approximately . the value @xmath443 is expected without interaction ( @xmath444 , with @xmath445 single particle mean level spacing ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath446 , in this strongly localized regime , can be related to the coulomb gap in the single particle density of states @xcite : according to koopmans theorem ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for a thorough discussion about the limits of validity of the koopmans theorem for disordered quantum dots ) , one assumes that all the other charges are not reorganized by the addition of an extra charge , @xmath447 due to the coulomb gap , where @xmath448 is the energy of the @xmath449-th hf orbital at a fixed number @xmath11 of particles .    the distribution of inverse compressibilities , for @xmath450 and @xmath438 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - hf3 ] right . at @xmath196 , due to anderson localization , @xmath276 distributions are close to the poisson distribution ( deviations from the poisson distribution at small @xmath430 values are due to the finite system size ) . on the contrary , the distribution at @xmath451 shows a gaussian shape .",
    "this can be understood within the koopmans theorem , since the hf energies are given by @xmath452 with @xmath453 one - body part of the spinless hamiltonian and @xmath454 interaction matrix elements given by eq .",
    "( [ matel ] ) in appendix c. due to the small correlations of eigenfunctions in a random potential , one can reasonably invoke the central limit theorem ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "we point out that a gaussian - like distribution of inverse compressibilities has been observed in quantum dots experiments in the coulomb blockade regime @xcite .",
    "this implies that inverse compressibility fluctuations are dominated by interaction effects instead of single particle fluctuations .",
    "we note that the gaussian - like shape of the inverse compressibility distribution becomes more asymmetric when the disorder strength is increased .",
    "this asymmetry is due to the coulomb gap and has been discussed in the classical limit ( @xmath235 ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a simple model for the addition spectra of quantum dots has been recently proposed by b. shapiro @xcite .",
    "this model explains the change of the inverse compressibility distribution when @xmath4 increases assuming that the system can be decomposed into a stable n - electron wigner lattice plus a lattice of interstitial sites where the added particle can move and for which a usual single particle description is assumed .",
    "this suggests possible relations between the problem of adding an extra particle to a wigner solid and its melting when @xmath4 decreases .",
    "we have numerically revisited the quantum - classical crossover from the weak coupling fermi limit towards the strong coupling wigner limit , using small lattice models . in the continuous limit",
    ", the assumed picture @xcite is relatively simple : a liquid - solid first order transition for @xmath27 . for a clean lattice model at a filling factor @xmath271",
    ", our results raise the question of the possible existence of an intermediate liquid - solid phase as first proposed by andreev and lifshitz .",
    "this may also raise questions about the differences between the continuous limit and lattice models .",
    "when the spin degrees of freedom are included , our lattice model is a hubbard model with additional long range repulsions far from half filling .",
    "the physics of such models is not very well known , but at least suspected to be very rich and complex , as discussed in many works since the discovery of high @xmath455 superconductors .",
    "the role of the disorder is another source of complexity .",
    "we have divided this chapter in two main parts , the first where the disorder is weak , the second where the disorder is strong and makes the quantum kinetic effects less relevant .",
    "this raises also the question of the difference between the quantum wigner glass and the classical coulomb glass . for large disorder ,",
    "a finite size scaling analysis leads us to conclude that the weak coupling fermi phase is delimited by a second order quantum phase transition , when @xmath4 increases .    eventually , our first motivation was the experimental discovery of a possible new metal for intermediate values of @xmath4 .",
    "our numerical studies have not directly addressed the transport properties for intermediate @xmath4 .",
    "one can not claim that the observed intermediate regime gives a new metal in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nevertheless , if transport is mainly due to the presence of delocalized defects in a floppy and pinned electron solid for intermediate @xmath4 , it might be interesting to extend the flt theory  la landau proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite for a clean system to the case where one has also elastic scattering by impurities .",
    "it will tell us if a modified flt adapted to a very special fermi system with a non conventional fermi surface , still gives rise to usual quantum interferences leading to weak localization and eventually to anderson localization for the conjectured gapless excitations of a floppy solid .",
    "this could help to determine whether one has a true new metal for intermediate @xmath4 and weak disorder , or only an `` apparent '' metallic behavior which should disappear at the true @xmath53 limit .",
    "this might help to explain why in measurements down to @xmath60 in a gaas hetrostructure @xcite , the weak localization correction remains less than a few percent of the value predicted for a standard disordered @xmath406 fermi liquid .",
    "this is the usual mean field approximation when one has electron - electron interactions , which we shortly review for the case of spinless fermions .",
    "the hf ground state ( gs ) is the slater determinant ( sd ) which minimizes the gs energy expectation value . in the hf approximation ,",
    "one reduces the two - body part of the total hamiltonian to an effective single particle hamiltonian @xcite @xmath456 where @xmath457 stands for the expectation value with respect to the hf ground state , which has to be determined self - consistently .",
    "the first ( hartree ) term describes the interaction of any electron with the charge distribution set up by all the other electrons , while the latter ( fock ) term is a nonlocal exchange potential .",
    "the hartree term comes out as an extra on  site disorder potential , while the fock term introduces extra hopping amplitudes .",
    "the main advantage of the hartree - fock approximation is that it reproduces the single  particle density of states @xmath458 @xcite , particularly the coulomb gap near the fermi energy @xmath459 : in the two  dimensional case , @xmath460 @xcite .",
    "the physical argument underlying this relation is that an empty site @xmath461 and an occupied site @xmath68 with a difference in energy @xmath462 smaller than @xmath463 must be at a distance larger than @xmath464 as the change @xmath465 of the system energy must be positive when we consider an excitation starting from the ground state",
    ". however , the hf approximation gives a coulomb gap also in the delocalized regime at small disorder ( single particle localization length larger than the system size ) , where complicated many - body effects beyond hf approximation should screen coulomb interaction .",
    "ferromagnetic instabilities come from the interplay between coulomb repulsion and the pauli principle . in the pauli picture ,",
    "electrons populate the orbital states of a system , such as a quantum dot or a metallic grain , in a sequence of spin up - spin down electrons .",
    "the resulting minimum spin state minimizes the kinetic energy : it costs energy to flip a spin since it must be promoted to a higher energy level . on the other hand ,",
    "the maximum spin state requires a maximally antisymmetric coordinate wavefunction , thus reducing the effect of coulomb repulsion .",
    "this is at the basis of hund s rule for atoms : electrons occupy orbitals in an open shell so as to maximize their total spin .      in the hf approximation the interaction part of the hubbard hamiltonian ( [ hubbard ] )",
    "is reduced to @xmath467 the hf energies are given by @xmath468 with @xmath469 one - body eigenenergies and @xmath470 occupation numbers for the hf orbitals .",
    "the total ground state hf energy reads @xmath471    in order to study the stability of the nonmagnetic solution , @xmath472 with @xmath179 fermi level , we take a layer ( of thickness @xmath473 ) of electrons with spin down below the fermi level to put them in states with spin up @xcite .",
    "this changes the spin state of @xmath474 electrons per unit volume , where @xmath475 is the density of states per volume per spin .",
    "the change of the one - body energy density is given by @xmath476 in the clean case , the change of the interaction energy ( per volume ) is @xmath477 therefore the nonmagnetic state becomes unstable when @xmath478 , that is @xmath479 which gives the stoner criterion for ferromagnetic instability .    in the diffusive regime ,",
    "the effective interaction strength is enhanced by the presence of disorder , leading to ferromagnetic instabilities already below the stoner threshold , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we also note that stoner criterion predicts a ferromagnetic ground state for the hubbard model even at finite temperatures in one and in two dimensions , thus violating the mermin and wagner s theorem .",
    "therefore , when the stoner criterion ( [ stoner ] ) is satisfied , we can only conclude that the nonmagnetic ground state is unstable .",
    "the problem of a possible magnetization of the ground state is not only discussed in a dilute 2deg , but is also central in the studies of mesoscopic quantum dots since their ohmic resistances are measured as a function of a gate voltage in the coulomb blockade regime .",
    "the possibility of a spontaneous magnetization @xmath91 of their ground state due to electron - electron interactions has been proposed to explain the observed conductance peak spacing distributions .",
    "even though the approximations involved in the hf method are uncontrolled , the mean field hf results can be improved using a numerical method @xcite familiar in quantum chemistry as the configuration interaction method ( cim ) @xcite .",
    "once a complete orthonormal basis of hf orbitals has been calculated , @xmath480 , it is possible to build up a slater determinants basis for the many - body problem which can be truncated to the @xmath197 first slater determinants , ordered by increasing energies .",
    "the two - body hamiltonian can be written as @xmath481 with @xmath482 and @xmath483 .",
