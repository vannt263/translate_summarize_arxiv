    "inflationary paradigm was introduced to address problems and shortcomings related to the self - consistency of the cosmological standard model at early stages of its evolution @xcite .",
    "the inflationary mechanism can be achieved in several different ways considering primordial scalar fields or geometric corrections into the effective gravitational action .",
    "the general aim is to address problems like the initial singularity , the cosmological horizon , the cosmic microwave background isotropy ( and the related anisotropies generated , in principle , with initial quantum fluctuations ) , the large scale structure formation and evolution , the absence of magnetic monopoles and so on @xcite .",
    "the main ingredient of all these scenarios is to claim that an inflationary phase occurs at some stage in the early universe and that one or more sources , different from standard ordinary matter , give rise to accelerated cosmic expansion .",
    "such an expansion can be a single or a multiple event often related to the formation of structure at large and at very large scale .",
    "in general , inflationary scenarios originated from some fundamental theory like quantum gravity , strings , m - theory or gut models . reversing the argument , inflationary models and observables related to inflation",
    "can be used to probe fundamental theories ( see , for example the latest results of the planck and bicep2 collaborations @xcite ) .    in particular , quantum fluctuations of a given scalar field _",
    "i.e. _ the _ inflaton _ , gives a mechanism for the origin of large scale structure .",
    "in other words , inflation gives rise to density perturbations that exhibit a scale invariant spectrum .",
    "such a feature , in principle , is directly observed by measuring the temperature anisotropies in cosmic microwave background @xcite . a part the general features , the possibilities to realize inflation are several .",
    "for example , in the _",
    "old inflation _",
    ", inflaton is trapped in a false vacuum phase through a first order transition , while , in the _ new inflation _ , expansion ends up with a second order phase transition after a slow rolling phase @xcite . according to the problems to address ,",
    "there are several different inflationary models , for example the power law inflation , the hybrid inflation , the oscillating inflation , the trace - anomaly driven inflation , the @xmath7-inflation , the ghost - inflation , the tachyon inflation and so on @xcite .",
    "furthermore , some of these models have no potential minimum and the inflationary mechanism appears different with respect to the standard one . see for example the quintessential inflation @xcite or the tachyon inflation @xcite .    a natural way to achieve inflation is considering higher - order curvature corrections in the hilbert - einstein lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the first and well - known example of this approach is the starobinsky model @xcite where inflation is essentially driven by @xmath8 contributions , being @xmath2 the ricci curvature scalar .",
    "after this preliminary model , other higher - order curvature terms have been taken into account @xcite .",
    "the philosophy is that , in the early higher - curvature regime , such further curvature invariants come out as renormalization terms in quantum field theories in curved spacetime @xcite .",
    "furthermore , under conformal transformations , the theory becomes minimally coupled in the einstein frame . in this frame",
    ", the conformal scalar field assumes the role of _ inflaton _ and leads the primordial acceleration @xcite .",
    "however , more than one scalar field can be achieved by conformal transformations disentangling the degrees of freedom present in the jordan frame .",
    "several combinations of curvature invariants , like @xmath9 can be considered @xcite .",
    "the goal is to explain both the early and the late - time acceleration in a geometrical way @xcite without invoking huge amount of dark energy or , sometime , ill - defined scalar fields . among these attempt , a key role",
    "is played by the gauss - bonnet topological invariant @xmath10 that naturally arises in the process of quantum field theory regularization and renormalization in curved spacetime @xcite . in particular",
    ", it contributes to the trace anomaly where higher - order curvature terms are present @xcite . in some sense , considering a theory where both @xmath2 and @xmath11 are nonlinearly present exhausts the budget of curvature degrees of freedom needed to extend general relativity since the ricci scalar and both the ricci and the riemann tensors are present in the definition of @xmath10 . from the inflation point of view , introducing @xmath10 beside @xmath2 gives the opportunity to achieve a double inflationary scenario where the two acceleration phases are led by @xmath10 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "as we will see below , this happens as soon as both @xmath2 and @xmath10 appear in non - linear combinations since linear @xmath2 means just general relativity ( and then no inflation ) and linear @xmath10 identically vanishes in 4d gravitational action , being an invariant . on the other hand",
    ", the combination of both terms seems to improve the inflationary mechanism since one achieves a @xmath2-dominated phase and a @xmath10-dominated phase .",
    "the second leads the universe at very early stages of its evolution because @xmath10 is quadratic in curvature invariants and then it is dominant in stronger curvature regimes . specifically , using a non linear function of @xmath10 , inserted into the @xmath12 approach , that is a @xmath0 function , _ extends _ the starobinsky model since the whole curvature `` interactions '' , present in the early universe , are taken into account . in view of the recent results by the planck @xcite and bicep2 @xcite collaborations , the potential advantages of this class of models , with respect to the original starobinsky one",
    ", could be that curvature degrees of freedom ( in particular the scalaron @xmath2 ) result better constrained ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) .",
    "a first study in this sense is in the paper by ivanov and toporensky @xcite , where cosmological dynamics of fourth order gravity is studied in presence of gauss - bonnet term .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the possibility to obtain inflation considering a generic @xmath0 theory where , in principle , both @xmath2 and @xmath10 are non linear in the action .",
    "there are several recent studies on models of this type @xcite .",
    "all of them , put in evidence the fact that the gauss - bonnet topological invariant can solve some shortcomings of the original @xmath12 gravity and contributes , in non trivial way , to the accelerated expansion .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ due ] , we derive the field equations for @xmath13 .",
    "general features of @xmath13 cosmology and inflation are discussed in sec .",
