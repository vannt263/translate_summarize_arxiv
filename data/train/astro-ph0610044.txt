    "the corrected oxygen line ratios were used to estimate the oxygen abundance , @xmath54 , via the semi - empirical calibration of @xcite .",
    "next , @xmath55  was used to obtain an improved approximation of the hii region temperature using the theoretical correlations between electron temperature and oxygen abundance formulated by @xcite .",
    "the correlations are parameterized by the volume - averaged ionization parameter ( @xmath56 ) and the upper mass limit for the ionizing stars .",
    "however , in the oxygen abundance range inhabited by the reference hii regions ( @xmath57 ) , the relations converge to straight lines of nearly - identical slope with a spread of approximately @xmath58  k for intermediate values of @xmath56 , which are typical of observed hii regions @xcite .",

    "the column density of extragalactic gas in the foreground of an hii region can therefore be approximated as half the column density of hydrogen derived from observations of hi and co along the line of sight , with some scatter caused by deviations in position from the exact mid - plane and by concentrations of dust in the immediate vicinity of the hii region .",

    "the @xmath68  term is doubled to preserve the proportionality between the number of dust particles and hydrogen atoms .",

    "we have restricted our sample to galaxies for which ( 1 ) the galactic extinction is small and thus well - known ( i.e. , @xmath74  mag ) ; ( 2 ) the radial profile of hi has been determined from aperture synthesis maps ; and ( 3 ) there is a published radial profile of the co ( j=1 - 0 ) line .",
    "we have further required that the constituent hii regions be non - nuclear to insure the reliability of abundance calibrations , where `` non - nuclear '' is defined here as having a radius greater than 15% of the host galaxy s disk scale length .",
    "in addition , we have rejected any hii region located beyond the radial boundaries of the hi maps .",
    "lastly , all hii regions were required to have measurements of the flux at @xmath18  and @xmath19as well as the equivalent width of the @xmath19  emission line in order to account for the depression of balmer emission by underlying balmer absorption from stars ( for typical hii regions , the equivalent width of @xmath18  emission is so strong that the correction to the @xmath18  flux is negligible ) .",
    "the galaxies meeting the above criteria are listed in table  [ tabspi ] .",
    "the total extinctions of the reference hii regions were derived in a manner consistent with those employed for maffei  2 and ic  342 ( see   [ s_extot ] ) .",
    "several of the hii regions were missing measurements for the oxygen line fluxes as a consequence of poor signal - to - noise .",
    "their temperatures were determined from a correlation between temperature and galactocentric radius found for the hii regions for which oxygen line fluxes were available . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ figtr ] , the slope and intercept of the correlation appear to have a dependence on spiral morphology in the sense that hii regions in late - type spirals have higher temperatures .",
    "we therefore adopt two linear fits ; one for the spirals of type sbc and one for those of type scd .",

    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) deviations for the sbc and scd samples are 562  k and 934  k , respectively .",
    "the extragalactic extinction of each hii region ( quantified by @xmath78 ) was extracted from the total extinction ( @xmath79 ) observed in the balmer decrement ( eq .  [ eqtau ] ) by subtracting the galactic extinction ( @xmath80 ) derived from the galactic reddenings of ( * ? ? ?",

    "the greatest source of uncertainty in a measurement of @xmath82arises from taking the annular average of intensity measurements at a given radius .",
    "the uncertainty increases with distance from the nucleus ; the larger the circumference of an annulus , the larger the area of galaxy contained within the annulus , and therefore the greater the possibility of intensity fluctuations .",

    ", the difference between the column densities within each semi - annulus ( @xmath92 ) relative to the mean ( @xmath93 ) is found to be a linear function of the fractional galactocentric radius @xmath77 , with an rms deviation of 0.16 .",

    "this latter source is dominated by the scatter of @xmath96 in the adopted metallicity relation ( see   [ s_gas ] ) and the measurement uncertainty in the oxygen abundance , for which we adopt 0.2 dex as recommended by @xcite . taking the above sources into account",

    "we note that the mean measurement uncertainty in @xmath82for the sbc galaxies exceeds that found for the scd galaxies by 6% , as a result of the considerably larger uncertainties in @xmath68 .",

    "the contributions from the uncertainties in the reddening coefficients were found to be negligible . adopting a 0.16 fractional error in @xmath80as recommended by sfd ,",
    "the mean measurement uncertainty in @xmath78  for the reference hii regions is 0.10 .",

    "we therefore have no reason to reject the sfd value of @xmath80  for this galaxy , so we adopt the weighted mean of both values , which yields @xmath110 .    the extinction parameters and corrected magnitudes of maffei  2 and ic  342 are given in table  [ tabprop ] .",
    "the lower values of the reddening coefficients @xmath111 observed for maffei  2 for each broadband filter @xmath112 are due to shifts in the effective wavelengths of @xmath112 towards the red caused by the higher galactic extinction and inclination .",
    "as explained in   [ s_extot ] and   [ s_gasdust ] , analyses in this paper are founded upon a modern framework for handling extinction which eliminates the biases that accompany traditional approaches . as a consequence , zero - points for distance indicators employed in the hst key project on the extragalactic distance scale ( hereafter @xcite )",
    "must be updated using the same approach .",
    "specifically , revised distances are required to the ursa major cluster , which defines the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation employed here , and to the coma cluster , which defines the fundamental plane ( fp ) used to determine the distance of maffei 1 in @xcite .    behind the tf and fp calibrations",

    "the period - luminosity ( pl ) relations for the lmc must be re - visited .",
    "the @xcite pl relations come from @xcite , and the extinction corrections inherent to the pl relations , which are based on the apparent magnitude of the red clump , are those of @xcite .",
    "@xcite presumed that the red clump has a constant absolute magnitude in cousins @xmath8 ( henceforth @xmath113 ) , and that changes in apparent magnitude are due to fluctuations in extinction with respect to some zero - point .",
    "the zero - point was determined from colour - magnitude diagrams for an eclipsing binary ( hv 2274 ) and for two young open clusters .",
    "it appears that a reddening law for the lmc @xcite was used to define @xmath31 for each of these sources ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the determination of corrections to @xmath31 from red - clump magnitude fluctuations and the conversion of total reddenings to extinctions in @xmath13 and @xmath113 were based upon extinction coefficients tabulated by @xcite , which are founded upon the broadband reddening law of @xcite for the milky way .    fortunately , the mean reddening of the cepheids behind the @xcite pl relations , @xmath114  mag ( range 0.11 to 0.20 mag ) , is very close to the value measured for the objects defining the zero - point ( 0.13 to 0.15 mag ) .",
    "this means that red - clump adjustments to the cepheid extinctions amount to second - order corrections , and any errors in these adjustments ought to average out .",
    "thus , red clump stars are of less concern than the matter of what sets the zero - point .",
    "the reddening that @xcite adopted for the binary was @xmath115  mag @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite derived @xmath116  mag by simultaneously solving for atmospheric temperatures and the interstellar extinction curve . in making their determination , @xcite incorporated photometry from @xcite .",
    "this removed the reddening degeneracy which afflicted a preliminary determination criticized by @xcite .",
    "the result of @xcite has to be taken very seriously because the sed , reddening law , and colour excess are not only consistent with the lmc environment , but also consistent with each other .",
    "it is concluded that the @xmath31 scale of @xcite is too high by @xmath117 .    correcting for the change in the reddening zero - point",

    "thus , @xmath2  mag for maffei  2 and @xmath6  mag for ic  342 .",
    "the reddening coefficients used in this analysis were computed by the york extinction solver ( yes ) , which accounts for the colour - dependent shifts in the effective wavelengths of broadband filters .      to determine the distance to maffei  2 ,",
    "we have formulated the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation in @xmath8 using rotation curves instead of hi line widths as the luminosity diagnostic , as line widths for nearby galaxies like maffei  2 can be unreliable due to contamination by galactic hi . the tf distance",
    "to maffei  2 is found to be @xmath7  mpc , where the zero - point is set by the maser distance to ngc  4258 . using the extinction treatment and distance scale adopted in this paper , we re - derive the cepheid distance to ic  342 @xcite and the fundamental plane distance to maffei  1 @xcite , obtaining @xmath237  mpc and @xmath230  mpc , respectively .",
    "the revised distances and magnitudes reveal that the ic  342/maffei group is dominated by three giant galaxies with nearly identical luminosities .",
    "further , the average distance to the three galaxies is in excellent agreement with expectations for the hubble flow , making it highly unlikely that these galaxies interacted with the local group since the big bang .",
