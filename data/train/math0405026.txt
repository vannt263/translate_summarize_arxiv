    "we consider real planar polynomial differential system , i.e. systems of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are polynomials in @xmath3 and @xmath4 with real coefficients ( @xmath5 $ ] ) . in this article , a system of the above form with @xmath6 will be called quadratic .    these are the simplest nonlinear differential systems . however , global problems regarding this class are difficult to solve . in 1900",
    "hilbert gave his list of 23 problems and one of the few of them still unsolved , the second part of hilbert s 16th problem , is on planar polynomial systems .",
    "this problem which asks for the maximum h(n ) of the numbers of limit cycles occurring in differential systems with @xmath7 ( for a discussion of this problem cf .",
    "@xcite ) , is still unsolved even for quadratic differential systems .",
    "the interest is in the global behavior of all solutions in the whole plane and even at infinity ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and this for a whole family of systems , which is why this problem is so hard .",
    "the set of quadratic differential systems depends on 12 parameters , the coefficients of the two polynomials @xmath1 and @xmath2 . on acts the group of affine transformations and of changes of scale on the time axis .",
    "so the space actually depends on five parameters .",
    "but even five is a large number considering that we expect this class to yield thousands of distinct phase portraits .",
    "for this reason people have attempted to study particular classes of quadratic systems and for some classes a complete classification of phase portraits with respect to topological equivalence was obtained ( quadratic systems with a center @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , quadratic hamiltonian systems @xcite , @xcite , quadratic chordal systems @xcite , quadratic systems with a weak focus of third order @xcite and @xcite , etc . ) .",
    "the goal in most of these articles was to obtain all topologically distinct phase portraits for the particular class considered .",
    "two systems ( @xmath8 ) and ( @xmath9 ) are topologically equivalent if there exists a homeomorphism @xmath10 such that @xmath11 carries orbits to orbits preserving ( or reversing ) their orientation . in most articles ,",
    "the classifications were done by using specific charts and normal forms for the systems in these charts with respect to parameters satisfying certain inequalities or equations .",
    "the results are not readily applicable for systems given in normal forms with respect to other charts .",
    "this dependence on a specific normal form yields results which are not geometric .",
    "indeed , ever since klein gave his famous erlangen program , we are used to calling a property geometric , if it is invariant under the action of some group . in this sense ,",
    "most of the results obtained are not geometrical since they are not independent of the charts considered .",
    "the orbit space of under the group action is five - dimensional .",
    "the global study of the class makes it necessary to use normal forms in several charts . to obtain the global picture",
    ", we need to be able to glue these charts and for this gluing process invariants are helpful . furthermore in work in progress on this space , invariants are very helpful even in choosing the charts .    chart independent classification results were obtained by k.s .",
    "sibirsky and his school ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) using the algebraic invariant theory of differential equations developed by sibirsky and his disciples ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "however most of the articles of the school of sibirsky were published in russian , only some appeared in translations which partly explains why this theory is rather unknown in the west . in these articles , invariants and comitants",
    "are introduced in their multi - index tensorial form , certain rather artificial polynomial combinations of these are chosen and classifications are given in terms of these combinations . in the end",
    "these classifications remain insufficiently related to the geometry of the systems .",
    "we need much simpler invariants , simpler than the configuration space of markus ( cf.@xcite ) , possibly even integer valued invariants which could convey to us in simple terms properties of the global geometry of the systems",
    ". we would also need a way of computing at least some of these simple invariants for any system in whatever chart it may be given to us .",
    "in @xcite , @xcite the authors gave topological classifications in terms of the global geometry of the classes of systems considered .",
    "these classifications are affinely invariant and they are expressed in @xcite in terms of the geometry of algebraic invariant curves of the systems considered or in terms of very simple integer - valued invariants in @xcite and @xcite reflecting the geometry of the systems .",
    "there is however a need to have an efficient way of effectively computing , independent of charts these simpler integer - valued , geometric invariants .    in spite of their awesome character , polynomial invariants and comitants",
    "are a very powerful computational tool applicable to any canonical form and they can be programmed on a computer . there is thus a need to merge the geometric methods above mentioned with the algebraic invariant approach . in this work",
    "we propose to do just that for the specific problem of classifying topologically quadratic systems in the neighbourhood of infinity .    in @xcite kooij and reyn",
    "obtained all possible local phase portraits around a single singular point at infinity of an arbitrary quadratic vector field .",
    "in @xcite they did not consider the possible ways of combining such singularities so as to obtain a topological classification of quadratic systems in a neighborhood of the line at infinity . in @xcite i.",
    "nicolaev and n.  vulpe obtained such a classification in terms of algebraic invariants and comitants and in @xcite the affine invariant classification of quadratic system with respect to the possible distributions of the multiplicities of singularities at infinity was obtained by v.baltag and n.vulpe @xcite .",
    "these classifications use the technical language of algebraic invariant theory developed by the school of sibirsky ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , etc ) .",
    "the goal of this work is to combine the geometric approach in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite with the algebraic invariant approach in @xcite and @xcite for the topological classification of quadratic systems in the neighborhood of infinity .",
    "we need simplicity and clarity in the geometric classification as well as applicability to any particularly chosen chart . in this article , which is based on @xcite",
    "we introduce the notions and prove the necessary results which permit this in as self - contained a way as possible .",
    "we also point out that in the attempt to merge the geometric invariants with the algebraic ones , the geometry led us to simpler algebraic invariants than those in @xcite yielding simpler conditions in the classification theorem [ th_2 ] .",
    "this work could be applied along with an analogous one for finite singularities , as an initial step , to the problem of classifying all quadratic differential systems .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in  2 we consider the two compactifications of real planar polynomial systems and the foliations with singularities , real and complex , on the real and complex projective planes , associated to these systems .    in  3",
    "we describe the purely geometric objects , i.e. the divisors attached to the line at infinity , introduced in @xcite , which encode the multiplicities at infinity of the systems , and attach to these some integer - valued global affine invariants .    in  4 we consider group actions on quadratic differential systems and define algebraic invariants and comitants with respect to these group actions .",
    "we also give , using a comitant , canonical forms for these differential systems according to their behavior at infinity .    in  5 we state and prove the classification theorem ( theorem  [ th_1 ] ) of the quadratic differential systems according to their multiplicity divisors at infinity and for each class we give the necessary and sufficient conditions in terms of algebraic invariants and comitants with respect to the group action .",
    "these conditions allow us to compute for any system and in any chart the types of the multiplicity divisors associated to the system .    in  6",
    "we introduce new classifying tools , among them the index divisor encoding globally the topological indices of the singularities at infinity of any polynomial differential system without a line of singularities at infinity .",
    "we also introduce a divisor encoding globally the number of local separatrices bounding a hyperbolic sector of a singular point at infinity .    in  7",
    "we state and prove the topological classification theorem ( theorem [ th_2 ] ) .",
    "this classification is expressed on one side in terms of geometrical , affine integer - valued invariants , which convey in simple terms the geometric and dynamic properties of the systems according to their behavior in the vicinity of infinity ; on the other hand in terms of algebraic invariants and comitants . in the end we are able to read for any system and in any chart , its geometric and dynamical properties at infinity once these algebraic invariants and comitants are calculated .",
    "these calculations could be done on a computer .",
    "a complete dictionary of integer - valued geometric invariants and polynomial invariants is given .",
    "in the appendix we list the invariants and comitants used in @xcite and which are needed for the proofs of the main results .",
    "these are also listed for the purpose of comparison with the simpler algebraic invariants and comitants used in this article . highlighting the geometry of the systems via the integer - valued invariants introduced , helped us to choose better algebraic invariants and comitants than those in @xcite , closer to the geometry of the systems",
