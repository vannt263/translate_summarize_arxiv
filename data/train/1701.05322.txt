    "recently , various topological systems are actively studied in the field of condensed matter physics .",
    "after theoretical proposals of the quantum spin hall system @xcite , various topological systems have been theoretically predicted or experimentally observed in real materials . in particular , a weyl semimetal ( wsm ) which belongs to a class of topological semimetals has been proposed @xcite .",
    "a wsm has dirac cones without spin degeneracy at or near the fermi energy .",
    "it can not be realized unless the time - reversal symmetry or the inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "the vertex of the dirac - cone dispersion is called a weyl node , and it can be regarded as a monopole or an anti - monopole for the berry curvature field in the wavevector space @xcite .",

    "a ti - ni multilayer with broken inversion symmetry by an electric field has also been proposed to show the wsm phase by tuning some parameters , for example the thickness of the layers in the multilayer of hgte / cdte @xcite .",
    "in addition , physical properties of multilayers of a ti and a ni have been investigated theoretically @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study multilayers of a wsm and a ni , which has not been studied thus far , to the authors knowledge .",
    "we find that the resulting phase diagrams show rich physics , including the quantum anomalous hall ( qah ) phases with various values of the chern number .",
    "the phase diagrams are qualitatively different depending on the stacking direction of the multilayers relative to the displacement vector between the weyl nodes .",
    "therefore , we focus on two patterns of stacking directions , patterns a and b shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ( b ) and ( c ) , and calculate the phase diagrams of patterns a and b separately . in the calculation , we use an effective model and a lattice model , and their results well agree . in the multilayer with pattern",

    "b , the phase diagram contains a ni , a wsm and qah phases , depending on the thicknesses of the two constituent layers .",
    "the chern number of the qah phases becomes larger and larger when the superlattice periodicity becomes larger .",
    "this result offers us a way to design qah systems in a wsm - ni multilayer in a controlled way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we calculate phase diagrams of multilayers for patterns a and b from the effective model for a wsm .",

    "in our calculation on multilayers , we use the effective model for a wsm proposed in ref .  .",
    "the model describes both a wsm and a ni by changing a single parameter @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is a @xmath10 matrix @xmath11 , which acts on a space consisting of a single conduction band and a single valence band .",
    "the @xmath10 hamiltonian @xmath11 is given by @xmath12    where @xmath13 are the pauli matrices , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are nonzero constants .",
    "we choose them to be positive for simplicity .",
    "energy eigenvalues of the system are given by @xmath16    we assume that the fermi energy is at @xmath17 . when @xmath18 , the system is an insulator with the bulk gap @xmath19 .",
    "on the other hand , when @xmath20 , the system is a wsm .",
    "the bulk gap closes at two weyl nodes @xmath21 , which are a monopole and an antimonopole for the berry curvature field .",
    "surface fermi arcs of a wsm are also described within this model @xcite . in order to show the surface states , we consider two types of surfaces of a slab ; a top surface and a bottom surface , perpendicular to the @xmath22 direction .",
    "the top surface represents the @xmath23 surface where the @xmath24 region is a wsm with @xmath20 and the @xmath25 region is the vacuum with @xmath18 .",
    "similarly , the bottom surface represents the @xmath23 surface where the @xmath25 region is a wsm and the @xmath24 region is the vacuum . as shown in ref .  , surface states exist both on the top and the bottom surfaces within @xmath26 .",
    "these surface states form fermi arcs .",
    "in particular , at @xmath17 , the surface states at each surface are located at @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and they connect the weyl nodes projected on the @xmath28 plane .",
    "as mentioned earlier , a wsm is realized only when either the time - reversal symmetry or the inversion symmetry is broken .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) itself preserves the inversion symmetry but breaks the time - reversal symmetry .",

    "when @xmath37 , the gap at @xmath38 closes at    @xmath39    and they are shown to be the weyl nodes .",

[ fig2 ] ( a ) . in the phase diagram , the wsm phase periodically appears as the thickness of the wsm layer varies , and two phases which sandwich the wsm phase are the qah phases with different values of the chern number .",

    "[ fig5 ] ( c ) ) confirms this scenario .",
    "furthermore , we can apply the scenario of the mixing of the fermi arcs not only in pattern a but also in pattern b. in pattern b , the fermi arcs in the wsm layer are folded down into the first brillouin zone due to the periodic stacking .",
    "it gives rise to multiple chiral surface states circulating along the @xmath148 plane . as a result ,",
    "the qah phase appears on the phase diagrams ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ( b ) and fig .  [ fig6 ] ( a ) )",

    "wsm - ni multilayers have not been studied previously . on the other hand ,",
    "the wsm phase is found to appear in a ti - ni multilayer with magnetization @xcite and in a staked qah layers system @xcite . in the phase diagrams of these two cases ( ti - ni multilayer and stacked qah layers system )",
    ", the wsm phase appears between the ni and the qah phases . by changing system parameters",
    ", one can go through ni - wsm - qah phase transitions . here",
    ", the wsm can be seen as an incomplete version of the qah ; namely , at some 2d slices in @xmath149 space the chern number is zero , while at others the chern number is nontrivial . in this sense",
    ", our finding of an appearance of the qah phase in the wsm - ni multilayer is nontrivial .",
    "as stated in the previous paragraph , the emergent qah phase in pattern b is understood from the folding of the brillouin zone by periodicity of the multilayer .    in this paper , we consider the wsm with broken time - reversal symmetry .",
    "there are a number of materials proposed as wsms with broken time - reversal symmetry : pyrochlore iridates @xcite , coti@xmath1x ( x = si , ge , sn ) @xcite zrco@xmath1sn @xcite , hg@xmath5cd@xmath2mn@xmath6te in a magnetic field @xcite , and bi@xmath7sb@xmath8 in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the number of weyl nodes , @xmath150 , takes various even numbers in these wsms . in wsms with @xmath151 , such as hg@xmath5cd@xmath2mn@xmath6te under a magnetic field @xcite , hgcr@xmath1se@xmath152 @xcite , and bi@xmath7sb@xmath8 under a magnetic field @xcite , there are only a pair of weyl nodes around the fermi energy .",
    "the present theory is directly applied , if the multilayer is either of the two patterns a and b ; i.e. stacking vector @xmath153 , defined as a normal direction of individual layers , is either perpendicular or parallel to the displacement vector @xmath154 between the two weyl nodes .",
    "as we have discussed , in pattern a ( @xmath155 ) , the weyl nodes approach each other by making a multilayer , and in pattern b ( @xmath156 ) , the @xmath149 space is folded into the brillouin zone by the periodicity of the multilayer and becomes the wsm , the ni or the qah phases depending on the thicknesses of the two layers .    in the wsm with @xmath151",
    ", one can think of general multilayers , where the two vectors @xmath153 and @xmath154 are neither parallel nor perpendicular .",
    "such general cases can be understood by a combination of patterns a and b. in the direction perpendicular to the stacking vector @xmath153 , the weyl nodes approach each other , while along the stacking vector @xmath153 , the @xmath149 space is folded into the small brillouin zone .",
    "thus the displacement vector between the weyl nodes becomes gradually parallel as we increase @xmath157 .",
    "as long as @xmath153 is not parallel to the displacement vector between the weyl nodes , the weyl nodes have no chance of pair annihilation , and the system is in the wsm phase . then , when @xmath157 exceeds a critical value , as is similar to pattern a , the displacement vector between the weyl nodes becomes parallel to @xmath153 , and the multilayer may exhibit the qah , the wsm , or the ni phases .",
    "the detailed behavior of the phases as a function of the thicknesses @xmath42 and @xmath45 depends on details of the system , and is left as a future work .    in the other wsms with broken time - reversal symmetry having @xmath158 , the phase diagram for the multilayers can be discussed in a similar way , and the resulting phase diagram will become complicated . nevertheless , based on the above analysis , one can say that possible phases are either a ni , a wsm , or a qah phases , because the layered structure folds the fermi arcs into the brillouin zone of the multilayer . in general",
    ", a longer periodicity in the superlattice direction gives rise to larger chern number , because the fermi arcs are folded down many times .",
    "an extension to the wsm without the inversion symmetry is beyond the scope of the present work , as the symmetry of the systems is very different .",
    "there are at least four weyl nodes , and when the folding of the brillouin zone gives rise to pair annihilations of all the weyl nodes , it is expected to lead to either a ni or a weak ti phases .",
    "nevertheless , the way how the fermi arcs connect the four weyl nodes depends on surface termination @xcite ; therefore , a discussion from a viewpoint of fermi arcs is not straightforward , and is left as a future work .",
