    "we present a theoretical and numerical study of imaging remote sources in random waveguides , using an array of sensors that record acoustic waves .",
    "the waveguide effect is caused by the boundary of the cross - section , which traps the waves and guides the energy along the range direction @xmath0 , as illustrated in figure [ fig : schem ] .",
    "we restrict our study to two - dimensional waveguides , because the numerical simulations become prohibitively expensive in three dimensions .",
    "the results are similar in three - dimensional waveguides with bounded cross - section .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an analysis of wave propagation and imaging in three - dimensional random waveguides with unbounded cross - section .",
    "scattering at the boundary creates multiple traveling paths of the waves from the source to the receiver array .",
    "mathematically , we can write the wave field @xmath1 ( the acoustic pressure ) as a superposition of a countable set of waveguide modes , which are solutions of the homogeneous wave equation . finitely many modes propagate in the range direction at different speeds , and the remaining infinitely many modes are evanescent waves that decay exponentially with range",
    ". we may associate the propagating modes with planar waves that strike the boundaries at different angles of incidence .",
    "the slow modes correspond to near normal incidence .",
    "they reflect repeatedly at the boundary , thus traveling a long path to the array .",
    "the fast modes correspond to small grazing angles and shorter paths to the array .    in ideal waveguides with straight boundaries and",
    "wave speed that is constant or varies smoothly with cross - range , the wave equation is separable and the modes are uncoupled . in particular , each mode has a constant amplitude which is determined by the source excitation .",
    "we study perturbed waveguides with small and rapid fluctuations of the boundaries and of the wave speed , due to numerous weak inhomogeneities .",
    "such fluctuations are not known and are of no interest in imaging .",
    "however , they can not be neglected because they cause wave scattering that accumulates over long distances of propagation . to address the uncertainty of the boundary and wave speed fluctuations , we model them with random processes , and thus speak of random waveguides .",
    "the array measures one realization of the random field @xmath1 , the solution of the wave equation in one realization of the random waveguide .",
    "that is to say , for a particular perturbed boundary and medium .",
    "when cumulative scattering by the perturbations is significant , the measurements are quite different from those in ideal waveguides .",
    "furthermore , if we could repeat the experiment for many realizations of the perturbations , we would see that the measurements change unpredictably , they are statistically unstable .    the expectation ( statistical mean ) @xmath2 $ ] of the wave is called the _ coherent _ field .",
    "this is the part of the data that is useful for coherent imaging , because we can relate it to the unknown location of the source , in spite of the uncertainty of the perturbations in the waveguide .",
    "the challenge is to process the data in order to enhance the coherent part @xmath2 $ ] and mitigate the unwanted reverberations @xmath3 $ ] , the _ incoherent _ part .",
    "coherent methods without such processing give images that are difficult to interpret and unreliable .",
    "they change unpredictably with the realization of the random waveguide , they are not statistically stable .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a rigorous asymptotic stochastic analysis of the wave field @xmath1 in waveguides with randomly perturbed boundaries , and to @xcite for waveguides with randomly perturbed media .",
    "the analysis shows that @xmath1 can be modeled as a superposition of ideal waveguide modes that are coupled by scattering at the random perturbations .",
    "explicitly , the modes have amplitudes that are random functions of frequency and range , and satisfy a coupled system of stochastic differential equations .",
    "their expectations decay exponentially with range , on mode- and frequency - dependent length scales called _ scattering mean free paths_. the decay means that the incoherent fluctuations of the amplitudes gain strength , and once they become dominant , the modes should not be used in coherent imaging .",
    "it is not surprising that the scattering mean free paths are longer for the fast propagating modes than the slower ones .",
    "this is because the latter are waves that take longer trajectories from the source to the array , and interact more with the perturbations of the boundaries and the medium .",
    "we show in this paper that a successful imaging strategy depends on which perturbations play the dominant role in the waveguide .",
    "if scattering from perturbed boundaries dominates , the fast modes have a much longer scattering mean free path than the slower modes .",
    "therefore , the data remain partially coherent at long ranges and we can seek an adaptive imaging approach that detects the slow modes with incoherent amplitudes and suppresses them .",
    "the longer the range , the fewer the modes that remain coherent , so there is a trade - off between the statistical stability and the resolution of the images , which can be optimized with the adaptive method .    when we compare the effect of perturbed boundaries to that of perturbed media , for similar amplitude and correlation length of the fluctuations , we find two essential differences : the latter gives much shorter scattering mean free paths for the faster modes , and the rate of change of these scales with the mode index is much slower .",
    "there is no trade - off between statistical stability and resolution of coherent images in such waveguides . as the range increases ,",
    "the mode amplitudes become incoherent on roughly the same range scale , so there is no gain in removing the slow modes .",
    "coherent imaging fails and should be replaced by incoherent methods , based on transport equations for the energy resolved locally in time and over the modes i.e. , over the direction of propagation of the associated plane waves .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an example of incoherent imaging in random waveguides .",
    "these methods are more complex and computationally involved than the coherent ones .",
    "they are designed to work at ranges that exceed the scattering mean free paths , but they also fail when the source is further from the array than the _ equipartition distance_. this is the range scale over which the energy of the wave becomes distributed uniformly over the modes , independent of the source excitation .",
    "the waves scatter so much while they travel this distance that they lose all information of their initial state , thus making imaging impossible .    we show that in waveguides with interior inhomogeneities the equipartition distance is much longer than the scattering mean free path of the modes , so there is an observable range interval over which coherent imaging fails , but incoherent imaging succeeds .",
    "this is not the case for waveguides with perturbed boundaries where the equipartition distance is almost the same as the scattering mean free path of the fast modes .",
    "when coherent imaging fails in such waveguides , no imaging method can succeed , so there is no advantage in using the more complex , incoherent approaches .",
    "the adaptive coherent imaging method proposed in this paper is based on a figure of merit of the quality of the image , which accounts for the trade - off between its statistical stability and resolution .",
    "there are many such figures of merit .",
    "we choose one that is simple and serves our purpose . in practice",
    ", it may be improved for example by incorporating prior information about the support of the source distribution .",
    "the method searches for weights of the data decomposed over the waveguide modes , in order to optimize the figure of merit .",
    "we apply the results of the asymptotic stochastic analysis in @xcite to derive theoretically the weights , and show that they are in good agreement with those from the numerical simulations in waveguides with random boundaries .",
    "we also show that coherent imaging fails in random waveguides with interior inhomogeneities , as predicted by the theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin in section [ sect : form ] with the formulation of the problem .",
    "then we describe in section [ sect : model ] the model of the array data in ideal and randomly perturbed waveguides .",
