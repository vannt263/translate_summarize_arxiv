    "as is well known , the _ trace distance _ and the _ bures fidelity _ are two important distance measures for quantum computation and quantum information [ 1 - 7 ] . a qubit is completely described by the @xmath0 density matrix as    @xmath1    where @xmath2 is the unit matrix , @xmath3 the pauli matrices vector , and @xmath4 the bloch vector .",
    "@xmath5 corresponds to a pure state , otherwise a mixed state .",
    "let    @xmath6    be two states of a qubit .",
    "the trace distance and the bures fidelity between @xmath7 and @xmath8 are given by the following equations @xmath9",
    "@xmath10 ^ 2 .",
    "\\label{t4}\\ ] ] one can easily obtain @xmath11 namely , the trace distance between two single qubit states has a simple geometric interpretation as half the ordinary euclidean distance between points on the bloch sphere . however , no similarly clear geometric interpretation is known for the bures fidelity between two states of a qubit [ 7 ] . the purpose of this brief report is to provide a geometric observation for the bures fidelity for the case of a qubit . in sec .",
    "ii , a definite geometric relation is formulated for the bures fidelity in terms of _ hyperbolic parameters_. conclusion is made in the last section .",
    "* theorem : * the bures fidelity between states @xmath7 and @xmath8 is equal to    @xmath12    where @xmath13 @xmath14 are rapidities .",
    "* proof : * let us introduce the hyperbolic parameter @xmath15 to represent the bloch vector as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a unit vector .",
    "it is easy to check @xmath18 because of @xmath19 ; @xmath20 corresponds to @xmath21 , while @xmath22 corresponds to @xmath23 . in other words ,",
    "( [ t7 ] ) is a one - to - one mapping between @xmath24 and @xmath25 .    at this moment",
    ", the density matrix @xmath26 can be rewritten as @xmath27 it is not difficult to observe that the relation between the density matrix @xmath26 and the lorentz boost matrix @xmath28 is @xmath29 obviously , @xmath26 and @xmath30 are in one - to - one correspondence . for the former ,",
    "the physical meaning of the vector @xmath25 is the bloch vector in quantum mechanics , while for the latter the relativistic velocity . due to the rapidity @xmath31 , i.e. , the hyperbolic angle ,",
    "special relativity can be formulated in terms of hyperbolic geometry .",
    "consequently , some physical quantities have been found to have geometric meanings , such as the thomas rotation angle ( sometimes also called the wigner angle ) corresponds to the defect of a hyperbolic triangle [ 8,9 ] .",
    "since @xmath26 and @xmath30 are in one - to - one correspondence , we are led to view the bloch vector @xmath25 as an analogous relativistic velocity , and the angle @xmath32 as the rapidity .",
    "motivated by this , we will find out a geometric interpretation for the quantum fidelity @xmath33 in the framework of hyperbolic geometry .    from the addition law of velocities in special relativity",
    ": @xmath34 ,   \\label{t10}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 is the lorentz factor and @xmath36 is the speed of light in vacuum space , we have @xmath37 or @xmath38 which is the cosin - law in the hyperbolic geometry .    from eq.([t9 ] ) , one obtains @xmath39 .",
    "\\label{t13}\\ ] ] from @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 so that @xmath42 thus the bures fidelity is @xmath43 this ends the proof .",
    "in fig . 1 , we draw a hyperbolic triangle @xmath44 formed by three hyperbolic angles @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the midpoint of the side @xmath47 .",
    "as one can see that the trace distance @xmath48 is related to an ordinary euclidean triangle , whose three sides are @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ; similarly , the bures fidelity is related to a hyperbolic triangle , it is a multiplication of the ratio @xmath52 and the ratio @xmath53 . from eq .",
    "( [ t16 ] ) , one easily sees that @xmath54 is symmetric in its inputs , i.e. , @xmath55 , and is invariant under unitary transformations on the state space .",
    "in conclusion , we have presented a geometric observation for the bures fidelity between two states of a qubit .",
    "it is also interesting and significant to study the geometric meaning of the bures fidelity for the case of a qu@xmath56it ( i.e. , an @xmath56-dimensional quantum object , @xmath57 corresponds to a qubit ) [ 10 ] , since the calculation becomes much more complicated , we shall investigate it elsewhere .",
    "nevertheless , we believe that a similar simple hyperbolic geometric relation , such as eq.([t16 ] ) , is possibly held for the case of a qu@xmath56it .",
