    "bistable systems are of frequent occurrence in physics @xcite , chemistry @xcite , biology @xcite , ecology @xcite , geophysics @xcite .",
    "stochastic bistable systems attract an interest because of a wide range of noise - induced phenomena in such systems : stochastic resonance @xcite , noise - induced chaos @xcite and synchronization @xcite , suppression of the chaotic dynamics by random perturbations @xcite .",
    "the noise - driven bistable systems can also exhibit noise - induced transitions whereby the stationary pdf changes its structural shape , e.g. number of extrema , when noise intensity varies @xcite .",
    "such transitions may occur both with multiplicative noise as in the original horsthemke - lefever scenario @xcite , and with additive noise ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "noise - induced transitions were observed in excitable systems ranging from a single excitable neuron @xcite to coupled excitable elements and media @xcite . in many cases noise - induced transitions are not true bifurcations @xcite , rather they underlie qualitative changes of the stochastic dynamics .",
    "noise - induced _ phase _ transitions were studied in spatially distributed systems perturbed by multiplicative noise @xcite and were shown to exist for the case of additive noise @xcite .",
    "a classical example of the stochastic bistable system is the kramers oscillator describing brownian motion in a double - well potential @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the drag coefficient , @xmath2 is the potential function , @xmath3 is gaussian white noise , and @xmath4 is the noise intensity . if @xmath1 is a constant parameter , then the noise - free system exhibits the simplest kind of the bistability : the coexistence of two stable fixed points in the phase space . in that case the two - dimensional stationary pdf of the stochastic system ( [ kramers ] ) possesses two maxima corresponding to potential wells , which are separated by a saddle point of the potential .",
    "position and number of peaks are invariant with respect to increase of the noise intensity , and a structure of the pdf does not depend on the noise intensity .",
    "the dynamics of the double - well potential systems like system ( [ kramers ] ) can be essentially different in the presence of dissipation depending nonlinearly on the system state .",
    "in particular , the bistable model offered in @xcite , which can be reduced to the eq . ( [ kramers ] ) with the nonlinear drag function @xmath5 and the double - well potential @xmath2 , demonstrates multiple noise - induced transitions and the non - monotonic dependence of the rice frequency on the noise intensity .    in this paper",
    "the oscillator proposed in @xcite is explored in the excitable regime and in the regime of the self - sustained oscillations .",
    "multiple noise - induced transitions due to additive noise are explained by the phase space structure of the deterministic system .",

    "[ fig2](b2 ) ) . further increasing the noise intensity results to destruction of the closed craters in sectors corresponding to the fast phase of the self - sustained oscillations",
    ". partial destruction of the closed crater in the pdf is typical for anharmonical self - sustained oscillators and is associated with the existence of so - called bifurcational interval at the hopf bifurcation @xcite .",

    "it happens because the phase point frequently reaches the vicinity of the saddle point in the origin from different areas of the phase space and then becomes slowed down . however , it is insufficient for final shaping of the central peak of the pdf in the origin . for larger values of the noise intensity",
