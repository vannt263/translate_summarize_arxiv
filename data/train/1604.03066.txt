    "occurrence of new class of materials , referred to as weyl semimetals ( wsm ) , was predicted theoretically @xcite and recently realized in experiments @xcite .",
    "the superconductivity of weyl semimetals ( wsm ) were also studied theoretically @xcite and experimentally @xcite . in the normal state wsms",
    "have , in general , a finite bulk conductance and hence they can be considered as metallic . at the same time , a semi - metal phase is realized when the fermi energy touches the weyl point where there is a contact between the filled valence and empty conduction bands .",
    "interestingly , the weyl points act as monopole source in momentum space for berry phase .",
    "semi - metallicity is unstable against doping that moves the fermi level into conduction or valence bands , thereby reaching the phase of weyl metal or even a ws . wsm host fermi arcs and require breaking time - reversal or inversion symmetries .",
    "weyl metals preserve the topological properties of fermi surface like fermi arcs .",
    "these arcs are terminated by projections of weyl points on the surface brillouin zone .",
    "the superconductivity of doped wsms supports crossed flat bands and not only simple arcs@xcite .    in this work",
    "we expose the physics of an n - ws junction between a normal metal ( n ) and a ws with uniform pairing state ( which is essential for the occurrence of crossed flat bands ) .",
    "the novel aspect here , of course , is encoded in the superconducting side of the junction , that is remarkably distinct from that of a usual superconductor .",
    "indeed , upon slight doping with finite chemical potential @xmath0 , a wsm has disconnected fermi surfaces , each of which surrounds a band - touching weyl points .",
    "( doping of wsm is easily achieved by modifying the chemical potential such that it is much larger than the gap of the ws , that is , @xmath1 . ) a special form of the order parameter can be realized on these fermi surfaces , corresponding either to bcs s - wave phase or to the fulde - ferrell- larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) phase . in the first case",
    ", the pairing occurs between states related by inversion symmetry(if it exists ) , while in the fflo phase the states of opposite sides of each fermi surface are paired .",
    "a constant s - wave pairing can support bulk gap nodes on the fermi surface @xcite ( nodal superconductor ) .    to elucidate the peculiar physics of the n - ws junction we write down the corresponding low energy hamiltonian , and then calculate the shot noise power of the junction and display it as a function of applied voltage .",
    "it was shown @xcite that depending on the orientation of the surface of the ws relative to tunneling direction the novel surface states can strongly affect conductance . here",
    "we consider the impact of these states on the shot noise power .",
    "technically , our approach uses the green s functions ( gfs ) of ws integrated over momentum .",
    "the method describes point junctions and is similar to the approach undertaken in paper @xcite .",
    "the gf depends crucially on the boundary conditions at the n - ws surface of contact , and therefore encodes the corresponding direction of the tunneling electrons .",
    "it is three cases are considered here : ( 1 - 2 ) n - ws junction with respective tunneling directions along the x ( n - wsx ) and z axes ( n - wsz ) , and 3 ) ( for comparison ) , n - s junction between normal metal and homogenous s - wave superconductor .",
    "the low energy hamiltonian for the n - ws junction reads @xmath2 , where the left lead ( n ) is biased by voltage @xmath3 and its hamiltonian reads @xmath4 .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian for the point contact is @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the junction tunneling constant . on the right side",

    "this is the basic element required for the derivation of the shot noise and electron transport along @xmath83 , where the topological nature of the ws is clearly exposed @xcite .",
    "the behavior of the conductance and the shot noise is determined by the structure of the flat band and the nature of the low energy states that occur for @xmath84 .",
    "we must obtain green function @xmath59 to find the spectrum and calculate the shot noise power .",

    "the panel b ) of fig.4 presents the fano factor , for the n - wsx junction ( with tunneling along the x- direction ) , while the tunneling current and the conductance for this case are , respectively , displayed on the a ) and b ) panels of fig.5 . at the smallest value of transmission parameter @xmath88",
    "there is a peak of conductance at @xmath89 which is similar to the zero bias conductance peak obtained in reference @xcite for nonzero control parameter @xmath30 . indeed a weak zero - bias conductance peak is maintained till @xmath90 ( not shown in the fig.5 ) .",
    "it is not completely clear why at @xmath91 a weak conductance peak is slightly shifted from @xmath92 .",
    "however , we note that the zero - bias conductance peak is a distinctive characteristic ( at least for @xmath93 ) of electron transport for tunneling in the x - the direction of n - wsx .",
    "there is no such an effect for ordinary n - s junction ( fig.3 b ) ) or for n - wsz junction with tunneling in z - direction ( fig.3 a ) ) .    as far as the shot noise ,",
    "fano factor are concerned , comparing our results for usual n - s and n - wsz junctions with n - wsx junctions we note a remarkable feature . unlike the cases with s - wave superconductor ( fig.1 b ) ) and n - wsz junction ( fig1 .",
    "a ) ) , the fano factor of n - wsx junction ( fig.4 b ) ) is strongly reduced at @xmath94 reaching zero value at @xmath92 .",
    "the shot noise power itself tends to zero even faster .",
    "thus the n - wsx junctions have unique properties encoded in the conductance and shot noise voltage dependence .",
    "therefore , the shot noise together with conductance can help to test experimentally the superconductivity in a doped weyl semi - metal .",
    "the effect has simple explanation : the flat band low energy spectrum @xcite which arises in n - wsx junction causes the occurrence of the peak in the density of states at zero energy ( in the gap region ) ( fig.4 panel a ) ) which is responsible for the zero - bias peak of conductance and strong reducing of the shot noise at @xmath95 .",
    "here we would like to compare our system with n - mbs junction @xcite , where mbs stand for topological superconductor with majorana zero bound state at his end . in both systems",
    "there is zero energy bound state ( in the gap region ) .",
    "we expect behavior of the shot noise similar to our system .",
    "indeed , the formula for the total shot noise power in the case of majorana zero bound state @xcite is given by equation @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the tunneling width .",
    "thus we see that as the bias voltage @xmath95 _ both the noise power and its first derivative _ vanish : @xmath98 . i. e. the transport is coherent",
    ". moreover , it is found that the conductance has zero bias peak .",
    "in this work we suggest that measurements of shot noise and fano factor serve as an additional benchmark for studying the topological properties of weyl superconductors and the superconductivity of a doped weyl semi - metal .",
    "the superconductivity itself can support crossed surface flat bands @xcite .",
    "the specific topology of wsm is presented by point nodes in the s - wave pairing state . for the model described by the hamiltonian ( 1 ) ,",
    "different tunneling directions are not equivalent : for z direction tunneling , the boundary does not creates in - gap states , whereas for transport along the x axis the flat bands define the low energy spectrum of weyl superconductor .",
    "these low energy bands cause the finite density of states in the middle of the superconducting gap .",
    "the high density of states in the gap strongly influences the transport and the shot noise power .",
    "the fano factor tends to zero at @xmath95-the effect that can be tested on experiment .    in closing",
    "we remark on the approximations that were made here .",
    "first , the parameter @xmath30 which controls the positions and number of the weyl points is not employed in our calculations while it was considered for complete two - band model ( 3 ) in reference @xcite",
    ". however , based on the approximate quasiclassical hamiltonian ( 1 ) , the nontrivial topology related to the surface of ws orthogonal to the x - axis clearly reveals itself via zero bias peak of the conductance and the vanishing at @xmath95 of both the shot noise power and the fano factor .",
    "second , we used an approach that describes the electron tunneling in the same way as for a point junction . the right electrode is a superconductor which is characterized by its gfs properly integrated over momenta . however , while for a z- directed transport the inhomogeneity along the z - axis is irrelevant and may be ignored in deriving the shot noise , for x - tunneling direction the inhomogeneity along the x - axis ( due to the superconductor s surface ) is relevant . in the latter case",
    "we have solved the boundary problem and found an approximate expression for the gf .",

    "<S> we demonstrate that current - current correlations ( in particular the shot noise ) , can be used to study the intrinsic superconductivity in a slightly doped weyl semi - metal . </S>",
    "<S> the systems studied is an n - ws tunneling junction where the left electrode is a normal metal while the right electrode is a weyl superconductor ( ws ) . </S>",
    "<S> the superconductivity supports surface state with crossed flat bands thereby impact the low energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this spectrum displays a modified density of states in the gap region that strongly affects transport characteristics of the n - ws junction . </S>",
    "<S> the fano factor is calculated as function of the applied bias , and shown to be dependent essentially on the orientation of the surface of ws relative to the tunneling direction . </S>",
    "<S> if this orientation supports the occurrence of low energy state , then the shot noise power decreases with decreasing voltage , a property similar to that prevailing in a junction with majorana bound state . </S>"
