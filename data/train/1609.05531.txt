    "in this paper we consider the dynamics of a small spherical particle driven through an unbounded viscoelastic shear flow by an external force . in a newtonian fluid the terminal velocity of the particle",
    "is determined by the balance between the stokes drag and the external force , and it is unaffected by the shear flow . but in a viscoelastic fluid the flow around the particle creates tension in the fluid .",
    "this tension exerts a force directly on the particle surface , but it also modifies the flow to induce an additional viscous force on the particle .",
    "the shear flow changes the tension in the fluid , and thereby modifies the terminal velocity of the particle , in contrast to the newtonian case .",
    "a viscoelastic shear flow reduces the terminal velocity of a sphere when the applied shear flow is perpendicular to gravity @xcite .",
    "this so - called cross - shear flow is a model system for transport of particles in vertical cracks induced by hydraulic fracturing @xcite .",
    "experiments by @xcite first demonstrated that a cross - shear flow strongly reduces the settling velocity , and that fluid elasticity is the dominant mechanism .",
    "recently , numerical simulations by @xcite verified an increased drag on a sphere translating through a cross - shear flow , and showed that the experimental observation is explained by a combination of viscoelasticity and the effects of the nearby walls in the experiment . calculations by @xcite demonstrate that the drag is increased also in an unbounded viscoelastic cross - shear flow .",
    "these studies concern settling in a cross - shear flow in which the gravity acts along the vorticity axis . in this case",
    "the physical system is invariant under a 180@xmath3 rotation around the vorticity axis .",
    "this symmetry was exploited in both the analytical and numerical calculations to reduce the number of variables @xcite .",
    "in particular the only relevant force is the drag force , and the particle only rotates around the vorticity axis .",
    "the effect of the shear on settling is substantial in this symmetrical case , and this fact raises new questions : how are the dynamics affected when gravity acts at an angle to the vorticity ?",
    "are there additional forces and torques when the symmetry is broken ?",
    "how does the drag change as the angle between gravity and flow vorticity changes ?    in this paper",
    "we calculate the effect of an unbounded shear flow on the terminal particle velocity for any orientation of the external force relative to the shear .",
    "we must consequently abandon the simplifications of the symmetrical case .",
    "we must allow for lift forces in the flow - shear plane , as well as rotation around any axis .",
    "further , because viscoelasticity is a non - linear effect it is not possible to construct the general result as a linear combination of results for two independent directions .",
    "therefore we must solve the general perturbation problem for the flow velocity @xmath4 and viscoelastic stress tensor @xmath5 around a translating and rotating particle in a shear flow .",
    "our calculation relies on a perturbation theory for weak elasticity , valid to second order in the deborah and weissenberg numbers .",
    "these dimensionless numbers measure the elastic relaxation time of the fluid relative to the rate of translation and the shear rate .",
    "we solve the problem on tensorial form .",
    "our solution does not refer to any coordinate representation such as spherical coordinates .",
    "since the governing equations and boundary conditions are tensorial in nature , this simplifies the calculations .",
    "all steps of the calculation are algebraic , and therefore well suited to computer implementation . to achieve this we introduce a new basis set of symmetric , rank-@xmath6 cartesian tensors .",
    "we describe these tensors and how to calculate with them in some detail in section  [ sec : ttensors ] , because we expect that they will be useful for treating other problems too .",
    "we present two related calculations .",
    "the first is the mobility problem , where we impose an external force @xmath7 on the particle , and compute the resulting particle velocity @xmath8 .",
    "this corresponds directly to the experimental protocol of for example @xcite , where they release a sphere in a cylindrical couette device and measure the steady settling velocity .",
    "the other question is the resistance problem , where we prescribe the particle velocity @xmath9 , and compute the resulting force @xmath10 exerted by the fluid on the particle .",
    "this approach corresponds to the calculations by @xcite and numerical simulations by @xcite .",
    "the two are related , because given the solution to the mobility problem @xmath8 , and the solution of the resistance problem @xmath10 , it must hold that @xmath11 . in this paper",
    "we solve both the mobility problem and the resistance problem for a freely rotating spherical particle in an unbounded viscoelastic shear flow , with no restriction on the direction of @xmath9 or @xmath7 relative to the shear .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : problem ] we describe the problem , give the governing equations , and describe how we apply the lorenz reciprocal theorem . in section  [ sec : ttensors ] we explain our algebraic solution of the inhomogeneous stokes equation in terms of cartesian tensors , and summarise their algebraic properties .",
    "we summarise our calculation and give the final result in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we discuss the results and conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "[ sec : problem ]      we consider the steady - state motion of a spherical particle of radius @xmath12 , suspended in a viscoelastic fluid and subject to an external force @xmath7 . for concreteness we may think of the gravitational force @xmath13 .",
    "the particle moves with center - of - mass velocity @xmath9 , and rotates with angular velocity @xmath14 .",
    "far away from the particle the flow is a simple shear flow @xmath15 . in a simple shear flow the vorticity and strain",

    "there are two dimensionless parameters that govern this problem , corresponding to the translational and rotational motion of the particle compared to the relaxation time @xmath18 of the viscoelastic fluid .",
    "the deborah number @xmath19 is associated with the time scale of convective flow over the particle size . in the resistance problem , @xmath20 is simply the magnitude @xmath21 of the imposed velocity @xmath9 . in the mobility problem",
    "we estimate the characteristic speed by @xmath22 , related to the terminal velocity in stokes flow under an external force of magnitude @xmath23 . here",

    "the ratio @xmath28 measures the relative importance of the imposed shear to the translational motion .",
    "the perturbation theory in this paper is valid in the limit @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "this implies that the elastic part of the fluid relaxes quickly relative to the rate at which it is deformed by the moving particle and the shear flow . in the following",
    "we expand in @xmath31 , and treat the ratio @xmath32 as an @xmath33-quantity .",
    "but in the end we give the result in terms of @xmath31 and @xmath34 .",
    "we neglect the effects of fluid inertia .",
    "this requires that the viscous relaxation time of the fluid is shorter than the elastic relaxation time @xmath18 , so that we can neglect effects of inertio - elastic coupling .",

    "( [ eqn : rt_trans ] ) because @xmath79 however , we evaluate the two integral contributions in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : rt_trans ] ) separately , because they give the contributions from two different physical mechanisms . the surface integral represents the extra polymer stress acting directly on the particle surface ( see eq .",
    "( [ eqn : v2polymer ] ) and ( [ eqn : f2polymer ] ) in section  [ sec : results ] ) .",
    "the volume integral represents the indirect effect that the polymer stress modifies the flow field , which in turn modifies the viscous stress on the particle .",
    "[ sec : ttensors ] in this section we introduce a basis set of symmetric rank-@xmath6 cartesian tensors @xmath80 .",
    "each of these basis tensors is a linear combination of spherical harmonics @xmath81 with a particular value of the angular momentum quantum number @xmath82 , and therefore the cartesian tensors share many useful properties with the spherical harmonics .",
    "for example , surface integrals vanish unless @xmath83 , tensors with different values of @xmath82 are orthogonal with respect to integration over the unit sphere , and they have known fourier transforms .    because of their direct relation the spherical harmonics , the @xmath84-tensors are an alternative basis for lamb s general solution for stokes flow @xcite . but as explained in detail below , a rank-@xmath6 @xmath84-tensor is also closely related to the rank-@xmath6 polyad @xmath85 of a unit vector @xmath86 . together with the radial functions @xmath87 these polyads are the building blocks of the familiar multipole expansion for stokes flow , for example the stokeslet @xmath88 , or the rotlet @xmath89 .",
    "therefore the @xmath84-tensors stand as a new alternative between lamb s general solution in spherical coordinates , and the cartesian multipole expansion .",
    "although any calculation may in principle be performed in any of these representations , we found that the basis described here is suitable for implementation in computer algebra .",
    "in particular it enables us to write down particular solutions to inhomogenous stokes equations on tensorial form , without any explicit coordinate representation , and without explicitly solving differential equations .    in this section",
    "we use index notation to avoid any ambiguity . when appropriate we use the vector notation @xmath90 , remembering that @xmath90 is rank @xmath6 and symmetric in all indices .",

    "settling in inclined shear flow . _ to make this discussion more concrete we now consider a particle settling under gravity , @xmath232 , through an inclined shear flow .",
    "we take the inclination to be in the flow direction , so that gravity lies in the plane spanned by the vorticity axis and the flow direction , see fig .",

    "the figure shows a center cross - section of the particle , viewed along the direction of external forcing . in the cross - shear flow , @xmath222 ,",
    "the stretching is a complicated function of the spatial variables , but perfectly symmetric around the sphere ( top row in fig .",
    "[ fig : stress_tilty ] ) .",
    "therefore there is no net force on the particle .",
    "but as the external forcing is tilted to the flow direction , the particle is pushed along the flow direction so that its surface moves along the undisturbed flow on one side and opposed to the undisturbed flow on the other .",
    "this asymmetry results in different stretching of the dumbbells on the two sides , as illustrated for @xmath237 in the second row of fig .",

    "this stress contributes to the particle drift both directly , by forcing the particle surface , and indirectly by forcing the suspending fluid and thereby inducing additional viscous drag .",
    "_ in this paper we also introduced the tensors @xmath80 ( section  [ sec : ttensors ] ) .",
    "these tensors are a basis suitable for symbolic calculations of tensorial quantities in spherical geometry .",
    "in particular they allow us to write down solutions to inhomogenous stokes equations on tensorial form , without any explicit coordinate representation , and without explicitly solving differential equations .",

    "our tensor formalism can also be extended to other geometries .",
