    "<S> we use angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) to explore the electronic structure of single crystals of fese over a wide range of binding energies and study the effects of strong electron - electron correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we provide evidence for the existence of  hubbard - like bands \" at high binding energies consisting of incoherent many - body excitations originating from fe @xmath0 states in addition to the renormalized quasiparticle bands near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> many high energy features of the observed arpes data can be accounted for when incorporating effects of strong local coulomb interactions in calculations of the spectral function via dynamical mean - field theory , including the formation of a hubbard - like band . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that over the energy scale of several ev , local correlations arising from the on - site coulomb repulsion and hund s coupling are essential for a proper understanding of the electronic structure of fese and other related iron based superconductors .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction.- _ understanding the role of electron - electron correlations in materials exhibiting high-@xmath1 unconventional superconductivity is one of the central problems within the field of strongly correlated electron systems . unlike the cuprates , the parent compounds of the fe - based superconductors ( e.g. lafeaso ) are not mott insulators but antiferromagnetic metals at low temperatures , away from half - filling </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , local electron - electron interactions on the fe site do play an important role , although in this case it has been shown that it is the hund s coupling @xmath2 rather than the coulomb repulsion @xmath3 which is most important both for the magnetic ordering @xcite and for the degree of band renormalization @xcite . from an experimental point of view , </S>",
    "<S> clear manifestations of the effect of strong correlations in fe - based superconductors are found in enhancements of quasiparticle effective masses deduced from specific heat @xcite and quantum oscillations measurements @xcite , and from band renormalisations observed in angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these measurements indicate that the low - energy electronic structure broadly resembles that predicted by density functional theory ( dft ) calculations , at least , at temperatures above any magnetic or orbital orderings , but with the experimental band dispersions being renormalised by a factor typically of @xmath43 @xcite , although this varies substantially between systems , and is orbital - dependent @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , while general considerations of many - body theory would suggest that this band renormalisation must be accompanied by the transfer of spectral weight into incoherent excitations at higher binding energies @xcite , the high energy spectral weight has only rarely been experimentally investigated in fe - based superconductors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> fese provides an ideal case to study the effect of strong correlations in fe - based superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> the recent availability of high - quality single crystals @xcite and thin films @xcite of fese has led to a surge of experimental work , including recent arpes studies with a focus on the origin of the nematic phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> arpes @xcite , quantum oscillations @xcite and specific heat measurements of fese @xcite have previously reported significant orbital - dependent effective mass renormalisations . </S>",
    "<S> theoretically , a significant effect of correlations in fese has been found in combined density functional theory with dynamical mean field theory ( dft+dmft ) calculations @xcite , in which local coulomb repulsion @xmath3 and hund s coupling @xmath2 on the fe site are accounted for .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we present systematic arpes studies of the spectral function of fese to high binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the renormalised quasiparticle bands near the fermi level , we find much broader features lying in a range of 1 - 2.5  ev binding energy , well separated from the quasiparticle structure and the se 4p bands at @xmath43 - 6  ev . a  </S>",
    "<S> peak - dip - hump \" structure on such an energy scale is usually a trademark of strong electron - electron interactions , which reduce the spectral weight of the quasiparticle peak and give rise to hubbard bands at higher and lower binding energies  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our dft+dmft calculations are able to reproduce many of the qualitative features of the experimental electronic structure at high binding energies , including the formation of hubbard - like bands of incoherent spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> while accounting for local electron - electron interactions within dft+dmft alone is not sufficient for a perfect description of the experimental fermi surface , we show that the strong interactions are responsible for the overall form of the spectral function of fese over an energy scale of several ev .    _ </S>",
    "<S> methods.- _ single crystals of fese were grown by the vapor - transport method @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> arpes measurements were performed at the i05 beamline at diamond light source at temperatures below 10  k. arpes measurements are a probe of the one - particle spectral function @xmath5 @xcite , multiplied by the fermi occupation function and the matrix elements for photo - emission @xcite , with some additional background . </S>",
    "<S> this spectral function is commonly expressed as :    @xmath6 ^ 2 + [ \\sigma''(\\omega{},\\mathbf{k})]^2}\\ ] ]    where @xmath7 is the bare non - interacting dispersion , @xmath8 the chemical potential and @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the real and imaginary parts of the self - energy , which in general is orbital- , frequency- and momentum - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> in many materials where electronic correlations are weak and do not play a significant role , @xmath11 is small and sharp dispersions can be observed in arpes measurements to binding energies of several ev , usually in good agreement with the dft dispersions . on the other hand , in fese , electron - electron interactions on the fe @xmath0 site do give a significant contribution to the self - energy  @xcite , while the system remains metallic . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the observed dispersions close to the fermi level at low temperatures can be interpreted as coherent quasiparticles with renormalised dispersions @xmath12 , and a scattering rate @xmath10 that introduces a finite lifetime for quasiparticle excitations . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the form of @xmath13 there may be apparent  kinks \" or  waterfalls \" @xcite in the spectral function where the observed states transform from the renormalized quasiparticle peak close to the fermi level into incoherent excitations at higher or lower binding energies . </S>",
    "<S> generally speaking , at higher binding energy , features can become very broad and incoherent when @xmath10 becomes large , and in particular the formation of hubbard - like bands is possible @xcite . while experimental evidence of hubbard bands has been largely reported for effective one - band systems  @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> results for multiorbital systems are scarce with only a few well - studied exceptions like transition metal oxides  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the dft+dmft calculations were performed within the local density approximation in dft and using the full - potential linear augmented plane - wave ( flapw ) basis within the wien2k  @xcite package . </S>",
    "<S> calculations were done for the orthorhombic crystal structure  @xcite , and differences in the calculation to the tetragonal crystal structures were small ( supplemental material , sm for further experimental data and details of dmft calculations performed with different interaction parameters . ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we used the projection method onto a local basis as described in refs .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with a window encompassing both the iron @xmath0 and selenium @xmath14 states . </S>",
    "<S> the impurity problem for the fe @xmath0 orbitals was solved with the strong - coupling continuous - time quantum monte - carlo method  @xcite using the alps package  @xcite . as interaction parameters we use the established values of @xmath3=4 ev , @xmath2=0.8  ev  @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1 ] we present high - symmetry arpes measurements for fese in the m-@xmath19-m direction , using linear vertical ( lv ) polarisation . in this geometry , </S>",
    "<S> strong matrix elements effects dictate that the spectral weight arises overwhelmingly from a single hole - like band with @xmath18 character @xcite , which simplifies the observation . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1]a ) focuses on the dispersion of this @xmath18 hole band close to @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle band dispersions undergo @xmath420 mev band shifts in the nematic phase @xcite , but these are very small perturbations on the energy scales of a few ev as considered in this paper . </S>",
    "<S> due to spin - orbit coupling there is a small mixing of spectral weight onto the outer ( @xmath21 ) hole band near the fermi level @xcite . in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b ) , c ) , d ) we present measurements extending to binding energies of 7 ev at a selection of incident photon energies . varying the photon energy has multiple effects . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , the @xmath22 of the slice of the brillouin zone probed varies ( e.g. 37 ev and 56 ev are near @xmath19 and z points respectively @xcite ) which can affect the position and orbital character of bands . </S>",
    "<S> secondly arpes matrix elements themselves have a complex photon - energy dependence . </S>",
    "<S> finally , if the photon energy passes through an fe or se resonance this may affect the relative intensity of fe or se contributions to the photoemission ( this gives an enhancement of the se bands in the 56 ev spectra in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c ) ) . we do not attempt to disentangle all these effects which lead to the differences between spectra presented in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] b - d ) , but rather point out five common features which are observed at all photon energies , as we have represented schematically in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]e , f ) ; ( i ) near the fermi level the observed band is both shifted and renormalised with respect to dft calculations , as has been widely reported in fe - based superconductors @xcite , although the much smaller than expected fermi surfaces in fese is a unique feature . </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) the quasiparticle band dispersions become much sharper towards the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) there is generally a dip in intensity in the range @xmath40.5 - 1 ev in experiments , where neither quasiparticles nor incoherent excitations are found . </S>",
    "<S> ( iv ) traces of the se @xmath14 bands are detected in the range 3 - 6 ev binding energy , as predicted by dft . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the se @xmath14 bands do not experience any significant renormalisation </S>",
    "<S> . finally , ( v ) in the range of @xmath41 - 2.5 ev we observe an anomalous broad band of intensity which can not be attributed to either a fe-@xmath0 quasiparticle band or a se @xmath14 band . </S>",
    "<S> the width of this spectral feature is of the order of @xmath41  ev which indicates that these excitations are very short lived . </S>",
    "<S> we interpret this as a  hubbard - like band \" , consisting of incoherent spectral weight that is a precursor of the localized electron - removal states , the lower hubbard band , in mott - hubbard - insulating systems . </S>",
    "<S> no significant temperature - dependence was found in the high energy features up to 150  k ( sm ) . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] we present a selection of arpes spectra obtained in different measurement conditions , which indicate that this incoherent spectral weight in the region around @xmath41 - 2.5  ev is a general feature of fese , and not specific to a particular band or geometry . </S>",
    "<S> next to each experimental measurement , we also show how the high energy features of fese seen by arpes can be qualitatively reproduced by calculations of the spectral function in dft+dmft . in order to perform a comparison to arpes data , </S>",
    "<S> simple selection rules are employed to simulate the photoemission matrix elements in that geometry . </S>",
    "<S> they are based on both symmetry considerations and the identified orbital character of the primary quasiparticle bands in the cut @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as presented in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a ) dft+dmft reproduces the observed renormalised quasiparticle @xmath18 band and some additional high energy spectral weight around 1 - 2.5 ev . </S>",
    "<S> however , the agreement is not perfect , and the renormalisation of the effective masses in dft+dmft ( e.g. @xmath23  2.09 for @xmath24 , sm ) is less than the experiments ( @xmath42 - 4 for @xmath24 bands , @xcite ) , which is to be expected due to the neglect of spin - flip and pair - hopping terms  @xcite and dynamical screening effects  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still , we expect that any hubbard band - like features are not qualitatively affected by these approximations , since their binding energy is governed by the low - energy static values of the interaction , which are accounted for in the calculation . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]b ) the dft+dmft calculation shows a broad band of incoherent @xmath25 spectral weight in good correspondence with anomalous weight found in arpes around 1.5 - 2.5 ev . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d ) , dft+dmft finds some incoherent spectral weight in the @xmath26 orbital around the m point , similar to the arpes data . finally in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]e ) the @xmath25 weight through the m point is reproduced very well , showing a clear formation of a hubbard - like band . </S>",
    "<S> overall there is a qualitative good agreement between calculations and experiment , as the dft+dmft technique correctly captures both the renormalised quasiparticle bands which sharpen approaching the fermi level , along with the incoherent spectral weight around 1 - 2.5 ev .    </S>",

    "<S> [ fig3]a ) we compare the integrated spectral weight from our dft+dmft calculation with the result from dft . </S>",
    "<S> notably the fe @xmath0 bandwidth develops a peak - dip - hump structure which is not present in the dft ; this arises from the separation of the quasi - particle bands and the hubbard satellite peak around 2 ev . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , the dmft treatment does not strongly affect the se @xmath14 bands . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]c ) we show the different orbital contributions to the total spectral weight . </S>",
    "<S> the hubbard band feature appears most clearly in the @xmath25 and @xmath24 orbitals but can be identified in all , similar to ref .  </S>",

    "<S> similar qualitative features are found , with good agreement on the position of the hubbard - like peak , which supports the chosen values of the interaction parameters @xmath28 , which are also close to values recently determined from first - principles calculations @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we note that in dft+dmft the hubbard - like peak shifts to higher binding energies with increasing @xmath28 , where the hund s coupling @xmath2 has a stronger effect on the energy of the hubbard band than @xmath3 ( sm ) .    finally in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d , e ) we compare the experimental fermi surfaces of fese at 100 k with the calculated ones . </S>",
    "<S> the measured fermi surfaces are significantly shrunk compared to the prediction of dft+dmft . in order to match the experimental dispersions </S>",
    "<S> , the real parts of the self - energies would need to be significantly momentum - dependent in order to introduce a downward - shift for hole bands at the gamma point and an upward - shift for the electron bands at the m point  @xcite . in dmft , </S>",
    "<S> the considered interactions ( @xmath28 ) are purely local and the self - energies @xmath29 are independent of @xmath30 , albeit orbital - dependent , so that momentum - dependent shifts of the dft bandstructure can only result from the momentum - dependent orbital characters of the bands </S>",
    "<S> . the limitations of dft+dmft at the fermi level indicate that effects not included in the calculations such as non - local inter - site interactions @xcite , coupling to bosonic modes @xcite or frustrated magnetism @xcite are likely to be relevant to the low - energy physics . however , for the wide energy scales considered in this paper our dft+dmft calculation is able to satisfactorily capture many of the high energy features of our arpes spectra , including the presence of incoherent spectral weight in the form of hubbard - like bands at high binding energies , with specific orbital - dependent agreements . </S>",
    "<S> our experiments and calculations place bulk fese as a significantly correlated metal , with coherent quasiparticles at the fermi level , but also exhibiting incoherent spectral weight at high binding energies , consistent with earlier photoemission studies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusion.- _ to summarise , we have provided systematic experimental evidence , backed up by theoretical dft+dmft calculations , for the emergence of a fe @xmath0 hubbard - like band in the spectral function of fese , distinct from the quasiparticle states near the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> this high - energy feature is interpreted as a fingerprint of the effect of strong electron - electron correlations . despite the strong renormalisation and shift of spectral weight into the hubbard - like features , a well - defined quasiparticle peak at the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> is retained . </S>",
    "<S> therefore fese provides a rare opportunity to study hubbard - band physics in a significantly correlated , metallic , multiorbital system . </S>",
    "<S> the unique properties of fese continue to provide theoretical challenges , but we have demonstrated that the dft+dmft technique captures the essential features of the high - energy spectral function well , highlighting the importance of local coulomb interactions and hund s coupling for both low and high energy features in fe - based superconductors . </S>"
