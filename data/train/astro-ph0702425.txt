    "a large proportion ( at least 39% ) of wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars in the solar neighborhood have been observationally confirmed to lie in binary systems ( van der hucht 2001 ) .",
    "these stars have dense , highly - supersonic , radiatively - driven winds that , upon colliding with the wind from a companion , produce strong shocks that compress and heat the gas to temperatures high enough to produce substantial x - ray flux .",
    "these colliding wind binaries ( cwbs ) , which can contain a pair of wr stars , a wr star with an ob supergiant companion , or a pair of ob stars , were first proposed by prilutskii & usov ( 1976 ) and cherepashchuk ( 1976 ) .",
    "this x - ray excess has since been observationally confirmed ( pollock 1987 ) .    for more than a decade",
    ", the hydrodynamics of cwbs have been investigated using two - dimensional ( axisymmertric ) hydrodynamical simulations ( e.g. luo , mccray , & mac low 1990 ; stevens , blondin , & pollock 1992 ) in order to compute synthetic x - ray spectra for comparison to observations .",
    "a variety of physical effects that are important for the dynamics of the winds have been identified , including radiative inhibition ( stevens & pollock 1994 ) and sudden radiative braking ( gayley , owocki , & cranmer 1997 ) .",
    "the former is the effect of the radiation field of one star decreasing the radiative acceleration of the wind from the other , while the latter is where the radiation field of one star is intense enough to actually cause a net deceleration of the other star s wind .",
    "while including such effects leads to more realistic models of cwbs ( e.g. henley , stevens , & pittard 2005 ) , most current simulations are typically still done in only two - dimensions , assuming axisymmetry around the line joining the two stars .",
    "this requires neglecting the coriolis force resulting from orbital motion . including the coriolis force requires fully three - dimensional hydrodynamical models which , up to now , have been largely untractable .    in this paper , we investigate the effect of orbital motion on the hydrodynamic and observable properties of the wind collision region by performing fully three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of cwbs .",
    "we conduct a parameter survey in orbital velocity for stars on circular orbits , and also present models for stars on elliptical orbits and with unequal strength winds .",
    "our focus in this paper is the three - dimensional dynamics of the wind collision region , thus to simplify the problem we neglect a number of physical processes that can be important in real systems , but would serve to complicate the interpretation of our results .",
    "in particular , we neglect radiative cooling of the postshock gas and do not try to model the radiative driving of the winds . instead of explicitly including gravity in our simulations , we assume that gravitational deceleration balances radiative acceleration in the unshocked winds and give the winds a constant velocity profile .",
    "this velocity is chosen to be the unshocked wind velocity given by a beta velocity law at the distance of the stagnation point ( see eq . [ [ eq : beta ] ] for more details ) .",
    "we discuss in  [ sec : conclusion ] possible implications of neglecting gravitational force on the unshocked wind of the companion star as well as the post - shock gas",
    ". since we do not model radiative effects , there will be no sudden radiative braking or radiative inhibition in our simulations .",
    "sudden radiative braking is thought to occur only with strongly unequal winds ( gayley et al .",
    "1997 ) , which we will not consider here .",
    "while for most early - type binaries it is important to consider radiative cooling of the postshock gas by line emission , we leave this to future research .",
    "we have chosen a sample system that could be composed of a pair of o - stars , which we find is neither purely adiabatic nor strongly radiative ( see  [ sec : systems ] ) using the appropriate formula in antokhin , owocki , & brown ( 2004 ) .",
    "we will comment on how including more realistic radiative effects on the winds might change our results .",
    "it is important to note ours are not the first fully three - dimensional simulations of cwbs ; walder ( 1998 ) showed that orbital motion can produce archimedian spirals similar to those visible in infrared images of wr 98a ( monnier , tuthill , & danchi 1999 ) and wr 104 ( tuthill , monnier , & danchi 1999 ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : numerical ] we describe the details of our simulations and the diagnostics we use to interpret our results . in  [ sec : results ] we present analysis of the post - shock temperatures , emissivity , column density , and instabilities that result for colliding winds from identical stars on circular orbits , with a range of values for the ratio of wind velocity to orbital velocity .",
    "we also consider systems with eccentric orbits and unequal winds . finally , in ",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we discuss the implications by applying our results to wr 20a .",
    "we present three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations conducted on a cartesian grid with the athena code ( gardiner & stone 2005 , 2006 ) .",

    "we use the roe riemann solver augmented with the h - correction of sanders , morano & druguet ( 1998 ) to prevent the carbuncle phenomenon ( quirk 1994 ) .",
    "we use outflow boundary conditions and run our simulations for up to three orbital periods .",
    "most of our simulations were run on @xmath12 grids with boxes of length @xmath13 ( where the seperation between the stars is @xmath14 ) , however we also ran three simulations on @xmath0 grids , two of them with @xmath15 and the third with @xmath16 .",

    "we evolve the system for much longer than a wind - crossing time to make sure the ambient medium has been completely driven off the grid before starting our analysis .",
    "see the appendix for the details of how we generate our wind .      to investigate the effect of orbital motion on both the hydrodynamic and observable properties of the collision region , we take a binary system with a circular orbit and vary the ratio of the wind velocity to orbital velocity .",
    "the mass of the stars and the orbital period are varied so as to keep the semi - major axis of the orbit constant while varying the orbital velocity .",

    "despite neglecting radiative effects in our simulations , we feel there is still something to be learned from studying this hypothetical set of systems .",

    "for example , the power emitted from gas with @xmath92 varies by @xmath93 as a large roll is advected off the grid in the small - box simulation @xmath59 .",
    "the instability is seeded by grid noise associated with the representation of thin shocks on the cartesian grid ( the stair - stepping observed in figure [ fig : kh - temper ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of the grid noise is correlated with the phase of the orbit ( direction of the shock with respect to the grid ) , therefore we see periodicity in the k - h rolls at one - quarter of an orbit .",
    "although the k - h rolls in our calculations are seeded by grid noise , the effect is real , and could be seeded by variability or clumpiness in the winds .",
    "the stair - stepping also introduces grid noise into the volume occuppied by gas at various temperatures . for this reason",
    ", we try to compare the results for rapidly orbiting stars to model c10 rather than model s as much as possible in our parameter survey , since in c10 the motion of the shocks over the grid averages out the grid noise , yet the orbital motion is small enough to not significantly affect the structure compared to the stationary case s.    the power emitted by free - free emission from gas with @xmath94 is @xmath95 for @xmath61 .",

    "the high - temperature tail of the distribution extends beyond this predicted maximum , likely due to multi - dimensional effects not taken into account in our estimate . to prevent our results from having a dependence on orbital phase due solely to the cubical shape of the computational domain , we choose to consider in our analysis only cells with post - shock temperatures @xmath94 for the large - box runs and @xmath101 ( marked with the short dashed vertical line in figure [ fig : highd - temp ] ) for the small - box runs .",

    "when a smaller box is used , the column density to the center of mass changes most near the minima .",
    "the post - shock gas that was near the edge of the box in the large - box runs is not visible in the small - box runs . even though the values change , the qualitative features remain .",
    "the column density to the primary and secondary when the orbit is circular and the winds are identical is essentially the same but with a phase shift of 0.5 .",
    "it is highest near when the stars are on the far side of the center of mass relative to the observer , near phase 0.0 for the primary and 0.5 for the secondary .",
    "when the stars are equally distant from the observer , the column density is higher to the star that is moving toward the observer , the primary at phase 0.25 and the secondary at phase 0.75 , because the post - shock material leads the star .",
    "when a smaller box is used , the column density to the stars is affected at all phases . instead of continuously decreasing after one peak until the next peak is approached , in a small box the column density flattens out well before the next peak .",

    "the maximum for @xmath62 is only @xmath128 higher than the mean and the minimum is only @xmath129 lower . the curve for @xmath62 is symmetrical in time while that for @xmath63 is not .",
    "we will discuss the reason for this below .    while the stellar separation is the same at phase @xmath130 as at phase @xmath131 , the stellar radial velocities differ in sign , so we do not expect the post - shock temperature distribution to be symmetrical in time .",
    "we instead find that , while the velocity of the stars towards each other is increasing , the high - temperature tail of the distribution drops off more steeply than for a circular orbit and , conversely , when the stellar radial velocity is increasing , the high - temperature tail drops off less steeply .",
    "the sign of the change in volume at a given temperature switches first for low temperatures and later for higher temperatures .",
    "while the total volume with @xmath124 , shown in figure [ fig : volecc ] , in @xmath62 is correlated with the separation between the stars , with more volume for larger separations , in @xmath63 it is correlated with the stellar radial velocity , with the most volume when the stars are moving towards each other with the highest velocities . at apastron",
    "the shock thickness along the line of centers is approximately @xmath132 larger than for the circular - orbit case and at periastron it is approximately @xmath132 smaller .",
    "the phase delay for the gas leaving the mask to reach the shock in @xmath62 is typically between 0.02 and 0.04 .",
    "although the maximum and minimum post - shock temperatures do not occur near periastron and apastron , respectively , in our simulation , the maximum and minimum peak power / volume due to free - free emission do .",
    "the maximum peak power / volume in @xmath63 matches that in @xmath61 near phases 0.27 and 0.71 . at phase 0.27 ,",
    "the power / volume distribution is similar for @xmath61 and @xmath63 except at low values , where there is more volume from @xmath133 gas for @xmath63 . at phase 0.71 , the power / volume distribution is again similar except at low values , where there is now less volume from @xmath124 gas for @xmath63 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : colecc ] , we compare the column density as a function of phase for @xmath61 and @xmath63 .",
    "the projection of the line of sight onto the orbital plane runs parallel to the semi - major axis of the elliptical orbit . when the orbit is circular , the two peaks in column density when looking toward the center of mass of the system are identical , but when the orbit is elliptical , the peak before periastron is higher and the peak after is lower .",
    "the minimum before periastron is lower and the minimum after is higher .",
    "the difference between the peak and minimum column density is @xmath134 higher for the elliptical orbit than for the circular orbit .",
    "since the separation between the stars is no longer the same half an orbit apart , the column density to the primary and secondary no longer share the same phase - shifted time dependence even though the individual winds are still identical .",
    "the column density to the primary is now lower at all phases than it was in the circular - orbit case , while the column density to the secondary is higher for most , but not all , phases . where the column density to the primary is nearly flat under a circular orbit",
    ", it now varies with time due to the changing stellar separation .",
    "the secondary has a narrower peak near periastron and is nt quite as flat after apastron .",
    "the difference between the minimum and peak column densities is @xmath135 higher for the elliptical orbit than for the circular orbit .",
    "when we consider stars with differing wind parameters on circular orbits , we find that the thickness of the post - shock region along the line of centers does not change .",
    "the post - shock region is shifted toward the secondary , though , giving a distance ratio from the star centers to the center of the post - shock region of 1.2 for @xmath65 and 1.3 for @xmath67 .",
    "we expect that modifying the wind velocity will change the temperature distribution , but that modifying the mass - loss rate will not .",
    "this follows from the equation for energy per unit mass , @xmath136 since @xmath137 , this implies that @xmath138 .",
    "the wind density is set by both the mass - loss rate and wind velocity , however , so we expect that modifying either one will cause a change in the emissivities .",
    "we histogram the volume in bins of width @xmath139 in post - shock temperature using a temperature cut of @xmath140 for the unequal wind analysis .",
    "as expected , the temperature distribution changes very little when only the mass - loss rate is modified .",
    "the total post - shock volume above @xmath141 in @xmath65 is lower by @xmath142 compared to @xmath61 .",
    "the difference in volume in each bin is roughly constant over @xmath143 . when the wind velocity is modified , however , there is much less volume at a given temperature above the cutoff , and the peak temperature is slightly lower .",
    "since the secondary star has a lower wind velocity , the temperature of the secondary s shocked wind is much lower than that of the primary . due to the relation above",
    ", we expect the shocked wind of the secondary to fall below the temperature cutoff .",
    "@xmath67 should then have the same temperature distribution above @xmath144 as @xmath61 , but with the volume in all bins reduced by a constant factor . since there is @xmath145 less post - shock volume at all temperatures above @xmath146 ,",
    "there is also @xmath145 less volume in each bin in the range @xmath147 .",
    "we histogram the power per unit volume from gas with @xmath148 and find that the volume peaks at low power / volume .",

    ", @xmath67 also has less volume per bin .",
    "as with the temperature distribution , the reason for this is that the secondary s shocked wind is at too low a temperature to be included in the analysis , resulting in less emission .",
    "@xmath67 has a much higher maximum power / volume than @xmath61 and @xmath65 .",
    "the time - averaged power radiated by free - free emission from gas with @xmath149 is @xmath150 lower for @xmath65 and @xmath151 lower for @xmath67 than for @xmath61 .",
    "the standard deviation in this value is @xmath152 of the mean for @xmath61 , @xmath153 for @xmath65 , and @xmath154 for @xmath67 .",
    "the kh instability appears to be strongest in the case where the wind velocities are unequal",
    ".    the column density should be different for both the modified wind velocity and mass - loss rate due to changes in the density .",
    "the column density over a full orbital period for these two cases is shown in figure [ fig : coluneq ] . the column density to the center of mass",
    "is not shown here because the post - shock region is no longer centered on that location .",
    "the mass density of the secondary is lower in @xmath65 and higher in @xmath67 compared to @xmath61 , resulting in a lower and higher column density , respectively , to the secondary at all phases . when the column density to the primary is at its minimum value , it is the same for the equal and unequal wind simulations because the line of sight passes only through the wind of the primary , which is unchanged .",
    "when the line of sight passes through both winds , the column density is higher in @xmath67 and lower in @xmath65 .",
    "the column density is at its minimum value for the shortest amount of time when the winds are equal .",
    "since the shock will wrap more tightly around the secondary than the primary , the line of sight will pass through only the wind of the primary for a larger range of phases when the winds are unequal .",
    "wr 20a is a binary system of nearly - identical wolf - rayet stars , likely type wn6 ha , on circular orbits with a period of 3.686 days ( rauw et al .",
    "the primary has an estimated mass of 82.7 m@xmath155 and the secondary 81.9 m@xmath155 , giving a mass ratio of 1.01 .",
    "this gives a semi - major axis for the system of @xmath156 , or @xmath157 .",
    "if we assume instead a mass ratio of 1.0 , taking @xmath158 , and use rauw s assumed wind velocity at the stagnation point of @xmath159 for each star , or @xmath160 , this would give @xmath161 .",
    "we also take rauw et al.s smooth - wind mass - loss rate of @xmath162 , or @xmath163 .",
    "we also assume @xmath73 ( wn ) .",
    "although @xmath54 for this system is smaller than any ratio we modeled , we can still put a lower bound on the importance of the coriolis force by comparing models @xmath56 and @xmath61 for this system .",
    "the wind mach numbers we used in our simulations are smaller than the actual values for this system , but since we are already in the strong - shock limit , this should nt have a qualitative effect on our results . for @xmath61 ,",
    "we find the power radiated by free - free emission to be @xmath164 for @xmath165 . for @xmath56",
    ", we find only @xmath166 .",
    "this is a difference of @xmath98 , even though we used a larger @xmath54 than is appropriate . without taking wind acceleration or radiative effects into account , we find that the orbital motion has a significant , although not easily measured , effect on the power radiated by free - free emission . unfortunately , by eq .",
    "( [ eq : alpharad ] ) , we find @xmath167 , meaning this system is actually quite radiative .",
    "had our simulations incorporated radiative driving of the wind , resulting in positive net wind acceleration , the increased wind velocity would likely cause the thickness of the post - shock region to decrease , with the largest effect furthest from the line of centers .",
    "the modified velocity profile would also give an effective @xmath54 that increases with distance from the line of centers , which might also cause the shocks to wrap more tightly around the stars .",
    "the former effect would cause the wind to impact the shock front at a more oblique angle , while the latter would have the same effect on the trailing side of the shock and the opposite effect on the leading side .",
    "these two effects , combined with the increased wind velocity , makes determining the change in the post - shock temperature distribution difficult .    for an isolated star ,",
    "gravity acts against the radiative driving of the wind , leading to a different velocity profile in the unshocked wind , with lower velocities than those expected without gravity .",
    "when these modified winds collide , the thickness of the post - shock region far from the line of centers would be increased significantly , leading to a larger post - shock volume .",
    "gravity acts not only on the unshocked winds , but also on the post - shock gas , however . in the post - shock region between a pair of equal - mass stars that are held stationary , the force due to gravity would pull the post - shock gas toward the stagnation point .",
    "this would lead to an enhanced density near the plane normal to the line of centers , which would likely result in a decrease in temperature near the contact surface .",
    "this discussion is based on simple expectations ; a complete exploration of the effect of gravity on the post - shock flow will require 3d simulations in which it is included .",
    "since a higher ratio of @xmath54 in our simulations corresponds to an increased stellar mass , the effects due to gravity will increase with decreasing orbital period .",
    "we find that the escape velocity for @xmath3 at a distance of @xmath168 from the stagnation point is roughly equal to the unshocked wind velocity at the stagnation point .",
    "clearly gravity will have a strong influence on the post - shock region in the absence of radiative driving for systems with a large coriolis force , therefore conducting simulations that include both the effects of gravity and radiative driving is the logical next step .",
    "this , however , is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our analysis in  [ sec : circsurvey ] shows that , although the orbital motion has little effect on the peak temperature and density along the line of centers between the stars , it can have a significant effect on the temperature and emissivity of the gas elsewhere in the post - shock region .",
    "it also impacts the light curves by changing the time - dependence of the attenuation and allows for the k - h instability even when the winds are identical .",
    "the shape of the shocked region changes substantially when orbital motion is added , causing the distance between the stars and the shock fronts to decrease .",
    "the shocks also have a rotational velocity once orbital motion is considered , causing a difference in the shock strength on the leading and trailing sides . while we did not consider radiative effects or gravitational forces that would cause the wind velocity to vary with distance from the star , adding these effects",
    "will likely have a large impact on the system .",
    "it therefore would be fruitful in the future to consider fully three - dimensional hydrodynamical models which include both radiative driving and gravity .",

    "simulations were performed in the ibm blue gene at princeton university , and on computational facilities supported by nsf grant ast-0216105 .",
    "the wind is generated by imposing the wind solution , described in  [ sec : windsol ] , onto a sphere of radius @xmath25 , called the masked region , before every time step .",
    "the values of the density , pressure , and velocity vector within each cell in the masked region are computed using the volume - average of the analytic wind solution over the cell , for example for the density @xmath169 where @xmath170 is the volume of the cell and @xmath171 .",
    "a similar formula is used for the pressure .",
    "the radial unit vector , @xmath172 , is also averaged in this manner , and is used as the direction of the wind velocity in each grid cell within the mask in the reference frame of the star . since the stars are moving , in the reference frame of the grid",
    "the wind velocity is then @xmath173 where @xmath174 is the stellar velocity .",
    "the momentum density vector and the energy density are then calculated from the cell - averaged pressure , mass density , and velocity using @xmath175 and @xmath176 the singularity in the density and pressure at the center of the star and the issue of dynamic range in the simulation are handled simultaneously by imposing a maximum density and pressure , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , before averaging .",
    "these maxima fall at @xmath179 .",
    "the integrals of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : rhoavg ] ) are approximated using quadratures by dividing each cell into @xmath180 segments and then using the midpoint rule .",
    "since space is discretized on the grid , cells which fall only partially within the masked region are treated as such",
    ". the new grid values for these cells are a linear combination of the previous value and the masked value , @xmath181 where @xmath182 and @xmath183 is the fraction of the cell s volume covered by the mask .",
