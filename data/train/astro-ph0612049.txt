    "the solar neighborhood is an invaluable laboratory for the chemical evolution models because the number of free parameters is similar to the number of observational constraints .",
    "a number of different assumptions are typically adopted by chemical evolution models of a galactic zone : i ) the galactic zone formation mechanism and formation time , ii ) when , how many , and what types of stars are formed , iii ) when those stars die , and , iv ) which are the chemical abundances of the material ejected during the life and death of the stars .",
    "once a chemical evolution model for the solar vicinity satisfies the observational constraints , it is also possible to test both the galaxy formation process and the properties of the underlying stellar populations . therefore , the accuracy of the stellar and hii regions abundances estimations define the strength of our tests .    for that reason ,",
    "this review is in large extent based on new data for the solar neighborhood : i ) hii regions obtained by esteban , peimbert and collaborators ( see bresolin in this volume ) and ii ) f and g dwarf stars obtained by bensby and feltzing ( see both of them in this volume ) .",
    "also i will compare these data to the abundances of other galactic components and other galaxies , in particular to bulge stars and extragalactic hii regions , in order to analyze the origin of the abundance trends at high metallicity .",
    "the definition of  solar vicinity \" has several interpretations ranging from a zone including all low redshift galaxies until a region as small as the one including the stars within 1 pc of the sun . in the chemical evolution context",
    "the solar vicinity corresponds to a cylinder centered around the sun , at 8 kpc from the galactic center , that includes objects belonging to the galactic halo and disk .",
    "the dimensions of this cylinder depend on the locations of the objects used as observational constraints .",
    "typical adopted dimensions are 1 kpc in radius and @xmath1 3 kpc in height , for a cylinder oriented orthogonally from the galactic plane .",
    "since i am interesting in ( super ) metal rich objects , i will focus on objects with metallicity near or higher than solar .",
    "the photospheric solar abundances provide the reference pattern for general abundance determinations in the universe ( stars , ionized nebulae , galaxies ) and , the inferred initial solar abundances correspond to the interstellar medium ( ism ) of the solar neighborhood 4.5 gyr ago . during the last @xmath1 20 years the observational estimations of photospheric solar abundances regarding the most abundant heavy elements , like c ,",
    "n , o , and ne , have decreased their value .    in table 1",
    "i show the chemical abundance determinations for some common elements in the solar photosphere computed by anders & grevesse ( 1989 , ag89 ) , grevesse & sauval ( 1998 , gs98 ) , and asplund , grevesse & sauval ( 2005 , ags05 ) .",
    "these abundances are in 12 + log(xi / h ) by number , i have added the values of the mass fraction of he and metals , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "i also present the decreasing factors in the abundance determinations between the anders & grevesse work and the asplund et al .",
    "data and between the grevesse & sauval work and the asplund et al . data .",
    "since fe is one of the most common elements and the value of its solar photospheric determination has kept almost constant during the last years , i will compare the available stellar data based on [ fe / h ] .",
    "for hii regions , i will consider the o / h value determined in those nebulae as the reference ratio , since fe is strongly dust depleted in ionized nebulae .    in order to reproduce the helioseismology observations , sun models require more metals than the solar @xmath3 value obtained by asplund et al .",
    "bahcall et al . ( 2006 ) considering the photospheric metallicity of the sun determined by asplund et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the initial solar metallicity , @xmath4 , is 0.01405 , 15 % more metals than those observed in the solar photosphere .",
    "this difference is due to diffusive setting of the elements in the photosphere during the last 4.5 gyr , the age of the sun ( for details , see carigi & peimbert 2007 ) .",
    "this fact has implications for the chemical evolution models , because the solar abundances in the photosphere have been taken as representative of the abundances of ism when the sun was born , but those photospheric solar abundances should be corrected by solar diffusion .",
    "moreover , the diffusive settling effect should be considered in the abundance determinations of other stars , taking into account that the amount of material settled depends on the stellar age .    during this review",
    "i assumed that @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 as the photospheric , initial , and canonical solar metallicity , respectively .",

    "abundance estimations in hii regions give us the preset - day abundances , for that reason they are very important chemical evolution models .",
    "esteban et al .",
    "( 2005 ) based on c and o recombination lines derived the c / h and o / h values of 8 galactic hii regions .",
    "they found higher c / h and o / h values than the photospheric solar ones for the orion nebula and other 5 galactic hii regions closer to the galactic center ( see fig .",
    "2 ) . these values are in agreement with the c / h estimations derived by slavin & frish ( 2006 , and references therein ) , who find c / h @xmath9 , a value higher than solar ( photospheric and internal ) , along one line of sight of the local interstellar cloud . hii regions gradients , particularly in the inner galactic disk , might be useful to analyze the chemical enrichment at high metallicities .",
    "discussion on the abundances of galactic and extragalactic metal rich hii regions , and also the different methods of abundances determinations have been presented by bresolin ( 2007 and this volume ) . since different methods to determine abundances provide different chemical abundances , a consensus in the abundances determinations for hii regions is required .",
    "one of the most fundamental cosmochemistry observational results is the age-[fe / h ] relation because it links the age of the different dwarf stars with their chemical properties .",
    "this relation presents a large scatter along all of the metallicity range and metal rich stars are no exception . according to bensby et al .",
    "( 2005 ) thin disk stars with [ fe / h]@xmath10 present ages between 3 and 9 gyr , but stars with @xmath11 [ fe / h]@xmath12 have ages between 0 and 6 gyr . according to soubiran & girard ( 2006 ) the mean age of the thin disk stars of [ fe / h]@xmath13 is 5 gyr with a dispersion of 3.4 gyr , while the mean age of stars of @xmath14[fe / h]@xmath12 is 3.8 with a dispersion of 2.1 gyr .",
    "the dispersion is partly caused by stars born at other galactocentric radii with different star formation histories ( sfhs ) that migrated to the solar vicinity .",
    "since this stellar migration requires time , rocha - pinto et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that the solar neighborhood has been polluted by old and metal poor stars from inner and outer radii ( between 6 and 9.5 kpc ) .",
    "the age dispersion of the metal rich stars might be explained by a superposition of young stars that were born in the solar vicinity and by old stars that were born at inner radii with an early and efficient star formation rate ( sfr ) as chemical evolution models of the galactic disk predict ( e.g. carigi et al . 2005 ) .",
    "an alternative explanation for the age dispersion presented in the age-[fe / h ] relation are mergers of one or several satellite galaxies with different sfhs .",
    "other important observational constraints are provided by the [ xi / fe ] vs [ fe / h ] relations derived by dwarf stars in the solar neighborhood .",
    "these relations give information to infer the past of the solar vicinity and the properties of its stellar populations .    * @xmath15 enhancement *    some studies have found @xmath16 enhancement in thick disk stars compared to the thin disk stars in the @xmath17 [ fe / h ] @xmath18 range ( feltzing in this volume and references therein ) . no chemical evolution model that assumes a simple formation for the disk can reproduce that behavior .",
    "but , in the literature there are some models with complex disk formation histories that can explain the @xmath16 enhancement :    \\i ) nykytyuk & mishenina ( 2006 ) suggest a two - zone model with different gas infalls and sfhs for the thick and the thin disks .",
    "their model can reproduce the @xmath16 enhancement in the thick disk stars compared to the thin disk stars , but not the dispersion in the age - [ fe / h ] relation .",

    "part of the gas of the thick disk was leftover by shock heating , then the thin disk formed from primordial infalling gas and the pre - enriched gas by the thick disk stars that falls later onto the thin disk .",

    "therefore , i will study the dependence of [ xi / fe ] with the different ingredients of a chemical evolution model , in order to find an explanation of the [ xi / fe ] trends presented by metal rich stars of the galactic thin disk .",
    "it is well known that the [ xi / fe ] ratios depend on gas flows , star formation rates , initial mass function , and stellar yields , being the last two ones the most important factors .",

    "rich outflows with snia material increase [ xi / fe ] but they also decrease [ fe / h ] preventing the formation of metal rich stars",
    ". a metal rich gas infall of overabundant elements present in metal rich stars , like na , can reproduce the [ xi / fe ] raise , but how does the infalling gas get those [ xi / fe ] values ?",
    "brook et al .",

    "reddy ( in this meeting ) showed a secondary peak in that [ fe / h ] distribution for [ fe / h ] @xmath23 .",
    "an inclusion of a significant amount of stars ( or gas that triggered the star formation ) from a merger event could explain the secondary peak .",
    "if the thin disk metal rich stars formed in one o several galactic satellites that settled in the galactic disk , how did the stars of those satellites reach supersolar [ fe / h ] with ( super)solar [ xi / fe ] ?    based on the merger scenario , the bulge also formed by satellites that fell early in the milky way , therefore the origin of old and metal rich stars of the bulge and galactic disk is in small galaxies or metal rich stars form of the material comes from small structures , but again , how did those structures reach [ xi / fe]@xmath23 ?    based on another scenario",
    "the bulge could form by the stars that were born in the inner galactic disk and were dynamically heating by the bar ( coln et al .",
    "moreover , the same bar could be able to produce radial flows of stars from the inner to the outer part of the galactic disk .",
    "therefore the metal rich stars of the bulge and the solar neighborhood formed in the inner disk , but how did the inner disk reach [ xi / fe]@xmath23 ?",
    "radial gradients can be powerful tools to decide if metal rich stars observed in the solar vicinity and the bulge formed in situ or alternatively were formed in inner galactocentric radius or merged satellites . in the most complicated case ( or the most realistic ) a combination of these three ones should be the answer .",
    "therefore , stellar or gaseous infalls can explain the abundance trends observed for @xmath27 > -0.1 $ ] but they pose the question of how could these infalls get those ( super ) solar [ xi / fe ] values ?      important changes in the star formation rate , affect the [ xi / fe ] ratios mainly after a significant star formation burst ( e.g. carigi et al . 1999 , 2002 ;",
    "chiappini 2001 ) .",
    "the spiral wave is the most important inner mechanism that triggers star formation and that recently could have formed stars from a metal - rich gas .",

    "( 2000 ) inferred the star formation history from the color magnitude diagram for the solar vicinity .",
    "they found : i ) a decreasing exponential general behavior of the sfh in the last @xmath1 10 gyr , and ii ) variations from the general behavior related directly to the spiral wave passages .",
    "based on these results , it is found that there were no significant bursts of star formation in the last @xmath1 6 gyrs , therefore it is unlikely that a burst could have modified the [ xi / fe ] slope .",
    "an important fact is that metal rich stars with similar [ xi / fe ] values have been observed in the solar neighborhood and in the bulge , galactic components with different sfhs .",
    "the solar vicinity had a moderate sfr during 12 gyr , ( e.g. carigi et al .",
    "2005 ) while the bulge formed very quickly , in less than 0.5 gyr , with a high sfr ( ballero et al . and matteucci , both in this volume ) .",
    "therefore , i discard changes in the star formation rate as the explanation of the change in the [ xi / fe ] slopes for [ fe / h ] @xmath28 .",
    "the initial mass function , imf , gives the mass distribution of the formed stars in a star formation burst .",
    "this function is parametrized by the slope for different mass ranges and by the lower and upper mass limits of the formed stars . since [ xi / fe ]",
    "depends strongly on the imf , a dependence of the imf with metallicity , density or gas mass could explain the change of the [ xi / fe ] slope .",
    "according to kroupa ( in this volume ) there is no evidence that the imf changes with @xmath3 .",
    "nevertheless , bonnell suggested ( in this meeting ) that the imf changes with @xmath3 : for supersolar metallicities the slope for massive stars ( ms ) could be steeper and the upper limit could be lower than for subsolar metallicities , producing [ xi / fe ] subsolar values , in contradiction with the observed values .    in a metal rich gas",
    "it is more difficult to create ms due to the jeans mass dependence on @xmath29 and metal rich stars truncate the star formation process by their stellar winds .",
    "this suggestion could explain the low ionization of the metal rich hii regions compared to that of hii regions with subsolar metallicity : in a metal rich gas the number of ms may be lower leading to a smaller number of ionizing photons , on the other hand , the lower stellar temperatures of the metal rich stars help to to reduce the number of ionizing photons , further work on this suggestion needs to be done .    the imf dependence on the gas density should be less important , because the same abundance trends have been observed in galactic components with different densities ( bulge , open clusters , isolated dwarfs ) , but with a same property : super solar metallicity .",
    "according to weidner & kroupa ( 2005 ) the imf depends on gas mass .",
    "they found that the slope and the upper mass limit change with gas mass available to form stars . in dwarf galaxies",
    "the upper mass limit is lower and the slope in the ms range is steeper producing lower [ xi / fe ] values than those of normal galaxies for elements synthesized only by ms .",
    "moreover , carigi & hernndez ( 2007 ) found important effects on the abundance ratios when the imf is stochastically populated .",
    "the [ o / fe ] values varied within three orders of magnitude for a stellar population of 500 m@xmath30 that enrich a gas mass of @xmath31 m@xmath30 .",
