    "in several local analysis problems arising in mathematical physics , control theory , dynamical systems e.t.c .",
    "one is led to consider the classification problem for pairs @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is a germ of a closed 2-form on a manifold @xmath5 and @xmath2 is a function germ , with or without singularities .",
    "the most studied case is when the 2-form is nondegenerate , i.e. it defines a symplectic structure on @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath2 can be viewed as a hamiltonian function and the classification problem reduces to the well known problem of symplectic classification of singularities of functions ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . in this direction ,",
    "the 2-dimensional problem is drastically different than the higher dimensional one .",
    "indeed , a symplectic structure on the plane is an area ( volume ) form and the classification of hamiltonian functions on the plane becomes a problem of volume - preserving geometry .",
    "there , analytic normal forms exist in abundance ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite as well as @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for related results ) in contrast to the symplectic category @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider a generalisation of the classification problem for pairs @xmath0 on a 2-manifold @xmath5 , where now the 2-form @xmath1 is allowed to have singularities and thus it does not define a symplectic structure everywhere on @xmath5 .",
    "this situation is typical when we consider hamiltonian systems with constraints ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .    in analogy with the unconstrained case",
    ", we may define a constrained hamiltonian system ( chs ) on a 2-manifold @xmath5 , simply as a pair @xmath0 consisting of a function @xmath2 and a 2-form @xmath1 on @xmath5 as above .",
    "one may obtain such a system as the restriction of a hamiltonian system in a general ambient symplectic manifold , on a 2-dimensional surface representing the constraints .",
    "let @xmath6 be the `` hamiltonian vector field '' associated to the pair @xmath0 through the equation : @xmath7 this vector field is in general not defined and smooth everywhere on @xmath5 .",
    "the obstruction to the existence and/or uniqueness of @xmath6 is obviously the set of zeros @xmath3 of the 2-form @xmath1 . in the theory of singularities of constraints systems ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) it is called the _ impasse hypersurface _ , while in the theory of differential systems is usually called the _ martinet hypersurface _ ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) , in honor of j. martinet who was the first who studied systematically singularities of differential forms @xcite .",
    "the problem is thus to classify chs at impasse points ( away from the impasse points the problem reduces to the ordinary symplectic classification of functions ) .",
    "it is easy to see that the germ of a generic singular 2-form @xmath1 on the plane can be reduced to martinet normal form @xcite : @xmath8 the geometric invariants of the 2-form @xmath1 on the plane are just its martinet curve of zeros @xmath9 , along with an orientation ( in the real analytic ( smooth ) case ) induced by the two symplectic structures in its complement .",
    "the orientation of the martinet curve plays no role in the initial definition of singularity classes for the pair @xmath10 and thus , all the singularities are defined by the relative positions of the germ @xmath2 with the martinet curve . in particular , the pair @xmath11 can be viewed as defining a germ of a `` boundary singularity '' at the origin of the plane i.e. such that :    * either @xmath2 has an isolated critical point at the origin , * or @xmath2 is non - singular but its restriction @xmath12 on the martinet curve has an isolated critical point at the origin .",
    "thus , in order to study the singularities of pairs @xmath0 , one may fix an arbitrary boundary singularity @xmath13 and study possible normal forms of degenerate 2-forms @xmath1 , whose zero set @xmath3 is exactly the curve @xmath14 , under the action of the pseudogroup @xmath15 of diffeomorphisms preserving the boundary singularity .",
    "the study of isolated boundary singularities has been initiated by v. i. arnold in @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for general references ) where he extended the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 classification of simple singularities to include also the @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 series of weyl groups in the scheme of singularity theory . the list of simple normal forms obtained by arnold is given for convenience in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "llll @xmath22 & @xmath23 & @xmath24 & @xmath25 + @xmath26 & @xmath27 & @xmath28 & @xmath29 + @xmath30 & @xmath31 & @xmath31 & @xmath32 +    the number @xmath33 in the list is an important invariant .",
    "it is called the milnor number , or the multiplicity of the boundary singularity and it is intimately related with the classification problem of pairs @xmath0 we will study , as is the ordinary milnor number of an isolated singularity in the symplectic case ( c.f . @xcite and also @xcite ) .",
    "the manifestation of the milnor number in symplectic ( isochore in higher dimensions ) classification problems in the ordinary ( without boundary ) case , is due to the following fact : the corresponding deformation space of a germ of a symplectic form @xmath1 on the plane ( relative to diffeomorphisms preserving the germ @xmath2 ) is exactly equal to the brieskorn module of the singularity @xmath2 and in particular , according to the brieskorn - deligne - sebastiani theorem @xcite , @xcite , any such deformation space will be a free module of rank equal to the milnor number of @xmath2 , over the ring @xmath34 of analytic functions on ( the values of ) @xmath2 .",
    "thus , the classification problem reduces to a problem of relative de - rham cohomology .",
    "the classification problem in the martinet case which we will study here , is not much different than the symplectic classification problem , despite the fact that the corresponding relative de - rham cohomology theory for isolated boundary singularities has not yet been established in the literature .",
    "in particular one may conjecture , in analogy with the ordinary case , that the number of functional invariants in the classification of pairs @xmath0 is exactly equal to the milnor number of the boundary singularity @xmath4 and moreover , there exists a normal form for the pair involving exactly these invariants ( which by the way will be analytic functions of 1-variable ) . here",
    "we will prove this statement only for the special case where the pair @xmath4 is a quasihomogeneous boundary singularity ( theorem [ t2 ] ) and in particular for any of the simple germs in arnold s list in table [ tab:1 ] ( as well as for other unimodal , e.t.c .",
    "boundary singularities which are still quasihomogeneous c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite for the corresponding lists ) .",
    "our proof for the quasihomogeneous case is very similar ( almost identical in some parts ) to the one proposed by j. p. francoise in @xcite , @xcite for the ordinary case .",
    "while not that general , in order to include all isolated boundary singularities ( i.e. away from arnold s list ) , francoise s method has the advantage that it is algorithmic in nature : one may construct step by step the characteristic invariants of the pair @xmath0 as well as the bounds of the corresponding norms .",
    "also it has minimum prerequisites , such as the relative poincar lemma and the relative de - rham s division lemma ( see section 2 ) , while a general proof should go through several sheaf theoretic techniques .",
    "thus , a main part of the paper is to prove ( theorem [ t1 ] ) that the corresponding deformation module of a martinet 2-form @xmath1 ( relative to diffeomorphisms preserving a simple boundary singularity @xmath4 ) is a free @xmath34-module of rank equal to the milnor number of the boundary singularity , i.e. equal to the corresponding number @xmath33 in table [ tab:1 ] .    one final remark : the classification of functions @xmath2 and martinet 2-forms @xmath1 in higher dimensions is a much more complicated problem and the results of this paper do not generalise in this case .",
    "probably , formal normal forms do exist but we do nt discuss this here . instead , we give an application of the 2-dimensional results in a problem arising in the geometric theory of hamiltonian systems with constraints , that is , the problem of classification of generic singular lagrangians ( of first order in the velocities ) on the plane , under variational ( gauge ) equivalence ( theorem [ tl ] ) .",
    "such lagrangians , already studied by dirac @xcite for the purposes of quantisation and which appear in high energy physics ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , in hydrodynamics and general vortex theory ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and references therein ) and also in control theory and sub - riemannian geometry @xcite ,",
    "@xcite , @xcite and several other instances , give rise to euler - lagrange equations which define a constrained hamiltonian system @xmath0 and thus , they are subjectable to the analysis in this paper .",
    "we fix a coordinate system @xmath35 at the origin of @xmath36 such that the boundary is given by the equation @xmath37 . to a boundary singularity @xmath13 we associate its local algebra ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath38 where the ideal @xmath39 in the denominator is the tangent space to the @xmath40-orbit of @xmath2 , i.e. under diffeomorphisms ( right - equivalences ) preserving the boundary @xmath14 ( as usual @xmath41 is the algebra of germs of analytic functions at the origin ) .",
    "we call it , in analogy with the ordinary case the _ jacobian ideal of the boundary singularity @xmath13_. its codimension , i.e. the @xmath42-dimension @xmath33 of the vector space @xmath43 is called the _ multiplicity _ or _ milnor number of the boundary singularity _ @xmath13 and it is an important invariant : it is related to the milnor number @xmath44 of @xmath2 : @xmath45 and the milnor number @xmath46 of its restriction @xmath47 on the boundary : @xmath48 by the formula : @xmath49    topologically it can be interpreted as the rank of the relative homology group @xmath50 of the pair @xmath51 , @xmath52 , of smooth milnor fibers of @xmath2 and @xmath53 , as one may easily deduce from the exact homology sequence induced by the inclusion @xmath54 ( the fiber @xmath55 consists of a finite number of points ) . in particular , according to a theorem of arnold @xcite which generalises milnor s theorem @xcite for the boundary case , the space @xmath56 has the homotopy type of a bouquet of @xmath33 circles .",
    "it follows that the pair @xmath51 is a riemann surface with betti number @xmath44 and @xmath57 distinguished points . for @xmath58 , the @xmath44 cycles of @xmath59 and the @xmath46 segments joining the distinguished points shrink at the origin :",
    "they are called vanishing cycles and half - cycles respectively and they form a basis of @xmath50 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "denote now by @xmath60 , the complex of germs of analytic differential forms at the origin ( where @xmath61 the algebra of analytic functions ) and by @xmath62 the subcomplex of forms that `` vanish on @xmath37 '' , in the sense that their coefficients belong in the ideal @xmath63 generated by the equation of @xmath14 .",
    "notice that any form vanishing on @xmath14 vanishes automatically when evaluated at tangent vectors of @xmath14 ( i.e. it has zero pull back by the embedding @xmath64 ) , but the converse does not hold ( take for example the 1-form @xmath65 ) .",
    "we distinguish by writing @xmath66 for the space of @xmath67-forms with zero pull - back on @xmath14 .",
    "notice that with this notation @xmath68 , @xmath69 ( identically ) and @xmath70 .",
    "the space @xmath71 may be identified with the space of 2-forms whose zero set contains the curve @xmath37 .",
    "we write @xmath72 for the space of martinet 2-forms ( with zero set exactly equal to @xmath14 ) .",
    "we will need the following local version of a type of relative poincar lemma for the complex @xmath73 ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) :    [ l1 ] for any closed @xmath67-form @xmath74 there exists an @xmath75-form @xmath76 such that @xmath77 .    by the classical poincar lemma the 1-parameter family of maps @xmath78 , @xmath79 $ ] , is a contraction at the origin , it preserves @xmath14 , @xmath80 and is such that : @xmath81 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is defined by @xmath85 and the vector field @xmath86 is defined as the generator of @xmath87 .",
    "notice that by definition @xmath88 is tangent to @xmath14 for all @xmath89 .",
    "now , since @xmath90 vanishes on @xmath14 to second order , the @xmath75-form @xmath91 vanishes also on @xmath14 and since @xmath88 is tangent to @xmath14 it follows that @xmath92 . by the fact that @xmath93 , it follows that @xmath76 .",
    "fix now a pair @xmath13 , where @xmath2 has an isolated singular point at the origin of finite multiplicity @xmath94 . the differential @xmath95 defines an ideal in the algebra @xmath60 of germs of differential forms at the origin , which induces an ideal in all the subalgebras @xmath62 , and @xmath96 we consider .",
    "the lemma below gives necessary and sufficient conditions for the ideal membership problem .",
    "it is an analog in the relative case of de - rham s division lemma @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "[ l2 ]    * let @xmath97 .",

    "* the proof is an obvious calculation * it suffices to show that the relative de - rham s division lemma is true for the complex @xmath105 : indeed , if we write @xmath106 for some @xmath107 , then @xmath108 and since @xmath109 is a non - zero divisor it will follow from the relative de - rham division lemma in @xmath105 that there exists a function @xmath110 such that @xmath111 .",
    "but then @xmath112 and the germ @xmath113 as we wanted . to show now that the relative division lemma is true in @xmath114 it suffices to notice that the condition @xmath115 for any 1-form @xmath116 forces it again to be of the form @xmath117 for some @xmath118-form @xmath119",
    ". indeed , this follows from restriction @xmath120 and the fact that @xmath121 ( because @xmath2 has isolated singularities ) .",
    "then , as before , the equation @xmath122 implies that @xmath123 and thus , by the ordinary de rham division lemma , there exists a function germ @xmath124 such that @xmath125 .",
    "thus @xmath126 and the lemma is proved .",
    "it is important to notice here that the condition @xmath115 implied on a 1-form @xmath90 vanishing on @xmath14 ( i.e. for @xmath116 or @xmath101 ) prevents it from being closed ( = exact ) .",
    "indeed , @xmath127 means that the function @xmath128 is constant on the fibers of @xmath2 and thus it is a holomorphic function on the values of @xmath2 : @xmath129 .",
    "but then , since @xmath128 should vanish on @xmath130 it means that it should vanish everywhere in the neighborhood under consideration ( because the fibers of @xmath2 are almost everywhere transversal to @xmath130 ) .",
    "by the extension of tougeron s theorem on the finite determinacy of boundary singularities @xmath13 proved by v. i. matov @xcite we may suppose that @xmath37 and @xmath2 is polynomial of sufficiently high degree ( @xmath131 ) .",
    "write @xmath15 for the pseudogroup of symmetries of the pair @xmath13 . in the following lemma",
    "we identify the set of ( infinitesimal ) trivial deformations of martinet 2-forms relative to @xmath15-action :    [ l3 ] let @xmath1 be a germ of a martinet 2-form .",
    "the tangent space to the orbit of @xmath1 under the @xmath15-action consists of all 2-forms of the form : @xmath132    let @xmath133 be an element of the lie algebra @xmath134 .",
    "the infinitesimal deformation of @xmath1 associated to @xmath133 is by definition an element of the form @xmath135 ( where @xmath136 is the lie derivative ) .",
    "we have that @xmath137 and thus , by de - rham s division with @xmath95 , there exists a function germ @xmath138 such that @xmath139 . since the 1-form @xmath140 vanishes on @xmath14 to second order ( because both @xmath133 and @xmath1 vanish on @xmath14 ) we conclude that @xmath103 .",
    "it follows that @xmath141 , @xmath103 .",
    "conversely , let @xmath103 be such that there exists a vector field @xmath133 with @xmath142 . in fact define @xmath133 as the dual of the 1-form @xmath143 through @xmath1 : @xmath144 ( this is possible because @xmath138 vanishes on @xmath14 ) .",

    "thus @xmath146 and the lemma is proved .",
    "it follows that the quotient space @xmath147 consists of the nontrivial infinitesimal deformations of the martinet 2-form @xmath1 relative to the symmetries of the boundary singularity .",
    "along with the @xmath42-linear space structure , the deformation space @xmath148 ( which we will denote simply by @xmath149 ) has a natural @xmath34-module structure with multiplication by @xmath2 .",
    "we call it the _ deformation module of the martinet germ @xmath1_. in the next section we will show that this module is a free module of rank @xmath94 over @xmath34 .",
    "this statement is analogous to the classical brieskorn - deligne - sebastiani theorem @xcite , @xcite for ordinary singularities ( i.e. without boundary ) .",
    "this finiteness result along with the following proposition are cornerstones in the classification problem .    [ p1 ]",
    "fix a boundary singularity @xmath13 .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath150 be two germs of martinet 2-forms at the origin , such that @xmath151 .",

    "the proof is by the homotopy method .",
    "consider a 1-parameter family of martinet 2-forms connecting @xmath1 and @xmath150 : @xmath154 so that @xmath155 and @xmath156 .",

    "choose @xmath159 by @xmath160 .",
    "it preserves @xmath161 and it is also in @xmath134 by the same reasoning as in the previous lemma .",
    "it follows that the time 1-map of the flow @xmath162 of @xmath159 sends @xmath163 to @xmath164 .",
    "the classical brieskorn - deligne - sebastiani theorem for an isolated singularity @xmath2 @xcite , @xcite and also @xcite , states that the quotient space @xmath165 is a free @xmath34-module of rank equal to the milnor number of the singularity @xmath2 .",
    "it is proved using sheaf theoretic techniques and the properties of the gauss - manin connection on the vanishing cohomology bundle associated to the singularity .",
    "for some special cases of singularities though , other simpler proofs exist ( c.f .",
    "@xcite , @xcite for the morse case ) . for the class of all quasihomogeneous singularities a proof was given by j. p. franoise in @xcite",
    "( see also @xcite ) .",

    "franoise s algorithm is rather general and it holds also in the global , polynomial case ( c.f .",
    "@xcite ) . here",
    "we will provide the necessary modifications to include the boundary case as well .",
    "in particular we will prove :    [ t1 ] let @xmath13 be a quasihomogeneous boundary singularity at the origin of milnor number @xmath33 and let @xmath1 be a germ of a martinet 2-form whose zero set is exactly the curve @xmath14 .",
    "then the deformation module of @xmath1 is a free module of rank @xmath33 over @xmath34 : @xmath166    to prove the theorem , suppose that @xmath2 is a quasihomogeneous polynomial of type @xmath167 , @xmath168 , i.e. such that @xmath169 .",
    "denote by @xmath170 the euler vector field of @xmath2 , i.e. such that @xmath171 .",
    "write also @xmath172",
    ". then the following division lemma holds :    [ divlem ] if @xmath13 is a quasihomogeneous boundary singularity at the origin of the plane , then the following identity holds : @xmath173    it suffices to find , for a given 1-form vanishing on the boundary @xmath99 , a 2-form @xmath174 and a function @xmath175 vanishing on the boundary to second order , such that @xmath176 but @xmath177 and so the equality above reduces to @xmath178 i.e. to @xmath179 taking exterior differential , it suffices to find @xmath180 such that : @xmath181 we view @xmath182 as an operator in formal series : @xmath183 this is obviously an invertible operator since for any monomial @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 we have : @xmath187 where @xmath188 never vanishes .",

    "<S> we consider only the case where @xmath1 is singular , i.e. it vanishes non - degenerately along a smooth line @xmath3 ( martinet case ) and the function @xmath2 is such that the pair @xmath4 defines an isolated boundary singularity . in analogy with the ordinary case ( for symplectic forms on the plane ) </S>",
    "<S> we show that the moduli in the classification problem are analytic functions of 1-variable and that their number is exactly equal to the milnor number of the corresponding boundary singularity . </S>",
    "<S> moreover we derive a normal form for the pair @xmath0 involving exactly these functional invariants . </S>",
    "<S> finally we give an application of the results in the theory of constrained hamiltonian systems , related to the motion of charged particles in the quantisation limit in an electromagnetic field , which in turn leads to a list of normal forms of generic singular lagrangians ( of first order in the velocities ) on the plane .    </S>",
