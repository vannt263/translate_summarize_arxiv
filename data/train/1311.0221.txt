    "wire metamaterials have a number of unique properties  @xcite , including the possibility of the subwavelength image transfer  @xcite , negative refraction  @xcite and spontaneous emission time engineering  @xcite . localized modes in the slabs of wire metamaterial",
    "have been studied previously in a number of papers  @xcite , and it was shown that these modes are similar to the so - called spoof plasmons , a special class of surface modes , which propagate along corrugated metal or semiconductor surfaces  @xcite . furthermore , it has been shown that the excitation of the guided modes in the wire metamaterial slab is critical for the realization of the far - field superlensing  @xcite .    while the guided waves in the wire metamaterial slab have been studied previously  @xcite , there are no consistent studies of these modes that simultaneously account for the three distinctive features of these structures : the spatial dispersion of the dielectric permittivity ( arising from the nonlocality of the wire",
    "medium s response to electromagnetic field ) , the presence of the wire host medium with dielectric permittivity different from that in vacuum , and the presence of the inevitable losses . at the same time , such an analysis is currently extremely demanded , since the realizations of the wire medium at the moment exist for a wide range of frequencies spanning from microwave to the optical range , and both spatial dispersion and essential losses are present in these samples .",
    "thus , in order to correctly describe the effects being observed experimentally in the existing wire media samples , these features should be taken into account .    in this work ,",
    "we present a consistent analysis of the properties of the guided waves in the wire metamaterial slabs , which accounts for all aforementioned effects .",
    "we present two approaches to obtaining the dispresion equations for the eigenmodes of the waveguiding metamaterial slabs , both yielding the same results .",
    "we then analyze the obtained band structure of the symmetric and antisymmetric eigenmodes of the waveguide .",
    "we start from recalling the results for the local case ( when the dielectric permittivity of the metamaterial at a given position is assumed to be a function of that position only ) , and then compare with the obtained results for the nonlocal approach ( when the dielectric permittivity at a given position is a function of both that position and its neighborhood ) .",
    "we find , in particular , that the nonlocal effects lead to a strong coupling between `` fast '' and `` slow '' eigenmodes of the waveguide , manifested by anti - crossings of their dispersion curves .",
    "we also study how the losses in the host media affect the dispersion and the coupling of the guided modes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : setup ] we present the detailed problem setup ; in section  [ sec2 ] general impedance relations at the boundary of wire media slab are derived ; section  [ sec : tm_sas ] is dedicated to the derivation of the dispersion equation for the symmetric and antisymmetric guided modes ; band structures of the eigenmodes are presented in section [ sec : band ] and the profiles of the electric fields for different eigenmodes are presented in [ sec : profiles ] . in section  [ sec : losses ] it is shown how the losses in the structure affect the dispersion properties of the eigenmodes , and the conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we consider a planar slab of wire medium ( wm ) , composed of ideally conducting parallel thin wires ( oriented perpendicular to the slab surfaces ) , which are embedded in a uniform host medium with a constant dielectric permittivity @xmath0 .",

    "the bulk wire medium can be described as a _",
    "uniaxial _ spatially dispersive ( nonlocal ) medium with an effective dielectric permittivity tensor  @xcite ( we use si units throughout ) @xmath4 with @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the speed of light in the host medium of the wm ( we assume a non - magnetic host medium with @xmath7 ) , @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the `` plasma frequency '' of the wm with @xmath10 defined in eq .",

    "we consider electromagnetic waves propagating along the wm slab ; choosing axis @xmath15 along the direction of propagation , we have , without reducing generality of the problem , the following structure of the electromagnetic waves propagating in the considered structure : @xmath16 we note that , since the wm dielectric tensor ( [ eq : epsilon_wm ] ) is invariant with respect to rotations of coordinate frame around axis @xmath17 ( which is fixed by assuming that the wires are perpendicular to the slab boundaries ) , its form remains the same as ( [ eq : epsilon_wm ] ) in the chosen coordinate frame with axis @xmath15 directed along the direction of propagation of the guided modes .",
    "writing the maxwell s equations for @xmath18 and applying fourier transforms with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath15 ( but not @xmath17 ) , we obtain the following set of equations for the components of fourier - transformed fields @xmath20 and @xmath21 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 are the components of the fourier - transformed ( with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath15 ) effective current @xmath24 in the corresponding medium ( either wm or a cladding dielectric in our case ) , defined by the constitutive relations of the medium .",

    ". moreover , we notice the transition from the strong mode coupling regime resulting in the anticrossing behaviour for the real parts of mode frequencies , to the weak - coupling regime resulting in the anticrossing of the imaginary parts of the frequencies as the losses are increased .",
    "this effect is also widely observed in the microcavity physics , when the transition from the strong to the weak coupling regime manifests itself in the transition from the anticrossing of the modes frequencies to the anticrossing of the modes decay rates .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the dispersion of the eigenmodes of the wire medium slab taking into account both the spatial dispersion and the losses in the structure .",
    "we have shown that the eigenmodes can be separated in two specific types : slow surface plasmon - polariton modes and fast conventional electromagnetic waveguide modes .",
    "we have also observed the strong pairwise coupling between slow and fast modes of the same parity resulting in the anticrossing of the dispersion curves . we stress that this effect arises only within the nonlocal approach , and thus has not been described previously",

    ", we continue the fields and current densities , defined in the wire medium at @xmath92 , to the region @xmath93 as  @xcite @xmath94 and then continue these fields and current densities , now defined at @xmath95 , periodically to the entire @xmath17 axis , with a period of @xmath96 : @xmath97 , etc . thus continued fields and current densities are defined for all @xmath17 , and coincide with the physical fields and current densities inside the wire medium slab .",
    "this mathematical trick allows us to solve eqs  ( [ eq : tm_maxwell_wkz ] ) for fields inside the wm slab by seeking the solutions of eqs  ( [ eq : tm_maxwell_wkz ] ) , for thus continued fields and current densities , in the form of fourier series @xmath98 where @xmath40 , and @xmath99 implies that the @xmath100 term of the sum should be multiplied by @xmath101 .",
