    "why do some speakers at this 8th granada seminar give five lectures and expect a million euro honorarium , while others are allowed only to present a poster and have to pay a registration fee .",
    "the elites of all times and regions always had excellent reasons why they should be on top : they were kings by the grace of god , or university professors by their excellent work .",
    "indeed , at the age when albert einstein wrote about relativity , diffusivity and quantum photo effect as a technical expert at the patent office in bern , this author was already paid as university assistant , a position never reached by einstein .",
    "that s why this is this author s fourth contribution to these proceedings .    however , bad people @xcite find also other reasons for my position .",
    "the maxwell - boltzmann statistics for classical ideal gases gives air molecules a probability exp(@xmath0 ) to have a velocity vector * v*. if one air molecule has a velocity ten times higher than average , then statistical physicists see this as a normal though rare random event and do not associate any wonderful properties with this molecule . and",
    "this is how @xcite treats us : we got our position in society by accident .",
    "these authors are evil because bonabeau left academia and deneubourg gave a talk without a tie at a conference where all male speakers were asked months in advance to wear a tie .",
    "nevertheless we now look at their model , following rasputin s advice that one can reject sin only after having studied it .",
    "people diffuse on a square lattice filled with density @xmath1 . whenever a person wants to move onto a site already occupied by someone else , a fight erupts which is won by the invader with probability @xmath2 and lost with probability @xmath3 .",
    "if the invader wins , the winner moves into the contested site whereas the loser moves into the site left free by the winner ; otherwise nobody moves .",
    "each visitor adds @xmath4 to a history parameter @xmath5 , and each loss adds @xmath6 to @xmath5 . at each iteration ,",
    "the current @xmath5 is diminished by ten percent , so that roughly only the last ten time steps are kept in memory @xmath5 .",
    "the probability @xmath2 for fighter @xmath7 to win against fighter @xmath8 is a fermi function : @xmath9 \\eqno ( 1)\\ ] ] where the free parameter @xmath10 could be unity .",
    "initially everybody starts with @xmath11 ; then @xmath12 for all fights .",
    "after some time , history @xmath5 accumulates in memory , @xmath2 differs from 1/2 , and the standard deviation @xmath13 with @xmath14 measures the amount of inequalities in society at that time step @xmath15 and is obtained by averaging over all fights occuring during this iteration @xmath15 .",
    "this defines the model and the main quantity @xmath16 to look at . if instead one looks at the history of one person and integrates its @xmath5 over time , after sufficiently long times it averages to zero : who is on top at some time may be away from the top another time .",
    "real madrid has shown this to the football world : there is always one team winning the champions league , but it is not necessarily the same team each year .",
    "we find similar examples in the political powers dominating europe during the last two - thousand years .",
    "bonabeau et al @xcite found a phase transition in that for high densities the inequalities are strong , and for densities below some threshold they no longer exist .",
    "this effects corresponds to widespread feelings ( see the movie dances with wolves ) that social hierarchies developed only with agriculture and cities ( but what about the mongolian empire ? ) unfortunately that effect was based on an assumption which prevented equilibrium and let the @xmath17 go to infinity . when corrected , the phase transition vanished @xcite .",
    "the transition was restored @xcite by a feedback loop : the quantity @xmath10 in eq.(1 ) was replaced by the @xmath16 as calculated from eq.(2 ) at the previous time step .",
    "( for the first 10 time steps , @xmath16 was replaced by one . ) then a ( first - order ) transition was found again , fig.1 .",

    "this program unfortunately violates the gerling criterion that nobody should publish more program lines than ( s)he has years in life .",
    "thus i start with the core , after the comment line 41 : if the site jnew to which agent i wants to move is empty , latt(jnew ) = 0 , then the move is made : the position of the agent is now jnew , and the occupation variables of the sites j , jnew are interchanged .",
    "otherwise a fight starts between agent i and the present inhabitant k. the probability @xmath2 from eq.(1 ) is calculated ( with an escape if the argument of the exponential function is too large ) and taken into account in the averages for @xmath16 , eq.(2 ) .",
    "a random integer ibm , obtained by multiplication with 65539 ( or better 16807 as earlier ) , is compared after normalization with the probability @xmath2 of the invader i to win ; if i wins , again the occupation variables are interchanged , and so are the position variables ipos ; moreover , the history variables h are changes by @xmath18 .",

    "then the loop over all n agents ends , @xmath16 is evaluated and printed out . if @xmath19 or if the maximum number maxstep of iterations is reached , the simulation ends .",
    "if this model @xcite leads to hierarchies , then they are symmetric : there as many people on top as they are on bottom .",
    "reality is different : there are few leaders only .",
    "this asymmetry was partially reproduced by reducing the history counter @xmath5 by @xmath20 points , with for example @xmath21 , in the case of a loss , while a victory still increases @xmath5 by only one point @xcite .",
    "s martins in that paper @xcite also looked at scale - free networks of barabsi - albert type @xcite .",
    "this aspect was studied more thoroughly by gallos @xcite and sousa @xcite .",
    "it means we no longer fight about territory against whoever sits on the lattice site to which we want to move .",
    "instead we fight for power with our acquaintances . and the social network of acquaintances may be described by scale - free networks , where the number @xmath8 of neighbours for each site follows a probability distribution @xmath22 instead of having @xmath23 on the square lattice .",
    "details of the simulations differ , and so do their results @xcite , but the sharp phase transition was recovered .",
    "gallos finds it at a very low concentration @xmath24 , which moreover may decrease towards zero for increasing network size .",
    "a simpler network allows everybody to contact everybody , and also here abrupt changes in the amount @xmath16 of hierarchies were seen @xcite .",
    "other cases studied were erds - rnyi random graphs , watts - strogatz small - world networks , and triads where friends of my friends are likely also my own friends @xcite .",
    "even though the model was already published in 1995 , it seems to become fashionable only now with three independent papers in the first few months of 2005 @xcite .",
