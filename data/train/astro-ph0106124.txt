    "the behavior of eas size spectra in the knee region points out a possibility of a multi - component nature of the primary nuclear flux @xcite . as follows from @xcite , the best description of eas size spectra in the knee region",
    "may be achieved providing at least two components in the primary cosmic ray flux .",
    "confirmation of the multi - component origin of cosmic rays can be obtain by investigations of distribution of eas arrival directions . especially , it is interesting to measure of the anisotropy in the vicinity of the knee region ( @xmath2 ev ) where the accuracies of eas experiments in last years have significantly increased .",
    "+ in this paper , based on maket - ani @xcite eas data ( @xmath3 events with @xmath4 ) the equatorial coordinate distribution of eas arrival directions are investigated .",
    "violations of isotropy ( @xmath5 ) are obtained at energies @xmath6 pev .",
    "principal complications of the investigation of the eas ani- sotropy are :    1 .",
    "eas attenuation in the atmosphere ( the intensity of shower size @xmath7 strongly depends on a zenith angle of incidence ( @xmath8 ) at the given observation level ) ; 2 .",
    "dependence of the eas size on the energy ( @xmath9 ) and primary nucleus ( @xmath10 ) ; 3 .",
    "interruptions of exposition local time , which are inevitable in eas experiments .    factors 1 - 3",
    "do not allow in principle to apply the traditional ( on - off ) methods of measuring the cosmic - ray anisotropy and here , a simulation method is applied taking into account above factors in the frameworks of qgsjet interaction model + @xcite and predictions of the 2-component origin of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the test of this models by modern eas size spectra at different zenith angles and different observation levels one can find in papers @xcite .",
    "+ assume that the primary nuclear flux @xmath11 consists of isotropic @xmath12 and anisotropic @xmath13 components @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 are equatorial coordinates of anisotropic direction .        let also the factor of anisotropy @xmath16 is small ( @xmath17 ) and does not distort the eas zenith angular distribution due to the earth rotation and independence of eas attenuation on the azimuthal angle of incidence ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "+ then , providing each detected eas event from @xmath11 flux with horizontal coordinates @xmath19 and local time @xmath20 by adequate simulated event but from isotropic @xmath12 flux with corresponding coordinates @xmath21 and the same @xmath20 one can compare ( after transformation @xmath22 and @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) the obtained equatorial coordinate distributions of real eas data and isotropic simulated data . evidently ,",
    "if the anisotropic part of intensity @xmath27 then the distribution obtained from the experiment must overlap with the simulated one .",
    "any considerable discrepancies ( out of statistical errors ) will point out to the existence of anisotropy .",
    "+ the presented method completely solves the problems 1 and 3 , however , the same normalization of real and simulated distributions ( due to a flux @xmath28 ) is unknown ) does not give a direct possibility to determine the absolute intensity of the anisotropic component .",
    "+ taking the above into account , each detected eas event is characterized by a 9-dimensional vector @xmath29 @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the evaluation of a primary energy on the basis of the measured eas size @xmath32 and zenith angle @xmath8 , @xmath33 is a local time vector with components @xmath34  -year , @xmath35  -month , @xmath36  -day , @xmath37  -hour , @xmath38  -minute , @xmath39  -second of a detected event . here we used the vector definition only for briefness and convenience .",
    "+        the estimation of the primary energy @xmath9 by the measured eas size @xmath32 is performed by inverse interpolation of function @xmath40 at average primary nucleus @xmath41 @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 values are determined by 2-component primary spectra @xcite .",
    "a tabulated function @xmath44 at given @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath8 parameters of a primary nucleus was preliminary calculated by means of eas simulation using the corsika code @xcite at qgsjet interaction model @xcite .",
    "some details of this simulation one can find in the paper @xcite .",
    "statistical errors did not exceed @xmath45 and the high altitude location ( @xmath46g/@xmath47 ) of the ani experiment @xcite allowed to obtain @xmath48 .",
    "because the exposition time of the maket - ani array is not continuous and the eas zenith angular distribution does not adequate to the angular distribution of primary nuclei ( factors 1,3 above ) , we created @xmath49 simulated 9-dimensional vectors @xmath50 for each detected vector @xmath51 which differ from @xmath51 only by simulated primary energy ( @xmath52 ) , zenith ( @xmath53 ) and azimuth ( @xmath54 ) angles .",
    "+ the values of angles @xmath53 and @xmath54 are simulated according to distributions : @xmath55 and @xmath56 respectively",
    ". the energy ( @xmath52 ) of simulated events is obtained from 2-component primary energy spectra @xcite at additional condition of detected events @xmath57 .",
    "transformation of @xmath51 and @xmath58 vectors to simple 3-dimensional vectors @xmath59 and @xmath60 with @xmath61 -right ascension and @xmath62 -declination equatorial coordinates are performed by astronomical soft @xcite .",
    "the results of investigation of the eas anisotropy in the knee region by ani eas data are shown in fig .",
    "equatorial coordinate distributions @xmath63 and @xmath64 of all showers ( @xmath65 events at @xmath4 ) at six primary energy ( @xmath9 ) intervals are given in fig .",
    "1 . symbols are the maket - ani data @xmath63 and @xmath64 in terms of ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "solid lines are the expected adequate distributions @xmath67 and @xmath68 obtained by simulations of isotropic primary component ( off - component ) .",
    "local times @xmath20 of simulated events and detected eas events are equal .",
    "the total number of events is the same ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "dashed lines reflect the expected behavior of the isotropic component at an uniform local time distribution of each eas detected event .",
    "+ it is seen , that the distribution of a @xmath62-coordinate at all primary energies is practically independent on a local time distribution .",
    "moreover , a good agreement of expected and detected distributions for equatorial @xmath61-coordinate is observed in the energy range @xmath70 pev .",
    "+ however , the discrepancies of detected and expected distributions of the equatorial @xmath62-coordinate increase with the energy .",
    "strong disagreement is observed at @xmath6 pev and @xmath71 .",
    "it is necessary to note , that the real disagreement is a little larger than it is seen in fig .  1 because eas and simulated data have the same normalizations .",
    "further investigations of the @xmath62-coordinate distribution are given in fig .  2 where detected normalized all - particle primary energy spectra at different declinations ( @xmath62 ) are presented .",
    "black symbols are ani data .",
    "the open circles are expected energy spectra of isotropical simulated components ( off - component ) with 50 times higher statistics ( @xmath72 ) . + spectral shape in @xmath73 pev range for all declination intervals is determined by the lower limit of the detected eas size ( @xmath4 )",
    ". however , the observed fine structure of all - particle spectra at @xmath74 pev and declinations @xmath75 and @xmath76 can hardly be explained by trivial statistical fluctuations .",
    "all data in fig .",
    "1,2 are obtained in the framework of qgsjet interaction model @xcite and the 2-component origin of cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "from above analysis it follows that there is a partial anisotropic flux with a declination coordinate equal to @xmath77 at primary energies @xmath6 pev .",
    "the distribution of equatorial @xmath61-coordinates agrees with the hypothesis of the isotropic distributions of cosmic ray .",
    "+ it is interesting to note , that the nearest neutron stars psr0950 and psr1133 disposed at @xmath78 distance from the earth have declination coordinates @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively .",
    "these values are close to the results obtained here ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "are these neutron stars a reason of anisotropic flux or not can be elucidated only with significantly large eas statistics .    it is a pleasure to thank ashot chilingaryan for many helpful discussions about these matters .",
    "i thank lilith haroyan and hamlet martirosyan for their assistance during the work .",
    "i thank the members of the maket - ani group for providing eas data .",
