    "within a decade after the discovery of graphene flakes by mechanical exfoliation,@xcite numerous methods have been developed to create larger and cleaner samples , realized both as single layers and as stacked layers of graphene.@xcite    early on , it was realized that stacked graphene layers behave differently than both a single layer and 3d graphite .",
    "for example , in bilayer graphene the dispersion is quadratic instead of linear and the electrons behave as massive chiral particles , which is a completely new type of particle .",
    "few - layer graphene is still a 2d system , hence the quantum hall effect can be observed . for monolayer graphene",
    ", the plateaus in the hall conductivity are located at half integer multiples of @xmath4,@xcite originating from a landau level at zero energy which is half filled by electrons and half filled by holes . in bilayer graphene",
    ", this particular landau level has an extra degeneracy resulting in hall plateaus at integer values of @xmath4 and a quantum hall effect that is different from the one in a monolayer as well as from the quantum hall effect found in usual two dimensional electron gases.@xcite in addition to the number of layers , the order of the stacking also influences the physical properties significantly .    in multilayer graphene",
    ", the different layers can have three distinct orientations with respect to the bottom one .",
    "bernal stacking ( or @xmath5 stacking ) is the configuration in which the @xmath6 sublattice of the odd layers are opposite to the @xmath7 sublattice of the even layers .",
    "the hamiltonian of a system with an even number @xmath8 of layers can be rewritten in a block diagonal form , where the @xmath9 different blocks are bilayer - like hamiltonians .",
    "the blocks can be linked by hopping parameters that couple lattice sites on next - nearest planes . for an odd number ( @xmath10 ) of layers ,",
    "one of the blocks is the monolayer hamiltonian .",
    "therefore , these systems have a linear band in addition to the @xmath9 parabolic ones.@xcite    -trilayer graphene . ]    in @xmath0 stacked multilayer graphene , the @xmath6 sublattice of each layer lies opposite to the @xmath7 sublattice of the layer above it , but opposite to the honeycomb centers in the layer beneath it ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . since electrons that are placed oppositely in two bordering planes dimerize , resulting in an energy shift away from zero ,",
    "these multilayers can , for low energies , be described by a @xmath11 effective matrix hamiltonian , which is governed by the indirect ( effective ) hopping between the two atoms in the outer planes that have no neighbor in the adjacent layer .",
    "this effective hopping is a process consisting of @xmath12 interplane nearest - neighbor hoppings , combined with @xmath9 in - plane nearest - neighbor hoppings , resulting in an energy dispersion around the @xmath13-points , @xmath14.@xcite    a tight - binding approach for an increasing number of layers should in principle include hopping between more distant carbon atoms .",
    "the long known slonczewski - weiss - mcclure ( swmc ) model@xcite accounts for next - nearest - neighbor hopping , as well as hopping between next - nearest planes .",
    "in fact , trilayer graphene can be used to obtain the values of the different hopping parameters by fitting experimental data to the swmc model.@xcite however , often it is sufficient to take into account only the intra- and interplane nearest - neighbor hopping parameters .",
    "recent experimental and theoretical studies of trilayer graphene have shown that magnetotransport and electronic transport properties,@xcite thermoelectric transport properties@xcite , and chiral tunneling@xcite indeed depend on the stacking order .",
    "furthermore , one can open a sizeable bandgap in @xmath0-stacked trilayers ( @xmath15 mev ) by applying an external electric field , while for an @xmath3-trilayer no gap is observed under the same conditions.@xcite    extensive research into the band structure of @xmath0-multilayer graphene has been done recently using an effective mass approximation.@xcite it was found that the electron and hole bands touching at zero energy support chiral quasiparticles characterized by a berry phase of @xmath16 for @xmath9 layers .",
    "the phonon spectrum of @xmath0-stacked graphene has been investigated theoretically using density functional theory@xcite and experimentally by using infrared absorption spectroscopy , where the intensities have been found to be much stronger than that of bilayer graphene.@xcite using magnetic fields up to 60 t , there has been evidence of the integer quantum hall effect in trilayer graphene.@xcite the hall resistivity plateaus have been reproduced by using a self - consistent hartree calculation on @xmath0-stacked graphene.@xcite it has been suggested that the differences in the quantum hall effect between @xmath0- and @xmath3- stacking might be used to identify the stacking order of high - quality trilayer samples.@xcite by using infrared absorption spectroscopy , it has been shown that the optical conductivity spectra for @xmath0- and @xmath3- stacked graphene differs considerably.@xcite these optical properties have been calculated and reproduced in the framework of a tight - binding model.@xcite finally , it can be mentioned that high - resolution transmission microscopy of @xmath0-stacked trilayer graphene on a sic surface has successfully provided information on the interlayer distances of @xmath0-trilayer graphene.@xcite    in this article we investigate the magnetic properties of @xmath0-trilayer graphene by using a nearest - neighbor tight - binding model , in the presence of long - range coulomb interactions . for interacting electrons ,",
    "the system can gain energy by aligning the spins of the electrons .",
    "this _ exchange mechanism _ is accompanied by a cost in kinetic energy due to the pauli principle .",
    "after fixing the doping level and interaction strength , one can use a variational approach to determine whether the system spontaneously magnetizes or remains paramagnetic .",
    "for monolayer graphene , the system only magnetizes if the interaction strength is tuned to unphysically high values . depending on the doping level @xmath2",
    ", this phase transition can be first or second order.@xcite for bilayer graphene the system can be ferromagnetic for the estimated value of the coulomb interaction ( @xmath17 ) , but the electron density has to be as low as @xmath18 @xmath19 for the material to become magnetic.@xcite this is on the brink of what is experimentally achievable , since it is not possible to create perfectly undoped graphene in experiment , due to the formation of electron hole puddles@xcite and impurities trapped in the substrate . in @xmath3-trilayer ,",
    "the interplay between the linear and the parabolic bands opens up possibilities for both spin,- and band - ferromagnetism , but only at low electron doping.@xcite    -trilayer graphene ( two lowest bands ) .",

    "here we show that this is indeed the case : although the screening reduces the regime of parameters for the occurrence of ferromagnetism , the latter remains at least one order of magnitude more robust than in unscreened bilayer graphene .",

    "a thorough calculation of the polarization bubble in the full - band model is beyond the scope of this paper , and will be deferred to a future publication.@xcite nevertheless , we have included screening effects within a simplified model . in the case of monolayer and bilayer graphene ,",
    "the large-@xmath97 behavior of the bubble diagrams are linear in @xmath97 , with the same slope @xmath192 . arguing that this linear behavior also applies to @xmath0-trilayer graphene , and approximating the low-@xmath97 behavior of the polarization by a constant",
    ", we found that screening effects can be incorporated via a simple renormalization of the electron - electron coupling @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows that the large momentum behavior of the screening leads to a reduced ferromagnetic region in the @xmath0-trilayer graphene phase diagram . however , ferromagnetism is still approximately 25 times stronger than in unscreened bilayer graphene , which means that @xmath0-trilayer remains the material with the strongest ferromagnetic behavior .",
    "we are aware that next - nearest neighbor hopping parameters , like @xmath193 of the swmc model can be of the same order as @xmath194,@xcite and that this can have an influence on the low - momentum behavior of the model .",
    "this parameter has been systematically neglected in studies of ferromagnetism in multilayer graphene ( see ref .   for bilayer and ref .   for @xmath3-trilayer ) .",
    "the reason is that , for studying the effects of other hopping parameters , one needs to redefine what is meant by a particle and a hole pocket due to the broken rotational symmetry of the dispersion around the k - point of the brillouin zone , resulting from the swmc model.@xcite furthermore , this broken symmetry leads to more complex integration boundaries , which makes the resulting numerical integrations intractable .",
    "recently , an intrinsic bandgap of @xmath195 mev was experimentally observed in suspended @xmath0-trilayer graphene , and it was argued that it should be driven by interactions.@xcite however , this gap did not appear in most of the samples placed on a substrate , which were investigated during the same study .",
    "since suspended samples are more susceptible to ripples and deformations , it can well be that the spatial inversion symmetry was broken by strain , resulting in the intrinsic bandgap .",
    "our studies should then apply for @xmath0-trilayer graphene on a substrate , without deformations .",
    "because the dielectric constant is larger for samples on a substrate than for suspended samples ( in vacuum ) , the coupling constant @xmath1 will be renormalized by a factor @xmath196 for graphene on a sio@xmath197 wafer .",
    "otherwise , the paramagnetic - ferromagnetic phase transition remains unaltered .",
    "a simplified theoretical model which includes only on - site interactions suggests that the difference in bandstructure between @xmath3- and @xmath0-stacked trilayers should be enough to explain the presence of a gap due to antiferromagnetism in @xmath0 samples , while @xmath3-stacked trilayers remain ungapped.@xcite these studies , however , can not explain why the gap arises only in suspended samples .    here",
    "we include long - range coulomb interactions and investigate also the effect of screening .",
    "it is usually argued ( without further ado ) that screening is more important in @xmath0-trilayer than in the other related compunds .",
    "our studies reveal that this is not always true , since the polarization is linearly increasing in a considerable region , over which one must integrate to obtain the exchange energy .",
    "this feature is similar in monolayer , bilayer , and @xmath0- trilayer graphene , and it is simply a consequence of the linear dispersion at intermediate values of @xmath97 , which occurs in all the cases .",
    "our studies reveal that the low energy approximation for the polarization is not always enough to ground fast conclusions .",
    "although the final understanding about @xmath0-trilayer graphene has not yet been reached , we hope that our work will pave the way to possible extensions of the existing models for the investigation of ferromagnetism in multi - layer graphene using numerical methods . +   +",

    "the interaction hamiltonian for @xmath0-trilayer graphene is shown in eq .",

    "fourier transforming @xmath198 and @xmath199 leads to @xmath200 in the discrete limit . using eq .",

    "( [ intrealsp ] ) , going to the discrete limit , and subsequently rewriting the resulting expression into a matrix form yields @xmath201 where ( by omitting the @xmath202 dependence for brevity ) @xmath203 the matrix @xmath204 is diagonalized by @xmath205 such that @xmath206 where @xmath207 with @xmath208 , @xmath209 and @xmath210 .",
    "similarly , @xmath211 is diagonalized by @xmath212 such that @xmath213 where @xmath214 let us define @xmath215 using the above diagonalizations yields      by defining @xmath217 @xmath218 the hamiltonian reduces to the compact form @xmath219 inspection of the operators @xmath220 for @xmath221 , indicates that they are all linear combinations of @xmath222 for @xmath223 .",

    "then , to first order , the energy of the system is described by @xmath237 where @xmath238 denotes normal ordering .",
    "working out the expectation value of @xmath31 results in two distinct contributions .",
