    "another possibility is that the observed power law may not be the direct nuclear source , but only an indirect scattered component .",

    "a nearby source @xmath36 away in the sis1 and gis detectors complicated the measurement of count rates .",
    "we searched the palomar optical sky survey for an optical counterpart to this nearby source , but none was apparent .",
    "the confusing source was quite faint in sis1 , and the lack of its detection in sis0 can be understood as resulting from the different position of each detector with respect to the optical axis of the telescope . for gis2 ,",
    "the count rate upper limit for pg  1011040  in table  2 is @xmath37/@xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of counts in the source cell and @xmath38 is the exposure time .",
    "counts from the nearby source mentioned above were excluded .",
    "we have investigated potential variability between the 350  s  all - sky survey observation and our  exposure .",
    "although the constraints are not tight , we do not find highly significant evidence for variability .",
    "pg  1535 + 547  was clearly detected in all four detectors with enough total counts , @xmath40 , for spectral analysis .",
    "the source spectra were extracted using circular source cells with radii @xmath41/@xmath42 for the sis / gis to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , and the background regions were extracted as described in @xmath432.1 .",
    "the following spectral analysis was also done using different background regions on the ccds for the sis as well as source - free background regions on the gis .",
    "the results were consistent and thus are not sensitive to the choice of background region .    for the first fit to the data in all four detectors , a power law with fixed galactic absorption",
    "the resulting photon index , @xmath44 , is abnormally flat for a typical type  1 agn .",
    "in addition , the residuals showed a systematic excess below 1  kev indicating that the fit was poor .",
    "a @xmath45 of 134.7 for 119 degrees of freedom was obtained indicating that this model can be rejected with 84% confidence according to the @xmath46 probability distribution as defined in @xmath47 of bevington & robinson ( 1992 ; see table  3 ) .",
    "next , we fit a power law with fixed galactic absorption also allowing for the presence of intrinsic absorption .",
    "the fitted photon index was again low , @xmath48 , with negligible intrinsic absorption and @xmath45=134.7 for 118 degrees of freedom ; this model can be rejected with 86% confidence .",
    "a plot of the residuals again showed an excess below 1  kev . forcing the photon index to lie in the typical range for radio - quiet agn , @xmath491.52.5 , only worsened the fit .",
    "finally , we fit a model adding intrinsic neutral absorption partially covering the incident power law .",
    "the choice of this model was motivated by the presence of low energy photons which would be completely absorbed by total coverage of the emission source by neutral gas .",
    "an effective partial covering situation could result from two lines - of - sight to the source of the x - ray emission . in this scenario ,",
    "the first component would be direct emission absorbed by gas along the line - of - sight , and the second component would be unabsorbed emission scattered by electrons towards the observer . since scattering results in an increased fraction of polarized flux , the high observed optical polarization of pg  1535 + 547  suggests that scattering is indeed occurring in the nucleus . for the partial covering model , the resulting best - fitting model parameters were an intrinsic neutral absorption column density of @xmath50  @xmath3 , a covering fraction of @xmath51% , and @xmath52 ( see figure  4 ) .",
    "the @xmath45 was 117.5 for 117 degrees of freedom , a significant improvement over all of the previous fits at the 99% confidence level according to the @xmath53-test .",
    "the residuals showed no obvious trends , and the partial covering model explains the additional soft photons evident in the simple absorption models while also providing a physically reasonable photon index .",
    "confidence contour plots for the two partial covering parameters are displayed in figure  5 . from this best - fitting model to the  data , we obtain @xmath27=10@xmath54  erg  s@xmath17 ( absorption - corrected @xmath27=10@xmath55  erg  s@xmath17 ) . for completeness , we also tried an ionized absorber model , but the fit left clear systematic residuals .",
    "the partial - covering absorption model was preferable , with @xmath56 for the same number of degrees of freedom .    according to the  data ,",

    "this dramatic change corresponds to a factor of @xmath59 increase in flux for a fixed x - ray spectral shape .",
    "however , a closer look at the pspc data indicates that pg  1535 + 547  was not actually detected in the 0.52.0  kev band but only in the 0.10.5  kev band . in the 0.52.0  kev band",
    ", there were 5 photons in the @xmath60 radius source cell with 2 expected from the background . using the method of kraft , burrows & nousek ( 1991 ) , the upper limit on",
    "the number of counts from the target is 8.54 at the 95% confidence level .",
    "this corresponds to an observed count rate of @xmath61  ct  s@xmath17 . to estimate @xmath6",

    "1997 for discussion ) and then found the normalization that gave the proper count rate for the entire 0.12.5  kev band . if instead the 0.52.0  kev count rate upper limit is used to estimate an upper limit on the 2  kev flux density , then @xmath6  is measured to be @xmath64",
    ". the lower limit on the flux increase for a fixed spectral shape is then a factor of 2.4 .",
    "though the limited photon statistics in the  observation preclude spectral analysis , we can still compare the two observations in order to determine if the increase in @xmath6  is greater than expected from measurement and systematic errors .",
    "we took the best - fitting  sis0 spectral model and convolved it with the  pspc response using xspec . from this",
    ", we predicted a pspc count rate of @xmath65  ct  s@xmath17 in the 0.52.0 kev band ( errors are for 90% confidence ) , clearly above the measured upper limit .",
    "though the absolute calibrations of the two satellites have a systematic offset , measured fluxes in the 0.52.0 kev band are generally consistent within errors @xcite ; this can not account for the increase in brightness .",
    "the source has varied significantly in the six years between the two observations .      in all four  instruments ,",
    "pg  2112 + 059  was clearly detected with enough counts , a total of @xmath66 , for spectral analysis .",
    "source spectra were extracted as described above using circular source cells with radii @xmath67/@xmath68 arcmin for the sis / gis .",
    "the gis source cell was chosen slightly smaller than in @xmath432.2 in order to avoid including photons from a faint source located @xmath69 from the target .",
    "background spectra were also extracted as described in @xmath432.1 , and we have verified that our results below are not sensitive to the details of the background subtraction .",
    "for the first fit to the data in all four detectors , a power law with fixed galactic absorption was used .",
    "a @xmath45 of 182.8 for 151 degrees of freedom was obtained indicating that this model can be rejected with 96% confidence .",
    "the resulting photon index , @xmath70 , is rather flat for a typical qso .",
    "in addition , the residuals showed a systematic deficit below 1  kev which also indicated that the fit was not good in the soft band and suggested the presence of intrinsic absorption .",
    "in order to model only the continuum , we excluded the data below 3  kev in the rest frame ( 2 kev in the observed frame ) . above 3 kev ,",
    "the absorption of incident photons by neutral or partially ionized gas should be much less than in the softer band , thus allowing the underlying power - law continuum to be observed and fit directly .",
    "these data were then fit with a power law plus galactic absorption .",
    "this resulted in a steeper photon index of @xmath71 , more characteristic of radio - quiet qsos , and @xmath45=69.0 for 76 degrees of freedom .",
    "the data below 3  kev were then included , and the model extrapolated to the lowest  energy bins ( 0.87 kev rest frame ) .",
    "the resulting plot , shown in figure  6 , is suggestive of the possible nature of the intrinsic absorber .",
    "the spectra appear to recover towards the power - law continuum in the lowest energy bins , hinting at either partially ionized absorbing gas or partial covering of the continuum .",
    "in contrast , a neutral , cold absorber would depress almost all flux below @xmath72  kev , the energy where the continuum recovers .",
    "we fit several models to try to characterize the absorbing gas .",
    "the details of each fit are listed in table  3 .",
    "briefly , intrinsic absorption by neutral gas with column density @xmath73  @xmath3 was preferable at the @xmath74% confidence level to a straight power law with only galactic absorption according to the @xmath53-test ( @xmath75 ) .",
    "in addition , adding neutral intrinsic absorption resulted in a photon index of @xmath76 which is consistent with @xmath77 for the fit to the data above 3  kev in the rest frame ( see figure  7 ) .",
    "fitting the data with a warm absorber or a partial covering model also yielded acceptable fits to the data ; however , the fits were not statistically significant improvements over that with a neutral absorber ( see table 3 ) .",
    "an iron k@xmath18 line is not detected ; we can set an upper limit on the ew of a narrow line from 6.46.97  kev of @xmath78  ev .",
    "pg  2112 + 059  is a luminous x - ray source with @xmath79 and @xmath80  erg  s@xmath17 , and so any possible starburst x - ray contribution would negligibly influence our spectral fitting . though absorption of one form or another is certainly required , these data do not have a high enough signal - to - noise ratio to distinguish between various absorption models .",
    "regardless of the nature of the absorber , the photon index is consistently @xmath81 , completely typical for a radio - quiet qso .",
    "we have investigated the impact of the changing sis calibration on the results of our spectral - fitting ( t. yaqoob 1999 , private communication ) and find that our general conclusions are not substantively affected .    the archival  pspc data from a 21.1 ks observation on 1991 november 15 can not be simultaneously fit with the  data without allowing the power - law normalization to drop by a factor of @xmath82 .",
    "if we convolve the  sis0 model with the  pspc response , then the predicted 0.52.0  kev count rate for the  observation is @xmath83  ct  s@xmath17 .",
    "this value is almost a factor of four larger than the observed pspc count rate in the same band of @xmath84  ct  s@xmath17 .",
    "the  data have a low signal - to - noise ratio , but spectral analysis allows for a measurement of the 2  kev flux density which is relatively insensitive to the specific model .",
    "recalculating @xmath6  more robustly from spectral fitting of the data ( rather than assuming a model and using the pspc count rate as in blw ) , one obtains @xmath6@xmath85 , similar to the blw value of @xmath86 .",
    "the measured @xmath6@xmath87 from the best - fitting  data is significantly higher than any @xmath6  consistent with the  data ; @xmath58@xmath6  of 0.32 between the two observations corresponds to an increase in the rest - frame 2  kev flux density by a factor of @xmath88 .",
    "the discrepancy between the relative increases in the 2  kev flux density and the observed versus predicted pspc count rates can be reconciled if the x - ray spectral shape has varied , perhaps due to changes in the absorbing material along the line - of - sight . for example",
    ", a change in ionization state of the material along the line - of - sight could strongly affect the rest - frame 2  kev flux density but cause smaller changes to the observed frame 0.52.0  kev integrated flux .",
    "clearly , pg  2112 + 059  has brightened substantially in the soft x - ray band in the decade since the  observation .",
    "in fact , pg  2112 + 059  is no longer sxw as defined by blw .",
    "from our rudimentary spectral analysis , pg  1011040  appears to have a typical power - law x - ray continuum with no evidence for absorption beyond the galactic column density .",
    "forcing a normal underlying agn x - ray spectrum in addition to the observed component requires an intrinsic neutral column density of @xmath89  @xmath3 to extinguish it to the top of the  bandpass ; such a large column density would be extraordinary for a type  1 agn .",
    "detecting a narrow iron  k@xmath18 emission line with a large ew would provide evidence for such a situation , but we are unable to set meaningful constraints with the current data .",
    "given that the exact relationship between uv and x - ray absorbers is still unclear , such heavy absorption can perhaps be reconciled with the lack of detected c  iv absorption if the gas is dense and cold or very close to the nucleus .",
    "dense , cold gas can effectively absorb x - rays without creating strong absorption in the high - ionization c  iv line as can gas lying interior to the uv emission region .",
    "alternatively , this may be an intriguing example of an agn with intrinsically weak x - ray emission .",
    "however , the normal he  ii  @xmath904686 emission ( ew@xmath91  ; bg92 ) suggests that the intrinsic x - ray emission can not be extremely abnormal ( korista , ferland & baldwin 1997 ; blw )",
    ". a depressed ionizing continuum in the extreme uv ( euv ) would not produce significant he  ii emission , and it is difficult to reconcile a normal euv continuum with drastically reduced x - ray emission .",
    "regardless , pg  1011040  merits further study in both the x - ray and uv regions of the spectrum in order to more tightly constrain the apparent lack of absorption in both bands ( see figures  8 and 9 ) .",
    "in addition , uv emission line studies of this object are important for further investigating the intrinsically weak x - ray continuum scenario .",
    "the  data provide a measurement of @xmath6 consistent with that derived from the  pspc count rate , and so this source remains firmly in the sxw category . from archival  data , @xmath92 ( @xmath93 )",
    "was measured @xcite , indicating that this source has been consistently weak in soft x - rays for at least two decades .  data from 1993 and 1995",
    "show no evidence for uv variability .",
    "pg  1535 + 547  shows clear signs of intrinsic absorption by a large column density of gas ( @xmath94  @xmath3 ) with only partial covering of the power - law continuum .",
    "the partial covering model is particularly interesting with regard to the optical polarization properties of this agn since it implies possible electron scattering of x - rays around intrinsic absorbing clouds .",
    "this result is consistent with the known high polarization of the optical continuum flux ( @xmath19=28% ; smith et al .",
    "1997 ) and closely resembles the x - ray results for the sxw agn pg  1411 + 442  @xcite .",
    "pg  1411 + 442  has a comparable internal column density , @xmath95=@xmath96 @xmath3 , and covering fraction , @xmath97=@xmath98 . from the broad - band spectral energy distribution of pg  1535 + 547",
    "( see figure  8) , the reddened continuum in the optical and uv is clearly seen , as well as the recovery of the x - ray continuum to within the range expected given the 3000 flux density .",
    "the amount of reddening in the optical and uv , though significant , is still much less than the @xmath99 expected along the direct line - of - sight if the absorbing material has roughly a galactic dust - to - gas ratio @xcite .",
    "though dust may be responsible for the optical polarization , it is an inefficient scattering medium for x - rays ; electrons are the most likely candidates for x - ray scatterers .",
    "the increase in x - ray brightness of pg  1535 + 547  in the six years between the  and   observations is notable .",
    "determining whether the continuum flux has increased or the absorption has decreased is not possible given the limited  data . during the same epoch , the near - infrared flux of pg  1535 + 547  in 4 bands from 1.273.7  @xmath100 m also varied significantly , increasing by @xmath101 mag from 1993 to 1996 and then dropping by @xmath101 mag between 1996 and 1998 @xcite .",
    "our analysis of archival uv data from  indicates that on 1982 november 17 and 1984 may 7 , pg",
    "1535 + 547  was 30% brighter than in earlier  spectra ( 1982 june 6 and september 26 ) .",
    "later  spectra ( 1992",
    "september 19 ) are consistent with the earliest  data .      with this  observation ,",
    "pg  2112 + 059  is found to have the largest x - ray flux of any bal  qso known . for comparison ,",
    "the next brightest -observed bal  qso , phl 5200 , had broad - band count rates @xmath72 times lower in all detectors @xcite .",
    "our result of a typical qso x - ray continuum with absorption is robust .",
    "regardless of the nature of the absorbing gas , neutral , partially ionized or partially covering , the photon index is @xmath81 .",
    "this is the first direct spectral evidence for a typical qso x - ray continuum in a bal qso and supports the assumption that they are indeed normal qsos cloaked by absorbing gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our best - fitting model to the  data finds an intrinsic , neutral column density of @xmath102  @xmath3 .",
    "the data are not of sufficient quality to determine the ionization state of the gas ; ionized gas would require a larger column density for the same amount of continuum absorption .",
    "an additional issue complicating the determination of the line - of - sight column density is the unknown velocity dispersion of the gas .",
    "currently available models for x - ray absorption by neutral or partially ionized gas do not usually account for any velocity dispersion within the absorber .",
    "thus they are severely limited for the study of bal  qsos which may have velocity dispersions as large as @xmath103  km  s@xmath17 if the x - ray and uv absorbing gas have similar velocity structure . at these high dispersions ,",
    "bound - bound x - ray absorption becomes significant and may dominate over bound - free absorption ( see @xmath104 of netzer 1996 ; d. chelouche & h. netzer 2000 , private communication ) .",
    "the measured neutral column density for pg  2112 + 059  is more than an order of magnitude lower than the intrinsic column densities implied for the bal  qsos pg  0946 + 301 @xcite and pg  1700 + 518  ( gallagher et al .",
    "1999 ) , and it may be that this lower column density is related to the relatively shallow bal troughs of this object ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "future observations of a larger sample of bal  qsos can test if the depths in bal troughs are correlated with the observed x - ray column density , but care must be taken to evaluate the amount of scattering which can partially ` fill in ' bals .",
    "the measured column density also appears to be insufficient for the ` hitchhiking ' gas postulated by murray et al .",
    "( 1995 ) . in their model ,",
    "thick , highly ionized gas with @xmath105  @xmath3 absorbs soft x - rays and shields the bal wind from becoming completely stripped of electrons .",
    "the x - ray absorbing gas is stalled at the base of the flow and is distinct from the gas causing the broad uv absorption lines . though our data suggest that this is not the case for pg  2112 + 059 , higher spectral resolution observations are required to constrain the velocity of the x - ray absorbing gas .    from  data , tananbaum et al .",
    "( 1986 ) measured an upper limit of @xmath6  @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) which is weaker than the current value , but consistent with the  observations .",
    "since then , the variability of @xmath6 from @xmath108 to @xmath109 over the course of a decade makes further uv studies as well as higher signal - to - noise ratio x - ray observations of this source important .",
    "in particular , the demonstrated variability of pg  2112 + 059  in the x - rays can be compared with the uv bals .",
    "the probable x - ray spectral variability hints at changes in absorption structure , either of the ionization parameter or the column density .",
    "bal qsos generally have little variability in their uv absorption line profiles ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , if the uv and x - ray absorbing gas are closely related and the increase in x - ray flux is a result of changing absorption structure , then the dramatic change in @xmath6 should occur in concert with significant changes in the uv absorption lines .",
    "the gravitationally lensed qso pg  1115 + 080 is an example of a mini - bal qso which appears to show variable x - ray absorption @xcite as well as clear changes in uv absorption ( michalitsianos , oliversen & nichols 1996 ) .",
    "the archival  fos data of pg  2112 + 059  were taken in 1992 , approximately one year after the 1991  observation and seven years before this  observation .",
    "pg  2112 + 059  is scheduled for a possible cycle 9  observation as part of a uv absorption snapshot survey .    from the spectral energy distribution of pg  2112 + 059  ( see figure  8) , it is apparent that the  uv spectra are not continuous with the neugebauer et al .",
    "( 1987 ) uv photometric data points which we used to calculate @xmath6  in table  2 . in the @xmath110 years between the 1980 n87 measurements and the  fos observation ,",
    "it is likely that the uv / optical flux has diminished .",
    "optical variability is not unreasonable as between 1992 and 1996 , part of the time between the  and  observations , pg  2112 + 059  brightened by 0.18 mag in the @xmath111 band @xcite .",
    "additional photometric data up to the present epoch show continued variability of @xmath112 mag in @xmath111 ( garcia - rissmann et al .",
    ", in preparation ) .",
    "analysis of  and  data from 1986 to 1995 shows no evidence for uv continuum variability . if instead of using n87 values",
    "the  continuum data are extrapolated to rest - frame 3000  , the  and values for @xmath6  are @xmath113 and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "our  absorption - corrected @xmath6  is then @xmath115 , within @xmath116 of the mean of the laor et al .",
    "( 1997 ) radio - quiet agn distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "this is further evidence supporting the picture of bal  qsos as agn with typical underlying x - ray continua .",
    "since the strongest signatures of x - ray absorption are edges at fairly low energies (  2  kev ) , the characteristics of the x - ray absorbing gas are most readily studied in low - redshift objects where rest - frame photons below @xmath117  kev can still be detected with available x - ray instruments . with its high x - ray luminosity , @xmath79  erg  s@xmath17 ( absorption - corrected @xmath118  erg  s@xmath17 ) and @xmath80  erg  s@xmath17 ,",
    "pg  2112 + 059  is unlikely to suffer significant contamination by a nuclear starburst as the most x - ray luminous starburst galaxy known is more than 200 times fainter @xcite .",
    "two other relatively x - ray bright bal qsos , cso  755 ( @xmath119 ) and phl  5200 ( @xmath120 ) , are at much higher redshifts , and thus pg  2112 + 059  offers the most promise for detailed absorption studies with the new generation of x - ray observatories . with higher spectral resolution and greater sensitivity at low energies , parameters such as the ionization state and column density of the absorber can be probed more thoroughly . ideally , grating observations of this source have the potential to elucidate the dynamical structure of the x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "the number of sxw agn in blw with published  spectral constraints is now six out of ten : pg  0043 + 008 , pg  1011040 , pg  1411 + 442 , pg  1535 + 547 ,",
    "pg  1700 + 518 , and pg  2112 + 059 .",
    "as the number of sxw agn observed in the 210  kev band grows , the general identification of soft x - ray weakness with intrinsic x - ray absorption becomes more plausible .",
    "pg  1411 + 442  had been shown previously to have substantial x - ray absorption with a neutral column density of @xmath121  @xmath3 @xcite . with two of our sample ,",
    "pg  1535 + 547  and pg  2112 + 059 , we have also examined objects with more x - ray absorption than is typically seen in type  1 agn but still with enough photons for direct spectroscopic analysis .",
    "the bal qsos pg  0043 + 008 and pg  1700 + 518 were not detected by  which suggests that they suffer absorption by a column density larger than @xmath122  @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "pg  1011040  is the only object to show no evidence for strong uv or x - ray absorption .    with the exception of perhaps pg  1011040 , the sxw agn which have been spectroscopically studied in the hard band",
    "show no evidence for unusual intrinsic spectral energy distributions .",
    "in addition , the occurrence of uv and x - ray absorption is now one - to - one ; we have found evidence for x - ray absorption in those sources with detected uv absorption .",
    "these observations lend direct support to absorption as the primary cause for soft x - ray weakness as put forward by blw . after correcting the observed x - ray spectra of pg  1411 + 442 , pg  1535 + 547 , and pg  2112 + 059  for intrinsic absorption , one obtains photon indices and @xmath6  values consistent with typical type  1 agn .",
    "this serves to emphasize the universality of x - ray emission in qsos , and the value of @xmath6 as a parameter for identifying qsos with interesting uv and x - ray absorption properties .",
    "the three agn in this study and pg  1411 + 442  are ideal targets for higher throughput x - ray spectroscopy and additional uv observations .",
    "the most compelling issues to address remain the nature of the relationship between the x - ray and uv absorbers and the dynamics of the x - ray absorbing gas .",
    "since the bulk of the gas in the inner regions may be most readily observable in x - rays , it is essential to measure the velocity of this gas to determine the mass - outflow rates of agn .",
    "the @xmath6  variability of two sxw agn , pg  1535 + 547  and pg  2112 + 059 , suggests that other sources in the intermediate range ( @xmath123 ) may also vary and perhaps even join the ranks of sxw agn at times .",
    "one possible example of such interesting variability is pg 0844 + 349 which is generally not sxw , but in one out of five x - ray observations had an intermediate @xmath6  of @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ; wang et al . 2000 ) .",
    "additional 0.110.0  kev x - ray observations of the sources known to vary in @xmath6 are essential for determining whether the absorbing gas or the underlying continuum itself is changing .",
    "pg  2112 + 059  appears to be an example of a sxw agn whose spectral shape has changed over time most likely as a result of changing absorption structure ( see @xmath432.3 ) .",
    "simultaneous or near - simultaneous uv observations are also required to elucidate the precise relationship of the uv and x - ray absorbers and calculate @xmath6  consistently .",
    "currently , we have direct evidence for variability in x - ray flux which translates into horizontal motion in the blw c  iv absorption ew versus @xmath6  plot ( see figure  9 ) . as of yet , we do not have corresponding multi - epoch c  iv absorption ew measurements and can not determine if the plot is as dynamic vertically .",
    "though monitoring of uv bals by barlow ( 1993 ) showed little variability , the matter requires further investigation .",
    "if the variability is a result of bulk motions of absorbing clouds across the line - of - sight , then the agn currently towards the absorbed end of the correlation may show more dramatic changes over time as their clouds continue to move .",
    "all three of the sxw  agn studied above , and indeed all of the sxw  agn of blw , were originally selected by their blue optical color , and blw found no evidence for a systematic difference between the optical continuum slopes of sxw and non - sxw agn .",
    "thus , given our x - ray spectral fitting results , it appears that a non - negligible fraction of blue type  1 agn suffer significant x - ray absorption and have hard x - ray spectra qualitatively similar to that of the x - ray background .",
    "such objects need to be remembered when constructing agn synthesis models for the x - ray background , and indeed some blue qsos with hard x - ray spectra have been found in x - ray background surveys ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
