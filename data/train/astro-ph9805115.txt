    "the magnetic braking torque acting on an isolated neutron star would be steady in the absence of abrupt changes to the star s magnetic configuration .",
    "most pulsars , however , do not slow in a regular fashion , but suffer variations in their spin rates in the form of glitches and timing noise .",
    "perhaps the most striking aspect of spin evolution is the persistent increases in spin - down rate that accompany glitches in the crab pulsar ( @xcite ) , psr 0355 + 54 ( @xcite ) and psr 1830 - 08 ( @xcite ) ; see table 1 . in the crab , these permanent _ offsets _ involve fractional changes in the spin down rate of @xmath1 ( see fig .",
    "psr 1830 - 08 has exhibited one offset of @xmath2 , and a persistent offset might have followed the large 1986 glitch of psr 0355 + 54 .",
    "similar offsets might also occur in the vela pulsar ( @xcite ) , giving rise to the small braking index of @xmath3 reported by lyne  ( 1996 ) .",
    "it is striking that all observed offsets are of the same sign , and correspond to _ increases _ in the spin - down rate .",
    "one interpretation of this phenomenon is that glitches are accompanied by sudden and permanent increases in the external torque acting upon the star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "such torque changes could occur if either the direction or magnitude of the star s magnetic moment changes .",
    "_ starquakes _ , occurring as the star spins down ( @xcite ; @xcite ) would affect the external torque if they change the orientation of the magnetic moment with respect to the spin axis .",
    "if structural relaxation occurs asymmetrically about the rotation axis , due perhaps to magnetic stresses or asymmetric material properties , the star s spin and angular momentum vectors would become misaligned .",
    "as the star precesses and relaxes to a new rotational state , the magnetic moment would assume a new orientation with respect to the rotation axis , leading to a change in the external torque . in this paper",
    ", we study how the rigid neutron star crust relaxes its structure , and consider possible consequences for evolution of the magnetic field and torque .",
    "alpar and pines ( 1993 ; also @xcite ) have suggested that the crab s offsets result from a reduction in the moment of inertia on which the external torque acts .",
    "such a change could occur by either a structural change of the star , , the star becomes less oblate , or through a decoupling of a portion of the star s liquid interior from the external torque .",
    "if the moment of inertia decreases through structural readjustment , to conserve angular momentum , the star would always spin _ more _ rapidly than had the glitch not occurred ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the large offsets following the 1975 and 1989 glitches in the crab , however , eventually caused the star to spin _ less _ rapidly than had the glitch not occurred ( @xcite ) ; the observed offsets , therefore , can not be due _ solely _ to structural readjustments . in principle",
    ", the crab s spin - down rate offsets could be due to decoupling of a portion of the star s superfluid interior from the external torque ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , though quantitative agreement of this model with the data has yet to be demonstrated .",
    "torque increases associated with the surface field structure appears to be the most straightforward explanation .",
    "a neutron star relaxes its oblateness as it spins down , moving equatorial material toward the rotation axis and reducing the equatorial circumference .",
    "if the stellar crust is brittle , stresses lead to _ starquakes _ as the yield strength of the crustal material is exceeded ( @xcite ) .",
    "the actual response of solid neutron - star matter at high pressure to shear is not well - understood .",
    "here we assume that the neutron star crust is brittle and explore the consequences of this assumption .",
    "to study the qualitative features of the growth of strain in a neutron star as it spins - down under its external torque , we model the star as an incompressible , homogeneous , self - gravitating elastic sphere of constant shear modulus .",
    "the non - rotating configuration is a sphere of radius @xmath4 .",
    "we take the initial configuration to be unstrained with rotation frequency @xmath5 , and investigate how the star deforms as the spin rate changes by @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the initial rotation produces an equatorial bulge of relative height @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the keplerian velocity near the stellar surface .",
    "a change @xmath6 in the rotation rate produces a small decrease in the equatorial bulge of @xmath10 . as the star deforms ,",
    "matter originally at @xmath11 is displaced to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the _ displacement field_. the displacement field can be found using elasticity theory ( see , , @xcite ; @xcite ) . in a spherical coordinate system centered on the star , with @xmath14 at the star s north pole , the displacement field is ( see , also , @xcite ) @xmath15 here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are in units of the stellar radius , and we have neglected terms of order @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the transverse sound speed . the displacement field is illustrated in fig .",
    "the local distortion of the solid is described by the strain tensor @xmath20 in a local coordinate system in which this matrix is diagonal , the eigenvalues @xmath21 represent compression ( @xmath22 ) or dilation ( @xmath23 ) along the respective axes .",
    "suppose the largest and smallest eigenvalues are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the _ strain angle _ is @xmath26 , and the plane containing the corresponding principal axes is the _ stress plane_. for the uniform sphere , we find that the stress plane is tangential to the stellar surface near the equator with compression in the azimuthal direction and dilation toward the rotational poles ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . near the poles",
    ", the stress plane switches to the radial - azimuthal plane , , along cones .",
    "these results are consistent with those of baym and pines ( 1971 ) , who calculated the strain field as a sphere at zero pressure spins down .",
    "at zero pressure , a stressed element of matter can break due to shear or tension . at the pressure of the neutron star crust ( @xmath27 ) , however , only the former process can occur .",
    "compressed material strained at a critical angle shears along a plane as shown in fig . 4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the angle this plane takes with respect to the plane of maximum compression depends on the material s internal friction , and is in the range @xmath28 .",
    "the critical strain angle of neutron star material is not accurately known .",
    "highly - compressed terrestrial minerals can support strain angles of @xmath29 before breaking ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the geometry of a starquake is independent of the value of the critical strain angle for neutron star matter .",
    "strain builds as the star slows and reduces its circumference . for the homogeneous sphere",
    ", the maximum strain is reached on the equator , as each material element is compressed by its neighbors on the equator ( see fig .",
    "when the strain angle for an element reaches a critical value , the material breaks along a fault that takes an angle of @xmath28 with respect to the equator and propagates to higher latitudes ( see fig . 5 ) .",
    "movement of material from the equatorial bulge to higher latitudes decreases the star s oblateness . at higher latitudes the strain angle diminishes and the fault terminates ( @xcite ) .",
    "this picture of starquakes differs fundamentally from that of baym & pines ( 1971 ) who considered the distortion in a sphere at zero pressure .",
    "they found that the material breaks as tensile forces pull apart material in the equatorial plane . in our analysis , however , the enormous pressure in neutron star matter prevents tensile rupturing .",
    "for an axially - symmetric star , the crust is equally likely to begin breaking at every point on the equator .",
    "the rotation - induced displacements of the star s crust distort the initial magnetic field @xmath30 that is anchored in the stellar crust thus generating magnetic stresses that affect the development of strain .",
    "the strength of the magnetic stress relative to the shear stress is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the alfvn velocity . through most of the crust",
    "the induced magnetic stresses are significantly smaller than the material shear stresses and can be treated perturbatively .",
    "for example , at moderate densities in the outer crust we have @xmath33 , while the magnetic stresses can exceed the material ones at low densities , below @xmath34 .",
    "the strain field that develops in magnetized material could be obtained by solving the elasticity equations and maxwell s equations self - consistently , subject to boundary conditions at the star s surface . to illustrate how the star s magnetic field determines where starquakes originate , we consider the simpler problem of how the presence of a magnetic field affects the material strain in an infinite medium . in the absence of the field ,",
    "the equilibrium state is given by @xmath35 where @xmath36 represents gravitational and centrifugal forces .",
    "in the presence of a magnetic field , the stress tensor changes by @xmath37 . the displacement of the material induces a change in the field @xmath38 , with a corresponding change in the maxwell stress tensor @xmath39 of @xmath40 .",
    "we take the unperturbed field @xmath41 to be dipolar , which gives no force on the undistorted matter , , @xmath42 .",
    "the new equilibrium is given by @xmath43 for an infinite medium ( one in which boundary effects are unimportant ) , the solution is @xmath44 .",
    "the magnetic field induces a change @xmath45 in the displacement field . for a field that is sufficiently small that this correction to the displacement field is small , the perturbation to the maxwell stress tensor is @xmath46,\\ ] ] with @xmath47 here @xmath48 is the displacement field in the absence of the field . for incompressible matter , the correction @xmath49 to the strain tensor is @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the shear modulus .",
    "the eigenvalues of this tensor give the correction to the strain angle due to the induced magnetic forces .",
    "using the displacement field of eq . [ 1 ] in eq . [ 6 ]",
    ", we obtain an estimate of the corrections to the strain angle on the star s equator ; the result is shown in fig .",
    "6 . near the magnetic poles ,",
    "the field gives the material extra rigidity , and reduces the strain angle .",
    "consequently , as the star spins down , the strain increases the fastest at the two equatorial points farthest from the poles .",
    "these results indicate that a starquake will begin at one of these two points when critical strain is reached .",
    "a more complete treatment would account for magnetic stresses at the stellar surface ; we do not expect treatment of the boundary to alter our qualitative conclusions .",
    "isotropic material under compressive stress is as likely to break along the plane indicated in fig .",
    "4 as along its complementary plane . in a neutron star",
    ", however , the magnetic field gives the material extra rigidity along shear planes that cross field lines .",
    "cracking is thus favored along the plane that is most parallel to the field ( fault @xmath52 in fig .",
    "in the picture of starquakes described above , a slowing star reduces its equatorial circumference by shearing material across the equator , moving the material along the fault to higher latitudes ( see fig .",
    "we now discuss how this crustal motion could affect the spin - down torque acting on the star by producing a misalignment of the star s spin and angular momentum vectors .",
    "the star then undergoes damped precession to a new rotational state .",
    ", however , is only @xmath53 , too small to account for the largest persistent shifts seen in the crab . ]",
    "quake - induced mass motion produces a small change in the orientation of the principal axes of the star s moment of inertia .",
    "the material motions create `` mountains '' ( @xmath54 @xmath51 m high ) at higher latitudes , breaking the axial symmetry of the star s mass distribution .",
    "suppose that before the starquake the largest principal moment of inertia corresponds to a principal axis aligned with the rotation axis .",
    "as the mass motion occurs , the principal axis of inertia shifts _ away _ from the magnetic axis by @xmath55 , pointing in a new direction @xmath56 ( fixed in the star , see fig .",
    "the star s rotation and angular momentum vectors are now misaligned and the rotation axis precesses about the angular momentum axis ( @xcite ) .",
    "dissipative processes , such as the interaction of superfluid vortices with the nuclei of the inner crust , damp the precessional motion ( @xcite ) , bringing the star to a new stable equilibrium in which the principal axis of inertia is again aligned with the star s angular momentum . as the precessions damps , the angle between the star s rotation and magnetic axes @xmath0 _ increases _ by @xmath55 . in some models of pulsar spin",
    "down , an increase in @xmath0 leads to an increase in the spin - down torque . in the magnetic dipole model for pulsar slowdown , for example , an increase by @xmath55",
    "gives a _ permanent _ increase in the spin - down rate of @xmath57 .",
    "we suggest that the crab s offsets arise from starquake - induced changes of order @xmath58 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the following dimensional argument gives an estimate of the magnitude of the shift of the principal axes .",
    "suppose that between starquakes the star spins down by @xmath59 and reduces its equatorial circumference by @xmath60 . as the starquake occurs , crust material suddenly moves along the fault by a comparable amount . from eq .",
    "[ [ u ] ] , we estimate @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the time interval between large quakes and @xmath63 is the spin - down age . assuming that quakes are coincident with glitches , @xmath64 yr for the crab pulsar .",
    "matter accumulates in mountains over a length scale of lateral extent comparable to the fault length @xmath65 .",
    "we expect @xmath65 to be roughly the length scale characterizing the strain field , of order @xmath4 . upon formation of mountains ,",
    "@xmath66 changes its angle with respect to the rotation axis by an amount of order the ratio of the off - diagonal elements of the moment of inertia tensor to the bulge moment of inertia ; the shift is of order @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the mass of a mountain and @xmath69 is the mass in the equatorial bulge .",
    "the mass in the bulge is of order @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the mass of the crust .",
    "the fraction of crust mass that accumulates in a mountain is roughly the fraction of the star s area that moves with the fault , , @xmath72 .",
    "hence , we obtain an upper limit of @xmath73 for the crab pulsar , rankin ( 1990 ) obtains @xmath74 from radio data , and yadigaroglu & romani ( 1995 ) find @xmath75 from their analysis of gamma - ray and radio data . the corresponding fractional change in spin - down rate ( = @xmath76 ) is @xmath77 for @xmath75 , large enough to explain the observed persistent shifts ; @xmath74 gives a limit of @xmath78 .",
    "we can not yet apply eq .",
    "[ [ delta - a ] ] to psrs 0355 + 54 and 1830 - 08 ; only one large glitch has been observed in each of these pulsars , so the quake intervals and typical offset magnitudes are unknown .",
    "moreover , the magnitude of the permanent offset in psr 0355 + 54 , if any , is unknown since the spin - down rate has continued to changed following the large glitch of 1986 .",
    "the persistent increases in spin - down rate ( _ offsets _ ) seen to accompany glitches in the crab and other pulsars suggest sudden increases in the spin - down torque .",
    "starquakes occurring as a neutron star spins - down and readjusts its structure affect the spin - down torque exerted on the star by changing the magnetic field geometry or orientation . in this paper",
    "we have examined the evolution of strain in the crust of a spinning - down neutron star and the initiation of starquakes as the material reaches critical strain .",
    "crust cracking occurs as equatorial material shears under the compressive forces arising from the star s decreasing circumference .",
    "the star decreases its oblateness as matter is moved to higher latitudes along a fault inclined to the equator .",
    "magnetic stresses suppress shearing near the magnetic poles , especially shearing motions across the field lines .",
    "starquakes are thus most likely to originate near the two points on the equator farthest from the magnetic poles and propagate toward the magnetic poles .",
    "starquake - induced misalignment of the star s angular momentum and spin , associated with glitches , is a possible explanation for the spin - down offsets seen in the crab pulsar .",
