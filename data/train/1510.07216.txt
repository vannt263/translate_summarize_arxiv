    "gkm manifolds ( or more general spaces ) are -roughly- spaces with torus action whose 0- and 1-dimensional orbits have the structure of a graph .",
    "this class of spaces was first appeared in the work of goresky - kottwitz - macpherson @xcite as a class of algebraic varieties ( gkm stands for their initials ) .",
    "motivated by their works , guillemin - zara @xcite introduce a combinatorial counterpart of gkm manifold , called a(n ) ( abstract ) gkm graph , and give some dictionary between the ( symplectic ) geometry ( and topology ) of gkm manifolds and the combinatorics of gkm graphs .",
    "this leads us to the study of geometric and topological properties of gkm manifolds using combinatorial properties of gkm graphs ( see e.g. @xcite etc ) . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new invariant of gkm graphs and provide a partial answer to the extension problem of torus actions on gkm manifolds .",
    "to state our problem and main results more precisely , we briefly recall the setting of this paper and background of the problem .",
    "let @xmath6 be a @xmath5-dimensional , compact , connected , almost complex manifold with effective @xmath8-action , which preserves the almost complex structure , where @xmath8 is the @xmath7-dimensional torus .",
    "we denote such manifold as @xmath16 , or @xmath6 , @xmath1 , @xmath17 ( if its torus action or dimensions of manifold and torus are obviously known from the context ) .",
    "we call @xmath16 a _ gkm manifold _ if it satisfies the following properties ( see section  [ sect:4 ] for details ) :    1 .",
    "the set of fixed points is not empty , i.e. , @xmath18 ; 2 .",
    "the closure of a connected component of the set of one - dimensional orbits is equivariantly diffeomorphic to the @xmath13-dimensional sphere , called an _ invariant @xmath13-sphere_.    it easily follows from this setting that @xmath19 is always isolated , i.e. , 0-dimensional .",
    "therefore , regarding fixed points as vertices and invariant @xmath13-spheres as edges , this condition is equivalent to that the one - skeleton of @xmath16 has the structure of a graph , where a _",
    "one - skeleton _ of @xmath16 is the orbit space of the set of 0- and 1-dimensional orbits .",
    "note that there are several definitions of gkm manifolds .",
    "this is because the spaces with such torus actions , i.e. , their one - skeleton is a graph , are widely appeared in the spaces with torus actions , and such spaces have been studied from several different points of views ( homotopically , topologically , algebraically or geometrically ) . in this paper",
    ", we study the gkm manifolds defined by guillemin - zara in the paper @xcite .",
    "for example , in our setting , the following manifolds are gkm manifolds : non - singular complete toric varieties ( also called toric manifolds ) and homogeneous manifolds @xmath20 ( where @xmath21 is a compact connected lie group and @xmath22 is its closed subgroup with the same maximal torus ) with torus invariant almost complex structures such as @xmath23 , flag manifolds and complex grassmannians , etc .    because gkm manifolds are even - dimensional and their effective torus actions have isolated fixed points , the differentiable slice theorem tells us that the following inequality holds for every gkm manifold @xmath17 : @xmath24 if the equality @xmath25 holds , such a gkm manifold is also known as a _ torus manifold _",
    "( with invariant almost complex structure ) ; famous examples are toric manifolds .",
    "namely , the torus action on a torus manifold is ( automatically ) the maximal torus action . in this case",
    ", the author , masuda and wiemeler @xcite study the extended @xmath21-actions of @xmath0-actions on torus manifolds , where @xmath21 is a non - abelian , compact , simply connected lie group with the maximal torus @xmath0 .",
    "however , for the general gkm manifolds , the given torus action might not be the maximal torus action .",
    "in fact , a restricted @xmath26-action of a @xmath5-dimensional toric manifold @xmath27 is often a gkm manifold @xmath28 , in other words , this gkm manifold @xmath28 extends to a toric manifold @xmath27 .",
    "thus the following problem naturally arises in the gkm manifolds ( see also proposition  [ ext - cat - in - gkm ] ) :    [ prob ] when does a gkm manifold @xmath9 extend to a gkm manifold @xmath29 ?",
    "here , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .    to give an answer to this problem",
    ", we introduce a free abelian group with finite rank @xmath2 , called a _ group of axial functions _ , for the gkm graph @xmath4 in section  [ sect:2 ] . here , a _ gkm graph _ is -roughly- the following triple ( see section  [ sect:2 ] for details ) : an @xmath32-valent graph @xmath33 ; a function @xmath34 , called an _ axial function _ ; and a collection @xmath35 of some bijective maps between out - going edges on adjacent vertices , called a _",
    "connection_. we call such gkm graph an _ @xmath3-type _ gkm graph in this paper .",
    "note that a gkm manifold @xmath9 defines an @xmath3-type gkm graph ( see section  [ sect:4 ] ) .",
    "the main theorem of this paper can be stated as follows ( see sections  [ sect:2 ] and [ sect:3 ] for details ) :    [ main:1 ] let @xmath4 be an abstract @xmath3-type gkm graph .",
    "then , the following two statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath36 for some @xmath37 ; 2 .",
    "there is an @xmath11-type gkm graph @xmath12 which is an extension of @xmath4 .    because of the relation between gkm graphs and gkm manifolds , theorem  [ main:1 ] implies that the maximal dimension of torus which can act on a gkm manifold @xmath1 is bounded from above by the rank of the group of axial functions of the gkm graph induced from @xmath1 .",
    "namely , we obtain the main result of this paper as follows ( see section  [ sect:4 ] for details ) :    [ main:2 ] let @xmath9 be a gkm manifold and @xmath38 be its @xmath3-type gkm graph .",
    "assume that @xmath39 .",
    "then , the @xmath8-action on @xmath6 does not extend to any @xmath40-action .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath41 , then the @xmath8-action on @xmath6 is the maximal torus action .",
    "recall that shunji takuma also obtains a partial answer to problem  [ prob ] by introducing an obstruction class for the extension of an @xmath3-type gkm graph to an @xmath42-type gkm graph in his note @xcite .",
    "in contrast with takuma s obstruction class , our invariant is defined as the rank of a free abelian ( or equivalently as a dimension of a vector space ) , and theorem  [ main:1 ] may be regarded as the generalization of his result in @xcite .",
    "problem  [ prob ] is reminiscent of the computation of the _ torus degree of symmetry _ of a manifold @xmath43 ( see @xcite ) , i.e. , the maximal dimension of a torus which can act on @xmath43 effectively ( note that we do not assume the existence of fixed points or invariant almost complex structures on @xmath43 )",
    ". a torus degree of symmetry has been studied for many classes of manifolds ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "corollary  [ main:2 ] may be regarded as to give an upper bound of the _ torus degree of symmetry of an invariant almost complex structure _ of a gkm manifold . as an application of corollary  [ main:2 ] , in the final section ( section  [ sect:5 ] )",
    ", we compute the torus degree of such symmetry for the complex grassmannian of @xmath13-planes , denoted as @xmath44 namely , we compute @xmath45 for @xmath46 with some effective @xmath15-action and prove the following fact :    [ main:3 ] the standard effective @xmath15-action on @xmath14 is the maximal effective torus action which preserves the invariant almost complex structure .    note that there is the natural @xmath47-action on @xmath14 which is induced from the maximal torus in @xmath48 . however , this action is not effective .",

    "we also prove the @xmath49-action on @xmath50 is the maximal torus action in this section . in section  [ sect:5 ] , we show the gkm graph obtained from the effective @xmath15-action on @xmath14 , and compute its group of axial functions ; this shows proposition  [ main:3 ] .",
    "in this section , we first recall the basic facts about gkm graphs @xmath4 ( see  @xcite ) and introduce the extension of axial functions of gkm graphs precisely .",
