    "we have compiled complete or partial 15  @xmath10 m photometry for 105 spectroscopically - confirmed l and t dwarfs using united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) imaging cameras and ukirt @xmath11 and mauna kea observatory ( mko ) @xmath0 filters .",
    "diagrams of color versus near - infrared spectral type ( @xcite ) are shown in figure  [ dgolimowskif1 ] for various combinations of bandpasses .",
    "the @xmath11 through @xmath3 colors of l dwarfs are scattered because their 1@xmath12 m `` photospheres '' coincide with clouds of fe and silicate condensates with varying optical depths ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , near - ir colors are not good indicators of l subtype . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath13@xmath2 is a good indicator of t subtype presumably because , for @xmath14  k , the condensate clouds have settled below the near - infrared photosphere .",
    "conversely , @xmath2@xmath3 is broadly scattered among t dwarfs because the @xmath3 flux is affected by pressure - induced h@xmath4 absorption , which is very sensitive to surface gravity ( @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath11@xmath13 colors of t dwarfs are also scattered , possibly because of variable process(es ) responsible for removing condensates at the l ",
    "t transition , or because the @xmath11 flux is affected by the gravity- and metallicity - sensitive wings of the na - d and k resonance lines .",
    "the @xmath3@xmath15 and @xmath15@xmath5 colors of l6t4 dwarfs are nearly constant .",
    "the constancy of @xmath3@xmath15 over this range of types is explained by balanced ch@xmath16 absorption in the @xmath3 and @xmath15 bands and the redistribution of continuum flux as the condensate clouds settle . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath15@xmath5 is largely unaffected by the settling clouds .",
    "its constancy for types l6t4 reflects the constancy of @xmath7 throughout the l ",
    "t transition .",
    "( see  3 . )",
    "we have obtained @xmath1 spectra of 23 new l dwarfs and 14 new t0t7 dwarfs identified from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) photometric database using ukirt s cgs4 and uist spectrographs .",
    "we have also obtained new spectra of 11 l and t dwarfs previously identified from the two - micron all sky survey ( 2mass ) , including the coolest known t dwarf , 2mass  j04150935 .",
    "we have classified these dwarfs according to the scheme of @xcite .",
    "our augmented sample shows that some spectral indices of this scheme are not internally consistent for l dwarfs because of their apparent sensitivity to cloud optical depth .",
    "some adjustment of these indices is warranted .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif2 ] shows the @xmath2 and @xmath3 spectra of representative t6 , t7 , t8 , and t9 dwarfs .",
    "these spectra show a steady increase in the depths of the h@xmath4o and ch@xmath16 bands with increasing spectral type .",
    "the relatively small spectral differences between the dwarfs designated t8 and t9 may be more indicative of a half - subtype increment , rather than a whole - subtype increment .",
    "regardless , this sequence suggests that there is room for one more subtype , which would have essentially zero flux at 1.45 , 1.7 , and 2.25  @xmath10 m .",
    "the effects of varying cloud optical depth and gravity are manifested not only in the broadband colors of l and t dwarfs (  1 ) , but in the equivalent widths of narrower atomic and molecular absorption lines .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif3 ] compares the @xmath13 spectra of three unusually blue late - l dwarfs ( marked with circles in figure  [ dgolimowskif1 ] ) with those of more typical l dwarfs .",
    "the enhanced strengths of the feh and k  i features in the former group mimic those of earlier l dwarfs , which suggests that either the condensate clouds of these late - l dwarfs are unusually thin , or these dwarfs have low metallicity .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif4 ] shows @xmath13 spectra of several t6 and t8 dwarfs that exhibit progressively stronger absorption by k  i at 1.243 and 1.254  @xmath10 m .",
    "recent investigations of spectroscopic gravity indicators in t dwarfs indicate that this doublet strengthens with decreasing gravity ( @xcite ) .",
    "this trend is supported by the increasing @xmath2@xmath3 colors of these dwarfs ( see figure  [ dgolimowskif7 ] ) , which reflect progressively less pressure - induced h@xmath4 absorption of @xmath3-band flux as gravity decreases ( @xcite ) .",
    "we used our @xmath17 spectra , our @xmath18 photometry , and recently published parallaxes ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) to compute @xmath19 and @xmath7 for late - m , l , and t dwarfs . in doing so",
    ", we assumed a rayleigh - jeans flux distribution longward of @xmath15 appropriately corrected for ch@xmath16 and co absorption between 3 and @xmath20 m . we used available @xmath5 photometry to confirm the accuracy of these assumptions . to compute @xmath7",
    ", we adopted the ranges of brown - dwarf radii predicted by the evolutionary models of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite for ages 0.110  gyr .",
    "( narrower ranges were used for those dwarfs whose ages have been spectroscopically constrained . ) nominal values of @xmath7 for each dwarf were computed assuming a mean age of 3  gyr for the solar neighborhood ( @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif5 ] shows the behavior of @xmath19 and @xmath7 as a function of spectral type .",
    "@xmath19 rises from m5 to l5 due to wien shift and enhanced @xmath3 luminosity as clouds settle below the @xmath3 photosphere .",
    "it declines after l5 because of increasing ch@xmath16 absorption at @xmath21 m .",
    "the scatter among late - t dwarfs shows the sensitivity of h@xmath4 absorption to gravity variations .",
    "@xmath7 declines steeply and monotonically for types m6l7 and t4t9 , but is nearly constant ( @xmath22  k ) over the l ",
    "t transition .",
    "this constancy indicates that the condensate clouds settle , thin , or disintegrate over a small range of @xmath7 .",
    "thus , the presently defined l and t spectral classes are not proxies for a uniformly decreasing @xmath7 scale .",
    "we compute @xmath23750  k for the t9 dwarf 2mass  0415 - 0935 , which supplants gl  570d as the coolest known brown dwarf .",
    "we compare our absolute photometry with the magnitudes and colors of l and t dwarfs predicted by the precipitating cloud models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the models are parametrized by @xmath24 , which describes the sedimentation efficiency relative to the upward transport of condensates by convection .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif6 ] shows @xmath25 as functions of spectral type and @xmath13@xmath3 color",
    ". a polynomial fit to the data in the left panel emphasizes the brightening @xmath13 luminosity between types t0 and t4 .",
    "this `` early - t '' hump ( @xcite ) is probably caused by the thinning , settling , and/or break - up of the cloud deck , which allows @xmath13 flux to emerge from deeper layers of the atmosphere .",
    "overplotted in the right panel of figure  [ dgolimowskif6 ] are model sequences for @xmath26 , 5 , and @xmath27 ( no clouds ) and different gravities ( log  @xmath28 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 models match the l dwarf data well , but do not turn fast enough to match the t dwarf data , which are better matched by the cloudless models .",
    "the dotted lines connect the @xmath29  k points _",
    "( triangles ) _ on each model sequence .",
    "these lines bound the l ",
    "t transition , which suggests that holes in the cloud deck develop rapidly over a narrow range of @xmath7 .",
    "this notion is supported by the nearly constant @xmath30  k measured bolometrically for types l7t4 ( figure  [ dgolimowskif5 ] ) .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif7 ] is a @xmath13@xmath2 versus @xmath2@xmath3 diagram for t dwarfs overlayed with model sequences for various combinations of @xmath24 and gravity . because the radii of brown dwarfs older than 200  myr vary by @xmath31% ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , gravity is tightly correlated with mass .",
    "thus the solid curves in figure  [ dgolimowskif7 ] are effectively evolutionary tracks of brown dwarfs with masses of _",
    "( left to right ) _ 75 , 35 , 15 , and @xmath32 .",
    "consequently , the t5.5 dwarf sdss  j1110 + 0116 may be a 10@xmath33 brown dwarf . as stated in  1 ,",
    "the @xmath3 fluxes of t dwarfs are highly sensitive to gravity - dependent , pressure - induced h@xmath4 absorption .",
    "thus , @xmath2@xmath3 is a good indicator of mass , such that bluer @xmath2@xmath3 reflects higher mass for a given t subtype .",
    "the model atmospheres of @xcite assume all species are in thermochemical equilibrium .",
    "however , the @xmath34-band spectrum of the archetypal t dwarf gl  229b shows absorption at @xmath35 m by overabundant co dredged upward from hotter regions by convective mixing ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the same phenomenon should occur in other late - t dwarfs .",
    "figure  [ dgolimowskif8 ] compares the cloudy and cloud - free models of @xcite with our measurements of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 versus @xmath7 for l and t dwarfs .",
    "the log  @xmath395.5 cloudy models match @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 well for l and early - t dwarfs . the log  @xmath405.0 cloud - free models generally match @xmath36 and @xmath37 for late - t dwarfs , but they overestimate the @xmath5 luminosities of these dwarfs by factors of 1.5 to 2.5 .",
    "we attribute these @xmath5 flux deficits to nonequilibrium abundances of co , as shown by the vertical - mixing models of @xcite .",
    "these overpredicted @xmath5 fluxes affect the expected sensitivities of @xmath20 m searches for even cooler , `` infra - t '' dwarfs , as are planned with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope . _",
    "we thank didier saumon for computing the model magnitudes shown in figures  [ dgolimowskif6][dgolimowskif8 ] .",
