    "<S> for tracing the spatiotemporal evolution of electronic systems we suggest and analyze theoretically a setup that exploits the excellent spatial resolution based on scanning tunneling microscopy techniques combined with the temporal resolution of femtosecond pump - probe photoelectron spectroscopy . as an example we consider the laser - induced , local vibrational dynamics of a surface - adsorbed molecule . </S>",
    "<S> the photoelectrons released by a laser pulse can be collected by the scanning tip and utilized to access the spatio - temporal dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> our proof - of - principle calculations are based on the solution of the time - dependent schrdinger equation supported by the _ ab initio _ computation of the matrix elements determining the dynamics .    ' '' ''    * keywords * : surface photochemistry , surface vibrations , time - resolved photoemission , photo - assisted stm , dyson orbital , orbital imaging    the impressive advances made in generating and utilizing sub - femtosecond laser pulses @xcite for time - resolving the dynamics of electronic systems are paralleled with the fascinating versatility of scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) @xcite that allows for atomic spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> stm accesses also spectroscopic information that are related , under certain assumptions , to the local density of states of the probe . </S>",
    "<S> the transport through single molecules @xcite provides , for instance , insight in the analysis and manipulation of the molecular properties like the conformation @xcite , or the characterization of magnetic systems @xcite .    to explore the sub - pico second local dynamics , </S>",
    "<S> there have been proposals for inducing and probing the electron dynamics by means of focused femtosecond laser pulses applied within the stm context @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental limitations and issues experienced by earlier attempts ( mainly due the thermal expansion of the tip ) @xcite have been shown to be possible to be circumenvented by ultrafast two - photon schemes@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose in this contribution a new model system that demonstrates the feasibility for tracing the femtosecond dynamics of adsorbed atoms or molecules by means of two - photon@xcite ultrafast stm - based photoelectron detection . as a concrete example ( [ fig1 ] ) </S>",
    "<S> , we consider a metal substrate coated with the lif overlayer , where a single hcn molecule is adsorbed . </S>",
    "<S> the lif layer has the important advantage of a large band gap @xmath0 ( for the bulk at zero temperature , @xmath1  ev , ref.@xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> provided the ionization energy of adsorbate is smaller than lif work function , the dynamics of the molecule can be accessed selectively . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the strongly ionic character gives rise to a particular strong bonding of the hcn molecule ( which also has a large permanent dipole moment of 1.172  a.u . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> our molecule serves as a test object representing the simplest organic molecule and has some further convenient properties , which will be elucidated by the analysis of the electronic properties .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    our goal is to study the transient vibrational dynamics induced by a infrared ( ir ) laser pulse ( the pump pulse ) of moderate intensity and the vibronic coherent motion that can be imaged by utilizing the stm tip for recording the photocurrent ( see the ( weo1 ) for the video illustration ) . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is , strictly speaking , not identical to the stm setup in the tunneling regime . </S>",
    "<S> recent experiments @xcite have however demonstrated the feasibility and the potential of the local photoelectron detection with the tip apex , reaching a spatial resolution in range of 5  nm . </S>",
    "<S> the photoelectron is released by a second laser pulse ( the probe pulse ) that ionizes the molecule and is applied at a time delay @xmath2 with respect to the pump pulse . </S>",
    "<S> we remark that the laser intensities and frequencies are chosen such that only a single electron can be released at a time . </S>",
    "<S> the delay before launching a second pump - probe sequence is large enough to allow electrons from the metal substrate to tunnel to the hcn@xmath3 molecule ( characteristic time scale in the range of femtoseconds to picoseconds ) . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the molecule has to relax to the initial vibrational state ( time scale of picoseconds to nanosecond ) . considering both of these aspects we estimate the maximal repetition frequency of about 10  mhz for the experiment .    </S>",
    "<S> based on a cluster approach for representing the lif surface , we have found that the most stable equilibrium configuration of hcn is to stand upright on surface , with the positively charged hydrogen atom directly above a f site ( further details in the supporting information ) by bonding to the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the comparison the with cluster computations reveals that the c - n and the h - c stretching modes of the isolated hcn molecule @xcite are hardly altered ( see supporting information ) . </S>",
    "<S> this result is also expected from the chemical point of view due to the strongly ionic character of both subsystems . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , we found that the highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) of the hcn molecule ( twice degenerated @xmath4 orbital in the isolated case ) is hardly changed by the presence of the surface ( inset in [ fig1 ] ) and possesses the same symmetry .    </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the homo suggests that the excitation of the c - n stretching mode is closely related to contracting or expanding the orbital . as the homo strongly influences the photoionization properties , we expect that a particularly clear connection between the vibrational dynamics and the photocurrent can be established when analyzing the c - n stretching eigenmode . </S>",
    "<S> we thus choose as the ( one - dimensional ) vibrational coordinate @xmath5 the distance between the carbon and the nitrogen atom ( inset in [ fig1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the hydrogen atom also participates in the vibration , but with a much smaller amplitude .    for describing the laser - induced vibronic dynamics as well as the photoionization process </S>",
    "<S> , we need the @xmath5-dependent energy levels . we have computed all the corresponding potential energy surfaces ( pess ) within the range of 15  ev from the ground state and accounted only for those states with a nonzero transition matrix element whilst exploiting the dipole selection rules for the case of a linear polarization of the laser field set parallel to the molecule axis ( [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the incident laser fields are assumed to enter under small angle such that the components of the polarization perdendicular to the molecule axis can be ignored . since the molecular dynamics is slow compared to the electronic transitions driven by the probe pulse , we can assume the bond angle to be constant for the photoionization process and thus neglect a transition to pess associated to a bended conformation of the molecule@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the computations yield the transitions pathways for the light - molecule interaction : photoionization and the electronic excitation of the neutral system ( no contribution to the photocurrent ) . as both channels influence each other , including the neutral excited states is required for quantitative insights .    </S>",
    "<S> we solved the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) governing the vibrational dynamics in the presence of the infrared laser field @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter we assume a gaussian form @xmath7 with @xmath8  mev ( this value matches the transition energy from the ground state to the first excited state with respect to the potential @xmath9 ( [ fig2 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding wave length is @xmath10  @xmath11 m ) and @xmath12  fs . </S>",
    "<S> the field amplitude derives from the intensity .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    with this specific choice of the parameters the population transfer is primarily induced from the vibronic ground state to the first excited state , but the pulse spectral width due to the short pulse duration may allow higher levels to participate in the dynamics ( see [ fig3 ] , top panel , where the states are labeled with the vibrational quantum number @xmath13 ) . the corresponding coherent motion of the wave packet is represented by the time - dependent expectation value of @xmath5 ( the middle panel in [ fig3 ] ) , displaying an oscillation with an amplitude of 10  % around the equilibrium value . </S>",
    "<S> the laser field @xmath6 is shown in the bottom panel in [ fig3 ] .    to unravel how the vibronic wave packet characterized in [ fig3 ] </S>",
    "<S> can be traced in the quantities of interest , we analyzed the respective many - body tdse and derived a coupled set of equations including the bound - state dynamics and the release and propagation of exactly one photoelectron to the tip in the presence of the probe pulse . </S>",
    "<S> the assume an ultraviolet ( uv ) gaussian - shaped laser pulse ( central wave length @xmath14  nm , peak intensity and pulse length @xmath15  fs fwhh ) . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed derivation is provided in the supporting information , along with the necessary additional approximations : ( i ) we ignore correlation effects of the photoelectron with the remaining ones , ( ii ) ignore second - order overlap terms of well - localized orbitals with the continuum wave function of the released electron and ( iii ) we employ the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for the latter , we spend a few words more on the justification for our model system . </S>",
    "<S> since the diabatic coupling matrix elements of the electronic wave functions sandwiching the derivatives with respect to the vibrational coordinate are related to the velocity ( the kinetic energy ) of the nuclei ( slow on the electronic time scale ) divided by the energy level spacing of the states , these matrix elements play only a minor role as long as the electronic levels are well - separated . </S>",
    "<S> this is , e.  g. , the case for the ground state in [ fig2 ] , but not for the excited states . </S>",
    "<S> however , the physical picture of the slow nuclei implies that the diabatic coupling elements have only a minor influence on the short - time dynamics , i.  e. when restricting the pulse length of the probing electrical field to a time scale small compared to the characteristic time scale for the vibrations , the bo approximation is still valid . </S>",
    "<S> this assumption is tolerable in view of the fact that @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore specialize to the scenario sketched in [ fig4](a ) , i.  e. we assume that no transitions between the neutral excited state occur , which is ensured by the spectral properties of the probe pulse    apart from the approximations stated above , our treatment of the coupled population dynamics of the involved electronic states of the neutral molecule the released electron is exact . the photoelectron wave function is represented on a real - space grid , i.  e. it does need to be constructed invoking additional approximations . the charge interaction of the photoelectron with the ionized molecule and the time - dependent laser field is taken into account , as well .    </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally measurable quantity is the photoionization current . </S>",
    "<S> our studies have elucidated that the key quantity connecting the vibrations in the ground state pes @xmath9 and the photocurrent is the transition matrix element of the dyson orbital with the photoelectron wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the dyson orbital @xmath17 @xcite is defined as the overlap of the @xmath18electron wave function with the @xmath19electron wave function of the ionized system . </S>",
    "<S> we computed @xmath17 by approximating the dominant configurations of the ground states of both the neutral and the ionized molecule by the hartree - fock determinants . </S>",
    "<S> the ( expected ) result reveals that this dyson orbital overlaps by about 90 % with the homo . </S>",
    "<S> since the c - n stretching vibration directly contracts or expands the homo , we expect an almost linear dependence of the transition strength on the vibrational coordinate . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario is supported by the calculation of the transition matrix element ( integrated over the momentum of the photoelectron ) , depicted in [ fig4 ] .    solving the corresponding time - dependent schrdinger equation yields the photoelectron wave function and thus the measurable current density @xmath20 . for the pump - probe experiment , the time - integrated current ( i.  e. a probability ) rather than the actual time - dependent current @xmath20 contains the desired information . </S>",
    "<S> taking the projection in the direction of the tip yields the spatio - resolved probability @xmath21 of detecting a photoelectron in a plane parallel to the surface and entails the information on the initial vibrational wave packet . </S>",
    "<S> we consider a plane with a distance of @xmath22    above the nitrogen atom ( @xmath23-@xmath24 plane ) and compute the detection probability as a function of the position and the time delay @xmath2 between the pump and the probe pulse . for @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> the maximum of the uv pulse being centered at @xmath26  fs ( see inset in [ fig3](b ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the spatial dependence of @xmath21 is shown in [ fig5](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> since the photoelectron primarily originates from the dyson orbital @xmath17 , we can expect that the spatial structure of the detection probability in the detection plane is related to a cut through the @xmath23-@xmath24 plane of @xmath17 . at this point </S>",
    "<S> , we have to take for the degeneracy of the homo and add the probability contributions according to the two orientations of the dyson orbital , resulting in a radially symmetric spatial dependence . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , the probability displays a minimum directly above the molecule , as the dyson orbital has a nodal plane along the molecule axis . </S>",
    "<S> we infer thus that the dependence of @xmath21 on @xmath23 and @xmath24 yields a probability map which is closely related to viewing the dyson orbital `` from above '' .    ' '' ''    ' '' ''    we proceed by fixing @xmath23 and @xmath24 such that the detection probability is maximal and study the dependence on @xmath2 . as we have already discussed , we expect an approximately linear mapping of the coherent vibrational dynamics to the detection probability for two reasons : the dependence of ( i ) the ionization energy and ( ii ) the transition strength to the continuum on @xmath5 is almost linear . </S>",
    "<S> the result is presented in [ fig5](b ) , where the expectation value of the vibrational coordinate is also shown for a comparison . </S>",
    "<S> both curves are very similar though some higher - frequency components occur evidencing non - linear contributions . as an outcome of this study , animation ( weo2 ) illustrates the time evolution of the vibronic wave packet simultaneously with the @xmath2-dependent detection probability ( spatially resolved along the @xmath23 axis ) .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we suggested theoretically a novel experimental setup to access the spatio - temporal dynamics of adsorbates . </S>",
    "<S> the proposal is based on a combination of pump - probe techniques with a local detection scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrated the model by studying explicitly a sample consisting of a hcn molecule adsorbed on a lif overlayer deposited on a metal substrate . </S>",
    "<S> we studied how the molecule is adsorbed on the surface and find that the vibrational as well as the electronic properties are hardly altered . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed setup involved ( i ) the excitation of a coherent vibronic wave packet due to an infrared pump pulse , and ( ii ) the photoionization of the adsorbed molecule by an ultraviolet probe pulse . </S>",
    "<S> ( iii ) the photoelectrons are detected by the stm tip . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated by a proof - of - principle calculation how the vibronic wave packet can be mapped onto a probability @xmath21 detected by the stm tip . </S>",
    "<S> the tip position yields the spatial dependence and can be exploited to image the involved orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> the temporal dependence with respect to the pump - probe delay @xmath2 yields a measurable signal which closely resembles the time - dependent expectation value of the vibrational coordinate @xmath5 , characterizing the coherent dynamics . while our proof - of - principle study concentrates on a rather simple molecule , a generalization to more complex systems is conceptionally straight forward . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of spatial and temporal resolution potentially coalesces in , e.  g. , probing relaxation and decoherence processes or photo - induced conformation switching on single molecules in the time domain . </S>"
