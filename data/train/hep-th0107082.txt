    "the study of resonances in relativistic models has provided important insights into the general problem of the dynamics of quantum field theories .",
    "resonances are usually due to unstable bound states which therefore do not appear as asymptotic states",
    ". however , associated to them , there are mass scales which may induce interesting and unexpected phenomena .",
    "zamolodchikov , for instance , has shown in @xcite that a single resonance state produces a remarkable pattern of roaming renormalization group trajectories , with the property that they pass by very closely all minimal unitary models of conformal field theory , finally ending in the massive phase of the ising model .",
    "the first model with an infinite number of resonance states is due to a. zamolodchikov , in relation with a qft characterized by a dynamical @xmath0 symmetry @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . a simpler class of models with infinitely many resonance states have been considered by mussardo and penati in @xcite .",
    "the analysis performed in @xcite of the form factors and the correlation functions of these theories has shown a rather rich and still unexplored behaviour of such theories .",
    "a further step in the analysis of infinite resonance models has been taken by castro  alvaredo and fring in @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to extend the analysis of the physical effects induced by an infinite tower of resonance states , this time also placed at the boundary of a @xmath1 dimensional quantum field theory .",
    "we will consider , in particular , the boundary dynamics of two models which were previously defined in @xcite .",
    "those may be regarded as the generalizations of the massive thermal ising model and of the sinh - gordon model , respectively . in the bulk",
    "both theories have a single stable excitation of mass @xmath2 .",
    "our main purpose is to analyse the boundary behaviour of these theories and to show some novel phenomena induced by the resonance states . in particular , for the generalization of the ising model we study the ground state energy and the one  point correlator of the thermal operator in the short  distance limit .",
    "contrary to the ordinary case , where these functions scale as a constant and as an inverse power respectively , here they both assume an oscillating behaviour , hinting to the fact that the infinite series of boundary resonances does not decouple from the theory even at very short distance scales .",
    "the oscillating nature of these quantities prevents a standard conformal field theory interpretation of the theory at short distances .",
    "hence , the boundary seems to have a more drastic effect on the theory with respect to the bulk , where the presence of an infinite number of resonances has the effect to make softer its ultraviolet properties leaving , however , the possibility to recover a conformal behaviour and to define conformal data such as the central charge or the anomalous dimensions @xcite .",
    "the scattering and reflection amplitudes of the two theories investigated in this paper can be expressed , in the rapidity variable @xmath3 , in terms of jacobian elliptic functions , which are periodic along both the complex axis .",
    "the resonance states correspond to poles in the unphysical sheet of the scattering amplitude .",
    "the choice of doubly periodic scattering amplitudes forces us to consider only theories without any genuine bound states , otherwise the presence of a pole on the imaginary axis inside the physical strip would imply a proliferation of infinite other poles located at the same imaginary position but at non vanishing real one , spoiling the causality of the theory .    a complete list of properties of the jacobian elliptic functions can be found in @xcite .",
    "here we simply recall that these functions , indicated by @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , depend on a parameter @xmath7 ( called modulus ) which varies between 0 and 1 , and have poles and zeroes located with double periodicity on the complex plane of @xmath8 . in our notation",
    "the rapidity variable @xmath3 will enter the argument of these functions in the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the complete elliptic integral of modulus @xmath7 , defined as @xmath11 we will also write many expressions in terms of the complementary modulus @xmath12 and of the corresponding complete elliptic integral @xmath13 . in the limit @xmath14 only the periodicity along the imaginary axis in @xmath3 survives , and we recover the ordinary scattering theories without resonance states .",
    "the corresponding asymptotics of our functions are given by @xmath15 @xmath16 we anticipate here that all the physical quantities we have studied share the same qualitative behaviour for every @xmath17 , while possible discontinous changes may occur for @xmath14 .",
    "integrable quantum field theories with boundary ( _ i.e. _ defined on half  line and with the boundary placed at @xmath18 ) have been defined and analyzed in @xcite . here",
    ", we will focus on systems with a single bulk excitation and without any bulk or boundary bound states .",
    "in particular , we recall that the physical strip is given by @xmath19 for the bulk scattering matrix @xmath20 and by @xmath21 for the boundary reflection matrix @xmath22 .    in our simple case , the two basic equations of unitarity and crossing , respectively , assume the form : @xmath23 @xmath24 following @xcite , where the @xmath20-matrix was assumed to have both an imaginary and a real periodicity , we will look for solutions to eq .",
