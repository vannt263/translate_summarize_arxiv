    "a 2-dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) in a magnetic field has proved to be an extremely rich subject for theoretical and experimental investigation @xcite . for example , considerable effort has been devoted to the study of the integral and fractional quantum hall effects ( i and fqhe ) , transport properties and edge states @xcite . except in a few cases",
    "@xcite , however , the magnetic field considered was homogeneous . in this article",
    "we address the problem of a magnetic field varying linearly with position added to an underlying homogeneous field .",
    "this is of relevance because in real systems : ( a ) a constant magnetic field is not always attainable , and ( b ) an inhomogeneous field may be desired .",
    "another interesting point is that in the composite fermion ( cf ) theory @xcite which is used to describe the fqhe , the electron - electron interaction , necessary for the appearance of the fqhe , is incorporated into an effective magnetic field via a singular gauge transformation .",
    "the result is a system of non - interacting quasi - particles carrying a fictitious magnetic flux in an inhomogeneous effective magnetic field .",
    "a better understanding of the properties of a simple non - interacting electron gas in an inhomogeneous field might therefore bring useful insights into cf theory .",
    "to investigate the electronic properties of a non - interacting electron gas in a linearly varying magnetic field we consider the following hamiltonian @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the confining potential due to the walls @xmath3 $ ] , @xmath4 is the position of the edge of the system , @xmath5 is the spin operator and @xmath6 for the g - factor .",
    "the parameters @xmath7 and @xmath8 allow the shape of the potential to change continuously from very sharp to very smooth , which can modify the properties of the system @xcite . by solving @xmath9",
    "we can obtain the electron density @xmath10 where we sum over all states with energy @xmath11 , and the current density for a state @xmath12 @xcite @xmath13 + \\frac{e}{m_{e}}\\nabla\\times\\left [ \\chi^{\\ast}_{n}(x , y){\\bf s}\\chi_{n}(x , y)\\right].\\ ] ] as a result of our choice of @xmath14 and @xmath15 , the symmetry of the hamiltonian allows us to write the wave function as @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a good quantum number , and we then obtain the 1-dimensional schrdinger equation @xmath18 \\psi(y ) = e \\psi(y),\\ ] ] with @xmath19 .",
    "eq.(5 ) then enables us to derive the dispersion curves @xmath20 , and to rewrite the electron density as @xmath21 and the current density for one state @xmath12 and a fixed @xmath17 as @xmath22 + \\frac{e \\hbar s}{m_{e } } \\frac{\\partial\\left[\\psi^{\\ast}_{n}(y)\\psi_{n}(y)\\right]}{\\partial y},\\ ] ] both now solely functions of @xmath23 . due to the symmetry of the system",
    "there is a current density only along the @xmath24 axis .",
    "integrating over @xmath23 will give the total current @xmath25 carried , for a fixed @xmath17 by the state @xmath12 and summing over @xmath12 and @xmath17 the total current @xmath26 .",
    "starting from eq.(5 ) the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath27 \\psi(y)&=&e\\psi(y),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] + with @xmath28 and @xmath29 . for what follows it",
    "is useful to introduce the dimensionless variable @xmath30 and @xmath31 which yields for ( 8) @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 now given in unit of energy .",
    "although in some simplified cases it is possible to obtain analytical results , as we will see below , there is in general no way to find the analytical solution of eq .",
    "( 9 ) , and therefore we have to resort to numerical calculations .",
    "eq.(9 ) can be solved by expanding @xmath35 in terms of oscillator functions , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is a hermite polynomial , and then by numerically diagonalising the corresponding secular equation @xmath38 using the properties of the hermite polynomials all the matrix elements @xmath39 can be calculated analytically ( appendix ) which greatly improves the diagonalisation method .",
    "however before starting with the numerical calculations we can try an analytical approach to eq.(8 ) in the simplified case where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we then have @xmath42\\psi(y)=e \\psi(y).\\ ] ] we choose two regimes for which @xmath43 : ( a ) @xmath44 , single well potential ( swp ) , near @xmath45 , and ( b ) @xmath46 , double well potential ( dwp ) , near @xmath47 .",
    "we expand parabolically around the minima of the effective potential and obtain harmonic oscillator equations which we solve analytically .",
    "the expressions obtained for the energy are @xmath48\\ ] ] @xmath49,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 . from here",
    "it is straightforward to derive the group velocity ( @xmath51 ) for the state @xmath12 as @xmath52\\ ] ] @xmath53\\ ] ]",
    "in the following calculations the system we consider corresponds to an ideal slab of @xmath54 heterostructure filled with an ideal 2deg .",
    "the effective electron mass is @xmath55 , the electron density @xmath56 , and the sample has width , when @xmath57 , @xmath58 and length @xmath59 with periodic boundary conditions along @xmath24 .    in fig.[1 ]",
    "are reported the numerical and the analytical results ( eqs.(12),(13 ) ) for the case when @xmath41 , @xmath60 , and @xmath40 .",
    "we can see that the agreement is very good except around @xmath61 where the method breaks down .",
    "although it is possible to obtain useful information from analytical calculations they do not allow us to derive complete dispersion curves and hence the electron or current densities .",
    "moreover we are interested in taking into account the effects of a confining potential @xmath62 but this can not be included in our analytical approach .",
    "we have then to use a numerical approach .",
    "so , starting from the same model system configuration as above but this time with @xmath63 and , @xmath64 .",
    "we chose @xmath65 and @xmath66 which correspond to quite a sharp confining potential .",
    "the dispersion curves are plotted in fig . [ 2 ] .",
    "the degeneracy of the energy levels is completely removed and the new structure appearing in the dispersion curves is due to the breaking of the @xmath23 symmetry in the hamiltonian .",
    "it is interesting to note that some similar features were observed in the case of a curved 2deg in a constant magnetic field @xcite .",
    "having @xmath67 and @xmath68 we can now calculate @xmath69 and @xmath70 , but to do this we need the fermi energy @xmath71 .",
    "this can be obtained by minimising the total energy with the constraint that the number of electrons @xmath72 is constant with @xmath72 given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 are the parameters we vary to minimize the energy .",
    "as we might expect , @xmath71 does not depend on @xmath17 but , in contrast to the assumption in @xcite , it is not independent of the magnetic field . this is shown in fig . [ 3 ] where @xmath71 has been calculated for various values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "this dependence is due , in the absence of external leads , to the walls , which can be seen by the fact that when @xmath75 , which in contrast to @xmath76 removes the degeneracy of the states and gives rise to an effective confining potential , increases , @xmath71 becomes independent of the magnetic field .    using @xmath71 we can now calculate the electron density @xmath70 . in fig . [",
    "4 ] @xmath70 is plotted for different values of @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "we see that with an external confining potential ( @xmath63 ) @xmath70 is not constant ; it can have quite a rich structure with local charging effects .",
    "moreover , when @xmath77 , @xmath70 becomes asymmetric in @xmath23 .",
    "it has to be noted that in the case @xmath41 @xmath70 is constant the oscillations on left and right hand side of the graphic are only a numerical effect due to the fact that in this case one should use a larger set of @xmath78 for the expansion of @xmath79 .",
    "but for @xmath63 the structure of @xmath70 can be explained in the following way . when the number of states as a function of @xmath17 is plotted a discontinuous curve due to the quantisation of the energy",
    "is obtained .",
    "although there is no simple relation between the @xmath17 space and the real space , as for a homogeneous magnetic field , the number of oscillations of the electron density is the same as the number of steps in the discontinuous curve and then is indeed a consequence of the energy quantisation .",
    "this can be seen in figs .",
    "[ 5 ] and [ 6 ] .",
    "the next step now is , by means of eq.(7 ) , to calculate the total current density given by @xmath80 where the sum runs over all the states with @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ 7 ] are reported the current densities for different magnetic fields disregarding first the part due to the spin .",
    "one sees that the shape of the current density is much more subtle than might be expected from semi - classical approximations .",
    "actually considering @xmath69 for @xmath81 or , in other words for the largest @xmath17 close to the fermi energy , the movement of the electron can be described by its classical orbits ( drifting orbits along the edge and snake orbits in the opposite direction along the line where @xmath82 ) . for smaller @xmath17 , however , the states tunnelling between the two wells but mainly the ones of energy above the central maximum of the double well are very important and their contribution can not be overlooked .",
    "in fact @xmath69 , after summing over all @xmath12 and @xmath17 , turns out to be very small for the case where @xmath83 . in fig . [ 8 ] are reported different @xmath69 . for @xmath84 , @xmath85 and",
    "@xmath86 the movement of the electron is well defined by its classical orbits ( edge and snake orbits ) .",
    "but around @xmath61 and for exemple here @xmath87 the situation is more complicated .",
    "an interesting point is that now the current density for one state can be positive _ and _ negative as a function of @xmath23 .",
    "moreover we see that the positive part is located in @xmath23 where the density of current flows in the other direction due to the presence of the snake orbits .",
    "the same kind of phenomena appears with edge orbits .",
    "this can be understand by considering the first term @xmath88 in eq.(7 ) .",
    "it is easy to imagine that when summing the current density over all the different states the result is rather different from what we might expect from the consideration of the simple classical picture of the orbits .",
    "it has to be noted that although the current density can be positive and negative as a function of @xmath23 , the group velocity @xmath89 has a well defined sign and has been verified from the dispersion curves by means of the relation @xmath90 . in order to get a better understanding of the shape of the current density we have plotted together the electron and the current densities in fig .",
    "[ 9 ] and[10 ] .",
    "the density of current oscillates between positive and negative `` channels '' as a function of the electron density and then is a reflection of the quantisation of the energy .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the study of the fqhe there is also the appearance of channels which can be seen there as alternating strips of compressible and incompressible fluid @xcite .",
    "when @xmath77 the current density increases with @xmath76 and flows in opposite directions on both sides of the sample when @xmath76 is large enough compared to @xmath75 or in other words when @xmath76 is large enough to overcome the effective confining potential due to @xmath75 so that the electrons are confined by the external confining potential @xmath62 .",
    "moreover the current density becomes asymmetric .",
    "+ until now only the first term in eq.(7 ) has been considered but there is a second term containing the derivative of the electron density and directly related to the presence of the spin for the electron . because , as we have seen above , the electron density displays a very rich structure , one can expect some contribution to the current density due to the spin of the electron .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ 11 ] and [ 12 ] .",
    "although the part due to the spin is smaller than the first term in eq.(7 ) it is nevertheless noticable .",
    "this could imply some interesting phenomena in relation to spin polarised currents .",
    "the problem is that the `` channels '' are more or less at the same position for spin up or down which makes it quite difficult to distinguish between both spin directions .",
    "on the other hand , many parameters can be varied , such as the magnetic field , the width of the system or the external confining potential which may allow us to find a suitable system configuration for the production of polarised currents .",
    "+ finally it has to be stressed that all the discussion above concerned the current density . although this quantity is non - zero and has a rich structure , it does not imply that the net current @xmath91 is non - zero .",
    "in fact as our calculation showed @xmath71 is independent of @xmath17 which means there is no difference of potential across our system and thus no net current .",
    "in this work we have studied the effect of a linear magnetic field in a 2deg . in certain simplified cases we were able to carry out some analytical calculations and to derive the dispersion curves @xmath92 for quite a large range of @xmath93 .",
    "these results were found to be in very good agreement with our numerical results . in the general case with an external confining potential we carried out numerical calculations .",
    "we derived the whole of the dispersion curve and using it , we calculated the electron and current densities .",
    "it is worthwhile noting that for this calculation we need to consider the states for @xmath94 _ as well as _",
    "states for @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "this point is important and could help in understanding some recent results @xcite obtained in the framework of cf theory . for the derivation of the electron and current density we first calculated the fermi energy @xmath71 taking into account that the number of electrons is constant .",
    "it turned out that although @xmath71 is independent of @xmath17 it is , however , a function of the magnetic field .",
    "this is due to the external confining potential .",
    "the electron and current densities show a very rich structure which can be seen as a consequence of the quantisation of the energy , although there is no simple relation between the @xmath17 and @xmath23 space as is the case for a constant magnetic field .",
    "moreover the current density exhibits alternating `` channels '' of positive and negative current",
    ". it would be interesting too to include interaction between electrons and to study the effect of the self - consistency on the way the energy levels cross the fermi energy .",
    "this can give rise to interesting phenomena , particularly in connection with the shape of the electron density @xcite .",
    "finally , because @xmath70 is not constant we have a contribution to the current density directly due to the spin of the electron which could imply some interesting phenomena in relation to spin polarised currents .      using the properties of the hermite polynomial the matrix elements",
    "@xmath97 can be derived in a recursive way .",
