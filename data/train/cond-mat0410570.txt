    "this is in strong disagreement to theoretical proposals for thin film , or even bulk samples .",
    "the comparison of our primary data obtained in film nb@xmath21 with ancillary data obtained in a bulk sample of mgb@xmath8 , suggest that the tmi exhibit noticeable differences when observed in films or bulk samples .",
    "our tem and xrd data suggest that in nb@xmath21 the smp feature is probably motivated by the interaction of vortices with some kind of correlated disorder existing probably due to the tendency of films that are annealed during deposition to exhibit a columnar growth .    on the other hand ,",
    "the respective crystallographic data for the less disordered nb@xmath0 film , which has not been annealed during deposition , suggest that its mixed - state properties are governed mainly by point - like disorder . as a result nb@xmath0 exhibited the conventional pe in the vicinity of the upper - critical fields .",
    "the end points of the pe exhibit a narrow hysteretic behavior ( @xmath276 mk ) , when high magnetic fields are applied .",
    "our results indicate that sharp drops which are usually observed in magnetoresistance data , obtained in low-@xmath11 superconductors , should be interpreted with caution .",
    "such findings should not be directly related to a phase transition of vortex matter .",
    "it is only measurements of equilibrium properties that can prove a true phase transition of vortex matter .",
    "according to our results , the mechanism of surface superconductivity is probably responsible for the residual part of the magnetoresistance in the region @xmath277 . by studying the high field regime in detail",
    ", we showed that in contrast to current theoretical treatment the effect is observed not only when the magnetic field is parallel , but also when is normal to the surface of our nb films .    finally , let us note that despite the different physical causes , the resulting phase diagrams of vortex matter in our nb disordered films , have strong analogies to the ones observed in disordered high-@xmath11 superconductors .",
    "the magnetization is estimated when demagnetization corrections are taken into account by claiming that the initial slope of the measured curve should correspond to the meissner state in which @xmath278 equals the applied magnetic field . at the same result",
    "we arrive if we correct the resulting magnetization by a demagnetization factor @xmath279 estimated by the approximate formula @xmath280 which holds for the case of a flat disk of thickness @xmath139 and  diameter ",
