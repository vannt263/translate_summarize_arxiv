    "self - assembled quantum dots are three - dimensional inclusions of one material in another one ( a matrix ) .",

    "the lattice mismatch gives rise to a built - in inhomogeneous elastic strain which in turn produces significant changes in the electronic band structure .",

    "nearly all papers concerning electronic structure calculations of quantum dots start with evaluation of elastic strain . especially important",
    "is the strain distribution for type - ii quantum dots where the confining potential for one type of carriers is mainly due to the strain inhomogeneity .",
    "@xcite    there are a lot of theoretical works on the strain distribution in quantum dot structures ( for a review , see refs .  ) .",
    "in addition to numerical calculations ( using finite difference , @xcite finite element , @xcite valence force field , @xcite and molecular dynamics @xcite methods ) , some analytical techniques have been proposed .",

    "also a number of results obtained in thermoelasticity theory may be applied to lattice - mismatched heterostructures , as pointed out in ref . .",
    "different methods have their own merits and restrictions . in our opinion ,",
    "an ideal solution of the elastic inclusion problem has to be analytical , to be expressed in terms of elementary functions and written in closed form , to be applicable to a broad range of inclusion shapes , and to take into account elastic anisotropy and atomistic corrections .",
    "analytical closed - form solutions have been found for few cases of inclusion shapes : an ellipsoid , @xcite a cuboid , @xcite a pyramid , @xcite and a variety of quantum - wire - like structures .",
    "@xcite nozaki and taya  @xcite have presented a general solution for an arbitrary polyhedron , but it is extremely complicated .",
    "all these solutions imply elastic isotropy and ( except the case of ellipsoidal inclusion ) equal elastic constants of the two media .",
    "the aim of our paper is to develop a novel approach to constructing the solutions for the general case of a polyhedral inclusion , and to propose a new insight into the structure of a solution .",

    "elastic moduli of the inclusion are assumed to be equal to ones of the matrix , but the matrix and the inclusion have different lattice constants .",
    "this produces an elastic strain in both the inclusion and the matrix , and the task is to determine the strain tensor as a function of coordinates , @xmath0 .",
    "we neglect atomistic and nonlinearity effects , assuming that the lattice mismatch is small , and lattice constants are small in comparison with the inclusion size .",

    "therefore , taking the elastic anisotropy into account is an actual problem .    in this section",

    "( [ eq : integrals ] ) , one proceeds from `` volume charge '' to `` surface dipoles '' on faces of the inclusion surface , and to `` linear charges '' and `` multipoles '' on its edges .",
    "thus , our method allows to split the strain tensor into contributions of faces and edges of inclusion surface ( assuming that inclusion shape is a polyhedron ) : @xmath249 where indices @xmath22 and @xmath24 run over all faces and edges , correspondingly .",

    "in summary , we propose a new , more simple and flexible expression for strain field in and around an inclusion buried in an infinite or semi - infinite isotropic medium .",
    "this expression was also implemented as a computer program.@xcite we show that the strain field can be presented as a sum of contributions of the faces and edges .",
    "this is the main point of our method ; it gives a possibility to construct expressions for strain distribution in inclusions of complicated shapes .",
    "the general solution is applied to important particular cases of pyramidal and hut - cluster inclusions .",
    "our solution for the pyramid reproduces previous solutions , but in a simpler and intuitively understandable form .",
    "we believe that it paves the way for further simplifications and generalizations of the solution , for example , to the case of anisotropic elasticity .",

    "here we present some explicit formulas expressing solid angles as functions of coordinates .",
    "a solid angle @xmath35 , that a surface @xmath254 subtends at a point @xmath12 , may be defined as an integral over the surface : @xmath255 where @xmath256 is a surface element , @xmath112 is a unit vector directed normally to this surface element , and @xmath30 is a position vector of the surface element .",
    "this integral is easily evaluated if the surface @xmath254 is a rectangle . for simplicity , let this rectangle lie in the plane @xmath257 , and its edges be oriented along the axes @xmath81 and @xmath82 ( fig .",

    "if it is looked at from outside , and is negative otherwise , one should choose the proper order of following of the vertices @xmath129 , @xmath273 , @xmath274 .",
    "namely , the closed contour @xmath276 should follow in a clockwise direction , seeing from outside the inclusion ( as shown by dashed arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : solid]b ) .",
    "so the triple scalar product @xmath277\\,\\mathbf{c}$ ] is positive ( negative ) if the outer ( inner ) side of the triangular face is seen from the point @xmath179 .",
