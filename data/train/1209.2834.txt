    "in order to reproducibly deposit dna molecules on metallic electrodes , a microscopy technique is needed to observe the molecules on the substrate .",
    "two main microscopy techniques have sufficient resolution to properly image dna molecules . transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) is the oldest technique which allows to study dna molecules and still offers the best spacial resolution and chemical sensitivity .",
    "however it has the disadvantage that molecules have to be deposited on thin suspended carbon films on a tem grid .",
    "a special surface treatment is required in order to capture dna molecules on hydrophobic carbon films , and often molecules have to be `` stained '' with heavy metal salts ( uranyl acetate ) to improve contrast @xcite .",
    "recently atomic force microscopy emerged as an alternative technique for visualization of single dna molecules @xcite , in liquid and in air . for this purpose dna molecules",
    "must first be absorbed on a flat surface , which is usually mica because it can be easily cleaved in order to provide an atomically flat surface . in the past few years afm resolution",
    "achieved incredible improvements .",
    "for example recently it was shown that it is possible to determine the chemical structure of organic molecules absorbed on a surface using an atomic force microscope in a mode where individual atoms can be resolved @xcite .",
    "mica and dna are both negatively charged in a water solution and therefore there is no adsorption of dna onto mica when only monovalent salt is present in solution at neutral ph @xcite .",
    "binding sites can be created by adding a poly - valent salt such as @xmath15 .",
    "table [ lambdadna ] gives the chemical composition of a a typical solution we used for deposition of lambda dna molecules onto a mica substrate .",
    "the choice of the ammonium acetate buffer is unusual , it is chosen mainly for consistency with buffers used in @xcite .",
    "historically this choice is also motivated by the use of ammonium acetate in some standard protocols from electron microscopy on dna molecules @xcite .",
    "the solution of table [ lambdadna ] contains only a very small amount of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ( edta ) from the native solution , hence it is not suitable for dna storage .",
    "edta neutralizes metallic ions such as @xmath16 or @xmath17 which are always present in small quantity in solution , and act as catalysts for metal - dependent enzymes which can damage dna . for this reason we never used solutions from tab .",
    "[ lambdadna ] for longer than a single day .",
    ".solution for deposition of dna onto mica for afm imaging [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to our surprise all four samples with room temperature resistance @xmath18 exhibited superconducting behavior at low temperature .",
    "indeed contrarily to the experiment @xcite where superconducting electrodes where used to contact the dna molecules , our platinum / carbon contacts are in a normal state .",
    "the dependence on temperature for different magnetic fields is shown for two samples on figs .",
    "( [ fig : figdnatemp],[fig : figdnatemp4kohms ] ) .",
    "superconductivity appeared below @xmath19 and results in a drop of resistance that saturates at low temperature because of the finite resistance of the normal contacts .",
    "the 10 @xmath20 sample displayed a very smooth transition as a function of temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnatemp ] ) and the drop of resistance saturated at @xmath21 .",
    "in contrast less resistive samples had a sharper transition ( see for e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnatemp4kohms ] ) with a saturation temperature around @xmath22 .",
    "the smooth transition observed in the 10 @xmath20 sample has some similarities to smooth transitions observed in superconductor - normal - superconductor ( sns ) junctions in the intermediate regime between a long and a short junction .",
    "a long sns junctions is characterized by the presence of two transitions .",
    "the transition at the highest temperature , stems from the transition of the superconducting contacts while at a lower temperature proximity induced superconductivity sets - in in the normal region @xcite . when the length of the normal part is decreased the two transitions merge into a single smoother transition @xcite . since in our samples",
    "only a single transition is observed , this suggests that we have created an sns junction in this intermediate regime .",
    "a possible origin of the superconductivity is the gallium contamination deposited by the fib .",
    "an insight on the size of the superconducting contamination islands is provided by the dependence on magnetic field . under a magnetic field",
    "the resistance of the samples increased , however the maximal magnetic field available in our setup ( @xmath23 ) was not sufficient to completely destroy superconductivity at low temperature indicating a critical magnetic field of the order of @xmath24 ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : figdnatemp ] and [ fig : figdnatemp4kohms ] ) . assuming the presence of superconducting nanoparticles we can also understand the origin of this relatively high critical field .",
    "the magnetic field destroys superconductivity in a nanoparticle when it creates a flux of the order of the flux quantum through the nanoparticle surface @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the nanoparticle radius .",
    "this criterion gives a typical nanoparticle radius of the order of @xmath27 . through extensive afm / sem characterization of the measured sample ( see section [ chap : fibafmsem ] ) we were able to establish that these nanoparticles were deposited by fib .",
    "gallium is superconducting with transition temperature @xmath28 , the presence of carbon impurities may increase this transition temperature to @xmath29 .",
    "indeed tungsten wires deposited with fib containing gallium and carbon have critical temperature @xmath30 whereas the pure tungsten has critical temperature around @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "thus it is probable that the source of superconductivity are superconducting nanoparticles inside ( and even outside ! ) the gap cut by the fib .",
    "the nanoparticles themselves can not give rise to ohmic resistances of a few @xmath32 , hence the large amplitude of the resistance ( drop for e.g. from @xmath33 to @xmath34 ) between the normal and the superconducting states , indicates a configuration where a normal nanowire connecting the contacts is rendered superconducting by proximity effect from the nanoparticles . to conclude on the dependence on magnetic field , one of the samples displayed squid like modulation in the magnetoresistance with a period of @xmath35 at temperature @xmath36 .",
    "these oscillations disappeared at lower and higher temperatures @xmath37 and @xmath38 suggesting a complex geometry with several sns junctions connected in series and/or in parallel .",
    "we have also measured the differential resistance of the sample as a function of a dc current .",
    "the results for the @xmath39 sample are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnadvdi ] and resemble the data obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite on dna samples with superconducting rhenium contacts . at zero magnetic field",
    "the differential resistance exhibits a large drop in the current interval @xmath40 . inside the gap region",
    "the resistance drops smoothly but does not vanish probably because of the contact resistance of the normal electrodes . in our interpretation",
    "the large peak at @xmath41 corresponds to the critical current of a nanoparticle .",
    "the smaller peaks may appear due to other nanoparticles weakly connected in series or in parallel in our conducting junction .",
    "as suggested by the colorscale diagram , the critical current decreases when a magnetic field is applied . at the maximal available magnetic field @xmath42 ,",
    "the critical current is @xmath43 since as stressed above our magnetic fields are not strong enough to completely suppress superconductivity .",
    "the three other less resistive junctions give similar @xmath44 dependence ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figdnadvdi4 ] ) . in these other samples more peaks are apparent and one of the junctions was hysteric .",
    "figure  [ fig : figdnadvdi4 ] also presents the low temperature differential conductance of the resistive junction with room temperature resistance of 10@xmath45 . at low temperature",
    "this sample becomes insulating at low bias voltage . when the bias exceeds @xmath46 the conductance starts to increase following a cone shape typical for graphite but a priori unexpected in our samples .",
    "an hysteric singularity appears when the bias reaches a value around @xmath47 .",
    "although it is hard to determine with certitude the origin of this hysteresis we note that @xmath47 is close to the estimated homo - lumo gap in dna and that similar singularities were observed at room temperature in the conduction of dna / lipid films confined between nanogaps @xcite . in this respect this is the only sample whose dc transport characteristics can hardly be mimicked by a metallic short - circuit of very small dimensions .    in order to search for sample characteristics",
    "which might be specific of dna molecules we have irradiated our samples with microwaves .",
    "our idea was that the helix structure of the molecule could induce special magnetic field asymmetry in the out of equilibrium transport across the molecule .",
    "this expectation was not confirmed experimentally since the @xmath48 dependence under irradiation remained rather symmetrical .",
    "however the dc - magnetoresistance of our samples could become unstable under microwave irradiation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnarf ] ) .",
    "interestingly instabilities were observed mainly at rather low frequencies @xmath49 . a possible ( although science fiction like ) interpretation is that the microwave field excites a mechanical transition between two possible equilibrium positions for a dna molecule suspended across the peaks created on both sides of the gap by the fib etching ; in this scenario the superconductivity just enhances the sensibility to these mechanical vibrations .",
    "however one must take into account that the response to microwave may be very complicated in superconducting weak links where the switching may become chaotic . in particular magnetic field",
    "anti - symmetric photovoltaic effect was observed in such systems by @xcite .",
    "hence the presence of a magnetic field asymmetry does not allow to discriminate between a chiral molecule like dna and an array of superconducting weak links .    in the above experiments we have assumed that superconductivity was induced by superconducting nanoparticles because of the high critical magnetic fields .",
    "yet it is not the only possibility since fib irradiation can induce superconductivity in materials with otherwise very small critical temperatures .",
    "for example the tungsten deposited under fib has critical temperatures around @xmath19 and a high critical magnetic field of @xmath50 .",
    "hence there is also a possibility that the pt bumps observed on the edges of the gap ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : fibafm ] ) could become superconducting due to a high concentration of incorporated gallium atoms . in order to check experimentally",
    "if this is indeed the case we have deliberately prepared a short - circuit across a clean pt film by stopping the fib etching before the gap became completely insulating ( this may be compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : fibetchtime ] where the metallic film was etched until the gap became insulating ) . in this control sample superconductivity",
    "was absent , but low temperature measurements revealed a low bias differential resistance peak increasing at low temperature ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : figptnodna ] ) in a behavior reminiscent of dynamical coulomb blockade @xcite .",
    "the effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : figptnodna ] is smaller by an order of magnitude compared to ref .  @xcite .",
    "this is probably because we measured a short - circuit much more conductive than conductance quantum , however short - circuits formed by fib can be more resistive see for e.g. fig .",
    "[ fig : fibetchtime ] .",
    "hence it is plausible that fib etching can create quasi - one dimensional filaments inside the gap capable of producing dynamical coulomb blockade behavior .",
    "in general these superconducting nanoparticles are unlikely to induce superconductivity in a normal metallic conductor because of the inverse proximity effect .",
    "direct proximity effect is possible in this regime only if the density of states in the normal metal is very low .",
    "for example it was recently proposed that nanoparticles could induce superconductivity in graphene @xcite . since dna molecules have a very low density of states they are good candidates for forming the normal region of our sns junctions .",
    "the image that then comes to mind ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figptnodna ] ) is that of a dna molecule connecting several nanoparticles and connected to the normal ptc contacts .",
    "however it is also possible that the nano - filaments created by fib can be small enough for the direct proximity effect to be possible .",
    "indeed , even if the gaps were insulating before deposition of dna , one can imagine that the metallic residues inside the gap could have been displaced by the dna molecules creating a leak .",
    "note that the absence of superconductivity in the control sample from fig .",
    "[ fig : figptnodna ] does not rule out this scenario .",
    "indeed we will show in the next section that the deposition of nanoparticle is not a reproducible phenomena and a single control short - circuit sample may not be representative .",
    "it is actually hard to discriminate between these two possibilities .",
    "our samples do not have a backgate since they are prepared on mica , heating up to the denaturation temperature of dna is not possible since pure gallium melts at low temperature of @xmath51 and experiments in liquid may simply break the device by removing the pentylamine layer . as a result we have chosen ultraviolet ( uv ) irradiation as the most distinctive experiment ,",
    "indeed it is well established that uv can damage the dna molecules whereas it is not harmful for a metallic film provided that there is no heating from the uv lamp .",
    "we tried to irradiate one of the samples with an uv irradiation with wavelength @xmath52 .",
    "the electrical conduction disappeared immediately ( on the scale of seconds ) after the uv lamp was switched , whereas the resistivity of a platinum film of a few nanometers thickness did not change after an hour of irradiation .",
    "even if this experiment is spectacular it is not necessarily conclusive because an electrical discharge could have occurred when the lamp was switched on ( the lamp and resistance measuring equipment are connected through a common connection to the ground ) .",
    "probably in future experiments uv must be attenuated to observe a more progressive transition .    if our interpretation in term of proximity - induced superconductivity in dna molecules is valid , the number of peaks in the differential resistance measurements ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : figdnadvdi ] and figs .",
    "[ fig : figdnadvdi4].a , b , c ) gives an estimation of the number of nanoparticles connected to the dna molecules that transit to the superconducting state .",
    "two limiting cases may occur depending on the number of connected dna molecules that exhibit proximity induced superconductivity :    * * 1 .",
    "* it is possible that only a single molecule transits into the superconducting state . in this case",
    "each peak in the differential resistance should correspond to the critical current of a dna molecule connected to superconducting nanoparticles and the number of peaks should give the number of nanoparticles connected to the superconducting dna molecule . in our samples",
    "the number of peaks varies from @xmath53 to @xmath54 ( sample from fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnadvdi4].b and fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnadvdi4].a respectively ) . by dividing the average length of the gap by the number of connected nanoparticles",
    ", we can estimate the typical length of the individual dna segments that connect neighboring nanoparticles ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dnadrawnano ] for a sketch of the geometry ) . for a gap width of approximately @xmath11",
    ", we find that this length scale varies from @xmath55 to @xmath56 . *",
    "* 2 . * in the opposite limit , we can assume that there are only two connected nanoparticles per superconducting molecule . under this assumption",
    "the number of peaks gives the number of superconducting molecules .",
    "the transport in dna molecules in this configuration is typically probed on a length scale corresponding to half of the gap width : @xmath57 .    in conclusion",
    "the conductivity of dna molecules is probed on a length scale between @xmath58 and @xmath57 which is smaller than the width of the insulating gap which is around @xmath11 wide .",
    "we note that transport in dna on a @xmath59 scale was reported by several independent groups for e.g. @xcite .",
    "the topography characterization of the gaps etched by fib was already exposed in section  [ chap : fib ] and we will start this characterization section by describing the scanning electron microscope ( sem ) images of our gaps .",
    "sem provides a strong contrast between insulators and metals , whereas afm in tapping mode is only sensible to topography .",
    "hence sem is a good technique to detect metallic residues inside the gap where the topography is rough after fib etching .",
    "note that no careful sem analysis of the gaps was done in the previous experiments @xcite , however it is very likely that the gaps used in these experiments had a similar structure specially in @xcite where they were also fabricated by fib .",
    "several sem images of the fib gaps are displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : dnasem ] , intriguingly in all the images metallic contamination is present in the gap after etching .",
    "two possible limit situations seem to emerge from our observations . in the case where the fib dose is weak",
    "the metallic residues take the form of filaments ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dnasem ] right panel ) whereas after a stronger dose the residues seem to form an ordered network of nanoparticles ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dnasem ] left panel ) .",
    "this transition may be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig : dnasem].f , where two neighbor regions were etched with different fib doses under the same beam conditions . in the narrow trench filaments can be clearly distinguished ( see also figs .  [",
    "fig : dnasem].d , e ) while in the wider trench where the dose was stronger residues form individual nanoparticles .",
    "naturally one can expect the residues to disappear after a sufficient fib dose .",
    "this dose however seems difficult to attain in practice .",
    "this difficulty is illustrated on figs .",
    "[ fig : dnasem].a , b . in the first figure",
    "two intersecting regions were etched with fib ( they are highlighted by blue and green lines ) .",
    "both regions were exposed to a dose sufficient to etch most of the metallic film leaving isolated nanoparticles inside the gap .",
    "surprisingly the density of nanoparticles does not decrease in the intersection between these two regions ( parallelogram with edges formed by blue and green lines ) even if the intersection area received a dose about two times larger than the other regions .",
    "a similar situation is observed on fig .",
    "[ fig : dnasem].b , where a large area was etched by fib irradiation around a slit cut by fib ( delimited by the parallel green lines ) .",
    "the region inside the slit still contains nanoparticles even if it received twice an irradiation dose capable of etching most of the platinum film . as a result the dose needed to completely etch all metallic residues , is certainly much larger than the minimal dose required to create an insulating slit .",
    "the presence of nanoparticles has two possible origins , an instability of the gallium tip that can start to emit small nanoparticles instead of individual gallium ions and the recombination of the gallium atoms on the mica surface ( the latter mechanism is then specific to mica since it is not observed on @xmath60 ) .",
    "our observations suggests that both mechanisms are possible . on one sample",
    "we have detected nanoparticles everywhere inside a large square area corresponding to the scan size of the fib ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : nanopart ] ) .",
    "this proves that in some uncontrolled regime fib is capable of disseminating small nanoparticle instead of individual gallium ions .",
    "the above behavior was observed on only a single sample , however this was the sample that we studied at low temperature in section [ chap : dnatransport ] , hence this rather special case is very important for the interpretation of our transport measurements . in other samples",
    "nanoparticles were observed only inside the gap indicating a different origin . it may be possible that gallium atoms recombine on the mica surface to form nanoparticles .",
    "note that a similar behavior has been observed on gaas substrates @xcite and the presence of aluminum atoms in mica substrate may play a role .",
    "the atomic force microscopy measurements on the edge of the fib scan window depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : nanopart ] , revealed another source of contamination .",
    "a step of @xmath61 height systematically surrounded the fib scan window , this contamination layer is probably composed of carbon deposited during fib imaging of the gaps ( similarly to a contamination layer deposited under sem ) .",
    "this is actually very discouraging because the fib technology was chosen because it supposedly limited contamination . in reality",
    "the electrodes are covered by a poorly characterized carbon contamination layer . as a side consequence",
    "this makes the debate on platinum versus platinum carbon electrodes not pertinent near the slits .",
    "we will now summarize the different contamination sources that were revealed through sem and tapping mode afm microscopy . on mica substrate it seems that metal residues are always present inside the gap ( at least for practically reasonable fib doses ) .",
    "they can take the form of narrow filaments for low fib doses or a net of nanoparticles at high doses .",
    "an exceptional regime can also occur where the gallium tip of the fib becomes unstable and starts to stew nanoparticles everywhere in its scan area . from our experiments",
    "this case seems rather improbable however it occurred at least once , on the sample that we measured at low temperatures .",
    "finally a carbon contamination layer is deposited near the gap during the imaging inside the fib microscope .",
    "keeping in mind the above information , we will now focus on the detection of dna molecules across the gaps where conduction was observed after deposition of dna molecules .    in previous experiments @xcite dna molecules crossing fib slits",
    "could be detected with tapping mode afm .",
    "however afm and low temperature transport measurements were done independently , and probably on different samples while we know that fluctuations are very strong from one sample to another .",
    "thus the correlation between the presence of dna molecule and the appearance of electronic transport was supported only by a statistical argument ( absence of conduction on control samples when a buffer solution without dna was deposited ) .",
    "here we tried to detect dna molecules on the three samples where conduction was induced after the deposition of dna molecules with the pentylamine technique was attempted .",
    "we will start with two samples where conduction was destroyed during the attempts to contact the samples electrically ( see section[chap : dnatransport ] ) . in one of the samples dna molecules",
    "could be observed both in the region far from the gaps where ptc was clean and inside the area covered by the carbon contamination film near the gap as illustrated on fig .",
    "[ fig : box3b ] . on this sample",
    "we could confirm the presence of dna on some of the conducting slits .",
    "it was however impossible to make a complete statistic because after the electrical conduction was destroyed we tried to recover the conduction by keeping the sample in a humid atmosphere for a couple of days .",
    "this procedure did not restore the conductivity but it led to the formation of unidentified `` contamination pancakes '' on the sample surface which impeded further afm characterization .    in the next samples ( dnabox3a ) were taken after silver paint and ultrasound bonding that destroyed conductivity across the slits .",
    "the experiments were done in this order because priority was given to transport measurements over afm characterization and we were afraid that the afm tip could damage conducting dna molecules when scanning .",
    "hence only the previous sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig : box3b ] , dnabox3b ) , was well characterized before transport measurements .",
    "however the fluctuations between the samples were strong and fig .",
    "[ fig : box3a ] revealed a different behavior from sample dnabox3b .",
    "many combed @xmath0 molecules could be observed far from the thin fib slits outside the carbon contamination layer . near the slits however the surface was very different , it included small holes around 3 nanometers deep and no visible dna molecules .",
    "the absence of dna molecules near the gap inside the carbon contamination layer , was observed for at least two other samples , including the sample dnabox2b where electron transport was investigated in section  [ chap : dnatransport ] .",
    "the situation on this sample is depicted on fig .",
    "[ fig : box2b ] , far from the gap the surface is clean .",
    "the region near the slit is covered with nanoparticles ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : nanopart ] ) but the apparent density of dna molecules seems very low . on the one hand the fact that we do not observe dna molecules does not prove that they are completely absent in the gap .",
    "imaging conditions could be spoiled because of the presence of nanoparticles / holes in the contamination layer .",
    "we note that further afm characterization , performed by dmitry klinov using a sharper tip revealed some molecules crossing the fib slits ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : box2bdima ] ) , which supports this hypothesis . on the other hand ,",
    "it is also possible that the presence of a fib contamination layer reduces significantly the efficiency of the pentylamine plasma .",
    "this claim may seem strange since the experiments described in section  [ chap : dnacomb ] demonstrate that pentylamine is a reliable technique to attach dna on metallic electrodes with a sufficient quantity of carbon atoms on the surface .",
    "the above description apriori apply to the fib contamination layer .",
    "a hint on why this argument can fail , is provided by the insitu transport measurements inside the fib chamber . as mentioned in section  [ chap : fib ] the resistance generally decreased slightly at the beginning of the fib etching . probably during this time the deposition of contamination prevailed over etching ,",
    "the drop of resistivity then indicates that the carbon contamination layer is rather conducting and probably locally graphitic .",
    "this claim is supported by the fact that platinum can be used as a chemical vapor deposition ( cvd ) catalyst for the growth of single wall carbon nanotubes @xcite .",
    "a last argument in this direction comes from the differential conductance of the resistive sample on fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnadvdi4 ] which has a cone structure very similar to the density of states in graphene ; it is possible that accidentally the current passed through a flake of few layer graphene in this sample .",
    "since graphite is very stable the available number of carbon atoms that can serve to anchor the pentylamine plasma can be greatly reduced compared to the situation where for example , the surface is covered with amorphous carbon .",
    "this can make the pentylamine film less stable on the surface so that sometimes it is removed when the sample is dried in a scenario similar to that described for mica in section  [ chap : dnacomb ] .",
    "the holes observed on fig .",
    "[ fig : box3a ] give a cue in this direction since they show that a layer at least @xmath62 thick was partially removed from the surface .    to summarize even if dna molecules were detected across some conducting slits , it was not possible to establish a clear correlation between conductivity and the presence of dna molecules on the basis of our afm measurements .",
    "the major obstacle comes from the contamination layer deposited by fib around the slits . due to this layer dna deposition near the gap",
    "does not take place in the same conditions as everywhere else on the clean ptc surface and the density of dna molecules seems reduced near the gap on several samples .",
    "we have argued that the pentylamine layer may not be stable enough because the carbon layer deposited by fib is partially graphitic and provides few fixation points .",
    "this hypothesis also gives an interpretation for the transport data on the resistive sample from section  [ chap : dnatransport ] ( fig .",
    "[ fig : figdnadvdi4].d ) where a graphene / dna junction may incidentally have been formed .",
    "we now turn our attention to the last characterization issue of this section .",
    "the pentylamine plasma creates a positively charged organic layer that allows to bind dna molecules onto the electrodes .",
    "this layer is believed to permit a favorable interaction regime between molecules and the substrate where dna can be conducting @xcite .",
    "however if this layer is continuous it forms an insulating separation between dna on top of the layer and electrodes at the bottom . in a few samples we have noticed holes after deposition of dna on",
    "the pentylamine treated surface . nevertheless in the majority of cases",
    "the surface remained smooth even after deposition of pentylamine and dna molecules with a roughness similar to that of the clean platinum / carbon surface .",
    "we suspect that holes appear when pentylamine is not stable enough on the surface and partially desorbs in the buffer during the deposition of dna . from this point of view the depth of the holes",
    "gives an estimation of the pentylamine film thickness .",
    "in the two cases displayed on fig .  [",
    "fig : box3a].d and fig .",
    "[ fig : box3a].f this depth is respectively 3 and 1 .",
    "these values support the picture of a continuous insulating layer and cast doubt on the possibility of an electrical contact between dna and electrodes in presence of pentylamine .",
    "note that these values in the range of a few nanometers , are even smaller than those measured in ref .",
    "@xcite where a different plasma functionalization was used to deposit a positively charged organic layer .",
    "plasma discharges are even used industrially to grow silicon nitrate when both ammonia and silane are present in the discharge chamber with a typical growth rate of @xmath63 @xcite . in view of the above data , our estimates for the thickness of the pentlyamine film",
    "are very plausible .    in order to determine experimentally whether electrical contact between dna and electrodes is possible in our samples",
    "we have carried on conducting afm experiments at the institute for electronics , microelectronics and nanotechnology ( lille , france ) in the group of d. vuillaume .",
    "when we performed conducting afm scans over the ptc electrodes no current was detected between the tip with a typical bias of @xmath46 and the grounded sample electrodes .",
    "the absence of current is probably due to the insulating pentylamine layer between the tip and the electrode surface . to check whether the absence of conduction was due to the insulating pentylamine layer , we scratched the surface in contact mode until conduction appeared probably removing the pentylamine on top of the electrode surface .",
    "once a finite current appeared we switched back to tapping afm mode and scanned the surface over a wider area .",
    "an afm image obtained during the described experiment is presented on fig .",
    "[ fig : lille].b .",
    "a hole roughly @xmath64 deep was drilled in the region where the substrate was scratched until conductivity appeared .",
    "probably this value provides a measurement of the pentylamine film thickness which in this case also is in the range of a few nanometers .",
    "conducting afm data in the bulk of the electrodes indicate that it is very difficult to establish an electrical contact between dna molecules and the electrodes beneath probably because of the presence of the pentylamine layer . on the edge of the fib slits",
    "however the situation is different . a comparison between conduction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lille].c ) and topography ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lille].d ) images in the region of a slit shows that the edge of the gap are not covered by the insulating film and contact is possible in this region .",
    "the above images were recorded on a slit from the sample where low temperature conduction properties were investigated in section  [ chap : dnatransport ] .",
    "they also give a clue on why inverse proximity effect does not occur in the conduction model from fig .",
    "[ fig : dnadrawnano ] where dna becomes superconducting due to nanoparticles of diameter @xmath59 although it is deposited on normal electrodes .",
    "indeed even if the molecule rests almost entirely over the normal electrodes , electrical contact can be established only in a region of a few nanometers near the gap .",
    "we first summarize the experimental results obtained in the previous sections .    *",
    "* section  [ chap : dnamica ] * describes the @xmath0 dna solution that was used in all our dna deposition experiments and showed that it yields satisfactory deposition onto mica . * * section  [ chap : metal ] * shows that binding through dna extremities allows to deposit molecules on a metallic platinum substrate .",
    "no conduction was observed in this case , in agreement with most of other works . *",
    "* section  [ chap : pentylamine ] * describes the pentylamine plasma functionalization for the adsorption of dna molecules .",
    "we argued that this technique is reliable only on carbon coated surfaces .",
    "when it is applied on mica the pentylamine layer is probably removed at the last step when the sample is dried explaining the absence of dna molecules on the surface . * * section  [ chap : dnacomb ] * we demonstrated that reliable combing of dna molecules across insulating slits can be achieved combining pentylamine and rinsing in a steady flow of water .",
    "however the samples we prepared with this technique exhibited insulating behavior for both samples prepared by electron beam lithography and ion beam etching . a possible reason for",
    "the absence of conductivity may be that a thin layer of amorphous carbon was evaporated at the last step just before deposition of pentylamine and dna molecules . while it ensured a good adhesion of pentylamine it could render the edges of the gap insulating by stabilizing the pentylamine even there ( see section[chap : fibafmsem ] ) .",
    "conducting atomic force microscopy ( afm ) measurements could have shown if this explanation is true . *",
    "* section  [ chap : fib ] * explains how the gaps for deposition of dna were fabricated using in situ resistance measurements inside the focused ion beam microscope ( fib ) .",
    "afm topography of the gaps is also discussed .",
    "starting from this section deposition of dna molecules was done by d. klinov . *",
    "* section  [ chap : dnatransport ] * describes electrical transport measurements in the low temperature regime on samples where conduction was established after the deposition of dna molecules . on four samples superconductivity",
    "was observed whereas a last resistive sample had a differential conductance similar to graphene . due to high critical magnetic fields around @xmath24 we interpreted the observed superconductivity as proximity effect from superconducting nanoparticles inside the fib slit . on a control sample where a short circuit was formed by stopping fib etching before the sample became insulating no superconductivity was observed .",
    "however a zero bias anomaly was observed , possibly due to the formation of conducting nanofilaments in the gap during the fib etching .",
    "scanning electron microscope images of the filaments that may be formed are shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : dnasem ] . * * section  [ chap : fibafmsem ] * showed scanning electron microscope ( sem ) and afm images of the gaps .",
    "metallic nanoparticles were identified on the sample from section  [ chap : dnatransport ] , they appeared because fib worked in a special regime on this sample where it disseminated ga nanoparticles everywhere .",
    "on other samples , both metallic filaments and nanoparticles were observed inside the gap .",
    "afm characterization revealed that a carbon contamination layer was deposited by fib around the gap .",
    "we conjectured that this contamination layer was partially graphitic , this probably explains the poor reproducibility of deposition near the slits while good reproducibility was achieved in section  [ chap : dnacomb ] .",
    "this conjecture also gives insight on the origin of the `` graphitic '' sample that we measured in section  [ chap : dnatransport ] .",
    "due to the limits of afm resolution on the rough surface of the electrodes , we could not reach a definite conclusion on the presence of dna molecules around the gaps .",
    "figure  [ fig : box2bdima ] shows a few molecules in this region , however dna was absent in most of our afm images . finally both tapping and conducting mode afm indicate that pentylamine forms an insulating film of a few nanometers on top of the electrode surface .",
    "the electrical contact between dna and electrodes seems possible only at the edges of the slit were conduction was observed in conducting mode afm .    in conclusion ,",
    "several arguments can be retained to demonstrate that long range transport across dna molecules was observed in our experiments .",
    "the first argument is statistical , for transport was not observed after deposition of a buffer solution without dna . however one must be cautious with statistical arguments in these systems where sample to sample fluctuations are large .",
    "we note that the conduction in our samples was systematically destroyed when attempts to bond the samples were made even when silver paint was used to avoid uncontrolled voltage spikes across the slits",
    ". this observation would be difficult to explain if conduction occured through metalic fillaments only , and suggests a denaturation of the dna molecules by the solvent from the silver paint .",
    "conduction was also destroyed by uv irradiation with wavelength @xmath65 , however this experiment was performed on only a single sample and more statistics and better control of irradiation doses are needed .",
    "concerning the low temperature transport data , the observed proximity effect suggests that transport takes place across a nanowire with a very small density of states .",
    "it is tempting to conclude from this argument that transport indeed takes place along dna molecules .",
    "however here also caution is required since we have shown that fib can create narrow conducting filaments inside the slits whose properties are not well characterized ( for e.g. they seem to exhibit dynamical coulomb blockade ) . ultimately one must keep in mind that even if the gaps are about @xmath11 wide on average , transport may actually be probed on a much shorter length - scales around @xmath59 due to the presence of metallic residues . to summarize our experiments provide indications that long range transport in dna molecules can be achieved through interaction with a disconnected array of metallic nanoparticles ,",
    "however more systematic investigations are needed to determine the largest lengthscales on which transport can be achieved in this way .",

    "<S> we report in detail our experiments on the conduction of @xmath0 dna molecules over a wide range of temperature deposited across slits in a few nanometers thick platinum film . </S>",
    "<S> these insulating slits were fabricated using focused ion beam etching and characterized extensively using near field and electron microscopy . </S>",
    "<S> this characterization revealed the presence of metallic ga nanoparticles inside the slits , as a result of the ion etching . </S>",
    "<S> after deposition of @xmath0 dna molecules , using a protocol that we describe in detail , some of the slits became conducting and exhibited superconducting fluctuations at low temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the observed conduction was due to transport along dna molecules , that interacted with the ga nanoparticles present in the slit . at low temperatures when ga becomes superconducting , induced superconductivity could therefore be observed . </S>",
    "<S> these results indicate that minute metallic particles can easily transfer charge carriers to attached dna molecules and provide a possible reconciliation between apparently contradictory previous experimental results concerning the length over which dna molecules can conduct electricity .    </S>",
    "<S> dna is a double stranded molecule , with diameter 2 nanometer and length that can vary from a few nanometers to centimeters for mammal dna . </S>",
    "<S> it is rather stiff compared to other polymers and polyelectrolytes with a persistence length of @xmath1 nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> dna has a double helix structure , each strand contains four possible bases : adenine ( abbreviated a ) , cytosine ( c ) , guanine ( g ) and thymine ( t ) . </S>",
    "<S> the bases c - g and a - t are paired through hydrogen - bonds and appear on complementary strands of the double helix . </S>",
    "<S> the backbone of dna is formed by sugar and negatively charged phosphate groups . in solution , </S>",
    "<S> these charged groups are surrounded by a cloud of positively charged counter - ions which screens part of the negative charge . as a result </S>",
    "<S> the effective charge of dna in solution is still negative with average charge density @xmath2 instead of @xmath3 for the bare chemical charge . </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath4 is the bjerrum length in water at room temperature ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the possibility of electronic transport through dna molecules is motivated by the existence of an overlap between @xmath5 orbitals between bases stacked along the dna backbone . </S>",
    "<S> the stacking - distance between neighbor basepairs is around @xmath6 @xcite , close to the distance between atomic planes in graphite . </S>",
    "<S> hence the overlap between the molecular orbitals could create delocalized electronic states along the dna chain . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical modeling of electron delocalization along the helix is challenging due to the presence of a complicated environment , where sugar , phosphates , water and counterions play an important role . </S>",
    "<S> most calculations however agree on the presence of a homo ( highest occupied molecular orbital ) - lumo ( lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ) gap of a few @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap between homo / lumo orbitals localized on neighboring basepairs gives an electronic coupling of the order of @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> this value must be compared to the ionization potential between adjacent basepairs which is for example @xmath9 between guanine and thymine @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these values suggest that electronic states are mainly localized on a single basepair . </S>",
    "<S> however this picture can be strongly modified if the molecule is strongly doped / depleted due to interaction with the metallic contacts . </S>",
    "<S> practical interest in conducting dna molecules is related to their self - assembly properties which allow to create nanostructures of a specific shape with a bottom - up approach @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is now possible to manufacture both two dimensional @xcite and three dimensional structures @xcite of well defined shape and chemical properties . </S>",
    "<S> it is also conjectured that conduction inside dna may play a role in dna repair mechanisms , whose efficiency is not well understood yet .    </S>",
    "<S> many experiments were designed to probe transport properties of dna molecules leading to a controversial history that spans across the past decade . </S>",
    "<S> conceptually an experiment to measure conduction of a dna molecule is rather simple ( see fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : dna3d ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless many contradictory behaviors were reported primarily owing to the difficulty of controlling electrode fabrication and the interactions between the molecule and its environment on a substrate .    here </S>",
    "<S> we will give a brief overview of the experiments in the field referring to @xcite for a more thorough review . </S>",
    "<S> one of the first experiments providing direct evidence of electron transport in dna molecules was reported by fink and schnenberger @xcite in 1999 . </S>",
    "<S> previous spectroscopy experiments also showed charge transfer on distances larger than @xmath10 @xcite , however dna resistivity was not measured directly .    </S>",
    "<S> this experiment was followed by @xcite where semiconducting behavior was observed on poly(g)-poly(c ) dna molecules inserted in a platinum nanogap with separation between electrodes around 8 nanometers . </S>",
    "<S> the gap reported in @xcite was in the electron - volt range . </S>",
    "<S> the best conduction properties were reported by a. yu . </S>",
    "<S> kasumov @xcite where conduction was observed at cryogenic temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of the superconducting proximity effect suggested that electron transport could be coherent over distances larger than @xmath11 .    </S>",
    "<S> controversy emerged rapidly after the first experiments indicating transport in dna molecules . the experiment @xcite was heavily criticized in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where conduction was attributed to the formation of a carbon contamination layer under electron beam irradiation . </S>",
    "<S> absence of transport in dna on the @xmath11 scale was reported by several other groups , @xcite for dna on mica and silicon dioxide substrates . </S>",
    "<S> conduction was probed with dc transport , using gold or platinum electrodes @xcite or with electric force microscopy @xcite .    in view of these results </S>",
    "<S> , it appeared that the key ingredient for observation of long range transport in dna molecules @xcite resides in the control of molecule substrate interactions . in the experiment by a. yu . </S>",
    "<S> kasumov _ et . </S>",
    "<S> al_. where conduction could be observed on a 100 scale an organic film ( pentylamine ) was deposited onto the substrate before the deposition of dna and separated molecules from the insulator / electrode surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the key role of the organic film was confirmed in electrostatic mode afm charge delocalization experiments @xcite but direct conduction measurements failed at detecting long range conduction @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recently several experiments observed conduction of short fragments of dna ( with length of a few nanometers ) . by repeatedly forming dna junctions in aqueous buffer solution @xcite concluded that resistance was proportional to the molecule length for poly(g)-poly(c ) whereas insertion of a - t bases led to an exponential decrease of conductance with a decay constant of @xmath12 . using a scanning tunnel microscope operating at cryogenic temperatures @xcite determined the excitation spectrum of poly(c)-poly(g ) molecules which exhibited a clear gap further supporting the semiconductor model of dna from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . at last </S>",
    "<S> both biological characterization and transport measurements were combined in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in an experiments where the conduction of a short dna sequence ( 15 basepair or @xmath13 ) could be destroyed / restored by introducing / correcting mismatches in the dna sequence . </S>",
    "<S> notwithstanding these recent advances for short molecules , the ability of dna to transport current on length scales of the order of @xmath11 with rather low resistances around @xmath14 per molecule is still debated .    in order to clarify the regime where dna can transport charge on a relatively long length - scale we have tried to reproduce the experiment from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the description of our experiments will be organized as follow :    * * section  [ chap : dnamica ] : * we describe the buffer solutions we use and deposition of @xmath0-dna onto mica * * section  [ chap : metal ] : * we describe the deposition of @xmath0 dna molecules on pt electrodes , without the pentylamine organic film . in this experiment molecules </S>",
    "<S> are found to be insulating . * </S>",
    "<S> * section  [ chap : pentylamine ] : * we describe deposition of dna molecules on a substrate with pentylamine . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the presence of carbon atoms is necessary to stabilize the pentylamine layer and to bind dna molecules . </S>",
    "<S> * * section  [ chap : dnacomb ] : * we explain how @xmath0 dna molecules can be combed across electrodes functionalized with pentylamine . unfortunately all samples where we deposited pentlyamine / molecules ourselves exhibited insulating behavior . * </S>",
    "<S> * section  [ chap : fib ] : * gives a description of the fabrication of the insulating gaps with a focused ion beam . </S>",
    "<S> starting from this section deposition of dna molecules was done by d. klinov who deposited molecules as in the samples from @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> some of the structures became conducting after deposition of dna molecules by d. klinov . * * section  [ chap : dnatransport ] : * describes transport measurements on the samples where conduction was observed down to low temperatures . * * section  [ chap : fibafmsem ] : * gives an overview of our atomic force microscopy / electron microscopy data on the gaps and investigates the connection between conduction and observation of dna molecules across the slits .    as we mentioned transport in dna molecules </S>",
    "<S> seems strongly dependent on the molecule environment . unfortunately even if very clean bulk materials can now be synthesized , the surface structure and chemistry remain poorly controlled . for these reasons </S>",
    "<S> technological details become very important and may have unforeseen consequences on the surface state of the electrodes . thus in this article </S>",
    "<S> we focuss on our understanding of the fabrication process and on the control of the surface chemistry of the electrodes , as opposed to our previous article @xcite where emphasis was made on the interpretation of the low temperature measurements . </S>"
