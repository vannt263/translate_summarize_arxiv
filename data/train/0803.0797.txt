    "a requirement for renormalizability in qcd allows a cp violating term with a free parameter @xmath1 , thus called the @xmath0 term , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 represent a gluon field strength and its dual , and @xmath5 is a coupling constant of qcd . if the cp invariance is preserved in the strong interaction in nature , @xmath1 must be zero in qcd .",
    "indeed a current experimental bounds of the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) @xcite , @xmath6 and the crude theoretical estimates@xcite , @xmath7 , gives the constraint that @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath1 must be very small or even zero .    in the presence of the electroweak interaction ,",
    "however , the above conclusion on @xmath1 is modified . in the weinberg - salam(ws )",
    "model of the electroweak interaction , the quark mass term generated through yukawa couplings by the spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking is given by @xmath9 with a quark mass matrix @xmath10 and left- and right - handed quark fields @xmath11 . in order to transform the quark mass matrix to a real and diagonal form , u(1 ) as well as su(@xmath12 ) chiral rotations",
    "are necessary , since @xmath10 is non - hermitian in general . through adler - bell - jackiw anomaly , this u(1 ) chiral transformation shifts @xmath1 in eq.([eq : lag_cp ] ) to @xmath13 therefore the experimental bound ( [ eq : dn_exp ] ) on @xmath14 leads to @xmath15 : a subtle cancellation between a parameter in qcd ( @xmath1 ) and a phase of mass matrix in the ws model ( @xmath16 ) should be fulfilled to keep the cp invariance in the strong interaction .",
    "this cancellation seems unnatural and thus a new mechanism must exist to explain the smallness of @xmath17 ( `` strong cp problem '' ) .",
    "a simplest solution to the strong cp problem is that one of quarks is massless , so that we can set @xmath18 by the chiral rotation of this quark without introducing complex phases to other quark masses .",
    "detailed analyses by chpt @xcite or lattice qcd @xcite , however , strongly indicate that up quark has a finite mass ( @xmath19 mev @xcite ) , therefore this solution is excluded . in the peccei - quinn ( pq )",
    "mechanism @xcite , @xmath17 is promoted to a scalar field associated with a new symmetry , called pq symmetry , which is slightly broken by the anomaly .",
    "the spontaneous pq symmetry breaking automatically pick up an unique vacuum , in which @xmath17 vanishes . as a consequence of the symmetry breaking ,",
    "a very light new scalar particle , called axion must exist in this mechanism .",
    "so far the axion , which is also one of the candidates for the cold dark matter , has not been observed yet , and both cosmological observations and accelerator experiments set a very narrow allowed region of the axion mass such that @xmath20 ev @xcite .",
    "an aim of our investigation in this paper is not to propose a new solution to the strong cp problem , but is to establish a reliable way of calculating the nedm in lattice qcd . for small @xmath17 ,",
    "the nedm is proportional to @xmath17 as @xmath21 .",
    "various model calculations @xcite lead to different estimates , ranging that @xmath22 e@xmath23fm , and even its sign has not been determined yet .",
    "the lattice qcd has a potential to calculate @xmath24 non - perturbatively and in a model independent way .",
    "once a method of calculating the nedm is established in lattice qcd for the case of a particular cp violating term given in ( [ eq : lag_cp ] ) , it may become possible to extend nedm calculations to the case of new cp violating terms such as the chromoelectric dipole moment @xcite generated in susy models at high energy@xcite .",
    "lattice calculations of @xmath24 have remained to be notoriously difficult for a long time @xcite . in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we have investigated two methods of calculating @xmath24 in quenched lattice qcd . in the first method @xcite , we have calculated the nedm form factor at non - zero momentum transfer , which becomes the nedm in the limit of zero momentum transfer . in the second method",
    ", the nedm has been directly extracted from the energy shift in the presence of the external electric field . in both cases ,",
    "we have successfully obtained non - zero signals of edm for neutron and proton . in this paper",
    "we extend the calculation of the nedm to the case of 2-flavor full qcd , using configurations generated by the cp - pacs collaboration @xcite .",
    "we employ the second method , the direct calculation of the nedm with the external electric field , since no extrapolation of momentum transfer is needed , as opposed to the form factor method .",
    "this method , however , requires a large number of configurations to reduce statistical errors . performing calculations at four different quark masses , we discuss a quark mass dependence of the nedm in full qcd .",
    "in particular it is interesting to see whether the nedm vanishes or not at zero quark mass as theoretically predicted .",
    "there exists a previous study of the nedm in lattice qcd with 2-flavor dynamical domain - wall quarks using the form factor method @xcite .",
    "unfortunately the signal of the nedm is consistent with zero within a large error , so that only an upper bound is obtained for a value of @xmath24 .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sec:2 ] , we give a definition of nedm in the presence of uniform and static electric field .",
    "we then consider how this external electric field is introduced on the lattice , and discuss a violation of uniformity of the electric field due to boundaries of the finite lattice .",
    "we also explain our method of extracting the nedm from the nucleon propagator . in sec.[sec:3 ] , simulation parameters for dynamical configurations are briefly summarized .",
    "our main results are given in sec.[sec:4 ] .",
    "summary and discussions of this paper are presented in sec.[sec:5 ] . in this paper we set @xmath25 unless necessary .",
    "in the presence of the constant and uniform electric field @xmath26 , a change of energy for the nucleon state due to the @xmath0 term is denoted as @xmath27 with the nucleon spin vector @xmath28 .",
    "this leads to the following extraction of @xmath24 for @xmath29 : @xmath30 where @xmath31 is an energy of the nucleon state with @xmath32 in the presence of the electric field @xmath29 .",
    "hereafter we simply denote @xmath24 as @xmath14 .      on the lattice , an external electric field @xmath33",
    "is introduced into link variables via a replacement in the wilson - dirac operator with @xmath34 where @xmath35 is an electric charge of a quark flavor @xmath36 .",
    "note here that a complex factor @xmath37 does not appears in the exponent since @xmath33 is defined in the `` minkowski '' space while @xmath38 is the time coordinate of the `` euclidean '' lattice , and therefore @xmath39 is no more unitary .",
    "becomes real in the lattice calculation , so that it can be extracted from the ratio nucleon propagators between spin - up and spin - down@xcite .",
    "] in our calculation we have made this replacement of the link variables only for the valence quark @xcite , while gauge configurations have been already generated without this replacement in the quark determinant .",
    "this `` approximation '' is equivalent to ignoring the `` disconnected '' contribution from the electric field .",
    "it is noted that , at the first order of the electric field , this contribution vanishes for the 3 flavor qcd with @xmath40 , since the disconnected contribution does note depend on the quark flavor in the flavor su(3 ) limit , and therefore is proportional to @xmath41 after summing over 3 flavors .    as discussed in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the introduction of the `` minkowski '' electric filed destroys the periodic boundary condition of link variable @xmath42 , so that translational invariance of the electric field is violated at the temporal boundary .",
    "indeed an effective electric fields , defined by @xmath43 with @xmath44 , becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 runs from 1 to @xmath47 , so that @xmath48 is equal to @xmath49 .",
    "a strong anti - electric field is generated between @xmath50 and @xmath51 in order to cancel the constant electric field @xmath33 , so that @xmath52 vanishes .",
    "we denote the place where the large gap exist as @xmath53 , and @xmath54 in the above case .",
    "since the definition of the nedm in ( [ eq : energydiff ] ) requires the constant electric field , the nedm should only be measured far away form the boundary to avoid an effect of the anti - electric field . in this work",
    "we keep distances between source / sink points and the boundary as large as possible .",
    "in particular we fix @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the time coordinate of the source point .    in the previous study @xcite we found that the good sampling of the topological charge is important for obtaining the reliable signal of nedm .",
    "at least an order of a few thousands configurations was needed to realize the symmetric and gaussian distribution in quenched qcd . on the other hand ,",
    "a number of full qcd configurations in this study is limited to @xmath57 at each quark mass .",
    "we therefore use several source points for each configuration to increase statistics . in accordance with the change of the source point",
    ", we shift the boundary point , keeping the distance between the source point and the boundary as large as possible , to avoid the boundary effect mentioned above .      in the presence of the electric field @xmath26 and the cp violating @xmath0 term , the explicit form of the nucleon propagator becomes @xmath58_{\\alpha\\beta } + \\cdots , \\label{eq : nn_with_e}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with an overall amplitude @xmath59 , a coefficient @xmath60 and an energy @xmath61 .",

    "in our calculation , we employ 2-flavor dynamical qcd configurations , generated by cp - pacs collaboration @xcite with the rg - improved ( iwasaki ) gauge action and the clover quark action on @xmath75 lattice at @xmath76 .",

    "the valence quark mass is chosen to be same with the sea quark mass .",

    "are estimated by the jack - knife method , whose bin size is 5 configurations , equivalent to 25 hmc trajectories .",
    "we employ a local sink and a smeared source for all three quark propagators in the nucleon 2-pt function , with the exponential smearing , @xmath83 .",
    "parameters @xmath84 depend on the quark mass as shown in table [ tab : lat_param ] .",
    "we take 16 different source points separated by 3 lattice units in temporal direction and maximally separated in spatial directions . averaging these source points , a total number of statistics is more than 10,000 .    throughout our study ,",
    "the value of electric field and @xmath0 are fixed to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which are the most suitable choice to reduce statistical errors @xcite .",
    "we measure the topological charge of each configuration after 50 cooling steps , using the @xmath87 improved definition of the topological charge density given by @xmath88        + 2a_1{\\rm tr}[l^{1\\times 2}_{\\mu\\nu}l^{1\\times 2}_{\\alpha\\beta } ] \\right )    \\label{eq : q_def}\\ ] ] with @xmath89 and @xmath90 @xcite , where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are @xmath93 and @xmath94 wilson loops , respectively .",
    "we show the time history of the topological charge in fig.[fig : top ] and its histogram in fig.[fig : hist ] at four quark masses .",
    "the distributions of the topological charge is more or less gaussian at all quark masses . as the sea quark mass decreases , the width of the gaussian distribution becomes narrower in accordance with the theoretical expectation .",
    "the effective mass of the nucleon at four quark masses is plotted in fig.[fig : nmass ] .",
    "the average over 16 sources gives enough statistics to produce a clear plateau at all cases .",
    "we see that the plateau for the nucleon state starts at @xmath95 .",
    "the global fit of the propagator from @xmath96 @xmath97 to @xmath98 gives a value of the nucleon mass with a very small error , as shown in table [ tab : lat_param ] .      in the previous study we found that the influence due to the gap of the electric field on the edm signal disappears at @xmath99 at @xmath100 fm in quenched qcd @xcite .",
    "since we fix @xmath101 in this study , the above condition is well satisfied . in this set up ,",
    "the backward propagation of the nucleon becomes identical to the forward propagation in the infinite statistics , so that we can take an average over both to increase statistics . in fig.[fig : r_rev ] , we compare the time dependence of @xmath69 between forward and backward propagation for neutron and proton .",
    "we have found that two results marginally agree with each other at @xmath102 .",
    "here we consider that the difference at @xmath103 is caused by the statistical noises , and thus the signal of edm is obtained only at @xmath102 .",
    "therefore a fitting range should be chosen as @xmath104 . since @xmath105 ,",
    "the distance between the gap and the end - point of the fitting ranged at @xmath106 , is much larger than @xmath107 , the gap of the electric field does not affect the edm signal .    in fig.[fig :",
    "r_k01357]-[fig : r_k01382 ] , the time dependence of @xmath69 with @xmath108 is plotted for the neutron and proton at each quark mass . at all quark masses , the signal for non - zero edm can be seen at @xmath104 , and the signal changes its sign as @xmath109 does . to estimate the size of nucleon edm , we consider an effective mass of @xmath110 defined in eq.([eq : eff_r ] ) , and plot it in fig.[fig : reff_k01357]-[fig : reff_k01382 ] .",
    "although errors and fluctuations are large , non - zero signals for both proton and neutron edm have been observed in full qcd simulations for the first time . by fitting @xmath110 with an exponential function in eq.([eq :",
    "r_corr_def ] ) at @xmath104 , we obtain the value of @xmath24 , which is given in table [ tab : edm ] .",
    "signs of edm are opposite between proton and neutron .",
    "this agrees with the quenched result @xcite and with the chpt prediction @xcite .      in fig.[fig :",
    "dn_mass ] , @xmath14 for neutron and proton are plotted as a function of pion mass squared , @xmath111 , together with the quenched results .",
    "unfortunately , because of large statistical errors in full qcd results , it is hard to observe a difference from the quenched results . compared with the model calculation @xcite ,",
    "the central value is 10 times larger although its errors are large .    mass dependence of @xmath14 in full qcd does not show the expected decrease toward the chiral limit .",
    "there are several possible explanations .",
    "firstly , large statistical errors might hide the actual decrease of @xmath14 toward the chiral limit .",
    "secondly , the quark mass in this full qcd simulation is still too heavy to see the decrease .",
    "thirdly , @xmath14 does not vanish in the chiral limit due to the lattice artifact that the chiral symmetry is explicitly broken in the wilson - type quark action .",
    "indeed the topological susceptibility , which is also theoretically expected to vanish in the chiral limit , does not show the decrease in full qcd configurations of this paper@xcite . in fig.[fig :",
    "dn_q ] , @xmath14 is plotted as a function of the topological susceptibility instead of the pion mass squared .",
    "contrary to the case of the pion mass squared , the change of the topological susceptibility is too little to observe a possible decrease of @xmath14 with large statistical errors .",
    "this suggests that the combination of the 2nd and 3rd possibilities is a main reason for the mass dependence of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn_mass ] .",
    "we also present the results of the mass dependence for the nucleon cp - odd phase factor in full qcd calculation .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , the next - leading term in the nucleon spinor structure contains additional phase factor @xmath112 , which arises from @xmath113 , as @xmath114 where @xmath115 denotes the nucleon momentum , amplitude and energy , respectively .",
    "this factor should goes to zero toward the massless limit because of the same reason as nedm does . in fig .",
    "[ fig : f_n ] , @xmath116 in full qcd is plotted as a function of @xmath111 , together with the quenched results .",
    "although the statistical errors are not so large compared to the edm results , it does not show the expected decrease toward the chiral limit as well as the edm case .",
    "this observation suggests that it is unlikely that the correct chiral behavior of the edm is hidden in its large statistical errors .",
    "in this paper we present the evaluation of the nedm in full qcd simulation using the external electric field method . after accumulating a huge number of statistics with multiple sources and an average over forward and backward propagation , we have obtained non - zero value of the nucleon edm for the first time in full qcd .",
    "statistical errors of the edm in full qcd are still larger than in the previous quenched case .",
    "the mass dependence of the edm , which is similar to the quenched one , does not show the expected behavior in full qcd that it vanishes towards the chiral limit .",
    "besides the large statistical errors , there may be two main reasons .",
    "one is that sea quark masses used in this paper are still too heavy to see the expected decrease , the other is that the explicit chiral symmetry breaking of the wilson type quark action spoils the expected chiral behavior .",
    "indeed this chiral behavior of the edm is very similar to that of the topological susceptibility .",
    "since it now becomes possible to calculate the edm in full qcd , we should proceed toward the precise evaluation of the nedm .",
    "first of all , we should further decrease the sea quark mass to clearly observe the chiral behavior of edm . as reported in the recent advanced work in pacs - cs collaboration @xcite , @xmath117 flavors",
    "dynamical configurations are being generated at the quark mass close to the physical point , and these configurations will be available soon .",
    "secondly , we should decrease statistical errors of the edm . for this purpose",
    ", it may be better to switch to the form factor method @xcite , though the zero momentum transfer limit has to be taken in this case . from the previous work @xcite and this work",
    ", the good chiral behavior of the quark action seems not so relevant to obtain the signal of the edm , and we are currently calculating the edm form factor using the clover quark action @xcite .",
    "finally the effect of disconnected loop diagram , ignored in our studies , should also be included in the calculation .",
    "a preliminary study shows that it is possible to include this effect with the current available resources @xcite .",

    "<S> we have calculated the neutron electric dipole moment ( nedm ) in the presence of the cp violating @xmath0 term in lattice qcd with 2-flavor dynamical clover quarks , using the external electric field method . </S>",
    "<S> accumulating a large number of statistics by the averages over 16 different source points and over forward and backward nucleon propagators , we have obtained non - zero signals of neutron and proton edm beyond one standard deviation at each quark mass in full qcd . </S>",
    "<S> we have investigated the quark mass dependence of nucleon edm in full qcd , and have found that nucleon edm in full qcd does not decrease toward the chiral limit , as opposed to the theoretical expectation . </S>",
