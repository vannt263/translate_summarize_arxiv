    "in describing bottomonium results at a charm conference , we implicitly invoke heavy quark symmetry . the qcd is supposed to be the same , except that the bottom quark mass is about three times the charm quark mass ,",
    "the magnitude of the electric charge is half as big , and the running strong coupling constant @xmath4 is about 30% smaller .",
    "these differences will affect what portion of the effective potential is explored , how well the non - relativistic approximation works , decay multiplicities , and the number of bound quarkonium states , but the changes should , in principle , be calculable .",

    "you can see that the bottomonium spectrum is richer , with more bound states and a wider variety of decay scenarios .",
    "it is also true that some of the fundamental states , including the ground state , have not yet been observed .",
    "the first @xmath1 states were discovered in hadron collisions , and there is still interesting work being done in bottomonium at the colliders . in particular , d0 has recently measured polarization in hadroproduction of bottomonium . however , jonas rademacker discussed this in detail in his report  @xcite , so i will not cover it here .    direct production of bottomonia in @xmath5 collisions has been a fruitful method for studying their properties .",

    "for two decades , there has been a puzzle in the description of the dipion mass distribution in bottomonium decays , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ olddipion ] .",
    "while the dipion mass distribution for the charmonium transition @xmath6 , and the two bottomonium transitions @xmath7 and @xmath8 are well described by a single term in the matrix element  @xcite , the transition @xmath9 shows a more complicated , two hump structure .",

    "they assume that the complex - valued @xmath15 , @xmath31 , and @xmath20 terms do not vary significantly over the phase space of any of the decays . in the fits",
    "they find that the @xmath20 term is not needed , which is not unexpected because it involves flipping the spin of the heavy @xmath32 quark .",
    "cleo s limit is not very stringent , @xmath33 at 90% confidence level , because the shapes of the @xmath20 and @xmath31 terms are very similar .",

    "the trick is to produce a higher @xmath1 state which decays via a two - pion transition to the @xmath52 .",
    "the experimentalist then uses the two pions to both trigger the detector and to signal the presence of the @xmath52 with the missing mass recoiling against the dipion .",

    "a small peak is visible at the @xmath52 mass in the bottom parts of both figures . in both cases ,",
    "the observed peaking is consistent with what is expected from monte carlo simulations where the decay products of the @xmath1 traveled down the beam line , thus escaping the detector .",
    "both experiments thus set upper limits to the production of invisible particles in @xmath52 decays + @xmath60 `` invisible '' @xmath61 ( belle ) , and + @xmath60 `` invisible '' @xmath62 ( cleo ) . + each of these limits is an order of magnitude better than the previous best limit .",

    "this @xmath66 must have mass less than twice the @xmath32 quark mass , so that it ca nt decay to a pair of @xmath32 quark jets .",
    "this proposal explains the failure of the lep experiments to see the higgs at masses up to 100 gev , since the daughters of the higgs decay ca nt make the b jets those experiments sought .",
    "yet the hypothesis is natural , in the sense that it avoids fine tuning of parameters to explain observations .",
    "the @xmath66 should decay predominantly into @xmath67 if it has enough mass , and should be observable in @xmath68 .",
