    "self - organized criticality ( soc ) is an intriguing concept which started a large ` avalanche ' of research on mechanisms leading to scale invariance in extended dynamical systems @xcite .",
    "however , there is no general agreement about ingredients necessary to create the self - organized critical state .",
    "this fact is reflected in the doubts about whether locally dissipative systems really present soc or have only a very strong divergence of the mean avalanche size @xmath1 when approaching the conservative limit .",
    "the recent results by chabanol and hakin @xcite , brck and grassberger @xcite and kinouchi _ et al . _",
    "@xcite stating that the random - neighbor ofc model is not critical in the dissipative regime and contradicting previous claims @xcite , is a clear example of the difficulty of making such distinction solely on the basis of simulations .",
    "it is also worth remembering that the prototypical sandpile ( btw ) model is not critical in the presence of local dissipation @xcite .",
    "the distinction between conservative / dissipative local dynamics , however , is not what is relevant for predicting critical behavior .",
    "the decisive ingredient seems to be the value of the coupling parameter @xmath2 ( or the nature of the distribution @xmath3 in non - homogeneous systems ) .",
    "for example , the feder and feder model with @xmath4 neighbors is non - conservative but is critical when the coupling constant is equal to @xmath5 @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "a model is proposed which is similar to , but simpler than , the random - neighbor stick - slip models studied in @xcite . for this model , the stationary distribution of states @xmath6 and the mean avalanche size @xmath1 , as functions of the coupling parameter @xmath2 , have simple analytical forms ( in the limit of infinite system size ) .",
    "the analysis in terms of branching processes is transparent and gives a clear mechanism for the emergence of very large but finite @xmath1 in a non - negligible region of the parameter space . in another words , although true criticality occurs only at a special point @xmath0 , there exist a large region where power laws over several decades appear . in this region the behavior of the system",
    "can be considered almost critical .",
    "this occurs because the original parameter which controls the critical behavior ( the branching rate @xmath7 in a branching process ) is now , in soc models , a slow dynamical variable @xmath8 that depends on the coupling parameter @xmath2 . in our model",
    ", the stationary value @xmath9 shows a plateau near the critical value @xmath10 , thus enlarging the region in @xmath2 space where the system displays a critical behavior .",
    "we will say that the system is critical for @xmath11 when @xmath12 and is quasi - critical or almost critical  for values of @xmath2 where @xmath13 .",
    "this fact may be relevant as an explanation for the ubiquity of approximate scale invariance in nature@xcite .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , the model is introduced and the main results obtained .",
    "the issue of robustness in soc models is discussed in sec .",
    "iv contains concluding remarks and suggestions for future work .",
    "the eff model is a random - neighbor version of the feder and feder model @xcite using an extremal dynamics similar to the bak - sneppen model @xcite .",
    "the extremal dynamics , that in this case substitutes ( and plays the same role that ) the slow driving of the original feder and feder model , is here an essential ingredient for the observation of self - organized criticality .",
    "all sites @xmath14 have a continuous state variable @xmath15 . at each time",
    "step the site with maximal value ` fires ' , resetting its value to zero plus a noise term @xmath16 .",
    "then , @xmath4 random ` neighbors ' ( @xmath17 ) of the firing site have their states incremented by a constant @xmath2 plus a noise term .",
    "the choice of neighbors is done at the firing instant : the randomness is _",
    "annealed_. so , denoting the extremal value at instant @xmath18 as @xmath19 , the update rules are : @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 being random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath23 $ ] ( the range of @xmath24 will be discussed later ) . note that each random neighbor receives a different quantity @xmath25 .    consider the instantaneous density of states @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that for any @xmath27 outside the intervals @xmath28,n=1,2,\\ldots $ ] , this density decays to zero for long times .",
    "these intervals effectively discretize the phase space , so it is useful to define the following quantities , @xmath29 with @xmath30 , and @xmath31 so that the intervals do not overlap ( the integer @xmath32 will be obtained later ) .",
    "the process can be thought of as a transference of sites between the intervals @xmath33 . at each time step , one site is transferred to the interval @xmath34 and , with probability @xmath35 , one site is removed from this interval .",
    "the average flux to the intervals @xmath36 with @xmath37 corresponds to the probability @xmath38 that a neighbor is chosen in the previous @xmath39 interval minus the probability @xmath40 that a neighbor is chosen in the interval @xmath36 .",
    "the average number of sites in each interval is @xmath41 . for long times , that is , when the density of states outside the @xmath36 intervals goes to zero , one can write @xmath42 , \\\\ p_n(t+1 ) & = & p_n(t)+\\frac 1n\\left [ kp_{n-1}(t)-kp_n(t)\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , each time step is equal to the update of the maximal site and @xmath4 random neighbors .",
    "the condition for steady states , @xmath43 , gives @xmath44 that is , @xmath45 for all @xmath46 .",
    "but since @xmath47 is normalized , only @xmath48 intervals with @xmath49 of @xmath50 can exist .",
    "that is , @xmath51 giving that @xmath52.this means that @xmath6 is composed of @xmath4 bumps ( @xmath53 ) and the previous condition for producing non - overlapping intervals @xmath36 reads @xmath54 .",
    "there is also a bump of @xmath55 ( by analogy with the results from @xcite ) situated at the interval @xmath56 $ ] .",
    "the other intervals @xmath57 have @xmath49 of yet smaller order ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "an avalanche will be defined as the number of firing sites until an extremal site value falls bellow the threshold @xmath58 @xcite .",
    "note that the first site of an avalanche ( the ` seed ' ) always has @xmath59 but it counts as a firing site .",
    "so , if a seed produces no supra - threshold sites ( ` descendants ' ) , this counts as an avalanche of size one . this definition of avalanches agrees with that used in the studies of relaxation oscillator models .    in these random neighbor models ,",
    "an avalanche can be identified as a branching process where an active site produces @xmath4 new sites , each one having a probability @xmath60 of being active ( a ` branch ' ) and a probability @xmath61 of being inactive ( a ` leaf ' ) .",
    "the branching rate @xmath62 measures the probability that a firing site produces another firing site .",
    "a known result for a process with a constant branching rate @xmath7 is the distribution of avalanche sizes @xcite , @xmath63 which , for large @xmath64 and small @xmath65 has the form @xmath66 we will see that eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) can be applied to the eff model with the stationary value @xmath67 .",
    "now , consider an avalanche which has terminated after @xmath64 sites have fired .",
    "this avalanche is composed of one seed and @xmath68 descendants . but",
    "the average number of descendants produced by @xmath64 firing sites is @xmath69 .",
    "thus , on average , the relation @xmath70 must hold , which leads to @xmath71    of course , this result can be obtained directly from eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) after some work .",
    "note that @xmath72 refers to the stationary value of the branching rate : during the transient , @xmath73 changes with the avalanche time @xmath18 .",
    "although questioned by some authors @xcite , we retain the name _ self - organization _ for this evolution of @xmath74 toward @xmath75 mainly as a label to distinguish these systems from standard branching processes where @xmath76 is fixed _",
    "a priori_.      in the case @xmath77 , the calculation of @xmath78 is trivial .",
    "the @xmath4-th bump , ( @xmath79 ) which starts at @xmath80 , must lie bellow the threshold @xmath81 ( if not , the system is supercritical ) .",
    "then , @xmath82 must satisfy the condition @xmath83 , that is , @xmath84 for the standard @xmath85 neighbor case this reads @xmath86 .",
    "this condition also implies that neighbors pertaining to the other bumps do not contribute to @xmath78 , that is , can not fire when receiving a maximal contribution @xmath87 .",
    "now , since all the neighbors pertaining to the @xmath4-th bump receive at least the quantity @xmath77 , they are always transformed into active sites .",
    "thus , the average number of descendants of a firing site is @xmath88 which corresponds to a critical branching process .",
    "it is known that in this case the system presents an infinite @xmath1 ( see eq .",
    "( [ smed ] ) ) and , for large @xmath64 , a pure power law @xmath89 for the distribution of avalanche sizes @xcite .      for the case",
    "@xmath90 , in order to obtain an expression for @xmath91 , the knowledge of the distribution of states @xmath92 is required .",
    "but it is clear that if @xmath93 then inevitably @xmath94 ( even for very small @xmath95 ) , since some sites pertaining to the @xmath4-th bump may not receive a sufficient contribution to make them active ( see eq .",
    "( [ sig2prime ] ) below ) .",
    "thus , any value @xmath96 is sub - critical .",
    "this is a common feature of many models with soc @xcite .    in our model ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath6 is very simple . in the stationary state ,",
    "a site pertaining to the @xmath46-th bump has energy @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the sum of @xmath46 random variables uniformly distributed in the interval @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "the distribution @xmath100 may be calculated from @xmath101 for the @xmath85 case , @xmath102 with the shorthand @xmath103 .",
    "the distribution @xmath104 has @xmath4 bumps .",
    "each bump ( labeled by @xmath46 ) starts at @xmath105 , being proportional to @xmath100 ( the constant of proportionality is just @xmath106 ) . in fig .  1 ,",
    "the distribution @xmath6 is compared with simulation results for a system with @xmath107 sites , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and a sufficient number of avalanches .    for such large systems",
    ", we must be careful about using reliable random neighbor generators . in order to speed up the search for the extremal site",
    ", we used the binary rooted tree algorithm described by grassberger @xcite .",
    "for example , if the system has @xmath110 sites , a binary tree with @xmath111 levels is created such that , in each node at level @xmath112 , it is stored the largest value of @xmath27 of the two branch nodes of the @xmath113-th level .",
    "so , the @xmath114-th ( root ) level contains the value of the extremal site . ascending the tree",
    ", we locate the position of this site in the upper level . after the extremal site firing",
    ", the tree must be updated .",
    "the same occurs when the random neighbors are updated .",
    "these operations have a complexity @xmath115 instead of the @xmath116 complexity of the naive search mechanism .",
    "the stationary branching rate @xmath78 is calculated as follows .",
    "all the sites that can be activated pertain to the @xmath4-th bump . when hit , sites with @xmath117 are always activated . in terms of the re - scaled variable @xmath118",
    ", this condition refers to sites with @xmath119 .",
    "they contribute to the branching rate with the quantity @xmath120 , @xmath121 where @xmath122 .",
    "sites with @xmath123 can not be activated and do not contribute to @xmath124 .",
    "sites with @xmath125 can be activated if they receive a quantity @xmath126 that is , @xmath127 .",
    "this occurs with probability @xmath128 .",
    "thus , these sites contribute to the branching rate with the quantity @xmath129    the total branching rate is then @xmath130 where we used the fact that @xmath131 . since @xmath132 has a simple piece - wise polynomial form ( see eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) ) the    calculation of @xmath1 is straightforward and the result is presented in fig .  2 along with simulation results for the @xmath85 , @xmath109 , for systems with up to @xmath133 sites .",
    "in fig .  3 , we plot simulation results for the @xmath134 distribution which agree very well with eq .",
    "( [ ps ] ) if @xmath135 is used in that expression .",
    "strong finite size effects , however , are present when @xmath136 .    for @xmath137 , that is , @xmath138 , the form assumed by @xmath139 is particularly simple , since @xmath140 in that interval ( @xmath141 is a numerical constant ) . then , @xmath142 the avalanche cutoff lenght    since @xmath143 , we obtain , from eqs .",
    "(  [ exponent ] ) and  ( [ smed ] ) , the avalanche cutoff size and the average avalanche size @xmath144 with the critical exponent @xmath145 for example , with @xmath85 ( which means @xmath146 , see eq .",
    "( [ pe ] ) ) and @xmath147 , the mean avalanche size is @xmath148 already for @xmath149 .",
    "curiously , this behavior is similar to the @xmath150 divergence found in the standard random neighbor ff model @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to compare the above behavior with that of a simpler eff model @xcite where the firing rule is the same , @xmath151 $ ] , but the coupling between sites is noiseless , @xmath152 .",
    "thus , @xmath153 assumes the form of @xmath4 rectangular bumps with @xmath154 . in this",
    "_ noiseless _ eff model , the branching rate , the cutoff size and the average avalanche size are @xmath155 in contrast with the noisy model , large avalanches only occur when @xmath2 is very close to @xmath156 ( see fig .  2 ) .",
    "thus , the eff model with noiseless couplings does not present an enlargement of the region where the system displays a critical behavior as observed in the noisy eff model .",
    "the idea of self - organized criticality present in the literature embodies two distinct properties .",
    "the term _ critical _ refers to the existence of power laws and to the absence of a characteristic scale in the response of the system to the driving mechanism of the dynamics ; the term _ self - organized _ refers to the fact that there exist a parameter ( @xmath74 ) , which controls the avalanching process , whose value is not fixed _ a priori _ like , for example , in standard percolation and branching processes .",
    "this parameter evolves in time , during a transient phase , toward a stationary value @xmath157 .",
    "indeed , this time dependence should be written as @xmath158 , that is , @xmath159 is a functional of the distribution of states @xmath26 , that , in turn , evolves toward a statistically stationary distribution @xmath92 .",
    "so , @xmath160 . if @xmath161 , the system is critical .",
    "the evolution of @xmath26 toward the steady - state @xmath6 is akin to the transient relaxation in equilibrium systems : any initial condition leads to the same stationary state , thus to the same value of @xmath78 .",
    "however , this robustness to initial conditions and external perturbations on @xmath47 ( ` dynamical stability ' ) should not be mistaken as parameter robustness ( ` structural stability ' ) .",
    "this is a distinct characteristic claimed to be present on some soc models ( see for instance @xcite ) . for a system to have ` structural stable criticality ' , there would be a finite parameter range for which , after the transient , the system is critical . in this case ,",
    "@xmath162 for @xmath2 belonging to some interval @xmath163 $ ] .",
    "that kind of behavior will be also called by us _",
    "generic soc_.    ` structural stability ' is a relative concept which depends on the parameter space physically available for the system .",
    "for example , it is well known that the sandpile model is not critical in the presence of dissipation .",
    "the sandpile dissipation parameter corresponds to the quantity @xmath164 in our model @xcite .",
    "the standard btw model is by definition ` tuned ' into a critical state through the ` imposition ' of a conservation law .",
    "although it could be argued that dissipation is not a natural feature of sandpiles , since sand does not disappear , the appearence of soc in nature would sound much more natural if criticality could be observed over a region of the parameter space , not only in a special point .",
    "generic self - organized criticality is depicted in curve  ( a ) of figure 4 . in this case",
    ", there is a finite range of @xmath2 values for which @xmath165 assumes the critical value @xmath10 . in this figure",
    ", curves ( d ) and ( e ) represent the behavior observed in the btw model and also in the noiseless eff model examined above , for which the system is critical only for a special value of the parameter @xmath2 .",
    "however , there is a third possibility . curves ( b ) and ( c ) represent the behavior of @xmath166 given by eq .",
    "( [ sigtotal ] ) for the eff model with noisy couplings : although the system is critical only at @xmath167 , the system is ` almost critical ' over a large parameter region . this behavior has also been observed in the standard random neighbor versions of ff and ofc models @xcite .",
    "the importance of this characterization is that several models in the soc literature , previously seen as having true generic criticality , are now recognized as having only an almost critical behavior as discussed above .",
    "a model which apparently presents generic soc behavior in coupling space is the two - dimensional ofc model @xcite .",
    "also the standard feder and feder model @xcite is claimed to be critical for @xmath168 @xcite .",
    "looking at the behavior of the models studied so far , we make the following conjecture : a necessary condition for a lattice model to present a generic soc behavior is that its corresponding random neighbor version already presents an enlarged critical region in the sense discussed above",
    ". this could be tested by comparing the 2d versions of the eff and noiseless eff models studied above .    in conclusion , we found that some systems that display soc , although being critical only for a single value for @xmath2 , are almost critical region in a large region of the parameter space .",
    "this almost critical behavior is difficult to be distinguished , in practice , from true generic soc behavior : both in numerical simulations ( huge lattices would have to be used ) and in nature ( due to limitations in the data ) power laws can only be measured over some scale decades @xcite .",
    "so , in order to explain the ubiquity of scale invariance in nature , having a true generic soc or only presenting an enlarged region where the system is almost critical are , as far one can measure , identical .",
    "a class of extremal stick - slip models has been introduced and studied in the @xmath169 limit .",
    "we showed that noise in the couplings of the eff model changes the exponent that controls the amplitude of the critical region from @xmath170 to @xmath171 .",
    "this enlargement of the region where the system displays a critical behavior is similar to that found in the standard random neighbor ofc and ff models @xcite . like in other models ,",
    "the true critical state occurs only for one point in parameter space @xcite , but in practice that fact can hardly be noticed , and the model displays the typical features of generic soc .    in future work",
    "we hope to determine the minimal ingredients for producing the enlargement of the critical region in the models examined in the soc literature .",
    "we will also present results for the two - dimensional case and compare with the standard ofc and ff models .",
    "the simple mechanism devised in this work suggests that , if true generic criticality is not easy to obtain in the space of possible models , this quasi - critical behavior certainly is .",
    "thus , for explaining the robustness of approximate scale invariance in nature , this mechanism seems to be more ",
    "generic  than generic criticality .",
