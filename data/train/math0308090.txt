    "in this note we prove some bounds for the extinction time for the ricci flow on certain @xmath0manifolds .",
    "our interest in this comes from a question that grisha perelman asked the first author at a dinner in new york city on april 25th of 2003 .",
    "his question was `` what happens to the ricci flow on the @xmath0sphere when one starts with an arbitrary metric ?",
    "in particular , does the flow become extinct in finite time ? ''",
    "he then went on to say that one of the difficulties in answering this is that he knew of no good way of constructing minimal surfaces for such a metric in general .",
    "however , there is a natural way of constructing such surfaces and that comes from the min ",
    "max argument where the minimal of all maximal slices of sweep",
    " outs is a minimal surface ; see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "the idea is then to look at how the area of this min ",
    "max surface changes under the flow .",
    "geometrically the area measures a kind of width of the @xmath0manifold and as we will see for certain @xmath0manifolds ( those , like the @xmath0sphere , whose prime decomposition contains no aspherical factors ) the area becomes zero in finite time corresponding to that the solution becomes extinct in finite time .",
    "moreover , we will discuss a possible lower bound for how fast the area becomes zero .",
    "very recently perelman posted a paper ( see @xcite ) answering his original question about finite extinction time .",
    "however , even after the appearance of his paper , then we still think that our slightly different approach may be of interest . in part because it is in some ways geometrically more natural , in part because it also indicates that lower bounds should hold , and in part because it avoids using the curve shortening flow that he simultaneously with the ricci flow needed to invoke and thus our approach is in some respects technically easier .",
    "let @xmath1 be a smooth closed orientable @xmath0manifold and let @xmath2 be a one  parameter family of metrics on @xmath3 evolving by the ricci flow , so @xmath4    unless otherwise stated we will assume throughout that @xmath3 is prime and non  aspherical ( so @xmath5 for some @xmath6 ) . if @xmath3 is prime but not irreducible , then @xmath7 ( proposition @xmath8 in @xcite ) so @xmath9 .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath3 is irreducible , then the sphere theorem implies that @xmath10 ( corollary @xmath11 in @xcite ) . in the second case",
    ", the hurewicz isomorphism theorem then implies that @xmath12 ( since @xmath3 is non  aspherical ) .",
    "therefore , in either case , by suspension , as in lemma @xmath0 of @xcite , the space of maps from @xmath13 to @xmath3 is not simply connected .",
    "fix a continuous map @xmath14 \\to c^0\\cap l_1 ^ 2 ( \\ss^2 , m)$ ] where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are constant maps so that @xmath17 is in the nontrivial homotopy class @xmath18 $ ] .",

    "lemma @xmath23 in @xcite .",
    "sphere a min  max type argument produces an minimal @xmath24sphere .",
    "note that in the definition of the width it plays no role whether the minimal @xmath24sphere is embedded or just immersed , and thus , the analysis involved in this was settled a long time ago . this well  known approach has been considered by many people , including freedman , meeks , pitts , rubinstein , schoen , simon , smith , and yau ; see @xcite . ]",
    "the next theorem gives an upper bound for the derivative of @xmath25 under the ricci flow which forces the solution @xmath2 to become extinct in finite time ( see paragraph 4.4 of @xcite for the precise definition of extinction time when surgery occurs ) .",
    "[ t : upper ] let @xmath1 be a closed orientable prime non  aspherical @xmath0manifold equipped with a riemannian metric @xmath26 . under the ricci flow ,",
    "the width @xmath25 satisfies @xmath27 in the sense of the limsup of forward difference quotients .",
    "hence , @xmath2 must become extinct in finite time .",
    "the @xmath28 in ( [ e : di1a ] ) comes from the gauss  bonnet theorem and the @xmath29 comes from the bound on the minimum of the scalar curvature that the evolution equation implies .",
    "both of these constants matter whereas the constant @xmath30 depends on the initial metric and the actual value is not important .    to see that ( [ e : di1a ] ) implies finite extinction time rewrite ( [ e : di1a ] ) as @xmath31 and integrate to get @xmath32    \\ , .\\ ] ] since @xmath33 by definition and the right hand side of ( [ e : lastaa ] ) would become negative for @xmath34 sufficiently large we get the claim .",
    "arguing as in 1.5 of @xcite ( or alternatively using section [ s:4 ] ) , we get as a corollary of this theorem finite extinction time for the ricci flow on all @xmath0manifolds without aspherical summands .    [ c : upper ] let @xmath1 be a closed orientable @xmath0manifold whose prime decomposition has only non  aspherical factors and is equipped with a riemannian metric @xmath26 . under the ricci flow with surgery , @xmath2 must become extinct in finite time .",
    "part of perelman s interest in the question about finite time extinction comes from the following : if one is interested in geometrization of a homotopy three - sphere ( or , more generally , a three - manifold without aspherical summands ) and knew that the ricci flow became extinct in finite time , then one would not need to analyze what happens to the flow as time goes to infinity .",
    "thus , in particular , one would not need collapsing arguments .",

    "note that branch points only help in the inequality ( [ e : in24 ] ) .",
    "for an immersed minimal surface @xmath35 we set @xmath55 by ( [ e : diffa ] ) and the gauss  bonnet theorem @xmath56 ( note that by the second variational formula ( see , for instance , section 1.7 of @xcite ) , then @xmath57 where @xmath58 . ) recall also that by definition the index of a minimal surface @xmath37 is the number of negative eigenvalues ( counted with multiplicity ) of @xmath59 .",

    "we begin by recalling a result on harmonic maps which gives the existence of minimal spheres realizing the width @xmath63 .",
    "the results of sacks and uhlenbeck give the harmonic maps but potentially allow some loss of energy .",

    "it is implicit in proposition [ p : existence ] that @xmath82 .",
    "this can , for instance , be seen directly using @xcite .",
    "namely , page 125 in @xcite shows that if @xmath83 is sufficiently small ( depending on @xmath65 ) , then @xmath84 is homotopically trivial .    we will also need a standard additional property for the min ",

    "the key for this is the following claim ( the inequality in ( [ e : acomp1 ] ) below ) : given @xmath111 , there exist @xmath89 and @xmath112 so that if @xmath113 and @xmath114 , then @xmath115 \\ , h + \\tilde{c } \\ ,",

    "since the metrics @xmath2 vary smoothly and every sweep  out @xmath84 has uniformly bounded energy , it is easy to see that @xmath127 is a smooth function of @xmath128 with a uniform @xmath129 bound independent of both @xmath130 and @xmath131 near @xmath132 ( cf .",
