    "one of the leading uncertainties in current lattice calculations comes from the renormalization constants necessary to relate the lattice currents to those in some continuum renormalization scheme . until recently ,",
    "the most commonly used method for determining these was 1-loop perturbation theory . in the last few years",
    "a non - perturbative method based on axial and vector ward identities has been developed  @xcite .",
    "this allows the determination of all scale invariant renormalization constants , and all @xmath0 improvement constants for bilinear operators . for the remaining bilinears and four fermion operators that arise in the weak effective hamiltonian , the method of choice uses external quark states in landau gauge  @xcite",
    "this defines the renormalization constants in the ri or mom scheme , in which the value of the renormalized operators is specified at some fixed momentum for the external quarks .    in this talk we present a status report of our calculations using quark states in landau gauge at @xmath1 .",
    "the calculation involves two quantities : the quark propagator , @xmath2 and the three point functions , @xmath3 , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is an element of the clifford algebra , @xmath6 is the fermion field , and we only consider flavor non - singlet operators . in terms of these",
    "we define @xmath7 the ri scheme then corresponds to choosing a momentum @xmath8 ( and mass @xmath9 ) at which the renormalized inverse propagator and the renormalized truncated three point functions have their tree level values : @xmath10 these equations , thus , define the wave function renormalization constant , @xmath11 , the mass renormalization constant , @xmath12 , and the renormalization constants for the bilinears , @xmath13 .",
    "the resulting renormalized quantities are then also the same those in the continuum ri scheme at renormalization scale @xmath14 .",
    "the most common scheme in which phenomenological results are presented is the @xmath15 , which can be obtained from the ri scheme results by a perturbative calculation in the continuum .",
    "however , it is worth noting that the ri scheme does not respect the axial ward identities , and this breaking of the ward identity can not be accounted for in the connection between ri and @xmath15 using perturbation theory  @xcite .",
    "specifically , these identities require that @xmath16 at @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the renormalized mass and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the pseudoscalar and axial bilinears .",
    "fortunately , the derivative terms in these equations , which contribute due to the goldstone pole at zero quark mass arising out of chiral symmetry breaking , become irrelevant when the renormalization scale @xmath21 is large compared to the scale of chiral symmetry breaking  @xcite . on the other hand lattice discretization errors",
    "become large for @xmath22 larger than unity .",
    "thus , the method relies on the existence of an intermediate window in which these two artifacts are small .",
    "in the lattice regularization scheme operators receive power corrections which involve higher dimension operators .",
    "this is a consequence of the hard cutoff , @xmath23 the lattice spacing @xmath24 .",
    "in addition , because the ri scheme is defined in a fixed gauge , gauge - invariant and gauge - dependent operators , in general , mix .",
    "application of brs symmetry shows  @xcite that , at @xmath0 and @xmath25 , the only corrections to @xmath26 are gauge invariant and of the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the dirac operator and this correction vanishes by the equation of motion , @xmath29 .",
    "such a correction term , therefore , does not affect the on - shell matrix elements of these operators , but does contribute to the momentum space correlators in eq .  [ eq : cgamma ] as these involve contributions from points where the operator and the fermion sources overlap .    at @xmath0 only @xmath30 part of @xmath31 contributes to the mixing ; consequently , the scalar density and the vector current mix , as do the axial current and the tensor density . the pseudoscalar current receives only multiplicative corrections at this order . at higher orders ,",
    "the violation of rotational and lorentz symmetries show up , and different components of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 mix amongst themselves .    to take the @xmath0 mixing into account , eq .  [ eq : rencondgam ] is modified to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is determined by the requirement that @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath20 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath20 , and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "unfortunately , as stated above , there is no analogous condition to determine @xmath43 since @xmath44 .",
    "an illustration of the magnitude of the mixing is given in table  [ tab : table1 ] from which the @xmath45 are determined .",
    "similarly , at @xmath0 , the propagator gets corrections @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the gauge - variant and gauge - invariant corrections respectively .",
    "methods to determine a combination of these coefficients have been discussed in ref .",
    "and we do not repeat the discussion here .",
    "our pilot calculation utilizes 60 lattices at @xmath49 which corresponds to a lattice scale of @xmath50  @xcite and a critical hopping parameter @xmath51  @xcite .",
    "the quark propagators were inverted at seven values of @xmath52 , 0.1294 , 0.1308 , 0.1324 , 0.1334 , 0.1343 , and 0.1348 using a clover coefficient value of @xmath53  @xcite . unless stated otherwise",
    ", we shall only consider momenta such that all components are less than @xmath54.-1    the truncated three - point functions were calculated and projected on the clifford basis .",
    "as shown in tab .",
    "[ tab : table1 ] , the data , in addition to the expected terms , shows @xmath0 mixing ( @xmath55 ) , and the two @xmath56 effects : mixing ( @xmath57 ) and the difference between the terms parallel and perpendicular to the momentum .",
    "the latter effect is due to the violation of rotational symmetry .",
    "as mentioned in the previous section , we correct for the @xmath0 mixings by determining the @xmath36 , but , at @xmath58 , the approximately @xmath59 violation of rotational symmetry and @xmath60 mixings due to higher order effects survive .",
    ".the various clifford projections of the truncated 3-point functions corresponding to the scalar and vector bilinears at @xmath61 and @xmath62 . [ cols=\"^,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : table1 ]    to calculate the wave function renormalization ,",
    "we fourier transform the inverse propagator , @xmath63 and calculate the derivative in eq .",
    "[ eq : truncwav ] analytically : @xmath64 we expect large @xmath56 discretization errors for the following reason . at tree level @xmath65 , which deviates from unity by @xmath66 at @xmath58 . to correct for this artifact",
    ", we divide the calculated @xmath67 by this tree - level contribution , and use the resulting @xmath68 in eq .",
    "[ eq : rencondmass ] to calculate @xmath11 .",
    "note that such a determination of @xmath11 contains residual @xmath0 errors stemming from the use of the uncorrected propagator .",
    "in fig .  [ fig : figure1 ] , we show the effect of improvement for the vector current , @xmath23 removing the @xmath0 term by calculating @xmath69 . in the absence of discretization errors , the calculated @xmath70 should be independent of the scale @xmath21 except for non - perturbative terms . non - perturbative terms are expected to fall off as @xmath71 at large @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "instead the uncorrected data shows a linear rise , @xmath70 changing by @xmath72 between @xmath73 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath0 corrected quantity . ]",
    "is constant over this range of @xmath74 .",
    "there is roughly @xmath75 uncertainty in @xmath70 coming from the variation between different lorentz components and different combinations of momenta in this range .",
    "[ fig : figure2 ] shows that the behavior of tensor renormalization constant , @xmath76 , is qualitatively similar : the much smaller linear rise of the unimproved @xmath76 for @xmath77 is removed by the improvement .",
    "finally , we show the behavior of the axial vector channel in fig .",
    "[ fig : figure3 ] .",
    "we do not observe any improvement in @xmath78 and the data do not show a window in which it is independent of @xmath74 .",
    "since we have not finished the analysis , we end with a few qualitative statements .",
    "( i ) the @xmath0 errors induced due to mixing with the equation of motion operators can be corrected for by calculating @xmath36 .",
    "these @xmath36 can then be compared with those evaluated using the axial ward identity  @xcite .",
    "( ii ) at @xmath1 , the presence of non - perturbative corrections forces us to work at @xmath79 or higher to determine the renormalization constants . at these large momenta ,",
    "the @xmath56 errors are only slightly smaller than the @xmath0 errors , and it is important to ascertain whether our attempts to correct the latter introduce unacceptably large @xmath56 errors . in particular , the correction terms in eq .",
    "[ eq : improve ] involve the inverse propagator , and an @xmath0 improvement in the propagator used in this equation changes results at @xmath56 .",
    "the use of a suitably improved propagator would make the @xmath0 correction term vanish in the chiral limit except for non - perturbative effects that fall off as @xmath80 . in practice , as already noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bare inverse propagator has large @xmath81 corrections even in the chiral limit , and hence our improvement term does not vanish there",
