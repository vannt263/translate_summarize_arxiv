    "these are perhaps the most important examples of how green s functions relate to confinement in this formulation .",
    "their infrared behaviour is sensitive to confinement according to the scenarios of kugo and ojima @xcite , and of gribov and zwanziger @xcite . in landau gauge",
    "these scenarios predict an infrared vanishing gluon propagator and an infrared enhanced ghost propagator ( the latter was pointed out in @xcite ; for a review , see @xcite ) .",
    "qualitatively , finite - volume effects are expected to distort the infrared properties of 2-point correlation functions for momenta approaching @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the finite length of the system in the corresponding direction . for pure yang - mills theory",
    "the momentum scale for confinement is set by @xmath2 , which is of the order of 200  400 mev , somewhat dependent on the scheme .",

    "] this implies that for lengths around @xmath4 , of the order @xmath5 ",
    "@xmath6 fm , the finite volume will already have a considerable effect on the infrared behaviour of these confinement - sensitive correlations .",
    "eventually , of course , when further decreasing the volume down to the sub - fermi regime , confinement will be lost altogether .",
    "in present monte - carlo simulations , using lattice landau gauge , the gluon and ghost propagators of pure @xmath7 and @xmath8 gauge theory in four dimensions are obtained in volumes of the order of @xmath9 in length , in some cases even somewhat larger than @xmath9 @xcite . however , despite clear indications in favour of the qualitative infrared behaviour of both the gluon and the ghost propagator , as predicted by continuum studies , some quantitative discrepancies still remain . in particular , apart from some indications from the volume scaling of the zero momentum gluon propagator , a systematic and statistically significant verification of its infrared suppression from lattice data in 4 dimensions is still lacking .    as far as the continuum studies are concerned , on the other hand , we are nowadays in the quite comfortable situation that a variety of different non - perturbative approaches all lead to the same infrared behaviour for the propagators in the infinite volume limit .",
    "these include studies of their dyson - schwinger equations ( dses ) @xcite , of the fokker - planck type diffusion equations of stochastic quantisation @xcite , and of the functional renormalisation group equations ( frges )  @xcite .    in order to understand the origin of the remaining discrepancies observed between the functional methods in the continuum and the lattice landau gauge simulations",
    ", it is an obvious and necessary step forward to adapt the continuum methods to finite volumes .",

    "indeed , the same scale separation was used in the infrared analysis of the functional rges @xcite , where an explicit infrared momentum cut - off @xmath14 is introduced and plays a role analogous to that by the finite volume . in the functional rg infrared - studies it is precisely this regime , @xmath15 , that is required to lead to the same infrared behaviour as in the other functional continuum investigations without such infrared cut - off @xcite . in the available studies of the dses on a symmetric hypertorus ,",
    "on the other hand , this same limit has not been explicitly obtained as yet . in the present work we fill this gap by presenting a refined infrared analysis .",
    "because of the necessary separation of scales ( [ eq : valrange ] ) , the actual lattice sizes @xmath1 necessary to achieve this separation for a sufficiently wide range of momentum values need to be much larger than @xmath9 . from our numerical analysis",
    "we estimate that this might well require lengths @xmath1 of the order of 40 fm , so that reliable lattice determinations of the infrared exponents of the gluon and ghost propagators on reasonably fine lattices are likely to remain unfeasible for some time to come .",
    "corresponding @xmath7 simulations on rather large lattices in three dimensions @xcite confirm this by showing a slow but steady convergence towards the three dimensional infinite volume limit , as predicted by dse studies @xcite .",

    "_ , the definition of the effective exponent for our fits in ( [ gluonfit ] ) , this is when @xmath306 which according to our estimate again requires @xmath307 fm , _ c.f . _ , fig .  [ fig : fit ] , and is thus still relatively far beyond our numerical data to attempt reasonable fits and extrapolations .",
    "we furthermore note that the length scale where the behaviour of the gluon propagator turns from @xmath308 ( infrared diverging ) to @xmath309 ( infrared vanishing ) is of the order of at least @xmath310 fm for model ( 2 ) ( from the infinite volume effective exponent ) up to @xmath311 for model ( 1 )",
    ". the exact turning point might also be somewhat truncation dependent .    in summary ,",
    "we have seen in the previous two sections that the qualitative infrared behaviour of the gluon and ghost propagators of landau gauge qcd starts to emerge in volumes of estimate sizes between @xmath312 fm and 15 fm . to reliably extract infrared exponents and other quantitative results about their infrared behaviour ,",
    "one furthermore needs a certain range of momenta with a clear separation of scales ( [ eq : valrange ] ) which requires much larger volumes .",
    "the leading finite - size effects are under good control , and can be described by the simple screening masses @xmath313 via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : irfit ] ) , when the effective exponents approach their infinite volume scaling behaviour and are sufficiently close to @xmath33 .",
    "our extrapolation method predicts that this might require volumes of about 40 fm in size .",
    "we now compare our results from dses on a torus to the ones from lattice calculations .",
    "lattice studies of the landau gauge gluon propagator have quite a long history already @xcite . nowadays , lattice data for the gluon propagator is available on impressively large lattices .",
    "the authors of @xcite report on an @xmath7-study on a @xmath314-lattice , whereas in @xcite results from an @xmath8 calculation on a @xmath315-lattice are discussed with larger lattices on their way .",
    "the physical volumes of both these studies are comparable .",
    "the resulting propagators are very similar with small deviations for the first few points in the infrared . in the upper graph of figure  [ fig : latt ]",
    "we display the @xmath8-results together with data on a smaller volume @xcite and compare with dse - results on tori with similar volumes .",
    "the qualitative agreement of the solutions at similar volumes in the infrared is striking . whereas both",
    ", the lattice and the dse result at the smaller volume @xmath316 seem to diverge , one starts to observe an infrared finite one , or perhaps even a slight infrared suppression , at the larger volumes @xmath317 .",
    "this indicates that the scaling behaviour of the lattice results with volume may be very similar to the ones of the dse solution .",
    "if so , then our results from the last section predict also a turnover of the lattice data when even larger volumes are considered .",
    "the situation is less clear for the ghost dressing function , which was first studied on the lattice in @xcite .",
    "our results for three different volumes , @xmath318 , are compared to the su(3 ) lattice results of @xcite .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "to date no systematic lattice study on the effects of the gauge group on the ghost propagator exists . ] for the dse solutions we observe a characteristic deviation of the two lowest momentum points at each volume from the infinite volume solution .",
    "as shown in the previous section these deviations correspond to a ghost mass which goes to zero in the infinite volume limit .",
    "the lattice results do not seem to show such behaviour as yet . even though the lattice volumes herein are roughly between 3 fm and 4.5 fm , and thus still rather small compared to our analysis in the previous section , there appears to be not much sign of a volume dependence at all at this point .",
    "the situation is indeed reminiscent of the corresponding torus solution from the previous dse studies . perhaps revisiting the renormalisation procedure as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : renorm ] might have a similar influence in the analysis of the lattice data .    in these relatively small volumes , however , some finite - volume effects in our dse solutions might also still be somewhat truncation dependent and could therefore contribute to the differences between the dse solutions and on the lattice simulations .",
    "furthermore , effects from gribov copies are known to influence the lattice results for the ghost propagator much stronger than for the glue .",
    "this has been investigated by comparing results from gauge fixing to the first gribov copy ( _ fc _ ) to the results of a more involved procedure of repeated gauge fixing and selecting then the best copy ( _ bc _ ) . on rather small volumes these two procedures",
    "have been compared in @xcite and noticeable effects observed .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn in @xcite .",
    "therefore , a meaningful comparison between the dse and lattice ghost propagator not only awaits an improved truncation scheme in the dses and results on larger volumes on the lattice , but also a further clarification of gauge fixing effects in both , the continuum and lattice studies .",
    "the results presented here explicitly demonstrate that landau gauge propagators from lattice and continuum calculations are compatible , provided finite volume effects are properly taken into account .",
    "the approach of the torus solutions towards the infinite volume limit is slow , but steady and quantifiable .",
    "our results show that the characteristic maximum in the gluon propagator should be measurable in volumes of the order @xmath319 which come into grasp for lattice calculations .",
    "this important qualitative effect will be the hallmark of the onset of the asymptotic infrared region .",
    "the results also demonstrate , however , that extremely large volumes will be necessary for a more quantitative comparison between results in the continuum and on the lattice .",
    "the reason is , of course , the requirement ( [ eq : valrange ] ) to observe the asymptotic infrared behaviour .",
    "hence , even verifying the scaling of the infrared exponent according to figure [ fig : fit ] requires spanning an enormous range of volumes .",
    "thus the agreement between both methods can be at best qualitative for quite some time to come .",
    "that so far not even a very good qualitative agreement could be observed can also be understood with the results presented here .",
    "the most characteristic qualitative feature of the gluon propagator is its maximum . to observe it",
    ", it is trivially necessary to also observe its infrared suppression .",
    "this suppression depends on the quantitative value of the infrared exponent @xmath320 .",
    "in particular , its value in landau gauge , compared , _ e.  g. _ , to coulomb gauge , leads to a very weak infrared suppression .",
    "hence very large volumes are necessary to observe this suppression , and hence the maximum .",
    "nonetheless , if a clear maximum emerges in the gluon propagator on larger lattices , confirming the predictions made here , it will definitely be an important piece in our understanding of the confinement mechanism in landau gauge .",
    "finally we would like to remark that all volume effects discussed here are only typical for correlation functions involving intrinsically massless fields .",
    "objects , which have an intrinsic mass - scale , like quarks or hadrons , will only indirectly be affected by such finite volume effects . for quarks",
    "these effects may be still significant , as can be seen from the results of @xcite .",
    "the situation is different , however , for hadrons : the specific far infrared behaviour of the gluon correlation functions are expected to be nearly irrelevant to hadronic observables @xcite .",
