    "the problem of comparing two large population covariance matrices has important applications in modern genomics , where growing attentions have been devoted to understanding how the relationship ( e.g. dependencies or co - regulations ) among genes vary between different biological states .",
    "our interest in this problem is motivated by a microarray study on human asthma @xcite .",
    "this study consists of 88 asthma patients and 20 controls .",
    "it is known that genes tend to work collectively in groups to achieve certain biological tasks .",
    "our analysis focuses on such groups of genes ( gene sets ) defined with the gene ontology ( go ) framework , which are referred to as go terms .",
    "identifying go terms with altered dependence structures between disease and control groups provides critical information on differential gene pathways associated with asthma .",
    "many of the go terms contain a large number of ( in the asthma data , as many as 8,070 ) genes .",
    "the large dimension of microarray data and the complex dependence structure among genes make the problem of comparing two population matrices extremely challenging .    in conventional multivariate analysis where the dimension @xmath0 is fixed , testing the equality of two unknown covariance matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 based on the samples with sample sizes @xmath3 and @xmath4 has been extensively studied ,",
    "see for example @xcite and the references therein . in the high - dimensional setting where @xmath5 , recently several authors have developed new tests other than the traditional likelihood ratio test .",
    "considering multivariate normal data , @xcite and @xcite constructed tests using different distances based on traces of the covariance matrices ; @xcite proposed a @xmath6-statistic based test for a more general multivariate model .",
    "these tests are effective for dense alternatives , but often suffer from low power when @xmath7 is sparse .",
    "we are more interested in this latter situation , as in genomics the difference in the dependence structures between populations typically involves only a small number of genes . for sparse alternatives , @xcite investigated an @xmath8-type test .",
    "they proved that the distribution of the test statistic converges to a type i extreme value distribution under the null hypothesis and the test enjoys certain optimality property .",
    "motivated by this work , we propose in this paper a perturbed variation of the @xmath8-type test statistic .",
    "we verify that the conditional distribution of the perturbed @xmath8-statistic provides a high - quality approximation to the distribution of the original @xmath8-type test , which has important implications in achieving accurate performance in finite sample size .",
    "in contrast , the convergence rate to the extreme - value distribution of type i is of order @xmath9 @xcite .    the asymptotic validity of our proposed new procedure does not require any structural assumptions on the unknown covariances .",
    "it is valid under weak moment conditions . on the other hand ,",
    "the aforementioned work all require certain parametric distributional assumptions or structural assumptions on the population covariances in order to derive an asymptotically pivotal distribution .",
    "assumptions of this kind are not only difficult to be verified but also often violated in real data .",
    "it is known that expression levels of the genes regulated by the same pathway @xcite or associated with the same functionality @xcite are often highly correlated .",
    "also , in the microarray and sequencing experiments , most genes are expressed at very low levels while few are expressed at high levels .",
    "this implies that the distribution of gene expressions is most likely heavy - tailed regardless of the normalization and transformations @xcite .    for testing @xmath10 in high dimensions ,",
    "the new procedure is computationally fast and adaptive to the unknown dependence structures .",
    "section [ method.sec ] introduces the new testing procedure and investigates its theoretical properties . in section [ simulation.sec ]",
    ", we compare its finite sample performance with several competitive procedures .",
    "a gene clustering algorithm is derived in section [ sec51 ] , which aims to group hundreds or thousands of genes based on the expression patterns @xcite without imposing restrictive structural assumptions .",
    "we apply the proposed procedures to the human asthma dataset in section [ real ] .",
    "section [ discuss ] discusses our results and other related work .",
    "proofs of the theoretical results and additional numerical results are provided in the supplementary material .",
    "the proposed methods have been implemented in the ` r ` package ` hdtest ` and is currently available on cran ( http://cran.r-project.org ) .",
    "let @xmath11 and @xmath12 be two @xmath0-dimensional random vectors with means @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and covariance matrices @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "we are interested in testing h_0 : _ 1 = _ 2   h_1 : _ 1 _ 2 [ covariance.test ] based on independent random samples @xmath17 and @xmath18 drawn from the distributions of @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively . for each @xmath21 and @xmath22 , we write @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be the sample analogues of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath27 and @xmath28 .    for each @xmath29 , a straightforward extension of the two - sample @xmath30-statistic for the marginal hypothesis @xmath31 versus @xmath32",
    "is given by _",
    "k= , [ eq2.3 ] where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are estimators of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively .",
    "since the null hypothesis in ( [ covariance.test ] ) is equivalent to @xmath37 , a natural test statistic that is powerful against sparse alternatives in ( [ covariance.test ] ) is the @xmath8-statistic @xmath38      one way to base a testing procedure on the @xmath8-statistic is to reject the null hypothesis ( [ covariance.test ] ) when @xmath39 , where @xmath40 corresponds to the @xmath41-quantile of the type i extreme value distribution .",
    "@xcite proved that this leads to a test that maintains level @xmath42 asymptotically and enjoys certain optimality .    in this section",
    ", we propose a new test that rejects ( [ covariance.test ] ) when @xmath43 , where @xmath44 is obtained using a fast - computing data perturbation procedure .",
    "the new procedure resolves two issues at once .",
    "first , it achieves better finite sample performance by avoiding the slow convergence of @xmath45 to the type i extreme value distribution .",
    "second and more importantly , our procedure relaxes the conditions on the covariance matrices required in @xcite ( particularly , their conditions ( c1 ) and ( c3 ) ) .",
    "note that their condition ( c1 ) essentially requires that the number of variables that have non - degenerate correlations with others should grow no faster than the rate of @xmath0 .",
    "although this condition is reasonable in some applications , it is hard to be justified for data from the microarray or transcriptome experiments , where the genes can be divided into gene sets with varying sizes according to functionalities , and usually genes from the same set have relatively high ( sometimes very high ) intergene correlations compared to those from different sets .",
    "this corresponds to an approximate block structure .",
    "many sets can contain several thousand genes , a polynomial order of @xmath0 .",
    "this kind of block structure with growing block size may violate condition ( c1 ) in @xcite .",
    "the crux of the derivation of the asymptotic type i extreme value distribution in @xcite is that the @xmath46 s are weakly dependent under @xmath47 under certain regularity conditions .",
    "in contrast , the new procedure we present below automatically takes into account correlations among the @xmath48 s .    specifically , we propose the following procedure to compute @xmath49 with the dependence among @xmath48 s incorporated .",
    "independent of @xmath50 and @xmath51 , we generate a sequence of independent @xmath52 random variables @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the total sample size .",

    "this algorithm combines the ideas of multiplier bootstrap and parametric bootstrap .",
    "the principle of parametric bootstrap allows @xmath64 s constructed in step ( ii ) to retain the covariance structure of @xmath48 s .",
    "the validity of multiplier bootstrap is guaranteed by the multiplier central limit theorem , see @xcite for traditional fixed- and low - dimensional settings and @xcite for more recent development in high dimensions .    for implementation",
    ", it is natural to compute the critical value @xmath44 via monte carlo simulation by @xmath65 , where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are @xmath68 independent realizations of @xmath69 in ( [ eq2.5 ] ) by repeating steps ( i ) and ( ii ) . for any prespecified @xmath70 , the null hypothesis ( [ covariance.test ] )",
    "is rejected whenever @xmath71 .",
    "the main computational cost of our procedure for computing the critical value @xmath72 only involves generating @xmath73 independent and identically distributed @xmath52 variables .",
    "it took only 0.0115 seconds to generate one million such realizations based on a computer equipped with intel(r ) core(mt ) i7 - 4770 cpu @xmath74 3.40ghz .",
    "hence even taking @xmath68 to be in the order of thousands , our procedure can be easily accomplished efficiently when @xmath0 is large .",
    "the difference between @xmath44 and its monte carlo counterpart @xmath75 is usually negligible for a large value of @xmath68 . in this section ,",
    "we study the asymptotic properties of the proposed test @xmath76 under both the null hypothesis and a sequence of local alternatives .    for the asymptotic properties",
    ", we only require the following relaxed regularity conditions .",

    "assumption ( c3 ) ensures that the random variables @xmath90 and @xmath91 are non - degenerate .",
    "the moment assumptions , ( c1)(c3 ) , for the proposed procedure are similar to conditions ( c2 ) and ( c2@xmath92 ) in @xcite .",
    "assumption ( c4 ) is a standard condition in two - sample hypothesis testing problems .",
    "as discussed before , no structural assumptions on the unknown covariances are imposed for the proposed procedure .",
    "theorem [ asymptotic.size ] below shows that , under these mild moment and regularity conditions , the proposed test @xmath93 with @xmath49 defined in section [ sec22a ] has an asymptotically @xmath42 .",

    "the asymptotic validity of the proposed test is obtained without imposing structural assumptions on @xmath1 and @xmath2 , nor do we specify any a priori parametric shape constraints of the data distributions , such as condition  a3 in @xcite or conditions  ( c1 ) and ( c3 ) in @xcite .",
    "next , we investigate the asymptotic power of @xmath93 .",
    "it is known that the @xmath8-type test statistics are preferred to the @xmath99-type statistics , including those proposed by @xcite and @xcite , when sparse alternatives are under consideration . as discussed in section [ intro ] , the scenario in which the difference between @xmath1 and @xmath2 occurs only at a small number of locations is of great interest in a variety of scientific studies .",
    "therefore , we focus on the local sparse alternatives characterized by the following class of matrices @xmath100 theorem [ power.consistency ] below shows that , with probability tending to 1 , the proposed test @xmath93 is able to distinguish @xmath47 from the alternative @xmath101 whenever @xmath102 for some @xmath103 .",

    "the original dominating gene clusters are broken into small groups in the presence of the disease . the different configurations in primary gene clusters between the health and asthma groups for go:0060333 provide further information on how inf-@xmath170 influences the inos pathway .",
    "for the critical enzyme tpo , figure [ go5 ] shows that genes also tend to function in clusters in the disease group . in the presence of asthma , the gene cluster hbb - hba2.1-hba2",
    "is preserved and the gene ipcef1 is isolated from the original largest gene cluster for go:0004601 .",

    "the identified duox2 gene cluster provides a candidate pathway to understand how tpo catalyzes the inos - duox2-thyroid peroxidase pathway discovered by @xcite .",
    "last but not least , it can be seen from figure [ go5 ] that the overall co - regulation patterns remain similar across populations , while those of tpo alters in the presence of asthma .    in summary , based on the proposed procedure , not only",
    "can we test the difference in gene dependence , we can also discover the disparity in gene clustering , which reflects the difference in gene clustering patterns between the health and disease groups .",
    "in this paper , we proposed a computationally fast and effective procedure for testing the equality of two large covariance matrices .",
    "the proposed procedure is powerful against sparse alternatives corresponding to the situation where the two covariance matrices differ only in a small fraction of entries .",
    "compared to existing tests , the proposed procedure requires no structural assumptions on the unknown covariance matrices and remains valid under mild conditions .",
    "these appealing features grant the proposed test a vast applicability , particularly for real problems arising in genomics . as an important application",
    ", we introduced a gene clustering algorithm that enjoys the same nice feature of avoiding imposing structural assumptions on the unknown covariance matrices .",
    "another interesting and related problem is testing the equality of two precision matrices , which was recently studied by @xcite . in the literature of graphical models , it is common to impose the gaussian assumption on data so that the conditional dependency can be inferred based on the precision matrix . when the discrepancy between two precision matrices is believed to be sparse , the data - dependent procedure considered in this paper can be extended to comparing them by utilizing the similar @xmath8-type statistic discussed in @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to investigate whether our method can be applied to testing precision matrices in the presence of heavy - tailed data , which is often modeled by the elliptical distribution family .",
    "we leave this to future work .",
