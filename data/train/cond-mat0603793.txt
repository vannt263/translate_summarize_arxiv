    "a review of basic results for the bec vortices can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . in most works",
    ", vortices were studied in self - repulsive becs , with a positive scattering length characterizing collisions between atoms . in the experiment ,",
    "vortices are created stirring the condensate by a properly designed laser beam @xcite , or by imprinting an appropriate phase pattern onto a condensate trapped in a joffe - pritchard magnetic trap @xcite .",
    "recently , more complex vortical structures were predicted in repulsive condensates , such as vortex dipoles @xcite and quadrupoles @xcite , and patterns in the form of globally linked topological defects @xcite .",
    "vortices in repulsive becs may be regarded as dark solitons on a finite background , similar to optical vortices in a self - defocusing dielectric medium @xcite .",
    "a challenging issue is the study of _ vortex solitons _ ( completely localized objects with embedded vorticity ) in attractive becs , with a negative scattering length @xcite .",
    "in particular , attractive interaction occurs in the @xmath12li condensate @xcite , where quasi - one - dimensional solitons were created @xcite .",
    "the most natural setting for vortex solitons is a  pancake \" condensate , strongly confined in one direction ( @xmath13 ) and weakly trapped in the radial direction ( @xmath14 ) in the transverse plane . in the experiment ,",
    "the  pancake \" is created by a superposition of a tight optical trap , with a confinement thickness @xmath15 , and a loose radial magnetic trap with a trapping frequency @xmath16 in the transverse plane @xcite . the theoretical description of the  pancake \" configuration assumes that the underlying three - dimensional ( 3d ) gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) may be reduced to its 2d counterpart .",
    "the condition necessary for the reduction is that the squared harmonic - oscillator length determined by the radial trapping frequency @xmath16 , @xmath17 ( @xmath18 is the atomic mass ) , must be much larger than @xmath19 , i.e. , @xmath20 for li atoms trapped in the diffraction - limited gap between two parallel strongly repulsive ( blue - detuned ) light sheets , with @xmath21 @xmath22 m , this means @xmath23 khz , which is readily met in the experiment , where confining frequencies are measured in tens of hz .",
    "condition ( [ pancake ] ) also rule out bending instability of vortex cores in the pancake geometry ( in the full 3d case , the instability results in decay of straight vortices into vortex rings , in repulsive condensates @xcite ) , as @xmath15 is much smaller than the vertical length necessary for the bending .",
    "the condition ( [ pancake ] ) for the applicability of the 2d approximation can be cast in another form , which sets a limit on the number of atoms @xmath24 in the pancake - shaped condensate . as shown below",
    ", this form is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the ( negative ) scattering length .",
    "taking the same value @xmath27 @xmath22 m as above , together with experimentally relevant @xmath28 hz [ in this case , eq .",

    "( [ n ] ) yields @xmath31 .    generally , vortex solitons are unstable against collapse ( catastrophic self - compression of the wave function ) , and also against azimuthal perturbations which break the axial symmetry of the solitons .",
    "in fact , condition ( [ n ] ) provides for the stability of the quasi-2d solitons against the 3d collapse . within the framework of the 2d description , both the ordinary ( zero - vorticity ) solitons and their vortical counterparts",
    "can be stabilized by a square - shaped optical lattice ( ol ) @xcite . the same ol can also support weakly localized vortex solitons of the _ gap type _ in a repulsive bec @xcite ; a quasi-1d lattice stabilizes ordinary solitons , but not vortices , in the 2d model with self - attraction @xcite . in attractive condensates , ordinary 3d solitons can be stabilized by low - dimensional ols [ viz . , a quasi-2d lattice @xcite , or an axially symmetric one @xcite ] , as well as by the full 3d lattice @xcite ( for a recent review of multidimensional solitons in optics and bec , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in addition",
    ", 2d zero - vorticity solitons can be stabilized by means of the _  feshbach - resonance management _",
    "@xcite , which amounts to time - periodic modulation of the scattering length between positive and negative values @xcite .",
    "however , the latter mechanism can not stabilize vortex solitons @xcite , although it may inhibit the development of their instability @xcite .    while vortex solitons of the 2d gpe with a negative scattering length are strongly unstable in free space , they can be stabilized by the radial trapping potential , @xmath32 .",
    "this issue was considered in an early work @xcite and more recently @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the radial trap stabilizes zero - vorticity ( @xmath33 ) states against collapse , provided that the norm of the solution ( which is proportional to the number of atoms in the condensate ) is limited from above . in the 3d case with the isotropic radial trap",
    ", the maximum norm depends on the corresponding trapping frequency @xmath16 .",
    "this maximum norm was found by means of the variational approximation and from numerical computations @xcite .",
    "in contrast to that , the maximum 2d norm , @xmath34 , _ does not _ depend on @xmath16 , being exactly equal to the norm of the corresponding _ townes soliton _ in the free 2d space @xcite .",
    "similarly , the maximum value of the norm for the trapped fundamental vortex ( one with @xmath0 ) , which does not lead to collapse , depends on @xmath16 in the 3d case ( the shape of the 3d trap which maximizes the collapse threshold under additional conditions was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but not in the 2d situation , where it coincides with the known collapse threshold , @xmath35 , of the fundamental vortex soliton in free space @xcite .",
    "formally , the vorticity gives rise to a dramatic increase of the 2d collapse threshold : @xmath36 .",
    "however , we will demonstrate that the actual increase of the 2d stability threshold , @xmath37 , in the fundamental vortex is a more modest effect , amounting to @xmath38 ; in the remaining part of the existence interval for the vortex , @xmath39 , the azimuthal instability splits the vortex into a pair of fragments , which then collapse intrinsically .",
    "it is relevant to mention that , in various models of nonlinear optics ( see refs .",
    "@xcite and brief reviews @xcite ) , vortex solitons , while being stable against radial perturbations , are easily split into fragments by an azimuthal instability .",
    "nevertheless , _ azimuthally stable _ vortical solitons have been predicted too , in models with competing @xcite or nonlocal nonlinearities @xcite , and in defocusing media with an imprinted cylindrical lattice @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we aim to investigate the stability of vortices in the 2d gpe equation with self - attraction and weak radial trapping potential , through computation of a full set of the corresponding stability eigenvalues .",
    "the results will be verified by direct simulations .",
    "we conclude that all vortices with @xmath11 are unstable ( as conjectured in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , while the fundamental ones ( @xmath0 ) are completely stable for @xmath40 [ in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was conjectured that @xmath41 . at @xmath42 ,",
    "the @xmath0 vortex is destabilized by symmetry - breaking oscillatory perturbations .",
    "further , in an adjacent interval , @xmath43 , the evolution of the unstable vortex _ does not _ lead to collapse ; instead , it features nearly periodic splittings in two fragments followed by their recombinations back into the vortex .",
    "this regular dynamical regime was not known before . in the remaining part of the existence interval , @xmath44 ,",
    "fragments produced by the splitting of the vortex do not recombine , but rather blow up intrinsically , as their individual norm exceeds the collapse threshold for the townes soliton .",
    "we will also verify that the results obtained within the framework of the 2d model are valid indeed in the full 3d gpe with the corresponding anisotropic trap .",
    "in particular , in a moderately anisotropic 3d model , with the radial - confinement length @xmath45 [ see eq .",
    "( [ ho ] ) ] larger by a factor of @xmath7 than its counterpart , @xmath46 , in the orthogonal ( tightly confined ) direction , the relative size of the stability area inside the existence region for 3d solitons with the embedded vorticity @xmath0 is @xmath47 , which is to be compared to the above - mentioned relative size of the stability region , @xmath48 , in the 2d limit .",
    "approaching the isotropic limit , @xmath49 , the stability area expands , attaining the relative size @xmath50 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we formulate the 2d model , briefly recapitulating its derivation from the 3d gpe . in section 3 ,",
    "we present basic results for the 2d model : shapes of the vortex states ( actually , we find them by continuation of exact states with a definite value of the angular momentum in the linear 2d schrdinger equation ) , and eigenvalues that determine their stability . in section 4 ,",
    "we verify the predicted stability conditions by direct simulations . in section 5 , we consider the full 3d model with the anisotropic trap , and section 5 concludes the paper .",

    "the density is determined , together with a characteristic radial size @xmath64 of the pancake itself , by the condition of the balance between the radial quantum pressure , radial trapping force , and nonlinear self - attraction , which yields @xmath65 the substitution of expressions ( [ groundstate ] ) and ( [ 2d ] ) in the above condition @xmath66 , which implies the tight transverse confinement , leads to eq . ( [ pancake ] ) that determines the range of the radial trapping frequencies where the 2d description is applicable . as a consequence of this condition ,",
    "the aspect ratio of the pancake configuration is always large , @xmath67 .",

    "then , wave functions with given vorticity @xmath105 in the @xmath51 plane are constructed as combinations of factorized wave functions ( [ xyz ] ) , subject to the same constraint as in the 2d case , i.e. , @xmath202 . from this restriction and from the form of the chemical potential in the linear - limit solution ( [ xyz ] ) with @xmath201 , @xmath203 , it follows that the chemical potential of solutions to the full nonlinear equation ( [ 3dr ] ) , obtained as a continuation starting from the linear limit , obeys a limitation @xmath204 cf .",
    "( [ cutoff ] ) .    numerically found families of the 3d soliton solutions with @xmath0 are characterized by @xmath128 and @xmath154 curves displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , one for the anisotropic model , with @xmath205 , and one for its isotropic counterpart , with @xmath206 . in the former case [ which , as a matter of fact , is not a strongly anisotropic one , as the corresponding aspect ratio of the confinement lengths in the @xmath51 and @xmath13 directions is @xmath7 , pursuant to eq .",
    "( [ ho ] ) ] , the existence and stability intervals of the fundamental vortices have been found to be , respectively , @xmath207 , and @xmath208 [ cf .",
    "( [ main ] ) and ( [ unstable ] ) in the 2d model ] , hence the relative size of the stability area is @xmath209 .",
    "this should be compared to the relative size of the stability area in the 2d limit reported above , which is @xmath210 . for the isotropic model ( @xmath206 ) ,",
    "the existence and stability intervals are , respectively , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 their ratio being @xmath213 .",
    "thus , we conclude that the 2d limit yields a reasonable approximation for the pancake - shaped configurations ( the relative difference between its prediction and the direct numerical result for the moderately anisotropic model with the aspect ratio @xmath7 is @xmath214 ) .",
    "another noteworthy conclusion is that the relative size of the stability area essentially increases as the 3d model approaches the isotropic configuration ; in the isotropic limit , the relative size of the stability region is almost twice as large as in the 2d limit . in terms of the maximum value of the norm , @xmath215 , up to which the vortex soliton remains stable ,",
    "the difference is still bigger : @xmath215 for @xmath206 exceeds its counterpart for @xmath205 by a factor of @xmath216 .    to further illustrate the effect of the degree of asymmetry on the stability of vortex solitons , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we display the spectrum of unstable eigenvalues for the 3d solitons with @xmath0 , in the same two cases as considered above , i.e. , the moderately anisotropic one with @xmath205 , and isotropic with @xmath206 .",
    "comparison of this figure with the respective picture from fig .",
    "[ fig2](a ) for the 2d model shows a gradual deformation of the spectrum with the transition from the 2d limit to the isotropic 3d configuration .",
    "an important observation is that the transition from the 2d approximation to the full 3d model does not lead to any new instability eigenmode ( at least , up to the isotropic limit , @xmath206 ) ; incidentally , the bending instability of the vortex core does not occur either .    as well as in the 2d case , vortex solitons with @xmath11 [ at least , the  flattest \" ones , corresponding to @xmath201 in the linear limit , see eq .",
    "( [ xyz ] ) ] are all unstable . as concerns the fundamental solitons with @xmath33 , we could easily reproduce a known result stating that , as well as in the 2d model , they are stable within their full existence region , which is @xmath217 for @xmath218 , and @xmath219 for @xmath206 . comparing these values with ones in eqs .",
    "( [ omega=10 ] ) and ( [ omega=1 ] ) , we conclude that the introduction of the vorticity enhances the stability limit by a factor of @xmath220 for @xmath205 , and by @xmath10 for @xmath206 .",
    "recall that , in the 2d model , the same enhancement factor was @xmath221 [ if its definition does not include the extra region ( [ intermediate ] ) of the quasi - stable dynamical states ] ; this again demonstrates a general trend to the expansion of stability regions with the transition from the 2d limit to the fully isotropic 3d case .",
    "we have reported results of accurate investigation of the stability of localized vortices in bose - einstein condensates with self - attraction , trapped in the nearly two - dimensional configuration .",
    "we have briefly recapitulated the derivation of the effective 2d gross - pitaevskii equation from its full 3d counterpart , and demonstrated that , in the 2d limit , the vortices with @xmath0 are stable against azimuthal splitting in a _ third _ of their existence region , i.e. , for @xmath1 , in terms of the solution s norm ( which is proportional to the number of atoms trapped in the vortex soliton ) . in the adjacent interval , @xmath222  @xmath5 , the unstable vortex does not collapse , but rather demonstrates stable quasi - periodic dynamics , featuring cycles of splitting into two fragments and recombination , which is a novel dynamical regime .",
    "for @xmath223 , the two segments produced by the splitting fail to recombine , as they collapse intrinsically .",
    "the stable vortex soliton created in the pancake - shaped condensate of @xmath12li may contain up to @xmath224 atoms .",
    "the results were checked against direct simulations of the 2d gross - pitaevskii equation , and , which is crucially important for the verification of their physical relevance , they were compared with the stability analysis of localized vortices in the full 3d equation . it was concluded that , for the moderately anisotropic 3d configuration with the aspect ratio @xmath225 , the stability interval of the @xmath0 vortices occupies @xmath8 of their existence region ( hence , the 2d limit provides for quite a reasonable approximation ) . in the 3d isotropic limit , the stability interval expands to @xmath9 of the existence domain . the enhancement factor for the collapse threshold , caused by the introduction of vorticity @xmath0 ,",
    "was found too ; in the 3d isotropic configuration it attains the value of @xmath10 .",
    "all higher - order localized vortices , with @xmath11 , are completely unstable , in the 2d limit and in the full 3d gross - pitaevskii equation alike .",
