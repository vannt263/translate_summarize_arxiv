    "classical novae outbursts are thermonuclear runaways ( tnr , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) on a mass - accreting white dwarf in cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) [ for a general review of cvs , see @xcite ] .",
    "observational distinction of classical novae is usually done spectroscopically .",
    "classical novae can be easily distinguished from other high - amplitude variable stars by the presence of broad emission lines often accompanied by a p cyg - type profile .",
    "such a distinction , however , is sometimes difficult especially when the detection of a new object on a photograph or a ccd image was done at later times .",
    "difficult conditions are also easily met when discovery alert is not timely distributed . in some cases ,",
    "researchers are obliged to distinguish novae from other objects only with limited information .",
    "for example , only 50% of the reported novae in @xcite ( up to 1986 ) were spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "some objects later turned out to be mira - type stars ( e.g. @xcite ) or large - amplitude dwarf novae [ see @xcite for a review of such objects ] .",
    "early spectroscopic confirmation based on a secure perspective of a newly discovered object is therefore a necessary condition for modern nova studies .",
    "the condition has been greatly improved by the advent of the global network of observers , vsnet , http://www.kusastro.kyoto - u.ac.jp / vsnet/. @xmath4 , which enabled quick dissemination of discovery alerts .",
    "the best examples include v1548 aql = nova aql 2001 @xcite and v463 sct = nova sct 2000 ( this paper ) , which may have been overlooked with a traditional confirmatory procedure .",
    "in 2000 march , one of the authors ( kh ) discovered a new variable star named had  v46 .",
    "because of the close presence of an iras source ( iras 18311@xmath51447 ) , this variable star was initially regarded as a mira - type long - period variable .",
    "however , we noticed a small offset of the reported position from the iras position .",
    "we thereby took ccd images in order to check the identification with the iras source .",
    "the ccd images taken on 2000 march 14.9 ut showed that the iras source is more likely to be identified with a red usno star at , ( j2000.0 ) ( star a in figure [ fig : id ] ) and an unexpected fading of had  v46 .",
    "since had  v46 looked like to be a large - amplitude ( probably eruptive ) non - red variable star , the object was reported as a possible nova @xcite .",
    "we examined past photographic survey images taken by kt and kh .",
    "the object was not recorded down to 14.0 mag on 21 photographs between 1996 may 25 and 1999 november 10 .",
    "furthermore , spectroscopic observation by mf revealed the presence of strong broad emission lines , which indicates that had  v46 is indeed a nova @xcite .",
    "the object was given the permanent variable star designation of v463 sct .",
    "astrometry of had  v46 was done with kyoto images taken on 2000 march 14.9 ut and sk s image taken on march 16.8 ut , with gsc - act reference stars .",
    "the accurate position of had  v46 was found to be , ( j2000.0 , internal error ) .",
    "figure [ fig : id ] shows a comparison of the outburst image and quiescent identification on dss .",
    "the object was not detected on all available dss images between 1984 august and 1996 september ( 6 images ) .",
    "the lack of detection of the prenova on these dss images leads to an upper limit @xmath6 20 for the quiescent magnitude of v463 sct @xcite .",

    "at a first look , the rapid evolution of the light curve around in early march seems to suggest that the brightest observation by kt on march 2 was obtained close to the epoch of the maximum . following this interpretation ,",
    "we obtain @xmath2 = 6 d based on kt s subsequent observations using the same system .",
    "this value would indicate that v463 sct belongs to very fast novae @xcite . by applying a recent calibration between the rate of decline and absolute magnitude at maximum @xcite",
    ", we obtain the maximum @xmath20 = @xmath58.9 @xmath3 0.5 .",
    "since photographic observations and visual observations have been confirmed to agree within @xmath210.3 mag , we can then safely adopt apparent maximum magnitude of @xmath10 = 9.9 . by adopting a mean @xmath7 of + 0.75 during the early decline phase and the intrinsic color @xmath7 = @xmath22 for novae 2 mag below the maximum @xcite",
    ", we obtained @xmath23 = + 0.8 @xmath3 0.1 .",
    "the observed constancy of the @xmath7 s during the observation precludes a possible effect of a reddening pulse which occurs in some novae around their optical maxima @xcite . using the generally adopted relation @xmath24 and @xmath23",
    ", we can derive a distance modulus of 16.3 @xmath3 0.6 .",
    "this value is , however , too large to accept .",
    "the other interpretation is that the  maximum \" caught on march 2 is better understood as a delayed flare - like maximum sometimes seen in very slow novae [ e.g. hr del ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , v723 cas ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , v1548 aql ( @xcite ) , and do aql ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] .",
    "the measured line width ( fwhm = 990 km s@xmath0 ) seems to support this analogy [ the fwhms of v1548 aql and v723 cas were reported to be 1100 and 600 km s@xmath0 , respectively ( @xcite , @xcite ) ] the flat portion of the light curve around @xmath10 = 12.0 , following the first positive detection @xmath21 24 d before march 2 , is reasonably interpreted as a premaximum halt . the exact duration of the premaximum halt was not determined because of the lack of observations ( around the solar conjunction ) between 1999 november 10 and 2000 february 6 . on 1999",
    "november 10 , the object was fainter than @xmath10 = 14.0 . following this interpretation , the linear portion of the later evolution of the light curve would better represent the characteristic decline rate .",
    "the linear decline rate since march 2 has been estimated to correspond to @xmath2 = 15 @xmath3 3 d. if we adopt @xmath2 = 15 and the relation in @xcite , @xmath20 becomes only 0.5 mag fainter than the case of @xmath2 = 6 d , which yields a still unacceptably large distance modulus of 15.8 @xmath3 0.6 .",
    "these estimates suggest that the speed of the linear decline part is not a useful indicator of the absolute magnitude of this nova .          since there is a considerable uncertainty in estimating the decline rate , we have adopted @xmath20 = @xmath57.7 ( typical maximum absolute magnitude for classical novae ) as in @xcite . even if we adopt an extreme value of @xmath20 = @xmath58.9 , the following discussion will not be considerably affected .",
    "the absence of a quiescent optical counterpart down to @xmath6 20 corresponds to an upper limit of @xmath20 = 2 ( @xmath20 = 1 for the @xmath20(max ) = @xmath58.9 case ) .",
    "this upper limit is reasonable for a cv - type quiescent counterpart of a classical nova ( e.g. @xcite showed that most of post - outburst classical novae show @xmath20 fainter than + 2 ) .",
    "this limit and the non - detection on 2mass images , however , precludes the possibility of a red giant secondary , as in symbiotic ( recurrent ) novae @xcite .",
    "the present upper limit is insufficient to exclude the possibility of a cv - type recurrent nova @xcite .",
    "as shown in subsection [ sec : absmag ] , v463 sct is clearly exhibited the fastest evolution among the recorded novae with a late - time flare - like maximum and a flat premaximum ( premaximum halt ) , even considering the unavoidable uncertainty in determining @xmath2 .",
    "an literature search in @xcite and @xcite , well - observed fast to moderately fast novae from @xcite , and observations of recent novae in vsnet , vsolj and afoev observations has not revealed a similar example .",
    "this lack of a similar example may have been a result of a selection effect that novae are usually discovered near their optical maxima and very few objects were recorded in their premaximum stage .",
    "although the origin of the phenomenon is not yet well understood , it is well known that the duration of a premaximum halt depends on the nova speed class : in slow novae , the typical duration is a few to several days ; in fast novae , the typical duration is a few hours ( @xcite , p.4 ) . in some slow novae ( hr del",
    ", v1548 aql , v723 cas , do aql , see subsection [ sec : absmag ] for the references ) , the durations can be up to several months .",
    "all these exceptional slow novae are known to belong to the  slowest \" novae ( there is even an argument that v723 cas may be a symbiotic nova , cf .",
    "the occurrence of at least 24 d - long premaximum halt in a rapidly evolving nova ( v463 sct ) is quite exceptional .",
    "this observation suggests that the occurrence of a long premaximum halt and a late - time flare - like maximum is not a unique character of the ",
    "slowest \" novae , but a more general phenomenon spreading over a wider range of nova speed classes than has been previously believed .",
    "figure [ fig : comp ] shows a comparison of three recent novae with a prominent premaximum halt .",
    "the data for v463 sct are the same as in figure [ fig : lc ] .",
    "the data for v1548 aql and v723 cas are from reports to vsnet .",
    "the scales of the axes are different between the objects .",
    "the quick evolution of v463 sct is evident .",
    "@xcite studied the past spectroscopic observations of hr del during its long premaximum stage .",
    "@xcite showed the presence of an almost stationary photosphere with very low velocities , unlike for the majority of classical novae .",
    "@xcite suggested that the conditions of thermonuclear runaway was only marginally satisfied in hr del .",
    "this interpretation is compatible with the measured white dwarf mass in hr del ( 0.52 @xmath25 : @xcite ; 0.595 @xmath25 : @xcite ) combined with models of thermonuclear runaways @xcite .",
    "this interpretation seems to apply to similar very slow novae with a long premaximum halt and delayed maximum .",
    "@xcite proposed that a premaximum halt may be explained as an effect of local thermonuclear runaways , but this possibility has not been examined in more detail .",
    "if the interpretation of @xcite also applies to v463 sct , the rapid subsequent evolution should meet a difficulty because rapidly evolving novae would require a more massive white dwarf ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "if this marginal condition is met in v463 sct , this object should have a high mass - transfer rate .",
    "the uniqueness of v463 sct in that it showed both a slow - nova type long premaximum halt and rapid photometric evolution is expected to provide a most stringent test for this interpretation .",
    "future quiescent observation of v463 sct to determine the white dwarf mass and an accretion rate would therefore provide an unique opportunity in testing the interpretation that premaximum halts reflect a marginally satisfied tnr condition .",
    "the  textbook \" development of the optical spectra of novae has been described by various authors ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite , chap .",
    "1.4 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the post - maximum evolution of nova spectra is known to be complex ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite described that novae at early post - outburst decline can be divided into two classes : feii novae and he / n novae based on the predominant lines .",
    "@xcite reported that feii novae , to which v463 sct belongs , tend to have narrower lines ( i.e. smaller expansion velocity ) and relatively early appearance of [ oi ] lines .",
    "the [ oi ] ( @xmath26 6300 , 6364  ) lines , however , usually appear later than the evolution of feii lines .",
    "for example , @xcite showed that the [ oi ] ( @xmath26 6300 , 6364  ) lines were not strong 14 d after maximum in nova lmc 1991 , 11 d after maximum of v351 pup = nova pup 1991 , 11 d after maximum of v2264 oph = nova oph 1992 no .",
    "1 . all of these novae are fast novae with @xmath27 between 8 and 26 d.    a spectrum of v463 sct is shown in figure [ fig : spec ] . according to @xcite , it usually takes 2030 d in fast novae before the [ oi ] lines become comparable in strength to v463 sct at this epoch .",
    "the early ( only 14 d after the march 2 maximum ) appearance of these lines in v463 sct is thus rather exceptional among feii class novae .",
    "the spectrum is also similar to a spectrum of the moderately fast novae v1425 aql ( nova aql 1995 ) taken 50.5 d after the maximum @xcite , v443 sct ( nova sct 1989 ) 72 d after the maximum @xcite and v1819 cyg ( nova cyg 1986 ) 92 d after the maximum @xcite .",
    "these comparisons suggest that v463 sct showed a moderately evolved spectrum only 14 d after the march 2 maximum .    according to @xcite ,",
    "the feii lines are considered to be formed in high - density winds . since",
    "neutral oxygen is not expected in a homogeneous , high - temperature nebula in a nova , the presence of the [ oi ] lines is usually considered to be a signature of density inhomogeneities which are sufficiently large to prevent complete ionization @xcite .",
    "the presence of the feii and [ oi ] lines suggests that substantial amount of material had been ejected .",
    "since the appearance of the [ oi ] lines in v463 sct seems to be earlier than in other feii class novae , the mass ejection responsible for the [ oi ] lines may have taken place earlier than the march 2 maximum . since the elapsed time ( 38 d )",
    "since the earliest positive detection ( february 6 ) is comparable to the epochs of appearance of the [ oi ] lines in fast to moderately fast feii class novae , the presence of a long premaximum halt may be responsible for this ejection .",
    "as described in section [ sec : discovery ] , the nova was original considered as a red variable based on a possible identification with an iras source . such a technique using catalog correlations to screen out large - amplitude red variables among nova candidates has been widely used .",
    "the present example clearly demonstrate a caveat of this technique in a very crowded region ( v463 sct indeed lied within an error ellipse of the iras source ) .",
    "it is thus highly advisable to check all materials ( dss , 2mass , past archival photographs ) before completely ruling out the possibility of a nova even if the suspect object is close to an iras source .",
    "rapid accurate astrometry is confirmed to be very helpful in accurately identifying the counterpart on dss images , leading to a correct interpretation of a new object .",
    "finally , a rapid circulation of discovery information through a world - wide network such as vsnet is proven to be very effective even when the nature of the new object is not clarified .",
    "without such a medium , a chance in making early epoch observations could have been easily lost ( for an unfortunate example , see @xcite ) especially in fast novae .",
    "we are grateful to many vsnet , vsolj and afoev observers who have reported vital observations .",
