    "the guiding - center dynamics of charged particles moving in a nonuniform magnetic field plays a crucial role in our understanding of magnetically - confined laboratory and space plasmas @xcite . the standard guiding - center ordering used in deriving these guiding - center equations of motion",
    "is based on the dimensionless small parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the gyromotion length scale and @xmath2 is the magnetic - field gradient length scale @xcite .",
    "because of its important extensions to the gyrokinetic self - consistent treatment of low - frequency fluctuations in magnetized plasmas @xcite , it is necessary to gain a full understanding of the validity of the guiding - center approximation , especially when plasma gradients are strong ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in the pedestal region of advanced tokamak plasmas @xcite , the gradient length scale can be as small as @xmath3 cm , which means that a 10 kev proton confined by a 5 t magnetic field ( with a thermal gyroadius @xmath4 mm ) is represented by @xmath5 , which falls well outside the standard guiding - center limit @xmath6 .    in order to investigate the validity of the guiding - center approximation in the presence of strong gradients",
    ", we consider the simplest non - trivial problem of a charged particle ( with mass @xmath7 and charge @xmath8 ) moving in a straight magnetic field with a uniform magnetic - field gradient : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a constant and @xmath11 is the constant gradient length scale .",
    "the lorentz - force equations for the perpendicular motion in the @xmath12-plane are @xmath13 where we introduced the dimensionless coordinates @xmath14 and a prime denotes a derivative with respect to @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 )",

    "we note that these equations satisfy the energy conservation law @xmath19 , where @xmath20 denotes the lowest - order magnetic moment .",

    "we note that the jacobi elliptic functions have also recently been used in the description of guiding - center and bounce - center dynamics in axisymmetric tokamak geometry @xcite .",
    "they have also been used in obtaining exact analytical solutions for charged - particle motion in nonuniform magnetic fields represented by power laws @xcite , which includes the case of particle orbits crossing a line where @xmath37 ( case 3 in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , and stationary current distributions @xcite .",
    "the case of a discontinuous magnetic field ( with a gradient length scale @xmath38 ) is also solved exactly in ref .",
    "we begin by deriving the lowest - order guiding - center results to be quoted in the remainder of this paper . because magnetic - curvature and parallel - gradient effects vanish for the magnetic field , we ignore the parallel motion along field lines .",
    "two features associated with the averaged properties of the particle motion are seen in fig .",

    "first , for the guiding - center approximation of the averaged transverse displacement @xmath39 , we compute the guiding - center averaged particle position @xmath41 according to high - order guiding - center theory @xcite , where @xmath42 is defined as the guiding - center pull - back of the guiding - center position @xmath43 to particle phase space , where the phase - space vector fields @xmath44 generate the guiding - center transformation @xcite . from this expression , we compute the guiding - center averaged - particle displacement @xmath45 where the gyroradius vector @xmath46 depends on the gyroangle @xmath47 , the guiding - center magnetic moment @xmath20 , and the guiding - center coordinate @xmath48 ( because its magnitude depends on the strength of the magnetic field ) , and we used @xmath49 in eq .  .",
    "from eq .  , we see that the guiding - center - averaged @xmath25-position of the particle @xmath50 is equal to the guiding - center position @xmath51 . on the other hand , because of the magnetic - field gradient ( with @xmath52 ) , the normalized guiding - center - averaged particle displacement along the @xmath26-axis is @xmath53 this guiding - center prediction is , in fact , quite close ( see fig .

    "[ fig : num_sol ] .    next , the dimensionless guiding - center drift velocity @xmath54 in a straight magnetic field with a constant gradient ( normalized to the perpendicular particle velocity scale @xmath55 ) is @xcite @xmath56 this guiding - center result is clearly seen as the orbit - averaged drift motion along the @xmath25-axis in fig .",

    "we note that the case of a discontinuous magnetic field discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite exhibits a drift motion that can be calculated exactly along lines similar to the derivation of eq .  .",
    "while these guiding - center predictions - are derived in the standard guiding - center limit @xmath6 ( i.e. , when the magnetic - gradient length scale @xmath2 is assumed to be much longer than the gyromotion length scale @xmath1 ) , we will show that these guiding - center predictions are , in fact , also valid well outside the limit @xmath6 .",
    "we now derive the exact solution for the transverse motion along the @xmath26-axis , which is expressed in terms of the jacobi elliptic functions @xcite . with this solution",

    "this exact solution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : y_sol ] for @xmath75 ( solid ) and @xmath76 ( dashed ) .",
    "we note that , as @xmath36 increases toward 1 , the solution spends an increasingly larger portion of its orbit in the range @xmath77 , although it must still satisfy @xmath78 .",
    "this feature explains why the orbit average is positive for finite magnetic gradients @xmath79 .",
