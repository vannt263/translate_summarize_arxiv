    "in the most natural alternative theories to general relativity ( gr ) , gravity is mediated not only by a ( spin-2 ) graviton corresponding to a metric @xmath0 , but also by a ( spin-0 ) scalar field @xmath1 .",
    "such scalar partners generically arise in all extra - dimensional theories , and notably in string theory .",
    "a dilaton is indeed already present in the supermultiplet of the 10-dimensional graviton , and several other scalar fields ( called the moduli ) also appear when performing a kaluza - klein dimensional reduction to our usual spacetime .",
    "they correspond to the components of the metric tensor @xmath2 in which @xmath3 and @xmath4 label extra dimensions .",
    "moreover , contrary to other alternative theories of gravity , scalar - tensor theories respect most of gr s symmetries : conservation laws , constancy of non - gravitational constants , and local lorentz invariance even if a subsystem is influenced by external masses .",
    "they can also satisfy exactly the weak equivalence principle ( universality of free fall of laboratory - size objects ) even for a massless scalar field .",
    "scalar fields are also involved in the cosmological models which reproduce most consistently present observational data . in particular ,",
    "inflation theory is based on the presence of a scalar @xmath1 in a potential @xmath5 ( for instance parabolic ) .",
    "it behaves as a fluid with a positive energy density @xmath6 but a negative pressure @xmath7 .",
    "this causes a period of exponential expansion of the universe , which can explain why causally disconnected regions at present may have been connected long ago . the isotropy of the observed cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) can thus be understood .",
    "inflation also predicts that our universe is almost spatially flat , because any initial curvature has been exponentially reduced by the expansion .",
    "this is in remarkable agreement with the location of the first acoustic peak of the cmb spectrum at a multipolar index @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "various observations , notably of type ia supernovae  @xcite , tell us that there is about 70% of negative - pressure dark energy in our present universe ( @xmath9 ) , suggesting that its expansion has been re - accelerating recently , since redshifts @xmath10 .",
    "this can be explained by the presence of a cosmological constant @xmath11 in gr , but the quantity @xmath12 translated in natural units gives an extremely small value @xmath13 , very problematic for particle physics if @xmath11 is to be interpreted as the vacuum energy .",
    "this is the main reason why `` quintessence '' models have been proposed , in which the cosmological constant is replaced again by the potential @xmath5 of a scalar field .",
    "its evolution towards a minimum of @xmath14 during the cosmological expansion then explains more naturally why the present value @xmath15 is so small .    besides these theoretical and experimental reasons for studying scalar - tensor theories of gravity ,",
    "one of their greatest interests is to embed gr within a class of mathematically consistent alternatives , in order to understand better which theoretical features have been experimentally tested , and which can be tested further . to simplify this review",
    ", we will restrict it to models involving a single scalar field , although the study of tensor  multi - scalar theories can also be done in great detail  @xcite .",
    "it suffices to note that their phenomenology is richer but similar to the single scalar case , at least when all scalar degrees of freedom carry positive energy , as required for the vacuum to be stable . in view of the very precise experimental verifications of the weak equivalence principle",
    ", we will also focus this review on theories which satisfy it exactly .",
    "in other words , we will assume that the action of geometry on matter is the same as in gr , but that the dynamics of geometry and the action of matter on it is modified because of the presence of a scalar field ( see j.p .",
    "uzan s contribution to the present proceedings , and in particular the upper - right panel of its fig .  1 ) .",
    "all matter fields , including gauge bosons , will thus be assumed to be universally coupled to one second rank symmetric tensor , say @xmath16 .",
    "the difference with gr lies in the kinetic term of this tensor , which is now a mixing of spin-2 and spin-0 excitations .",
    "one indeed defines @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is a function of the scalar field , while @xmath0 denotes the einstein ( spin-2 ) metric .",
    "we will mainly consider the following action  @xcite , @xmath19 , \\label{action}\\ ] ] which depends on two functions of the scalar field : the coupling function @xmath18 to matter , and a potential @xmath5 .",
    "[ our signature is @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the scalar curvature of @xmath0 , and @xmath22 its determinant . ]    in section  [ localtests ] , we will review the main experimental constraints on this coupling function @xmath18 , coming from two qualitatively different classes of data : solar - system experiments and binary - pulsar observations  @xcite . in section  [ reconstruction ] , we will underline that cosmological observations give again very different types of constraints : although they are more noisy , they _ a priori _ allow the reconstruction of both @xmath18 and @xmath5  @xcite .",

    "a massive scalar field has a negligible effect on the motion of celestial bodies if its mass is large with respect to the inverse of the interbody distances . on the other hand ,",
    "if its mass is small enough , its potential @xmath5 can be locally neglected , but its coupling function to matter , @xmath18 , is strongly constrained by experiment , as we will see below .",
    "the intermediate case , for which the size of the experiment is of the same order as the inverse scalar mass , is the main topic of e.  adelberger s contribution to the present proceedings ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the `` chameleon '' field  @xcite is another case where both the potential and the matter ",

    ", the predictions of metric theories of gravity can be parametrized by a set of 10 real numbers in the so called `` ppn '' formalism ( parametrized post - newtonian )  @xcite .",
    "all of them are presently constrained to be very close to their general relativistic values  @xcite , and in particular the two famous parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 introduced by eddington in the schwarzschild metric : @xmath26 general relativity corresponds to @xmath27 . in scalar - tensor theories  @xcite , these two latter parameters are the only ones which can differ from their gr values .",

    "the horizontal axis ( @xmath33 ) corresponds to theories which are perturbatively equivalent to gr , i.e. , which predict strictly no deviation from it ( at any order @xmath34 ) in the weak - field conditions of the solar system .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    the factor @xmath35 comes from the exchange of a scalar particle between two bodies , whereas @xmath36 comes from a scalar exchange between three bodies .",

    ", the second derivative @xmath42 may take large values ( of either sign ) , i.e. , matter may be strongly coupled to two scalar lines .       and the compactness @xmath43 of a body is large enough , it is energetically favorable to create a local scalar field different from the background value .",
    "the body becomes thus strongly coupled to the scalar field .",

    "since @xmath35 is experimentally known to be small , we thus expect the theory to be close to gr at any order .",
    "however , some nonperturbative effects may occur in strong - field conditions : if the compactness @xmath43 of a body is greater than a critical value , the square brackets of eq .",
    "( [ 8 ] ) can become large enough to compensate even a vanishingly small @xmath35 .",
    "this can happen notably for neutron stars , whose compactnesses are of order @xmath47 , as compared to only @xmath48 for the sun or even @xmath49 for the earth .",
    "to illustrate this , let us consider a model for which @xmath41 vanishes strictly , i.e. , which is perturbatively equivalent to gr : there is strictly no deviation from gr at any order in a perturbative expansion in powers of @xmath50 .",
    "a parabolic coupling function @xmath51 suffices for our purpose ( we set here @xmath52 to simplify ) . at the center of a static body ,",
    "the scalar field takes a particular value @xmath53 , and it decreases as @xmath54 outside .",

    "the value @xmath58 now corresponds to a local _ maximum _ of the energy .",
    "it is therefore energetically favorable for the star to create a nonvanishing scalar field @xmath53 , and thereby a nonvanishing `` scalar charge '' @xmath59 .",

    ", one finds that neutron stars are even less coupled to the scalar field than solar - system bodies .",
    "this decoupling is similar to the behavior of the `` chameleon '' field  @xcite , but it is here caused by the nonlinearity of @xmath70 , whereas the chameleon s decoupling is due to a competition between @xmath18 and the potential @xmath5 .",
    "the scalar charge @xmath71 enters the predictions of the theory in the same way as @xmath41 in weak - field conditions .",
    "for instance , in the orbital motion of two bodies @xmath64 and @xmath72 , the eddington parameter @xmath25 keeps the form of eq .",

    "[ fig3 ] , one thus expects deviations by @xmath76 from some general relativistic predictions .",
    "moreover , the quadratic coupling strength @xmath77 can take very large numerical values near the critical mass , like the magnetic susceptibility of ferromagnets .",

    "a pulsar @xmath64 orbiting a companion @xmath80 is thus a moving clock , the best tool that one could dream of to test a relativistic theory .",
    "indeed , by precisely timing its pulse arrivals , one gets a stroboscopic information on its orbit , and one can measure several relativistic effects .",
    "such effects do depend on the two masses @xmath81 , @xmath82 , which are not directly measurable .",
    "however , two different effects suffice to determine them , and a third relativistic observable then gives a test of the theory . in the case of the famous hulse - taylor binary pulsar psr b1913 + 16 ,",
    "three relativistic parameters have been determined with great accuracy  @xcite : ( i )  the einstein time delay parameter @xmath83 , which combines the second - order doppler effect ( @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the pulsar s velocity ) together with the redshift due to the companion ( @xmath86 , where @xmath87 the pulsar - companion distance ) ; ( ii )  the periastron advance @xmath88 ( relativistic effect of order @xmath89 ) ; and ( iii )  the rate of change of the orbital period , @xmath90 , caused by gravitational radiation damping ( an effect of order @xmath91 in gr , but of order @xmath92 in scalar - tensor theories ; see below ) .",

    "the fact that the three lines meet in one point means that there exists a pair of masses ( @xmath93 ) simultaneously consistent with all three observables .",
    "this is thus a spectacular confirmation of einstein s theory .    obviously , these lines are deformed in scalar - tensor theories , and if they do not have any common intersection , the corresponding model is ruled out",

    "[ fig4 ] illustrates such a case .",
    "the allowed theories lie below and to the right of the line labeled psr b1913 + 16 in fig .",
    "this plot shows vividly the qualitative difference between solar - system and binary - pulsar observations .",
    "indeed , the latter impose @xmath94 even for a vanishingly small @xmath41 .",
    "this constraint is due to the spontaneous scalarization of neutron stars , which occurs when @xmath67 is large enough .",
    "equations  ( [ ppn ] ) allow us to rewrite this inequality in terms of the eddington parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , which are both consistent with 1 in the solar system .",
    "one finds @xmath95 the singular ( @xmath96 ) nature of this ratio underlines why such a conclusion could not be obtained in weak - field experiments .",
    "several other binary pulsars are presently known and accurately timed . to simplify fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , we did not display all the constraints they impose in the theory plane ( see ref .",
    "we just plotted as a dotted line the tight ones imposed by the recently timed neutron star ",
    "white dwarf binary psr j1141@xmath976545  @xcite .",
    "contrary to neutron stars , the white dwarf companion is never spontaneously scalarized , because its compactness @xmath43 is too small .",
    "this binary system is thus very asymmetrical , and the pulsar s scalar charge @xmath71 is generically much greater than its companion s , @xmath98 .",
    "this causes a huge deviation from gr in the orbital period variation @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , the energy flux carried out by gravitational waves is of the form @xmath99 the first curly brackets contain the prediction of general relativity , of order @xmath91 , whereas the second ones contain the extra contributions predicted in tensor - scalar theories .",
    "in particular , the dipolar contribution is of order @xmath92 , much larger than the usual quadrupole of gr if the two scalar charge are significantly different .",
    "this is the reason why the asymmetrical system psr j1141@xmath976545 is so constraining for scalar - tensor theories , although its experimental uncertainties on @xmath90 are still rather large .",
    "notice that this binary pulsar is almost as constraining as solar - system tests even in the region @xmath68 ; see fig .",
    "it should probe values of the eddington parameter @xmath100 by the end of the decade , i.e. , an order of magnitude better than present solar - system limits  ( [ cassini ] ) .",
    "the ligo and virgo interferometers will detect gravitational waves emitted by inspiralling binaries . since matter",
    "is known to be weakly coupled to the scalar field in the solar system ( small value of @xmath101 ) , these detectors will not be sensitive of the helicity-0 waves .",
    "on the other hand , the time evolution of the helicity-2 chirp does depend on the energy flux  ( [ 11 ] ) , which differs significantly from the gr prediction when the scalar charges @xmath71 , @xmath98 are nonzero .",
    "therefore , the gr wave templates used for matched filtering in ligo and virgo may not be accurate if there exists a scalar partner to the graviton , and the signal - to - noise ratio may then drop . fortunately",
    ", it was shown in @xcite that binary - pulsar data are so precise that they already exclude the models which would have predicted significant effects in the gravitational waveforms . therefore , although these interferometers are _ a priori _ more sensitive to the scalar field than classic solar - system tests , one may securely use the gr wave templates for their data analysis .",
    "on the other hand , it was shown in  @xcite that the lisa space interferometer can be sensitive to scalar effects which are still allowed by all present tests .",
    "future binary - pulsar data should nevertheless probe them before the lisa mission is launched  @xcite .    in conclusion ,",
    "solar - system tests tightly constrain the first derivative of @xmath70 ( linear matter - scalar coupling strength @xmath41 ) , whereas binary - pulsar data impose that its second derivative @xmath42 ( quadratic coupling matter - scalar - scalar ) is not large and negative .",
    "we will now see that cosmological observations give access to the full shape of this coupling function , of course not with the same accuracy as the above tests , but with the capability of constraining any higher derivative of @xmath70 ( vertex of matter with any number of scalar lines ) .",
    "moreover , cosmological data can also give access to the full shape of the potential @xmath5 .",
    "in cosmology , the usual approach to study quintessence models is to assume a particular form for the potential @xmath5 ( and the matter - scalar coupling function @xmath18 when one considers `` extended quintessence '' models ) , to compute all possible observable predictions , and to compare them to experimental data .",
    "in contrast , in the phenomenological approach , one wishes to _ reconstruct _ the lagrangian of the theory from cosmological observations .",
    "it was proved in  @xcite that the knowledge of the luminosity distance @xmath102 and of the density fluctuations @xmath103 as functions of the redshift @xmath104 indeed suffices to reconstruct both the potential @xmath5 and the coupling function @xmath18 . [",

    "the point that we wish to emphasize is that the full reconstruction of the microscopic action ( [ bdaction ] ) is theoretically possible .",
    "although it needs some algebra , this result seems anyway obvious : it is possible to _ fit _ two observed functions [ @xmath102 and @xmath107 ] thanks to two unknown ones [ @xmath5 and @xmath18 , or equivalently @xmath125 and @xmath126 ] .    however , future experiments ( like the snap satellite ) will only give access to the luminosity distance @xmath102 with a good accuracy , and the density contrast @xmath107 can not yet be used to constrain the models .",

    "but this naive reasoning is only valid locally , on a small interval .",
    "indeed , the reconstructed function may for instance diverge for some value of the redshift , or one of the degrees of freedom may need to take a negative energy beyond a given redshift , which would make the theory unstable ( and ill defined as a field theory on the surface where the energy changes its sign ) .",

    "similarly , the matter - scalar coupling function @xmath151 may have a nontrivial shape , and define a rich `` extended quintessence '' phenomenology .",
    "if the weak equivalence principle is not exactly satisfied , different species of matter , labeled @xmath152 , may have different coupling functions @xmath153 to the scalar field .",
    "it should be noted that superstring theory does predict such couplings , which violate equivalence principle tests by 9 or 10 orders of magnitude at tree level ( see j.p .",

    "the standard argument is that no symmetry protects the masses of the scalar fields , so that all of them should acquire a large enough mass at present to be exponentially suppressed , or anyway a potential such that they are very weakly coupled to matter on earth ( cf .",
    "the chameleon model  @xcite ) .",
    "however , `` flat directions '' generically arise in low - energy effective models inspired by superstrings , i.e. , one or several scalar fields which remain strictly massless and violate _ a priori _ the weak equivalence principle . in that case",
    ", string loop corrections can induce an attractor mechanism  @xcite , which efficiently drives such scalars towards an extremum of their coupling functions to matter , so that they almost decouple at present .",
    "it is also possible to couple the scalar fields to the gauss - bonnet topological invariant , @xmath154 .",
    "this is the only combination involving powers of the riemann and/or the ricci tensors which preserves the spectrum of the theory , i.e. , which does not add any extra degree of freedom .",
    "a function @xmath155 of the scalar curvature is well known to be equivalent to an extra scalar degree of freedom in the model , cf .",
    "it suffices to rewrite @xmath156 as @xmath157 $ ] and to show that the field equations deriving from these actions coincide .",
    "the latter is of the brans - dicke type ( [ bdaction ] ) , with @xmath158 , and a mere change of variables ( conformal transformation ) @xmath159 yields the canonical form  ( [ action ] ) .",
    "similarly , a function @xmath160 of the scalar curvature and its iterated dalembertian can be shown to be equivalent to the introduction of @xmath161 scalar fields in the theory  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , functions @xmath162 or @xmath163 of the ricci or the riemann tensor have been proved several times  @xcite to involve generically an extra massive spin-2 ghost , i.e. , an extra negative - energy graviton which spoils the stability of the theory .",
    "the only allowed combination is the gauss - bonnet topological invariant .",
    "finally , one may also consider a function @xmath164 of the kinetic terms , as in `` k - essence '' models  @xcite .",

    "this model will underline that solar - system and cosmological observations must be sometimes simultaneously taken into account to constrain a theory .",
    "the perturbative but highly nonlinear effects which happen can also be instructive .",
    "solar - system and binary - pulsar tests are local , and any deviation from gr depends on the magnitude of the scalar field created by a massive body .",
    "let us thus analyze first the equation satisfied by @xmath1 in the vicinity of a spherical mass @xmath172 .",
    "we can assume that the metric is close to the schwarzschild solution , and we get at the first nonvanishing order in powers of @xmath173 @xmath174\\ , \\label{boxphi}\\ ] ] where we have set @xmath175 , and where the derivative @xmath176 has been expanded in powers of @xmath1 in the right - hand side .",
    "since we are assuming that @xmath1 takes small values , let us neglect the contribution @xmath177 .",
    "we can then compute any observable prediction , but we quote below only the results for the light deflection angle ( @xmath178 ) and for the perihelion shift per orbit ( @xmath179 ) , which suffice for our purpose : @xmath180 where @xmath181 is the minimal distance between the light ray and the sun , and @xmath182 is the _ semilatus rectum _ of an orbit .",
    "the first terms on the right - hand sides are the usual gr predictions , at first order in @xmath183 . in conclusion , solar - system ( and binary - pulsar ) tests can easily be passed if @xmath184 is small enough .",
    "one can now reconstruct the full shape of @xmath170 from the cosmological observation of the luminosity distance @xmath102 , as in sec .",
    "[ reconstruction ] above .",
    "we find that this can always been done , without any problem of negative energy , contrary to what happened above for the matter - scalar coupling function @xmath18 .",
    "moreover , there exists again an attraction mechanism which drives the scalar field towards a minimum of @xmath170 during the cosmological expansion .",
    "therefore , a small value of the slope @xmath184 is indeed expected at present , consistently with what is needed for solar - system tests . in conclusion , we are faced again with a serious problem : we just found a theory which seems to be consistent with all experimental data , although it is very different from gr in its field content .",
    "our aim is therefore to find a way to distinguish it from gr , or to rule it out for internal consistency reasons .     which exactly reproduces the cosmological expansion predicted by gr plus a cosmological constant .",
    "[ fig6 ] ]    figure [ fig6 ] displays this reconstructed coupling function @xmath170 , in which the present value of the scalar field is close to the minimum at @xmath185 . its shape is nicely smooth , but its second derivative at the origin is huge if one divides it by the tiny factor @xmath186 .",
    "one gets @xmath187 , which is in fact not surprizing , since the coupling function @xmath170 behaves in action ( [ gbaction ] ) as the inverse of a cosmological constant . indeed , @xmath170 multiplies the square of the curvature tensor ,",
    "whereas the usual einstein - hilbert term involves the first power of the scalar curvature , and a cosmological constant does not multiply any curvature term at all .",
    "it was thus expected that @xmath170 involve a dimensionless number of the order of the inverse of @xmath188 .",
    "therefore , this model is ugly , but it is not yet ruled out",
    ". one should not confuse fine tuning and large ( or small ) dimensionless numbers in a model .",
    "we are here in the second situation , but there is _ a priori _ no fine tuning since the scalar field is attracted towards the minimum of @xmath170 during the cosmological expansion .",
    "there remains to study how efficiently it is attracted , but this is actually not necessary for our purpose .",
    "indeed , @xmath189 takes such a gigantic value that an approximation that we made to analyze solar - system tests is no longer valid .",
    "indeed , we have @xmath190 , so that the second term on the right - hand side of eq .  ( [ boxphi ] ) can not be neglected .",
    "to simplify the discussion , we will anyway assume that @xmath170 is parabolic , which is a good approximation in a vicinity of the minimum @xmath191 .",
    "we will thus neglect the higher order terms @xmath192 in eq .",
    "( [ boxphi ] ) ; taking them into account would not change our conclusions below .",
    "we did not find a close analytic solution to eq .",

    "this is the case if we use the huge value of @xmath189 obtained above from the cosmological reconstruction , and a typical solar - system distance for the radius @xmath195 : the argument of the hyperbolic cosine is then of order @xmath196 .",
    "the above solution is such that @xmath197 , therefore we do not find any nonperturbative effect similar to the `` spontaneous scalarization '' of neutron stars mentioned in sec .",
    "[ nonpert ] above .",
    "moreover , @xmath198 as @xmath199 , and we recover gr for distances @xmath200 ( i.e. , farther that the solar system including oort s comet cloud ) . on the other hand , there are highly nonlinear corrections proportional to @xmath201 within the solar system . since the ratio @xmath202 is much greater that @xmath203 , its successive powers blow up , but they are compensated by the factors @xmath204 which behave like the inverse of factorials . therefore , the successive terms of series ( [ phiexact ] ) start to grow exponentially , then reach a maximum for a value of the index @xmath4 which may be large , and finally tend towards zero .",
    "each of these successive terms must be assumed to be small enough for the model to pass all classical tests , but one should not forget that the largest one does not correspond to @xmath205 .    in order to study the effects of such highly nonlinear terms in the solar system , we compute their corrections to the schwarzschild metric in the form @xmath206 and we find that the light deflection angle and the perihelion shift are respectively given by @xmath207 which generalize eqs .",
    "( [ defl0])-([peri0 ] ) above .",
    "note that these results are ( independently ) perturbative in each of the coefficients @xmath208 and @xmath209 , because we are assuming that the scalar - field effects are negligible with respect to the general relativistic predictions .",
    "however , the dominant scalar - field corrections may correspond to a large value of index @xmath4 .",
    "when solution ( [ phiexact ] ) or its approximation ( [ phiapprox ] ) are used to compute the metric coefficients @xmath208 and @xmath209 in the above observable predictions , and if we use the huge value of @xmath189 obtained from the previous cosmological reconstruction of @xmath170 , we get the following experimental constraint : @xmath210 now we can speak of fine tuning , and even of _ hyperfine _ tuning !",
    "this constraint simply means that the present value of the scalar field must be _ exactly _ at the minimum of the coupling function @xmath170 , otherwise solar - system tests are violated . and",
    "since the universe is still evolving , the scalar field can not remain so close to the minimum for more than a fraction of a second .",
    "therefore , even if we assumed that @xmath211 strictly to pass solar - system tests , this would not be the case a tiny instant later . in conclusion",
    ", we managed to rule out the scalar - tensor model @xmath144 , @xmath139 and @xmath212 .",
    "it can not describe an accelerating expansion of the universe at present and pass solar - system ( and binary - pulsar ) tests at the same time .",
    "of course , this result does not rule out any scalar  gauss - bonnet coupling . a model with three ( or even two ) free functions @xmath18 , @xmath5 and @xmath170",
    "can obviously pass all present tests .",
    "[ for instance , gr plus a cosmological constant simply corresponds to @xmath213 , @xmath214 and @xmath215 . ]",
    "but the presence of a non - constant coupling @xmath170 can change the physics at small scales , notably in the very early universe ( big - bang ) and for later clustering properties .",
    "the fact that @xmath170 induces effects at small scales can be understood by a simple dimensional argument . since this function multiplies the square of the curvature in action ( [ gbaction ] ) , it induces corrections proportional to @xmath216 ( and higher orders ) to the newtonian potential in @xmath54 , and thereby generically dominates at small scales . however , we saw above that this quick reasoning can be erroneous in some perturbative but highly nonlinear situations . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath189 takes very large and _ negative _ values , the cosine involved in eq .",
    "( [ phiapprox ] ) shows that @xmath1 is always of the order of @xmath217 , even for small distances @xmath195 .",
    "one can then prove that the ( very easily satisfied ) condition @xmath218 suffices for all scalar - field effects to be negligible in the solar system , even if @xmath219 .",
    "this remark underlines that nonlinear effects can drastically change the intuitive behavior , but let us recall that our cosmological reconstruction above predicted a large and _ positive _ value for @xmath189 . in that case",
    ", we did find that the scalar  gauss - bonnet coupling induces large effects at small scales , and even exponentially larger than the linear results ( [ defl0])-([peri0 ] ) .",

    "binary - pulsar data forbid large and negative values of its second derivative @xmath42 ( quadratic matter - scalar - scalar coupling ) .",
    "the knowledge of the two cosmological functions @xmath102 and @xmath107 suffices to reconstruct the full shape of both @xmath18 and the potential @xmath5 on a finite interval of @xmath1 .",
    "the knowledge of the luminosity distance @xmath102 alone over a _ wide _ redshift interval strongly constrains the theories if one takes into account solar - system ( and binary - pulsar ) data , the positivity of the graviton and scalar energies , and the stability and naturalness of the models .",
    "future data , provided by experiments like the snap satellite , will notably allow us to discriminate between gr plus a cosmological constant and a potential - free scalar - tensor theory .",
