    "* ) . what s more",
    ", collision products have a significant probability of undergoing more than one collision during a given single - binary or binary - binary interaction since the initial impact is expected to result in shock heating followed by adiabatic expansion , increasing the cross section for a second collision to occur ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "several types of stars whose origins remain a mystery are speculated to be the products of stellar mergers .",
    "blue stragglers ( bss ) in particular are thought to be produced via the addition of fresh hydrogen to the cores of low - mass main - sequence ( ms ) stars .",
    "recent evidence has shown that , whatever the dominant bs formation mechanism(s ) operating in both globular and open clusters , it is likely to in some way depend on binary stars @xcite .",
    "the currently favored mechanisms include collisions during single - binary and binary - binary encounters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , mass transfer between the components of a binary system ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the coalescence of two stars in a close binary due to perturbations from an orbiting triple companion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a handful of spectroscopic studies have revealed that in some gcs there exist bss with masses exceeding twice that of the ms turn - off ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such massive bss must have been formed from the mergers of two or more low - mass ms stars since they are too massive to have been formed from mass transfer . in a few cases , this",
    "can also be argued for entire bs populations using photometry .",
    "for instance , @xcite performed detailed binary evolution calculations to study dynamical stability during mass transfer from an evolving giant star onto a ms companion . based on their results",
    ", it can arguably be inferred that most bss in ngc 188 are sufficiently bright that they probably could not have formed from mass transfer alone .",
    "if true , this suggests that most of these bss must be the products of stellar meregers .",
    "regardless of the dominant bs formation mechanism(s ) operating in dense star clusters , dynamical interactions should play at least some role .",
    "for example , even if blue stragglers are formed as a result of binary evolution processes such as mass transfer , the progenitor binaries themselves should have been affected by at least one dynamical interaction over the course of their lifetime .",
    "numerous scattering experiments have been performed to explore the outcomes of binary - binary and , in particular , single - binary encounters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "most of the earliest of these studies were performed in the point - particle limit , ignoring altogether the often non - negligible implications of the stars finite sizes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "later , more realistic simulations clearly demonstrated the importance of taking into account the dissipative effects of tidal interactions and direct contact between stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result of the increased number of free parameters for the encounters and the longer integration times required to run the simulations to completion , few studies have been conducted to explore the outcomes of binary - binary encounters or interactions involving triple systems .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce an analytic technique to constrain the most probable dynamical origin of an observed binary or triple system containing one or more merger products .",
    "provided the observed system is found within a moderately dense cluster environment with binary and/or triple fractions of at least a few percent , the probability is often high that it formed from a merger during an encounter involving one or more binary or triple stars . in section  [ method ] , we present an equation for energy conservation during individual stellar encounters and outline the process for applying our technique .",
    "specifically , we present a step - by - step methodology to evaluate whether or not an assumed dynamical history could have realistically produced an observed system and describe how to determine the most probable dynamical formation scenario . in section  [ results ] , we apply our technique to a few observed binary and triple systems thought to contain merger products , in particular a triple system that is thought to contain two bss and the peculiar period - eccentricity distribution of the bs binary population in ngc 188 . we discuss the implications of our results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "in this section , we present a general prescription for conservation of energy during stellar encounters . we will limit the discussion to typical interactions thought to occur in globular and old open clusters , although our technique can be generalized to any choice of parameter space .",
    "the types of encounters of interest in this paper will predominantly involve low - mass ms stars with relative velocities at infinity ranging from @xmath0 km / s to @xmath1 km / s ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "our technique describes how to isolate the most probable dynamical formation history for an observed binary or triple containing one or more merger products by providing an estimate for the time required for a given interaction to occur in a realistic cluster environment .",
    "we begin by assuming that an observed system was formed directly from a dynamical interaction ( or sequence of interactions ) . in this case",
    ", the observed parameters of the system provide the final distribution of energies for the system resulting from the interaction(s ) . after choosing an appropriate dynamical scenario ( i.e. whether the objects involved in the interaction(s ) are single , binary or triple stars )",
    ", we can work backwards using energy conservation to constrain the initial energies going into the encounter .",
    "this provides an estimate for the initial orbital energies and therefore semi - major axes of any binaries or triples going into the interaction .",
    "this in turn gives the cross section for collision and hence the time required for the hypothesized interaction(s ) to occur .",
    "since the formation event must have happened in the last @xmath2 years , where @xmath2 is the lifetime of the merger product , a formation scenario is likely only if the derived encounter time - scale is shorter than the lifetime of the merger product(s ) .",
    "conversely , if the derived encounter time - scale is longer than the lifetime of the merger product(s ) , then that dynamical formation scenario is unlikely to have occurred in the last @xmath2 years . in general , the shorter the derived encounter time - scale , the more likely it is that one or more such encounters actually took place within the lifetime of the merger product(s ) .",
    "finally , if the derived encounter time - scale is longer than @xmath2 for every possible dynamical formation scenario , then a dynamical origin is altogether unlikely for an observed multiple star system containing one or more bss . either that , or the encounter time - scales must have been shorter in the recent past ( or , equivalently , the central cluster density must have been higher ) .",
    "consider an encounter in which at least one of the two bodies involved is a binary or triple star .",
    "though a complex exchange of energies occurs , energy must ultimately be conserved in any dynamical interaction .",
    "the total energy that goes into the encounter must therefore be equal to the total energy contained in the remaining configuration : @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the total number of stars , objects ( single , binary , triple or even quadruple stars ) and orbits , respectively , that went into the encounter .",
    "similarly , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the total number of stars , objects and orbits remaining after the encounter .",
    "we let @xmath10 represent the bulk rotational kinetic energy in star @xmath11 , which is a function of the star s moment of inertia @xmath12 and angular rotation rate @xmath13 : @xmath14 the moment of inertia is in turn a function of the density profile within a star , which changes along with its internal structure and composition as the star evolves .",
    "the moment of inertia is given by @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radius of gyration .",
    "for example , a typical 1 m@xmath17 star in an old open cluster having an age of @xmath18 6 gyrs has @xmath19 . for comparison , a 1 m@xmath17 star in a typical milky way gc having an age of @xmath18 11 gyrs has @xmath20 @xcite .",

    ", the gravitational binding energy is given by : @xmath30 where the parameter @xmath31 is chosen to reflect the structure of the star and is therefore a function of its mass , age and chemical composition .",

    "11 gyrs has @xmath34 @xcite . roughly regardless of age",
    ", this gives @xmath35 joules for a 1 m@xmath17 star with a radius of 1 r@xmath17 .",
    "we let @xmath36 represent the total internal energy contained in star @xmath11",
    "( i.e. the star s thermal energy arising from the random motions of its particles ) . by solving the equations of stellar structure ,",
    "the total internal energy of a purely isolated single star is uniquely determined by its mass , initial composition and age .",
    "stars are made up of a more or less virialized fluid so that , ignoring magnetic fields , the gravitational binding energy of a star in hydrostatic equilibrium is about twice its internal thermal energy @xcite . using this version of the virial theorem , a 1 m@xmath17 star having a radius of 1 r@xmath17 has @xmath37 joules .    the total translational kinetic energy of object @xmath38 ( single , binary , triple , etc .",
    "star ) is represented by @xmath39 : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the total mass of the object , and @xmath42 is its bulk translational speed .",
    "the translational velocities of stars in clusters for which energy equipartition has been achieved as a result of two - body relaxation obey a maxwell - boltzmann distribution , with the heaviest stars typically having the lowest velocities and vice versa @xcite . according to the virial theorem",
    ", the root - mean - square velocity @xmath43 of the distribution depends on the total mass of the cluster @xmath44 .",
    "it follows that the velocities of stars in a fully relaxed cluster are approximately determined by their mass and the total mass of the cluster . assuming that the typical velocity of a @xmath45 star is roughly equal to @xmath43 , where @xmath45 is the average stellar mass in the cluster , energy equipartition can be invoked in some clusters to approximate the translational kinetic energy , and hence velocity , of a star or binary of mass @xmath41 : @xmath46 we note that equation  [ eqn : v - typ ] can only be applied in clusters for which the half - mass relaxation time is much shorter than the cluster lifetime . at the same time",
    ", the tidal truncation of the velocity distribution must not be significant .",
    "we will return to this in section  [ general ] .",
    "for a 1 m@xmath17 star with a translational speed of 1 km s@xmath21 ( typical of stars in old open clusters ) , we find @xmath47 joules . for comparison ,",
    "the same star traveling at a speed of 10 km s@xmath21 ( typical of stars in globular clusters ) has @xmath48 joules .",
    "we can put this into perspective by equating equation  [ eqn : trans ] with equation  [ eqn : binding ] , which shows that a direct collision between two 1 m@xmath17 stars would require an impact velocity of @xmath18 1000 km s@xmath21 in order to completely unbind the merger remnant .",
    "the total orbital energy of orbit @xmath49 is denoted @xmath50 , and is given by : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the reduced mass of the orbit , @xmath53 is the total mass and @xmath54 is the orbital semi - major axis . a binary composed of two 1 m@xmath17 stars with a period of 1000 days has @xmath55 joules . for comparison , an otherwise identical binary with a period of 1 day has @xmath56 joules .",
    "since most stable triples are observed to have outer periods of @xmath18 1000 days with close inner binaries @xcite , it follows that the total orbital energies of stable triples will be dominated by the orbital energies of their inner binaries .",
    "after the encounter occurs , the energies that collectively define the state of the newly formed system include the rotational kinetic ( @xmath57 ) , thermal ( @xmath58 ) and gravitational binding ( @xmath59 ) energies of the stars that are left - over , as well as the total translational kinetic ( @xmath60 ) and orbital ( @xmath61 ) energies of any left - over stars , binaries or triples .",
    "the internal and gravitational binding energies of the left - over stars once again depend on their mass , composition and age .",
    "the mass , composition and evolutionary status of a star will decide how it responds to tidal interactions ( and therefore how much tidal energy is deposited ) since these are the principal factors that determine its internal structure , in particular whether or not its envelope is radiative or convective @xcite . finally , we let @xmath62 represent the energy lost from the system due to radiation and mass loss",
    ". we do not expect this term to be significant for the majority of the encounters we will consider since the rate of mass - loss from low - mass ms stars is small and the time - scales under consideration are relatively short compared to the lifetimes of the stars .",
    "moreover , the velocity dispersions characteristic of the clusters we will consider are sufficiently small that we expect most collisions to have a relatively low impact velocity . though significant mass loss can occur for high impact collisions as often occur in the galactic centre , mass loss is only @xmath63 5% for the low impact velocity collisions expected to occur in open and globular clusters @xcite .",
    "therefore , we will henceforth assume @xmath64 .",
    "depending on the initial parameters of the encounter , one or more terms in equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ] can often be neglected .",
    "for example , given that the rotational energies of typical ms stars in both open and globular clusters are several orders of magnitude smaller than the other terms in equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ] , we can neglect these terms for the types of encounters of interest .",
    "even a 1 m@xmath17 star rotating at a rate of 100 km s@xmath21 has a rotational energy of only @xmath65 joules .",
    "this is considerably higher than even the highest rotation rates observed for both bss and normal ms stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from this",
    ", we expect typical rotational energies to be significantly smaller than the orbital energies of even moderately hard binaries .",
    "furthermore , equation  [ eqn : trans ] can be combined with equation  [ eqn : v - typ ] and equated to equation  [ eqn : orbital ] in order to define the hard - soft boundary for a given cluster .",
    "if a binary is hard , its initial orbital energy will outweigh its initial translational kinetic energy during typical stellar encounters @xcite .",
    "we do not expect soft binaries to survive for very long in dynamically - active clusters @xcite ( i.e. most binaries are hard ) , so that the translational kinetic energies of the stars , binaries and triples typically found in ocs can usually be neglected when applying equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ] .",
    "this suggests @xmath66 .",
    "however , the final translational kinetic energies of the stars , binaries and triples left - over should not be neglected for encounter outcomes in which one or more stars are ejected with very high velocities .",
    "this can leave the remaining stars in a much more tightly bound configuration since stars ejected with high velocities carry off significant amounts of energy .",
    "finally , provided there are no very high impact collisions and tides dissipate a negligible amount of energy from the system , we also expect that : @xmath67    we can simplify our energy conservation prescription considerably for the majority of encounters occurring in old ocs . neglecting the rotational kinetic energies of the stars ,",
    "equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ] becomes : @xmath68 where we have assumed @xmath66 and @xmath69 is the amount of energy deposited in any merger products formed during the encounter . in other words ,",
    "the term @xmath69 provides the required correction to equation  [ eqn : int - conserv ] resulting from internal energy being deposited in the merger product(s ) as a result of collisions and tides .",
    "if no mergers occur or all of the orbital energy of the merging binary is imparted to the other interacting stars , @xmath70 .",
    "both the total linear and angular momenta must also be conserved during any dynamical interaction .",
    "this provides two additional constraints that must also be satisfied , however the total linear and angular momenta are vector quantities that depend on the angle of approach as well as the relative orientations of the objects . as a result , there are more free parameters to fit when trying to constrain the initial parameters of an encounter using conservation of linear and angular momentum . therefore , it is considerably more difficult to extract information pertaining to the initial orbital parameters of an encounter using conservation of momentum than it is with conservation of energy .",
    "we have assumed that exchange interactions do not occur in applying our technique .",
    "clearly , this assumption could be invalid for some systems .",
    "if this is the case , then our method is also invalid .",
    "this suggests that our technique is ideally suited to clusters for which the encounter time - scales are comparable to the lifetime of a typical merger product .",
    "this maximizes the probability that bss do not experience any subsequent dynamical interactions after they are formed . of course",
    ", most clusters of interest are unlikely to satisfy this criterion",
    ". we can assess the probability that an exchange encounter has occurred for a particular system by calculating the different encounter time - scales and comparing to the lifetime of the merger product .",
    "if the time - scales are sufficiently short , then the possibility of an exchange interaction having occurred after the system s formation must be properly addressed .",
    "we will discuss this further in section  [ discussion ] .      in this section ,",
    "we outline a step - by - step methodology to constrain realistic dynamical formation scenarios that could have resulted in the production of an observed stellar system containing one or more merger products .",
    "these steps are :    1 .",
    "we must first find _ qualitative _ constraints for the system s dynamical history and , in so doing , converge on the most probable formation scenario .",
    "the choice of formation history should be guided by the observed properties of the binary or triple system containing the merger product(s ) .",
    "the following guidelines can be applied to find the most probable scenario . + first , the analytic rates for single - single ( 1 + 1 ) , single - binary ( 1 + 2 ) , single - triple ( 1 + 3 ) , binary - binary ( 2 + 2 ) , binary - triple ( 2 + 3 ) and triple - triple ( 3 + 3 ) encounters can be compared to obtain a rough guide as to which of these encounter types will dominate in a given cluster",
    ". the total rate of encounters of a given type in a cluster core is well approximated by @xcite ( see appendix  [ appendix ] for a more generalized form for this equation ) : @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number of single , binary or triple stars in the core and @xmath73 is the mean stellar , binary or triple number density in the core .",
    "the gravitationally - focused cross section for collision @xmath74 is given by equation 6 of @xcite .",

    "assuming for simplicity that @xmath81 is roughly equal for all types of encounters , the rates for two types of encounters can be compared to find the parameter space for which one type of encounter will dominate over another .",
    "these relations can be plotted in the @xmath82 plane in order to partition the parameter space for which each of the various encounter types will occur with the greatest frequency , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : fb - ft ] .",
    "given a cluster s binary and triple fractions , this provides a simple means of finding the type of encounter that will occur with the greatest frequency .",
    "our results are in rough agreement with those of @xcite who found that single - binary interactions dominate over binary - binary interactions in clusters having core binary fractions @xmath83 , and may dominate for @xmath79 up to 0.25 - 0.5 in some cases .",

    "boundaries between regions are indicated by solid lines , each segment of which is obtained by equating two particular encounter rates using equation  [ eqn : coll - rate ] and the relevant cross sections derived using equation 6 of @xcite .",
    "we assume @xmath84 and @xmath85 in obtaining the relations between encounter rates .",
    "this is a reasonable choice for the ratio between the average binary and triple geometric cross sections given that the ratio between the outer and inner orbital semi - major axes of triples must be relatively large ( by a factor of @xmath86 10 ) in order for them to be stable @xcite .",

    "this assumes that @xmath90 has not changed significantly since the dynamical formation of the system , which should be valid provided the merger products are significantly more massive than the turn - off so that their lifetimes are relatively short .",
    "the number of stars that went into an encounter @xmath4 must therefore satisfy : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the number of normal stars ( i.e. not formed from mergers ) and @xmath93 denotes the number of merger products .",
    "+ third , an estimate for the average stellar mass , and therefore the masses of typical stars expected to undergo encounters , should be guided by a realistic stellar mass function for the host cluster .",
    "first of all , observations have shown that a significant depletion of low - mass stars occurs in dynamically evolved clusters ( i.e. those for which @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the half - mass relaxation time and @xmath96 is the cluster age ) since they are preferentially ejected from the cluster during close encounters ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "finally , most of the stars involved in dynamical encounters should have masses close to or even slightly greater than the average stellar mass @xmath45 .",
    "this is because gravitational focusing is strongest for the most massive objects , contributing to a shorter encounter time - scale .",
    "+ finally , the most likely formation scenario will , strictly speaking , minimize the total or cumulative encounter time - scale .",
    "however , the total time - scale required for a dynamical formation scenario that involves more than one encounter will typically be dominated by the second encounter .",
    "this is because , after an initial encounter has occurred between any two suitable objects to form a new stellar configuration , the time - scale for a second encounter to occur is given by the time required for the product of the initial encounter to experience a subsequent encounter .",

    "radial velocity measurements also provide an estimate for the systemic velocity of the final stellar configuration relative to the cluster mean , which in turn gives its translational kinetic energy @xmath103 according to equation  [ eqn : trans ] .",

    "although both the inner and outer components of this suspected triple have systemic velocites that suggest they are both cluster members , it is important to note that there is no direct evidence proving a dynamical link between the two @xcite .",

    "in doing so , we find that it is not possible to form s1082 with a single 2 + 3 encounter .",

    "although very few observational constraints for the fraction of quadruple systems in clusters exist , this seems unlikely .",
    "+ the orbital energies of the inner binaries of the two triples initially going into the encounter should both be on the order of @xmath142 j. although we have found that only one hard binary with @xmath143 j is required , triples are only dynamically stable if the ratio of their inner to outer orbital periods is large ( roughly a factor of ten or more ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we do not expect very wide binaries to survive for very long in dense cluster environments , which suggests that the inner binary of every triple is very hard .",
    "we expect from this that these inner binaries should , to within an order of magnitude , all have roughly the same orbital energy . + the presence of outer triple companions is required in order for most very hard binaries to actually experience encounters within the lifetime of a typical merger product .",
    "assuming masses of 1 m@xmath17 for both components , an orbital energy of @xmath142 j corresponds to a period @xmath144 days , or a semi - major axis @xmath145 au .",
    "therefore , the cross section for collision for a 2 + 2 encounter in which both binaries are very hard is smaller than the average cross section for a 2 + 2 encounter ( found from the observed binary period distribution ) by a factor of @xmath146 .",
    "this suggests that the time required for an encounter to occur between two very hard binaries is considerably longer than the cluster lifetime .",
    "this is not the case if the hard binaries have triple companions , however , since the outer orbit significantly increases the collisional cross section and hence decreases the encounter time - scale .",
    "+ energy conservation also suggests that if s1082 did form from a single 3 + 3 encounter , it is likely that the close inner binaries of the two triples collided directly .",
    "if two separate mergers then subsequently occurred during this interaction , this could have reproduced the observed orbital parameters of the close inner binary of s1082 ( component a ) .",
    "the formation of the outer triple companion is more difficult to explain via a single 3 + 3 encounter since it also appears to be the product of a stellar merger . nonetheless , if the outer companions of both triples undergoing the encounter end up orbiting the interacting ( or merged ) pair of close inner binaries at comparable distances , it is possible that their orbits would overlap as a result of gravitational focussing .",
    "although this seems unlikely , it could produce a blue straggler of the right mass and orbital period to account for component b. we will return to this possibility in section  [ discussion ] .    even though the analytic estimates presented here are only approximate , they serve to highlight the low probability of a system such as s1082 having formed dynamically in m67 .",
    "based on our results , the most likely formation scenario for s1082 is a single 3 + 3 encounter , although we expect very few , if any , to have occurred in the lifetime of a typical merger product .",
    "this need not be the case , however , provided m67 had a higher central density in the recent past since this would increase the total encounter frequency .",

    "stable triples also have a large cross section for collision because of the wide orbit of the tertiary companion . the times between 1 + 2 ,",
    "2 + 2 and 1 + 3 encounters are all comparable , suggesting that most encounters involving hard binaries are 1 + 3 encounters .",

    "if at least one of the objects going into the encounter was a triple , then four or more stars were involved in the interaction . therefore ,",
    "if binaries 5078 and 7782 were formed from this mechanism , they could possess triple companions with sufficiently long periods that they would have thus far evaded detection .",

    "in this case , equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ] shows that tides can contribute to making a binary s orbital energy more negative by depositing internal energy into the component stars .",
    "+ although 2 + 2 encounters should also contribute to the observed bs population , most of these should occur between a short - period binary and a long - period binary .",
    "this is because most encounters resulting in mergers involve very hard binaries and binaries with long periods have large cross sections for collision and therefore short encounter times .",
    "equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv2 ] indicates that the minimum period of a bs binary formed during a 2 + 2 encounter is usually determined by the orbital energy of the softest binary going into the encounter .",

    "this is because the hard binary merges so that its significant ( negative ) orbital energy can only be re - distributed to the other stars by giving them positive energy .",
    "since the only other orbits involved in the interaction are wide , the left - over bs binary should also have a wide orbit .",
    "alternatively , bss formed during interactions involving more than one very hard binary should be left in a wide binary provided enough energy is extracted from the orbit of the binary that merges . in this case , a significant fraction of this energy must be imparted to the other stars in order to counter - balance the significant orbital energy of the other very hard binary . if not , the other short - period binaries are required to either merge or be ejected from the system .",
    "otherwise equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv2 ] suggests that the left - over bs binary should be very hard .",

    "we will return to this last point in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "+ in order to help us obtain more quantitative estimates for the long - period bs binaries , consider two additional mechanisms for mergers during dynamical interactions that involve both short- and long - period orbits .",
    "first , a merger can occur if a sufficient amount of orbital energy is extracted from a hard binary by other interacting stars ( called mechanism iia ) .",
    "alternatively , a merger can occur if the encounter progresses in such a way that the eccentricity of a hard binary becomes sufficiently increased that the stellar radii overlap , causing the stars to collide and merge ( called mechanism iib ) . in the case of mechanism iib , most of the orbital energy of the close binary must end up in the form of internal and gravitational binding energy in the merger remnant after the majority of its orbital angular momentum has been redistributed to the other stars ( and tides have extracted orbital energy ) . in the case of mechanism iia , however , most of the orbital energy of the close binary must be imparted to one or more of the other interacting stars in the form of bulk kinetic motion .",
    "consequently , one or more stars are likely to obtain a positive total energy and escape the system .",
    "this need not necessarily be the case for 2 + 3 and 3 + 3 encounters provided the second hardest binary orbit involved in the interaction has a sufficiently negative energy .",
    "+ regardless of the type of encounter , equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv2 ] shows that the extraction of orbital energy from a hard binary in stimulating it to merge should increase the final orbital period of a bs binary . to illustrate this",
    ", we will consider 1 + 3 encounters since the predictions of energy conservation are nearly identical for the other encounter types of interest .",
    "moreoever , we have shown that encounters with triples are the most likely to involve very hard binaries .",
    "equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv2 ] can be re - written for 1 + 3 encounters : @xmath166 where we have assumed that stars 1 and 2 comprise the initial hard inner binary of the triple , star 3 is the initial outer triple companion and star 4 is the interloping single star .",
    "stars 1 and 2 are assumed to merge during the encounter by exchanging energy and angular momentum with stars 3 and 4 .",
    "we further assume that enough energy is imparted to star 3 that it escapes the system .",
    "we let @xmath167 represent the fraction of energy extracted from the orbital energy of the hard inner binary of the triple in the form of bulk kinetic motion by star 4 .",
    "since the remaining orbital energy of the close inner binary will end up in the form of internal and gravitational binding energy in the merger remnant , we have assumed @xmath168 in obtaining equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv3 ] from equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv2 ] .",
    "+ this formation mechanism could leave the bs as a single star if @xmath167 exceeds a few percent .",

    "[ fig : sintri ] ] + interestingly , the two general qualitative merger scenarios described above ( mechanisms i and ii ) naturally create a bi - modal period distribution similar to the period gap observed for the bs binaries if we assume that 1 + 3 encounters produced these objects . to illustrate this , figure  [ fig : per - num ] shows a histogram of periods for 15 bs binaries formed during 1 + 3 encounters via these two generic merger scenarios . in order to obtain this plot , we have used the observed period - eccentricity distribution for the regular ms - ms binary population in ngc 188 from @xcite to obtain estimates for the orbital energies of any binaries and/or triples going into encounters .",
    "specifically , in order to obtain periods for the outer orbits of triples undergoing encounters , we randomly sampled the regular period distribution , including only those binaries with periods satisfying @xmath178 days @xmath179 days .",
    "we have shown that the initial outer orbits of triples going into 1 + 3 encounters provide a rough lower limit for the periods of bs binaries formed via mechanism ii .",
    "therefore , any bs binaries formed in this way could only have been identified as binaries by radial velocity surveys if the triple going into the encounter had a period @xmath180 days ( since this corresponds to the current cut - off for detection ) .",
    "all triples are taken to have a ratio of 30 between their inner and outer orbital semi - major axes .",
    "this ratio has been chosen to be arbitrarily large enough that the triples should be dynamically stable , however we will return to this assumption in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "+ we will adopt a ratio based on the observations of @xcite for the fraction of outcomes that result in each of these two possible merger scenarios .",
    "in particular , if we assume that the three bs binaries with @xmath181 days were formed via mechanism i whereas the other 12 were formed via mechanism ii ( either iia or iib since energy conservation predicts similar periods for the left - over bs binaries ) , this would suggest that mechanism ii is @xmath182 times more likely to occur than mechanism i during any given 1 + 3 encounter .",
    "we will return to this assumption in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "+ ] + as a result of the requirement for conservation of angular momentum , we would expect to see a large spread in the distribution of eccentricities for bss in long - period binaries formed from encounters involving triples .",
    "this is because conservation of momentum requires that the total momentum going into the encounter must be equal to the total momentum left over after the interaction .",
    "however , the total initial momentum depends not only on the initial orbital eccentricities of any binaries or triples going into the encounter , but also the relative orientations and trajectories of the colliding objects .",
    "since the relative orientations and trajectories are random , the final eccentricities of the bs binaries can take on a range of values .",
    "in other words , we can not predict the final distribution of momenta for bs binaries formed from dynamical encounters .",
    "however , the observed bs binaries in ngc 188 are observed to have a range of eccentricities and this is not inconsistent with a dynamical origin involving triples .",
    "+ bss in short - period binaries formed via mechanism i can also end up with just about any eccentricity immediately after the encounter for the same reasons outlined above .",
    "however , tidal effects become increasingly significant with decreasing orbital separation so that the hardest binaries should typically circularize the fastest .",
    "although theoretical estimates for the rate of tidal circularization are uncertain @xcite , the circularization cut - off period is estimated to be @xmath18 15 days in ngc 188 @xcite . from this , it is entirely possible that recently formed bs binaries with p @xmath18 10 days have not yet become fully circularized .",
    "in this paper , we have presented a generalized analytic prescription for energy conservation during stellar encounters .",
    "our method can be used to identify the most probable dynamical formation scenario for an observed binary or triple system containing one or more merger products .",
    "we have shown that , using the observed orbital parameters of the system , the allowed initial orbital semi - major axes of any binary or triple systems involved in its formation can be constrained .",
    "the initial semi - major axes of the orbits in turn provide an estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time - scale for the encounter to occur in its host cluster . in order to apply our technique , repeated spectroscopic measurements of the binary or triple system containing the merger product(s ) are needed in order to obtain its orbital solution and systemic velocity .",
    "however , the time - scales provided in appendix  [ appendix ] can still be applied if only the fraction of binary and triple stars are known , which can be determined either spectroscopically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) or photometrically ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as we have shown , consideration of the requirement for energy conservation is ideal for identifying trends during stellar encounters , whereas numerical scattering experiments can require hundreds or even thousands of simulation runs before patterns will emerge .",
    "some of these trends include :    * at least one short - period binary is usually required in a dynamical interaction to produce another binary having a similarly short - period ( provided no stars are ejected with escape velocities @xmath141 km / s ) .",
    "this is because the orbital energy of a short - period binary is sufficiently negative that it tends to considerably outweigh the other energy terms in equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ] for most of the encounters that typically occur in the cores of globular and especially open clusters .",
    "this has been confirmed by @xcite . *",
    "previous studies have found that in order for triples to remain stable for many dynamical times , the ratio of their inner to outer orbital periods must be relatively large ( roughly a factor of ten or more ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "based on our results , this has two important corollaries for stellar mergers in dense cluster environments hosting a significant population of triples : 1 .",
    "the longest - lived triples will contain very hard inner binaries with a large @xmath183 .",
    "this is important since stellar radii are in general more likely to overlap and hence mergers to occur during resonant interactions involving very hard binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we therefore expect stellar mergers to be common during encounters involving stable triple systems .",
    "2 .   the longest - lived triples will contain wide outer orbits , creating a large cross section for collision .",
    "this suggests that the time - scale required for a stable triple system to encounter another object is typically short relative to the cluster age in dense environments .",
    "a significant fraction of encounters involving very hard binaries , and hence resulting in stellar mergers , will therefore involve triples in old open clusters such as m67 and ngc 188 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite suggest that back - to - back binary - binary encounters , or even a single 3 + 3 encounter , could have formed s1082 .",
    "we have improved upon these previous studies by estimating time - scales required for possible dynamical formation scenarios to occur . since we have argued in section  [ results ] that the formation of s1082 must have involved at least 6 stars",
    ", it follows that only a 3 + 3 interaction could have reproduced the observed configuration via a single encounter .",
    "however , the derived 3 + 3 encounter time - scale is sufficiently long that we expect very few , if any , 3 + 3 encounters occurred within the lifetime of a typical merger product .",
    "moreover , we have argued that the times for multiple encounters to occur are longer than the cluster age . although we can not rule out a dynamical origin for s1082",
    ", our results suggest that it is unlikely ( provided the derived encounter time - scales were not significantly higher in the recent past , which we will return to below ) . from this",
    ", it follows that a dynamical link between the close binary and third star is unlikely to exist .    on the other hand ,",
    "we have so far ignored the cluster evolution , and assumed that the currently observed cluster parameters have not changed in the last few gyrs .",
    "n - body models suggest that the central density in m67 could have been significantly higher in the recent past .",
    "specifically , figure 5 of @xcite indicates that the presently observed central density in m67 could have been higher within the past gyr by a factor of @xmath184 . if this was indeed the case , our previous estimates for each of the different encounter frequencies should increase by a factor of @xmath182 , so that a significant number of dynamical encounters involving single , binary and triple stars should have occurred in m67 within the last @xmath2 years .",
    "it follows that a dynamical origin for s1082 is not unlikely if the central density in m67 was recently larger than its presently observed value by a factor of @xmath184 .",
    "this also increases the probability that a scenario involving multiple encounters created s1082 , although we have shown that such a scenario is still likely to have involved one or more triples .",
    "based on the preceding arguments , s1082 offers an excellent example of how observations of individual multiple star systems containing bss can be used to directly constrain the dynamical history of their host cluster .",
    "if a definitive dynamical link between components a and b is established , this would suggest that the central density in m67 was higher in the last 1 - 2 gyrs .",
    "this is also required in order for the cluster dynamics to have played a role in the formation of a significant fraction of the observed bs population in m67 .",
    "based on the current density , the encounter time - scales are sufficiently long that too few encounters should have occurred in the last @xmath2 years for mergers during dynamical interactions to be a significant contributor to bs formation .",
    "we have obtained quantitative constraints for two generic channels for mergers during encounters involving triples ",
    "one in which a direct stellar collision occurs within a dynamical interaction of the hard inner binary of a triple and another single or ( hard ) binary star ( mechanism i ) and one in which the hard inner binary of a triple is driven to coalesce by imparting energy and/or angular momentum to other stars involved in the interaction ( mechanism ii ) .",
    "our results suggest that these two general merger mechanisms could contribute to a bi - modal period distribution for bs binaries similar to that observed in ngc 188 .",
    "these dual mechanisms predict a gap in period , with those bs binaries formed via mechanism i having periods of a few to @xmath185 days and those formed via mechanism ii having periods closer to @xmath147 days .",
    "some 2 + 2 , 2 + 3 and even 1 + 3 encounters could involve orbits with periods in this range , and equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv2 ] confirms that the final period of a bs binary formed via mechanism ii will typically be determined by that of the second hardest binary orbit .",
    "therefore , we might still expect some bs binaries to have periods that fall in the gap ( 100 days @xmath63 p @xmath63 1000 days ) .",
    "our results do indeed predict one such bs binary , as shown in figure  [ fig : per - num ] .",
    "a number of assumptions went into obtaining figure  [ fig : per - num ] , many of which were chosen specifically to reproduce the observed bs binary period distribution .",
    "regardless , our assumptions were chosen to reflect encounter scenarios that are the most likely to result in mergers .",
    "these should involve triples with very hard inner binaries since these are the most likely to merge during encounters .",
    "the triples should also have outer companions on very wide orbits since these have the largest cross sections for collision . from this ,",
    "we have assumed a ratio of 30 between the inner and outer semi - major axes of all triples .",
    "this ensures that all triples are dynamically stable .",
    "this also leads us to assume a minimum period of @xmath178 days for the outer orbits of triples so that the corresponding minimum period of their inner orbits is not too small .",
    "these assumptions serve to show that encounters involving triples could produce both long - period and short - period bs binaries as well as a period gap .",
    "our results predict that the short - period peak in figure  [ fig : per - num ] is at a slightly longer period than the observations suggest .",
    "if we decrease the assumed ratio between the inner and outer orbital separations of triples , the short - period peak will move to even longer periods . however , if one or more stars were ejected with a high escape velocity or the dissipative effects of tides are considered ( which are expected to be the most significant for encounters involving hard binaries ) this would move the short - period peak to even shorter periods . in order to obtain the desired agreement with the observations at the short - period end of the bs period distribution , energy must have somehow been dissipated or removed from the hard inner binaries of the triples during ( or even after ) the encounter , or the inner binaries",
    "must have initially been even harder than we have assumed in obtaining figure  [ fig : per - num ] .",
    "our results could suggest that the hard bs binaries in ngc 188 ( binaries 5078 and 7782 ) may have outer triple companions , perhaps with sufficiently long periods that they would have thus far evaded detection .",
    "this is consistent with the requirement for energy conservation since the orbital energy of the outer orbit of the triple is negligible compared to that of its inner binary .",
    "if binaries 5078 and 7782 do have outer triple companions , it is also possible that kozai oscillations combined with tidal friction contributed to decreasing their orbital periods @xcite .",
    "finally , the bs binaries in ngc 188 are observed to have a wide range of eccentricities , which we have argued is not inconsistent with a dynamical origin involving triples .",
    "we have assumed that mechanism ii is more likely to occur than mechanism i during any given 1 + 3 encounter .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since numerical scattering experiments of 1 + 2 and 2 + 2 encounters have shown that the coalescence of a hard binary is much more likely to occur during an encounter than a direct collision between a hard binary and an interacting single or binary star ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio we have assumed for the frequencies with which mechanisms i and ii occur was specifically chosen in order to reproduce the observed numbers of short- and long - period bs binaries .",
    "the important point to take away is that the observed bs binary period - eccentricity distribution offers a potential constraint on the fraction of encounters that result in different merger scenarios .",
    "based on our results , mechanism ii must occur @xmath182 times more often than mechanism i in order to reproduce the observed bs period distribution from 1 + 3 encounters ( or , equivalently , 2 + 3 encounters involving a very wide binary and 2 + 2 encounters between a short - period binary and a long - period binary ) .",
    "this can be tested by performing numerical scattering experiments of encounters involving triples .",
    "therefore , our results highlight the need for simulations of 1 + 3 , 2 + 3 and 3 + 3 encounters to be performed in order to better understand their expected contributions to bs populations in open and globular clusters .",
    "once a preferred encounter scenario has been identified for an observed binary or triple containing one or more bss , numerical scattering experiments can be used to further constrain the conditions under which that scenario will occur ( or to show that it can not occur ) .",
    "we have demonstrated that a combination of observational and analytic constraints can be used to isolate the parameter space relevant to the dynamical formation of an observed multiple star system ( or population of star systems ) containing one or more merger products .",
    "this will drastically narrow the relevant parameter space for numerical scattering experiments .",
    "we have improved upon the results of @xcite and @xcite since we have shown that dynamical encounters involving triples could not only be contributing to the long - period bs binaries in ngc 188 , but they could also be an important formation mechanism for short - period bs binaries and triples containing bss .",
    "we have not ruled out mass transfer or kozai - induced mergers in triples ( primordial or otherwise ) @xcite , or even various combinations of different mechanisms , as contributing formation channels to the bs binary population in ngc 188 .",
    "for instance , a 1 + 3 exchange interaction could stimulate a merger indirectly if the resulting angle of inclination between the inner and outer orbits of the triple exceeds @xmath186 , ultimately allowing the triple to evolve via the kozai mechanism so that the eccentricity of the inner binary increases while its period remains roughly constant @xcite .",
    "there is evidence to suggest that mass transfer via roche lobe over flow could play a role in the formation of at least some bss .",
    "it is difficult to account for the near zero eccentricities of some of the long - period bs binaries without at least one episode of mass transfer having occurred .",
    "this is because none of the normal ms - ms binaries with similar periods have such small eccentricities @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it may not be unreasonable to expect that some collision products left in binaries undergo mass transfer since they are expected to expand adiabatically post - collision , and will sooner or later evolve to ascend the giant branch . as a result of conservation of energy and angular momentum , the mass transfer process will usually act to increase the orbital periods of these binaries provided it is conservative @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the cut - off period for roche lobe overflow is @xmath147 days for low - mass stars @xcite , which is in rough agreement with the long - period peak in the observed period - eccentricity distribution of the bs binary population in ngc 188 .",
    "therefore , mass transfer could also be contributing to the period gap observed for the bs binaries .    according to the results of @xcite ,",
    "the number of giant - ms binaries with @xmath187 days is comparable to the number of bs binaries ( a. geller , private communication ) .",
    "it is unlikely that every giant - ms binary will form a bs from mass transfer , however , suggesting that at most a few of the long - period bs binaries in ngc 188 were formed via this mechanism .",
    "finally , if the outer companion of a triple system evolves to over - fill its roche lobe it could transfer mass to both of the components of the close inner binary .",
    "this mechanism could therefore also produce two bss in a close binary , although it predicts the presence of an orbiting triple companion . for these reasons , a better understanding of triple evolution , as well as binary evolution in binaries containing merger products ,",
    "is needed .",
    "the dissipational effects of tides tend to convert stars bulk translational kinetic energies into internal or thermal energy within the stars , leading to an increase in the total gravitational binding energy of the stellar configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by increasing the terms u@xmath188 in equation  [ eqn : energy - conserv ]",
    ", the initial orbital energies of any binaries going into an encounter can increase accordingly in order to conserve energy .",
    "a higher orbital energy corresponds to a larger semi - major axis and hence cross section for collision .",
    "this suggests that the derived encounter time - scales can be taken as upper limits in the limit that tidal dissipation is negligible .",
    "we expect tides to be particularly effective during encounters for which the total energy is very negative as a result of one or more very hard binaries being involved .",
    "we have argued in section  [ general ] that the average stellar mass is expected to be comparable to ( but slightly less than ) the mass of the msto in old ocs and low - mass gcs .",
    "we have also argued that most encounters will involve stars having masses slightly larger than the average stellar mass .",
    "we might therefore expect to find that a high proportion of merger products have masses that exceed that of the msto in very dynamically - evolved clusters that have lost a large fraction of their low - mass stars .",
    "consequently , a larger number of merger products could appear sufficiently bright to end up in the bs region of the cluster cmd in these clusters than in their less dynamically - evolved counterparts .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite and @xcite who found that the number of bss in the cores of gcs scales sub - linearly with the core mass . in particular , since the cluster relaxation time increases with increasing cluster mass , it is the lowest mass gcs that should have lost the largest fraction of their low - mass stars .",
    "therefore , if a larger fraction of merger products do indeed end up more massive than the msto in these clusters , this could be a contributing factor to the observed sub - linear dependence on core mass .",
    "it is also interesting to note that , since bss are among the most massive cluster members and many are thought to have a binary companion , bss should be preferentially retained in clusters as they evolve dynamically compared to low - mass ms stars .",
    "this could also contribute to the observed sub - linear dependence on core mass .",
    "the exchange or conversion of energies that occurs during an encounter takes place over a finite period of time , so it is important to specify whether or not the system has fully relaxed post - encounter when discussing the remaining stellar configuration . for one thing , @xcite showed that , although collision products may be in hydrodynamic equilibrium , they are not in thermal equilibrium upon formation and so contract on a thermal time - scale .",
    "simulations also suggest that most merger products should be rapid rotators @xcite .",
    "however , at least in the case of blue stragglers , this is rarely supported by the observations .",
    "some mechanism for angular momentum loss must therefore be operating either during or after the merger takes place in order to spin down the remnant .",
    "the time - scale considered must also be sufficiently short that subsequent dynamical interactions are unlikely to have occurred since these could affect the total energy and momentum of the system .    with this last point in mind",
    ", n - body simulations considering bs formation have shown that after they are formed , bss are often exchanged into other multiple star systems @xcite .",
    "this suggests that for multiple star systems containing more than one bs , the bss could have first been formed separately or in parallel , and then exchanged into their presently observed configuration . for the case of s1082",
    ", this would require at least 3 separate dynamical interactions .",
    "given that the derived times between encounters are relatively long and the fact that the most likely formation scenario is usually that for which the number of encounters is minimized , the current state of m67 suggests that the probability of s1082 having formed from a scenario involving 3 encounters is low .",
    "conversely , the derived encounter time - scales in ngc 188 are sufficiently short that many of the bs binaries could have experienced a subsequent dynamical interaction after their formation .",
    "bss tend to be more massive than normal ms stars , contributing to an increase in their gravitationally - focussed cross section for collision .",
    "this suggests that the encounter time - scale for multiple star systems containing bss is slightly shorter than for otherwise identical systems composed only of normal ms stars .",
    "this contributes to a slight increase in the probability that a bs will experience an exchange encounter after it is formed .",
    "interestingly , it could also contribute to an increase in the probability that a close binary containing two bss will form during an encounter between two different multiple star systems each containing their own bss ( @xcite ; r. mathieu , private communication ) .",
    "this is because it is the heaviest stars that will experience the strongest gravitational focussing and are therefore the most likely to experience a close encounter , end up in a closely bound configuration , or even merge .",
    "most exchange interactions will involve wide binaries for which the cross section for collision is large .",
    "since wide binaries are typically relatively soft and the hardest binary involved in the interaction will usually determine the orbital energy of the left - over bs binary , most exchange interactions will leave the periods of bs binaries relatively unaffected .",
    "this need not be the case , of course , provided one or more stars are ejected from the system with a very high escape velocity . with these last points in mind , we have assumed throughout our analysis that all binaries and triples are dynamically hard .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since the hard - soft boundary corresponds to a period of @xmath189 days in both m67 and ngc 188 , for which the cross section for collision is sufficiently large that we do not expect such binaries to survive for very long .",
    "nonetheless , considerations such as these must be properly taken into account when isolating a preferred formation scenario and predicting the final distribution of energies .",
    "we have presented an analytic technique to constrain the dynamical origins of multiple star systems containing one or more bss .",
    "our results suggest that , in old open clusters , most dynamical interactions resulting in mergers involve triple stars .",
    "if most triples are formed dynamically , this could suggest that many stellar mergers are the culmination of a hierarchical build - up of dynamical interactions .",
    "consequently , this mechanism for bs formation should be properly included in future n - body simulations of cluster evolution",
    ". a better understanding of the interplay between the cluster dynamics and the internal evolution of triple systems is needed in order to better understand the expected period distribution of bs binaries formed from triples .",
    "simulations will therefore need to track both the formation and destruction of triples as well as their internal evolution via kozai cycles , stellar and binary evolution , etc . on the observational front ,",
    "our results highlight the need for a more detailed knowledge of binary and especially triple populations in clusters .",
    "the gravitationally - focused cross sections for 1 + 1 , 1 + 2 , 2 + 2 , 1 + 3 , 2 + 3 and 3 + 3 collisions can be found using equation 6 from @xcite . neglecting the first term and assuming that binary and triple stars are on average twice and three times as massive as single stars , respectively , this gives for the various collisional cross sections : @xmath190 @xmath191 @xmath192 @xmath193 @xmath194 @xmath195 values for the pericenters assumed for the various types of encounters are shown in table  [ table : peri ] , where @xmath196 is the average stellar radius , @xmath197 is the average binary semi - major axis and @xmath198 is the average semi - major axis of the outer orbits of triples .",

    "<S> we present a technique to identify the most probable dynamical formation scenario for an observed binary or triple system containing one or more merger products or , alternatively , to rule out the possibility of a dynamical origin . </S>",
    "<S> our method relies on an analytic prescription for energy conservation during stellar encounters . with this , observations of the multiple star system containing the merger product(s ) can be used to work backwards in order to constrain the initial orbital energies of any single , binary or triple systems that went into the encounter . </S>",
    "<S> the initial semi - major axes of the orbits provide an estimate for the collisional cross section and therefore the time - scale for the encounter to occur in its host cluster .    </S>",
    "<S> we have applied our analytic prescription to observed binary and triple systems containing blue stragglers , in particular the triple system s1082 in m67 and the period distribution of the blue straggler binaries in ngc 188 . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown that both s1082 and most of the blue straggler binaries in ngc 188 could have a dynamical origin , and that encounters involving triples could be a significant contributor to bs populations in old open clusters . in general , our results suggest that encounters involving triples could make up a significant fraction of those dynamical interactions that result in stellar mergers , in particular encounters that produce multiple star systems containing one or more blue stragglers .    </S>",
