    "<S> the hypercp collaboration has presented the branching ratio of @xmath0 to be @xmath1 and suggested a new boson @xmath2 with a mass of @xmath3 mev to induce the flavor changing transition of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that to explain the data , the new particle can not be a scalar but pseudoscalar based on the direct constraints from @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we determine that the decay width of the pseudoscalar should be in the range of @xmath7 mev with the lifetime of @xmath8 sec .    according to the report of the hypercp collaboration @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the observation of three events for the decay @xmath9 reveals the possibilities of new physics , as the branching ratio br(@xmath10 is claimed to be larger than the prediction within the standard model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has found an unexpectedly narrow dimuon distribution , which can not be explained by the form factors used to deform the phase space due to their mildly momentum dependences @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the plausible explanation can be the threshold effect which is induced as @xmath11 is approaching to the pole of some unknown intermediate boson , suggesting a two - body @xmath12 decay shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig]a , with the @xmath2 mass being @xmath13 @xcite and the branching ratio @xcite @xmath14 if the effect is true , the flavor - changing neutral current ( fcnc ) of the @xmath15 transition is discovered at tree level . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , the most important task is to check the reality of the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> note that the observed events are only three and the physical properties of this unknown particle remain ambiguous . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the investigations can proceed via the decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 since they share the same effective four - fermion interaction at quark level as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig ] . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will explore the constraints on the new particle suggested by the hypercp collaboration by relating the three decay modes .    </S>",

[ fig ] by including all possible scalar - type currents , given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the decay width , @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) denotes the @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) spinor and @xmath26 are the combined coupling constants with @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 , representing scalar and pseudoscalar currents , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we stress the necessity of the decay width @xmath21 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hnp ] ) for the threshold enhancement around the pole near @xmath31 . in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hnp ] ) , there are four kinds of couplings through @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 currents . </S>",
    "<S> note that the latter two are parity - odd terms with the physical states being the mixtures of scalar and pseudoscalar @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the last one could also violate cp symmetry through the longitudinal muon polarization in @xmath36 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , we shall not consider cp violation in the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> we now apply @xmath37 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ hnp ] ) to the decay of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude is found to be @xmath39 to evaluate the amplitude , we parametrize @xmath40 where the form factors are given by @xcite @xmath41 with @xcite @xmath42 it is noted that the momentum dependences are expressed as the double - pole expansions .    to test possibilities of new physics from @xmath43 , we study the decays of @xmath5 and @xmath6 due to @xmath44 in eq . </S>",

    "<S> the amplitudes of @xmath45 and @xmath46 are given by @xmath47\\bar u\\gamma_jv\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] respectively . </S>",
    "<S> here , we have defined @xmath48 and @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that there are no contributions from @xmath50 and @xmath51 due to the parity conservation in strong interaction . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , @xmath5 can only be used to constrain the couplings of @xmath52 , while @xmath6 to those of @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> the matrix elements in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ k3 ] ) by means of equation of motion are found to be @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 mev @xcite .    to proceed , we first concentrate on @xmath52 couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental measurement for the decay of @xmath57 is @xcite @xmath58 it has been domenstrated that the dominate contribution for the decay is from the one - photon exchange in the standard model , which can be referred , such as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the partial branching ratio of the three - body decay is proportional to @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the squared amplitude and @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the mass ( lifetime ) of the mother particle . for the @xmath63 currents , from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma])-([k3 ] ) we have @xmath64 and @xmath65 . after integrating the phase space , we find that @xmath66 for the @xmath63 currents . </S>",
    "<S> note that the estimation of the ratio in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ brks ] ) is independent of the property of the new particle . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath67 is in the range of @xmath68 , in any case , @xmath69 should be of @xmath70 if the interaction is @xmath63 , which is clearly out of the limitation in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kpimumu ] ) . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the tree level flavor - changing @xmath18 transition resulting from the new physics of @xmath63 currents is unambiguously ruled out based on the data of @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we now turn to the new physics from @xmath33 and @xmath35 currents . </S>",
    "<S> currently , the experimental measurement on @xmath6 is @xcite @xmath71 which is almost saturated by the absorptive ( imaginary ) part , dominated by the measured mode of @xmath72 with @xmath73 @xcite , i.e. , @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is still a possibility of the cancellation among the short - distance amplitude and the real part of the long - distance part @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , it is believed that the new physics contribution to the decay branching ratio can not excess of @xmath75 @xcite . to be conservative </S>",
    "<S> , we shall use @xmath76 as our working assumption to constrain the new physics .    beginning with a rough estimate , </S>",
    "<S> if we assume that @xmath77 mev , we find that the ratio of @xmath78 and @xmath79 is around @xmath80 ( @xmath81 ) for @xmath82 such that @xmath83 would be of order @xmath84 ( @xmath8 ) , which is not consistent with the data in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exp31 ] ) when relating it to that of eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ kla ] ) . nonetheless , if we resort the large pole effect with a small @xmath21 , there still remains a possibility to make @xmath0 in the order of @xmath85 . </S>",
    "<S> it also explains why the constraint from @xmath5 is strong enough , so that there is no room for new physics , since @xmath5 and @xmath9 are both three - body decays and the pole effect is at the same place . for @xmath86 in the range of @xmath87 with the @xmath33-type current , and the allowed coupling constants and the decay width are demonstrated in table [ table ] . while constraints on the coupling constants are mainly from different open windows of @xmath86 , the sets of @xmath21 s are as small as possible to enhance @xmath88 to match the experimental value in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ exp31 ] ) , where the error has been taken as the larger one between @xmath89 and @xmath90 . </S>",
    "<S> it is obvious that the pole effect plays the most important role to coincide with both data of @xmath36 and @xmath91 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the coupling constant @xmath92 is in the order of @xmath84 while the decay width @xmath21 is in the range of @xmath93 , translated as the lifetime of @xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> inasmuch as it is also possible from the @xmath35 current though it would induce cp violation @xcite , the window as well is opened as the same as that of the @xmath33 current , and we obtain that @xmath95 around @xmath84 with @xmath21 in @xmath96 , which is one order of magnitude smaller than that of the @xmath33 current .    . </S>",
    "<S> _ the coupling constant and decay width of @xmath2 for @xmath33 and @xmath35 currents . _ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     among theoretical models , the proposed pseudoscalar particle @xmath2 is not likely the axion for its mass being much heavier than the allowed values @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it can not be a leptoquark either since it could not lead to the pole effect . </S>",
    "<S> however , the sgoldstino of the supersymmetric model is still allowed as the range of the mass is consistent with the experimental one @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , more efforts of both theory and experiment are needed .    in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have found that as an intermediate boson to the decay of @xmath97 , @xmath2 can be induced from the @xmath33 or @xmath35-type current , which is testified with @xmath36 , whereas @xmath34 and @xmath98-type currents have been proven to be impossible via the decay of @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the analysis suggests that in the window of @xmath99 , while @xmath100 with @xmath101 , the decay width and lifetime are @xmath102 mev and @xmath103 sec , respectively , with the coupling constants @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we remark that our analysis can be generalized to vector and axial - vector currents .    </S>",
    "<S> note added : before we presented the paper , there were two similar papers by he _ </S>",

    "<S> @xcite begin with the lagrangian coupled to the new particle , we consider the effective four - quark interaction at quark level , which leads to @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> the propagator in the interaction includes the decay width to avoid divergence due to the pole . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , we can give stronger constraints on the decay width . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that in the same effective four - quark interaction for @xmath105 currents , the deviation between @xmath0 and @xmath106 is only in @xmath107 with the phase space , given a ratio of @xmath108 , such that we completely rule out any possibilities from a scalar coupling of the @xmath15 transition , which is consistent with ref . </S>",
