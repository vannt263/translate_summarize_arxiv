    "the issues of metal - insulator transitions ( mit )  @xcite and the high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductivity  @xcite have opened extensive studies on related subjects from both theoretical and experimental aspects  @xcite . in spite of a long history of studies  @xcite ,",
    "their appropriate and satisfactory theoretical descriptions remain controversial .",
    "this paper aims at giving a unified view of the filling - control mit in the 2d hubbard model by means of the operator projection method ( opm )  @xcite and discussing _ electron differentiation in the momentum space _ obtained by the opm which also occurs in underdoped high-@xmath0 cuprates .",
    "the opm is a recently developed non - perturbative analytic method based on the projeciton technique in an operator space  @xcite and systematically improves the hartree - fock theory and the hubbard  @xcite and two - pole approximations  @xcite as well as the perturbation and spin fluctuation theories  @xcite .",
    "pictures of early theories on the mit are classified into three types : ( i ) the hubbard approximations described an mit as the splitting of two hubbard bands due to the strong local coulomb repulsion @xmath1 compared with the bare bandwidth @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "however , they and improved theories  @xcite violate the luttinger sum rule in paramagnetic metals .",
    "( ii ) brinkman and rice predicted that at half filling , an mit occurs at @xmath3 due to the disappearance of quasiparticles accompanied by the mass divergence  @xcite .",
    "however , it ignores spin correlations and incoherent hubbard bands .",
    "( iii ) the slater gives a view that a folding of the brillouin zone accompanied by the antiferromagnetic ( af ) phase transition yields an energy gap in the single - particle excitations .",
    "self - consistent renormalization theory modified the hartree - fock theory and the rpa  @xcite .",
    "however , they do not give mott - insulating features above the neel temperature .",
    "further intensive studies on the mit have been promoted to explain peculiar features observed in high-@xmath0 cuprates  @xcite . their proper understanding and description remains still challenging due to difficulties in correctly describing strong correlations near the mit .",
    "it is crucial to build a unified theory of the three aspects of the mit , in order to explain global phase diagrams of compounds that undergo an mit  @xcite , to clarify the mechanism of the high-@xmath0 superconductivity and to describe the mit in the hubbard model .",
    "gaussian fluctuations around the slave - boson mean - field theory  @xcite as well as the dynamical mean - field solution ( dmft )  @xcite incorporates the hubbard bands but not spin correlations to the brinkman - rice picture .",
    "the dmft predicts a lowest - energy resonance inside the hubbard gap at half filling below @xmath3 .",
    "however , it ignores the momentum dependence of the self - energy part in finite dimensions .",
    "some independent momentum patches can be inctroduced into this local self - energy part  @xcite . then , for the 2d half - filled hubbard model at weak couplings ,",
    "a mott insulator with sharp peaks at the gap edges is reproduced , though solving a cluster problem yields severe limitations here .",
    "no theories self - consistently modifying the rpa  @xcite predict mott - insulating features  @xcite , without abandoning the self - consistency between the green s function and the self - energy part  @xcite .",
    "quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations have revealed the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the 2d hubbard model : the charge compressibility diverges towards half filling  @xcite . near half filling , nearly separated hubbard bands develop , the luttinger sum rule is violated at the temperature @xmath4 and a sharp peak of the local density of states develops near the fermi level with decreasing @xmath5 , reflecting a suppressed fermi temperature @xmath6 .  @xcite . at @xmath7 , extra two bands appear in addition to the hubbard bands  @xcite .",
    "a dispersion around the @xmath8 and @xmath9 momenta is strongly weak  @xcite",
    ". strong momentum dependence of quasiparticle excitations is a crucial feature beyond the early three pictures of the mit .",
    "the opm  @xcite offers a theoretical framework unifying the early three pictures and reproducing key features beyond them  @xcite , the momentum - dependent electron differentiation in the low - energy hierarchy .",
    "they are discussed in   [ sec : half - filling ] and [ sec : doped ] .",
    "the opm is formulated in   [ sec : formulation ] . based on equations of motion",
    ", it gives a unique continued - fraction or dyson - equation expression of a correlation function .",
    "it may systematically extract the lower - energy properties by projecting out higher - energy degrees of freedom in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "for the self - energy part , we can build its dyson equation beyond the perturbation and one - loop theories .",
    "the higher - order dynamics was considered within a two - site level in a local picture  @xcite , though growing spin correlations were ignored even near the continuous af phase transition .",
    "the opm solves this difficulty  @xcite .    in   [ sec :",

    "the similarity of the dispersions between our results and high-@xmath0 cuprates indicates that to capture essential features of the superconductivity , it is crucial to describe the correlation effects with strongly momentum - dependent renormalization shared by the hubbard model and the cuprates near the mit .",

    "<S> metals approaching the mott insulator generate a new hierarchy in the electronic structure accompanied by a momentum dependent electron differentiation , beyond the mott - hubbard , brinkman - rice and slater pictures of the mott transition . </S>",
    "<S> to consider such nonlinear phenomenon , we develop an analytic nonperturbative theory based on operator projections combined with a self - consistent treatment of the low - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> this reproduces the formation of the hubbard bands , mott gap , spin fluctuations , mass divergence , diverging charge compressibility , and strongly renormalized flat and damped dispersion similar to angle - resolved photoemission data in high-@xmath0 cuprates . </S>",
    "<S> main structures in electronic spectra show a remarkable similarity to numerical results .    </S>",
    "<S> _ keywords _ : metal - insulator transition ; projection operator ; high-@xmath0 cuprate superconductors </S>"
