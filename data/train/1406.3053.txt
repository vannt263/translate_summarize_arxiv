    "although theory has been used to support research in new rechargeable battery materials,@xcite whether theory can be used to design new materials without experimental input will largely depend on the ability of electronic structure methods to describe new and existing materials with accuracies compatible with experimental needs.@xcite thus , in order to respond to initiatives such as the materials genome,@xcite the predictive power of theory must be characterized .    in energy storage research",
    ", a significant challenge is to accurately predict the thermodynamic phase stability and ionic / electronic conductivity of cathode materials.@xcite this is because theoretical calculations are mainly based on density functional theory ( dft ) within the local density ( lda ) and generalized gradient ( gga ) approximations .",
    "while these approximations are accurate enough to study the thermodynamic and conductive properties of many materials , they are unreliable in others , e.g. , transition metal - oxides . approximations such as lda and gga do not account properly for exchange and correlation effects in transition metal - oxides , leading to exchange - correlation errors such as the self - interaction error.@xcite in practice a semi - empirical approach is adopted in an attempt to minimize these errors , but the use of experimental data for the calibration and validation inevitably reduces the predictive power of the method .",
    "the doping of cathode materials is an example where it is crucial to accurately predict thermodynamic and conductive properties and where a predictive theory is highly desired .",
    "a case that exemplifies the problem is the doping of licoo@xmath0 with cations such as mg .",
    "the effect of mg - doping on the electronic conductivity and long - term capacity retention of layered licoo@xmath0-based batteries have been extensively studied.@xcite carewska _ _ et al.__@xcite and tukamoto and west@xcite showed that doping licoo@xmath0 with mg increases its electronic conductivity .",
    "this higher conductivity was rationalized by considering the generation of electronic holes due to the formation of a mixed + 3/+4 valence state in co.@xcite later studies@xcite supported this model and suggested that the transfer of an electron from co ion to o 2__p _ _ hole is also involved in raising the conductivity . the formation of oxygen vacancies in mg - doped licoo@xmath1 has also been proposed to contribute to the higher conductivity.@xcite    in addition to the increased conductivity , a significant capacity retention for mg - doped linicoo@xmath0-based batteries was independently reported by chang _",
    "et al._,@xcite cho@xcite and kweon _ _ et al.__@xcite for example , cho found 92% capacity retention for lini@xmath2co@xmath3mg@xmath4o@xmath0 after 94 cycles at 1 c rate vs. 70% for lini@xmath2co@xmath5o@xmath0.@xcite mg - doping also improves the thermal stability of li - ion batteries .",
    "similar improved capacity and thermal properties were later reported by other authors for licoo@xmath0-based batteries .",
    "@xcite however , doping licoo@xmath1 and linio@xmath1 based cathode materials with mg cations has the drawback of decreasing the capacity@xcite because mg reduces the concentration of the active ni@xmath6 or co@xmath6 ion sites.@xcite    several explanations for the stability of mg - doped li - ion batteries have been proposed .",
    "cho proposed that a lower cation mixing in lini@xmath2co@xmath7mg@xmath8o@xmath0 than in lini@xmath2co@xmath5o@xmath0 battery leads to the improved stability.@xcite a large degree of cation mixing , where li ions partially occupy the ni ( co ) sites and vise versa , results in lower capacity and affects the structural stability of the layered material.@xcite    the higher stability has also been rationalized as a pillaring effect , where mg located in the oxide layers or inter - layer spaces prevents the structural collapse and crystallinity loss during charge / discharge . however , it is still unclear if mg is located in oxide layers or inter - layers spaces , i.e. whether mg is on li or transition metal sites .",
    "it has been proposed that mg is initially on the transition metal sites , but it migrates to the inter - layer spaces after initial cycling.@xcite xiang _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed a similar model based on a detailed analysis of measured change in the volume of lini@xmath9co@xmath10mg@xmath8o@xmath0 as function of _ x _ and possible substitutions and charge balance mechanisms for mg .",
    "they suggested that the stronger mg - o bond ( vs. li - o ) enhances the stability of lini@xmath11co@xmath12o@xmath0-based batteries .",
    "on the other hand , chang _ _ et al.__@xcite found that mg cations are mainly on ni sites .",
    "they argued that mg stabilizes the nio@xmath0 slab , preventing thermal and cycling decomposition.@xcite tatsumi _ _ et al.__@xcite also found mg cations to preferentially replace ni sites initially , but to diffuse out of the active material during cycling .",
    "more recently , tavakoli _ _ et al.__@xcite proposed that a short - range ordering of ni cations around mg results on lini@xmath13co@xmath14al@xmath15mg@xmath16o@xmath0 batteries 34.2 @xmath17 9.3 mev more thermodynamically stable than undoped lini@xmath18co@xmath19al@xmath15o@xmath0 .",
    "such stabilization can provide stronger bonding and prevent the formation of nio - like phase during charge / discharge.@xcite    despite the significant experimental efforts outlined above , it is still unclear how mg - doping improves the stability of licoo@xmath0 and linio@xmath0 based batteries . in part , this is because no theoretical work has been performed to evaluate the thermodynamic profile of mg in these batteries .",
    "calculations have mainly focused on the electronic properties,@xcite lattice stability@xcite and li - intercalation voltage@xcite of mg - doped licoo@xmath0 .",
    "calculations have also been employed to study the site preference of mg in linio@xmath0 by combining theory , x - ray absorption near - edge structure and electron energy - loss near - edge structure measurements.@xcite    the relative lack of calculations for the thermodynamics of mg in these cathode materials comes because such calculations of impurities in transition metal - oxides are rather difficult within the framework of dft .",
    "this is mainly because of dft errors in transition metal - oxides .",
    "these errors can be partially removed by introducing an on - site hubbard model correction ( dft+u).@xcite this method has been successfully used to study li - ion battery cathodes,@xcite and other transition metal - oxides.@xcite it is also the standard approach adopted by the `` materials project''@xcite for high throughput computation of materials , including metal - oxides . however , physically , the parameter u should depend on the chemical environment of the atomic site where it is applied , while in conventional dft+u calculations a universal value of u is used . as a result dft+u often fails to correctly predict the relative energy between systems with a mixture of localized and delocalized electronic states.@xcite this is particularly problematic if one uses dft+u to study dopants that can induce localized or delocalized states in transition metal - oxides .",
    "mg is a divalent dopant and its substitution onto a co or li site can induce a localized or delocalized state in licoo@xmath0 .",
    "therefore , to elucidate how mg improves the performance of the licoo@xmath0 cathode material using dft / dft+u methods , a first step is to study how sensitive the calculated properties of mg - doped licoo@xmath0 are to different choices of the parameter u. to this end , we studied the effect of u on the energetic , geometric and electronic properties of mg when it is located on co and li sites as well as when it forms complexes with li vacancies or interstitial sites in licoo@xmath0 .",
    "the remainder of this article is organized as follows .",
    "we first discuss the doping mechanisms that were examined , the computational methods employed and how the chemical potentials were established .",
    "we then present our results .",
    "we start by analyzing the effect of the u parameter on the range of chemical potentials , emphasizing the effect on the phase boundaries of licoo@xmath0 .",
    "subsequently , we discuss the effect of u on the formation energy , geometry and electronic structure of mg - doped licoo@xmath0 .",
    "we conclude with a summary and our conclusions .",
    "mg is formally a divalent dopant , mg@xmath20 , and its substitution onto a co or li site in licoo@xmath1 is an aliovalent substitution that requires a mechanism for charge compensation . one possible mechanism is the formation of new electronic species . in this mechanism , the substitution of mg@xmath20 onto a co@xmath6 site leads to the extrinsic mg@xmath21 defect and a concomitant increase in the oxidation state of a co site from 3 + to 4 + , which introduces an impurity hole in the system .",
    "this mechanism was originally proposed to rationalize the high conductivity of mg - doped licoo@xmath1.@xcite on the other hand , the substitution of mg@xmath20 onto a li@xmath22 site is balanced by the formation of a co site with oxidation state + 2 , i.e an impurity electron is introduced in the system .",
    "other mechanisms for charge compensation can involve the formation of vacancy , interstitial and anti - site defects , and defect complexes.@xcite in licoo@xmath1 , many intrinsic defects can combine with substitutional mg and form a complex for charge compensation .",
    "mg@xmath21 can form a complex with electron donor defects such as v@xmath23 , co@xmath24 , li@xmath25 and co@xmath26 , while mg@xmath27 with electron acceptor defects such as v@xmath27 , v@xmath28 , li@xmath29 .",
    "recent calculations@xcite have shown that , of these ionic defects , the dominant one under typical synthesis conditions is the anti - site co@xmath26 defect .",
    "the other intrinsic defects have high formation energies and are expected to have a low concentration.@xcite based on such reports , we considered in our initial calculations the mg@xmath21-co@xmath26 complex as a charge compensation mechanism .",
    "however , the formation energy of this complex is over 1.5 ev when the system is under charge neutrality and , therefore , it was not further considered.@xcite instead , we considered the neutral complexes mg@xmath21-li@xmath25 and mg@xmath27-v@xmath27 as they can be relevant to the electrochemistry of mg - doped licoo@xmath0 . additionally , we studied the charge compensation by the dual substitution of mg on co and li sites , i.e. the mg@xmath21-mg@xmath27 complex .",
    "to quantify the incorporation of mg in licoo@xmath0 , we evaluated the formation energy of the possible extrinsic defects and defect complexes as :    @xmath30 - e_{tot } \\left[licoo_2\\right ]   - \\sum_{i}n_i\\mu_i \\label{eq : six}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where _ x _ is a neutral extrinsic or intrinsic defect ( or defect complex ) .",

    "gaussian broadening with an energy width of 0.1 ev was used for the brillouin zone integration .",
    "these choices are sufficient to converge the bulk energies to better than 2 mev per primitive cell , which is substantially smaller than the variation due to the use of different functionals .        licoo@xmath1 supercells with a defect _ x _ were calculated employing 4@xmath414@xmath412 supercells built from the primitive rhombohedral unit cell and 2@xmath412@xmath413 monkhorst - pack k - point meshes .",

    "instead , self - consistently determined@xcite u have been used.@xcite for co , the self - consistent u values range from 4.91 to 5.62 ev.@xcite as our results show , u values in this range lead to deep levels in mg - doped licoo@xmath0 , which is inconsistent with the observed high electronic conductivity of this material .",
    "in the present work , we have studied the doping of licoo@xmath0 with mg employing the gga and gga+u methods . in particular",
    ", we explored the effect of the u parameter on the energetic , geometric and electronic properties of mg in licoo@xmath0 .",
    "our results show that these properties for mg located on a co or a li site in licoo@xmath0 depend on the chosen u value .",
    "a similar dependence on u was also found in the properties of li vacancy and li interstitial defects in licoo@xmath0 .",
    "the similarity arises because the substitutional mg and the li defects lead to impurity states in licoo@xmath0 with changes on the valency of co in licoo@xmath0 .",
    "the strong dependence on u of the energetic , geometric and electronic properties is a direct consequence of the valency change of co. increasing the u value eventually changes the impurity states from shallow to deep levels .",
    "conversely , if mg on co or li sites forms complexes and no impurity states are introduced in licoo@xmath0 , the properties of such defect complexes are insensitive to the u value .",
    "these results indicate that gga / gga+u methods may be used to study isovalent substitution in licoo@xmath0 . for aliovalent substitution , such as mg on a co or a li site ,",
    "the usefulness of gga / gga+u methods is limited because experimental or theoretical data from accurate _ ab initio _",
    "methods@xcite are needed to validate the u dependent results . moreover , even if such data were available , one is left with the problem of a single u value not giving a reasonable overall description of the properties of licoo@xmath0 . for example , u values close to 3@xcite and 5@xcite ev result in band gaps similar to experimental values , u = 3.3@xcite ev correctly describes some of the major features in the phase diagram of licoo@xmath0 while u values close to 5@xcite ev are needed to reproduce the measured average li - intercalation potential .",
    "our present results show that u values of 3.3 ev and lower can describe the high electronic conductivity of mg - doped licoo@xmath0 but u as low as 1.5 ev are needed to describe the solubility of mg in licoo@xmath0 .",
    "finally , even if a perfect u value could be found , it would not improve the oxygen molecule formation energy or the thermodynamic properties of materials without d electrons .",
    "empirical corrections would still be required .",
