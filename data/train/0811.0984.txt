    "models involving an extra space - like compact dimension motivated by unification ideas have a long history in physics @xcite .",
    "more recently , the proposal of a non - factorizable metric in 5 dimensions , representing a slice of anti - de sitter ads@xmath6 bulk spacetime with two 3-branes at its boundaries , led to a new possible solution to the hierarchy problem of the standard model ( sm ) @xcite .    in the original proposal all sm fields",
    "were confined in one of the branes and only gravity would propagate in the bulk . allowing all fields of the sm ( with the exception of the higgs field ) to propagate in the bulk",
    "opens up the exciting possibility of explaining the fermion mass hierarchy with @xmath7 parameters , at the same time solving the problem of the existence of higher - dimensional operators which could induce proton decay and flavour violation @xcite .",
    "these models have a very rich phenomenology , with the existence of kaluza - klein ( kk ) excitations of the sm particles .",
    "however , contributions from these new kk modes can violate electroweak precision constraints described by the s and t parameters @xcite and constraints from @xmath8 .",
    "this situation can be ameliorated by the introduction of a custodial gauge symmetry in the bulk @xcite .",
    "this custodial symmetry has important phenomenological consequences : it introduces isospin partners of the right handed fermionic fields , sometimes called custodians @xcite .",
    "the custodians in some models can have masses not much larger than @xmath9 gev .",
    "in particular , these custodians can be produced at the lhc with spectacular signatures , such as multi - w events @xcite .",
    "finding custodians at the lhc using same - sign dileptons final states coming from multi - w events was recently studied in @xcite .    in this letter",
    "we describe another signature of the @xmath0 custodian , a charge @xmath10 isospin partner of the right - handed top quark , which is rarer but cleaner than the multi - w signature .",
    "there are many different models which predict the existence of light custodians . below",
    "we exemplify our strategy with a specific minimal model , where the custodians may not be particularly light due to their contributions to the @xmath11 vertex",
    ". however , more complex models can be built in which this vertex can be protected @xcite .",
    "we will follow the notation of @xcite and adopt the 5d metric @xmath12\\ ] ] where @xmath13 is the compact 5th dimension bounded by @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the locations of the planck and tev branes , respectively . for definiteness we will use @xmath17 .",
    "the model with custodial symmetry has a bulk @xmath18 and the 3rd generation quarks are @xcite : @xmath19    here we will be interested in the @xmath0 , the @xmath20 partner of the right - handed top quark . using the notation of @xcite ,",
    "the 5d @xmath21 is a @xmath22 fermion in order to have a zero mode , which will be identified with the 4d right - handed top quark .",
    "requiring that the @xmath18 is broken by boundary conditions only at the planck brane determines @xmath0 to be a @xmath23 fermion .",
    "the kk decomposition of a 5d fermion is : @xmath24,\\ ] ] where the parameter @xmath25 , related to the fermion bulk mass , determines the profile of the fermion in the extra dimension .",
    "for instance , the profile for the zero - mode fermion is given by : @xmath26    the profile for a @xmath23 fermion is given by @xcite @xmath27 \\left(\\frac{z}{z_h}\\right)^{5/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a normalization factor , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are bessel functions of order @xmath32 .",
    "the mass of a given fermion mode @xmath33 and the constant @xmath34 are obtained by solving the equations : @xmath35 where the upper ( lower ) signs are for @xmath36 @xmath37 .",
    "since the right - handed top must be localized near the tev brane and @xmath20 is preserved in the bulk , we will use @xmath38 in the following . with these assignments",
    "we find @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "in this letter we will be interested in the pair production of @xmath0 .",
    "the dominant processes involves qcd interactions . due to the fact that the gluon zero - mode profile is flat in the extra dimension , the coupling of the color - triplet @xmath0 to gluons is exactly the standard model one .",
    "however , one should in principle also compute the couplings to @xmath41 , the first gluonic kk excitation .",
    "its mass is found to be @xmath42 and the coupling is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the first gluonic kk excitation profile ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the integrand is peaked towards the tev brane and we find a large coupling , @xmath45 .",
    "this large coupling implies that the kk gluon is a broad resonance , with a width of the order of half of its mass .",
    "for light quarks , however , we find that the coupling @xmath46 since they are peaked at the planck brane .    the @xmath0 main decay modes ( @xmath47 ) can be studied from the yukawa interactions of fermions with the bi - doublet higgs localized in the tev brane : @xmath48.\\ ] ] after making the usual higgs field re - scaling and identifying the 4d top quark yukawa coupling @xmath49",
    ", we find that there is a @xmath50 resulting in the non - diagonal mass matrix : @xmath51 this is very important since it induces a mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath52 .",
    "it is through this mixing that the decay modes @xmath53 are generated with a strength ( the @xmath54 decay could also occur via a mixing @xmath55 but it is suppressed by the small parameter @xmath56 ) : @xmath57 on the other hand , the decay @xmath58 is generated with a strength set by the top yukawa coupling @xmath59 .",
    "it turns out that the dominant decay mode is @xmath60 , which generates multi - w events in the final state and was analyzed in @xcite . here",
    "we will concentrate on the study of the rarer , but cleaner decay @xmath61 .",
    "we now have all the ingredients necessary to implement and study the @xmath0 pair production at the lhc in this particular decay channel : @xmath62 .",
    "we implemented the new particles ( @xmath0 and @xmath41 ) and couplings in madgraph / madevent @xcite .",
    "fixing @xmath63 , the only free parameter left can be taken as the mass @xmath64 of @xmath0 .",
    "we will study the case for @xmath65 and @xmath66 gev .",
    "we use the total widths calculated in @xcite .",
    "one should be careful that these mass values do not lead to violations in the well measured @xmath11 couplings .",
    "in fact , one generally finds that the contribution arising from fermionic kk partners is given by @xcite @xmath67 where typically the mixing angle is given by @xmath68 which would naivelly require @xmath69 tev .",
    "however , in more realistic models for the custodians their masses could be as low as @xmath9 gev @xcite .",
    "we included the kk gluon contribution and found it to be small due to the fact that it only arises in @xmath70channel diagrams initiated by light quarks , which is suppressed at the lhc and also because the kk gluon is a very broad resonance .",
    "the dominant contribution arises from @xmath71channel @xmath0 exchange in gluon - initiated processes .",
    "we have generated the irreducible sm background again using madgraph / madevent .    in figure",
    "[ 1 ] we show the cross section per @xmath72 gev bins as a function of the invariant mass of the @xmath3 pair .",

    "this decay is suppressed by the @xmath101 mass , which is allowed to be as low as a few hundreds gev without inducing large contributions to @xmath102 .",
    "this protection is guaranteed by the custodial symmetry that requires this particle to be in a multiplet with the right - handed top quark .",
    "we concentrated in the `` golden modes '' @xmath103 that would allow in principle a straightforward particle mass reconstruction .",
    "we calculated the differential cross section for the process @xmath104 as a function of the @xmath78 invariant mass taking into account the @xmath1 `` golden modes '' decay branching ratios and b - tagging efficiency .",

    "the required luminosities can be achieved at the lhc first years , but unfortunately for @xmath110 and @xmath66 gev much higher luminosities are needed .",
    "we also applied a harder cut @xmath111 but even with a significat reduction of the standard model background we found that the signal cross section also decreases and very high luminosities are necessary to obtain few events .",
    "however , further studies with more realistic simulations must be done , in particular including other @xmath1 decay modes such as decays into @xmath97 s , neutrinos and even jets ( which will have a much larger background ) , in order to conclude whether this is an experimental viable decay channel the study of this light custodian .",
