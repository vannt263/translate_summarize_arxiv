    "( [ prft0 ] ) in which eventual negative values of the field ( that may appear due to the discretization ) are fixed to @xmath9 , does not preserve the presence of an absorbing state .",

    "the mean time required for the system to overpass the barrier and collapse to the absorbing state grows exponentially with time , and becomes infinite in the thermodynamic limit . in this way the phase transition appears only in infinitely large systems , and the large system - size limit has to be taken first than the infinite time limit in order to permit the presence of an active phase . in dimensions larger than @xmath29 the same qualitative type of behavior is expected .",

    "this is an essential difference with rft .",
    "let us now explore how this property of the single - site potential is modified in higher dimensions .",
    "for that , we perform a numerical integration of the stochastic equation defining the model , which presents less technical difficulties than the integration of the rft @xcite .",
    "the result are presented in figure [ v1mn ] .",
    "qualitatively the potential shape changes in the same way as it does in the 0-dimensional case . above the critical point , there is either an integrable singularity ( uppermost curve ) or a repelling wall ( three other curves ) at the origin .",
    "the first case , i.e. , an integrable singularity at the origin occurs in a very tiny region of the parameter space . on the other hand , in the absorbing phase",
    "there is a collapse of the probability towards @xmath35 ( non - integrable singularity at the origin ) .",
    "therefore , the physics is very different from that of rft : when the system is in the active phase , there is either an integrable singularity at the origin of the potential or a repelling wall . in any case",
    ", the situation differs from that in rft , in which there are two locally stable attractors in the active phase : one at the origin ( the stable one ) and one at a different point ( a metastable one ) .",

    "( [ mn ] ) : in a finite reaction - diffusion system with a non - vanishing particle annihilation rate there is a non - zero probability of reaching the absorbing ( empty ) state for any finite system - size and for any set of parameter values . in systems with mn there is no accessible absorbing state in the active phase , i.e. there is no non - integrable singularity at the origin of the potential ( and consequently no collapse of the probability density to the origin ) , and therefore mn does not capture the physics of reaction - diffusion systems .",
    "that fact , does not mean that it is not possible to construct discrete lattice model in the multiplicative noise universality class .",
    "in particular , systems exhibiting an unbinding transition from a wall ( as , for example , the problem of local alignment of dna chains @xcite , and wetting transitions @xcite ) belong in this universality class . these models are usually defined in terms of a field variable @xmath41 that flows to @xmath42 in the absorbing phase , and that reach a non - vanishing stationary average value otherwise .      in this section",
    "we compare the effect of the complex noise appearing in the peliti s field theory eq .",
    "( [ pft ] ) , with the two previously studied cases to get a global picture of the different type of noises that can appear in systems with absorbing states .",
    "in order to understand what is the origin of the complex noise in processes as @xmath18 , and to clarify whether a microscopic process like that with a real density field has necessarily to be described by a complex langevin equation , we present a derivation of the peliti s field theory for the annihilation reaction : @xmath18 by employing the exact poisson representation introduced by gardiner and chatuverdi @xcite .",
    "note that for this reaction there is no active phase , and the interesting magnitudes are those describing the decay towards the absorbing state .",

    "this type of transformation leads to a function @xmath54 which is positive and can be identified as a probability distribution @xcite .",

    "a typical trajectory of the previous set of equations in the stationary state is shown in figure [ trajectory ] ; it wonders in the complex plane avoiding a region around @xmath46 . even if the stationary solution of the underlying process @xmath18 is a delta function at zero or one particles ( depending on whether the initial condition is even or odd respectively )",
    ", the stationary probability associated to eq.([complex ] ) is not a delta function , but some complicate distribution with @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",

    "the expectation value of the imaginary part is zero as expected given the relation among moments of @xmath54 and @xmath53 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the effective potential associated to the stationary distribution is a non - differentiable one ; in figure ( [ corte ] ) we show a one - dimensional cut of the stationary potential for different @xmath68 with @xmath79 as computed in a simulation of eq .",
    "( [ complex ] ) . note that contrarily to the cases of the rft and multiplicative noise equation , now the dynamics is not frozen even if the system has relaxed to the absorbing state .",

    "the stationary potential associated to eq.([nonmark ] ) can not be calculated analytically ; the numerical solution is shown in figure [ histoproyect ] .",
    "first we observe that it is non - differentiable at @xmath82 ; also we point out that @xmath68 is not absorbing in general ( except for the pathological and unphysical case @xmath83 ) , in other words : due to the presence of the non - markovian terms , proportional to @xmath84 , the system can cross from positive values to negative ones .    the role of the complex variable in eq .",
    "( [ lan ] ) is played , after @xmath69 has been integrated out , by the non - markovian terms in eq .",
    "( [ nonmark ] ) , and in both cases the absorbing state of the microscopic associated process is not described by a frozen dynamics in the langevin representation , but by a non - trivial dynamics ( complex or non - markovian ) which statistical properties reproduce those of the reaction - diffusion model .",
    "therefore , the nature of the absorbing state in this case is essentially different from those of the previously studied cases .    for the sake of completeness let us just mention briefly that a numerical study of the one - dimensional peliti s field theory in terms of a complex langevin equation has been recently published @xcite .",
    "the measured magnitudes are in very good agreement with the theoretical predictions coming from renormalization - group and other type of analysis @xcite , confirming that a complex representation captures the physics of microscopic systems as , for example , the procces @xmath18 .",
    "we have analyzed different langevin equations associated to systems with absorbing states .",
    "systems described by the reggeon field theory langevin equation exhibit a non - integrable singularity at the origin of the single - site potential , that corresponds to a true absorbing state , i.e. , there is an accumulation of probability density at the origin , while the active state is a metastable one for finite system - sizes .",
    "systems with multiplicative noise instead change the degree of the singularity at the origin as the control parameter is changed : while in the absorbing phase there is a collapse of the probability density towards the origin , in the active phase there is either an integrable singularity at the origin or it becomes repelling , in which case the the probability to be nearby the origin becomes extremely small , and there is no accessible absorbing state .",
    "that is the reason why is not possible to find reaction - diffusion systems ( in which for finite size systems there is always a finite probability of reaching the absorbing state ) in the multiplicative noise universality class .",
    "we have also analized some aspects of the annihilation process @xmath85 , which is described by a complex noise langevin equation or alternatively by a real non - markovian langevin equation .",
    "this type of langevin equation shows a behavior quite different from that of reggeon field theory and multiplicative noise ; in particular , even if the system is in the absorbing state , there is not a collapse of the probability density to a delta function , and the dynamics is non - trivial .",
    "systems with complex noise can alternatively be described by real non - markovian equations .",
    "let us consider the pair of reactions @xmath18 and @xmath86 , the first occurring with a rate @xmath87 and the second with @xmath88 .",
