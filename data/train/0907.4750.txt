    "these observations suggest that particles are accelerated around open clusters .",
    "several models have been proposed as the origin of the gamma - ray emission from young open clusters .",
    "the gamma - rays could be produced through collisions of protons accelerated at shocks in massive stellar winds in the cluster @xcite .",
    "some of the protons may penetrate the winds of the massive stars toward the stellar surfaces and produce gamma - rays through hadronic interactions in the dense parts of the winds @xcite .",

    "in addition to the stellar winds , pulsars in a cluster might be responsible for the gamma - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the gamma - rays could also be produced through the photodisintegration of highly boosted nuclei followed by daughter deexcitation @xcite .",
    "westerlund  2 is one of the clusters from which gamma - ray emission has been detected with h.e.s.s .",
    "it is ionizing the large h region rcw 49 ( ngc 3247 ) .",
    "the gamma - ray emission is extended ( @xmath1 ) , and the whole cluster is buried in it .",
    "observations in the x - ray band are crucial to find the origin of the diffuse gamma - ray emission from the cluster and the mechanism of particle acceleration . in particular , the strength of non - thermal x - ray emission can be used to discriminate between the hadronic and the leptonic origin of the gamma - rays @xcite , and estimate the time - scale of particle acceleration @xcite . in the x - ray band , although the cluster has been observed with einstein @xcite and rosat @xcite , strict constraint on non - thermal emission has not been obtained . with chandra , @xcite studied diffuse x - ray emission @xmath2 from the center of westerlund  2 and found that the spectrum could be represented by both thermal and non - thermal emission .    in this paper , we report the results from suzaku observations of westerlund  2 . since suzaku has a large collecting area and low background @xcite , it is the best instrument for observations of dim and diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",

    "westerlund  2 was observed with suzaku on 2008 august 911 and 2009 february 45 .",
    "the exposure times for the two observations are 73.7  ks and 33.5  ks , respectively .",
    "the data of the two observations are dealt together in the following analysis .",
    "suzaku has three working xis ccds @xcite .",
    "two of them ( xis  0 , and 3 ) are front - illuminated ( fi ) and one ( xis  1 ) is back - illuminated ( bi ) .",
    "the xis was operated in the normal full - frame clocking mode .",
    "the edit mode was @xmath5 and @xmath6 and we combined the data of both modes for our analysis .",
    "we employed the following calibration files : xis ( 20090203 ) and xrt ( 20080709 ) .",
    "events with asca grades of 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 were retained .",
    "we excluded the data obtained at the south atlantic anomaly , during earth occultation , and at the low elevation angles from earth rim of @xmath7 .",
    "we further excluded the data with elevation angle from the rim of the shining earth smaller than @xmath8 .",
    "[ fig : xis_im ] is a raw xis image of westerlund  2 .",
    "we analyze the spectrum of the diffuse emission around westerlund  2 .",
    "since the angular resolution of the xis is moderate ( @xmath9 ) , we need to estimate the amount of x - ray emission from point sources that contaminate the diffuse x - ray emission from the cluster ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . moreover , since the diffuse emission is faint , the background spectrum must be constructed carefully .",
    "errors on fitted spectral parameters are given at the 90% confidence level from now on .      in order to estimate the contamination of the point sources",
    ", we used chandra archive data of westerlund  2 ( i d 3501 , 6410 , and 6411 ) . in order to extract the positions and spectra of the point sources",

    "ae produces spectral files for individual point sources . for the 9 brightest sources with photon counts of @xmath11 , we can treat their spectra separately . for fainter point sources , it is difficult to obtain their individual spectra because of their small photon counts . thus , we combined their spectral files by mathpha included in ftools . for that purpose",
    ", we used the data of 570 point sources , which are well - separated from their neighboring sources , and their background spectra can be obtained around them .",
    "we assume that the spectral shapes of the individual fainter sources are the same as that of the combined spectrum but their luminosities are different .    using the positional and spectral data",

    "( 80mm,80mm)f2.eps      since the tev gamma - ray emission from westerlund  2 covers the entire xis field @xcite , we used the spectrum of a blank region around swiftj1010.15747 obtained with suzaku ( , [ j2000.0 ] ) as the background of westerlund  2 .",
    "the exposure time is 38  ks .",
    "we call this region the blank region .",

    "the galactic coordinates of westerlund  2 and the blank region are @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively . westerlund  2 and the blank region",
    "are both affected by the galactic ridge x - ray emission ( grxe ; @xcite ) .",
    "we subtract the non - x - ray instrumental background ( nxb ) from the spectrum of the blank region .",
    "the nxb is constructed from night earth data , and is generated by the routine xisnxbgen included ftools , considering the time - variation of the nxb @xcite .",
    "we calculate the effective area for the suzaku xis chips using xissimarfgen , which provides the ancillary response file ( arf ) through monte carlo simulations @xcite . after the nxb",
    "is subtracted and removing a few noticeable point sources brighter than @xmath15 in the 210  kev band , we fit the x - ray emission from the blank region with spectral components of the grxe , the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , and the local hot bubble ( lhb ) .",
    "we assume that the contribution of faint point sources ( @xmath16 in the 210  kev band ) , which chandra could have detected with an exposure time of @xmath17  ks , to the suzaku spectrum of the blank region can be ignored , because @xcite found that the contribution of point sources brighter than @xmath18 ( 210  kev ) to the grxe is only @xmath19  % ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the spectrum of the grxe can be represented by two thermal models ( vapec ) , and two absorptions ( phabs ) with a combination of @xmath20 .",
    "the spectra of the cxb and the lhb are represented by an absorbed power - law model ( @xmath21 ) and a thermal model ( apec ) , respectively . for the cxb spectrum",
    ", we use the results of @xcite for power and those of @xcite and @xcite for phabs .",
    "since the region around westerlund  2 is affected by the grxe , we use the average of the lhb spectra at positions @xmath22 away from westerlund  2 in the direction of galactic latitude @xcite .",
    "the temperature of the lhb is 0.1  kev .",
    "the parameters for the grxe in the blank region are shown in table  [ tab : blank ] .",
    "the best - fit values for the grxe are derived by fixing all the parameters of the spectra of the cxb and the lhb at their best - fit values . for the groupings of metals , we refer to the results in @xcite . for the errors ,",
    "we include not only statistical errors but also systematic errors made by a spatial variation of the intensity of the cxb .",
    "@xcite estimated the spatial variation of the cxb is @xmath23  % for the asca field .",
    "we adjusted the value to be consistent with the xis field . moreover , since we masked the regions around bright point sources ( @xmath24% of the xis field ) , we consider the decrease of the effective area in the field .",
    "thus , we adopt the systematic error of 16% for the cxb flux .",
    ".best - fit parameters for the grxe [ cols=\"<,<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we found that the spectrum of the gas component of westerlund  2 can be represented by three thermal models ( 3 t ) or two thermal models and one power - law model ( 2tp ) . since the power - law component in 2tp model can be replaced by a thermal component , the power - law component when the contributions of the grxe and the cxb to the total spectrum are minimum gives the upper limit of non - thermal x - ray flux from the cluster . assuming that the non - thermal emission comes from the entire xis field , the upper limit of the flux is @xmath25 ( 0.72  kev ) and @xmath26 ( 0.710  kev ) . in this estimation , we compensate for the x - rays from the masked regions with those from the surrounding regions .    although the photon counts are small for detailed spectral analysis , we found that x - ray surface brightness of a region that is @xmath27 away from the cluster in the xis field ( the center of the circle is shifted from the cluster center according to the surface brightness contours ) is comparable to the one estimated from the blank region .",
    "thus , the emission from the outside of the xis field does not much contribute to the total diffuse emission from westerlund  2 .",
    "we also analyzed the hxd data of suzaku . adopting a systematic uncertainty of 5% for the nxb",
    ", we found that the upper limit of the x - ray flux from westerlund  2 in the 1540  kev band is @xmath28 , excluding the cxb and the grxe .",
    "we assumed that the spectrum of the cxb is represented by a power - law model multiplied by a highecut model in xspec .",
    "we adopted the power - law index of 1.29 , the power - law normalization of @xmath29 , and the e - folding energy of 40  kev , following a standard model .",
    "the spectrum of the grxe is extrapolated from the one in the soft x - ray band .",
    "the upper limit of the flux from westerlund  2 can be compared with the extrapolated values of 3 t and 2tp models ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "considering that the hxd has a wider field ( @xmath31 ) than the xis , this result indicates that it is unlikely that strong hard x - ray emission extends beyond the xis field .      in figure",
    "[ fig : flux ] , we present multi - wavelength measurements of westerlund  2 .",
    "the radio flux is considered as an upper limit , because it could only partially include the non - thermal radio flux produced by the energetic electrons @xcite .",
    "the einstein observations probably overestimate the diffuse flux , because the limited spatial resolution may not allow the subtraction of the point sources well enough @xcite . the flux obtained with egret",
    "may also need to be regarded as an upper limit , because of its low spatial resolution ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)f5.eps    with chandra , @xcite found that the diffuse x - ray emission from westerlund  2 can be represented by three thermal components ( @xmath33 , 0.8 , and 3.1  kev ) , which is consistent with our 3 t model ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "@xcite indicated that the hottest component can be replaced with a power - law component ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this photon index is also consistent with that in table  [ tab : fit ] .",
    "@xcite estimated that the flux of the power - law component is @xmath35 ( 0.710  kev ) .",
    "the difference from our best - fit value ( @xmath36 ; see table  [ tab : fit ] ) could be due to the difference of the regions investigated , and the backgrounds adopted .",
    "@xcite focused on a narrower region ( @xmath2 from the center of westerlund  2 ) , and they took a background in the same chandra field .",
    "thus , the flux should be regarded as an lower limit . on the other hand ,",
    "since the power - law component can be replaced by a thermal component , the flux could also be regarded as an upper limit ( figure  [ fig : flux ] ) .    with the high - quality of the suzaku spectrum and the wide region we covered",
    ", we think that we have obtained the strictest upper limit of the diffuse non - thermal emission from westerlund  2 so far .",
    "since westerlund  2 has more than ten o  stars and two wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars @xcite , the strong winds from them may currently accelerate particles , which may be responsible for the tev gamma - ray emission from the cluster . considering the source extention ,",
    "it is unlikely that a single star produces the gamma - ray emission @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite calculated broad band spectra of westerlund  2 ; they chose parameters so that the spectra are consistent with previous gamma - ray and x - ray observations .",
    "they predicted that synchrotron emission from accelerated electrons could be observed in the x - ray band . assuming that the distance to westerlund  2 is 8  kpc and particles are injected uniformly during the lifetime of a wr star",
    ", @xcite predicted that the x - ray flux would be @xmath37 at @xmath38  kev . assuming that the distance to the cluster is 2.8  kpc",
    ", @xcite predicted that the x - ray flux would be @xmath3@xmath39 at @xmath38  kev , depending on the injection time - scale . on the other hand ,",
    "our new suzaku results show that the upper limit of the non - thermal emission is @xmath40 ( 0.72  kev ) , which is much smaller than the above predictions ( figure  [ fig : flux ] )",
    ". it would be difficult to adjust the parameters of the theoretical models to match both the new x - ray constraint and the previous gamma - ray observations , because the models must satisfy the relatively large ratio of gamma - ray to x - ray energy flux .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered jet and arc - like molecular feature around westerlund  2 .",
    "in particular , the latter suggests a past stellar explosion ( or past stellar explosions ) in the cluster . based on this observation",
    ", we consider particle acceleration associated with the explosion .",
    "the total mass of the molecular gas around westerlund  2 is @xmath41 and the size is @xmath42  pc @xcite . if the molecular cloud before the explosion of the star had almost the same mass and size , the average proton number density is @xmath43 .",
    "if the star explodes @xmath44  yrs ago in the molecular cloud with the kinetic energy of @xmath45  erg , the current velocity and radius of the shock wave is @xmath46 and @xmath47  kpc , respectively ( see equation  2 in @xcite",
    ". the radius can be obtained by the integration of the velocity ) .",
    "the velocity is comparable to the internal velocity of the molecular gas , and the size is comparable to that of the arc ( @xmath42  pc ) observed around westerlund  2 @xcite .",
    "although the shock may still be expanding , it is unlikely that particles are accelerated at the shock at present because of the small velocity .",
    "however , particles might be accelerated in the past when the velocity of the shock was large .",
    "if adiabatic energy loss did not much affect the particle energy , the accelerated protons should not have lost their energy because of their long cooling time .",
    "thus , the protons accelerated in the past may be producing the tev gamma - rays through @xmath48-interactions in the surrounding molecular gas . on the other hand , accelerated electrons should have lost their energy through synchrotron emission .",
    "therefore , the current ratio of gamma - ray to x - ray energy flux should be large , because the electrons are the source of the x - ray flux through synchrotron emission @xcite .",
    "this is consistent with the observations of westerlund  2 ; the observed ratio of the 110  tev energy flux to the 210  kev energy flux is @xmath49 , which actually indicates that the stellar explosion did not happen recently @xcite .",
    "such stellar explosions in dense clouds could be the sources of unidentified tev sources and the so - called pamela anomaly @xcite .",
    "the mass of the star responsible for the explosion could be extremely large , because stars in an open cluster form almost simultaneously and massive stars with @xmath50 still survive in westerlund  2 @xcite .",
    "in general , such massive stars produce ejecta with a large @xmath51-element to iron abundance ratio @xcite .",
    "this trend is consistent with the metal abundances shown in table  [ tab : fit ] , although the contribution from stellar winds from surviving stars must be considered for detailed analysis .",
    "if the thermal gas in 3 t model is uniformly distributed within @xmath52 from the cluster center , the total gas mass is @xmath53 . from the metal abundances in table  [ tab : fit ] ,",
    "the masses of si and s contained in the gas are estimated to be @xmath54@xmath55 and @xmath54@xmath56 , respectively . since a star with a mass of @xmath57 produces @xmath58 of si and @xmath59 of s @xcite , explosions of a few massive stars are enough to produce observed si and s , even if metals that originate from sources other than the stellar explosions are not considered . since some of the stars with masses of @xmath60 explode as hypernovae @xcite , the one exploded in westerlund  2 might be such a hypernova and might trigger a gamma - ray burst .",
    "however , because of the large errors for the metal abundances in table  [ tab : fit ] and the lack of the knowledge about the mass of the progenitor star , we can not firmly determine whether the progenitor star is a supernova or a hypernova from the metal abundances @xcite .",
    "it is to be noted that pure hadronic models could not account for the gev gamma - ray radiation detected by egret at the position of westerlund  2 @xcite . in the near future",
    ", fermi will reveal whether the gev gamma - ray source is related to the tev gamma - ray source in westerlund  2 and by what mechanism the gamma - ray radiation is produced ( figure  [ fig : flux ] ) .",
    "we observed the young open cluster westerlund  2 with suzaku x - ray satellite .",
    "we found that diffuse x - ray emission extends to @xmath61 from the cluster center .",
    "we analyze the spectrum considering the contamination from point sources using chandra data .",
    "we found that the diffuse emission consists of three thermal components ( @xmath62 , 0.9 , and 4  kev ) or two thermal components ( @xmath62 and 1.0  kev ) and one non - thermal component ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the upper limit of the non - thermal energy flux is smaller than the tev gamma - ray energy flux observed with h.e.s.s .",
    "the abundances of @xmath51-elements are relatively high in comparison with that of iron .",
    "the relatively high x - ray to gamma - ray energy flux ratio suggests that the gamma - ray emission is attributed to protons that were accelerated in the past , because the cooling time of the high - energy protons is much longer than that of high - energy electrons , and the electrons that are responsible for synchrotron x - ray emission may have cooled .",
    "considering the structures in molecular gas surrounding the cluster , protons would have been accelerated at a shock created through a stellar explosion that happened @xmath64@xmath65 yrs ago . since extremely massive stars ( @xmath50 )",
    "still survive in this cluster , the star responsible for the explosion would also have been very massive .",
    "the high abundances of @xmath51-elements compared with iron may support this idea .",
    "thus , the progenitor star could have exploded as a hypernova rather than as a normal supernova .",
