    "the weak value is a derived notion of the weak measurement proposed by aharonov et al @xcite , which has brought a new understanding of quantum observations .",
    "the weak measurement @xcite means that it hardly disturbs the quantum superposed state when it is performed with large uncertainty .",
    "the reason of the strange nature of this quantum measurement is that the weak value is defined as an expectation over strongly restricted paths with the condition of the post - selected final state .",
    "suppose we have started from a pre - selected initial state at @xmath0 .",
    "if we measure some observable @xmath1 at @xmath2 , the wave function @xmath3 collapses to one of the eigenstates of @xmath1 .",
    "and we can find only the probability distribution @xmath4 , not the probability amplitude @xmath3 , by repeating the measurement and adopting all of the observed data .",
    "if we discard the main data by restricting the paths to the post - selected ones only , we can expect to get some informations on the state @xmath3 before collapsing , because the post - selected paths are described with the same propagator as the forward evolution of the pre - selected paths by changing only the sign of the time @xmath5 according to the time - reversal symmetry of quantum mechanics .",
    "the weak value of an observable @xmath1 with a given initial state @xmath6 at @xmath0 and a final state @xmath7 at @xmath8 is defined by@xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the hamiltonian and the unit @xmath11 is used .",
    "this quantity is related to a _",
    "weak measurement _ as follows : let us introduce a _ meter _ to measure the observable @xmath1 of the target system at @xmath12 by a weak interaction @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the momentum operator of the probe of the meter and @xmath15 is a small coupling constant .",
    "suppose the initial state of the meter , @xmath16 in the coordinate representation of the probe position @xmath17 has a sufficiently broad uncertainty @xmath18 , i.e. a variance @xmath19 .",
    "it can be easily shown that for the restricted paths from @xmath20 to @xmath21 , the meter state for @xmath22 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is used .",
    "note that the weak value defined by eq.([ht - wv ] ) is complex in general .",
    "then the shift of the expectation of the probe position @xmath17 is given by the real part of the weak value , @xmath25 $ ] , while the shift of the expectation of the momentum @xmath14 is found to be equal to the imaginary part , @xmath26 $ ] by using a fourier transformation .",
    "an early interpretation of the quantity defined by eq.([ht - wv ] ) is the probability _ _",
    "amplitude__@xcite which yields a pre- and post - selected , two - time conditional probability ( ttcp ) .",
    "when it is applied to a projection operator @xmath27 onto one of the eigenstates of an observable @xmath1 , one finds @xmath28 the last expression is to be shown equal to @xmath29 in sec.3 by using bayes identities .",
    "( see the footnote c in sec.3 . ) here @xmath30 is the standard notation for a conditional probability with a condition @xmath31 ( or a transition probability from the state @xmath31 to @xmath32 ) , e.g. @xmath33    another interpretation , somewhat formal one , is the ttcp itself.@xcite let us rewrite the usual quantum expectation of @xmath34 with respect to a state @xmath35 in the following identical form , @xmath36 ) is @xmath37 .",
    "this may yield an interpretation of the weak value as a complex , raw stochastic variable .",
    "nevertheless , if it is applied to @xmath38 again , it reads as a conditional probability equation , @xmath39 in addition , we have a sum - rule , @xmath40 because of the completeness , @xmath41 .",
    "therefore , if we remind a type of the bayes statistics relations , + for the bayes identity , see the equation @xmath42 in the footnote c in sec.3 . ]",
    "@xmath43 the weak value of the projection operator @xmath38 , though it may be _ complex _ , can be interpreted formally as a ttcp itself with a couple of pre- and post - selections , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "further , the weak value of an operator @xmath44 , or @xmath45 in general , can be interpreted as the two - time conditional expectations ( ttce ) of them with respect to this virtual ttcp .",
    "because of this rather fictitious interpretation , the virtual conditional probability happens to be _",
    "_ negative__@xcite and it causes an abnormal enhancement of the weak value of some observables greater than their inherent norms.@xcite these strange behaviors are closely related .",
    "that is , at least if a probability set @xmath46 is real , it can be expected that we have a partial sum satisfying @xmath47 whenever there exists a negative part .",
    "this is the essential reason of a possibility of the unusual enhancement of some expectations . @xcite",
    "the purpose of the present work is to emulate these strange behaviors clearer by using a classical stochastic model , in which we can avoid the ambiguity of the complex probability in the above quantum problem @xcite .",
    "we survey a conventional transformation of the stochastic master equation to a self - adjoint form in the following section .",
    "a good analogy with the quantum mechanics is found by applying it to the ttcp .",
    "this is shown in sec.3 .",
    "an example of the stochastic ising model which shows an abnormal enhancement of the expectations of some quantities with respect to ttcp is given in sec.4 .",
    "in sec.5 we discuss an extension of ttcp to a density matrix form to complete the analogy with the quantum mechanics .",
    "the last section is devoted to brief summary and discussions .",
    "first let us survey the well - known transformation @xcite to a self - adjoint form of the stochastic master equation .    let be a set of stochastic variable(s ) described by a time - dependent conditional probability , @xmath48 for @xmath49 , which obeys the following stationary , markovian master equation , i.e. the chapman - kolmogorov _ forward _ equation , @xmath50 where @xmath51 the matrix @xmath52 has an eigenvalue @xmath53 corresponding to the steady state , @xmath54",
    "let us introduce a _ wave function _ related to this forward conditional probability by @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",
    "this function @xmath57 obeys the forward wave equation , @xmath58 where @xmath10 is defined by @xmath59 for the time being the initial condition @xmath60 in @xmath57 is abbreviated .",
    "the function @xmath61 is an eigenfunction of eq.([ht - forward ] ) for @xmath53 .",
    "the merit of this transformation is that the eigenvalue problem of a given master equation is simplified , if the matrix @xmath10 is symmetric , i.e. @xmath62 this situation is widely expected when the detailed balance condition , i.e. the time - reversal symmetry @xcite , @xmath63 or equivalently , @xmath64 is satisfied . in this case",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath10 are all real , and non - negative , if the steady state is stable .",
    "therefore , @xmath61 is the ground state .",
    "a useful example is the fokker - planck equation for a single , continuous stochastic variable @xmath17 , @xmath65p(x , t),~ { \\cal l}[x]=-\\htdf{}{x}\\left(f'(x)+\\frac{\\epsilon}{2}\\htdf{}{x}\\right),\\ ] ] which describes a one - dimensional brownian motion in a potential @xmath66 with a small diffusion constant @xmath67 . by using its steady state solutions ,",
    "@xmath68~~\\mbox{and}~~ \\phi_0(x)\\propto \\exp\\left [ -f(x)/\\epsilon \\right],\\ ] ] we find the continuous variable version of the above formulations , @xmath69=\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\left [ -\\frac{\\epsilon^2}{2}\\htddf{}{x}+v(x)\\right],~~ v(x)=\\frac{1}{2}\\left [ f'(x)^2-\\epsilon f''(x)\\right].\\ ] ] thus the fokker - planck equation is transformed into a self - adjoint form of an imaginary - time schrdinger equation , @xmath70\\psi(x , t),\\ ] ] and its eigenvalue problem results in a familiar one of the quantum mechanics .",
    "figure.1 shows an early application @xcite to the so - called kramers escape problem .",
    "the stochastic decay ( or escape ) rate of the metastable state in a double - well potential @xmath66 is given by the first excited eigenvalue @xmath71 of the corresponding schrdinger potential @xmath72 .",
    "the first excited state is almost degenerate with the ground state for a small diffusion constant @xmath67 .",
    "so far the quantum mechanical reformulation merely helps us to simplify the eigenvalue problem of a given master equation .",
    "none of remarkable quantum mechanical phenomena appears , until we are concerned with the ttcp , @xmath73 by using the markovian property and the well - known relation between joint and conditional probabilities repeatedly , ] we find in abbreviated notations , @xmath74 where the markovness , i.e. @xmath75 is assumed for the time order @xmath76 . by applying the identity @xmath42 to @xmath77 again ,",
    "we obtain a symmetric expression , @xmath78 where the first denominator @xmath79 is given by @xmath80 because of the normalization condition , @xmath81 . ]",
    "the ttcp can be written in the following form with a pair of wave functions as @xmath82 where the associated wave function denoted by @xmath83 is related to the so - called  _ posterior _ conditional probability ,  @xmath84 for @xmath85 ,  by @xmath86 and obeys the _ backward _ wave equation , @xmath87 here @xmath88 is the hermite conjugate of @xmath10 , i.e. the transposed matrix in the present case .",
    "the eigensystem is common with the forward equation eq.([ht - forward ] ) , when @xmath10 is hermitian , i.e. real and symmetric as has been assumed here .",
    "the denominator in eq.([ht - twotime ] ) is the weight of overlap between the two wave functions defined by an inner product , @xmath89 of course this quantity is real , while the corresponding quantity in the quantum mechanics is complex in general .",
    "let us define the ket- and the bra - vectors by @xmath90 then the wave equations eqs.([ht - forward ] ) and ( [ ht - backward ] ) by assuming @xmath91 are rewritten in the quantum mechanical form as @xmath92 respectively .",
    "henceforth , @xmath10 is called the hamitonian .    by using this pair of the schrdinger equations",
    "it is shown that the overlap integral , or the inner product @xmath93 given by eq.([ht - inner ] ) does not depend on the current time @xmath5 , i.e. @xmath94 it should be noted that the present wave function @xmath57 satisfies a conservation law only in this meaning eq.([ht - inner ] ) coupled with its adjoint @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , it can be shown that this overlap integral has the following properties in the respective limits ; @xmath95^{-1 } \\delta(\\htxf-\\htxi ) .",
    "\\end{array}\\ ] ]    note that the ttce ( two - time conditional expectation ) of a physical quantity @xmath1 with respect to ttcp defined by @xmath96 has just the analogous form of the weak value in the quantum mechanics .",
    "thus the ttcp is a nonlinear quantity composed of a product of a pair of the forward and the backward wave functions , and can not be described by a closed , linear evolution equation .",
    "then it happens that the principle of the probability superposition is violated and the interference of wave functions may occur .",
    "however , its example is omitted here because none of remarkable phenomena from this view point has been found , yet .",
    "the reason may be that the wave functions are always _ real _ and positive in the present case .",
    "therefore , let us discuss only the weak value in the rest .",
    "an example is a pair of the classical ising spin @xmath97 having an exchange interaction , @xmath98 where @xmath99 .",
    "let us number the stochastic variable @xmath100 in the order , @xmath101 ,  @xmath102 ,  @xmath103 ,  @xmath104 and choose the following transition matrices , @xmath105 where @xmath106 .",
    "evidently this transition matrix @xmath107 satisfies the detailed balance condition , @xmath108 at the steady state , i.e. the thermal equilibrium of a temperature @xmath109 . with the use of the equilibrium distribution function ,",
    "@xmath110 we find the corresponding hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the usual pauli matrices and @xmath114 denotes the two dimensional unit matrix @xmath115 .",
    "this is the hamiltonian of a pair of _ quantum _ ising spins with an exchange interaction in a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the eigenvalues and the eigenstates of this hamiltonian @xmath10 , @xmath116 , \\\\",

    "the familiar notations @xmath118 are used for @xmath97 .",
    "note that the first excited state is almost degenerate with the ground state for a small transition probability @xmath119 .    by using this eigensystem",
    "we can calculate the state vectors , @xmath120 and @xmath121 for arbitrary initial and final states in just the same manner of the elementary quantum mechanics except for the fact that the time @xmath5 is imaginary .",
    "strange behaviors can be expected only when the paths from @xmath20 to @xmath21 are very rare cases , because the post - selection causes little effect when the paths are dominant ones .",
    "then let us consider the case where the initial and the final states differ from each other .",
    "let @xmath122 that is , @xmath123 or equivalently , @xmath124 by using the eigenvector expansion we obtain , @xmath125 and @xmath126    the ttcp is shown in figure.2 .",
    "this result itself is very natural and well - expected , all probabilities being always non - negative .",
    "0.3 cm    a strange behavior appears when we use the basis @xmath127 , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath10 instead of the spin states @xmath128 .",
    "we can calculate the virtual probability , i.e. the ttce of the projection operator @xmath129 onto each eigenstate @xmath130 in the same manner .",
    "the result is given by @xmath131 the fictitious negative probability is found in @xmath132 .",
    "of course the completeness of the probability , @xmath133 is satisfied evidently because of eq.([ht - overlap ] ) .",
    "this negativity is precisely expected from the signs of the expansion coefficients of the eigenvectors in the right side of eq.([ht - eigensystem ] ) .",
    "some of inner products @xmath134 between two basis systems @xmath135 and @xmath136 are found to be negative .",
    "then some part of the virtual ttcp happens to be negative , when the initial and the final states differ from each other .    on the contrary ,",
    "when the both states are the same , this situation can not be expected , because the negative inner products , if any , would be squared .",
    "for example , when we select as @xmath137 we find the corresponding virtual probabilities all positive , i.e. ] from the present definitions eq.([braket ] ) of them , and the overlap integral @xmath138 in the denominators is better to be written explicitly as @xmath139 , or @xmath140 to avoid a confusion , as if @xmath141 in the usual quantum mechanical notation . ]",
    "@xmath142 where @xmath143    this is a general conclusion for two different bases @xmath144 and @xmath145 of any _ real _ vector space , because at least one of the inner products , @xmath146 must be negative .",
    "that is , the negative probability can be expected at least when    * the initial and the final states differ from each other , * and the orthogonal basis of the intermediate projection differs from the basis of the initial and the final selections , so that one of the inner products is negative .",
    "the same situation may occur in the quantum system between different sets of eigenvectors of _ non - commutative _ observables , say , @xmath147 .",
    "when we select the initial and the final states as different eigenstates of @xmath148 , the virtual ttcp , i.e. the weak value of the projection operator @xmath27 onto some of the eigenstates of @xmath1 can be negative .",
    "this setting is sufficient for the condition @xcite to find the strange weak value .    0.5 cm    -0.5 cm    a strange behavior related to this negative probability is the abnormal enhancement of some observables as is stated in sec.1 .",
    "an example is shown in fig.3 for a quantity , say , the _ transverse magnetization _",
    ", @xmath149 an abnormal behavior @xmath150\\nonumber\\\\ & > & 1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is found for sufficiently small @xmath14 and @xmath151 .",
    "note that the natural norm of @xmath152 must be less than 1 , because the eigenvalue spectrum of @xmath152 is @xmath153 .",
    "when the transition rate is very small , i.e. @xmath154 , we find @xmath155 a plain reason of this singular behavior is that the overlap integral @xmath156 in the denominator may be expected to be very small owing to ( ii ) of eq.([ht - limit0 ] ) , whenever the initial and the final states differ from each other , i.e. @xmath157 .",
    "this means that to reach @xmath158 starting from @xmath159 in a given time occurs scarcely and is far from the main flow of the conditional probability . on the contrary",
    "none of such strange behaviors are found when @xmath160 , e.g. @xmath161 .",
    "the result for the latter case for the same parameters as the upper abnormal case is shown by the lower curve in fig.3 , its maximum being @xmath162 at @xmath163 and minimum @xmath164 at @xmath165 and @xmath151 .    in fig.4 the ttce of another quantity @xmath166 having a spectrum @xmath167 are shown also .",
    "note that @xmath168 is commutative with @xmath10 and is a conserved quantity .",
    "then the horizontal axis in this figure shows a parameter of the transition probability instead of the current time itself .    0.5 cm    -0.5",
    "cm    * ( single spin model ) *  the previous model having an energy barrier is aimed at realizing the rare paths from @xmath20 to @xmath21 in order to find out a strange weak value easily .",
    "after the symposium , however , the author noticed that a single , free ising spin system provides a simpler example .",
    "an ising spin flips up - to - down and down - to - up randomly .",
    "a transition probability may be defined by @xmath169 whose equilibrium state is @xmath170 then , the hamiltonian for this classical stochastic model is given by as shown by this hamiltonian . ]",
    "@xmath171 another eigenstate , i.e. the excited state is @xmath172 that is , the two eigenstates of @xmath10 are those of @xmath112 itself , i.e. the hadamard states , @xmath173 then we find @xmath174 and @xmath175 by using the eigenvector expansion , where the negative expansion coefficient appears .",
    "after the same procedures as the previous model we obtain an extraordinary ttcp , @xmath176 and a strange weak value , @xmath177 again .    on the contrary ,",
    "when @xmath178 , we find an ordinary ttcp , @xmath179 and @xmath180    thus the origin of the negative probability and the strange weak value is more obvious in this simplest system .",
    "it should be noted that the physical quantities @xmath152 and @xmath168 in the previous section are _ non - diagonal _ in the spin - state representation and have no corresponding quantities in the classical ising spin system .",
    "they are related to the transition rate of the stochastic ising spin . in order to calculate the expectations of such non - diagonal quantities we need an extension of the ttcp to the two - time conditional density matrix defined by @xmath181 from the definition eq.([ht - inner ] ) of the overlap integral @xmath156 , it is evident that @xmath182 it should be noted , however , that the diagonal elements of this density matrix are not always positive as is shown by eq.([ht - projection ] ) in sec.4 , when it is diagonalized by using the basis @xmath183 , the eigenstates of the hamiltonian @xmath10 .    with the use of this density matrix the definition eq.([ht - ttce ] ) of the ttce",
    "is extended as @xmath184 of course this definition of the ttce results in the classical one , if @xmath1 is a diagonal quantity .",
    "the notion of this density matrix has not been used in the conventional classical stochastic process .",
    "it should be emphasized , however , that this quantity is within a scheme of the classical stochastic process itself , because the wave functions , @xmath57 and @xmath83 in eq.([ht - density ] ) are related to the forward and the posterior , classical conditional probabilities , respectively .",
    "in addition , we have an alternative expression for @xmath83 , @xmath185 or equivalently , @xmath186 for @xmath187 due to the time - reversal symmetry corresponding to the detailed balance . then the density matrix eq.([ht - density ] ) can be written as @xmath188 while the overlap integral can be re - defined by @xmath189 this fact means that we can define the ttcp and the corresponding density matrix with only a pair of the usual , forward conditional probabilities for two individual initial states , @xmath190 and @xmath191 .",
    "we need no data discarding due to the post - selection .",
    "except for the facts that the time is imaginary and the wave function is always real and positive , the classical stochastic process can be described in an analogous form of the quantum mechanics , if we use the ttcp .",
    "for example , the abnormal behaviors of the weak value in the quantum mechanics are emulated .",
    "the ttcp and its ttce , i.e. the weak values are always real in the present classical case .",
    "therefore , the origin of such abnormal behaviors is clearer than the quantum mechanical case where complex quantities appear .    in addition , if we have not the explicit solution of the eigenvalue problem , we may calculate the weak value at least with use of a monte - carlo simulation which is often used to investigate the stochastic model . in performing a simulation it should be noted that we can calculate the ttcp and its ttce with two usual , forward conditional probabilities for respective _ initial _ conditions , the pre - selected and the post - selected ones , when the detailed balance condition is satisfied .",
    "the importance of the weak value in the quantum mechanics is that it is related to the new notion of the weak measurement without disturbing the quantum state .",
    "an analogous notion of the latter in the classical stochastic process , if any , has not been found yet .",
