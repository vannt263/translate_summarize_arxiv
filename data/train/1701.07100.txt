    "as previously described @xcite , muvi spim optical stability allows a fusion strategy based on a diagnostic specimen .",
    "recorded once per experiment , the diagnostic specimen is used to determine an initial guess for an affine transformation , which we feed into a rigid image registration algorithm @xcite , to fuse individual views , resulting in an isotropic resolution of @xmath28 in the registered image .",
    "we used tissue cartography to extract surfaces of interest ( soi ) from embryos@xcite .",
    "briefly we identify the outline of the sample using the ilastik detector to determine a point cloud for soi construction . in a fitting step ( implemented in the sphere - like fitter ) , we create a smooth description of the soi in terms of cylinder coordinates defined by ap axis and azimuth @xcite .",
    "image intensity data is then projected onto a nested group of @xmath29 layers ( @xmath30 normally evolved layers above and below the soi ) , each @xmath21 pixels apart , defining a @xmath31 thick curved image stack. for analysis the maximum intensity projection of nested layers was used .",
    "although the shape of embryos of the same genotype is highly reproducible , small differences in the underlying point cloud can result in small differences of the soi passing through the apical cell surface . to simplify comparison between embryos ,",
    "we create a standard projection on a cylinder grid of fixed size , with the embryo surface oriented such that apical is left , posterior right , dorsal in the centre , and ventral on top and bottom ( main text fig 1 ) .",
    "systematic distortions of measurements due to projecting the curved embryo surface to the plane are corrected using the metric tensor @xcite .",
    "the apical surface is static , while the dynamic basal cell surface moves with the cellularization front .",
    "projections of the latter could be created by reading signal on a surface obtained by evolving the apical soi along its normal basal wards .",
    "however , small differences in cell height ( @xmath32 of a typical cell height , and @xmath33 of the embryo diameter ) , could result in small but systematic bias of the soi around the cellularization front and impair projection quality .",
    "we avoid this problem by determining a new point cloud for each time point , for which we focus the ilastik detector on the interface between basal myosin and yolk .",
    "our model approximates the embryo as a thin shell ( see below ) , and hence as a 2d surface .",
    "therefore we map the dynamic basal cell surface onto the the standard cylinder grid for the static apical soi .",
    "we measure the flow field using the particle image velocimetry ( piv ) method , that identifies local displacements between two time points@xcite . briefly",
    ", we implemented the phase correlation method that leverages favorable execution times of fast fourier transforms , to estimate local flow in a region of interest on the projections @xcite . to minimize effect from systematic distortions towards polar regions on cylinder projections ,",
    "we adjust the size of the roi according to the local metric strain , which we define as the deflation of the metric from flat space@xcite .",
    "although gastrulation in _ drosophila _ is highly reproducible from embryo to embryo@xcite , in practical terms experiments are subject to a constant time shift , depending on the developmental stage of the sample at the start of imaging .",
    "thus we developed an automated routine that allowed us to identify a common time frame that the @xmath34 ( wt : @xmath35 , _",
    "twist_:@xmath23 , _ bcd nos tsl_:@xmath23 ) live - imaged embryos are registered to .",
    "specifically , we introduced a constant time shift for a given flow field , that minimizes the squared difference with respect to a reference flow field averaged over the embryo surface : @xmath36 , where @xmath37 denotes averaging across the embryo , @xmath38 is an arbitrary chosen reference from the ensemble , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 denote the @xmath41-th flow field and offset time respectively . in this way",
    ", we align samples to a chosen reference , in which we use the first occurrence of the cephalic furrow ( cf ) as a landmark indicating our choice for @xmath42 min . within a given genotype",
    ", we could automatically determine the offset time .",
    "however , to align mutants to wt , we first aligned all mutant datasets , and then used landmarks such as the cf ( _ twist _ ) , or the vf(_bcd nos tsp _ ) , to define a common time frame as best as we can .",
    "time shifted accordingly , we created an ensemble average flow field for each genotype : @xmath43    the magnitude of ensemble average is highly reproducible from embryo to embryo ( note the small standard deviation , fig [ velocityfigure]a ) .",
    "flow trajectories during cellularization point towards the dorsal side ( fig [ velocityfigure]b ) , showing persistent movement towards dorsal regions during pre - cf flow .",
    "this is accompanied by reduction of apical cell area in these regions ( fig [ velocityfigure]c ) , as measured using confocal microscopy . while the length of pre - vf flow lines peaks on the anterior and posterior poles in wt , it is substantially reduced near poles in _ twist _ , and only mildly reduced in _",
    "bcd nos tsl _",
    "( fig [ velocityfigure]d - f ) .",
    "together with the loss of basal dv asymmetry this suggests that _ twist _ mediated reduction of basal myosin levels on the ventral side is responsible for dorsal - ward flow .",
    "using the imaging and pre - processing procedure as outlined above with samples expressing sqhgfp @xcite , we created projections of the apical and basal cell surfaces , with the goal of establishing a quantitative measurement of global myosin patterns . ideally , quantification of signal intensities is carried out using identical conditions for each sample in the pool used for statistics , to minimize variability across samples . however , when performing _ in toto _ live - imaging , it is difficult to image more than one sample at a time and keep a high recording frequency . to minimize variability in a sequential recording scheme , we keep imaging conditions constant , but there are still possible variabilities in recorded signal intensity for biological but also technical reasons .    to account for such variability between experiments , we normalize recorded data .",
    "signal intensity of all time points in a given experiment are summarized by normalizing the intensity distribution : upper and lower range are determined according to the @xmath44 and @xmath45-percentile ; normalization is done by subtracting the @xmath46 and dividing by @xmath47 , yielding a dimensionless normalized signal distribution .",
    "this strategy should not only allow for comparison on the same microscope , but also across microscopes , allowing for validation of _ in toto _ live - imaging from sequential experiments against fixed batches imaged e.g. on a confocal .        here",
    "we briefly outline the results for the dv asymmetry in the basal myosin pool that we reported in the main text .",
    "first , we time align intensity normalized basal projections as described above .",
    "next we convolve each pullback with a gaussian of width @xmath48 cell diameters to obtain basal myosin at the mesoscale ( see discussion in model section below for definition ) .",
    "the results are then ensemble averaged to obtain ensemble myosin distribution as shown in fig .",
    "[ basalpullback ] . to assess dv asymmetry",
    ", we focus on the region outlined by the black / white dashed line , where we first take an average along the ap axis and then compute average signal on dorsal side , and subtract from it the average signal on the ventral side . repeating the outlined routine for all time points ,",
    "we obtain the plot show in main text fig 4b .",
    "[ basalspimvsconfocal]c shows dv cross sections of fixed embryos stained for rb anti zipper and mouse anti dorsal , cut along the ap axis , and imaged on a confocal microscope .",
    "dv orientation of the samples is automatically determined based on the dorsal signal . to estimate the age of fixed embryos in relation to live - imaging data , we constructed a calibration curve for cell apico - basal height shown in fig [ basalspimvsconfocal]a . using the known monotonic relation between cell height and age@xcite , which we find lasts until about @xmath49 after cf formation , we obtain estimate for the age of a fixed embryo based on measuring cell height . by segmenting the outline of basal myosin",
    ", we can then measure dv asymmetry in the same way as described for live - imaging data above .    a direct comparison between live - imaging based dv asymmetry measurement , and based on @xmath50 fixed dv cross sections from confocal shows that after applying normalization routine as described above , we find similar estimates for the dv asymmetry using both light sheet and confocal imaging ( see fig [ basalspimvsconfocal]b ) .",
    "not that uncertainties in the calibration curve propagate to exact age determination in the embryo , and thus increased fluctuations in dv asymmetry determined using confocal imaging .      when viewed in cross - section , the cell cortex in epithelia forms a polygon tiling , where the outline of each cell is well approximated by a closed sequence of edges .",
    "anisotropic distribution of proteins is often characterized by homogeneously increased accumulation to cell edges of particular orientation , while it remains homogeneously low and comparable to background on other edges@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "note that typically the number of edges at low and high signal accumulation are roughly equal .",
    "available methods to quantify cortical anisotropy mostly operate at the single cell level and construct a nematic tensor by integrating signal intensities along cell outlines@xcite . at the organismal scale membrane segmentation",
    "is costly , and for polarized markers low signal to noise on a significant number of edges often results in difficulties to close the cell circumference .",
    "we overcome the need for fiduciary markers that increase experiment complexity , by shifting perspective to cell edges and designing a robust and rapid segmentation free anisotropy detection algorithm .",
    "let s consider an image on a rectangular domain @xmath51 , showing an edge of possibly non - uniform intensity , assigning each pixel at coordinates @xmath52 some intensity @xmath53 - as shown e.g. in fig [ radonbasic ] .",
    "lets call this edge a * linear signal * or just signal . for simplicity , and without loss of generality , we assume the average intensity along the linear signal is @xmath54 , and average background intensity is @xmath55 . while under favorable conditions with high signal to noise ratio , it may be possible to identify the linear signal using conventional methods such as edge detection using a typical threshold , this task will be substantially more error prone at low signal to noise ratio .",
    "therefore , we decided to reformulate the problem using radon transforms @xcite , that integrate signal along lines of a given angle and signed distance from the origin .",
    "consider a line @xmath56 with normal @xmath57 , a signed normal distance @xmath58 away from the origin ( e.g. shown in pink in fig [ radonbasic ] , top left ) , which may be parametrized as follows @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the parameter that marks position along the line l ( fig [ radonbasic ] ) .",
    "it is clear that all possible pairs of normal orientation and signed distance @xmath61 , describes all possible lines covering the plane .",
    "the * radon transform * of the image @xmath62 - denoted @xmath63 - establishes a map from the rectangular domain @xmath51 , on which the image is defined into the space spanned by line orientation and signed distance , where each line @xmath56 characterized by the pair @xmath61 is assigned the integrated(summed ) intensity projection along the line - or in mathematical terms : @xmath64 , where the latter equation uses the explicit parametrization of the line @xmath56 in terms of @xmath65 defined above .",
    "( the following is a verbal example for the equation above , and may be skipped ) : fig [ radonbasic ] illustrates the algorithm that constructs the radon transform for the linear signal shown in white , that has a normal orientation of @xmath66 and constant intensity @xmath67 over a background of intensity @xmath68 .",
    "the magenta dashed line indicates a line @xmath56 with normal orientation @xmath69 and a distance @xmath70 away from the origin shown in red . integrating image intensity along such a line , for any orientation @xmath71",
    ", we theoretically obtain only a contribution from the intersection with the linear signal , thus @xmath72 .",
    "in contrast for @xmath73 , i.e. when the line is parallel and on top of the linear signal , the radon transform integrates the intensity along the entire line , returning the length @xmath74 of the linear signal : @xmath75 . in our example , for @xmath76 we will either have a single intersection of the line @xmath56 with the signal , again returning with the same outcome as above , or no intersection , where the radon transform returns @xmath22 , indicated by the dark blue regions in fig [ radonbasic ] .",
    "since the radon transform is linear , it follows that for any image that is the linear superposition of linear signals , the radon transform is the linear superposition of the radon transform of each linear signal . for example , if an image consisted of 2 linear signals ( for example a four fold vertex ) , the resulting radon transform is the sum of the radon transform of each linear signal , with peak levels at orientation and signed distance of each linear signal . in this way",
    ", linear signals are mapped to peaks in the radon transform that reflect the total intensity along the length of the linear signal . knowing the location of peaks in the radon transformed space allows us to reconstruct the position and orientation of each linear signal in the image .",
    "this simplifies the task of identifying the linear signal , as detection of peaks due to their compact structure is simpler than detection of edges , and the radon transformed signal will be less susceptible to fluctuations in the underlying data , and therefore enhance robustness .",
    "to obtain average image intensity from the radon transform we use that the height of the peak reflects the total intensity @xmath77 along the linear signal , to construct the average signal as @xmath78 where @xmath74 denotes the length of the linear signal . to determine the length of the linear signal",
    ", we need to determine the position of where the linear signal begins and/or ends in the image .",

    "pullbacks created with imsane based on light sheet microscopy data of developing _ drosophila melanogaster _",
    "embryos show the cortex of roughly @xmath79 cells , which would yield a complex radon transform pattern , effectively impeding peak detection . to simplify peak detection",
    ", we decided to carry out analysis in small blocks , where we focus on a local region of interest ( roi ) that we sweep across the entire image .",
    "the size of the local region is chosen such that it can accommodate between @xmath80 typical edge lengths @xmath81 . in this way",
    ", we typically obtain a small number ( @xmath82 ) of edges in the roi , such that we could use the extended - maxima transform@xcite to identify the typically well separated peaks . to avoid double counting of edges - as they may appear from sweeping the roi - we average detected lines of locally similar angles with a small angular difference @xmath83 and distance @xmath84 .",
    "following the general prescription given above , we obtain local estimates for position , orientation , and average intensities of cell edges , demonstrated in fig [ radondata ] .",
    "a zoom on a local region indicated by the white box shows that this routine - fully automatically , and without need of fine tuning parameters - faithfully detects the orientation of cell edges , including dim edges with only minimally stronger signal compared to background .",
    "to further benchmark the quality of intensity estimates , we turned to known anisotropy of myosin during germband extension @xcite .",
    "fig [ radondata ] shows on the right , that the presented algorithm finds the normalized intensity on ap edges ( @xmath25 ) is systematically higher than on dv edges ( @xmath85 ) , reaching is maximum approximately @xmath86 min after cephallic furrow formation , in good agreement with previous manual measurements @xcite .",
    "mechanics of epithelial tissue is largely defined by the properties of intracellular cytoskeletal cortexes , linked by cadherin mediated adherents junctions into a global trans - cellular mechanical network .",
    "this mechanical network is `` active '' in the sense that it involves myosin motors that generate internal forces and can do work by contracting actin - myosin filaments under tension .",
    "cytoskeletal network is also `` adaptive '' in the sense that it can relax mechanical stress by reorganizing internally , on sub - cellular scale by recruiting ( or releasing ) myosin and other key molecular components , and on tissue scale , by allowing cells to rearrange locally ( by t1 processes ) .",
    "the latter process allows cells to change neighbors and `` flow '' relative to each other , while preserving the integrity of the epithelium and its cytoskeletal network . yet , the detailed description of these complex cellular processes is not necessary for our present goals , which call merely for an approximate mesoscale description of tissue mechanics . by mesoscale we mean the scale of 3 - 10 cell diameters , still much smaller than the macroscopic scale of the embryo tissue flow .",
    "microscopic complexity notwithstanding , on mesoscale we will think of tissue as a continuous medium and it will suffice for us to capture the facts that i ) on short time scales tissue responds elastically to mechanical perturbations @xcite and ii ) on the longer time scales elastic stress is relaxed through active rearrangement of the cytoskeleton as cells adapt to the imposed deformation .",
    "this is enough to define flow velocity in response to external and internal stress : on the timescale comparable to internal stress relaxation , tissue dynamics can be described by a generic viscoelasticity equation with two effective viscosity parameters which we shall now derive .",
    "short - term elastic response means that incremental increase of strain causes an increase in stress , which can subsequently relax with the relaxation time @xmath87 .",
    "elastic stress is then governed by the maxwell viscoelasticity and in the mesoscopic continuum approximation we have : @xmath88 where @xmath89 so that @xmath90 is the rate of local displacement ( index @xmath91 denoting the spatial component assumed to be locally tangential to the surface of the embryo ) .",
    "spatial derivatives of the @xmath90 vector define local rate of strain @xmath92 .",
    "in addition , @xmath93 is the kronecker delta matrix and we have adopted the einstein convention of summing over repeated indices ( e.g. @xmath94 ) .",
    "the 1st two terms on the right hand side describe generation of stress in proportion to the rate of strain ( @xmath95 are the lame coefficients parameterizing an elastic stress - strain relation ) and the last term parameterizes relaxation of stress .    on the other hand , in the continuum approximation , tissue flow velocity @xmath96 can be described by the ( compressible ) stokes equation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is external force ( per unit volume ) , @xmath99 is the density and @xmath100-dynamic viscosity .",
    "now suppose that stress relaxation is sufficiently rapid to achieve quasi - equilibrium @xmath101 substituting @xmath102 into eq.2 we have @xmath103 note that transient elasticity , parameterized by @xmath104 and @xmath105 generates `` effective viscosity '' @xmath106 which can dominate the microscopic viscosity @xmath100 of the `` fluid '' itself .",
    "this effective viscosity is in general anisotropic with @xmath106 contributing to the shear viscosity which acts on the incompressible component of the flow and @xmath107 which acts on the irrotational component .",
    "if the effective viscosity is sufficiently high and flow changes sufficiently slowly , the inertial term can be neglected ( @xmath108 ) and the quasi - stationary flow is defined by the balance of the external forcing and effective viscosity @xmath109 where @xmath110 and @xmath111 . since external force is related to external stress via @xmath112 and we have argued that relevant `` external stress '' that drives tissue flow in the embryo is proportional to the myosin tensor @xmath113 we have arrived at the equation we have used in the main text to relate tissue flow velocity with myosin distribution . (",
    "note that the minus sign in the relation of @xmath102 and @xmath114 is due to the fact that myosin generates contractile forces , so that a local maximum of an isotropic myosin distribution @xmath115 would act just like a low pressure region , generate inward directed flow . )",
    "@xmath116      in the section above we put forward a simple effect model based on conventional maxwell viscoelasticity .",
    "epithelial tissues however are clearly not ordinary passive viscoelastic materials .",
    "myosin - driven rearrangement of the cytoskeleton is an active and adaptive process , which can be regulated on cellular and subcellular scales .",
    "yet , we argue , that average flow on mesoscopic scale can be usefully approximated by the passive viscoelastic model with suitable effective parameters .",
    "the ability of this simple model to capture highly non - trivial spatial flow patterns without the need for introducing spatial dependence of model parameters , proves the validity of the approximation .",
    "still , we do not expect this `` passive viscoelasticity '' model to be complete .",
    "we anticipate that a more detailed description of myosin activity and myosin recruitment dynamics would be required in order to describe both , the fast cellular scale fluctuations and the long - term myosin dynamics on the scale of the embryo .",
    "other molecular / genetic factors will come into play as well : e.g. cadherin and other cytoskeletal components on small scale and transcription factors that guide morphogenesis on large scales .",
    "we plan to address these issues in the future .",
    "inversion of the continuum equation of state relating the coarse - grained myosin tensor and cellular flow - field was achieved using finite element methods ( fem ) in the weak formulation implemented within the felicity toolbox for matlab @xcite .",
    "equations were inverted on a static triangular mesh representing the canonical embryo surface produced via a point cloud ( described above ) subsequently turned into a smooth triangulation using meshlab @xcite .",
    "as such , all objects within the equation of state had to be parameterized within the 3d embedding space of the mesh , which can be done by using the direction relation between projections and soi@xcite . the only dynamic input to this inversion algorithm is the divergence of the myosin tensor .",
    "this was computed by interpolating the gradient of each cartesian component of the tensor onto triangular faces of our mesh , producing a 3x3x3 object on each face . the partial trace of this object over directions within the tangent plane of the face result in the estimated divergence .",
    "this operation was repeated for all myosin pools used .",
    "all equations within the fem software are projected onto the surface of our 3d mesh to manually ensure solutions only exist within the tangent plane .    in order to model internalization of the vf",
    ", we introduced the ability to add a cut within the triangular mesh .",
    "contraction of the tissue was modeled by manually introducing local force dipoles on edges within the mesh pointing along the bond .",
    "all vertices along the cut were given zero bulk modulus to allow for local tissue compression needed to simulate invagination .",
    "the location of the cut was estimated from the piv flow fields .",
    "specifically the ratio of the divergence of the velocity field to the velocity field s magnitude was used to estimate the spatial extent of the cut over times during ventral furrow formation .",

    ", we define a global measure for the spatial residual that is insensitive to such a scale factor . with the short hand notation @xmath119 ,",
    "the residual      provides a spatial discrepancy map , indicating the prediction quality as a function of location on the embryo , that is in - sensitive to noise dominated fluctuations in domains of no flow ( i.e. fixed points ) , as opposed to e.g. inner product ."

    "<S> deficient @xmath5 mutant embryos is comparable to wt and @xmath4 mutants ( fig 4a ) . </S>",
    "<S> + in summary , we have presented a simple biophysical model of morphogenetic flow that quantitatively describes complex tissue motion in terms of a hydrodynamic equation parameterized by two effective viscosities . </S>",
    "<S> the flow is driven by the stress defined by a linear superposition of the spatial distributions of two myosin pools . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the basal myosin pool forms an isotropic and contiguous network @xcite , contracting in a similar fashion as purified actomyosin gels in vitro@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> imbalance within this network , caused by the @xmath4 dependent depletion of myosin on the ventral side , drives global dorsal - ward flow in the pre - vf phase , which continues to contribute until early gbe ( fig 4d ) . </S>",

    "<S> while local rate of cell intercalation is often interpreted in terms of local myosin distribution on cellular and sub - cellular scales , our model shows that the local rate of strain is a result of the tissue - wide distribution of forces generated by the spatial non - uniformity of myosin ( mathematically described by the divergence of the myosin tensor ) . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of spatial modulation ( fig 4d ) suggests a novel role of the dorsal signaling pathway in generation of gbe flow . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , in @xmath4 mutants both rate of increase as well as peak myosin anisotropy are significantly reduced in the first 20 minutes of gbe flow ( fig 4c ) . the reduced intercalation and strain rates observed in these mutants has been previously reported@xcite , and interpreted in terms of possible generation of ap forces by the internalized vf ( absent in @xmath4 mutants ) . </S>",
    "<S> our model accounts for the reduced rate of strain in terms of the changes in spatial distribution and the reduced level of myosin anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> this however brings up the question of how elimination of @xmath4 expression in the ventral mesoderm affects myosin anisotropy in the lateral ectoderm . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that this effect may be due to mechanical feedback on myosin recruitment , which relates the later to local rate of strain . through this dynamic recruitment effect @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , changes in the ventral region that modify global flow patterns can affect myosin distribution and anisotropy in the lateral region . in this way </S>",
    "<S> , local modification of the myosin pattern can produce not only a non - local perturbation of the flow , but also a non - local perturbation of myosin distribution . </S>",
    "<S> the global nature of the flow is reinforced by the observed transition towards areal incompressibility at the onset of gbe - flow , which together with reduced polarization kinetics and reduced strain rates observed in @xmath4 mutants , indicates that non - local consequences of stress generated largely in lateral ectoderm can account for the dorsal movement of the posterior midgut .    taken together , </S>",
    "<S> our observations show that morphogenetic flow is a global response to local forcing which arises from the spatial modulation of myosin density and anisotropy . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is derived from the spatial patterns of developmental transcription factors , but we suggest may also involve mechanical feedback affecting recruitment of myosin . </S>",
