    "for a fixed stellar component , decreasing @xmath36 increases the total mass of the halo ( @xmath39 ) , which raises the rotation curve .",
    "increasing the concentration of the initial halo packs more of the dark matter into the inner regions of the system , which also raises the inner rotation curve .",
    "in other words , changing either parameter affects the amount of mass contained within a few effective radii of the galaxy .",

    "star+halo models predict that a central or `` odd '' image should be detectable in more than 30% of lenses , but such images are rarely observed .",
    "equivalently , the upper limits on the fluxes of odd images for class lenses lead to strong lower limits on the central densities of lens galaxies , and star+halo models fail to satisfy the limits .",
    "the failure is perhaps not surprising , because odd images are sensitive to the mass distribution on scales of tens of parsecs , where simple cdm models may break down .",
    "for example , supermassive black holes , which appear to be common in the centers of galaxies ( e.g. , magorrian et al .  1998 ; gebhardt et al .  2000a , 2000b",

    "bulge mass correlation by more than a factor of 10 in order to suppress odd images at the required level .",
    "alternatively , steeper central cusps could suppress odd images , but only if mass cusps are considerable steeper than luminosity cusps , only if steep cusps can survive merger events ( which is unlikely if the progenitors contain black holes ; milosavljevi & merritt 2001 ) , and only at the expense of aggravating the discrepancy in the number and sizes of lenses .",
    "the evidence from the number and sizes of lenses ( and from spiral galaxy dynamics ) implies , then , that cdm mass distributions have too much mass on kiloparsec scales ; and the odd image problem indicates too little mass on tens of parsec scales",

    "allowing dark matter self - interactions can lower the density on large scales ( e.g. , spergel & steinhardt 2000 ; burkert 2000 ; dav et al .",

    "as an intriguing corollary , ostriker ( 2000 ) proposes that self - interactions could also increase the dark matter density on very small scales .",
    "self - interacting dark matter models might therefore provide a way to reconcile cosmological mass models with real galaxies over a wide range of spatial scales , although the details remain to be worked out .",
    "in any case , it appears that lensing will be a very important test of modifications to cdm through its ability to simultaneously test mass distributions on large scales ( via observed images ) and small scales ( via limits on , and eventually detections of , odd images ) .",
    "these tests based on galaxy - scale lenses will complement constraints on self - interacting dark matter from giant arcs produced by cluster lenses ( meneghetti et al.2001 ) .",

    "using two independent components would make it possible to to examine whether the stellar and halo distributions have similar or different ellipticities and orientations , although the decomposition may not be unique .",
    "finally , using two components with different ellipticities and/or orientations would test whether single - component lens models are sufficient or oversimplified .",
    "in particular , star+halo models might provide an internal reason why most lenses can not be fit by a single ellipsoidal mass distribution ( e.g. , keeton , kochanek & seljak 1997 ) , although internal effects may often be smaller than external tidal perturbations from objects near the lens galaxy or along the line of sight ( e.g. , hogg & blandford 1994 ; schechter et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the constraints on dark matter from lens statistics can be strengthened with better data in at least three ways .",
    "first , the strongest constraints come from the distribution of image separations , where the model predictions are sensitive to the redshift distribution of the class sample . the class spectroscopic subsample ( marlow et al.2000 ) provides a useful starting point , but the redshift distribution of the full sample must be better constrained to make the lensing analysis truly robust .",
    "second , many of the current constraints on odd images lie at the @xmath159 level ( rusin & ma 2001 ) . if the limits could be improved to the @xmath160 level or better , they would make the models much more sensitive to supermassive black holes , and lensing would become a powerful probe of black holes in distant galaxies out to redshift @xmath104 .",
    "finally , this analysis is based primarily on the sample of lenses from the class survey , which is the largest existing lens survey but still has only 18 lenses .",
    "larger surveys , in particular the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , should increase the number of lenses by well over an order of magnitude .",

    "<S> using the number and sizes of observed gravitational lenses , i derive upper limits on the dark matter content of elliptical galaxies . on average , dark matter can account for no more than 33% of the total mass within one effective radius ( @xmath0 ) of elliptical galaxies , or 40% of the mass within @xmath1 ( 95% confidence upper limits ) . </S>",
    "<S> i show that galaxies built from cold dark matter ( cdm ) mass distributions are too concentrated to comfortably satisfy these limits ; a high - density ( @xmath2 ) cdm cosmology is ruled out at better than 95% confidence , while a low - density , flat cosmology is only marginally consistent with the lens data </S>",
    "<S> . thus , lensing adds to the evidence from spiral galaxy dynamics that cdm mass distributions are too concentrated on kiloparsec scales to agree with real galaxies , and extends the argument to elliptical galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> lensing also provides a unique probe of the very inner regions of galaxies , because images are predicted to form near the centers of lens galaxies but are not observed . the lack of central images in deep maps of radio lenses places strong lower limits on the central densities of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the central densities of cdm galaxies are _ too low _ on @xmath310 parsec scales . </S>",

    "<S> bulge mass correlation in order to satisfy current limits on central images . </S>",
    "<S> self - interacting dark matter , or any other modification to regular cold dark matter , must simultaneously reduce the densities on kiloparsec scales and increase the densities on parsec scales in order to satisfy the unique constraints from lensing . </S>"
