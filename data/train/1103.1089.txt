    "the statistical mechanics of embedded two dimensional surfaces , or membranes , is a complex and fascinating topic that spans different areas of theoretical physics . in fact",
    ", embedded surfaces can be interpreted both as the world - sheet of fundamental strings or , more realistically , as describing chemically or biologically realized thermally fluctuating two dimensional membranes . in the latter case ,",
    "real world membranes fall in two different classes : those with fixed connectivity are usually called _ crystalline membranes _ , while those which are not are termed _ fluid membranes_. an effective action describing this second class of membranes has been proposed a long time ago , @xcite and is characterized by reparametrization invariance under coordinate changes .",
    "we describe a surface as a function @xmath8 which maps the point @xmath9 , @xmath10 , in a coordinate patch to the embedding function @xmath11 . at every point on the surface",
    ", we define tangent vectors @xmath12 and @xmath13 normal unit vectors @xmath14 , @xmath15 . using the induced metric tensor @xmath16",
    "we can calculate the area of the surface @xmath17 which is also the simplest reparametrization invariant we can construct . to every normal direction we associate an extrinsic curvature tensor defined by @xmath18 .",
    "since the extrinsic curvature tensors are symmetric they can be diagonalized at every point on the surface .",
    "this defines two principal curvatures @xmath19 for every normal direction .",
    "the following two reparametrization invariants are thus defined at each point ( all surface indices are raised using @xmath20 ) : @xmath21 where we also defined the traces @xmath22 .",
    "the invariants in ( [ a_1 ] ) are called , respectively , gaussian and mean curvature .",
    "the starting point of all modern differential geometry was the observation made by gauss , in his celebrated _ theorema egregium _",
    ", that the gaussian curvature is intrinsic , i.e. it does not depend on how the surface is embedded .",
    "gauss obtained the following relation between the extrinsic curvature tensors and the ( intrinsic ) riemann curvature tensor : @xmath23 from ( [ a_5 ] ) we easily obtain the relation @xmath24 , showing that the gaussian curvature is proportional to the ( intrinsic ) ricci scalar . also , since we are working with two dimensional surfaces , the riemann tensor and the ricci tensors are proportional to the ricci scalar .",
    "up to canonically irrelevant terms , we can consider the following microscopic action describing fluid membranes @xcite : @xmath25=\\int d^{2}x\\sqrt{g}\\left\\ { \\mu+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}k^{2}+\\frac{\\bar{\\kappa}}{2}r\\right\\ } \\,.\\label{1}\\ ] ] here @xmath26 is the surface tension , which has dimensions of a squared mass , @xmath27 is the bending rigidity while @xmath28 is termed gaussian rigidity .",
    "finally we recall that the integral over the whole surface of the ricci scalar is the euler characteristic of the surface @xmath29 , thus we expect the coupling @xmath28 to be relevant only when we allow topology fluctuations .",
    "an action of the sort of ( [ 1 ] ) is also interesting from a string theory point of view since the couplings @xmath27 is a relevant extension of the nambu - goto action , represented here by the first term in ( [ 1 ] ) , and has been considered in @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the rg flow of the couplings appearing in ( [ 1 ] ) by functional rg group methods based on the effective average action @xcite . to preserve invariance under reparametrizations ,",
    "the effective average action is constructed using the background field method .",
    "we employ heat kernel techniques to extract the beta functions for the running couplings @xmath30 @xmath2 and @xmath3 , defined later in ( [ f_1 ] ) , for arbitrary embedding dimension @xmath0 . for @xmath31",
    "the rg flow represents the phase diagram of fluid membranes at equilibrium and we can use these beta functions to search for non - trivial fixed points of the flow representing a possible crumpling transition at finite temperature , where fluid membranes undergo a transition between a flat phase and a totally crumpled one .",
    "this crumpling transition has been studied within the effective average action approach in @xcite .",
    "finally we advance the proposal to identify the @xmath5 limit of the theory with two dimensional quantum gravity , giving in this way a novel and original construction of it .",
    "we show how to interpret the idea that , for vanishing embedding dimension , only intrinsic fluctuations of the membrane contribute effectively to the path integral .",
    "in particular , we find that the flow of the extrinsic coupling vanish , showing that extrinsic degrees of freedom freeze , while the intrinsic coupling constants can be identified with the running cosmological and newton s constants .",
    "we then compare these new beta functions with those derived employing the effective average action formalism directly to the purely intrinsic theory of quantum gravity as first done in @xcite .",
    "the effective average action is a scale dependent generalization of the standard effective action that depends on an infrared scale @xmath32 and that interpolates smoothly between the microscopic action for @xmath33 and the effective action for @xmath34 .",
    "when local symmetries are present , as here reparametrization invariance , the effective average action is constructed employing the background field method .    under an infinitesimal reparametrization",
    "@xmath35 the embedding function @xmath11 transforms as:@xmath36 while the microscopic action ( [ 1 ] ) remains invariant .",
    "we parametrize fluctuations around a background configuration @xmath37 in the following way:@xmath38 on which we impose the background gauge - fixing condition @xmath39 , with@xmath40=\\delta\\mathbf{r}\\cdot\\partial_{\\alpha}\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}\\,.\\label{eaa_0.2}\\ ] ] the gauge - fixing condition ( [ eaa_0.2 ] ) allows fluctuations only in the normal directions .",

    "we will enforce the background gauge - fixing condition ( [ eaa_0.2 ] ) without exponentiation of the delta functional @xmath42 $ ] , i.e. we will integrate only over normal fluctuations .",
    "we can thus set@xmath43 by introducing @xmath13 fluctuation scalar fields @xmath44 .    to construct the effective average action we choose the cutoff action as follows : @xmath45=\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^{2}x\\sqrt{\\bar{g}}\\nu^{i}r_{k}(\\bar{\\delta})\\nu^{i}\\,.\\label{eaa_1}\\ ] ] here",
    "@xmath46 is the cutoff shape function and we defined @xmath47 .",
    "remember that the background metric @xmath48 used in ( [ eaa_1 ] ) is constructed employing the background field @xmath37 , thus the action ( [ eaa_1 ] ) is quadratic in the fluctuation fields .",
    "the effective average action can be defined implicitly by the following functional integral : @xmath49}=\\int d\\chi\\,\\exp\\left\\ { -s_{k}[\\chi+\\left\\langle \\nu\\right\\rangle ; \\bar{\\mathbf{r}}]-\\delta s_{k}[\\chi;\\bar{\\mathbf{r}}]+\\int d^{2}x\\sqrt{\\bar{g}}\\,\\gamma_{k}^{(1;0)}[\\left\\langle \\nu\\right\\rangle ; \\bar{\\mathbf{r}}]\\chi\\right\\ } \\,,\\label{eaa_2}\\ ] ] where @xmath50 .",

    "the main virtue of the effective average action is that it satisfies an exact rg flow equation .",
    "this can be derived by taking a scale derivative of ( [ eaa_2 ] ) with respect to the `` rg time '' @xmath54 and reads:@xmath55=\\frac{1}{2}\\textrm{tr}\\frac{\\partial_{t}r_{k}(\\bar{\\delta})}{\\gamma_{k}^{(2;0)}[\\left\\langle \\nu\\right\\rangle ; \\bar{\\mathbf{r}}]+r_{k}(\\bar{\\delta})}\\,.\\label{eaa_4}\\ ] ] from ( [ eaa_4 ] ) we immediately obtain the exact flow equation for the reparametrization invariant effective average action defined in ( [ eaa_3]):@xmath56=\\frac{1}{2}\\textrm{tr}\\frac{\\partial_{t}r_{k}(\\delta)}{\\gamma_{k}^{(2;0)}[0;\\mathbf{r}]+r_{k}(\\delta)}\\,.\\label{eaa_5}\\ ] ] note that the rg flow equation ( [ eaa_5 ] ) involves the hessian of the full functional @xmath57 $ ] evaluated at @xmath52 .",

    "we will make a truncation ansatz for @xmath51 $ ] where we will have @xmath58=\\bar{\\gamma}_{k}^{(2)}[\\mathbf{r}]$ ] and in this way we will be able to use ( [ eaa_5 ] ) .",
    "note also that in principle a scale dependent wave function renormalization factor @xmath59 for the fluctuation fields @xmath44 should be present in the cutoff action ( [ eaa_1 ] ) .",
    "this generates in the denominator of the rhs of the flow equations ( [ eaa_4 ] ) and ( [ eaa_5 ] ) a term of the form @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the anomalous dimension of the fluctuation fields .",
    "this contribution represents an rg improvement that reflects the fact the rg flow lives in the enlarged theory space where the full functional @xmath57 $ ] lives . for details on this point",
    "see @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will drop this term , i.e we fix @xmath62 .",
    "in this paper we consider the following ansatz for the effective average action , which is a scale dependent version of ( [ 1]):@xmath53=\\int d^{2}x\\sqrt{g}\\left\\ { \\mu_{k}+\\frac{\\kappa_{k}}{2}k^{2}+\\frac{\\bar{\\kappa}_{k}}{2}r\\right\\ } \\,.\\label{f_1}\\ ] ] here @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 are respectively the running surface tension , the running bending rigidity and the running gaussian rigidity . the first thing to do to evaluate the rhs of the flow equation ( [ eaa_5 ] )",

    "the system for @xmath81 and @xmath82 can thus be solved independently .    to look for crumpling transition , where the membrane undergoes a continuos transition between a flat phase and a totally crumpled one , we need to search for non - trivial fixed points of the beta function system ( [ f_14 ] ) .",
    "we can start by setting @xmath83 in ( [ f_14 ] ) obtaining the simple expressions : @xmath84 it can be shown , using the general properties that any admissible cutoff shape function must satisfy , that the coefficients in ( [ f_15 ] ) are scheme independent , i.e. they do not depend on the explicit form of @xmath46 . since our truncation contains only those couplings already present at the level of the microscopic action ( [ 1 ] ) and since we set the anomalous dimension of the fluctuation fields to zero , the beta functions ( [ f_15 ] ) reproduce those derived using perturbation theory @xcite .",

    "we arrive at the same conclusion if we study the flow in the @xmath88 plane .",
    "in particular we find no non - trivial fixed point for @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude that there is no evidence for a crumpling transition at @xmath4 , at least within the truncation ansatz we are considering .    on the side of numerical simulations",
    "there are in the literature both results in favor of a crumpling transition at finite temperature @xcite and in contrast @xcite .",
    "one possible source for this disagreement is the fact that different lattice versions of ( [ 1 ] ) are employed by these authors @xcite .",
    "our results are in agreement with the findings of @xcite .",
    "two dimensional quantum gravity can be formulated as a sum over equivalence classes of metrics on abstract two dimensional manifolds .",
    "the intrinsic metric represents the degree of freedom over which we integrate when performing the path integral and the action is constructed with intrinsic invariants built from it .",
    "polyakov was the first to show @xcite that by minimally coupling @xmath0 scalar fields to two dimensional quantum gravity , we obtain a description of the dynamics of two dimensional membranes propagating ( or fluctuating ) in a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space . in this setting",
    "it is easy to see that pure two dimensional quantum gravity should correspond to the theory of fluctuating membranes in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "since in recent years the rg flow of quantum gravity in arbitrary dimensions has been extensively studied using the effective average action approach @xcite , we can try to compare these `` intrinsic '' beta functions with the analytical continuation to @xmath5 of the beta functions we derived in the previous section .",
    "in other words we explore the idea if it is possible to construct two dimensional quantum gravity as the @xmath5 limit of the statistical mechanics of two dimensional membranes embedded in @xmath89 .",
    "we stress that while in the intrinsic formulation the limit @xmath5 just implies matter contributions to vanish , in the case of embedded membranes the limit @xmath5 is purely formal and should be considered as an analytical continuation to be applied to universal quantities such as critical exponents .",
    "to test this idea we will consider the beta function system ( [ f_14 ] ) in the limit @xmath5 together with the following identifications : @xmath90 where @xmath91 and @xmath92 are , respectively , the dimensionless cosmological and newton s constants . we then compare this new rg flow for two dimensional quantum gravity with the one obtained in @xcite .",
    "the first thing to note is that in ( [ f_14 ] ) the beta function of the extrinsic coupling @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath0 and thus vanishes in the @xmath5 limit .",

    "our beta function ( [ qg_3 ] ) accounts only for the ghost sector ! in the calculation that we presented in this paper",

    "differently , in the intrinsic calculation @xcite one works in @xmath104-dimensions , where the hessian of @xmath64 is a well defined second - order differential operator , and only at the level of the beta functions one takes the limit @xmath99 , in this way obtaining ( [ qg_4 ] ) .",
    "our result shows that the @xmath104-dimensional contribution to the beta function of newton s constant , when induced by a truncation containing @xmath64 , is not continuous in the limit @xmath99 .",
    "in fact , for @xmath105 the inverse hessian of @xmath64 has a pole @xmath106 which , in the effective average action calculation @xcite , is cured by an appropriate choice of the tensor structure of the cutoff action .",

    ", one can ask at what value we should fix the parameter @xmath94 . note that , if we set @xmath107 , the limit @xmath108 of the beta function of the dimensionless cosmological constant in ( [ qg_1 ] ) will diverge and so even the existence of the gaussian fixed point will be compromised . on the other side , to set @xmath107 in our truncation ansatz ( [ f_1 ] )",

    "note that all the rg flow trajectories that start with a positive @xmath91 approach the gaussian fixed point by passing trough values of negative dimensionless cosmological constant .",
    "the same happens in the intrinsic case @xcite . a nice property of the system ( [ qg_1 ] )",
    "is that we are always able to continue the flow towards the ir without encountering any singularity , a problem that is instead present in the intrinsic counterpart of ( [ qg_1 ] ) .",
    "one can argue that if we were considering @xmath101 membranes , then the beta function for the ( dimensionless ) bending rigidity in ( [ f_14 ] ) , in the limit @xmath5 , will be of the form @xmath111 implying that the ( dimensionless ) bending rigidity flows towards infinity in the ir . in view of this consideration",
    "we can consider the beta functions ( [ qg_1 ] ) in the limit @xmath112 .",
    "we recover again ( [ qg_3 ] ) for the beta function of newton s constant and we find the following form for the beta function of the dimensionless cosmological constant:@xmath113 the nice thing about the system composed of ( [ qg_3 ] ) and ( [ qg_4.1 ] ) is that flow trajectories with @xmath114 are present , feature that we said is not present in the intrinsic case .    the results of this section show that only the ghost contribution to the gravitational rg flow is continuous in the variable @xmath104 while the graviton contribution based on @xmath64 is not and is strictly zero in @xmath103 .",
    "we also understand that the role that in the intrinsic calculations is played by the ghost sector , in the extrinsic calculations is played by the extrinsic fluctuations , i.e. by those invariants in the effective average action which are constructed using the extrinsic curvature tensors @xmath115 .",

    "these results are very interesting and surprising if one considers that the standard intrinsic formulation of two dimensional quantum gravity and the extrinsic formulation that we proposed in this paper differ in several respects : in the degrees of freedom one uses to describe the system ( i.e. @xmath65 versus @xmath116 ) , in the kind of gauge - fixing condition one employs , in the structure of the ghost sector and in the order of the differential operators involved . still we find exact numerical agreement .",
    "this can be considered an indication that the limit @xmath5 `` exists '' .    finally , we speculate that if we were able to treat also the finite terms arising on the rhs of the flow equation ( [ f_4.01 ] ) , along the lines of what was done in @xcite , then in the @xmath5 limit we should find that the effective average action will flow to the non - local polyakov action proper to the ghost system of two dimensional quantum gravity",
    ". the other dynamical degree of freedom of two dimensional quantum gravity is the conformal factor , but the truncation ansatz ( [ f_1 ] ) gives no kinetic term to it .",
    "an obvious candidate for this role is the non - local polyakov action , but the treatment of a truncation including this term is still difficult to handle within the effective average action approach .",
    "we have constructed the effective average action for two dimensional fluid membranes embedded in a @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space .",
    "we used the background field method to preserve reparametrization invariance of the theory and we derived the exact flow equation for this class of theories .",
    "we computed the beta functions for the running surface tension , bending rigidity and gaussian rigidity for any value of @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath31 we found no evidence for a non - trivial fixed point , thus confirming the expectation that fluid membranes are always in the crumpled phase @xcite .",
    "it must be remembered that real world membranes are typically characterized by self - avoiding interactions that penalize self - intersections of the membrane .",
    "it is thus important to consider the effect of these non - local interactions on the phase diagram of the model @xcite .",
    "the effective average action is probably one of the few analytical formalisms where one can embark on the task of treating such interactions analytically .",
    "this paper has to be seen as a first step in this direction .",
    "since two dimensional quantum gravity , when minimally coupled to @xmath0 scalar fields , is equivalent to the theory of propagating membranes in @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space , we proposed to identify two dimensional quantum gravity as the @xmath5 limit of the statistical mechanics of ( fluid ) membranes embedded in @xmath89 .",
    "we tested this idea by considering this explicit limit in the beta functions that we derived .",
    "we found first that the extrinsic coupling ( the bending rigidity ) freezes , thus becoming a free parameter in the beta functions of the dimensionless cosmological and newton s constants .",
    "more importantly , in the @xmath108 limit , the beta function of @xmath92 becomes scheme independent and we obtain quantitative agreement with the corresponding beta function derived in the intrinsic approach to two dimensional quantum gravity . more precisely we found that we reproduced solely the ghost contributions .",
    "the graviton contribution is strictly zero in @xmath103 and not continuous in the @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) limit since the operator @xmath64 is a topological invariant in @xmath103 .",
    "these results are an indication of the equivalence between ( intrinsic ) two dimensional quantum gravity and the statistical mechanics of fluctuating embedded surfaces in the @xmath5 .",
    "the intuitive idea behind this is that embedded membranes have both intrinsic and extrinsic fluctuations and that these last can be `` factored out '' by eliminating the embedding space through the @xmath5 limit .",
    "one expects to be able to calculate universal properties of two dimensional quantum gravity by this reformulation .",
    "it is tempting now to extend this conjecture to higher dimensions : can we see @xmath104-dimensional quantum gravity as the @xmath5 limit of the statistical mechanics of @xmath104-dimensional membranes embedded in a @xmath0-dimensional manifold ( not necessarily @xmath89 ) ?",
    "this will be particularly interesting in @xmath117 where intrinsic calculations point in the direction that quantum gravity may be asymptotically safe @xcite , i.e. that the rg group flow for this theory may have an uv attractive non - trivial fixed point .",
    "also , this reformulation can shade light on the role played by the background metric in the effective average action formulation of intrinsic @xmath104-dimensional quantum gravity @xcite since no background gauge - fixing and no background ghost actions are present at the level of the bare action .",
    "all this will be the subject of future work @xcite .",
    "we would like to thank r. percacci for careful reading the manuscript and for useful and stimulating discussions .",
    "the research of o.z . is supported by the deutsche forschungsgemein - schaft ( dfg ) within the emmy - noether program ( grant no .",
    "sa/1975 1 - 1 ) .",
    "to find the explicit expression for the beta functions ( [ f_12 ] ) we need to evaluate the @xmath72-functionals .",
    "these are defined as follows:@xmath118=\\frac{1}{\\gamma(n)}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}dz\\ , z^{n-1}f(z)\\,,\\label{c_1}\\ ] ] for @xmath119 and @xmath118=(-1)^{n}f^{(n)}(0)\\,,\\label{c_2}\\ ] ] for @xmath120 .",
