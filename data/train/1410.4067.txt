    "as an archetype of open quantum systems , the spin - boson model @xcite finds a wide range of applications in condensed phase physics and physical chemistry in topics such as quantum computation @xcite , spin dynamics @xcite , biological molecules @xcite and quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model consists of a two - level system coupled linearly to an environment bath represented by a set of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the coupling between the system and the environment can be characterized by a spectral function @xmath2 , which usually adopts a power law form in the low frequency regime @xmath3 .",
    "depending on the value of @xmath4 , there exist three distinct cases known as sub - ohmic ( @xmath5 ) , ohmic ( @xmath6 ) and super - ohmic ( @xmath7 ) regimes .",
    "an interesting aspect of the spin - boson model concerns the quantum phase transition in the ground state .",
    "recent theoretical studies @xcite show that there is a second - order phase transition separating a non - degenerate delocalized phase from a doubly degenerate localized phase due to the competition between the tunneling and the environment induced dissipation in the sub - ohmic regime .",
    "it is also well known that there exists a kosterlitz - thouless type phase transition in the ohmic regime @xcite .",
    "the spin - boson model is similar to a one - exciton , two - site version of the holstein model @xcite widely used to study optical and transport properties of organic and biological molecules . in the holstein model ,",
    "the diagonal and off - diagonal exciton - phonon coupling are defined as non - trivial dependence of the exciton site energies and transfer integrals on the phonon coordinates , respectively @xcite .",
    "similarly , the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling in the spin - boson model denote bath - induced modulation of the spin bias and tunneling , respectively .",
    "most studies on the quantum phase transition of the spin - boson model consider the coupling in the diagonal form , predominantly because identifying the quantum phase transition of the spin - boson model with simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal coupling is a challenging problem from the theoretical point of view .",
    "recent studies @xcite utilized the davydov @xmath0 variational ansatz to investigate the quantum phase transition of the spin - boson model in the sub - ohmic regime with the spin coupled diagonally and off - diagonally to a common bath .",
    "it is revealed that the off - diagonal coupling lifts the degeneracy in the localized phase , thereby removing the second - order phase transition .",
    "the interplay between the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling is thus known to give rise to a much richer phase diagram .    to obtain a deeper insight into the competition between the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling , an additional phonon bath coupled to the spin",
    "off - diagonally can be taken into account , resulting in a two - bath spin - boson model ( see fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] ) .",
    "this two - bath model is an appropriate low - energy description of a variety of physical systems , such as the excitonic energy transfer process in natural and artificial light - harvesting systems @xcite , electromagnetic fluctuations of two linear circuits attached to a superconducting qubit @xcite , two cavity fields coupled to a squid - based charge qubit @xcite , and the process of thermal transport between two reservoirs coupled with a molecular junction @xcite . in the case of zero bias and tunneling , the model exhibits a high level of symmetry , which can be described by a non - trivial central extension of the abelian symmetry group .",
    "the group theory analysis shows that the system s ground state is always doubly degenerate , and rendering invalid the picture of phase transition from degenerate to non - degenerate ground states . in other words , the ground state degeneracy does not necessarily support the spontaneous magnetization .",
    "moreover , the quantum - to - classical correspondence fails in dealing with the two - bath model due to the sign problem @xcite .",
    "hence , it remains very challenging to understand the quantum phase transition of the two - bath model .",
    "+    previous numerical studies on the spin - boson model are typically based on the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) @xcite , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) @xcite , the method of sparse polynomial space representation @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , the extended coherence state approach @xcite and the variational approach @xcite .",
    "the results point to a second - order phase transition which is ascribed to the competition between the diagonal spin - bath coupling and the spin tunneling .",
    "apart from the spin tunneling , the off - diagonal spin - bath coupling in the two - bath model can also provide a communication channel between spin - up and spin - down states .",
    "it is thus interesting to investigate whether the quantum phase transition of the two - bath model retains its second order characteristics .",
    "motivated by these considerations , in this paper we aim to investigate the quantum phase transition of two - bath model in the simultaneous presence of the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling . by using the variational approach , dmrg and exact diagonalization as well as symmetry and mean - field analyses , we conduct a comprehensive study on the ground state properties of two - bath model , identify the picture of quantum phase transition and accurately determine transition points in the sub - ohmic regime . a first - order quantum phase transition between the localized and delocalized states",
    "is inferred , and an effective spatial dimensional @xmath8 is estimated , consistent with the mean - field prediction .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the two - bath model is described , and the analyses based on symmetry and mean field are performed . in sec .",
    "iii and iv , the numerical results are presented for the quantum phase transition of the two bath model coupled to the baths described by the single mode and continuous spectral density function , respectively . finally , the discussion and conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "the standard hamiltonian of the spin - boson model can be written as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is spin bias , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are pauli matrices , @xmath13 is the tunneling constant , @xmath14 denotes the frequency of the @xmath15-th effective bath mode for which @xmath16(@xmath17 ) represnts the phonon annihilation ( creation ) operator , and @xmath18 signifies the coupling amplitude with the spin .",
    "the spectral density function is @xmath19 generally , it is convenient to rewrite eq .",
    "( [ sbm1_h ] ) into its continuous form @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the continuous @xmath23 and @xmath24 , @xmath25 is the dispersion relation , and @xmath26 is the coupling function . as indicated in refs . @xcite and @xcite , @xmath25 and @xmath26 obey @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the inverse function of @xmath25 .",
    "a logarithmic discretization procedure is adopted by dividing the phonon frequency interval @xmath29 $ ] into @xmath30 intervals @xmath31\\omega_c$ ] ( @xmath32 and choosing @xmath33 as constant in each interval @xcite . where @xmath30 is the number of effective bath modes , and @xmath34 is the maximum frequency in the bath . then , the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath18 in eq .",
    "( [ sbm1_h ] ) can be obtained by @xmath35 note that infinite bath modes are considered via the integration of the continuous spectral density @xmath2 , although the number of effective bath modes @xmath30 is finite .    in this paper",
    ", we primarily aim to study the two - bath model , for which the hamiltonian is written as @xmath36 where the subscript @xmath37 is introduced to distinguish the two baths , and @xmath18 and @xmath38 are the diagonal and off - diagonal coupling amplitude , respectively , which determine spectral densities , @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are dimensionless coupling strengths , and the frequency cut off @xmath34 is set to be unity throughout this paper .",
    "the two boson baths are characterized by the spectral exponents @xmath4 and @xmath42 , accounting for the diagonal and off - diagonal , respectively .      for nonzero values of @xmath43 , and @xmath13 , the system hamiltonian does not possess any symmetry .",
    "therefore , in this work we assume that @xmath44 , and focus on the case of @xmath45 as it corresponds to scenarios with much stronger symmetry ( the case of @xmath46 can be reduced similarly by an obvious rotation ) .",
    "we introduce the notation @xmath47 and consider the operators @xmath48 that act in the system space of states , and obviously commute with the system hamiltonian when @xmath45 . taking the product of the above , we obtain @xmath49 where @xmath50 clearly obey a product rule .",
    "a straightforward verification shows that eight operators @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , form a non - abelian group @xmath53 , whose center ( i.e. , the set of elements that commute with any element of the group ) is represented by @xmath54 .",
    "we thus have the factor group @xmath55 that is an abelian group .",
    "stated differently , the non - abelian symmetry group @xmath53 of the two - bath model with zero bias and tunneling is given by a non - trivial central extension of the abelian group @xmath56 .",
    "the set of its unitary irreducible representations is given by four one - dimensional representations , characterized by the trivial action of the group center , and therefore labeled by four irreducible representations of the abelian group @xmath56 , characterized by a non - trivial action of the center , or more specifically the elements @xmath57 are represented by the operators @xmath58 .",
    "since by definition the operators @xmath57 act in the space of states as @xmath58 , only the two - dimensional representation participates in the decomposition of the space of states in irreducible representations .",
    "furthermore , by the schur lemma , all energy levels , in particular the ground state , are necessarily doubly degenerate .    in the @xmath59 case ,",
    "the symmetry is reduced to the abelian subgroup @xmath60 that consists of two elements @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 , and the quantum phase transition occurs between the phase with spontaneous magnetization in the @xmath63-direction , characterized by a double - degenerate ground state , and a symmetric phase with no spontaneous magnetization @xmath64 and non - degenerate ground state .",
    "the above picture is quite similar to the phase transition in the standard spin - boson model with one diagonally - coupled bath .",
    "the situation in the @xmath46 case is quite different .",
    "firstly , due to symmetry considerations presented above , the system ground state is always doubly degenerate , and the phase transition from degenerate to non - degenerate ground state disappears .",
    "secondly , one can , and should , consider spontaneous magnetization @xmath64 and @xmath65 in the @xmath63- and @xmath66-directions , respectively . in what follows",
    "we will first describe the symmetry - based picture of the phase transition in the @xmath46 case , and then give further support to the presented scenario with numerical simulations , based on the variational and dmrg approaches .",
    "we start with noting that , while non - degenerate ground state does not support spontaneous magnetization by mere symmetry arguments , either does the ground - state degeneracy necessarily .",
    "rather , the latter merely creates an opportunity for spontaneous magnetization to occur . indeed , to consider the dependence of spontaneous magnetization @xmath64 on bias @xmath10 , we switch on a very weak `` magnetic field , '' which in our case introduces a weak , yet non - zero bias @xmath10 . for a non - degenerate ground state we will have @xmath67 , which corresponds to finite susceptibility . in the case of degenerate ground state",
    "the additional term @xmath68 can eliminate the degeneracy , and we will obtain a finite value of @xmath64 for @xmath69 , given by the expectation value of the @xmath70 operator evaluated with respect to the non - degenerate ground state .",
    "therefore , to ascertain whether the symmetry is actually broken one needs to evaluate the projection of the @xmath70 or @xmath11 operator onto the two - dimensional subspace of the ground states . this can be done by invoking a convenient basis set of the eigenstates of @xmath71 or @xmath72 operator . since @xmath73",
    ", the eigenvalues would be @xmath74 .",
    "let @xmath75 ; then @xmath76 , so that our basis is given by @xmath77 . a straightforward computation yields @xmath78 and @xmath79 , as well as @xmath80 .",
    "@xmath81 and @xmath82 are also derived . denoting by @xmath83 and @xmath84 the operators , acting in the two - dimensional subspace of ground states , represented by the corresponding pauli matrices in the basis set",
    "as introduced above , we arrive at @xmath85 where @xmath86 denotes the projection onto the subspace of the ground states .",
    "it follows directly from eq .",
    "( [ sigma - project ] ) that the spontaneous magnetization @xmath87 can be expressed in terms of overlaps of properly chosen system states .",
    "this means that although due to the symmetry the system ground state is always doubly degenerate , the symmetry can be broken or independent of whether the corresponding overlap in eq .",
    "( [ magnetization - overlap ] ) vanishes or not .",
    "we are now in a position to lay out a picture of the phase transition , which will be verified by numerical simulations to come .",
    "for @xmath45 there is a phase transition that for given @xmath40 occurs at @xmath88 , so that for @xmath89 the system is in a phase with @xmath90 and @xmath91 , whereas for @xmath92 , the opposite trend ensues .",
    "this implies that one of the spontaneous magnetizations is always non - zero while the other necessarily vanishes .",
    "the two - bath model can be treated using an approach presented in appendix  a for the case of the standard spin - boson model counterpart . in this subsection",
    ", we present an alternate , completely equivalent approach to study two - bath model , in order to emphasize its connection with the theory of stochastic processes and the probability theory .",
    "consider a gaussian stochastic process for periodic @xmath93 trajectories @xmath94 with the probability measure @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined as a differential in the path integral , and the time - ordered matsubara green functions of the spin operators adopt a form @xmath97 in the equation above , we have denoted @xmath98 the partition function is given as @xmath99 and the form of the effective action is @xmath100 note that eq .",
    "( [ spin - corr - stoch ] ) provides formal expressions for the matsubara spin correlation functions in terms of stochastic averaging . in the most interesting case of @xmath101 ,",
    "( [ define - u ] ) adopts a form @xmath102    the above representation for the spin correlation functions , including the partition function , is readily obtained by introducing the collective coordinates @xmath103 and @xmath104 , associated with the two uncorrelated baths , which fully describe the spin - bath coupling .",
    "further , we note that the spin correlation functions in our quantum system are fully determined by the two - point correlation functions of the collective coordinates .",
    "these functions can thus be reproduced by a gaussian stochastic model with the spin coupled to the stochastic variable @xmath105 , provided the two - point correlation functions of the stochastic variables coincide with the quantum correlation functions of the corresponding collective - coordinate variables .",
    "the latter condition is satisfied if ( and only if ) the functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 satisfy eq .",
    "( [ k ] ) .    to obtain the mean - field picture of the phase transition",
    ", we consider the value of the effective action for @xmath108 independent of @xmath109 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath110 where the contribution of the lower eigenvalue is neglected in the calculation of @xmath111 .",
    "minimizing the effective energy with respect to @xmath108 , we obtain @xmath112 this will lead to a phase transition ( on the mean field level of theory ) at @xmath113 . in each of the two phases , we have non - zero spontaneous magnetization in one direction , whereas there is no spontaneous magnetization in the other .",
    "moreover , at the mean field level of theory , the phase transition is of first order , since there is spontaneous magnetization at the phase transition point .",
    "note that at the phase transition point the system has higher @xmath114 symmetry , at least on the mean - field level .",
    "as we know in systems with local interactions , strong transverse fluctuations destroy spontaneous magnetization for the space dimension @xmath115 .",
    "although our model is one - dimensional , the nonlocal nature of interactions gives rise to an effective dimension that depends on the parameter @xmath4 and should be identified by considering the properties of long - range fluctuations around the mean - field solution . in what follows",
    "we argue that according to the aforementioned criterion , we have @xmath116 , so that the critical value of @xmath4 is @xmath117 , i.e. , for @xmath118 and @xmath119 the phase transition is first- and second - order , respectively .",
    "we first explore the ground state properties of a spin coupled to two single - mode baths using exact diagonalization .",
    "the corresponding hamiltonian can be written as @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are diagonal and off - diagonal coupling constants , respectively . for convenience , we assume @xmath123 and @xmath124 are the bosonic states corresponding to the spin up and down states , which can be expanded in a series of fock states @xmath125|0\\rangle$ ] as follows @xmath126 are the coefficients with respect to a series of @xmath127 for the two bosonic baths with diagonal and off - diagonal coupling , respectively , and @xmath128 is the bosonic truncated number defined as a cutoff value of the phonon occupation number . in this work ,",

    "<S> by employing the variational approach , density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) , exact diagonalization as well as symmetry and mean - field analyses , the ground state properties of the two - bath spin boson model with simultaneous diagonal and off - diagonal coupling are systematically studied in the sub - ohmic regime . a novel quantum phase transition from a doubly </S>",
    "<S> degenerate `` localized phase '' to the other doubly degenerate `` delocalized phase '' is uncovered . via the multi-@xmath0 ansatz as the variational wave function , transition points are determined accurately , consistent with the results from dmrg and exact diagonalization . </S>",
    "<S> an effective spatial dimension @xmath1 is then estimated , which is found to be compatible with the mean - field prediction . furthermore , the quantum phase transition is inferred to be of first order for the baths described by a continuous spectral density function . in the case of single mode , however , the transition is softened . </S>"
