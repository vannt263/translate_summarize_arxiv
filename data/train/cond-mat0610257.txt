    "recently colloidal systems have been synthesised in which the effective pair potential between the colloidal particles is attractive just outside the core separation distance , but is repulsive for larger particle separations.@xcite the long range repulsion stems from the colloids being charged and the short range attraction is generated by the depletion mechanism,@xcite arising from the addition of non - adsorbing polymers to the solution.@xcite such competing interactions can give rise to phase behaviour that can be very different from that found in ` simple ' liquids . theory and simulation in both two and three dimensions for model systems with competing interactions predicts that such interactions can give rise to a state with undamped periodic density fluctuations , which indicates a transition to cluster or striped phases ( microphase separation).@xcite in the cluster phase the colloids are ordered in such a way that there are assemblies containing tens or hundreds of particles and large voids between the clusters , containing hardly any particles .",
    "similarly , in the striped phase in two dimensions the particles are arranged in parallel stripes with low density regions in - between the stripes.@xcite in three dimensions the stripes form a gel  like network of elongated clusters.@xcite this behaviour is most striking given that the pair interactions between the particles are spherically symmetrical and suggests that such systems could be important candidates for developing self - assembling pattern forming materials .",
    "the liquid - vapour phase transition may be preempted by a transition to a cluster or stripe phase , but if the long - range repulsion is not sufficiently strong , no permanent clusters or stripes are present , and a liquid - vapour phase transition is found .",
    "however , the liquid - gas coexistence curve is unusually flat in the critical region.@xcite    whilst the bulk phase behaviour has begun to be understood , there are no detailed studies of how the long - range decay of the pair correlation functions is affected by the competition between attraction and repulsion and very little is known about the properties of such fluids in inhomogeneous situations where the average fluid density is non - uniform . in the present paper we present a mean - field density functional theory ( dft ) for a simple model of such systems which provides a means of analysing correlation functions and a first step in elucidating the properties of inhomogeneous fluids composed of particles with competing interactions .",
    "the particular model fluid we consider in this paper is that described in refs .",
    ", in which particles interact via a double - yukawa pair potential of the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the inverse temperature ( we shall set @xmath5 ) , @xmath0 is the diameter of the particles and the amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 . for a fixed value of @xmath8 , the parameter @xmath9 plays a role somewhat akin to an inverse temperature . in the context of colloid - polymer mixtures one can envisage an athermal system at a fixed temperature and varying the chemical potential of a polymer reservoir thereby changing the strength of the depletion attraction . indeed , in the simple asakura - oosawa - vrij model , the depletion attraction between colloidal particles arising from the exclusion of ideal polymers , yields a well depth proportional to @xmath10 , the fugacity of the ideal polymers.@xcite following the spirit of this approach we can view our parameter @xmath9 as a measure of the polymer fugacity .",

    "here we make a systematic study of the asymptotic decay @xmath18 of @xmath16 in various regions of the phase diagram .",
    "the form of the decay of @xmath16 is determined by the poles of @xmath17 in the upper half of the complex @xmath19plane.@xcite we use a simple dft , equivalent to the random phase approximation ( rpa ) of the tail potential outside the hardcore for the bulk fluid , to elucidate the precise pole structure for particles interacting with pair potentials given by eq .",

    "the fluid displays a propensity to cluster formation which is manifest for some state points as a slowly decaying , long wavelength oscillatory decay of the radial distribution function @xmath16  the wavelength being related to the size of the clusters .",
    "of course , at sufficiently low densities the decay of @xmath16 is monotonic .",
    "we locate lines in the phase diagram at which the ultimate asymptotic decay of @xmath16 crosses over from monotonic to oscillatory .",
    "in addition we find , for some values of the fluid pair potential parameters , that there can be a crossover in the decay of @xmath16 from long wavelength oscillatory to oscillatory with wavelength @xmath20 .",
    "we find that the pole structure displayed by our simple ( rpa ) dft , and hence the crossover behaviour , is mimicked closely by the more accurate self consistent ornstein zernike approximation ( scoza),@xcite indicating that the simple dft describes , at least qualitatively , the main features of the fluid structure .    for sufficiently large values of @xmath8 we find that on increasing @xmath9 , the peak in the structure factor calculated from the dft can diverge at @xmath21 .",

    "the scoza amounts to setting:@xcite @xmath76 this closure differs from the rpa considered in sec .  [ sec : dft ] in two respects : first , the core condition on the radial distribution function is satisfied .",
    "second , the amplitude @xmath77 of the direct correlation function outside the repulsive core has not been set to @xmath78 .",
    "rather @xmath77 is regarded as an unknown state - dependent quantity , to be determined in such a way that consistency between the compressibility and the energy route to thermodynamics is enforced .",
    "the previous applications of scoza , including the study of fluids with competing interactions,@xcite were aimed at thermal systems with a temperature - independent potential , such that the phase diagram can be plotted as a function of density and temperature . for thermal fluids , the consistency condition amounts to requiring that the reduced compressibility @xmath79 and the excess internal energy per unit volume @xmath80 satisfy the condition : @xmath81 where @xmath79 is obtained from the compressibility sum rule , i.e.  @xmath82 , while @xmath80 is obtained from the energy equation @xmath83 . if the closure  ( [ closure ] ) is implemented for the correlations , the consistency condition  ( [ consist ] ) yields a closed partial differential equation ( pde ) for the function @xmath84 .",
    "it should be noted that in the present case @xmath42 is in effect independent of temperature ( see eq .  ( [ eq : pair_pot ] ) ) , and the phase diagrams will be plotted as a function of @xmath61 , the inverse strength of the attractive tail potential .",
    "for such an athermal system , eq .",
    "( [ consist ] ) does not hold anymore , as a consequence of the trivial dependence on the temperature of the helmholtz free energy , @xmath85 .",
    "however , for any given @xmath9 , the value of @xmath86 of the athermal system is the same as that given by a temperature - independent interaction @xmath87 at a temperature @xmath88 , where @xmath42 is given in eq .",

    "( [ consist ] ) is valid .",
    "therefore , the phase diagram and the correlations of the original potential ( [ eq : pair_pot ] ) have been determined by integrating the scoza pde for @xmath90 down to the reduced temperature @xmath91 for each of the values of @xmath9 considered .",

    "( [ consist ] ) for the athermal system by replacing the inverse temperature @xmath92 with a coupling constant which varies from zero to unity , whose purpose is to switch on the tail interaction .    in the present case ,",
    "implementing the scoza scheme is made simpler by taking advantage of the analytical results  @xcite obtained for the mean spherical approximation ( msa ) when the tail potential has a two - yukawa form as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pair_pot ] ) .",
    "these enable one to obtain @xmath79 as a function of @xmath47 and @xmath80 .",

    "the resulting pde for @xmath80 supplemented with suitable initial and boundary conditions  @xcite is integrated numerically .",
    "integration of @xmath80 with respect to @xmath92 then yields the helmholtz free energy and hence all the other thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the scoza , like the rpa , yields a spinodal curve , i.e. , a locus in the temperature - density plane where the compressibility diverges .",
    "as soon as one enters the region bounded by the spinodal , @xmath79 is no longer positive , so that the theory ceases to be meaningful .",

    "the corresponding pressure can exhibit a van der waals loop and we calculate the coexisting gas and liquid densities in the standard way .",

    "we find quite good agreement between the two theories , although the dft being a mean field theory , is unable to describe correctly the shape of the coexistence curve in the region of the critical point .    within the present dft , having calculated the spinodal and binodal for a particular value of @xmath8 , one can obtain results for all other values of @xmath8 by a simple re  scaling of the vertical ( @xmath61 ) axis .",
    "it is straightforward to show that , within the dft , the critical density is independent of @xmath8 . for the case",
    "@xmath110 ( not displayed ) , the present theory yields a critical density within 5% of the value obtained from the more accurate scoza.@xcite however , as @xmath8 is increased the discrepancy increases .",
    "the general trend that the value of @xmath61 at the critical point is decreased as @xmath8 is increased is found in both theories.@xcite    in figs .",

    ", one should keep in mind that , unlike the rpa , there are regimes in which the theory can not be solved . in particular , this is the case for values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that the competition between attraction and repulsion is very strong , and the fluid is expected to form microphases . in the rpa , this regime is marked by the appearance of the @xmath1-line , where the structure factor @xmath17 has a singularity for @xmath111 .",
    "however , such a singularity is incompatible with the fulfilment of the core condition  ( [ closure ] ) if the direct correlation function in fourier space @xmath57 is analytic on the real axis , which is indeed the case in scoza . as a consequence",
    ", the scoza fails to have solutions before a divergence in @xmath17 occurs .",
    "because of the non - local character of the scoza pde , this lack of convergence involves the full range of density .",
    "therefore , is is not possible to locate the @xmath1-line using scoza . another constraint is related to the numerical integration procedure , which requires the scoza pde to be stable with respect to small fluctuations of the solution .",
    "however , such a requirement is not fulfilled when @xmath8 is sufficiently large that the repulsive tail contribution to the potential overwhelms the attractive one . in this case",
    ", the pde behaves like a diffusion equation with a negative diffusion coefficient , and can not be integrated numerically .",
    "an estimate of this intrinsic stability limit is provided by the condition that the spatial integral of the tail potential @xmath112 should remain negative . how the above constraints affect the existence of the solution in the present representation , in which the phase diagram is studied as a function of the attraction amplitude @xmath9 at fixed repulsion amplitude @xmath8 ,",
    "can be gleaned by considering the case @xmath60 reported in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] .",

    "for small values of @xmath8 the region of the phase diagram in which the decay of @xmath16 is long wavelength oscillatory is bounded above and below by two kirkwood lines ",
    "see figs .",

    "[ fig:5 ] and [ fig:6 ] ) , indicating a transition to a phase with undamped periodic density fluctuations ",
    "e.g.  a cluster or a stripe phase .",
    "note that the appearance of a region in the phase diagram with long wavelength oscillatory decay of correlation functions is not restricted to fluids with competing interactions .",
    "such behaviour is to be expected in any system with competing interactions.@xcite in ref .",
    "the authors investigate the form of the correlation functions in frustrated @xmath263 spin systems .",
    "they find that as the strength of the frustration parameter ( the analogue of the parameter @xmath8 in the present system ) is increased , a region in the phase diagram opens up in which the decay of spin - spin correlations is oscillatory , crossing over above and below to regions of monotonic decay , in much the same way as in the present fluid system .    in general ,",
    "the results of our simple mean field dft ( rpa ) are in good qualitative and sometimes quantitative agreement with the more sophisticated ( and more accurate ) scoza theory .",
    "this reflects the fact that our focus has been on state points where the parameters @xmath264 .",
    "recall that @xmath265 is the value of the pair potential at contact , @xmath43 , so that we have focused on cases where the portion of the pair potential that we treat in mean field fashion has an amplitude @xmath266 .",
    "we expect the present mean field dft to be less reliable when @xmath267 , or when the width of the attractive portion of the pair potential becomes narrow , i.e.  when @xmath13 becomes very large . in the present study we have , in the main , avoided these regimes ; an exception is the system described in fig .",
    "[ fig:8 ] where @xmath223 .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : inhom_profiles ] we presented results from dft for inhomogeneous one - body fluid density profiles .",
    "the oscillatory density profiles in figs .",
    "[ fig:10 ] and [ fig:11 ] correspond to state points between the kirkwood and the @xmath1-line in the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , where the system is a disordered fluid , albeit with a propensity towards cluster formation . for state points in the vicinity of the @xmath1-line we find some very striking density profiles with pronounced long wavelength ( @xmath2 ) oscillations .",
    "it is important to enquire whether such behaviour pertains beyond the mean - field ( mf ) treatment we present here .",
    "determining the existence or non - existence of a @xmath1-line is a problem that arises for other types of fluids , e.g.  microemulsions near the transition to a lamellar phase and smectic liquid crystals .",
    "recently much effort has focused on a possible @xmath1-transition for charge ordering in the restricted primitive model ( rpm ) in which the two species of ions are modelled by equal sized hard spheres carrying equal and opposite charges.@xcite it is well known that in the rpm the location of the @xmath1-line in the phase diagram depends sensitively on the choice of ( mf ) approximation  see ref .",
    "and references therein .",
    "for example , a simple dft yields a @xmath1-line of continuous transitions between a uniform disordered phase and a charge ordered phase , whereas the more sophisticated msa predicts no @xmath1-transition .",
    "for the former case ciach    et al    .",
    "@xcite studied correlation functions in some detail and found that on approaching the @xmath1-line , from the disordered side , both the decay length _ and _ the amplitude of the charge - charge pair correlation function diverge as @xmath268 , where @xmath269 measures the ` distance ' of the state point from the @xmath1-line .",
    "the derivation of ciach    et al    .    is based on a particular form for the ( charge - charge ) inverse correlation function . however , their results generalise straight forwardly@xcite to any fluid system where the dominant poles approach the real axis at @xmath270 and the other poles are well removed .",
    "as this situation pertains in the present dft ( rpa ) treatment of our model fluid we expect that close to the @xmath1-transition @xmath271 with @xmath272 and @xmath273 , where again @xmath269 measures the distance from the @xmath1-line .",
    "this result arises also in a simplified treatment based on the small-@xmath19 expansion of the direct correlation function : @xmath274 . for @xmath275 , @xmath276 , the condition that @xmath277 be positive definite for every @xmath278",
    "is violated for @xmath279 , @xmath280 and the appearance of the @xmath1-line corresponds to the marginal case @xmath281 . as the @xmath1-line",
    "is approached from the disordered side , one has @xmath279 , @xmath282 , which via contour integration , gives eq .",
    "( [ eq:28 ] ) with @xmath283 .",
    "clearly the mf treatment implies the unphysical result that pair correlations are unbounded on approaching the @xmath1-line .",
    "what occurs beyond mf theory ? for the rpm a field theoretic treatment,@xcite based on the approach of brazovskii,@xcite shows that incorporating fluctuations leads to the disappearance of the @xmath1-transition .",
    "rather a first order transition to a charge - ordered ( crystalline ) phase occurs at a temperature below that of the original mf @xmath1-transition .",
    "( note that the @xmath1-transition is absent in simulation studies of the continuum rpm . )",
    "moreover the charge - charge correlation function changes smoothly near the original mf @xmath1-transition ; the decay length and amplitude vary continuously.@xcite    one might infer that the very striking long - ranged decay of @xmath16 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig:2 ] for @xmath74 , at a state point rather close to the @xmath1-line in fig .",
    "[ fig:5 ] , is an artifact of the mf treatment since including fluctuation effects would remove the @xmath1-transition , replacing this with a first - order transition to some ordered state ( cluster or stripe phase , perhaps ) . for state points",
    "somewhat further from the @xmath1-line , such as @xmath284 , the long wavelength oscillations still develop in @xmath16 but these are more highly damped .",
    "nevertheless , the corresponding structure factor @xmath17 exhibits a pronounced peak at a non - zero wavenumber @xmath22  see fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "the fact that scoza yields a very similar structure factor gives us some confidence in the results of the mean field dft ( rpa ) for such state points . on the other hand , unlike the rpa , scoza does not yield a @xmath1-line , rather it fails to converge in the regime in which a @xmath1-line is expected according to the rpa .",
    "as the convergence limit is approached , the cluster peak in @xmath17 may reach values much larger than unity , but nevertheless the peak height does not grow arbitrarily , since a singularity in @xmath17 at nonvanishing @xmath19 is incompatible with the core condition eq .",
    "( [ closure ] ) , which is fulfilled in scoza .",
    "this can be regarded as an indication that the @xmath1-transition will be removed when one goes beyond the mf approximation .",
    "it is tempting to introduce a rough and ready criterion , analogous to the hansen - verlet criterion for freezing , that establishes when we expect the mf treatment to fail or to imply the onset of ordering .",
    "such a criterion might be when the peak height @xmath285 .",
    "returning to the one - body profiles , we note that none of the bulk statepoints in fig .",
    "[ fig:10 ] for adsorption at the planar hard wall are particularly close to the @xmath1-line and we might expect our dft results to be at least qualitatively correct .",
    "however , in fig .",
    "[ fig:11 ] for the density profiles at the planar liquid - gas interface it is clear that the striking _ increase _ in structuring as @xmath61 is increased is a direct consequence of the close proximity of the @xmath1-line . it is unlikely that such behaviour could survive beyond mf . a possible scenario when fluctuations are included is the phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] where there are two kirkwood lines and the critical point lies below the lower line ( 2 ) .",
    "the mf dft would yield monotonically decaying profiles on both sides of the interface for coexisting states just below the critical point but for @xmath286 one would expect damped oscillatory profiles on both the liquid and the gas side . for states with @xmath287 , where the upper kirkwood line ( 1 ) intersects the gas binodal , the asymptotic decay on the gas side would be monotonic .",
    "of course , the mf dft omits effects of capillary wave like fluctuations that act to erode the amplitude of the oscillations ; this mechanism is discussed in ref .   for the case of model colloid - polymer mixtures .",
    "we believe that much more work is required to understand the nature of the fluid correlations in such systems , particularly in regions of the phase diagram where the present mf theory predicts a @xmath1-line . indeed , some of us are already engaged in such studies using monte - carlo simulations and various integral equation theories . of course , one could also employ dft to investigate possible spontaneous ordering , i.e.  whether there are solutions corresponding to non - uniform ( e.g.  periodic ; stripe or cluster ) phases that have a lower free energy than those corresponding to a uniform phase .",
    "we conclude by speculating that since colloidal systems with competing interactions display modulated structures , these systems will have interesting optical properties and may have applications in display technologies .",
