    "the prevailing interpretation of the ly@xmath0 forest is that it arises naturally from absorption by trace amounts of neutral hydrogen in a photo - ionized , inhomogenous intergalactic medium ( igm ) . to model the ly@xmath0 forest within this picture no speculative assumptions about the physical properties of individual ly@xmath0 absorbers have to be made .",
    "one merely considers a cosmological simulation of structure formation , including dark matter and a baryonic component as well as a photo - ionizing background radiation field , and evaluates the absorption properties along lines of sight through the simulation box at desired redshifts . during the past few years",
    "it has been realized that the artificial absorption spectra resulting from this approach bear close resemblance to the ly@xmath0 forest seen in qso absorption spectra , and these cosmological models of the ly@xmath0 forest have been able to quantitatively account for the observed distribution functions in hi column density and b - parameters to a reasonable accuracy ( @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ; for related semianalytic modeling see , e.g. , @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .    within recent years , observations have demonstrated that strong ly@xmath0 forest absorbers generally show associated metal line absorption ( @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "selected metal absorption lines can be readily incorporated into cosmological models of the ly@xmath0 forest from a knowledge of densities , temperature , and uv radiation field along the lines of sight , if a metal enrichment pattern of the baryonic igm is specified .",
    "such models account fairly well for the observed properties of the civ(1548  , 1550  ) doublet and a handful of other lines , for an igm metallicity @xmath7 , if a scatter of about an order of magnitude is assumed ( @xcite @xcite @xcite ) .    instead of making an a priori selection of a few metal lines to include in a model , it is useful to make the models _ predict _ which metal lines , out of hundreds of candidates , should be observable ( in spectra of a given resolution and s / n ) associated with ly@xmath0 absorbers of given metallicities and hi column densities .",
    "such an approach allows a comprehensive screening for lines that deserve a more detailed treatment , dependent on the specific purpose of the modeling , and allows for the sharpest possible test of the models .",
    "we describe the results from an implementation of such a technique in the following .",
    "let us denote a metal absorption line produced by an element @xmath8 in ionization stage @xmath9 with rest transition wavelength @xmath10 and oscillator strength @xmath11 as @xmath12 .",
    "for such a line associated with with a ly@xmath0 absorber of neutral hydrogen column density @xmath5 and metallicity @xmath13 \\equiv \\log{(n_z / n_h)}-\\log{(n_z / n_h)_{\\odot}}$ ] we can define the following _ line observability index _ :    @xmath14,n_{\\rm hi } ) & \\equiv &   -17.05 \\ , + \\",
    ", \\log{n_{\\rm hi } } \\ , + \\ , [ { \\rm z / h } ] \\ , + \\log{(f\\ , { \\lambda}^2 ) } \\\\ \\nonumber    & & + \\log{({n_z / n_{\\rm h}})_{\\odot } } \\ , + \\ , \\log{(x_z^i / x_h^0)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "this expression assumes units of @xmath15 for @xmath5 and  for @xmath10 .",
    "the choice of additive constant then implies @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the rest equivalent width , for weak lines .",
    "hence , this quantity can be used to rank metal lines in terms of strength , and it can be compared to detection limits in spectra of a given quality .",
    "the model - dependent ionization corrections are contained in the last term , the ratio of ionization fractions of @xmath18 and @xmath19 within the absorber .    as a specific application of the lox technique we use the standard cdm , @xmath20 , @xmath21 simulation described in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we assume a haardt & madau background radiation spectrum of slope -1.8 at the high - energy end @xcite normalized to match the observed mean flux decrement @xmath22 @xcite , and we focus on redshifts @xmath23 .",
    "the simulations exhibit rather tight correlations between @xmath5 of an absorbing region and the typical temperature and total gas density within the region , so the ionization correction term is essentially a function only of @xmath5 , and we calculate this term using the photoionization code cloudy 90 @xcite .    the lox has been evaluated for 199 metal lines from the database contained in the voigt profile fitting software vpfit @xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the results as a function on @xmath5 for nine of the strongest lines , assuming a carbon abundance of [ c / h]=-2.5 and a relative abundance pattern similar to that observed in population ii stars .",
    "a more exhaustive list of lines is presented in @xcite , which also discusses the dependence of the lox on @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and the normalization of the radiation field @xmath26 .",
    "this dependence is weak , and the following predictions are believed to hold rather generally in cosmological models of the ly@xmath0 forest :    * the civ(1548  , 1550  ) doublet is the strongest line with rest wavelength @xmath27 regardless of the hi column density of the absorber . * ovi(1032  , 1038  ) is the only detectable line in low column density ( @xmath28 ) absorbers , and hence the best probe of metallicity in the low density igm . * the ciii(977  ) and siiii(1206  ) lines are the potentially strongest metal lines , but they are only expected to be seen in the relatively uncommon absorbers with @xmath29 .",
    "the first prediction is easily verifiable from available data and is found to hold .",
    "the other predictions , featuring lines that are embedded in the ly@xmath0 forest , remain to be verified . if few or no ovi lines are found at @xmath23 in real spectra then the metallicity of the low - density regions of the igm may actually be less than -2.5 , or alternatively there may be a problem with this picture of the ly@xmath0 forest . in absorbers with higher values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the higher number of observable metal lines makes a more thorough comparison between model and observations possible .",
    "we are currently initiating a detailed systematic study of the distributions and relative strenghts of metal lines associated with such systems .",
