    "it is more than fifty years since the study of the accretion flows on to gravitating compact objects began .",
    "bondi@xmath2 first showed that spherically symmetric matter would pass through a sonic sphere before falling on a sufficiently compact object .",
    "however , the matter has a large radial motion .",
    "close to the black hole , velocity is very high , and thus the density is low . as a result , the flow has a very low radiation efficiency .",
    "discovery of quasars and active galaxies in this decade required that the efficiency be improved . for this , several important steps were taken .",
    "first , shvartsman@xmath3 introduced dissipation due to entangled magnetic field . shapiro@xmath4 computed the degree of dissipation and found that the luminosity is increased by a significant amount .",
    "however , this was still not sufficient to explain quasar luminosity .",
    "shakura - sunyaev@xmath5 introduced keplerian thin disk models of the active galaxies .",
    "these are efficient and did indeed explain the ` big blue bump ' in uv / euv region of the spectra of the active galaxies@xmath6 .",
    "however , power - law high energy x - rays could not be accounted for by this model .",
    "chang and ostriker@xmath7 and kazanas and elision@xmath8 resorted to introducing accretion shocks where the temperature and density would be enhanced and the radiation efficiency is also increased .",
    "the former introduced pre - heating dominated shocks at a very large distance from the black hole , while the latter introduced pair - plasma pressure supported shocks close to the black hole .",
    "chakrabarti@xmath9 showed that centrifugal barrier in a low angular momentum accretion flow can produce stable shocks for a wide range of parameter space provided the flow has specific angular momentum everywhere small compared to the keplerian value .",
    "this work was further put to test by chakrabarti and wiita@xmath10 and chakrabarti and titarchuk@xmath11 who showed that shocks could play a major role in determining the spectrum of the emitted radiation . particularly important",
    "is that , post - shock region which is known as the cenbol ( centrifugal pressure supported boundary layer ) and which is the repository of hot electrons , can easily inverse comptonize photons from a keplerian disk located in the pre - shock region and the power - law component of the flow may be formed easily without taking resort to any hypothetical electron cloud originally invoked in the literature@xmath12 .",
    "thus , the cenbol region in between the horizon and the shock as introduced by chakrabarti and his co - workers behave like a boundary layer where the flow dissipates its gravitational energy .",
    "furthermore , shocks have been found to be oscillating when the cooling is introduced and this is explained to be the cause of the quasi - periodic oscillations in x - rays@xmath13 .",
    "however , astrophysical shocks also play a major role in acceleration of particles .",
    "it is well known that the high energy cosmic rays are produced by shock acceleration@xmath14 .",
    "these shocks are transient in nature and still play an important role in shaping the spectrum .",
    "hence , it is likely that the _ standing shocks _ , through which majority of the accreting matter must _ pass _ before entering into a black hole , or forming a jet , should be important to energize electrons .",
    "this shocks are very stable and remain virtually in place even after non - axisymmetric perturbations@xmath15 .",
    "it is thus fitting that we be interested to understand how the energetics of the high energy electrons is affected by these shocks and how the spectrum is affected by the synchrotron radiation produced by these energetic particles .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present the basic equations and the relevant parameters for the problem .",
    "we assume the paczynski - wiita@xmath16 potential to describe the space - time around a non - rotating black hole .",
    "we introduce a major emitting component , the accretion shocks . in section 3 , we present the relevant heating and cooling processes which are taking place in the accretion flow . in section 4 ,",
    "we discuss how a broad band spectra may be obtained . in section 5",
    ", we present a typical spectrum and its components .",
    "we also give particular emphasis to high energy gamma - ray emissions in hard and soft states .",
    "finally , in section 6 , we present concluding remarks .     cartoon diagram of a quasi - spherical , low - angular momentum accretion around a compact object .",
    "dark shaded region indicates a standing shock formed by centrifugal force .",
    "as far as the flow topology is concerned , we assume it to be thin , axi - symmetric , and of conical cross - section . the flow is assumed to be from winds of the companion star as in the case of a stellar black hole , or supermassive black holes .",
    "we do not consider the presence of a keplerian disk , or , if present it is assumed to be very far from the region of consideration .",
    "the motivation of our present work is to see what the advective disk emits through bremsstrahlung , comptonization and synchrotron emission . in a future work",
    "we shall incorporate the keplerian disk as well .",
    "figure 1 gives a cartoon diagram of the flow geometry we consider in this paper .",

    "we use @xmath50 , the compression ratio , to be a free parameter as well .",

    "the curve marked ` 8 ' and ` 9 ' represents respectively the bremsstrahlung emission and it s comptonization from the post - shock flow .",
    "the curve marked ` 10 ' is the total broad - band spectra from the pre - shock and the post - shock regions .",
    "@xmath68 indicates the synchrotron self - absorption frequency .",
    "a typical broad - band spectrum with all the contributions from the accretion flow is shown for the same parameter as in fig .",
    "2 ( see text for details ) .",
    "it is clear that the power - law electrons , which are the hall - mark of the shock in accretion can leave its signature on the emitted spectrum .",
    "the curve ` 6 ' is soft and thermal component , while the curve ` 7 ' is hard and is generally from the non - thermal power - law component emitted by the power - law electrons .    when the shock - location is varied , the following changes are expected : when the shock is located very close to the black hole , the hot pre - shock flow is the dominant source of comptonized photons while when the shock is very far away , the post - shock region ( cenbol ) also contributes , but as a whole , the contribution is much lower as the outer flow is cooler .",
    "when the compression ratio is varied , the optical depth in the post - shock region is changed . for a weak shock ,",
    "the jump in density @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath137 denote the post and pre - shock values respectively , at the shock is not so high . in this case , the power law electrons are not energetic enough to leave its signature in the spectrum . when the accretion rate increased , it is expected to increase the density of the flow and it becomes difficult to cool the matter by the soft photons of the synchrotron radiation .",
    "the comptonized spectrum becomes harder . at lower accretion rate , it is easy to cool the flow and the spectrum becomes softer .",
    "when the percentage of power - law electrons , namely , @xmath116 is increased the spectrum becomes harder at high energy .",
    "we now discuss the basic changes in the flow properties which must occur if the spectral state is to switch from hard to soft state ( in soft - x - ray region ) and vice versa . in fig .",
    "4 , we present the photon spectra in the hard and the soft states . the hard state was created with @xmath138 , @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "in the soft state , the accretion rate @xmath127 , @xmath143 and @xmath144 was chosen .",
    "other parameters were kept fixed . here too , we did not consider the presence of a keplerian disk , which can also supply soft photons , as we are interested only in the behaviour of an advective flow .",
    "state transitions occurring in a black hole candidate when the accretion rate and the shock location is varied .",
    "the thermal bump in the hard state causes two intersections to form one at a few kev and the other at a few hundred kev ( see text for details ) .",
    "the spectra in soft and hard states are shown only at high energy region .",
    "the thermal bump is due to thermal electrons from the post - shock region while the non - thermal power - law components are due to non - thermal electrons generated by the shock - acceleration .    in the soft state ,",
    "the spectral slope is high and the energy spectral index @xmath145 ( @xmath146 ) from the photons from thermal electrons is found to be @xmath147 which that for the not - thermal electrons is @xmath148 . in the hard state @xmath149 and @xmath150 . because of the thermal bump at around @xmath151kev , the two spectra intersect at two energies , one at lower energy ( @xmath152kev ) and the other at a high energy @xmath1kev .",
    "normally , the intersection at the lower energy is a pivotal point@xmath11 . in fig .",
    "5 we zoom the high energy region of the spectrum and show the nature of the each components . the thermal component in the hard state",
    "is from the thermal electrons in the pre - shock and the post - shock flow .",
    "the non - thermal power - law component in the hard state is coming from the power - law electrons in the post - shock region .",
    "the non - thermal component in the soft - state is from non - thermal electrons .",
    "if one compares with observation one notices that the black hole candidates cyg x-1@xmath153 groj1719 - 24 and groj4022 + 32 all show the similar characteristics as presented in fig .",
    "5 ( see , ling & wheaton@xmath154 and references therein ) .",
    "we therefore believe successful reproduction of the salient features in our solution shows that the non - thermal emission , at least in these class of black holes , is probably coming from the accretion flow itself .    in fig .",
    "6 , we have presented the variation of the spectral indices of the thermal component and the non - thermal components as function of the sub - keplerian rate @xmath117 . the other parameters are , @xmath155 and @xmath144 .",
    "generally speaking , both the spectral indices decrease initially with the accretion rate but after about an eddington rate , where the optical depth itself started getting larger than unity , the spectra start becoming softer as expected .",
    "variation of the spectral slopes of the thermal and the non - thermal components @xmath156 and @xmath157 respectively as a function of the dimensionless accretion rate .",
    "in this paper , we have explored the way a shock in an accretion flow may be identified by observing the spectrum .",
    "we have used the shock location and its strength as free parameters ( at the expense of the specific angular momentum and viscosity parameters ) although we have used reasonable values discussed in earlier analytical studies .",
    "we considered the soft photons due to bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation as the seed photons for the comptonization .",
    "we also included the shock acceleration of the electrons and their effect on the emitted spectrum .",
    "we have incorporated the splitting of temperature of the electrons and protons due to radiative processes .",
    "our conclusion is that there are several ways a shock may be distinguished in the spectrum . at a strong shock ,",
    "the power - law electrons are produced with a very high @xmath158 and that produces a power - law feature in the spectrum .",
    "these power - law features are seen in both the hard and the soft components in the same manner as observed in the galactic black hole candidates such as cyg x-1 , groj1719 - 24 and groj4022 + 32 .",
    "we find that since the shocks are inbuilt in the advective disk solutions , and electrons can easily produce high energy radiation first through shock acceleration and then through synchrotron emission , one need not invoke extra source of high energy photons as are usually done in the literature@xmath159 .",
    "the outflow that is derived from a cenbol itself can have shocks in jets which in turn may also emit power - law emissions and contribute to the total spectra .",
    "we shall explore this aspect of the problem in near future .    in chakrabarti & titarchuk@xmath11 soft photons due to a keplerian disk",
    "was responsible to cool down the post - shock region . in the present paper , we deviate from that paper in the sense that we assume that the keplerian disk is either located very far away , or non - existent .",
    "the soft photons are locally generated due to thermal and magnetic bremsstrahlung processes . in presence of a keplerian disk ,",
    "the soft x - ray bump will be produced at around a few kev , while for shocks the bump is located in uv .",
    "thus , it is possible that these two distinct bumps can be distinguished through observation .",
    "this work will also be presented elsewhere",
    ".    there has been mush discussions about the so - called advection dominated accretion flows or adaf ( see , esin et al.@xmath160 and references therein ) which also claims to produce quasi - spherical accretion accretion as the transonic flows described in chakrabarti@xmath161 . however ,",
    "adafs or any of its modifications do not have any shocks as in our transonic solution and therefore they need to invoke external sources of non - thermal electrons . thus our solutions require lesser parameters that the class models based on adaf ."
