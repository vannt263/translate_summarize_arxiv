    "a resonant structure in the invariant mass of @xmath6 at 4.43 gev with a width of 45 mev was recently reported by belle in @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "this result immediately provoked much interest from experiment and theory due to the possibility of it being a tetraquark candidate  @xcite with flavor @xmath8 or @xmath9 , i.e. a charmonium with isospin @xmath10 .",
    "it has also been proposed that this structure may be due to subthreshold effects in @xmath11 rescattering  @xcite .",
    "similar to the @xmath12 which is proposed to be a possible bound state of @xmath13 due to long - range @xmath14 exchange forces  @xcite , such a mechanism will favor @xmath15 or @xmath16 for @xmath0 with @xmath10  @xcite .",
    "also , it has been suggested by maiani _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite that the strong coupling of the @xmath0 to @xmath1 instead of @xmath17 could be a signal for a radially excited @xmath18 tetraquark .",
    "long ago close and lipkin  @xcite proposed that @xmath19 is a channel that could identify tetraquark states such as @xmath18 in s - wave or , most interesting , @xmath20 in p - wave , hence we shall also consider that @xmath21 occurs via @xmath22-wave transition if it has @xmath23 .",
    "in particular , a large coupling to @xmath1 will have special implications for its photoproduction rate , and information about its quantum numbers may be extracted .",
    "seeing this state in an independent production process will be essential for establishing its existence and determining its nature .",
    "we propose here to look for the @xmath0 in photoproduction .",
    "if @xmath0 is a genuine signal for a tetraquark state which couples to @xmath1 , then it can necessarily be photoproduced via @xmath14 exchange through the @xmath24 intermediate coupling .",
    "it suggests that @xmath25 could be a dominant production mechanism for @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , by looking for the signal of @xmath0 in @xmath26 , one may establish this state as a genuine resonance .",
    "we also estimate a possible destructive interference from the intermediate @xmath27 coupling .",
    "although belle does not see the decay of @xmath28 , which implies a weaker @xmath29 coupling , the relatively larger leptonic width for @xmath30 than @xmath31 may still lead to sizeable contributions from intermediate @xmath32 in photoproduction .",
    "we will investigate such effects in a vector meson dominance ( vmd ) model .",
    "in addition , we consider background contributions to this channel which involve pomeron exchanges and nucleon born terms .",
    "interestingly , this shows that these backgrounds have rather small interferences with the @xmath33 production .",
    "this enhances the possibility of identifying or refuting this state in photoproduction .",
    "experimental data from desy may be able to clarify this directly .    in the following we first provide a detailed description of the theoretical model by considering @xmath0 to have either @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the model predictions for the differential and total cross sections will be presented .",
    "we then make a quantitative analysis of the possible background contributions to @xmath34 final state .",
    "dalitz plot analysis will be provided .",
    "the production of @xmath35 in @xmath36 can be described by the processes in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] .",
    "its production possesses different features at different kinematics .",
    "we outline those features below as they are essential for constructing the theoretical model :    \\i ) in the @xmath37-channel , as the electromagnetic ( em ) interaction does not conserve isospin , the @xmath0 can be produced by either isoscalar or isovector exchange . taking into account the flavor content , i.e. @xmath35",
    "has a hidden @xmath38 which does not carry isospin , the isoscalar exchange in the @xmath37-channel will be forbidden for the charged @xmath0 while suppressed for the neutral partner .",
    "we will come back to this point later .",
    "furthermore , as the @xmath0 has only been seen in the @xmath1 channel , we shall concentrate on the @xmath37-channel pion exchange as a leading contribution .",
    "we shall argue that this is likely to give a lower limit for the photoproduction cross section .",
    "we note in advance that the inclusion of e.g. @xmath39 exchange will increase the cross sections since there is no interferences between the pion and @xmath39 exchange amplitudes .",
    "we will present some numerical estimates for the @xmath40 exchange later .",
    "heavier @xmath37-channel meson ( regge ) exchanges contribute to the cross section at off - forward angles and could become important in the higher energy region . as we do not have information about their couplings to @xmath41 , we shall focus on the near - threshold region where the dominant pion exchange can be well - constrained and reliably estimated .",
    "\\ii ) for @xmath3 and @xmath5 , @xmath0 will couple to @xmath42 in @xmath22-wave at leading order , while for @xmath43 , it is via @xmath44-wave .",
    "we apply different effective lagrangians to describe the @xmath45 vertex .",
    "\\iii ) there is no available information about the coupling for a @xmath46 to nucleons .",
    "this will appear in the @xmath47 or @xmath48-channel where @xmath0 can directly couple to @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "the @xmath47-channel process generally becomes important near threshold , and at middle and backward scattering angles . with increasing energies ,",
    "these contributions die out quickly due to the suppression of the @xmath47 and @xmath48-channel propagators and the effects of the nucleon s form factors .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath37-channel pion exchange may remain dominant at forward angles and give the major contribution to the cross section .",
    "based on the above rather general considerations , we identify processes that will drive the @xmath0 production . as the @xmath0",
    "is observed to couple strongly to @xmath51 , we propose to look for signals in @xmath52 , and @xmath53 .",

    "if this were the case , it would also imply that a branching ratio @xmath84 should be visible .",
    "we shall discuss the dependence of the photoproduction cross section on this .    at the meson nucleon coupling vertices we adopt the commonly used lagrangian @xmath85 where a standard value , @xmath86 , is adopted  @xcite . in addition ,",
    "a form factor is applied for the @xmath87 vertex , @xmath88 with @xmath89 gev .",
    "we note that this form factor successfully accounts for the photoproduction of @xmath90 and @xmath91 meson near threshold  @xcite .",
    "some works have argued for a larger value  @xcite .",
    "such values would increase the cross sections relative to what we compute here , and so we use the cited value in the spirit of seeking a lower limit for the cross - section .",

    ", we provide the analogous expressions for @xmath37-channel @xmath39 exchange .",
    "note that the pion and @xmath39 exchanges contribute to the real and imaginary part of the transition amplitude respectively .",
    "thus , there are no interferences between these two channels , and the inclusion of the @xmath39 exchange will enhance the @xmath0 cross section . as we lack knowledge on the @xmath110 and @xmath111 coupling strengths , which are in any event expected to be much smaller than the @xmath14 exchange contributions , we will focus on the pion exchange here .    for neutral @xmath46 production contributions",
    "may also be allowed from pomeron exchange .",
    "however , we argue that this scenario is suppressed due to the following reasons : i ) in the case where the photon ( isoscalar component ) couples to @xmath38 , isospin has to be transferred to the pair of light @xmath112 in order to form @xmath113 .",
    "ii ) the photon can couple to isovector vector mesons made of light @xmath112 , which then pull out a pair of @xmath38 after exchanging a pomeron .",
    "although this process conserves isospin , it is suppressed by the soft creation of a large mass @xmath38 , and also as it requires the @xmath46 meson to be formed with the @xmath112 and @xmath38 pairs at relatively large momentum transfers .",
    "consequently suppression from the final state wavefunction is likely .",
    "precise estimates will be model dependent but for the purpose of estimating a lower limit for the production cross section , we neglect this contribution here .",
    "in contrast , pomeron contributions can generate background . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) , the direct production of @xmath55 allows pomeron exchanges as an important production mechanism .",
    "an intermediate nucleon will then decay into a pion and nucleon . in principle , all the intermediate isospin 1/2 nucleon resonances can contribute to this process .",
    "again , as a simple estimate of the background , we only consider the nucleon pole contributions .      for the production of @xmath0 with @xmath43 ,",

    "although @xmath32 has a relatively large coupling to @xmath141 , whereby @xmath37-channel pion exchange turns to be important in @xmath142 , the coupling is not as large as that for @xmath45 . consequently , the predicted threshold enhancement in @xmath46 meson photoproduction is strongly driven by the large @xmath45 coupling .",
    "our main concern therefore is the possibility of some further contribution that is large and destructive .",

    "if the @xmath46 meson is a genuine resonance , the threshold enhancement will be a signature for its existence .",

    "we find its contributions are relatively small even if , as an upper limit , we fix the @xmath110 coupling to be the same as @xmath61 . since there is no interference between the @xmath39 and pion exchange amplitudes , we can neglect the @xmath39 exchange in the calculation and only adopt the relatively well - defined pion exchange for estimating the lower bound of the @xmath0 photoproduction cross sections .",
    "we find that due to pion exchange , a clear threshold enhancement is predicted for @xmath0 photoproduction , which is different from photoproduction of @xmath32 and @xmath55 near threshold , and could be a signature for the @xmath0 existence .",
    "this is also the kinematic region that uncertainties arising from other unknown processes can be overlooked as a reasonable approximate .",
    "we also consider possible background contributions to the signals in @xmath214 , where the diffractive production of @xmath55 turns to be the leading source .",
    "interestingly , it shows that the interferences from the background terms are rather small . in the dalitz plot at @xmath202 gev ( @xmath215 gev ) , a clear band of the @xmath46 meson signals appear in the invariant mass spectrum of @xmath51 .",
    "similar results are obtained for the neutral production channel . for other background contributions from diffractive transitions",
    ", we argue that they may be suppressed by isospin conservation and momentum mismatching .",
    "although nucleon resonance contributions to the background in fig .  [ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) have not been included in this calculation , their effects are unlikely to submerge the @xmath0 band in the dalitz plot .",
    "the reason is that the nucleon resonance cross sections will accumulate horizontally in a form of uneven bands , and be located at @xmath216 gev@xmath206 . in the kinematics of higher @xmath204 interferences from the nucleon resonances",
    "are expected to be negligible . as a consequence",
    ", the @xmath0 production signals can be rather cleanly isolated from the background , and the measurement of the angular distributions between @xmath55 and @xmath14 will tell whether they are in a relative @xmath44 or @xmath22 wave .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath0 can thus be determined .    in summary , in order to establish the @xmath0 as a concrete candidate of tetraquark state and",
    "determine its quantum numbers , further search for its signals in other production processes is necessary .",
