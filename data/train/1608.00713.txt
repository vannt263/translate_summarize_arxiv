    "the hamiltonian cycle problem ( hcp ) is a , now classical , graph theory problem that can be stated as follows : given a graph @xmath9 on @xmath1 vertices , determine whether any simple cycles of length @xmath1 exist in @xmath9 .",
    "such simple cycles are called _ hamiltonian cycles _ , and graphs which contain at least one hamiltonian cycle are called _",
    "hcp is known to be np - complete even when restricted to regular graphs @xcite .",
    "the related problem of determining the number of hamiltonian cycles in a graph is a # p - complete problem .",
    "there have been a number of results and conjectures regarding upper and lower bounds on the numbers of hamiltonian cycles in regular graphs .",
    "eppstein @xcite conjectured that 3-regular graphs on @xmath1 vertices have at most @xmath10 hamiltonian cycles , and provided a family of graphs meeting this bound for each positive @xmath11 . while the validity of this conjecture has not yet been determined , empirical evidence indicates it is likely to be true .",
    "gebauer @xcite has provided the best proven upper bound of @xmath12 .",
    "gebauer s construction is also generalised for regular graphs of higher degree , providing a graph with @xmath13 for any @xmath2 and @xmath1 divisible by @xmath14 .    in terms of regular graphs with few hamiltonian cycles , it is known that hamiltonian 3-regular graphs must contain at least three hcs @xcite , and there are infinite families of 3regular graphs with this number of hcs , such as the generalized petersen graphs @xcite gp(n,2 ) for @xmath15 .",
    "however , such bounds are not known for @xmath0-regular graphs for @xmath16 , and in fact , it is still not known whether _ uniquely hamiltonian _",
    "@xmath0-regular graphs exist ( that is , @xmath0-regular graphs with only a single hamiltonian cycle ) , although it can be seen from @xcite that if such a graph were to exist , it must be for even @xmath0 , and further from @xcite that @xmath17 .",
    "empirical evidence indicates that such a graph is extremely unlikely to exist .    in this manuscript ,",
    "a construction is provided that produces a graph for any choice of @xmath2 , and @xmath3 for integer @xmath4 .",
    "it will be shown that the number of hamiltonian cycles in such a graph is @xmath18^{m}$ ] , which we will observe appears to be a small value for @xmath0-regular graphs .",
    "note that @xmath19 irrespective of the choice of @xmath1 , but this result is dominated by the presence of 3-regular graphs with three hcs . for @xmath7",
    "an alternative construction will be provided for which the number of hamiltonian cycles is less than @xmath20 for all @xmath8 . for any choice of @xmath5 , however , it will be conjectured that there are at most two @xmath0-regular graphs with fewer hcs than @xmath21 . in particular , for odd @xmath5 there will be precisely one of order @xmath22 , and for even @xmath23 there will be two , of order @xmath22 and @xmath24 respectively",
    "for any choice of @xmath2 and @xmath3 for integer @xmath4 , a graph @xmath25 can be constructed by the following scheme .    1 .",
    "take @xmath26 copies of @xmath27 , and label them @xmath28 .",
    "2 .   remove one edge in each of @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in each case",
    "the removed edge was incident on two vertices .",
    "label the two vertices in @xmath29 as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the two vertices in @xmath30 as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "3 .   remove two edges incident on a common vertex in each of @xmath35 . in each case , label the common vertex @xmath36 for @xmath37 . also , each removed edge was incident on another vertex , label these @xmath38 and @xmath39 for @xmath37 .",
    "4 .   add edges @xmath40 and @xmath41 for all @xmath42 .",
    "an example of the above construction for @xmath43 and @xmath44 can be seen in figure [ fig - example ] .     and @xmath44 .",
    "the four component graphs are displayed on the left , and the constructed graph @xmath45 is displayed on the right.,title=\"fig : \" ]   and @xmath44 .",
    "the four component graphs are displayed on the left , and the constructed graph @xmath45 is displayed on the right.,title=\"fig : \" ]    it is easy to check that @xmath25 constructed in the above way is connected and @xmath0-regular .",
    "next , we determine the number of hcs in @xmath25 , which we denote by @xmath46 .",
    "the number of hamiltonian cycles in @xmath25 is    @xmath47^{\\frac{n}{k+1}}.\\]][thm - numhc ]    recall that @xmath48 , and note that edges @xmath40 and @xmath41 constitute edge cutsets of size 2 for each @xmath42 .",
    "hence , all of those edges must be included in every hc of @xmath25 .",
    "in particular , this means that in the hc , each @xmath49 is visited between @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 .",
    "then , consider an hc beginning at @xmath34 .",
    "the hc then travels through all @xmath49 in reverse order until it reaches @xmath32 . at this point",
    ", the rest of @xmath29 must be traversed before visiting vertex @xmath31 .",
    "there are @xmath53 ways of doing so .",
    "then , each @xmath54 is visited in order for @xmath37 .",
    "each time , it is entered via vertex @xmath39 .",
    "then , the only remaining edge by which it may be departed emanates from @xmath38 , so this vertex must be visited last , and vertex @xmath36 has previously been visited .",
    "this leaves @xmath55 possible ways of traversing each @xmath54 .",
    "finally , @xmath30 is revisited via vertex @xmath33 , and there remains @xmath53 ways of visiting the remaining vertices before returning to @xmath34 and completing the hc .",
    "it is then clear that    @xmath56 ^ 2\\left[(k-2)!\\right]^{m-2}\\\\ & = & \\frac{\\left[(k-1)!\\right]^2\\left[(k-2)!\\right]^m}{\\left[(k-2)!\\right]^2}\\\\ & = & ( k-1)^2\\left[(k-2)!\\right]^{\\frac{n}{k+1}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "as mentioned previously , @xmath19 for all values of @xmath1 , so there are infinitely many 3-regular graphs with fewer hamiltonian cycles than @xmath57 . however , for some choices of @xmath16 , this may not be the case . to investigate this ,",
    "the minimum number of hamiltonian cycles in @xmath0-regular graphs of order @xmath1 was computed for various small values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "those minimum numbers are displayed in table [ tab - minhcs ] , and they indicate that , at least for small values of @xmath1 where such calculations are tractable , there are very few graphs with fewer than @xmath21 hamiltonian cycles .",
    "the numbers in table [ tab - minhcs ] were computed by first using genreg @xcite to construct all @xmath0-regular graphs on @xmath1 vertices for various values of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , and then using the hamiltonian cycle enumeration algorithm by chalaturnyk @xcite to count the number of hamiltonian cycles in each . in order to speed up the computations ,",
    "the sets of graphs were partitioned into manageable subsets and distributed over 800 cores . in all cases checked exhaustively , the minimal example had vertex connectivity 2 if any such graphs existed for that choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( that is , for @xmath58 ) .",
    "indeed , it was typical for not only the minimal graph to have vertex connectivity 2 , but the vast majority of near - minimal \" graphs as well . to that end , in the cases where the number of graphs to be checked exceeded 100 million ( respectively , @xmath59 for @xmath7 , @xmath60 for @xmath43 , @xmath61 for @xmath62 ) , only the graphs with vertex connectivity 2 were checked .",
    "those figures are in boxes shaded grey to distinguish them from the values calculated exhaustively .",
    ".the first table displays the minimum number of hamiltonian cycles for all @xmath0-regular graphs on @xmath1 vertices , and the second table displays @xmath21 .",
    "entries of - indicate no graphs exist for that choice of @xmath1 and @xmath0 .",
    "shaded values indicate that only graphs with vertex connectivity 2 were checked for that choice of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in analysing table [ tab - minhcs ] , first consider the case where @xmath63 . the only graphs with fewer hamiltonian cycles than @xmath21 for @xmath63 discovered during testing were @xmath27 for @xmath16 , and the _ cocktail party graph _ @xcite of order @xmath64 for even @xmath16 .",
    "the complete graph @xmath27 contains @xmath65 hamiltonian cycles which is strictly less than @xmath66 for all @xmath67 .",
    "the cocktail party graph of order @xmath68 is equivalent to a complete graph on order @xmath69 minus a perfect matching .",
    "the cocktail party graph of order 3 is displayed in figure [ fig - cocktail3 ] .",
    "the number of hamiltonian cycles in the cocktail party graph is equivalent to the solution of the so - called _ relaxed mnage problem _ , which requests the number of ways to seat a given number of couples around a circular table so that nobody sits next to their partner , up to symmetry .",
    "hence , we can use the result in @xcite to determine the number of hamiltonian cycles in the cocktail party graph of order @xmath64 :    @xmath70    using the link between the relaxed mnage problem and the hamiltonian cycle of the @xmath1-octohedron , we can take advantage of a result in @xcite to see that the number of hamiltonian cycles in the cocktail party graph of order @xmath64 is strictly less than @xmath71 . then stirling s formula for the approximation of factorials @xcite",
    "can be used to show that @xmath72 for all @xmath73 . hence , cocktail party graphs will always have fewer hcs than the equivalent sized graph arising from the construction in the previous section .",
    "note that cocktail party graphs are always regular graphs of even order .",
    "note also that , for even @xmath0 , the two graphs described above are the only two graphs that exist on order @xmath74 . for odd @xmath0 , only @xmath27 exists for @xmath74 .    the analysis for the case where @xmath7 reveals that , in addition to @xmath75 and the cocktail party graph of order 3 , there were two more graphs found that have fewer hamiltonian cycles than suggested by @xmath76 .",
    "the first is the circulant graph ci@xmath77 which has 23 hamiltonian cycles , which is less than @xmath78 .",
    "the second is a graph on 16 vertices which is the first member of a new family of graphs described in the following section that is , to the best of the author s knowledge , the best known construction for 4regular graphs with minimal hamiltonian cycles .",
    "the above analysis leads to the following conjecture .    for @xmath5 and @xmath6 ,",
    "all @xmath0-regular graphs have at least @xmath46 hamiltonian cycles.[conj1 ]",
    "a family of 4regular graphs @xmath79 on @xmath80 vertices , for any @xmath81 , can be constructed as follows .    1 .",
    "take two copies of @xmath75 , and label them @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "also take @xmath26 copies of the cocktail party graph of order 3 , and label them @xmath84 . in each copy , label the vertices as in figure [ fig - cocktail3 ] .",
    "2 .   remove edge @xmath85 in @xmath82 , and edge @xmath86 in @xmath83 .",
    "3 .   remove edges @xmath85 and @xmath86 in all copies of @xmath84 .",
    "4 .   for each @xmath87 , label vertex 1 from @xmath88 as @xmath89 , vertex @xmath90 from @xmath88 as @xmath91 , vertex @xmath92 from @xmath93 as @xmath94 and vertex @xmath95 from @xmath93 as @xmath96 . then add edges @xmath97 and @xmath98 .      .",
    "the four component graphs are displayed on the left , and the constructed graph @xmath100 is displayed on the right.,title=\"fig : \" ] .",
    "the four component graphs are displayed on the left , and the constructed graph @xmath100 is displayed on the right.,title=\"fig : \" ]    using a similar argument to the proof of theorem [ thm - numhc ] , it can be seen that all hamiltonian cycles in a graph constructed in this manner must use every one of the added edges .",
    "then , it is easy to check that each of the @xmath26 copies of the cocktail party graph of order 3 can only be validly traversed in two ways each , and both copies of @xmath75 in six ways each .",
    "hence , the following result emerges immediately .",
    "the above construction can be generalised for even @xmath63 , using two copies of @xmath27 and @xmath26 copies of the cocktail party graph of order @xmath64 , but such graphs do not appear to have fewer than @xmath46 hamiltonian cycles .",
    "experiments for small @xmath0 indicate that the best such constructions are equivalent to the above except the order of cocktail party graphs used is @xmath103 , and edges @xmath85 and @xmath104 are to be removed in place of @xmath85 and @xmath86 respectively . for @xmath105",
    "this produces graphs with @xmath106 hamiltonian cycles for @xmath107 vertices , and for @xmath108 this produces graphs with @xmath109 vertices . in both cases , these values are greater than @xmath46 for all positive @xmath1 , indicating that this construction is likely to be only useful for @xmath7 .",
    "this manuscript is now concluded with a second conjecture .",
    "it is worth noting that , should conjectures [ conj1 ] and [ conj2 ] be proved correct , it would answer in the affirmative the long - standing conjecture @xcite that no @xmath110-regular graphs are uniquely hamiltonian for @xmath111",
