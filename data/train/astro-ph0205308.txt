    "in cosmological models based on cold dark matter ( cdm ) , the first stars are believed to form within small protogalaxies , with virial temperatures @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "cooling within these protogalaxies is dominated by molecular hydrogen , @xmath0 , which forms via the gas - phase reactions @xmath3 and @xmath4 even in the absence of dust . although the fractional abundance of @xmath0 that forms in this way is small , it is sufficient to allow for effective cooling and the formation of stars @xcite .",
    "as soon as massive stars form , however , they immediately begin to photoionize and photodissociate this @xmath0 .",
    "photoionization requires photons with energies greater than @xmath5 , which are strongly absorbed by neutral hydrogen , and is only of importance within regions .",
    "photodissociation , by contrast , occurs through the absorption of photons in the lyman - werner band system @xcite , with energies in the range @xmath6  @xmath7 .",
    "these photons are not strongly absorbed by neutral hydrogen and can readily escape into the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "initially , many of these photons will be absorbed by intergalactic @xmath0 , but its abundance is small and it is rapidly photodissociated ( see section  [ ther_chem ] below ) .",
    "consequently , the onset of star formation is soon followed by the appearance of an ultraviolet background radiation field .",
    "this ultraviolet background acts to suppress further star formation by photodissociating @xmath0 within newly - forming protogalaxies .",
    "the effects of this background have been studied by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "in particular , @xcite study the coupled problem of the evolution of the ultraviolet background and its feedback on the global star formation rate using a simple galaxy formation model based on the press - schechter formalism @xcite .",
    "they find that cooling ( and hence star formation ) within small protogalaxies is completely suppressed prior to cosmological reionization .",
    "taken at face value , their results suggest that star formation within small , @xmath0-cooled protogalaxies is a transient phenomenon , with little impact on later stages of galaxy formation .    these conclusions , however , rest on the assumption that the only free electrons present in the protogalactic gas come from the small residual fraction remaining after cosmological recombination .",
    "this is important , as free electrons ( and protons ) catalyze @xmath0 formation , as we can see from equations  [ h2f1 ] to [ h2f4 ] .",
    "if the free electron abundance were significantly higher , then the @xmath0 formation rate would also be higher , offsetting the effects of photodissociation . at the very least",
    ", this would delay the suppression of star formation , and in principle could entirely negate it .",
    "it is therefore important to determine whether there is any way in which an enhanced level of ionization could be produced .",
    "one possible source is the residual ionization that would remain after the recombination of regions produced by an earlier generation of stars .",
    "this has recently been studied by @xcite , who find that it can be an effective source of @xmath0 and can dramatically reduce the effectiveness of photodissociation feedback .",
    "however , their conclusions are still somewhat uncertain , both because their simulations are under - resolved ( see figures 57 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and because they neglect the effects of supernovae , which would act to disperse the gas and significantly lengthen the recombination timescale , thereby delaying the formation of @xmath0 .",
    "an alternative possibility is ionization by a high redshift x - ray background . at x - ray energies ,",
    "the optical depth of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is small and any x - ray sources present will naturally generate an x - ray background .",
    "moreover , x - rays can penetrate to large depths within newly - formed protogalaxies , allowing them to raise the fractional ionization throughout the gas .",
    "the potential importance of such a background was first highlighted by @xcite , with high redshift quasars suggested as a possible source . using a very simple model for a quasar - produced x - ray background , they showed that if quasars contribute more than 10% of the uv background , then the ionization produced by the associated x - ray background is sufficient to negate the effects of uv photodissociation .",
    "indeed , they found evidence that such a background could actually promote cooling within the dense gas in the centres of protogalaxies . this scenario has not yet been firmly ruled out , but observational evidence suggests that quasars are unlikely to be present in sufficient number at high redshift @xcite .",
    "quasars , however , are not the only potential source of x - rays .",
    "star formation also leads to the production of x - rays , primarily through the formation of massive x - ray binaries @xcite , but also through bremsstrahlung and inverse compton emission from supernova remnants .",
    "these sources generate only a small fraction of the present - day x - ray background @xcite , but may become dominant at high redshifts .    in this paper , we examine the effects of the x - rays produced by these sources , both on the cooling of gas within virialized protogalaxies and also on the chemical and thermal evolution of the igm .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ back ] , we discuss the sources responsible for producing the uv and x - ray backgrounds , and show how the build - up of these backgrounds can be computed . in section  [ meth ] ,",
    "we outline the method used to study the effect of this radiation on the primordial gas , and in section  [ res ] apply it for a number of different x - ray source models .",
    "we present our conclusions in section  [ conc ] .",
    "for an observer at redshift @xmath8 , we can write the mean specific intensity of the radiation background at an observed frequency @xmath9 as @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the proper space - averaged volume emissivity , @xmath13 is the optical depth at frequency @xmath9 due to material along the line of sight from redshift @xmath8 to @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the cosmological line element . to solve this equation",
    ", we need to know how the emissivity and opacity evolve with redshift .      for simplicity , we write the space - averaged emissivity in terms of the global star formation rate ( sfr ) as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the luminosity density ( i.e. the luminosity per unit frequency ) per unit star formation rate ( in solar masses per year ) , and @xmath18 is the global star formation rate , with units @xmath19 .    in principle , @xmath17 may be a complicated function of frequency and redshift . in practice , however , lyman - werner band emission is dominated by massive , short - lived ob stars and declines rapidly once star formation comes to an end ( see , for example , the instantaneous starburst models of * ? ? ?",
    "* in which the lyman - werner flux declines by an order of magnitude within 4@xmath20 ) .",
    "similarly , x - ray emission is dominated by short - lived sources such as massive x - ray binaries and supernova remnants which are end products of the same massive stars .",
    "both kinds of emission are therefore strongly correlated with the star formation rate ; to a first approximation , we can assume that they are directly proportional to it , and that any redshift dependence of @xmath17 can be neglected . with this simplification , determining the emissivity breaks down into two independent problems : determining the global star formation rate as a function of redshift , and determining the luminosity density as a function of the star formation rate .",
    "although we have observational constraints on the star formation rate up to @xmath21 , we have no direct constraints ( and few indirect ones ) at higher redshift .",
    "consequently , any model of high redshift star formation must inevitably be highly theoretical .",
    "moreover , this lack of constraints motivates us to choose as simple a model as possible ; more complicated ( and realistic ) models can always be considered once our observational knowledge improves .",
    "a good example of this kind of simple model is the one used by @xcite ; we adopt the same model here .",
    "we assume that star formation proceeds primarily through starbursts , of duration @xmath22 years , that are triggered when galaxies form . during the starburst",
    ", the star formation rate is assumed to be constant .",
    "the global star formation rate in this model is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the star formation efficiency , @xmath25 is the baryon fraction ( ie the ratio of baryons to dark matter ) , and where @xmath26 is the cosmological density of matter in newly - formed galaxies ( with units of @xmath27 ) .",
    "we assume that the value of @xmath25 in the protogalaxies is the same as in the igm , or in other words that @xmath28 .",
    "for the cosmological model adopted in section  [ res ] , this corresponds to @xmath29 .",
    "we further assume that the rate of change of @xmath30 is approximately the same as the rate of change of @xmath31 , the total fraction of matter in halos with virial temperatures greater than a critical temperature @xmath32 , or in other words that @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the cosmological matter density .",
    "here , @xmath32 represents the minimum virial temperature required for efficient cooling ; to a first approximation , halos with @xmath35 are unable to cool , while those with @xmath36 cool rapidly and can form stars .",
    "various different definitions of @xmath32 are in use in the literature ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; we discuss our particular choice in a later section .    making this approximation",
    "is equivalent to assuming that the growth in @xmath31 is dominated by the formation of new halos with @xmath37 ( either by monolithic collapse or by the merger of smaller objects ) rather than by the accretion of matter by existing halos with @xmath36 .",
    "this is justified at high redshift when such halos are rare and @xmath31 is dominated by objects near @xmath32 , but becomes less accurate at lower redshifts .",
    "for this reason ( and others , to be discussed later ) we do not attempt to simulate the evolution of the background below @xmath38 .    to solve equation  [ diff_rho ] we need to know the value of @xmath32 .",
    "in general , this will depend both on redshift ( see , eg * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and on the intensities of the uv and x - ray backgrounds . indeed , understanding the evolution of @xmath32 with redshift is one of the main goals of this paper .",
    "our procedure for determining @xmath32 is discussed at length in section  [ meth ] ; for now , we assume that it is known . in this case",
    ", we can calculate @xmath31 using the press - schechter formalism @xcite : @xmath39,\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the critical density threshold for collapse , @xmath41 is the square root of the variance of the cosmological density field , as smoothed on a mass scale @xmath42 , and where @xmath43 is the mass of a protogalaxy with virial temperature @xmath32 .",
    "although both @xmath44 and @xmath41 depend upon the choice of cosmological model , their behaviour is well - known , and the problem of determining @xmath45 reduces to the relatively simple one of relating @xmath43 to @xmath32 .    to do this , we need to know the protogalactic density profile .",
    "hydrodynamical simulations suggest that it is approximately isothermal @xcite , but representing it as a singular isothermal sphere is physically unrealistic due to the latter s infinite central density .",
    "accordingly , we follow @xcite and represent it as a truncated isothermal sphere @xcite . with this choice , we find that @xmath46    to determine @xmath47 , we must integrate equation  [ diff_rho ] over a redshift interval @xmath48 , corresponding to the duration of the starburst ; hence , @xmath49    this simple model has a number of shortcomings . for instance , it assumes that the star formation efficiency @xmath24 and starburst duration @xmath22 are both constant , independent of redshift or galaxy mass .",
    "it also assumes that each galaxy forms its stars in a single starburst and thus ignores the effects of continuous star formation and of subsequent , merger - triggered starbursts .  .",
    "] nevertheless , it has the virtue of simplicity , and is a good point from which to start our examination of the effects of the x - ray background .",
    "the ultraviolet flux of a star - forming galaxy is dominated by emission from young , massive o and b - type stars .",
    "these are short - lived , with the most massive having lifetimes of only a few myr , and thus the ultraviolet luminosity density is closely correlated with the star formation rate .",
    "its value depends upon the spectral properties of the newly - formed stellar population , and thus on their initial mass function ( imf ) , metallicity and age .    in a recent paper",
    ", @xcite presents values for the photon flux in the lyman - werner bands calculated for a number of different metal - free stellar populations .",
    "if we assume that the spectrum within the bands is flat ( a reasonable approximation ) , then we can convert this photon flux into a luminosity density . for a salpeter imf with minimum mass @xmath50 and maximum mass @xmath51 ( model a in",
    "* ) , we find that @xmath52 reducing @xmath53 to the more conventional value of @xmath54 reduces this luminosity to @xmath55 as we form a greater number of low mass stars that do not contribute significantly to the lyman - werner flux .",
    "both of these results assume that the dissociative flux has stabilized at its equilibrium value and is therefore proportional to the star formation rate .",
    "this equilibrium is typically established after only 2  3 myr , so this is generally a good approximation , even for starbursts of relatively short duration .",
    "the above figures are appropriate so long as we are dealing with stars formed out of _ entirely _ metal - free gas .",
    "such stars are somewhat unusual , however , as the absence of carbon means that they are unable to generate energy via the cno cycle , which otherwise would dominate energy production in stars of mass @xmath56 . as a result ,",
    "metal - free stars are hotter than their metal - enriched counterparts @xcite and have harder spectra .",
    "a surprising consequence of this fact is that a low - metallicity stellar population will produce a larger dissociative flux than a metal - free population ",
    "the lower effective temperatures move the peak in the thermal emission from the most massive stars closer to the lyman - werner band , causing the ionizing flux to fall but the dissociative flux to rise .",
    "we can use the data presented in @xcite for a stellar population with @xmath57 to examine the difference that this effect makes to the lyman - werner flux . using the same imf as in equation  [ flux_dis ] , we find that @xmath58 thus , raising the metallicity increases the lyman - werner flux , but only by about 6070% ; as we will see in section  [ res_nox ] , this has little effect on the evolution of @xmath32 .",
    "clearly , there are many possible models other than those considered here .",
    "indeed , there is growing evidence that the imf of population iii stars is strongly biased towards high masses @xcite .",
    "however , this remains uncertain , and in this paper we have chosen to err on the side of caution and assume that the high - redshift imf is similar to that at the present day .      in a recent study , @xcite collate data on a number of local starburst galaxies and compare the 2  10 @xmath59 x - ray fluxes measured by asca with the 8  1000 @xmath60 infrared fluxes measured by iras .",
    "they find that a clear correlation exists , with the total x - ray and infrared fluxes related by @xmath61 similar correlations have previously been reported by @xcite and @xcite for x - rays in the 0.5  4.5 @xmath59 and 2  30 @xmath59 energy bands respectively .",
    "theoretically , we would expect such a correlation , with both the x - ray and infrared emission tracing the underlying star formation rate . for the x - rays",
    ", this occurs because the emission is dominated by massive x - ray binaries ( mxrbs ) : binary systems consisting of a massive ob star accreting onto a compact companion ( a neutron star or black hole ) .",
    "x - ray emission from such systems generally switches on a few million years after the formation of the compact object , and the lifetime of the emitting phase is short , typically of the order of ( 2  5@xmath62 @xcite .",
    "these short timescales tie the emission closely to the underlying star formation rate @xcite .",
    "the far - infrared flux , on the other hand , tracks star formation far more directly , being dominated by emission from dust heated by short - lived , massive stars .    to use this observed correlation to determine the x - ray luminosity of a star - forming galaxy as a function of its star formation rate , we use the result from the starburst models of @xcite that @xmath63 together with equation  [ x_to_ir ] to write the x - ray luminosity as @xcite @xmath64 we then assume that this relationship between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate remains valid as we move to higher redshifts .",
    "note that the same need not be true for the relationship between x - ray luminosity and infrared luminosity , or infrared luminosity and star formation rate : although they serve to establish the correlation between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate at @xmath65 , the assumption that this correlation remains valid at higher redshift does not imply that these other correlations also remain valid .",
    "indeed , we would expect the infrared luminosity of dust - free protogalaxies to be very much lower than would be predicted by equation  [ ir ] .",
    "evidence that the correlation between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate does indeed remain valid at high redshift is provided by the recent stacking analysis of individually undetected lyman break galaxies in the _ chandra _ deep field - north @xcite .",
    "this analysis finds that the average rest frame luminosity of the lyman break galaxies in the 2  8 @xmath66 energy band is @xmath67 . assuming a typical star formation rate of @xmath68 for these galaxies @xcite , this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity of @xmath69 consistent with the value derived above .",
    "is measured in a slightly different energy band from that of equation  [ lx ] , so the agreement between the two values is not quite as good as may at first appear . nevertheless , the necessary correction is small , and the values agree to within 50% . ]",
    "although far from conclusive , this result suggests that we can extrapolate the locally observed correlation to at least as far as @xmath70 .    comparing our determination of @xmath71 with a recent calculation by @xcite , we find a difference of a factor of ten in our results .",
    "some of this disagreement is due to the difference in x - ray energy bands considered ( @xmath72  @xmath73 in @xcite , compared to @xmath74 ",
    "@xmath75 here ) , but some must surely be due to intrinsic scatter in the observational data , suggesting that equation  [ lx ] should properly be regarded as an order of magnitude estimate of the true x - ray luminosity .    given equation  [ lx ] for the x - ray luminosity as a function of the star formation rate , we calculate the x - ray luminosity density by assuming a template spectrum of power - law form @xmath76 where @xmath77 , and requiring that @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "@xcite find that a weighted average of the galaxies in their sample gives a value for the spectral index of @xmath81 .",
    "adopting this value and solving for @xmath82 , we find that @xmath83 altering @xmath84 changes @xmath82 , but never by more than 50% for values consistent with the @xcite measurement . clearly , individual galaxies may have spectra that differ markedly from this simple template , but it should be a reasonable approximation when averaging over a large number of galaxies .",
    "the above model is simple , and empirically motivated , but does assume that the x - ray emission of high - redshift star - forming galaxies is very similar to that of starbursts observed locally .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption in the absence of evidence to the contrary , and is probably valid as long as massive x - ray binaries continue to dominate the galactic x - ray emission .",
    "however , it is quite possible that at high redshift some other type of source will come to dominate the emission , particularly if the number of binary systems is small , as is suggested by recent simulations @xcite .",
    "it is therefore prudent to consider the effects of other potential sources of x - rays .",
    "the obvious candidates are supernova remnants ( snr ) ; next to x - ray binaries , they are the most significant galactic sources @xcite",
    ". they can emit x - rays through a variety of different emission mechanisms , but at high redshift the most significant will be thermal bremsstrahlung emission and non - thermal inverse compton emission .",
    "thermal bremsstrahlung is produced by the hot gas within the snr .",
    "detailed modeling properly requires a hydrodynamical treatment ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but for our purposes a simple parameterization suffices .",
    "if we assume that the hot gas has a single characteristic temperature @xmath85 , then we can write the luminosity density per unit star formation rate as @xmath86 where @xmath87 and where @xmath88 is constant . moreover , we can write the total x - ray luminosity as @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the typical supernova explosion energy ( in units of @xmath91 ) , @xmath92 is the fraction of this energy radiated as bremsstrahlung , and where @xmath93 is the number of supernovae that explode per solar mass of stars formed .",
    "the value of @xmath93 depends on the imf ; for the standard salpeter imf adopted previously , @xmath94 . finally , since @xmath95 we can fix the value of @xmath88",
    "; we find that @xmath96    for typical supernova parameters ( @xmath97 and an ambient density @xmath98 ) , @xcite find that a fraction @xmath99 of the explosion energy is radiated , at a characteristic temperature @xmath100 .",
    "on the other hand , the higher mean density at high redshift , together with the comparative weakness of outflows from low metallicity stars @xcite suggest that the typical ambient density may be very much higher .",
    "in particular , if it is as high as @xmath101 , then a supernova remnant will radiate its energy extremely rapidly , before the ejecta have time to thermalize @xcite . in this case",
    ", the fraction of energy radiated as bremsstrahlung is very much higher ( @xmath102 ) , as is the characteristic temperature ( @xmath103 ) .",
    "we examine both of these models in section  [ res ] , with the understanding that the true picture lies somewhere in between .",
    "in addition to this thermal emission , supernova remnants also produce non - thermal x - rays .",
    "these are generated as the relativistic electrons produced by the snr gradually lose energy through synchrotron radiation , non - thermal bremsstrahlung and the inverse compton scattering of photons from the cosmic microwave background . at high redshift ,",
    "the latter is likely to dominate @xcite .",
    "the spectrum of the resulting emission depends upon the energy spectrum of the relativistic electrons , but at the energies of interest is well represented by a power law : @xmath104 .",
    "the intensity of the emission depends upon the fraction of the supernova energy transferred to the electrons ; this is not well constrained , with estimates ranging from 0.1% to 10% .",
    "accordingly , we model the emission as @xmath105 where @xmath87 , @xmath106 is the fraction of energy deposited in the electrons , and where we have assumed that @xmath97 and @xmath107 as in the thermal bremsstrahlung case .",
    "this expression assumes a high - energy cutoff for the x - ray spectrum at @xmath73 but is only logarithmically dependent on the value of this cutoff . in section  [ res ] , we examine results for models with @xmath108 and @xmath109 , which bracket the range of plausible values .    much more detail on high redshift inverse compton emission , including a discussion of potential observational tests , is given in @xcite .",
    "the opacity @xmath13 can be separated into two distinct components  absorption by dust and gas within the emitting protogalaxy , which we term intrinsic absorption , and absorption by gas along the line of sight through the igm .",
    "intrinsic absorption is difficult to model with any degree of accuracy as it depends upon a number of variables  the size and shape of the galaxy , its ionization state , the position of the sources within it , the dust content etc . rather than attempt to model these in detail  a significant undertaking in itself  we instead adopt a highly approximate representation .",
    "we assume that the emitted x - rays are attenuated by absorption by a neutral hydrogen column density of @xmath110 plus an associated neutral helium column density @xmath111 .",
    "this absorption is assumed to be the same for all sources .",
    "these values are chosen because they are representative of the column densities of the protogalaxies studied in this paper ( which presumably contain the bulk of the x - ray sources ) .",
    "reducing @xmath112 ( as would be appropriate if much of the surrounding were photoionized and/or dispersed by the progenitors of the x - ray sources ) has little or no effect on @xmath32 , as gas in the igm and within the protogalaxy itself quickly come to dominate the total absorption .",
    "increasing @xmath112 , on the other hand , has more significant effects : an order of magnitude increase in @xmath112 produces similar results to an order of magnitude decrease in the strength of the x - ray background , which , as we will see in section  [ res ] , is generally sufficient to render x - ray feedback ineffective .",
    "consequently , we will overestimate the effect of the background if the bulk of the x - ray sources reside within massive galaxies .    turning to the lyman - werner bands",
    ", we note that intrinsic absorption will generally be negligible within small protogalaxies , as their @xmath0 content is rapidly photodissociated @xcite .",
    "moreover , we also assume that the effects of dust absorption are negligible . in galaxies of primordial composition",
    ", this is obviously true ; in metal - poor galaxies , it should also be a good approximation , as very large column densities are required for significant dust obscuration ( for instance , @xmath113 for @xmath114 gas , if the dust - to - gas ratio is similar to that in the milky way ) .",
    "again , these assumptions break down if the majority of sources are to be found in massive , metal - rich galaxies , but we expect such galaxies to be extremely rare at the redshifts of interest in this paper .    compared to intrinsic absorption , the effects of absorption due to the igm are much simpler to treat , particularly if we can assume that the bulk of the gas remains at an approximately uniform density .",
    "this assumption proves reasonable at high redshift for photons with mean free paths much greater than the typical clumping scale , as is the case for both lyman - werner band photons and x - rays .",
    "our treatment of igm absorption is discussed in the following sections .",
    "the continuum opacity of metal - free gas is very small @xcite and for our purposes can be neglected .",
    "consequently , the only significant sources of opacity encountered by lyman - werner photons are absorption by the lyman series lines of neutral hydrogen , and by the lyman - werner lines of molecular hydrogen .",
    "the lyman series lines have the effect of absorbing any lyman - werner photons of the same frequency , and reprocessing them to lyman-@xmath84 photons plus associated softer photons .",
    "as lyman-@xmath84 lies outside of the lyman - werner band , the net effect is to block from view any sources at redshifts higher than some maximum , @xmath115 , given by @xmath116 where @xmath117 is the frequency of the appropriate lyman series line and @xmath9 and @xmath8 are the observed frequency and redshift . clearly , the size of @xmath115 depends upon the distance between @xmath9 and @xmath117 , and thus more sources are seen at frequencies that are a long way from a line . as a result ,",
    "the spectrum develops a characteristic ` sawtooth ' shape ( see figure 1 in @xcite ) , with the effect becoming more pronounced as one nears the lyman limit .",
    "absorption by molecular hydrogen is rather more complicated , due to the large number of lyman - werner lines that contribute to the opacity . if we approximate the lines as delta functions then an individual line produces an opacity @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 are the oscillator strength and wavelength of the transition , @xmath121 is the number density of @xmath0 molecules in the level giving rise to the line at @xmath122 , the redshift of absorption , and @xmath123 is the hubble constant at @xmath122 .",
    "the value of @xmath122 is given by @xmath124 where @xmath125 .",
    "if we assume that all of the photons that are absorbed in the lines are permanently removed from the lyman - werner band , then the total opacity @xmath13 is simply given by the sum over all lines with @xmath126 : @xmath127 this sum potentially involves a very large number of lines , but can be greatly simplified by assuming that all of the @xmath0 is to be found in its ortho or para ground state ; at the redshifts of interest , the population of excited states will be negligible .",
    "in deriving this expression , we have assumed that every absorption permanently removes a lyman - werner band photon .",
    "this is not entirely correct . on average ,",
    "only 15% of absorptions are followed by photodissociation of the @xmath0 molecule @xcite ; the rest of the time , the molecule decays back to a bound state , emitting a photon . in their treatment of this problem",
    ", @xcite assumed that the excited @xmath0 molecule would always decay directly back into the original state , and would thus emit a photon of the same energy as the one initially absorbed .",
    "in fact , this is not correct ( t.  abel , private communication ) ; most decays occur initially to highly excited vibrational states , producing photons redwards of the lyman - werner bands .",
    "only a small fraction of decays ( about 5% ) take place directly into the original state , while a slightly larger fraction ( about 15% ) produce photons that lie elsewhere in the lyman - werner band system @xcite .",
    "we do not include the effect of these photons , however ; an accurate treatment would be quite complicated and is almost certainly unnecessary  as we shall see in section  [ res ] , @xmath0 in the igm is rapidly destroyed by the growing lyman - werner background and is completely negligible by the time that negative feedback begins .      at x - ray energies ,",
    "the opacity of the intergalactic gas is dominated by the ionization of neutral hydrogen and helium ; prior to recombination , the @xmath128 abundance is small and can be neglected .",
    "the x - ray opacity can thus be written as @xmath129 \\frac{{\\,{\\rm d}l}}{{\\,{\\rm d}z } } { \\,{\\rm d}z},\\ ] ] where @xmath130 and where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the absorption cross - sections of neutral hydrogen and helium respectively , with @xmath133 and @xmath134 being the corresponding number densities .",
    "as long as the fractional ionization of the igm remains small ( i.e. a few percent or less ) , the ratio between @xmath135 to @xmath136 can be accurately approximated by its primordial value @xmath137 where @xmath138 is the helium mass fraction , and we can write equation  [ tauigm ] purely in terms of @xmath136 as @xmath139 n_{{\\rm{h } } }   \\frac{{\\,{\\rm d}l}}{{\\,{\\rm d}z } } { \\,{\\rm d}z}.\\ ] ] this integral is readily computable by means of numerical integration .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that , given a simple star formation model , it is relatively easy to calculate the evolution of the lyman - werner and x - ray backgrounds .",
    "two of the parameters of our star formation model  the star formation efficiency @xmath24 and starburst lifetime @xmath22",
    " we treat as free parameters ( although they can be constrained to some extent  see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the remaining parameter , @xmath32 , the temperature at which efficient cooling becomes possible , is determined by the strength of the backgrounds themselves . this clearly presents us with a problem : the evolution of @xmath32 is coupled to that of the backgrounds , and to know one we must first know the other .    fortunately , this difficulty is easily avoided .",
    "we know that at high redshift the number of protogalaxies , and hence the star formation rate , must be very small .",
    "consequently , there must be some redshift above which the external radiation field will become too weak to affect galaxy formation .",
    "the precise redshift at which this occurs is model dependent , but for the models examined in this paper we typically find that radiative feedback is negligible above @xmath140 . by choosing an initial redshift @xmath141 ,",
    "therefore , we can be sure that in our initial simulation the background radiation will have no effect .",
    "given this starting point , we next proceed incrementally to lower redshifts via the following procedure :    1 .",
    "given @xmath142 , we calculate the background radiation field at @xmath143 , assuming that @xmath144 .",
    "2 .   using the computed background",
    ", we simulate the chemical and thermal evolution of a protogalaxy with @xmath145 ; the details of this simulation are outlined in sections  [ comp ] to [ halt ] below .",
    "the main aim of this simulation is to determine whether the protogalactic gas can cool efficiently .",
    "if the protogalactic gas cools , then our assumed value of @xmath32 is correct ; we store this result , and return to step one to proceed to the next redshift . if the gas fails to cool , we continue to step four .",
    "we increment our assumed value of @xmath146 by a small amount @xmath147 , and recalculate the background radiation field .",
    "we assume that @xmath32 varies linearly over @xmath148 .",
    "given the new background , we return to step two .",
    "provided that @xmath148 and @xmath147 are both small , the error in @xmath146 will also be small ; this is particularly the case once emission from larger protogalaxies ( which cool via lyman-@xmath84 radiation ) begins to dominate the background .",
    "this approach reduces the coupled problem to the simpler one of determining whether a protogalaxy with virial temperature @xmath149 and formation redshift @xmath150 will cool when exposed to a particular background radiation field . to answer this question",
    ", we need to be able to model the thermal and chemical evolution of the protogalaxy .",
    "our approach to this problem is outlined in the following sections .",
    "ideally , we would like to use a high - resolution hydrodynamical simulation to follow the thermal and chemical evolution of the protogalactic gas ( see , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "unfortunately , including the effects of radiative transfer , particularly of photons in the lyman - werner bands , into such a simulation is not currently feasible .",
    "we are thus forced to approximate . in choosing an appropriate approximation ,",
    "we are also motivated by the desire to minimize the computational requirements of our simulations , so that we can explore the effects of a variety of different source models .",
    "we make three main approximations :    1 .",
    "we assume spherical symmetry .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the first generation of protogalaxies , but clearly is incorrect in detail ( see , e.g.  figure 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "we assume that the protogalactic gas is _",
    "static _ , at least on the timescale of the simulation .",
    "this allows us to ignore the hydrodynamical evolution of the gas , and also substantially simplifies the treatment of radiative transfer .",
    "this assumption clearly breaks down once the gas begins to cool strongly and loses its pressure support , but as we are only interested in the evolution up to this point , this is not a significant problem .",
    "we assume that all of the @xmath0 molecules remain in the rotational and vibrational ground state , in either ortho or para form .",
    "this simplification allows us to evolve the chemistry and radiative transfer on the timescale on which the total @xmath0 abundance changes ( typically @xmath151 ",
    "@xmath152 ) rather than that on which the individual level populations change ( @xmath153  @xmath154 ) .",
    "it also simplifies our treatment of the radiative transfer .",
    "we discuss this approximation in more detail in section  [ pd ] .",
    "together , these approximations allow us to solve for the chemical and thermal evolution of a model protogalaxy in a matter of minutes on a fast desktop computer .",
    "this allows us to study the redshift evolution of @xmath32 at high resolution in both temperature and redshift and for a number of different x - ray source models .",
    "however , this approach has an obvious drawback  we can not be sure that our approximations give a fair representation of the real protogalaxy . of particular concern",
    "is the neglect of the hydrodynamic evolution of the gas , and the consequent error in the density profile .",
    "this is potentially significant because the @xmath0 cooling rate , along with many of the chemical reaction rates , scales as the square of the density .",
    "small errors in the density can thus lead to larger ones in the computed temperature .",
    "these concerns are mitigated to some extent , however , by the close agreement between the results of detailed numerical simulations and previous semi - analytic treatments .",
    "for instance , the values of @xmath32 obtained from the smoothed - particle hydrodynamics simulations of @xcite agree well with the results of @xcite , despite the highly approximate uniform density profile adopted by the latter group .",
    "similarly , the results of @xcite , obtained with a three - dimensional adaptive mesh hydrodynamical code broadly agree with those of @xcite , who use a static model similar to that presented here .",
    "together , these results suggest that @xmath32 is insensitive to the precise details of the density profile , but clearly this remains an area of concern .",
    "our computational method can be broken down into three main stages  initialization of the density profile and the chemical abundances , computation of the thermal and chemical evolution of the gas , and termination of the simulation at a suitable point .",
    "these are described below .",
    "the protogalactic density profile is modeled as a truncated isothermal sphere , with central overdensity @xmath155 and truncation radius @xmath156 the virial temperature and redshift of formation of the protogalaxy completely specify its density profile .",
    "we subdivide this profile into @xmath157 spherical shells of uniform thickness and compute the mean density within each shell .",
    "we have run a number of test simulations with different values of @xmath157 , and find that setting @xmath158 provides sufficient spatial resolution to accurately determine @xmath32 .",
    "we assume that the initial chemical composition of the protogalactic gas is the same as that of the intergalactic medium . at our initial redshift @xmath159",
    ", we take this from @xcite . at lower redshifts ,",
    "the chemical evolution of the igm is influenced by the lyman - werner and x - ray backgrounds .",
    "we therefore calculate the intergalactic abundances explicitly , using the chemical model outlined in section  [ chem ] , by solving the chemical rate equations : @xmath160 where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are source and sink terms for @xmath163 .",
    "at the same time we also solve for the temperature of the intergalactic gas @xcite @xmath164 where @xmath165 is the hubble constant , @xmath166 is the total particle number density and where @xmath167 and @xmath168 are the net heating and cooling rates ( see section  [ cool ] ) .",
    "we solve this set of ordinary differential equations with the stifbs integrator of @xcite .",
    "as the size of the required timestep is generally much smaller than the redshift interval @xmath148 that separates our individual determinations of @xmath32 , we compute intermediate values by interpolation and from these determine the strength of the radiation background and hence the photochemical rates .",
    "although our main aim in following this chemistry is to determine the correct initial abundances for our simulations of protogalactic evolution , the results are of interest in their own right and are presented and discussed in section  [ ther_chem ] .",
    "our treatment of the chemistry of the igm does not include the effects of the ionizing photons from stars ( and/or quasars ) that are ultimately responsible for the reionization of the intergalactic gas .",
    "this is justified at early epochs , as these photons are confined within small regions surrounding the luminous sources , but this simplification restricts the validity of our results to the period prior to cosmological reionization .",
    "the post - reionization epoch , and the effect of reionization on galaxy formation , have received extensive study elsewhere ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .      to simulate the chemical evolution of the protogalactic gas , we adopt a chemical model consisting of thirty reactions between nine species : @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath128 , @xmath173 , @xmath0 , @xmath174 and free electrons .",
    "the reactions included in the model are summarized in table  [ chemtab ] , together with the source(s ) of the data used .",
    "this model is based in large part on that of @xcite , but has been modified to improve its accuracy when applied to optically thick gas . aside from a number of updates to the reaction coefficients in the light of new data , the main differences are as follows :    1 .",
    "we include the contribution to the hydrogen ionization rate arising from the ionizing photons produced by @xmath128 recombination , in line with the discussion in chapter 2 of @xcite .",
    "although commonly a small correction to the total rate , this can become significant when x - ray photoionization dominates .",
    "2 .   to enable us to accurately determine the @xmath128 abundance",
    ", we find that we need to include the effects of charge transfer between @xmath128 and @xmath169 ( reaction 20 ) , as this can be comparable to the recombination rate when the fractional ionization is small . for completeness",
    "we also include the inverse reaction ( no .",
    "21 ) , although this is unimportant at @xmath175 .",
    "we include the contribution to the ionization rates of hydrogen and helium arising from secondary ionization by energetic photoelectrons , based on the recent calculations of @xcite .",
    "the contribution of secondary ionization to the other photoionization rates is small and can be neglected .",
    "4 .   we do not include the photodissociation of @xmath0 by photons above the lyman limit ( reaction 28 in @xcite ) , as in optically thick gas this will be negligible compared to the effects of @xmath0 photoionization ( reaction 26 ) . on the other hand , we do include the effects of dissociative photoionization ( reaction 27 ) , which becomes significant for photon energies greater than 30@xmath176 .",
    "more information about all of these points , and the chemical model generally , can be found in @xcite .",
    ".a list of the reactions included in our chemical model of protogalactic gas .",
    "values for the rate coefficients ( or radiative cross - sections where appropriate ) are given in @xcite .",
    "references are to the primary source(s ) of the data whenever possible ; in many cases , we have also used analytical fits to this data from @xcite , @xcite or @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < \" , ]      given the initial temperature and chemical abundances , plus the set of chemical reaction rates , actually solving for the thermal and chemical evolution is relatively easy .",
    "as in the igm case , we simply solve the coupled set of chemical rate equations @xmath160 @xmath177 using the stifbs integrator of @xcite .    at the start of each timestep ( hereafter time @xmath178 ) , we compute the photochemical rates as outlined in sections  [ rtmethod ]",
    ". we then use stifbs to solve for the new chemical abundances and new temperature at the end of the timestep ( time @xmath179 ) , repeating this for each shell in turn .",
    "we next store these values , return to time @xmath178 , and recalculate them using the same procedure , but with _ two _ timesteps of length @xmath180 .",
    "we recalculate the photochemical rates at the intermediate point .",
    "we next test for convergence by comparing our two sets of results .",
    "if any of the chemical abundances or temperatures of any of the shells differ by more than 0.1% , then we reject the results and begin again from time @xmath178 with a smaller timestep .",
    "otherwise , we check to see whether we need to halt the simulation , using the criteria discussed below , and , if we do not , we begin the computations for a new timestep starting from @xmath179 .",
    "one final approximation that we find useful in practice is to fix the @xmath170 and @xmath174 abundances at their equilibrium values .",
    "this allows the integrator to take much larger timesteps than would otherwise be possible , but introduces very little error into the computed @xmath0 abundances .      using the method outlined in the preceding sections , we compute the chemical and thermal evolution of the protogalaxy until one of two conditions is met : either the protogalactic gas begins to cool strongly , or we exceed a preset time limit , @xmath181 .    to assess whether gas cooling is ` strong '",
    "enough requires an objective cooling criterion .",
    "a number of different possibilities have been suggested in the literature @xcite . in our simulations",
    ", we adopt the criterion used by @xcite : we require that the elapsed time exceeds the cooling time , as computed at the edge of the protogalactic core , at a distance @xmath182 from the centre of the protogalaxy .",
    "the advantage of this choice is that it avoids giving us a false positive result in cases where @xmath183 drops briefly below @xmath184 at early times , but remains so for a time @xmath185 . as an additional sanity check",
    ", we also require that the final temperature be smaller than the initial temperature .",
    "if the protogalactic gas does not cool strongly , then the simulation will terminate when it reaches @xmath181 .",
    "this pre - set time limit is required on purely practical grounds , to prevent simulations in which the gas does not cool from running for excessive amounts of time , but also has a physical justification . in our simulations ,",
    "we treat protogalaxies as isolated objects , uninfluenced by external events . in reality , they are part of a dynamically evolving mass distribution , and the majority will only survive for a limited time before merging with other protogalaxies of a similar or larger size .",
    "it is possible to use the press - schechter formalism to calculate the distribution of survival times as a function of mass @xcite , but for rare objects the mean survival time is typically of the order of the hubble time and thus for simplicity we set @xmath186 .",
    "in the following sections , we present results from a number of simulations that examine the effects of the x - ray backgrounds produced by the various source models discussed in sections  [ def_xray ] and [ alt_xray ] . unless otherwise noted ,",
    "all of these simulations assume the same parameters for the star formation model : a standard salpeter imf , with @xmath187 and @xmath188 , a star formation efficiency @xmath189 and a starburst lifetime @xmath190 .",
    "additionally , all of the simulations use the same cosmological model , the @xmath168cdm concordance model of @xcite , which has parameters @xmath191 .      before examining the effect of an x - ray background on protogalactic evolution , we first briefly study the evolution of @xmath32 in its absence . as well as allowing us to determine the sensitivity of our results to variations in the uv source model , this also provides us with a necessary baseline against which to compare our other results .    in figure  [ baseline ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath32 with redshift for the three different star formation models discussed in section  [ uvdensity ] .",
    "all three models assume a salpeter imf , with maximum stellar mass @xmath51 , as well as our standard star formation efficiency , starburst lifetime and cosmological model , described previously .",
    "our basic model assumes a metal - free stellar population , with a minimum stellar mass of @xmath187 ; the corresponding results are given by the dotted line in figure  [ baseline ] .",
    "the dashed line illustrates the effect of increasing the minimum mass to @xmath50 ; the solid line assumes the same @xmath53 , together with a metallicity @xmath57 .",
    "figure  [ baseline ] demonstrates that although the strength of the lyman - werner background increases by almost a factor of five as we move from our basic model to the metal - enriched model , this has less effect on @xmath32 than we might expect : the difference in @xmath32 between the three models is never more than 50% , and the qualitative details of its evolution are very similar in all three models .",
    "this suggests that the uncertainty introduced by our lack of knowledge of the properties of the primordial stellar population need not be unduly limiting .",
    "however , it is also clear that some uncertainty remains , and this will place a lower limit on the magnitude of any effect that we can reliably claim to detect , as small variations in @xmath32 due to the x - ray background will be swamped the by the error resulting from the uncertainty in the lyman - werner background .    in the work that follows ,",
    "we take as our baseline the results of our basic , metal - free , low @xmath53 model ; as figure  [ baseline ] demonstrates , this minimizes the strength of the lyman - werner background , and thus will tend to maximize the effectiveness of the x - ray background .      in figure  [ base_xray ] , we plot the evolution of @xmath32 in the presence of the x - ray background generated by the massive x - ray binary model described in section  [ def_xray ] . for the purposes of comparison",
    ", we also plot the results of our basic x - ray free model .",
    "initially , the evolution of @xmath32 is the same in both models , implying that the x - ray background has little or no effect on the gas . at a redshift @xmath192 and critical temperature @xmath193",
    ", however , the models begin to diverge significantly . in the x - ray free model , the critical temperature continues to increase rapidly until it reaches its maximum value of @xmath194 . in the x - ray binary model , by contrast ,",
    "the rate of increase of @xmath32 is significantly slower , and it fails to reach its maximum value by the end of the simulation at @xmath195 .   because at lower redshift we expect the effects of ionizing radiation from both stellar sources and quasars to become increasingly important and thus our results to become unreliable .",
    "clearly if reionization occurs at @xmath196 , the same is true for some portion of the results plotted here . ]",
    "it is clear from figure  [ base_xray ] that the presence of the x - ray background significantly affects the evolution of gas in the larger of the @xmath0-cooled protogalaxies . in small protogalaxies , on the other hand ,",
    "the negative feedback caused by the lyman - werner background remains as strong as ever .    a simple way to judge",
    "the importance of this effect is to examine the difference it makes to the fraction of gas in the universe that can collapse and cool . as we saw in section  [ sfr ] , we can use the press - schechter formalism to express the cool gas fraction as @xmath39.\\ ] ] using the relationship between @xmath43 and @xmath32 derived in that section , it is straightforward to calculate the evolution of @xmath45 in both the x - ray binary and x - ray free models .",
    "to better highlight the difference between the two models , we plot in figure  [ fcoll ] the ratio of the cooled gas fraction in the x - ray binary model to that in the x - ray free model . at high redshift ,",
    "the evolution of @xmath32 is the same in both models , and thus the ratio is one .",
    "below @xmath197 , the behaviour of the models begins to diverge , but this has little effect on the ratio until the models begin to diverge sharply at @xmath198 .",
    "thereafter , the ratio rises sharply to a peak at @xmath199 , and subsequently declines as the growth in the cooled mass fraction becomes dominated by the formation of larger protogalaxies that cool via lyman-@xmath84 emission .",
    "figure  [ fcoll ] shows us that by ignoring the effect of the x - ray background we underestimate @xmath45 by at most a factor of two .",
    "in fact , the difference is likely to be even smaller : we have assumed that all of the gas in a protogalaxy with @xmath200 will cool , but this need not be the case if an x - ray background is present , as x - ray heating will prevent gas from cooling in the low - density outer layers of the protogalaxy . whether this will affect the star formation rate within individual protogalaxies is not clear , but in any case the difference in the globally - averaged star formation rate is unlikely to be greater than a factor of two .",
    "note , however , that this extra star formation occurs entirely in low - mass systems , from which ionizing photons @xcite and supernova ejecta @xcite can more readily escape .",
    "doubling the star formation rate may thus significantly increase the feedback of primordial star formation on the igm .    finally , given the uncertainties in the data underlying our simple massive x - ray binary model ( see section  [ def_xray ] ) , it is of interest to investigate the sensitivity of our results to changes in the strength of the x - ray background .",
    "accordingly , we have run additional simulations in which the strength of the x - ray sources was increased or decreased by a factor of ten .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  [ alt_norm ] , together with the results of our basic x - ray binary model and of the x - ray free model .    unsurprisingly ,",
    "increasing or decreasing the strength of the x - ray background alters the evolution of @xmath32 . decreasing it by an order of magnitude increases @xmath32 to the point where its evolution is little different from that in the x - ray free model .",
    "increasing it by an order of magnitude , on the other hand , systematically lowers @xmath32 , although never by more than a factor of two .",
    "as we discussed in section  [ alt_xray ] , it is possible that massive x - ray binaries are much less abundant at high redshift than at the present day .",
    "if so , then the x - ray emission of star - forming galaxies will be dominated by supernova remnants ( snr ) .",
    "these will generate x - rays through two main emission mechanisms : thermal bremsstrahlung from hot gas , and inverse compton scattering of the cmb by relativistic electrons .",
    "we consider the effects of these mechanisms separately .",
    "we examined two possible variants of the thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "in one , we assumed that the characteristics of the emission are broadly the same as those observed locally , with a fraction @xmath99 of the supernova energy being radiated as x - rays with a characteristic temperature @xmath201 @xcite .",
    "in the other model , we assumed that all high - redshift supernovae explode in extremely dense surroundings , producing x - ray bright , ultra - compact remnants with @xmath202 and @xmath203 @xcite .",
    "realistic models should lie somewhere between these two extremes .",
    "however , we found that in neither of these cases does the x - ray background affect the evolution of @xmath32 : at our level of temperature resolution , the results are identical to those obtained for the x - ray free model .",
    "the obvious conclusion is that the background produced by bremsstrahlung is simply too weak to be effective .",
    "our inverse compton model fares somewhat better . in this model ,",
    "the strength of the x - ray background is proportional to the mean fraction @xmath106 of the supernova explosion energy that is transferred to relativistic electrons within the remnant .",
    "this value is not known accurately and so we considered two possible cases , one with @xmath108 and another with @xmath109 , these being conservative lower and upper bounds on the true value . in the former case , we again saw no significant effect on the evolution of @xmath32 . in the latter case ,",
    "on the other hand , we saw results very similar to those obtained for the x - ray binary model , as illustrated in figure  [ sn_ic ] .    in principle , therefore , inverse compton emission from supernova remnants could be as important an x - ray source as emission from x - ray binaries .",
    "ultimately , however , its importance depends upon the value of @xmath106 , and no firm conclusions are possible until this value is better constrained . in this context , the possible observational tests suggested by @xcite could prove extremely valuable .",
    "as well as determining the evolution of @xmath32 , our simulations also allow us to study the thermal and chemical evolution of the diffuse intergalactic medium , as outlined in section  [ model_pg ] . as a simple example , we plot in figure  [ h2_in_igm ] the evolution of the fractional @xmath0 abundance in the igm for the x - ray free model ( solid line ) and the x - ray binary model ( dashed line ) .",
    "in both cases , the fractional abundance rapidly decreases from its primordial value due to photodissociation by the ultraviolet background , reaching @xmath204 by @xmath205 .",
    "subsequently , its decline slows , in part because the rate of increase in the strength of the ultraviolet background also slows .",
    "below @xmath206 , the behaviour of the two models diverges . in the x - ray free model",
    ", @xmath207 continues to decline until the end of the simulation . in the x - ray binary model ,",
    "on the other hand , the increasing ionization of the igm boosts the @xmath0 formation rate to the point where it overtakes the photodissociation rate and the @xmath0 abundance , after reaching a minimum at @xmath208 , begins to climb .",
    "nevertheless , it remains extremely small at the end of the simulation , readily justifying our assertion in section  [ lwabs ] that absorption by intergalactic @xmath0 does not play a significant role in determining the strength of the lyman - werner background .    in figure  [ igm_ion ]",
    ", we plot the evolution of the fractional ionization of the igm . in the x - ray free model ,",
    "this remains approximately constant over the lifetime of the simulation , as the recombination timescale is significantly longer than the hubble time . in the x - ray binary model , on the other hand , photoionization by the growing x - ray background",
    "eventually overcomes the very small recombination rate and drives the fractional ionization upwards , increasing it by just over an order of magnitude by the end of the simulation .",
    "even so , it remains small , demonstrating that the x - ray background does not contribute significantly to cosmological reionization .",
    "the effect on the fractional ionization of helium ( the ratio of @xmath128 to @xmath172 ) is rather more striking .",
    "the post - recombination @xmath128 abundance is extremely small @xcite , and in the x - ray free model remains at this low level throughout the simulation . in the x - ray binary model , on the other hand ,",
    "it increases dramatically over the course of the simulation , reaching @xmath209 by @xmath38 .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ igm_heion ] .",
    "finally , in figure  [ igm_heat ] we plot the evolution with redshift of the temperature of the igm . in the x - ray free model ,",
    "adiabatic cooling dominates the thermal evolution , and the temperature falls off approximately as @xmath210 . in the x - ray binary model , on the other hand , photo - electric heating begins to heat the igm strongly at @xmath211 , driving the temperature up to @xmath212 by the end of the simulation .",
    "thus , although the x - ray background does not contribute significantly to the reionization of the igm , it does produce substantial reheating prior to reionization .",
    "moreover , given the large mean free path of the x - ray photons , this reheating occurs almost uniformly throughout the igm , rather than being localized to the vicinity of star - forming galaxies .",
    "one consequence of this reheating is that the formation of very small - scale structure will be suppressed , as the increased temperature of the igm leads to an increased jeans mass .",
    "this is unlikely to affect the global star formation rate , however , as star formation within these small structures would in any case be strongly suppressed by the ultraviolet background .",
    "nevertheless , it will reduce the mean clumping factor of the igm below the level that we would otherwise predict , which may in turn speed up reionization @xcite .",
    "reheating also affects the visibility of the igm in the redshifted @xmath213 line of neutral hydrogen .",
    "@xcite show that scattered lyman-@xmath84 emission from high redshift galaxies efficiently couples the spin temperature of the hyperfine levels to the kinetic temperature of the gas . if the gas temperature is smaller than the cmb temperature , this results in @xmath213 line absorption ; if it is greater , then it results in emission .",
    "absorption is easier to detect than emission @xcite , but the heating produced by the x - ray background implies that absorption occurs only at @xmath214 , and that concentrating on detecting @xmath213 emission may be the more viable strategy .",
    "the results of the previous section allow us to assess the impact of the high redshift x - ray background that is produced by star - forming galaxies .",
    "if we assume that the x - ray emission of these galaxies is similar to that observed locally , and that the same correlation between x - ray luminosity and star formation rate applies , then we find that the background produced is strong enough to partially offset the effects of uv photodissociation in large ( @xmath215 ) , @xmath0-cooled protogalaxies .    however , local emission is dominated by massive x - ray binaries , which may not form in large numbers at high redshift .",
    "therefore , we have also explored the effect of an x - ray background produced by emission from supernova remnants .",
    "if this emission is dominated by inverse compton scattering and if the fraction of the supernova energy transferred to the relativistic electrons powering this emission is large , then the resulting background has very similar effects to one produced by x - ray binaries . on the other hand , if the fraction of energy transferred is small , then the background has little or no effect .",
    "in addition to inverse compton emission , we have also examined the effect of thermal bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas in the remnants , and find that even if all supernovae were to form x - ray bright , ultra - compact remnants , the resulting x - ray background would still be too weak to significantly affect protogalactic evolution .    finally , none of these models produces an x - ray background that is strong enough to balance uv photodissociation in small protogalaxies , with virial temperatures @xmath216 . in these protogalaxies , negative feedback always dominates .",
    "how significant are these results ?",
    "one simple way to assess this is to study the evolution of the mass fraction of cooled gas , which represents the total amount of matter available to form stars . comparing its evolution in the x - ray binary model to that in the absence of an x - ray background",
    ", we find that it is increased by approximately a factor of two .",
    "given our star formation model , this corresponds to an increase in the global star formation rate by the same amount .",
    "however , this is small compared to the order of magnitude increase that would result if we were simply to ignore the effect of the uv background ( see figure 7 of * ? ? ? * ) .    in reality",
    ", the difference between the two models may be greater than this because the additional star formation takes place entirely in low - mass systems , from which ionizing photons and supernova - produced metals can readily escape @xcite .",
    "doubling the star formation rate may therefore have more than double the impact on the intergalactic medium . however , to properly assess the ultimate importance of this effect requires more detailed modelling , beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "ultimately , understanding the history of star formation in the small protogalaxies studied in this paper remains important even if they do not contribute to the reionization or enrichment of the igm to any great degree .",
    "this is simply because , in a hierarchical universe , these protogalaxies are the building blocks from which larger galaxies form and therefore set the initial conditions for later stages of galaxy formation . in particular , very little metal enrichment of the primordial gas is required in order to allow the cno cycle to operate and population ii ( rather than population iii ) stars to form , and yet this can have a profound effect on the predicted spectral energy distribution of an early stellar population .",
    "although the main purpose of our study was to examine the effects of the x - ray background on the thermal and chemical evolution of gas within protogalaxies , our approach also allows us to examine the effects of the background on the diffuse igm .",
    "our main results are three - fold :    1 .",
    "we confirm the rapid destruction of @xmath0 in the intergalactic medium noted by @xcite , but also show that when an x - ray background is present the @xmath0 abundance does not continue to decline indefinitely , but eventually stabilizes and may even begin to increase .",
    "however , it never becomes large enough to significantly affect the lyman - werner background .",
    "we show that although photoionization by the x - ray background significantly increases the fractional ionization of the igm ( and in particular the fractional ionization of helium ) , the bulk of the gas remains mostly neutral , demonstrating that the contribution of the x - ray background to cosmological reionization is small .",
    "we find that the x - ray background will also heat the intergalactic gas , raising its temperature to @xmath217 by @xmath38 ( compared to @xmath218 in the x - ray free model ) .",
    "this will suppress the formation of structure on the smallest scales by increasing the jeans mass .",
    "it is unlikely to affect the global star formation rate , since @xmath219 , but may speed up the process of reionization by reducing the mean clumping factor of the igm .",
    "a number of other authors have studied the effects of radiative feedback on the formation of @xmath0-cooled protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have concentrated solely on the effects of the lyman - werner background , generally finding that it suppresses cooling ( and hence star formation ) by @xmath19830 , prior to cosmological reionization .",
    "our x - ray free simulations support this conclusion .",
    "in particular , comparison with the results of @xcite , who use a very similar method but with a different implementation of radiative transfer , gas chemistry and cooling , shows good agreement .",
    "rather less work has been done on the effects of the high redshift x - ray background .",
    "@xcite examined the formation of molecular hydrogen in a constant density primordial cloud illuminated by a power - law uv spectrum extending into the hard x - rays , and found that in some cases , the background could enhance @xmath0 formation .",
    "this lead @xcite to examine the effects of a quasar - produced x - ray background , using a very simple model in which the x - ray flux is a fixed fraction of the lyman - werner band flux , modulated by absorption by a fixed column density of @xmath169 and @xmath172 .",
    "they found that an x - ray to uv flux ratio of 10% was enough to overcome negative feedback , and that a higher flux ratio could potentially produce positive feedback .",
    "recently , @xcite have studied the effects of similar model backgrounds using an adaptive - mesh hydrodynamics code .",
    "they also find that x - rays reduce the effectiveness of negative feedback , but that the latter still dominates .",
    "they do not find evidence for the positive feedback predicted by @xcite .",
    "however , their simulations do not include the effects of @xmath0 self - shielding , and thus potentially underestimate the amount of @xmath0 that forms ( although see * ? ? ? * for a different view ) .",
    "there are several significant differences between our work and these previous investigations .",
    "firstly , we do not assume a fixed spectrum or intensity for the x - ray background ; rather , we specify the properties of the x - ray _ sources _ and subsequently compute the build - up of the background in a self - consistent fashion .",
    "moreover , we consider source models where the x - ray emission is proportional to the star formation rate , as is observed to be the case for star - forming galaxies at low redshift ; the relationship between star formation rate and x - ray emission in quasar - based models is far less clear . as a result , we generally consider x - ray backgrounds signficantly fainter than those studied in the papers cited above .",
    "this makes direct comparison of our results difficult .",
    "however , we note that @xcite find x - ray feedback to be ineffective below @xmath220 , regardless of the strength of the x - ray background ; at the redshifts they consider , this corresponds to a virial temperature @xmath221 , and thus agrees well with the similar result obtained in this paper .    in closing",
    ", we note that a number of uncertainties still remain in our treatment of this problem .",
    "some of these  the high redshift star formation rate or the appropriate population iii initial mass function , for instance  we simply do not know at the present time .",
    "fortunately , changes to our assumed values can be readily incorporated in the framework laid out in this paper .",
    "other uncertainties arise from our method of simulation ; in particular , from our assumption of a static density profile for the protogalactic gas .",
    "we hope to address these issues in future work .",
    "the authors would like to acknowledge detailed comments by the anonymous referee which helped to significantly improve this paper .",
    "scog would also like to acknowledge useful discussions on various aspects of this work with tom abel , omar almaini , rennan barkana , marie machacek and si peng oh .",
