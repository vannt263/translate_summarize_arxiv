    "dark energy and dark matter appear as two of the most important questions of modern cosmology .",
    "many models trying to answer these questions involve scalar fields . in particular , to explain the behavior of dark energy , quintessence models @xcite consider scalar fields with potentials dominating today , giving birth to a negative pressure .",
    "but dark matter can also be explained through scalar fields , as in boson star models @xcite or scalar field dark matter models @xcite .",
    "a unification of dark matter and dark energy can also be performed into a dark fluid @xcite , which can again be modeled with a dark fluid scalar field @xcite .",
    "thus , scalar fields are involved in many cosmological models .",
    "+ one of the main difficulties to build scalar field - based models is the choice of a potential .",
    "the usual way to deal with scalar fields in cosmology is to consider them as classical , and to study their evolution .",
    "however , it is known that quantum fluctuations could modify the potential .",
    "+ in this paper , we study the alterations of real or complex scalar field potentials due to quantum corrections .",
    "we focus on the one - loop quantum corrections to the original potentials , while computing effective potentials . we will therefore be able to test the validity of several dark energy , dark matter and dark fluid potentials .",
    "a similar study has been performed on several quintessence real scalar field models @xcite , and we extend here that study to a broader range of cosmological models containing complex scalar fields or two coupled real scalar fields .",
    "+   + the cosmological action is written as : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the associated lagrangian density .",
    "we consider that the lagrangian contains a curvature term leading to einstein equations , a term involving scalar fields minimally coupled to gravity , and a term containing fermions potentially coupled to the scalar fields @xcite .",
    "we have then @xmath2 the curvature lagrangian is @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the planck mass and @xmath5 the curvature tensor . for a model containing a complex scalar field @xmath6 , the scalar field lagrangian can be written as : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the potential of the field . for two real scalar fields @xmath9 and @xmath10 ,",

    "+ we first restrict ourselves to the flat minkowski space , so that @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . + the method we use here to study the quantum corrections is the saddle point expansion described in @xcite .",

    "@xmath31 with a large momentum cutoff @xmath32 , and ignoring the @xmath6-independent contributions and the graphs of higher orders , the calculation of the effective potential due to the leading order scalar loop for two real coupled scalar fields leads to : @xmath33 + \\frac{m_b^4 } { 32\\pi^2 } \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{m_b^2}{\\lambda}\\right)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right]\\;\\;.\\ ] ] if the terms proportional to @xmath34 and @xmath35 are important in the context of usual field theory , in the case of cosmological scalar fields the potential is of the order of @xmath36 @xmath37 , and therefore we can safely disregard these terms in comparison to the terms proportional to @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for this reason , even if many of the cosmological potentials are non - renormalizable in the strict sense of field theory , we can consider that the cosmological potentials are renormalizable as the higher order terms are so small .",
    "therefore , the effective potential reduces to : @xmath40 we can also calculate the correction due to fermions : @xmath41 ^ 2 - \\frac{[m_f(\\phi_{cl})]^4 } { 32\\pi^2 } \\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{[m_f(\\phi_{cl})]^2}{\\lambda_{ferm}}\\right)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right ] \\;\\;.\\ ] ] again , because the fermion mass is very small in comparison to the planck mass , the terms proportional to @xmath42 ^ 4 $ ] can be neglected .",

    "i.e. _ of the order of @xmath45",
    ". we also note that the ignored @xmath6-independent contributions would lead to a cosmological constant of the order @xmath46 , which is by far much larger than the critical density .",
    "this well - known problem appearing in the majority of field theories could hopefully be solved by some mechanism which could make these contributions vanish .",
    "+ in the following , we will consider that @xmath47 unless stipulated otherwise , and we use units in which @xmath48 .",
    "we study first the case in which the scalar fields are not coupled to fermions , for quintessence , scalar field dark matter and scalar field dark fluid models , and then we consider the case with a coupling to the fermions .",
    "we calculate in this section the one - loop corrections to several cosmological scalar field potentials .",
    "first , we consider a single real scalar field associated to the sugra potential as in a dark energy quintessence model @xcite .",
    "then , we continue with the case of two coupled real scalar fields , involved in the coupled quintessence model @xcite .",
    "we also discuss a dark matter model based on a complex scalar field associated to a quadratic @xcite or quartic @xcite potential .",
    "finally , we analyse the case of a unifying dark fluid model involving a complex scalar field associated to a potential containing a quadratic term and a decreasing exponential term @xcite .",
    "the sugra potential for a quintessence real scalar field reads @xcite : @xmath49 where @xmath50 .",
    "we obtain the effective one - loop potential : @xmath51 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] it can be noted that the shape of the potential is changed .",
    "however , the global @xmath52 factor can be reabsorbed into the @xmath53 factor : @xmath54 , and the @xmath55 factor can also disappear with the redefinition @xmath56 .",
    "thus , the shape can remain similar if @xmath57 for a usual @xmath58 , as the present value of the field is of the order of @xmath4 , this inequality is respected today .",
    "however , as already noticed in @xcite concerning inverse power law potentials , problems could arise earlier as the correction can strongly modify the form of the potential .",
    "fortunately , the argument developed in @xcite should still hold for this kind of potential : the corrections are important only when quintessence was subdominant , and as corrections contains only negative power of @xmath59 , the field should be able to roll down the potential , and when the field becomes relevant to account for dark energy , the corrections may have become negligible . a more detailed analysis is nevertheless needed to check the validity of this scenario .",
    "we consider now the potential for two coupled real scalar fields of @xcite : @xmath60 with @xmath61 the derivatives of the potential reads : @xmath62   \\exp(-\\lambda \\phi_1 ) \\;\\;,\\ ] ] and @xmath63 so that the effective potential becomes : @xmath64 using the same values for the parameters as in @xcite , we can show that the additional terms which can not be reabsorbed are presently of the same order as the value of the non - corrected potential .",
    "therefore , the structure of the polynomial is globally changed , and unfortunately , the additional terms can not be reabsorbed in the constants .",
    "a way out could be to replace @xmath65 by a more general polynomial of the form @xmath66 the @xmath67 being constants . in this case",
    ", the loop correction terms can be reabsorbed into the constants .",
    "such a possibility has of course to be studied further , but would probably lack of credibility due to the high number of independent parameters .",
    "we study also the following potential of a complex scalar field @xcite : @xmath68 the effective potential can be obtained : @xmath69 as the effective potential is defined up to a constant , the constant term is irrelevant and can be safely disregarded . for @xmath70 ,",
    "the potential is therefore unchanged . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the potential is still stable , because the term @xmath72 can be reabsorbed into the redefinition @xmath73 .",
    "thus , this potential is stable through loop corrections , and is in fact renormalizable .",
    "of course , these results were predictable , as the quadratic and quartic potentials are well - known potentials which have been intensively studied .      finally , we consider the potential @xcite : @xmath74 this potential can lead to both dark matter and dark energy behaviors .",
    "the one - loop effective potential reads : @xmath75 again , the constant term can be safely disregarded .",
    "the term @xmath76 can be reabsorbed in the redefinition @xmath77 .",
    "however , a problem arises from the extra term @xmath78 which modifies the potential . considering the values of the parameters derived in @xcite",
    ", this term can not be neglected today and would lead to a strong modification of the potential , unless @xmath79 .",
    "we can however note that at earlier epochs , as @xmath80 was larger , this term was extincted by the exponential .",
    "+   + a way to solve this problem would be to modify the potential such as : @xmath81 in this case , the effective potential writes : @xmath82 \\exp(-\\beta \\phi_{cl}^\\dagger\\phi_{cl})\\nonumber\\;\\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the constant term is irrelevant . with two redefinitions :",
    "@xmath83 and @xmath84 , the correction terms of the second line vanish , but the last correction term of the first line still remains and modifies the potential shape .",
    "however , for @xmath85 , this term is negligible in comparison to the other terms , and the shape of the potential is then conserved .",
    "if @xmath86 and @xmath87 is small in comparison to @xmath88 , the analysis of @xcite would remain valid . in the case of a larger @xmath87",
    ", we could modify again the potential , such as : @xmath89 where @xmath90 goes from 0 to @xmath91 . in this case",
    ", the corrections can be reabsorbed into the constants @xmath92 , and the last correction of order @xmath93 will hopefully be negligible today in comparison to the other terms .",
    "yet , such a potential would lead to a behavior similar to that described in @xcite , provided the redefined terms @xmath94 ( for @xmath95 ) are today small in comparison to @xmath96 .",
    "+   + to conclude this section , we have studied the one - loop corrections to several scalar field potentials .",
    "some potentials can have difficulties to resist the quantum fluctuations .",
    "however , it is possible to build more suitable and robust potentials , in particular for the dark fluid model .",
    "we will now consider the corrections due to a coupling of the scalar fields to fermions .",
    "the fermion term in the effective potential reads : @xmath97 ^ 2 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] if the fermion mass is @xmath6-independent and of the order of 100 gev , and considering that the fermionic cutoff is taken at gut scale : @xmath98 , the fermionic term is of the order of @xmath99 , which is extremely large in comparison to the present value of the potential @xmath100 .",
    "thus , as noticed in @xcite , the fermionic corrections do not dominate the potential only if @xmath42 ^ 2 $ ] takes a form which is already contained in the classical potential , and which can then be reabsorbed in the constants of the potential .",
    "+   + let us focus for example on the dark fluid potential of eq .",
    "( [ df2 ] ) .",
    "the fermion mass can then take a form such as : @xmath101 or the square root of a sum of similar terms .",
    "however , a simpler acceptable form would be : @xmath102 ^ 2=(m_f^0)^2 \\phi_{cl}^\\dagger \\phi_{cl } \\;\\;.\\ ] ] in this case , @xmath103 can be reabsorbed by the redefinition @xmath104 .",
    "+   + we now consider the case where the coupling does not share the shape of the potential , and where the one - loop corrections can not be reabsorbed by higher order corrections .",
    "we can write the fermion mass as @xmath105 assuming here that @xmath106 , we have : @xmath107 \\;\\;.\\ ] ] the constant term is pointless , as the effective potential is defined up to a constant .",
    "thus , the global potential has a similar structure if @xmath108 for a present value of the potential such as @xmath100 , this leads to a limit on the present value of @xmath109 : @xmath110 this limit is so stringent that it nearly forbids a dependence of the mass on @xmath111 if the shape of the coupling is different from the shape of the potential .",
    "this result is similar for the quintessence potentials , and is in agreement with @xcite .",
    "we however have to notice that as we restricted ourselves to one - loop corrections , this limit has to be interpreted with reserve , as the higher order corrections could also modify the structure of the effective potential .",
    "we have just considered the effective one - loop quantum corrections to the scalar field potential .",
    "however , other corrections can also have an important influence on the scalar field behavior . in this section ,",
    "we study the corrections due to the space - time curvature , and the corrections to the kinetic term .      to simplify , we discuss here the case of a single real scalar field . to study the effects of the curvature on the potential",
    ", @xmath112 is assumed .",
    "we consider the same lagrangian densities as in the introduction .",
    "using the asympotic expansion of the heat kernel for the involved operators , one can show that the corrections involving the curvature tensor which modify the dynamics of the scalar field read @xcite : @xmath113\\\\ \\nonumber & & - \\frac{1}{32\\pi^2 } \\left ( [ m_f(\\phi_{cl})]^2 + \\frac{r}{12 } \\right)^2\\left[\\ln\\left(\\frac{[m_f(\\phi_{cl})]^2+r/12}{\\lambda_{ferm}}\\right)-\\frac{3}{2}\\right ] \\;\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath114 we can first note that in the case of a minkowskian space @xmath115 , the logarithmic terms of equations ( [ vsca_tot ] ) and ( [ vfer_tot ] ) are retrieved . practically , the other correction terms are not modified by the curvature , and only the logarithmic terms that we disregarded receive contributions . therefore , for small curvature , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath5 of the order of @xmath116 or @xmath117 , the terms which are involved here have a negligible impact on the effective potential at cosmological scales , and can be again neglected .",
    "the conclusion can be generalized to the case of two real or one complex scalar fields . however , more attention is of course needed in the case of a larger curvature .",
    "the analyzes of the previous sections are valid provided the khler potential is flat . at low energy , under a scale @xmath118 , the khler potential may be a more complicated function , called @xmath119 , which can be expanded in taylor series .",
    "for a single real scalar field , it writes : @xmath120 where @xmath121 are constants . if @xmath122 , the khler potential is considered as flat , and therefore this expansion holds if @xmath123 .",
    "+ in a flat space - time , the scalar field low - energy lagrangian is @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the khler metric on the one dimensional curve defined as : @xmath126 to better render the physical meaning of the khler potential , we redefine the field such as @xmath127 integrating and using an iterative inversion method , we can show that @xmath128 where the @xmath129 are constants which can be determined iteratively . with this redefinition , the kinetic term of @xmath6 is transformed into a standard kinetic term for @xmath130 , and the potential writes : @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes the @xmath133-th derivative of the potential @xmath8 , and @xmath134 are calculable constants .",
    "+ thus , the additional terms to the effective potential due to the kinetic term corrections are : @xmath135 we can first recall that the corrections appear if @xmath123 . therefore , the energy scale @xmath118 has an important influence here .",
    "for our study , we can assume that @xmath118 is of the order of the planck mass .",
    "the correction terms appear as powers of the scalar field times derivative of the potential . for the potentials we studied , because they involve either polynomials or exponential terms , they will keep their initial structure , but receive corrections under the form of powers of the scalar fields . + for the dark matter and dark fluid potentials ,",
    "as the kinetic corrections are small , they should not perturb much the dynamics of the scalar fields , at most providing some small long - range effects .",
    "however , in the case of quintessence models , a more detailed study would be needed to determine if these corrections could perturb the tracking properties , and then the behavior the fields .",
    "+ to conclude this sections , we have seen that other corrections can perturb the scalar fields .",
    "however , in models with small curvature or nearly flat khler potential , the considered corrections can be neglected .",
    "in this letter , we performed the calculation of the one - loop effective potentials of several cosmological models based on scalar fields .",
    "we have seen that some potentials are stable against the quantum fluctuations , and in particular the simple quadratic and quartic potentials of the dark matter scalar field models .",
    "different solutions to the instabilities of the coupled scalar field quintessence potential and of the dark fluid potential have been proposed .",
    "+ focusing on the fermionic corrections , we have confirmed the results of @xcite with regard to the extreme restriction of the coupling to the fermions .",
    "this constraint is relaxed if the coupling has a common structure with the scalar field potential or can be compensated by higher order corrections .",
    "+ concerning corrections due to the curvature or the kinetic term , we have seen that in usual case they are small , but they may have to be carefully studied in the case of strong curvature of the space - time or the khler potential .",
    "+ the calculations we performed in this work concern only the one - loop order corrections , and therefore do not give access to the true effective potential .",
    "however , such studies reveal to be valuable tools to test and build robust scalar field potentials .",
