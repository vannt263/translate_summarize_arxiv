    "modifications of general relativity ( gr ) are almost as old as the theory itself . many of these modifications are based on the idea of introducing additional geometrical degrees of freedom into the theory , thereby allowing to explain observations by geometry instead of introducing additional particles into the theory . a simple modification is the addition of a cosmological constant which gives rise to an accelerated expansion of the universe , although several sophisticated dark energy models have since been developed , see for instance  @xcite .",
    "modified theories of gravity in which the einstein - hilbert lagrangian is supplemented with additional curvature terms , have also been extensively analyzed recently  @xcite .",
    "although the above - mentioned modifications are based on the metric @xmath4 being the dynamical variable , it is interesting to note that an alternative approach to gr has been proposed , where the tetrad @xmath5 is considered the basic physical variable . since @xmath6 one is tempted to think of the tetrad as the square root of the metric , in analogy with the dirac equation being the square root of the klein - gordon equation .",
    "when working with the tetrad , one naturally encounters the notion of torsion , which can be used to describe gr entirely with respect to torsion instead of curvature ( without torsion ) derived from the metric only .",
    "this is the so - called teleparallel equivalent of general relativity ( tegr ) , see  @xcite .",
    "this equivalent formulation can now be used as the starting point to construct modified theories of gravity  @xcite .",
    "these @xmath0 gravity models , where @xmath1 is the torsion scalar , have interesting properties , for instance , the field equations are of second order , unlike @xmath7 gravity which is of fourth order in the metric approach .    in this context",
    ", @xmath0 models have been extensively applied to cosmology , and in particular to explain the late - time cosmic accelerating expansion without the need of dark energy  @xcite .",
    "the application to cosmology is very natural in the sense that the flrw metric is conformally flat , which makes it conceptually easier to understand in the teleparallel framework .",
    "recently , static and spherically solutions have also been studied in the context of @xmath0 gravity .",
    "the existence of such configurations has been establish in  @xcite , and various solutions have been explicitly constructed .",
    "this construction crucially depended on an appropriate ansatz for the tetrad field , an issue which is much more delicate in the teleparallel formulations of gr than in its metric formulation .",
    "the most general static and spherically symmetric tetrads up to lorentz transformation contain 6 free functions which results in a very complicated set of field equations which has not been studied in detail yet .",
    "even the situation in vacuum is far from trivial as can be seen from the recent study  @xcite where it turns out that a complicated tetrad is required in order to properly study the schwarzschild solution in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "this tetrad in general contains three free functions which become dependent in the schwarzschild case .",
    "in  @xcite , an off - diagonal tetrad gave rise to a set of field equations which closely resembles their general relativity counterpart .",
    "a diagonal tetrad , on the other hand , resulted in highly constrained models with constant torsion scalar , which are of less physical interest in this context .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate whether these @xmath0 field equations based on the off - diagonal tetrad admit static and spherically symmetric wormhole solutions .",
    "wormholes are hypothetical tunnels in spacetime , through which observers may freely traverse  @xcite . in gr",
    "wormhole spacetimes are supported by `` exotic matter '' , which involves a stress - energy tensor violating the null energy condition ( nec ) , i.e. , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is _ any _ null vector .",
    "the issue of exotic matter is a problematic one , so that it is useful to minimize its usage . in fact , in the context of modified theories of gravity , it is important to note that it is the effective stress - energy tensor that violates the null energy condition , and one may in principle allow the normal matter threading the wormhole to satisfy the energy conditions . more specifically in conformal weyl gravity and @xmath7 gravity , it is the higher order curvature terms that are responsible for supporting the geometries  @xcite .",
    "an observational method for the identification of wormholes through the analysis of the radiation spectrum of thin accretion disks around this type of compact objects was proposed in  @xcite . in braneworlds",
    ", it was found that the local high - energy bulk effects and the nonlocal corrections from the weyl curvature in the bulk that may induce a nec violating signature on the brane , while the stress energy tensor confined on the brane , threading the wormhole , is imposed to satisfy the energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "analogously , in @xmath0 gravity , by considering the field equations with an off - diagonal tetrad , we find a wide range of exact solutions , where the normal matter threading the wormhole satisfies the energy conditions , which differ radically from their general relativistic counterparts .",
    "this paper is organized in the following manner : in section [ sec1 ] we outline the general formalism of modified teleparallel gravity and present the field equations with an off - diagonal tetrad . in section [ sec3 ] , we find exact solutions of asymptotically flat wormhole geometries in @xmath0 gravity , where the normal matter satisfy the energy conditions , in particular , the null and weak energy conditions at the throat and its vicinity . in section [ concl ] , we conclude .",
    "in the teleparallel formulation of gr the dynamical variable is the tetrad fields @xmath10 .",
    "the greek indices ( holonomic ) denote the coordinates of the manifold while the latin indices ( anholonomic ) denote the frame .",
    "we can use the same symbol to denote the inverse of @xmath5 provided we carefully stagger frame and the coordinate index .",
    "let us define @xmath11 where the metric is given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the standard minkowski metric , which geometrically plays the role of the tangent space metric .",
    "the metric @xmath14 is used to raise and lower coordinate indices and @xmath15 raises and lowers frame indices .",
    "the crucial assumption of teleparallel gravity is that the manifold is globally flat .",
    "this means that the notion of parallelism holds globally and therefore one speaks of absolute parallelism which is a synonym of teleparallelism .",
    "this assumption is in stark contrast with gr where the notion of parallelism only holds locally and one can not compare vectors at different points without introducing notions of transport of vectors . due to the presence of torsion in such theories , one has to be careful when interpreting the implications of flatness .",
    "i.e.  the vanishing of the riemann curvature tensor ( metric plus torsion ) , does not imply that the metric is trivial .",
    "the converse is also true , namely , one can construct geometries with non - vanishing curvature starting from a flat metric . in the latter case , it is the torsion induced by the tetrad field which will give rise to some form of curvature .",
    "therefore , in teleparallel gravity there exists a coordinate system where the metric is globally minkowskian . in this case",
    "the tetrad fields give rise to a connection defined by @xmath16 which is the so - called weitzenbck connection .",
    "clearly , this can not be the levi - civita connection since its torsion is zero by definition .",
    "we define torsion and contortion by @xmath17 respectively .",
    "the contortion tensor can also be defined in terms of the weitzenbck and levi - civita connections .",
    "it turns out to be useful to define the tensor @xmath18 in the following way @xmath19 finally , we define the torsion scalar @xmath1 which is given by @xmath20 whose importance will become clear in a moment .",
    "due to the flatness of the manifold , the total riemann curvature tensor is zero .",
    "it contains two parts , a torsion free part defined by the levi - civita connection and a torsion part expressed in terms of the weitzenbck connection , or equivalently torsion .",
    "the ricci scalar will therefore also contain two pieces .",
    "this fact can be used to rewrite the torsionless ricci scalar in the einstein - hilbert action in terms of torsion .",
    "this particular combination of torsion terms which appears in this context is the above mentioned @xmath1 .",
    "note that the teleparallel equivalent of gr is invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations and local lorentz transformations .",
    "this latter part is non - trivial to see .",
    "it suffices to note that the teleparallel action of gr differs from its usual metric formulation only by a surface term . as the latter is lorentz invariant , so must be the former .",
    "the direct proof of this result is very involved and does not contain any additional information . note that @xmath0 gravity does not differ from @xmath7 by a surface term , thus local lorentz invariance will be broken by this theory .",
    "this also explains why the choice of tetrad is a delicate issue in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "two tetrads related by a local lorentz transformation do not yield equivalent field equations related by lorentz transformations .",
    "different tetrads will therefore pick out specific aspects of the theory . in principle",
    "one should therefore study the field equations starting with the most general tetrad subject to the required symmetry properties of the spacetime . however , such tetrads can result is very complex field equations which can not be solved analytically .",
    "let us consider the modified action ( with geometrized units @xmath21 ) @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the determinant of @xmath10 .",
    "variations of the action  ( [ eqn : action ] ) with respect to the tetrads @xmath5 gives the field equations of @xmath0 modified gravity which are given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 denote the first and second derivatives of @xmath28 with respect to @xmath1 , see  @xcite .",

    "<S> we find the general conditions for a wormhole satisfying the energy conditions at the throat and present specific examples that satisfy the energy conditions throughout the spacetime . as a consistency check </S>",
    "<S> , we also verify that in the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity , i.e. , @xmath3 , one regains the standard general relativistic field equations for wormhole physics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , considering specific choices for the @xmath0 form and for the redshift and shape functions , several solutions of wormhole geometries are found that satisfy the energy conditions at the throat and its neighbourhood . as in their general relativistic counterparts , these @xmath0 wormhole </S>",
    "<S> geometries present far - reaching physical and cosmological implications , such as being theoretically useful as shortcuts in spacetime and for inducing closed timelike curves , possibly violating causality . </S>"
