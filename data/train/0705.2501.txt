    ", the shape of the power spectrum has been the prime object of interest in order to confront theory and observation .",
    "any observed departure from a scale free , harrison - zeldovich type , power spectrum would indeed give a precious hint on the shape of the inflaton potential and subsequently on models of inflation  .",
    "but needless is to say that detection of primordial non - gaussianities in the cmb temperature anisotropies or polarization would also carry precious indications regarding the inflaton sector .",
    "it has been shown however that in its simplest formulation inflation does not lead to significant non - gaussianities ( ng ) .",
    "this result has been rigorously established at the level of the bispectrum over the last few years  @xcite and recently it has been extended to trispectrum  @xcite . to be more precise the low level of primordial ng that standard inflation",
    "is expected to induce is unlikely to be detected in practice due to the subsequent evolution of the metric whether it is at superhorizon scale , during or after the inflationary phase or during the complex stages of the recombination  @xcite .",
    "it appears then useful to have at our disposal sets of models in which significant primordial non - gaussianities can be produced , that is an amount of ng that clearly exceeds what the nonlinear gravitational evolution is inducing .",
    "this appears to be the case for instance for models built out of actions close to the dirac - born - infeld one @xcite .",
    "those models however rely on non trivial extension of the kinetic part of the lagrangian .",
    "although that would be a ground breaking discovery to see such effects , it remains that the appearance of primordial ng does not require the use of such non - standard extension of the low - energy field equation .",
    "the curvaton model offers another path to possible large amount of primordial ng  @xcite . here primordial non",
    "- gaussianities are induced lately , at the time the energy density of the curvaton field overcome the inflaton decay products .",
    "the efficiency of such a mechanism therefore depends on sectors of the theory that are not directly relevant to the inflation .",
    "a third possibility has recently been advocated which is entirely determined in the inflationary sector .",
    "it is provided by some models of multiple field inflations .",
    "the mechanism at play has been described in various papers  @xcite .",
    "the difficulty so far is to identify more precisely models in which such a scenario could take place . in @xcite explicit lagrangian ( with canonical kinetic terms ) were proposed for which significant non - gaussianities can be generated during the inflationary phase .",
    "although it was demonstrated that it was possible to get them during the whole inflationary stage , the most efficient ( and in some sense most natural ) model in which such a possibility was achieved was based on an hybrid inflation type construction . in this case",
    "significant non - gaussianities can be transferred to the metric fluctuations at the very end of inflation , at the time of the tachyonic instability  .",
    "the model proposed in @xcite was however purely phenomenological and was not motivated by high energy physics constructions .",
    "we propose here to explore a bit further high - energy physics motivations for multiple - field hybrid inflation .",
    "hybrid inflationary models introduced by a. linde  @xcite provided a way to circumvent one fundamental issue in standard inflation with simple potentials , that is that the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of the inflaton field is bound to be of the order of the planck mass during the inflationary period  @xcite .",
    "this is the case in particular with quadratic or quartic potentials . with hybrid inflation",
    "the end of inflation is triggered by a tachyonic instability and the vevs of the fields can be made as small as one wishes ( at the expense of a power spectrum index very close to unity ) .",
    "hybrid inflation has received some further theoretical justification because it naturally appears in various high energy setups . in the context of global supersymmetry",
    ", it is indeed possible to construct potentials which allow a viable inflationary period , either based on the f- or the d - term of the potentials  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this paper is to take advantage of such theoretical frameworks to build models of multiple field inflation and explore their phenomenological consequences .",
    "the plan of the paper is the following .",
    "we first succinctly review the construction and constraints associated to supersymmetric hybrid models .",
    "we then present possible extensions of these models and their phenomenological consequences .",
    "the amount of non - gaussianity they can lead to is precisely computed and confronted to observational constraints .",
    "in a supersymmetric context , two scenarios have been identified that lead to inflationary models that reproduce hybrid type potentials .",
    "those scenarios are the f- and d- term inflationary models  @xcite .",
    "they allow in particular to have inflation while the field vevs remain small compared to the planck mass .",
    "in such a case the expression of the low energy lagrangian is safe from corrective terms originating from supergravity effects ( e.g. through the khler potential ) or high - order curvature terms .",
    "this is the domain we will stick to throughout this paper .    to be more specific ,",
    "the f- and d - term inflation are based on the specific global supersymmetry breaking mechanisms .",
    "once symmetry breaking occurs , the potential has to be corrected for one - loop radiative correction terms .",
    "these corrections are encapsulated in the the formula of coleman - weinberg derived in  @xcite .",
    "for soft supersymmetry breaking schemes ( where the trace of the mass matrices remain unchanged ) one is left with logarithmic corrections to the potential .",
    "this is precisely what we have for f- and d - term inflationary models .",
    "the f - term inflation is based on a superpotential of the form  @xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 correspond to the scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting potential is the following .",
    "it comes from f - term contribution only , @xmath4 the energetic landscape it leads to shows that there exists a flat direction along which the potential is constant ( at tree order ) but non - vanishing .",
    "it is for a such field configuration that the inflationary phase can take place .",
    "this flat direction is obtained for @xmath5 .",
    "it corresponds to a stable minimum ( e.g. all masses are positive ) as long as @xmath6 that is @xmath7 with @xmath8 such a vacuum state obviously breaks global supersymmetry .",
    "it implies that corrective terms due to non - vanishing radiative corrections have to be added to the potential .",
    "at one - loop order , they approximatively read , @xmath9 this is thanks to this extra contribution that such a setting can lead to a viable inflationary model .",
    "it induces a ( slow ) roll of the field @xmath1 towards the origin . in this scenario inflation",
    "terminates when @xmath10 due to the tachyonic instability that then appears . during the inflationary phase the potential can be approximated by , @xmath11 to a very good approximation .",
    "the mechanism that leads to a d - term inflation is very similar  @xcite .",
    "this model is based on the introduction of a @xmath12 symmetry group and a non - vanishing fayet - iliopoulos term leading to a non - zero d - term in the potential .",
    "another family of inflationary models can then be constructed with the help of three fields , one , @xmath1 , with zero charge , a field @xmath3 with a positive charge and a field @xmath2 with a negative one under the @xmath12 symmetry and with the following superpotentiel , @xmath13 it leads to the potential , @xmath14 in a way similar to the f - term inflation , the potential exhibits a flat stable direction when , @xmath15 with @xmath16 in this case the inflaton potential is given by , @xmath17 this is the context in which we will work in the following .      a number of conditions should be met for such models to provide us with valid inflationary models : the number of efolds it leads to should be large enough and the amplitude of the metric fluctuations is constrained .",
    "these are obviously constraints that are generic for all inflationary models .",
    "there are however two difficulties that one wants to avoid in the context of d - term inflation .",
    "namely one does not want the vevs of the fields to exceed the planck scale so that global supersymmetry remains a valid description of the lagrangian and the formation of too massive cosmic strings at the end of the inflationary phase should also be avoided .",
    "the first requirement leads us to assume that not only @xmath18 is small but also that the first term of the inflaton potential , the constant one , is dominating over the second contribution .",
    "this is possible if @xmath19 with such a constraint the end of inflation takes place when @xmath10 . the number of efolds between horizon crossing for the modes of interest ( the ones that are responsible for the observed large - scale structure ) and the end of inflation can then be easily computed .",
    "it is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the modulus of @xmath1 during horizon crossings and @xmath22 is the planck mass , @xmath23 .",
    "the amplitude of the metric fluctuations @xmath24 for the modes of interest is observed to be of the order of @xmath25 ( see next section for more details ) .",
    "it implies that @xmath26 these two relations lead to the constraint , @xmath27 \\approx 10^{-8}. \\ ] ] this expression exhibits two regimes . one in which @xmath28 and then the energy scale of @xmath29 is fixed , of the order of @xmath30 , and one in which @xmath31 and where @xmath32 . but",
    "@xmath29 is precisely the energy scale of the strings that form at the end of inflation .",
    "the constraint on the string content of the universe favors the second case ( see @xcite for details .",
    "it is to be noted also that it might be possible to circumvent this constraint ) .",
    "it is to be noted that in this latter case @xmath21 is nearly equal to @xmath18 .",
    "more precisely we have , @xmath33 we will see that this is of importance for the phenomenological consequences of d - term extended models .",
    "here we now propose to extend the field content involved in the inflationary sector of the theory . following a conservative approach regarding the high energy sector of the theory",
    "we allow ourselves to introduce up to cubic terms only in the superpotential .",
    "for instance a superpotentiel of the form , @xmath34 is a priori legitimate .",
    "it involves two light fields that coexist during the inflationary phase .",
    "if @xmath35 is smaller than the hubble value during the inflationary phase then super - hubble fluctuations can be generated in the @xmath36 field . whether those fluctuations will be observable or not depends on the subsequent evolution of the @xmath36 field .",
    "in particular , because @xmath36 is a massive field , its energy density can eventually dominate over the inflaton decay products if those are relativistic particles .",
    "the @xmath36 field can then imprint its fluctuations on the metric fluctuations before it finally decays .",
    "this is the curvaton mechanism .",
    "this possibility , and its phenomenological consequences , have been extensively described in the literature  @xcite .",
    "they depend largely on the coupling of the extra fields to the other fields of the theory .",
    "such a theory is then not entirely predictive from the sole knowledge of the inflationary sector of the theory .",
    "the expression ( [ spcurvaton ] ) is however not the only possible extension of ( [ spdterm ] ) .",
    "for instance nothing prevents the introduction of multiple light fields that are coupled together to the same charged @xmath12 fields , @xmath37 obviously if @xmath38 is small enough , the corresponding @xmath39 field can participate in the inflaton ( depending on its initial vev ) .",
    "the corresponding upper bound for @xmath38 for such a possibility to occur is defined in such a way that , when , say , the vev of @xmath39 is below the planck scale , the contribution of the quartic potential it induces is negligible against the radiative correction term .",
    "it leads to the constraint , @xmath40 the fields for which @xmath41 is above this bound will rapidly roll towards the origin but they still can develop significant super - hubble fluctuations as long as @xmath41 is smaller than unity .",
    "this would not be the case otherwise .",
    "it is then possible to distinguish three sets of fields , those with a very small coupling constant @xmath42 ; they can potentially be part of the inflaton field ; the ones with intermediate values ; they will not contribute to the inflaton but still develop significant super - hubble fluctuations and finally those with a large coupling constant will not develop any significant fluctuations and will not play any role . in the following",
    "we will be interested in the second set of fields .    to simplify the presentation",
    "let us assume that there is one field @xmath43 with a vanishing coupling constant @xmath44 and one field @xmath36 with a large - but still smaller than unity - @xmath45 .",
    "then the potential takes the form , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the mixing angle of @xmath43 and @xmath36 encoded in the @xmath48 parameters .    as for the previous case",
    ", @xmath3 is a very massive field whose vev is driven to 0 .",
    "the previous expression then simplifies and we are left with the effective potential , @xmath49 involving the ( complex scalar ) fields @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath2 .",
    "we see that it involves a new term , the self coupling term of the @xmath51 field .",
    "it drives the vev of this field to 0 during the inflationary period .",
    "the expression of @xmath52 is then left unchanged compared to the single inflationary field case . as for the curvaton model",
    ", the @xmath51 direction behaves like an isocurvature direction during the inflationary period . because of the mixing term in the @xmath39-@xmath2 coupling though",
    ", the @xmath51 fluctuations can lead to visible effects irrespectively of the subsequent evolution of this field . to be more precise",
    ", the inflation terminates when @xmath53 reaches the critical value @xmath18 . in the context we are considering",
    ", the inflationary period then ends almost instantaneously because of the tachyonic instability that subsequently develops @xcite .",
    "the end time of inflation is then modulated by both fluctuations in the @xmath43 and @xmath36 directions .",
    "this is the mechanism with which initial isocurvature fluctuations are transferred into the adiabatic modes .",
    "the metric fluctuations that are then induced are a combination of @xmath43 and @xmath36 fluctuations .",
    "as long as the only leading order metric effects are taken into account , the formal expression of the metric fluctuations can be easily computed using the @xmath54 formalism  @xcite .",

    "this direction , without loss of generality , can be defined as the real axis , @xmath62 and the real part of @xmath36 , @xmath63 the imaginary parts of those fields are genuine degree of freedom that will develop super - hubble correlations as well",
    ". they will affect though the expression of @xmath57 at quadratic order only , as any other couplings to the metric would . at the level of our description",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath59 will not play any role .",
    "the one of @xmath60 will do however , because it affects the non - gaussian properties of @xmath64 as we will discover .",
    "what is important here to realize is that in the parameter domain favored by the constraints on the cosmic strings contribution to the cmb anisotropies as discussed previously , the two coefficients , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are , almost , equal .",
    "moreover the two fields are independent of one another ; their fluctuations have roughly the same spectrum , to the difference in their mass , e.g. @xmath67 parameter . the generated metric fluctuations",
    "are then the superposition of these two contributions the relative weight is driven by a free parameter , the mixing angle between the two fields , @xmath47 .",
    "the amplitude of the induced metric fluctuations per unit log scale in @xmath68 , @xmath69 , is then typically given by  .",
    "] , @xmath70 this is this number that is constrained by the observations : @xmath69 is of the order of @xmath71 ( see for instance @xcite . )    one can be a bit more precise .",

    "the most interesting consequences of such a family of models comes from the fact that they can potentially induce significant non - gaussianities . by significant we mean that such non - gaussianities can be much larger than what generic single field inflation predicts .",
    "the amount of non - gaussianities which is generated is actually a direct consequence of the formula ( [ dnexp ] ) .",

    "such properties could be transferred in the observed metric perturbation in case of a small mixing angle .",
    "let us recall that at super - hubble scales the evolution equation for each component of the field is given by , @xmath124 for each component of the field and as long as the slow roll conditions are valid .",

    "the relation ( [ nltransform ] ) would be valid if the fluctuations had all the same scale and cross the horizon at the same time .",
    "this is not so .",

    "when one wants to avoid fine tuned terms in the superpotential , the potential is naturally quartic and such models are remarquably constrained . in particular the shape of the inflationary potential has only a limited number of parameters .",

    "we have focused on a regime suggested by the observational constraints regarding cosmic strings formations .",
    "those constraints impose that the hubble scale is essentially constant during the inflationary phase which makes the transfer of modes , from isocurvature to adiabatic , potentially very efficient .",
    "finite volume effects also introduce new dynamically determined parameters that induce effective cubic terms in the potential @xcite the consequence of which we also present .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of such a family of models can be obtained analytically .",
    "the induced high order correlation functions are due to super - hubble evolution of the field .",
    "this opens the possibility of having weakly non - gaussian fields .",
    "two parameter domains can be distinguished for its phenomenology .",
    "if the mixing angle is generic then the current constraints suggest that the coupling parameter is small enough so that a tree order calculation of a perturbation theory suffice to derive the bi- and tri - spectra of the metric field . on the other hand",
    "if the mixing is small enough ( 0.1 for instance ) , then the resulting metric statistical properties might have been shaped by a nonlinear evolution of the field during its super - hubble evolution . in principle , such an evolution can nonetheless be addressed analytically because , at such scales , the fields enter a purely classical behavior .",
    "we present some tentative description of the evolution of the high order moments of the field .",
    "the set of predictions we have obtained has eventually been confronted to the current constraints and to the expected constraints that the planck satellite is expected to provide us for .",
    "it is shown that a joint use of cmb temperature bispectrum and trispectrum is required to efficiently explore the parameter space of such models .",
    "this , with the curvaton mechanism , is one of the very few explicit models in which primordial ng can significantly exceeds those naturally induced by the gravitational dynamics . in this case , it is fully determined by the inflationary sector of the theory .",
    "we review here the formal expression of the connected bi- and tri - spectrum of the component of a test scalar complex field in a de sitter background .",
    "we assume that the potential contains cubic and quartic terms , @xmath130 as implied by the form ( [ newpot ] ) .",

    "the perturbative calculations of those correlators can be done with the in - in formalism ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if @xmath131 is the quantity the vacuum expectation value one wants to compute then it can be shown that a perturbative expansion is given by @xmath132 , -\\ii h^{(i)}(\\eta_{2})]\\dots]\\vert 0{\\rangle},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath133 is the interaction part of the hamiltonien , @xmath134 is an arbitrarily early time when the interaction is supposed to start playing a role , @xmath67 is the time at which the expectation value is computed and @xmath135 are the field values at time @xmath67 when they evolve according to the non - interacting part of the lagrangian . in the following we use this formulae for @xmath136 , @xmath137 and for @xmath138 while keeping the expansion only to tree order .",
    "the expression of those correlators will depend on the time dependance of the free field .",

    "the mode configuration correspond to an equilateral configuration ( @xmath147 ) but the asymptotic behavior of @xmath148 is independent on the configuration ( dashed line ) if @xmath103 is defined as @xmath149 with @xmath150 .",

    "we will denote it as the `` star '' contribution .",
    "the other is due to the cubic terms of the potential .",
    "there are two such contributions ( one due to an exchange of @xmath64 degree of freedom and one to an exchange of @xmath151 ) .",
    "altough a priori smaller than the previous term , these two contributions are not necessarily negligeable .",
    "similarly to @xmath148 one can define the reduced tri - spectra as can be defined since the two contributions do not have the same late time super - horizon behavior . ] , @xmath154 and @xmath155 this function is shown on right panel of fig .",
