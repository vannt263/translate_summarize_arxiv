    "in the endeavor to understand nature on its most fundamental level , physicists are striving for a description of all fundamental forces within a single unified theory .",

    "a detected drift in @xmath3 or @xmath0 could thus provide valuable insight into the fundamental workings of nature beyond our current understanding . to date",
    ", laboratory measurements have verified the stability of @xmath3 and @xmath0 on the fractional level of @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite per annum , respectively .",
    "more stringent laboratory tests are further motivated by recent evidence of a spatial gradient in the value of @xmath0 based on an analysis of quasar absorption spectra @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the earth s motion relative this gradient may lead to measureable effects in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "the ye group at jila ( boulder ) aims to test the stability of @xmath3 to high precision using @xmath7sr@xmath1 molecules confined in an optical lattice @xcite . the experimental protocol , as outlined by zelevinsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , calls for optical raman spectroscopy between select vibrational levels of the @xmath8 ground electronic potential .",
    "a variation in @xmath3 alters the vibrational spectrum , and experimental sensitivity to this change may be optimized with a prudent choice of levels to incorporate into the spectroscopic scheme .",
    "it was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that , with respect to variation in @xmath3 , the lowest and highest vibrational levels experience minimal displacement relative to the potential , whereas levels in the intermediate part of the spectrum experience a much larger shift .",
    "_  have focused on transitions between the @xmath9 intermediate level ( @xmath10 being the vibrational quantum number ) and `` anchor '' levels at the bottom and top of the spectrum .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] illustrates the basic objective of the experiment .",
    "a detected drift in the frequency ratio @xmath11 ( see figure ) is to be interpreted as a drift in the electron - to - proton mass ratio .",
    "the curve represents the @xmath8 electronic potential , with horizontal dashed lines corresponding to select vibrational levels supported by this potential .",
    "frequencies @xmath12 and @xmath13 are to be measured by an optical ramsey scheme involving an intermediate excited electronic state ( not shown ) .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath11 is sensitive to variations in @xmath3 and is independent of any external reference ( clock ) frequency . ]    here we investigate the effect of @xmath0 variation on this promising experiment .",
    "the electronic potential depends on @xmath0 through relativistic effects of electron motion .",
    "a variation of @xmath0 alters the potential and , consequently , the vibrational spectrum supported by it .",
    "thus , a measured drift in @xmath11 may be due ( or partially due ) to @xmath0 variation , threatening misinterpretation of the experimental results .",
    "the experiment described by zelevinsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "is similar in spirit to an experiment posed simultaneously by demille _",

    "@xcite to test the stability of @xmath3 using diatomic molecules .",
    "a key difference is that , whereas zelevinsky _",
    "et al . _",
    "focus on a single electronic potential , demille _",
    "et al . _",
    "suggest probing the splitting between vibrational levels supported by different electronic potentials .",
    "recently , we analyzed the influence of @xmath0 variation on the experiment of demille _",
    "et al . _",
    "using a semi - classical ( wkb ) approach , specifically focusing on the system @xmath7cs@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "we found the experiment to be order - of - magnitude as sensitive to fractional variation in @xmath0 as it is to fractional variation in @xmath3 .",
    "considering the anticipated precision of this experiment  @xcite , together with the current laboratory limit on @xmath0 variation  @xcite , we concluded that @xmath0 variation may not be negligible for the proposed experiment .",
    "this finding largely motivated our present work .",
    "strictly speaking , only variations in dimensionless quantities have physical meaning . for a given vibrational level @xmath10 , we will concern ourselves with the normalized energy @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the vibrational energy relative to the bottom of the potential and @xmath16 is the potential depth . clearly , @xmath17 is limited to the range @xmath18 .",
    "variations in @xmath3 and @xmath0 induce a shift in @xmath17 , @xmath19 where we employ the shorthand notation @xmath20 the quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 quantify the sensitivity of the vibrational level @xmath10 to fractional variations in the electron - to - proton mass ratio and the fine structure constant , respectively .",
    "we could , if desired , regard @xmath23 as an `` absolute '' energy shift , an association which amounts to arbitrarily assuming the potential depth to be fixed with respect to any variation .",
    "fixing any other energy reference  such as the atomic unit of energy , given by @xmath24 , or the si unit of energy , which itself references the hyperfine frequency of cs as well as a platinum - iridium prototype mass held in paris  @xcite  would be equally justified and would generally yield a different `` absolute '' energy shift . here",
    "we actively avoid the possibly slippery notion of absolute energy shift and quote results for @xmath21 and @xmath22 , as these are unambiguously defined .",

    "( [ eq : morseenergies ] ) we see that a variation in @xmath17 may be attributed solely to a variation in the parameter @xmath32 . specifically , we may write @xmath33 , \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{eq : morsevar}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 $ ] . the function @xmath35 is displayed in fig .",

    "the most deeply ( @xmath41 ) and loosely ( @xmath42 ) bound levels are insensitive to variations , while intermediate levels have much larger sensitivities . ]",
    "we may go a step further and , based on physical reasoning , deduce a numerical value for the factor @xmath43 appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : morsevar ] ) .",
    "this is accomplished most transparently by assuming atomic units , though we reiterate that @xmath32 itself is dimensionless . when expressed in atomic units , the molecular potential ( and its depth , width , etc . )",
    "is independent of the electron - to - proton mass ratio , whereas the reduced mass has a value which is inversely proportional to @xmath3 . from the definition of @xmath32",
    ", it follows that @xmath44 .",
    "in contrast to @xmath43 , there is not a simple analytical result for the factor @xmath45 .",
    "nevertheless , we may provide a physically reasonable estimate of @xmath45 by realizing that , in atomic units , the electronic potential is independent of @xmath0 in the nonrelativistic limit , having relativistic corrections which scale as @xmath46 , with @xmath47 being the nuclear charge number .",
    "this suggests that @xmath48 . from this reasoning",
    ", we may suspect the vibrational spectrum of @xmath7sr@xmath1 to be nearly as sensitive to @xmath0 variation as it is to @xmath3 variation .",
    "the exercise of this section provides us with useful insight which is applicable to real physical systems . a true potential , of course ,",
    "is not restricted to the form of a morse potential .",
    "nevertheless , the function @xmath35 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : fz ] is expected to give a qualitatively accurate depiction of the sensitivities @xmath21 and @xmath22 versus the normalized energy @xmath17 . in the vicinity of the equilibrium distance",
    ", the potential resembles that of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "the lower portion of the energy spectrum is then well - described by a single term , proportional to @xmath49 , in a dunham - type expansion . across this region ,",
    "@xmath21 vs @xmath17 and @xmath22 vs @xmath17 are essentially linear . approaching the dissociation limit ,",
    "anharmonic effects become important and the remaining terms in the dunham expansion , proportional to @xmath50 , @xmath51 , etc . , then drive the sensitivities back to zero . the fact that the sensitivities approach zero in the limits",
    "@xmath41 and @xmath42 is a consequence of our choice for the zero of energy ( bottom of the potential ) and our choice to normalize energy to the dissociation energy .",
    "we have calculated the @xmath8 potential of @xmath7sr@xmath1 using the relativistic computation chemistry program dirac10  @xcite . in order to reduce computational effort we employed the infinite order two - component relativistic hamiltonian obtained after the barysz - sadlej - snijders ( bss ) transformation of the dirac hamiltonian in a finite basis set @xcite .",
    "this approximation includes both scalar and spin - orbit relativistic effects to infinite order and is one of the most computer time efficient and accurate approximations to the four - component dirac - coulomb hamiltonian .",
    "electron correlation was taken into account using closed - shell single - reference coupled - cluster theory including single , double , and perturbative triple excitations [ ccsd(t ) ] .",
    "the faegri dual family basis set @xcite was used , augmented by diffuse and high angular momentum exponents to obtain @xmath52 gaussian orbitals .",
    "virtual orbitals with energies above 45 a.u .  were omitted , and the 56 outer core electrons were correlated .",
    "we subsequently fed our ccsd(t ) potential curve into a matlab routine to solve the schrdinger equation for the nuclear part of the molecular wave function within the born - oppenheimer approach .",
    "a symmetric three - point finite difference method was applied to obtain the nuclear eigenfunctions together with their corresponding vibrational energies . for the discretization of the internuclear distance a step size of @xmath53  ",
    "was chosen .",
    "we may gauge the accuracy of our _ ab initio _ method through direct comparison with experimental results of gerber _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite .",
    "these authors have tabulated energies for the @xmath54 through @xmath55 portion of the @xmath8 vibrational spectrum .",
    "furthermore , they have determined the dissociation energy of this state to be @xmath56 .",
    "our computed dissociation energy , @xmath57 , is about @xmath58 lower than the experimental value .",
    "comparing individual levels , we find that our computed vibrational energies differ from experimental values by no more than 2  @xmath59 for levels spanning the lower half of the potential depth ( @xmath54 through @xmath60 ) . above this",
    ", our computed energies steadily diverge from experiment values , with our values being increasingly smaller in comparison .",
    "for example , for @xmath9 our computed energy @xmath61 is 3% lower than the experimental value @xmath62 , whereas for @xmath55 our computed energy @xmath63 is 5% lower than the experimental value @xmath64 .",
    "this divergence in the upper part of the spectrum is undoubtedly correlated to the fact that our dissociation energy is lower than the experimental dissociation energy .    to see how the normalized energies change with respect to variations in @xmath3 and @xmath0 , we recompute the potential energy curve , as well as the vibrational spectrum supported by it , for various values of @xmath3 and @xmath0 in the neighborhood of @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the computational chemistry programs assume atomic units ; numerical variations in @xmath3 and @xmath0 are effected by modifying parameter values for the reduced mass within our matlab routine and the speed of light within dirac10 ( @xmath67  for @xmath68sr@xmath1 and @xmath69 , where @xmath70  denotes the respective atomic units of mass and velocity ) .",
    "we then obtain the sensitivities @xmath21 and @xmath22 from numerical differentiation with respect to @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "we emphasize that our method for obtaining these sensitivities treats variations in @xmath3 and @xmath0 in a similar manner and on equal footing .",
    "figure  [ fig : sensyandy ] displays our results for @xmath21 and @xmath22 for the levels @xmath54 through @xmath55 ; these level sensitivities are plotted versus the normalized energy @xmath17 .",
    "we note a behavior which resembles that `` predicted '' by the morse potential .",
    "namely , both sensitivity curves approach the appropriate limits for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while simultaneously peaking at @xmath71 .",
    "moreover , the curves are found to be essentially proportional , with the ratio @xmath72 being @xmath73 across the entire range of data ( and 0.28 at the common maximum of the two curves ) .     and @xmath22 vs @xmath17 for the @xmath8 state of @xmath7sr@xmath1 .",
    "the circles correspond to _ ab initio _",
    "results for individual levels @xmath54 through @xmath55 , with the solid curves being fits to this data ( the fits are extended through @xmath74 ) . ]",
    "here we have considered the influence of @xmath0 variation on the experiment proposed by zelevinsky _",
    "_  @xcite to probe variation in the electron - to - proton mass ratio using the vibrational spectrum of @xmath7sr@xmath1 .",
    "the relevant observable in this experiment is the frequency ratio @xmath11 , illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] . with one `` anchor '' level taken at the bottom of the spectrum and another at the top , the frequency ratio is given approximately by @xmath75 where @xmath10 labels the intermediate level ( e.g. , @xmath9 in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] ) .",
    "our _ ab initio _ computations predict that the frequency ratio @xmath11 is only 3 to 4 times less sensitive to variation in @xmath0 as it is to variation in @xmath3 .",
    "specifically , we find that variations in @xmath3 and @xmath0 induce a variation in @xmath11 according to the relation @xmath76 we estimate the uncertainty in the factor 0.28 to be on the order of 10% , based primarily on the discrepancy of our computed dissociation energy to the experimental dissociation energy",
    ". equation ( [ eq : deltar ] ) summarizes the principle result of this work .",
    "the factor @xmath77 here is given approximately by @xmath78 ; non - zero shifts in the two anchor levels amount to small corrections which reduce @xmath77 from this value . as suggested by eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltar ] ) , a measured drift in the frequency ratio @xmath11 can not , by itself , be used to distinguish between @xmath3 variation or @xmath0 variation . to extract information about variations in the respective constants themselves",
    "requires further experimental input .",
    "optical ion clocks have been used to test the stability of @xmath0 , with the ratio of clock frequencies being insensitive to @xmath3 variation .",
    "the current best limit on @xmath0 variation allows for a drift on the fractional level of @xmath79/year @xcite . for the proposed experiment of zelevinsky _",
    "_ , this result may be used with eq .",
    "( [ eq : deltar ] ) to justify neglect of @xmath0 variation , which has been implicitly assumed in previous works  @xcite . on the other hand , for high experimental precision ",
    "namely , experimental precision capable of detecting a drift in @xmath3 at the fractional level of @xmath80/year  equation  ( [ eq : deltar ] ) indicates that @xmath0 variation should not be neglected .",
    "such high precision is conceivable ; in the related proposal of demille _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , referred to in the introduction , the authors argued that their method could plausibly detect fractional variations in @xmath3 at @xmath81 .    for such high experimental precision , additional experimental input",
    "could perhaps be obtained by substituting @xmath7sr@xmath1 with another species , such as @xmath7yb@xmath1 , in the experiment .",
    "yb has a similar valence structure as sr and also has isotopes which lack nuclear spin ( @xmath82yb ) .",
    "moreover , as with sr , high precision spectroscopy on optically trapped yb has become a refined art @xcite . from the @xmath46 scaling of the relativistic corrections to the electronic potential , we may presume that an @xmath7yb@xmath1 experiment would be about equally sensitive to @xmath0 variation as to @xmath3 variation , with an estimated sensitivity ratio @xmath83 .",
