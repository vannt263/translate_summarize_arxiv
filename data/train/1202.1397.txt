    "the modified gravity has spurred an increasing deal of interest recently , because it can explain , without the introduction of an exotic dark energy , the present accelerating cosmic expansion discovered firstly from the type ia supernovae ( sne ia )  @xcite . among the modified gravity theories ,",
    "the dvali - gabadadze - porrati ( dgp ) braneworld scenario  @xcite , generalized firstly to cosmology by deffayet  @xcite , is a very simple and popular one .",
    "the dgp theory starts with the idea that our observed four - dimensional universe resides in a five - dimensional , infinite - volume minkowski bulk and the whole energy - momentum is confined on a three dimensional spacial brane .",
    "in contrast to the randall - sundrum  @xcite and shtanov - sahni  @xcite braneworld scenarios with high energy modifications to general relativity , the dgp brane produces a low energy modification ( for a review of the phenomenology of the dgp model , see ref .",
    ".    since there are two different ways to embed the 4-dimensional brane universe into the 5-dimensional spacetime , the dgp model has two separate branches denoted by @xmath1 .",
    "the @xmath2 branch is self - accelerating in the sense that the universe is rendered to accelerate at late times due to the lowly leaking of the gravity off our four - dimensional world into an extra dimension and to evolve eventually into a de sitter phase  @xcite .",
    "however , the @xmath3 branch is very different since it does not self - accelerate .",
    "thus , in order to explain the present cosmic acceleration in this branch , dark energy is required on the brane , like in the ldgp model  @xcite and qdgp model  @xcite .    the inflation and preheating on the dgp brane have been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite and some new characteristics have been found .",
    "for example , the dgp inflation driven by a single scalar field with an exponential potential yields much better consistency with the current observation data  @xcite .",
    "recently , we discussed the stability of the einstein static universe in the dgp scenario  @xcite and obtained that the universe can stay at this stable einstein static state past - eternally , undergo a series of infinite , non - singular oscillations , and then evolve to inflation .",
    "therefore , the big bang singularity can be avoided .",
    "moreover , the cosmic background evolutions in the dgp model have been studied in  @xcite . with a large value of the dark radiation term",
    ", it was found that the spatially flat dgp braneworld gives the same dynamical possibilities of the cosmic evolution as a closed frw universe and these possibilities include the oscillating , the bouncing , the einstein static universes and the so - called loitering universe ( see fig.(4 ) of @xcite ) . in the present paper ,",
    "we plan to classify all possible cosmic evolutions in the dgp braneworld with a method in which the friedmann equation is written in a form such that evolution of the scale factor can be treated as that of a particle in a  potential \" .",
    "the effect of the dark radiation are also considered in contrast to ref .",
    "different from ref .",
    "@xcite , we keep , in our discussion , the spatial curvature term and do not impose the condition of a large value of the dark radiation .",
    "let us note that this method has been used to classify the cosmic evolution in the horava - lifshitz gravity  @xcite .",
    "we consider a homogeneous and isotropic universe described by the friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the cosmic scale factor and @xmath6 is the constant curvature of the three - space of the frw metric . in the dgp brane scenario ,",
    "the friedmann equation can be written as  @xcite @xmath7\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is the hubble parameter , @xmath9 the total energy density and @xmath10 a parameter denoting the strength of the induced gravity on the brane .",
    "@xmath11 is given by @xmath12^{1/2}\\;,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 with @xmath14 defined as @xmath15 here @xmath16 is the 5-dimensional newton constant , @xmath17 the 5-dimensional cosmological constant in the bulk , @xmath18 the brane tension , and @xmath19 an integration constant related to the weyl radiation ( dark radiation ) which is assumed to be positive in this paper .",
    "for simplicity , we restrict ourselves to the randall- sundrum critical case , i.e. @xmath20 , then eq.(2 ) simplifies to @xmath21 in the very early era of the universe the total energy density should be very high .",
    "thus , we will , in the following , only consider the ultra high energy limit , @xmath22 .",
    "in addition , we let @xmath23 . as a result",
    ", the friedmann equation reduces to @xmath24 the dark radiation term is retained here in contrast to ref  @xcite where it is neglected .",
    "when @xmath5 is small this term is very important .",
    "it is easy to see that the above equation describes a 4-dimensional gravity with minor corrections , which implies that @xmath10 must have an energy scale as the planck one in the dgp model .",
    "for the cosmic energy , we assume that it has a constant equation of state @xmath25 and thus its density can be expressed as @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant . in the following ,",
    "we take @xmath28 or @xmath29 , which corresponds to the vacuum energy , radiation , or pressureless matter dominated universe , respectively .",
    "thus the friedmann equation becomes @xmath30 clearly , @xmath31 is required when @xmath32 , which means that the universe begins to evolve at @xmath33 rather than @xmath34 .",
    "so , the classical big bang singularity can be avoided .",
    "let us note that this finite size initial universe can be created from `` nothing '' through quantum tunneling  @xcite . for @xmath35 , @xmath36",
    "is needed and in this case the universe can originate from @xmath34 .",
    "now we rewrite the friedmann equation in the following form @xmath37 where @xmath38 thus @xmath39 can be regarded as a  potential \" and the scale factor @xmath5 changes as a particle moving in it .",
    "potential \" must satisfy the condition @xmath40 .",
    "this gives the possible range of @xmath5 when the universe evolves .",
    "therefore , we can classify the types of the universe by the signs of @xmath6 and @xmath41 , and by the values of other parameters .",
    "all cosmic evolution types in the dgp braneworld are :    \\(1 ) [ bounce ] : if @xmath40 for @xmath42 and the equality holds at @xmath43 , a spacetime initially contracts from an infinite scale , and it eventually turns around at the finite scale @xmath44 , and then expands forever ;    \\(2 ) [ oscillation ] : @xmath40 for @xmath45 $ ] and the equality occurs at @xmath46 and @xmath47 , a spacetime oscillates between two finite scale factors ;    \\(3 ) [ @xmath48 : @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",

    "a spacetime starts from a finite scale @xmath0 and expands .",
    "it turns around at @xmath57 and begins to contract .",
    "when the universe contracts to the minimum scale @xmath58 , it should expand again .",
    "however , its evolution will be discontinuous at @xmath58 since the potential @xmath59 .",
    "thus , there exists a new singularity in this type .",
    "if the universe is dominated by pressureless matter @xmath60 , the cosmic energy density can be expressed as @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the potential becomes @xmath62 clearly , @xmath63 and @xmath64 in general except for the case @xmath65 this condition gives a boundary to obtain an oscillating universe .",
    "a static universe appears if there is a solution @xmath66 which satisfies @xmath67 and @xmath68 . at @xmath69 , both the cosmic expansion speed and acceleration equal to zero and",
    "thus the universe can stay at this point if it is stable .",
    "differentiating @xmath70 with respect to @xmath5 , we have @xmath71 combining @xmath72 and @xmath73 , we obtain , to get a static universe , a relation between @xmath74 and other parameters : @xmath75 which gives another two boundaries for obtaining the oscillating universe .",
