    "the electron - electron interaction drives such a system into a mott insulating ground state  @xcite and dominates low - energy excitations .",
    "therefore , the optical properties of one - dimensional mott insulators are currently a topic of great interest .    despite many theoretical studies ,",
    "our knowledge of these systems is still fragmentary because of the difficulties associated with the investigation of strongly correlated systems . for many years",
    ", numerical exact diagonalization of small systems was the only method providing reliable information on excited states in correlated electron systems .",
    "@xcite recently , however , the linear optical conductivity and exciton properties of one - dimensional mott insulators have been calculated analytically for an infinite system in the limit of a small mott gap  @xcite and of a large mott gap .",
    "@xcite moreover , recent developments of the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method  @xcite allows one to calculate excited states and dynamical response functions numerically in large systems and with an accuracy comparable to exact diagonalizations .",
    "@xcite    a paradigm of a one - dimensional mott insulator is the extended hubbard model with hopping integral @xmath0 , on - site repulsion @xmath1 , and nearest - neighbor repulsion @xmath2 at half filling .",
    "although this model has been widely studied , its properties are still poorly understood in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is known  @xcite that the system is a mott insulator in a large region of the parameter space @xmath3 which is physically relevant for the coulomb repulsion between electrons @xmath4 .",
    "the precise ground - state phase diagram has only recently be determined using dmrg .",
    "@xcite in the special case of the hubbard model  @xcite ( @xmath5 ) the ground state is known exactly to be a mott insulator  @xcite and the optical conductivity has been calculated .",
    "@xcite in principle , the optical properties of the mott insulating phase are also known for @xmath6 at weak coupling  @xcite and at strong coupling ,  @xcite but the range of validity of these results is not clear a priori .",
    "results for intermediate coupling and close to the mott phase boundary @xmath7 are scarce and the absence of finite - size - effect analysis often hinders their interpretation .",

    "the comparison of numerical results for @xmath8 with field - theoretical  @xcite and strong - coupling  @xcite predictions confirms both the great accuracy of ddmrg and the wide validity range of both analytical methods .",
    "i have found that four types of excitations determine the optical properties in the mott insulating phase : pairs of unbound charge excitations , excitons , excitonic strings , and charge - density - wave ( cdw ) droplets .",
    "i will show that each type of excitations dominate the low - energy spectrum in a particular region of the parameter space @xmath3 and exhibits a distinct optical spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "the model , the linear optical conductivity @xmath8 , and the relevant symmetries are introduced in detail in the next section . in sec .",
    "[ sec : methods ] the numerical methods are briefly presented , then the estimation of dmrg truncation errors and finite - size effects are discussed . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] i describe the four different types of excitations which contribute to the linear optical conductivity and the corresponding optical spectra in the various interaction regimes from the limit of a large mott gap to the limit of a small mott gap .",
    "the final section contains the conclusion .",
    "the one - dimensional extended hubbard model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath9 it describes electrons with spin @xmath10 which can hop between neighboring sites .",
    "here @xmath11 , @xmath12 are creation and annihilation operators for electrons with spin @xmath13 at site @xmath14 , @xmath15 are the corresponding density operators , and @xmath16 .",
    "the hopping integral @xmath17 gives rise to a a single - electron band of width @xmath18 .",
    "the coulomb repulsion is mimicked by a local hubbard interaction @xmath1 , and a nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath2 .",
    "the physically relevant parameter regime is @xmath19 .",
    "the number of electrons equals the number of lattice sites @xmath20 ( half - filled band ) .",
    "this system is in a mott insulating phase for @xmath21  ( ref . ) .",
    "precise values of the mott phase boundary @xmath22 are given in ref .  .",
    "note that the chemical potential is chosen in such a way that the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) explicitly exhibits a particle - hole symmetry .",
    "this hamiltonian has two other discrete symmetries which are useful for optical excitation calculations : a spin - flip symmetry and a spatial reflection symmetry ( through the lattice center ) .",
    "therefore , each eigenstate has a well - defined parity under charge conjugation ( @xmath23 ) and spin flip ( @xmath24 ) , and belongs to one of the two irreducible representations , @xmath25 or @xmath26 , of a one - dimensional lattice reflection symmetry group .",
    "spectroscopy with electromagnetic radiation is a common experimental probe of solid - state materials .",
    "@xcite the linear ( one - photon ) optical absorption is proportional to the real part @xmath8 of the optical conductivity . for @xmath27 , @xmath8",

    "although @xmath37 is infinitesimal , a finite value may be used to broaden the resonances at @xmath38 and to reduce finite - size effects .",
    "@xmath39 is the current operator @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the charge of an electron .",
    "i set @xmath42 throughout , and @xmath43 is used in figures showing the optical conductivity , which means that @xmath8 is given in units of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in units of @xmath46 .",
    "we note that the current operator is invariant under the spin - flip transformation but antisymmetric under charge conjugation and spatial reflection . therefore , if the ground state @xmath32 belongs to the symmetry subspace @xmath47 , only excited states @xmath34 belonging to the symmetry subspace @xmath48 contribute to the optical conductivity .",
    "according to selection rules , the matrix element @xmath49 vanishes if @xmath34 belongs to another symmetry subspace . in this paper , the excitation energy @xmath50 of the lowest eigenstate with a non - zero matrix element @xmath49",
    "is called the optical gap @xmath51 .",
    "dmrg  @xcite is known to be a very accurate method for one - dimensional quantum systems with short - range interactions such as the extended hubbard hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) . in this work",
    "i use three different dmrg techniques to calculate ground states , excited states , and dynamic response functions .",
    "all three techniques are based on the finite system dmrg algorithm .",
    "first , the usual ground - state dmrg method is used to calculate the ground state @xmath32 for a fixed number @xmath52 of electrons of each spin @xmath13 .",
    "this method provides the ground - state energy @xmath53 and allows us to calculate ground - state expectation values @xmath54 for various operators @xmath55 , such as static correlation functions .",
    "the ( mott ) gap @xmath56 in the single - particle density of states of a mott insulator can also be obtained using this approach . at half filling ( @xmath57 ) the mott gap is simply given by @xmath58 \\label{chargegap}\\ ] ] because of the charge - conjugation symmetry .",
    "second , a symmetrized dmrg  @xcite technique is used to calculate the lowest eigenstates @xmath59 in the @xmath60 symmetry sector .",
    "this method yields not only the eigenenergies @xmath36 of the lowest optically excited states ( in particular , the optical gap @xmath51 ) , but also allow us to compute expectation values @xmath61 and thus to analyze the nature of these states . to optimize the dmrg program performance , my implementation of the charge - conjugation and spin - flip symmetries differs from the original idea presented in ref .  .",
    "this is explained in detail in appendix .",
    "finally , the dynamical dmrg method  @xcite is used to compute the optical conductivity  ( [ sigma ] ) convolved with a lorentzian distribution of width @xmath62 .",
    "comparisons with exact results have shown that ddmrg is a very reliable numerical method , which yields spectra with an accuracy comparable to exact diagonalizations but for much larger systems .",
    "@xcite    all dmrg methods have a truncation error which is reduced by increasing the number  @xmath63 of density - matrix eigenstates kept ( for more details , see refs .   and ) .",
    "varying @xmath63 allows one to compute physical quantities ( including spectra ) for different truncation errors and thus to obtain error estimates on these quantities .",
    "i have systematically used this procedure to estimate the precision of my numerical calculations and adjusted the maximal number @xmath63 of density - matrix states to reach a desired accuracy .",
    "the largest number of density - matrix eigenstates used in this work is @xmath64 . for all numerical results presented in this paper dmrg truncation errors",
    "are negligible .",
    "all numerical calculations have been performed on lattices with an even number @xmath20 of sites using open boundary conditions .",
    "as we are interested in the properties of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the thermodynamic limit , numerical calculations have always been carried out for several system sizes @xmath20 in order to investigate finite - size effects .",
    "the largest system size used here is @xmath65 .",
    "if necessary , the results have been extrapolated to the infinite system limit @xmath66 . to evaluate finite - size effects in a continuous spectrum one",
    "has to compute it for different sizes while keeping @xmath67 = const .",
    "@xcite in this work @xmath68 is used . for all numerical results presented in this paper finite - size effects ( including chain - end effects )",
    "are negligible unless discussed explicitly . for spectra",
    "this means that finite - size effects are completely hidden by the broadening @xmath69 .",
    "more precisely , ddmrg results for finite @xmath70 are not distinguishable from the corresponding infinite - system spectra convolved with a lorentzian distribution of width @xmath69 ( see the discussion in ref .  ) .",
    "to facilitate the comparison with analytical results , the discussion of optical excitations in the mott insulating phase is divided in three subsections : the limit of a large mott gap , the regime of finite mott gaps , and the limit of a small mott gap .",
    "note , however , that the mott gap @xmath71 just fixes the energy scale ; the minimal energy required to create a charge excitation is @xmath72 but optical excitations do not differ qualitatively as @xmath71 varies if everything else is kept constant . in all cases , there is spin - charge separation and the spin sector is gapless .",
    "elementary excitations in the charge sector are spinless bosons in the lower and upper hubbard bands .",
    "optical excitations are always made of an even number ( @xmath73 ) of elementary excitations with opposite charges ( to preserve charge neutrality ) .",
    "the different types of optical excitations and optical spectra found in the model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) result from the residual interactions ( essentially the non - local part of the coulomb repulsion , here @xmath2 ) between the elementary charge excitations .      in the strong - coupling limit @xmath74",
    ", the properties of the model  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) in the mott insulating phase can be described using simple concepts . in the ground state double occupation",
    "is prohibited and there is exactly one electron on each site .",
    "elementary charge excitations can be represented as an empty site ( holon in the lower hubbard band ) or a doubly occupied site ( doublon in the upper hubbard band ) .",
    "the minimal energy required to create a holon or a doublon is @xmath75 .",
    "optical excitations always consist of an equal number of holons and doublons to conserve the total charge .",
    "the ionicity of excited states is defined as the change in the number of doubly occupied sites with respect to the ground state @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 denote the ground state and excited states , respectively .",
    "thus , @xmath79 is a measure of the number of doublons ( or equivalently of holons ) created by an excitation .",
    "depending on the strength of the nearest - neighbor interaction parameter @xmath2 , the low - energy optical excitations are made of a single doublon - holon pair ( @xmath80 ) or are collective excitations of several such pairs ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "note that @xmath79 is also equal to the derivative of the excitation energy @xmath82 with respect to @xmath1 .      for @xmath83",
    ", optical excitations consist of a single holon - doublon pair and the optical properties , which can be calculated exactly ,  @xcite depend only on the parameters @xmath2 and @xmath0 . for @xmath84 ,",
    "holon and doublon are independent . a schematic representation of this state is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "this pair of free charge excitations gives rise to a continuous band in the optical spectrum @xmath8 .",
    "the band starts at the mott gap @xmath85 and has a width of @xmath86 .",
    "as there is no optical excitation with a lower energy than @xmath71 , the mott gap is also the optical gap @xmath51 .",

    "@xcite this peak is visible inside the band for @xmath87 and @xmath88 in fig .",
    "it corresponds to a bound state made of dispersionless charge excitations  @xcite and can be seen as a localized exciton with size @xmath94 .     schematic representation of ( a ) an unbound holon - doublon pair , ( b ) an exciton , and ( c ) a biexciton in the strong - coupling limit @xmath95.,width=188 ]    for @xmath96 , there is also a continuous band starting at @xmath97 due to independent holon - doublon pairs , but the lowest optical excitation is now an exciton ( i.e. , a bound holon - doublon pair ) with an energy @xmath98 ( ref . ) .",
    "the term @xmath99 is the kinetic energy lowering due to the exciton center - of - mass motion .",
    "therefore , in the strong - coupling limit ( @xmath74 ) the exciton binding energy is @xmath100 ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "this binding energy significantly differs from the incorrect result @xmath101 often reported in the literature ,  @xcite which is ( approximately ) valid only under the additional condition @xmath102 . in the optical spectrum @xmath8",
    "the exciton generates an isolated @xmath103-peak at @xmath104 below the band onset .",
    "for @xmath102 , an exciton is essentially the nearest - neighbor holon - doublon pair shown in fig .",
    "this is exactly the state generated by the current operator  ( [ current ] ) applied to the ground state with one electron on each site .",
    "thus the spectral weight is concentrated in the excitonic peak for @xmath102 .",
    "this strong excitonic peak is already clearly visible for @xmath105 in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . for finite @xmath106 , however , there is a finite probability of finding holon and doublon at a distance @xmath107 .",

    "the exciton size ( the average holon - doublon distance ) is then @xmath111 and decreases as @xmath2 increases .",
    "correspondingly , one observes a progressive transfer of spectral weight from the band above @xmath71 to the excitonic peak at @xmath112 as @xmath2 increases .",
    "note that , as for @xmath113 , there is a small peak corresponding to a localized exciton at @xmath93 in the optical conductivity .",

    "the ddmrg spectra are indistinguishable from the analytical results for an infinite system .",

    ") this perfect agreement confirms the validity of the strong - coupling calculations done in ref .  .",
    "moreover , it confirms once more that ddmrg can accurately reproduce infinite - system optical spectra .",
    "@xcite      as we have just seen , the creation energy of an excited state with ionicity @xmath118 is either @xmath119 for an unbound holon - doublon pair or @xmath120 for an exciton .",
    "once a first excitation has been created , however , the creation of a second holon - doublon pair bound to the first excitation requires only an energy @xmath121 .",
    "therefore , when @xmath2 becomes large enough , the lowest optical excitations are bound states of @xmath122 excitons , called excitonic strings .",

    "the reason is that for any finite @xmath0 there are quantum charge fluctuations ( virtual holon - doublon pairs ) in all eigenstates of the hamiltonian  ( [ hamiltonian ] ) which leads to small but finite matrix elements @xmath136 even if the average ionicity @xmath79 of an excitation @xmath140 exceeds one , @xmath141 thus , for @xmath142 the low - energy optical spectrum consists of a strong excitonic peak at @xmath143 followed by several [ @xmath144 weaker isolated @xmath103-peaks with exponentially decreasing spectral weight at @xmath145 .",

    ", excitonic strings retain a well - defined size represented by an integer number @xmath122 because the kinetic energy lowering @xmath147 due to size fluctuations is much smaller than the energy cost @xmath148 per exciton in the string .",
    "close to the phase boundary ( @xmath149 ) between the cdw ground state and the mott insulator ,  @xcite however , size fluctuations become advantageous .",
    "thus , for @xmath150 low - energy excitations ( of the mott insulator ) are cdw droplets , which can be understood as superpositions of excitonic strings of every size , @xmath151 with a broad distribution of coefficients @xmath152 ( @xmath153 ) .",

    "contrary to excitonic strings , the ionicity @xmath166 of a cdw droplet is not a integer number but can take any value @xmath167 .",
    "therefore , for @xmath168 there is a band of cdw droplet excitations starting at @xmath169 .",
    "moreover , the matrix element @xmath136 for a cdw droplet @xmath140 is essentially given by the overlap @xmath170 with the single exciton state in eq .",
    "( [ droplet ] ) . thus in this regime one expects that the cdw droplets give rise to a band in the optical spectrum @xmath8 starting at @xmath171 .",
