    "their period derivative can be as high as @xmath8 .",
    "this may be due to their strong surface dipole field , which may lie in the range of @xmath9 ( olausen & kaspi 2014 ) .",
    "the multipole field of magnetars can be even higher than their surface dipole field . the release of magnetic energy powers both the bursts ( including giant flares ) , and persistent emissions of magnetars ( beloborodov 2009 ; vigano et al .",

    "recently , the central compact object ( cco ) in supernova remnant rcw 103 is found to be a magnetar ( dai et al . 2016 ; rea et al .",
    "the magnetar - like burst , outburst , and transient hard x - ray emissions all resemble those of classical magnetars ( rea & esposito 2011 ) .",
    "however , this magnetar ( 1e 161348@xmath105055 ) may have a rotational period of @xmath11 hours ( de luca et al .",
    "the most recent observations also point to a rotational origin for this very long period ( dai et al . 2016 ; rea et al . 2016 ) .",
    "this super - slow magnetar may be spun - down by additional torques from a fallback disk ( de luca et al . 2006 ; li 2007 ; rea et al . 2016 ) . however , no detailed calculations are available at present .",
    "furthermore , it is still unkown how to understand uniformly the three different kinds of magnetars at present : normal magnetars , magnetars with a passive fallback disks , and the super - slow magnetar with a rotational period of @xmath11 hours .    in this letter , the rotational evolution of magnetars in the presence of a fallback disk is calculated .",
    "it is found that the three different kinds of magnetars can by understood uniformly by a different combination of disk mass and magnetar dipole magnetic field .",
    "one aspect of the fallback disk model is to explain the persistent x - ray and timing observations of magnetars . in the fallback disk model of chatterjee",
    "et al . ( 2000 ) , alpar ( 2001 ) , the central star is a normal neutron star with surface dipole magnetic field of @xmath12 .",
    "the accretion from the fallback disk provides both the x - ray luminosity and spin - down torque of the neutron star .",
    "there is no magnetar in these models .",

    "according to menou et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , the time scale may be determined by the viscous time scale @xmath22 for typical parameters of the disk .",
    "the power law index is @xmath23 for opacity dominated by electron scattering , and @xmath24 for a kramers opacity ( cannizzo et al .",
    "chatterjee et al . ( 2000 ) chose @xmath25 .",
    "while during the main life time of the fallback disk , the kramers opacity may be more relevant ( francischelli & wijers 2002 ; li 2007 ) and @xmath18 should be @xmath26 .",
    "3 .   during the early time , the mass accretion rate can be highly super - eddington .",
    "chatterjee et al . ( 2000 ) used the mass accretion rate without considering the eddington limit .",

    "( 2012 ) , the mass accrete at the inner edge of the disk should be limit by the eddington accretion rate , which is chosen as @xmath27 in the following calculations .",
    "denote the time when the mass accretion rate equals the eddington accretion rate as @xmath28 , the mass accretion accretion rate at the inner edge of the disk is : @xmath29 this mass accretion rate @xmath30 determines the interaction between the fallback disk and the neutron star . since @xmath28 is always larger than @xmath17 , it is @xmath31 for a chosen time scale @xmath17 , the mass accretion rate @xmath30 is sole determined by the initial disk mass , which may ranges from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ( chevalier 1989 ; lin et al .",

    ", the neutron star will lose angular momentum by pushing away the accreted matter to infinity .",
    "when the magnetospheric radius is smaller than corotation radius , the accretion flow can fall onto the neutron star . in this accretion phase , the neutron star will gain angular momentum .",

    "the dipole magnetic field of magnetars can be in the range @xmath53 .",

    ". there may be two reasons for this discrepancy : ( 1 ) the reported upper limit may be contaminated by the timing noise .",

    "this may account for the existence of normal radio pulsars and radio quiet pulsars ( for example ccos ) ( geppert et al .",
    "1999 ; geppert 2009 ; vigano & pons 2012 ) .",
    "however , magnetar s high magnetic field and rapid rotation can prevent accretion onto the central neutron star , even when the accretion is hypercritical ( geppert 2009 ) . for neutron stars in x - ray binaries ,",
    "an empirical relation for the accretion induced magnetic field decay is : @xmath80 ( shibazaki et al . 1989 ; zhang & kojima 2006 ) , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the reduced magnetic field after accretion and the initial magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath83 is the accreted mass . for a typical disk mass of @xmath84 ,",
    "the disk mass itself is relatively small .",
    "furthermore , from figure [ gp_mass ] , at the ejector phase and propeller phase , most of the accreted matter can not fall onto the neutron star .",

    "the evolution of the magnetar magnetic field is negligible in the case of a fallback disk .",

    "therefore , the accreting magnetar scenario is also employed to explain the super - slow x - ray pulsars ( popov & turolla 2012 ; wang 2013 ) .    in the above calculations , the fallback disk will affect the rotational evolution of the magnetars only when the disk mass is substantial and the dipole magnetic field is very high .",
    "otherwise , the fallback disk is either negligible or can only been seen as a passive fallback disk .",
    "only two magnetars has possible fallback disks observed , this may due to magnetar s relatively low magnetospheric activities in the optical / infrared band and high x - ray luminosity ( wang et al .",

    "if the dipole field of the super - slow magnetar in rcw 103 is found to be inconsistent with the calculations here , it may imply that our current understanding of magnetars and/or fallback disks is still not perfect .    in conclusion , for the rotational evolution of magnetars in the presence of a fallback disk , three different kinds of magnetars",
