    "during many years , there has been a continuing interest for some generalizations @xcite of a classical nonlinear oscillator @xcite , which was introduced as a one - dimensional analogue of some quantum field theoretical models , and for the corresponding extensions @xcite of its quantum version @xcite .",
    "such a model is indeed an interesting example of a system with nonlinear oscillations with a frequency showing amplitude dependence .",
    "furthermore , since it contains both a nonlinear potential and a position - dependent mass , it is amenable to applications in those areas wherein the harmonicity of vibrations breaks down , such as in high - energy molecular states , or wherein a position - dependent effective mass is a useful concept , such as in many condensed - matter systems or many - body problems .    in 2004 ,",
    "cariena , raada , santander , and senthilvelan introduced a two - dimensional ( and more generally @xmath0-dimensional ) classical generalization @xcite of the one - dimensional model of @xcite .",
    "they established that the nonlinearity parameter @xmath1 , entering the definition of the potential and the position - dependent mass , can be interpreted as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the curvature of the two - dimensional space , so that their model actually describes a harmonic oscillator on the sphere ( for @xmath4 ) and on the hyperbolic plane ( for @xmath5 ) .",
    "they presented the solutions of the euler - lagrange equations in cartesian coordinates , showed that the system is superintegrable and that the hamilton - jacobi equations are separable in three different coordinate systems .",
    "later on , the quantum version of this classical model was also exactly solved in the corresponding three coordinate systems , wherein the schrdinger equation is separable @xcite .    in the present letter , we deepen our understanding on these two - dimensional classical and quantum models by providing an update on their analysis in polar coordinates .    in @xcite ,",
    "the euler - lagrange equations in cartesian coordinates were so complicated that they could not be directly solved in a simple way .",
    "some particular expressions were then assumed for the solutions and the undetermined parameters they contained were shown to satisfy some constraints by inserting such expressions in the equations .",
    "here we plan to prove that , in contrast , the euler - lagrange equations in polar coordinates simplify considerably , so that their solutions can be systematically derived .",
    "furthermore , in the solutions of the quantum model in polar coordinates @xcite , the precise nature of the classical orthogonal polynomials entering the bound - state radial wavefunctions was not determined .",
    "we will complete this analysis here , thereby extending to two dimensions a recent study @xcite , wherein the quantum one - dimensional model of @xcite and @xcite was re - examined .",
    "in cartesian coordinates @xmath6 , @xmath7 , the lagrangian of @xcite can be written as @xmath8    - \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\alpha^2 ( x^2+y^2)}{1 + \\lambda(x^2+y^2)},\\ ] ] where @xmath1 may be positive or negative and @xmath9 is some real constant that we may assume positive . in polar coordinates , it can be rewritten as @xmath10 where the angular momentum @xmath11 is a constant of the motion .",
    "considering now the euler - lagrange equations , we get a single differential equation to solve , namely @xmath12 since the constancy of @xmath13 ensures that the other equation with respect to @xmath14 is automatically satisfied . to solve ( [ eq : e - l ] ) , we proceed in two steps .    first ,",
    "on setting @xmath15 , we obtain a first - order equation for @xmath16 , @xmath17 whose general solution is given by @xmath18 in terms of some integration constant @xmath19 .",
    "second , from ( [ eq : p^2 ] ) , we get the differential equation @xmath20 which can be easily integrated by taking into account the sign of the discriminant @xmath21 whenever @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "the solutions for @xmath23 can then be inverted to yield @xmath24 .",
    "finally , the integration of the first - order differential equation @xmath25 @xcite provides the functions @xmath26 for @xmath27 in terms of some constant @xmath28 ( since for @xmath29 , @xmath14 remains constant ) .    to write some physically - relevant results",
    ", it is worth observing that the value of the integration constant @xmath19 is directly related to the energy @xmath30 of the system .",
    "the latter is indeed given by @xmath31   \\label{eq : e}\\ ] ] and insertion of ( [ eq : p^2 ] ) in ( [ eq : e ] ) leads to @xmath32 on the other hand , eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath33 where the constancy of @xmath13 allows us to group the term @xmath34 , coming from the kinetic energy , with the potential @xmath35 $ ] to define an effective potential @xmath36 .",
    "the possible values of @xmath30 , and consequently of @xmath19 , are determined by the behaviour of @xmath36 , where for @xmath37 , @xmath38 varies on the interval @xmath39 , while for @xmath40 , it is restricted to @xmath41 . according to whether @xmath29 or @xmath42 , @xmath36 goes to 0 or @xmath43 for @xmath44 . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath36 goes to @xmath45 for @xmath46 if @xmath37 or to @xmath43 for @xmath47 if @xmath40 .",
    "moreover , it can be easily shown that for @xmath42 , @xmath36 has a minimum @xmath48 at @xmath49 or @xmath41 ( according to which case applies ) . note that in the @xmath37 case , such a minimum only exists for @xmath13 values such that @xmath50 , thereby showing that bounded trajectories are restricted to low angular momentum values .",
    "it is worth pointing out that such a limitation on bounded motions for @xmath37 was not reported in @xcite and that for @xmath29 , one may set @xmath51 . in figs .  1 and 2 ,",
    "some examples are plotted for @xmath37 and @xmath40 , respectively .    , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath29 ( dashed line ) and @xmath54 ( solid line ) . ]    , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath29 ( dashed line ) and @xmath54 ( solid line ) . ]    the restrictions on the constants @xmath19 , @xmath57 , and @xmath58 of eq .",

    "completed the solution of the euler - lagrange equations in polar coordinates , we may connect it with that in cartesian coordinates presented in @xcite .",
    "this is the purpose of the next section .",

    "let us first compare the solution in polar coordinates for bounded trajectories with @xmath86 , given in ( [ eq : sol-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : e - omega ] ) , with the corresponding one in cartesian coordinates , expressed in ( [ eq : c - sol-1 ] ) and ( [ eq : c - rel-1 ] ) . to start with , direct comparison of the results obtained for the energy in ( [ eq : e - omega ] ) and ( [ eq : c - rel-1 ] ) yields @xmath87 for the angular frequency of the motion , as it should be",

    "the connection between the two approaches will be established by expressing the former in terms of the latter .    from the equation derived from @xmath91",
