    "the exploration of the behaviour of the nucleus under extreme conditions ; high spin , vicinity to the drip lines , finite temperature , etc . is a major source of new insights in nuclear structure .",
    "one of the most important questions raised by the study of the drip lines is whether the basic shell order evolves with the neutron ( proton ) excess an example of this problem is given by the n=20 very neutron rich nuclei where the strong anomalies detected@xcite were explained as a collapse of the standard n=20 shell closure .",
    "extended shell model calculations @xcite showed that the inversion of the spherical closed - shell configurations and the 2p-2h collective intruders could account for the large binding energies and half - lives , unexpected ground - state spins , and high level densities at low excitation energies .",
    "also , mean - field calculations using the skyrme interaction predicted a sharp transition from spherical to prolate shapes@xcite    recently , there has been an increase of interest in the n=28 isotones far from the stability , motivated by ; i ) the possible existence of anomalies in the shell closures , as already found in n=20 and ii ) the unusual @xmath6ca/@xmath7ca abundance ratio measured in the solar system or the ca - ti - cr anomalies observed in some meteoritic inclusions .",
    "sorlin et al .",
    "@xcite undertook the study of the @xmath8-decay and @xmath8-delayed neutron emission probabilities for @xmath9s and @xmath10cl .",
    "their measured half - lives were much larger than those predicted by tda@xcite or qrpa@xcite calculations .",
    "these discrepancies were attributed to unexpected shape transitions in the region .",
    "mass formulas such as the finite - range liquid drop@xcite , the finite - range droplet@xcite or the extended thomas - fermi with shell corrections @xcite predict the existence of shape coexistence around @xmath9s . in all the cases the energy surfaces are very soft with close lying minima corresponding to different deformations .",
    "similar conclusions have been drawn by werner et al@xcite .",
    "relativistic mean field calculations and non - relativistic ones using the skyrme forces produce very flat energy surfaces for the sulphur isotopes , with several minima separated by energy barriers of just a few hundred kev . in this his situation",
    "it seems necessary to go beyond the mean - field using , for instance , the generator coordinate method .    in this paper",
    "we discuss all the neutron rich nuclei with n@xmath11 and @xmath12z@xmath13 in the shell model framework .",
    "this is , to some extent , complementary to the other methods mentioned above and can give new information on the structure of these nuclei .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii gives a brief description of the model , discussing the choice of the valence space , the effective interaction and the coulomb corrections .",
    "section iii compares our results with the experimental data . in section",
    "iv we examine the behaviour of the n=28 shell closure far from the stability .",
    "section v deals with deformation in heavy sulphur isotopes .",
    "it consists of the full @xmath0 shell for z-8 protons and the full @xmath1 shell for n-20 neutrons .",
    "although the calculations reach very large dimensionalities , they can be performed without truncations in all cases .",
    "we do not include the intruder states that could be formed by exciting particles from the @xmath0 to the @xmath1 shell .",
    "these kind of states , that appear at low excitation energy around @xmath2ca , should be less important near n=28 .",
    "the reason is twofold ; @xmath0 protons get more and more bound with increasing neutron excess then unfavouring proton intruders ; and the correlation energy of the configurations with neutron intruders do not gain much energy compared to the standard ones ( the opposite is true in e.g. @xmath14 mg ) .",
    "this is in agreement with the observed spectra .",
    "the existence of many collective low lying states near n = z=20 contrast with their absence for n@xmath15 , z@xmath16 .",
    "the construction of the effective hamiltonian is critical in any shell model description .",
    "it is well known that the saturation properties of the realistic interactions must be corrected phenomelogically in order to have a good description of the nuclear structure@xcite .",
    "unfortunately , the experimental data for the very neutron rich nuclei with @xmath17z@xmath18 are scarce .",
    "even if the masses are known over a relatively wide region , at n=28 they have only been measured for nuclei with z@xmath19 . as an example",
    "the masses of the sulfur isotopes are only known up to n=26 .",
    "half - lives are only known for @xmath9s and @xmath10cl .",
    "the level schemes of ar and cl with @xmath20 are partly established .",
    "the situation is clearly better for the k isotopes where the evolution of of the @xmath21 doublet with the neutron number is known up to n=28@xcite .",
    "our starting interaction has three parts .",
    "the usd interaction of wildenthal@xcite is used for the particles lying in the sd - shell .",
    "a modified version of the kuo - brown interaction , denoted kb@xmath22 in ref @xcite , gives the two body matrix elements for the @xmath1 shell particles .",
    "this interaction is better suited to this valence space that the kb3 interaction that has been used in conventional @xmath1 shell calculations @xcite .",
    "furthermore , when used in the lower part of the @xmath1 shell it also gives good spectroscopic results . finally , the cross - shell interaction is the g - matrix of lee , kahanna and scott ( lks)@xcite . this is the part of the interaction whose monopoles we have proceeded to modify phenomenologically .",
    "the data used in the fit are :    * the natural parity states of nuclei with few @xmath1 particles and sd holes . * the evolution of the @xmath21 doublet along the k isotopes . *",
    "the position of the 5/2@xmath23 states in @xmath24k .",
    "the experimental data cited above are not enough to fix all the monopole parameters .",
    "they essentially fix the interaction among neutrons in the 1f@xmath25 and 2p@xmath26 orbits with the @xmath0 protons . on the contrary , the interaction with 1f@xmath27 and 2p@xmath28 particles is not well determined . in our choice of the final interaction @xmath29ca and @xmath30si",
    "have very similar single neutron spectra as predicted in duflo and zuker @xcite mass formula .",
    "there exists other possible choices of this part of the interaction that induce important modifications in the structure of heavy silicons and to a minor extent in that of the heavy sulphurs .",
    "the 2-body matrix elements incorporate a tiny mass dependence and are written as :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33=11 mev are used to calculate the lks g - matrix . instead of the usual law @xmath34 fm ,",
    "we borrow from reference @xcite a modified expression , which is better adapted to large mass regions .",
    "@xmath35^{1/3}.\\ ] ]    leading to the following expression for the 2-body matrix elements    @xmath36^{1/3}v_0\\ ] ]    with @xmath37 and @xmath32 .",
    "the absolute energies predicted with the precedent interaction are relative to an @xmath38 core and do not include the coulomb energy of the protons . thus , to compare our predictions with the experiment ,",
    "they must be corrected with the following prescription :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the inert core energy ( 127.62 mev ) , @xmath41 is the coulomb energy relative to the core and @xmath42 is the nuclear energy obtained with our interaction .",
    "the @xmath43 energy , which is assumed to depend only on n and z , has been calculated with the antony and pape formula@xcite    @xmath44    where @xmath45 or @xmath46 and the coulomb correction @xmath47 along the stability line is given by    @xmath48    which agrees with the chung - wildenthal coulomb correction@xcite when @xmath49 and with that of reference@xcite for @xmath50 .",
    "in this section we compare compare the theoretical predictions with the experimental data .",
    "the shell model matrices are dealt with by the code _ antoine _ @xcite a very fast and efficient implementation of the lanczos algorithm .",
    "the usd predictions for the @xmath0-shell nuclei have been largely reported @xcite .",
    "however , we shall include @xmath0 nuclei in the @xmath51 plots to stress the continuity of the shell model description across the n=20 magic number .",
    "table [ t1 ] , contains the predicted and experimental energies of the @xmath52 states , that show an excellent agreement . the interaction , adjusted to reproduce the behaviour of the 3/2@xmath23 , 1/2@xmath23 levels along the odd - a k , predicts for the doublet a similar behaviour in the neutron rich chlorine and phosphorous ( see table [ t2 ] ) .",
    "the crossing of these two levels is due to the gradual degeneracy of the 2s@xmath28 and 1d@xmath26 orbitals as the occupation of the 1f@xmath25 shell increases . in the p isotopes , the 1@xmath53 orbit is nearly closed",
    ", consequently the evolution of the doublet gives us an idea of the relative position of the two orbitals . as we shall comment later , their relative possition is determinant for the development of deformation in the heavy sulphurs .    the spectroscopic information on the nuclei with z@xmath54 n@xmath16 is limited to a some k , ar and cl isotopes . figures [ f1 ] to [ f7 ] show the theoretical and experimental spectra for the cases @xmath55k , @xmath56ar and @xmath57cl for which the energy levels are known .",
    "yet , there are still many uncertainties in the measured level schemes , specially the spin assignments .",
    "the theory - experiment agreement is perfect for @xmath58k and @xmath2ar .",
    "the few states without theoretical counterpart are most probably sd - intruders . for the other nuclei",
    "the concordance is also quite good .",
    "in addition to these spectra , the half - lives of several ar and s isotopes are known .",
    "their decays are dominated by allowed gamow teller transitions .",
    "the ground states of the father nuclei were calculated in our @xmath59 space and the gamow - teller sum rule state was determined in a larger space that includes all the @xmath60 in order to recover the @xmath61 sum rule .",
    "the strength functions were obtained by the whitehead method @xcite .",
    "the phase space factors of wilkinson@xcite were used to compute the half - lifes .",
    "total strengths and half - lives are compiled in table [ t3 ] .",
    "the agreement is very satisfactory .",
    "the calculated half - life of @xmath9s is very sensitive to the @xmath62 .",
    "we have used the theoretical value ; if we had employed the extrapolated number given in the audi and wapstra compilation @xcite , the half - life would have increased to 150@xmath63 .",
    "the two neutron separation energies s@xmath64 are known over a large region , unfortunately , for most z s they do not reach n=28 .",
    "the agreement with the experimental results is good as it can be seen in figures [ f8 ] to [ f12 ] .",
    "however , the discrepancies with the extrapolated masses @xcite are important .      to answer to this question we analyse our predictions for the s@xmath64 , the excitation energies of the first @xmath52 states , and the occupation numbers .",
    "structural changes , such as spherical to deformed shape transitions , should show up in the behaviour of these quantities as a function of the neutron number .",
    "the s@xmath64 s around n=28 have some common features for different z - values . in three cases : ca , k and si , a sharp decrease of s@xmath64",
    "is observed at n=28 . for the other isotopes ,",
    "there are not sharp slope changes , but s@xmath64 still decreases",
    ". these results are consistent with a shell closure .",
    "this conclusion is opposite to that coming from the mass systematics , that predicts almost constant s@xmath64 around n=28 , and thar could be interpreted as a signature of a new region of deformation .",
    "figure [ f13 ] shows the evolution of the 2@xmath23 energy for the ca and si isotopes .",
    "the large energy increase of the 2@xmath23 for the four nuclei @xmath2ca , @xmath6ca , @xmath65s and @xmath3si is something that typifies doubly magic nuclei .",
    "notice , however , that the effect is smaller for the exotic @xmath3si .",
    "a similar evidence comes from the 1f@xmath25 occupation numbers along n=28 .",
    "those , shown in figure [ f14 ] , reveal an increase of the f@xmath25 occupation at z=20 and z=14 , again slightly in @xmath3si .",
    "the 2@xmath23 excitation energies of the isotopes of ar and s , around n=28 , are presented fig .",
    "[ f15 ] and compared with the corresponding energies of nuclei much closer to the stability at those neutron numbers ( ti , cr ) .",
    "there is an upward shift of the excitation energies at n=28 that is a little smaller in ar and s. the behaviour is seen to be very similar close and far off stability , thus indicating that the n=28 closure stands in the very neutron rich region .    from the analysis of these three sets of results : s@xmath64 , e@xmath66 and the occupation numbers we can conclude that the 1f@xmath67 neutron configuration at n=28 , although somewhat eroded by the large neutron excess , is still dominant and that @xmath3si is a new doubly magic nuclei .",
    "therefore , the vanishing of the shell closure far from stability that happens at n=20 , does not seem to occur at n=28 .",
    "our calculations show the existence of low lying 2@xmath23 states for the ar and s isotopes with @xmath68n@xmath69 .",
    "however , only the sulphur isotopes have large ( and negative ) spectroscopic quadrupole moments and enhanced e2 transitions ( see figs .",
    "18 and 19 ) .",
    "@xmath3ar and @xmath9ar have reasonably large be2 s but very small spectroscopic quadrupole moments .",
    "the lowest 2@xmath23 energies correspond to @xmath2s and @xmath3s .",
    "their spectroscopic quadrupole moments are -17.1e@xmath70fm@xmath70 and -19.2e@xmath70fm@xmath70 respectively . assuming that the bohr - mottelson formula for the intrinsic quadrupole moment is applicable , we get q@xmath72=59.8 e@xmath70fm@xmath70 for @xmath2s and q@xmath72=67.2 e@xmath70fm@xmath70 for @xmath3s , corresponding to deformation parameters @xmath73 0.29 and @xmath74 0.32 .",
    "our results are consistent with the relativistic mean field calculations of werner _",
    "_ , which predict @xmath75 .",
    "their non - relativistic calculations point to a more complicated situation with nearly degenerate prolate ( @xmath75 ) and oblate ( @xmath76 ) solutions .",
    "the only indication of coexistence in our results is provided by the presence of a very low ( 1.51 mev ) second 0@xmath77 state in @xmath9s .",
    "the values of the e2 reduced transition probabilities are 77.9 e@xmath70@xmath78 ( a=40 ) and 93.0 e@xmath70@xmath78 ( a=42 ) .",
    "we compare the quadrupole moments of @xmath3s and other nuclei near n=28 in figure [ f14 ] .",
    "the value for @xmath3s is about 2/3 of that predicted for @xmath6cr leading to very similar deformation parameters @xmath790.32 and @xmath790.30 .",
    "in addition , the yrast levels of @xmath3s follow the rotational law j(j+1 ) up to j=6 .",
    "it is also important to notice that , although a truncated 1f@xmath25 2p@xmath26 valence space for the neutrons , contains the basic degrees of freedom for the description of deformed nuclei in this region , it enhances either the rotational behaviour or the closed shell features , depending on the basic configurations that are involved . as an example let consider the evolution of the @xmath52 excitation energies of the sulphur isotopes . in the truncated space",
    "the energy of the @xmath52 in n=26 goes down 200 kev to 0.88 mev while in n=28 it goes up 300 kev to 1.78 mev .    in order to explain the onset of deformation we shall explore which are the configurations that are responsible for the quadrupole coherence in our space .",
    "it is well known that the su(3 ) symmetry is broken by the strong @xmath80 coupling in the pf shell .",
    "yet , it has been recently shown @xcite that the subspaces of a major shell spanned by @xmath81 orbits develop an approximate su(3 ) symmetry , named quasi - su(3 ) .",
    "for instance the 1f@xmath25 2p@xmath26 valence space is enough to to explain the collective behaviour of nuclei in the @xmath1 shell . in this space",
    "the maximal quadrupole collectivity is obtained for configurations with 4 protons and 4 neutrons . in our case ,",
    "the basic neutron degrees of freedom are contained in this space , but protons are confined in the @xmath0 shell . for the nuclei we are interested in ,",
    "the orbit 1d@xmath27 is essentially closed and only the 1d@xmath26 and the 2s@xmath28 can be considered active . in this situation neither su(3 ) nor quasi - su(3 ) can develop .    however , one must look more carefully at the behaviour of these two orbits .",
    "as far as the neutrons are filling the @xmath0 shell , both orbits remain well separated .",
    "for instance , the excitation energy of the @xmath82 level in @xmath83p and @xmath30p are 1.39 and 2.62 mev respectively .",
    "thus , the ground state wave functions are dominated by configurations with the maximum allowed number of particles in the 2s@xmath28 orbit .",
    "particularly , for @xmath84s the ( 2s@xmath85 configuration represents the 89@xmath86 of the wave function .",
    "when the neutrons begin to fill the @xmath1 shell , the two orbitals become more and more degenerate ( see table [ t1 ] ) inducing strong mixing in the wave functions . a valence space with degenerate 1d@xmath26 and 2s@xmath28 orbitals",
    "has the geometry of pseudo - su(3 ) , and maximal quadrupole coherence is obtained for two protons , i.e , for the sulphur isotopes . for three particles",
    "the quadrupole moment is strictly zero and beyond it changes of sign leading to oblate shapes .",
    "thus , we expect other nuclei as , for instance , the ar isotopes to have small colectivity .",
    "notice , however , that strict degeneration is achieved only at n=28 , where the neutron collectivity is rather small .",
    "in other words , there is a mismatch between the region where protons have collective wave functions ( n=28 ) and the region were neutrons have quadrupole collectivity , that prevents the existence of a larger region of deformation .",
    "a compromise seems to take place for z=16 and n=26 ( @xmath3s ) or n=24 ( @xmath2s ) .",
    "in this paper we have studied the n=28 region far from the stability . we have built an effective interaction for @xmath0 active protons and @xmath1 active neutrons that is the natural generalization of successful @xmath0-only and @xmath1-only interactions .",
    "the agreement of the theoretical results and the experimental data is very satisfactory .",
    "however , much more experimental information is needed to obtain a complete understanding of the region .",
    "accurate information on the @xmath52 excitation energies , on the evolution of the @xmath87 doublet along the cl and p chains , the single particle spectrum of @xmath30si are challenges for the physics of exotic nuclei .",
    "we have also addressed the question of the magicity of n=28 . a detailed analysis of the @xmath88 , @xmath52 energies and occupation numbers allow us to conclude that it persists in the very neutron rich regime , contrary to what happens at n=20 .",
    "finally our results show that the @xmath89s isotopes are well deformed , but the effect seems to be very local ; no large region of deformation is therefore expected",
