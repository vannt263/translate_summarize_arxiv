    "we say that an @xmath2-vertex graph is _ @xmath0-distance - uniform _ if there is a value @xmath1 , called the _",
    "critical distance _ , such that , for every vertex @xmath5 , all but @xmath6 of the other vertices are at distance exactly @xmath1 from @xmath5 .",
    "this notion is introduced by alon , demaine , hajiaghayi , and leighton in @xcite , motivated by the analysis of network creation games .    in a network creation game , according to a model proposed by fabrikant et al .  in  @xcite ,",
    "a graph is constructed and modified by independently acting nodes .",
    "each node must pay a creation cost to add nodes to the graph , but once the graph is built , each node must pay usage costs depending on how well - connected it is to other nodes in the graph .",
    "( this can be modeled in various ways , but we will take the usage cost to be a node s total distance to all other nodes . ) research in this area focuses on comparing the total cost to the nodes when this game is played to the optimal value of this cost over all graphs .",
    "the ratio between these quantities is known as the price of anarchy , a term first used by koutsoupias and papadimitriou  @xcite .",
    "alon et al .",
    "simplify the problem by starting with an existing graph , and allowing each node @xmath5 to perform edge swaps , adding one edge @xmath7 and deleting another edge @xmath8 ; this lets us separate creation costs from usage costs .",
    "a graph is said to be in sum equilibrium when no node can decrease its total distance to other nodes by any edge swap .",
    "if this network creation game terminates , it ends with a graph in sum equilibrium ; as a result , the price of anarchy is given by comparing the worst - case and best - case sum equilibrium graph .",
    "alon et al .",
    "show that sufficiently large graph powers of a graph in sum equilibrium will result in distance - uniform graphs ; if the critical distance is large , then the original sum equilibrium graph imposed a high total cost on its nodes .",
    "this application motivates the already natural question : in an @xmath0-distance - uniform graph with @xmath2 vertices and critical distance @xmath1 , what is the relationship between the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath1 ? specifically , can we derive an upper bound on @xmath1 in terms of @xmath0 and @xmath2 ?",
    "up to a constant factor , this is equivalent to finding an upper bound on the diameter of the graph , which must be between @xmath1 and @xmath9 as long as @xmath10 .",
    "random graphs provide one example of distance - uniform graphs . in @xcite",
    ", bollobs shows that for sufficiently large @xmath11 , the diameter of the random erds ",
    "rnyi random graph @xmath12 is asymptotically almost surely concentrated on one of two values . in fact , from every vertex @xmath5 in @xmath12 , the breadth - first search tree expands by a factor of @xmath13 at every layer , reaching all or almost all vertices after about @xmath14 steps . such a graph is also expected to be distance - uniform : the biggest layer of the breadth - first search tree will be much bigger than all previous layers .",
    "more precisely , suppose that we choose @xmath15 so that the average degree @xmath16 satisfies two criteria : that @xmath17 , and that for some @xmath1 , @xmath18 approaches a constant @xmath19 as @xmath20",
    ". then it follows from lemma  3 in @xcite that ( with probability @xmath21 ) for every vertex @xmath5 in @xmath12 , the number of vertices at each distance @xmath22 from @xmath5 is @xmath23 .",
    "it follows from theorem  6 in @xcite that the number of vertex pairs in @xmath12 at distance @xmath24 from each other is poisson with mean @xmath25 , so there are only @xmath26 such pairs with probability @xmath21 . as a result ,",
    "such a random graph is @xmath0-distance - uniform with @xmath27 , and critical distance @xmath28 .",
    "this example provides a compelling image of what distance - uniform graphs look like : if the breadth - first search tree from each vertex grows at the same constant rate , then most other vertices will be reached in the same step . in any graph that is distance - uniform for a similar reason , the critical distance",
    "@xmath1 will be at most logarithmic in @xmath2 .",
    "in fact , alon et al .",
    "conjecture that all distance - uniform graphs have diameter @xmath29 .",
    "alon et al .",
    "prove an upper bound of @xmath30 in a special case : for @xmath0-distance - uniform graphs with @xmath31 that are cayley graphs of abelian groups . in this case",
    ", if @xmath32 is the cayley graph of an abelian group @xmath33 with respect to a generating set @xmath34 , one form of plnnecke s inequality ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) says that the sequence @xmath35 is decreasing in @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 are precisely the sets of vertices which can be reached by @xmath38 steps from 0 , this inequality quantifies the idea of constant - rate growth in the breadth - first search tree ; theorem  15 in  @xcite makes this argument formal .    in this paper",
    ", we disprove alon et al.s conjecture by constructing distance - uniform graphs that do not share this behavior , and whose diameter is exponentially larger than these examples .",
    "we also prove an upper bound on the critical distance ( and diameter ) showing our construction to be best possible , in one asymptotic sense , for a wide range of @xmath0 .",
    "specifically , we show the following two results :    [ thm : intro - upper ] in any @xmath0-distance - uniform graph with @xmath2 vertices and @xmath39 , the critical distance @xmath1 satisfies @xmath40    [ thm : intro - lower ] for any @xmath0 and @xmath2 with @xmath3 , there exists an @xmath0-distance - uniform graph on @xmath2 vertices with critical distance @xmath41    combined , these results prove that the maximum critical distance is @xmath42 whenever they both apply .",
    "unfortunately , we were unable to extend this upper bound on @xmath1 to large values of @xmath0 : for example , when @xmath0 is constant as @xmath20 .",
    "of course , since a @xmath43-distance - uniform graph is also @xmath44-distance - uniform , theorem  [ thm : intro - lower ] provides a lower bound of @xmath45 for any @xmath46 .",
    "the family of graphs used to prove theorem  [ thm : intro - lower ] is interesting in its own right .",
    "we give two different interpretations of the underlying structure of these graphs .",
    "first , we describe a combinatorial game , generalizing the well - known tower of hanoi puzzle , whose transition graph is @xmath0-distance - uniform and has large diameter .",
    "second , we give a geometric interpretation , under which each graph in the family is the skeleton of the convex hull of an arrangement of points on a high - dimensional sphere .",
    "before proceeding to the proof of theorem  [ thm : intro - upper ] , we begin with a simple argument that is effective for an @xmath0 which is very small :    [ prop : min - degree ] the minimum degree @xmath47 of an @xmath0-distance - uniform graph @xmath32 satisfies @xmath48 .",

    "we identify the vertex @xmath218 of @xmath50 with the vertex @xmath224 of @xmath206 .",
    "since @xmath225 after any move in the hanoi game , this @xmath36-tuple really is a hanoi state .",
    "conversely , any hanoi state @xmath226 corresponds to a vertex of @xmath50 : let @xmath227 , and let @xmath221 be the state obtained from @xmath106 by either an adjustment of @xmath228 to @xmath229 , if @xmath230 , or else an involution , if @xmath231 . therefore the map we define is a bijection between the vertex sets .    both @xmath50 and @xmath206",
    "are @xmath207-regular graphs , therefore it suffices to show that each edge of @xmath50 corresponds so an edge in @xmath206 .",
    "consider an edge joining @xmath218 with @xmath220 in @xmath50 .",
    "this corresponds to vertices @xmath224 and @xmath232 in @xmath206 ; these are adjacent , since we can obtain one from the other by an adjustment .",
    "next , consider an edge joining @xmath218 to @xmath219 .",
    "if @xmath106 and @xmath221 are related by an adjustment in @xmath217 , then they have the form @xmath233 and @xmath234 .",
    "the vertices corresponding to @xmath218 and @xmath219 in @xmath206 are @xmath235 and @xmath236 , and one can be obtained from the other by an involution .",
    "finally , if @xmath106 and @xmath221 are related by an involution in @xmath217 , then that involution swaps @xmath119 and @xmath237 .",
    "therefore such an involution in @xmath206 will take @xmath238 to @xmath239 , and the vertices corresponding to @xmath218 and @xmath219 are adjacent in @xmath206 .",
