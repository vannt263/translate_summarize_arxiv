    "<S> we present a study of complexes of young massive star clusters ( ymcs ) , embedded in extragalactic giant hii regions , based on the coupling of spectroscopic with photometric and spectrophotometric observations of about 100 star forming regions in seven spiral galaxies ( ngc  628 , ngc  783 , ngc  2336 , ngc  6217 , ngc  6946 , ngc  7331 , and ngc  7678 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the complete observational database has been observed and accumulated within the framework of our comprehensive study of extragalactic star forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the current paper presents the last part of either unpublished or refreshed photometric and spectrophotometric observations of the galaxies ngc  6217 , ngc  6946 , ngc  7331 , and ngc  7678 . </S>",
    "<S> we derive extinctions , chemical abundances , continuum and line emissions of ionised gas , ages and masses for cluster complexes . </S>",
    "<S> we find the young massive cluster complexes to have ages no greater than @xmath0  myr and masses between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and the extinctions @xmath3 vary between @xmath4 and 3  mag , while the impact of the nebular emission on integrated broadband photometry mainly is not greater than @xmath5 of the total flux and is comparable with accuracies of dereddened photometric quantities . </S>",
    "<S> we also find evidence of differential extinction of stellar and gas emissions in some clusters , which hinders the photometric determination of ages and masses in these cases . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we show that young massive cluster complexes in the studied galaxies and open clusters in the milky way form a continuous sequence of luminosities / masses and colour / ages .    </S>",
