    "the spin - down observed in most pulsars corresponds to a significant rate of energy loss , which manifests itself primarily in the form of a magnetized wind of relativistic particles ( e.g. rees & gunn 1974 ) . under certain conditions",
    "the interaction between this wind and its surroundings is observable , in the form of a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) . at radio frequencies pwne fall into two basic classes , plerions and bow - shock nebulae : plerions ( e.g.  @xcite )",
    "are the filled - center components of supernova remnants ( snrs ) in which the pulsar wind is confined by the pressure of hot gas in the snr interior , while bow - shock nebulae are confined by the ram pressure associated with their pulsar s high velocity ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "both are characterized by significant levels of linear polarization , a centrally - peaked morphology and a flat spectral index ( @xmath4 ; @xmath5 ) .",
    "while only a tiny fraction of a pulsar s spin - down energy goes into producing the radio emission from such nebulae , radio pwne are valuable diagnostics of the properties of both the wind and of the pulsar itself ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "insight into the workings of such pwne is limited by the fact that only six pulsars , all with ages @xmath6  yr , have associated radio pwne ( @xcite , hereafter fs97 ) .",
    "attempts to detect radio nebulae around older pulsars have so far been unsuccessful ( e.g. @xcite ) .    in an attempt to increase the sample of radio pwne",
    ", fs97 used the very large array at 8.4  ghz to search for pwne around 35 pulsars of high spin - down luminosity and/or velocity , but found no new pwne down to a surface brightness @xmath7  k. they concluded that only young , energetic pulsars produce observable radio nebulae , and that the properties of a pulsar s wind may change as the pulsar ages .",
    "however , a weak , compact or steep - spectrum nebula is difficult to detect using the approach of fs97 , because the nebula is `` hidden '' by the emission from its associated pulsar .",
    "this has motivated us to attempt an alternative strategy for finding radio pwne , whereby visibilities are recorded at high time resolution so that off - pulse images can be produced .",
    "the full results of this program are described elsewhere ( @xcite ) ; here we report on the discovery of an unusual pwn associated with psr  b090649 .",
    "psr  b090649 ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) is a 107  ms pulsar ( @xcite ) whose characteristic age @xmath10  112000  yr and spin - down luminosity @xmath11  erg  s@xmath12 place it amongst the 5% youngest and most energetic of all pulsars .",
    "absorption has yielded distances to the pulsar in the ranges 2.46.7  kpc ( @xcite ) and 6.37.7  kpc ( @xcite ) , while a distance estimate using the pulsar s dispersion measure ( @xcite ) is @xmath13  kpc . in future discussion",
    "we assign it a distance @xmath14  kpc .",
    "the pulse profile shows a strong main pulse and weaker interpulse , both of which are @xmath090% linearly polarized ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "scintillation measurements imply a transverse velocity for the pulsar of @xmath050@xmath15  ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations of psr  b090649 were carried out with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , and are described in table  [ tab_observations ] . in each observation , two continuum frequencies were observed simultaneously with 32 4-mhz channels across each ; all four stokes parameters were recorded .",
    "all observations were carried out in pulsar gating mode , in which visibilities were sampled at a time resolution of 3.3  ms ( 32 bins per period ) and then folded at the apparent pulse period .",
    "these summed visibilities were then recorded every 40 seconds .",
    "the flux density scale of the observations was determined by observations of pks  b1934638 , while polarization and antenna gains were calibrated using observations every 45  min of pks  b0823500 .",
    "data were edited and calibrated using the miriad package , and then dedispersed at a dispersion measure of 179  pc  @xmath3 .",
    "the resultant smearing due to the finite channel width was in all cases no more than one time bin . at each frequency",
    "the field of interest was imaged , deconvolved using @xmath16 iterations of the clean algorithm , and then convolved with a gaussian beam of dimensions corresponding to the diffraction limit .",
    "in fig  [ fig_contours_1344](a ) we show a 1.3-ghz image of the region surrounding the pulsar , using all time bins from 1997 may and 1997 aug observations .",
    "an adjacent  region ( @xcite ) contributes considerable extended emission , which we discard by imaging using only @xmath17 spacings greater than 1  k@xmath18 .",
    "the pulsar is apparent as an unresolved source at position ra ( j2000 ) @xmath19 , dec ( j2000 ) @xmath20 , in agreement with its timing position ( @xcite ) .",
    "extracting the time dependence of the data at these coordinates from the visibilities gives the profile shown in fig  [ fig_profile ] , clearly showing the main pulse and interpulse .",
    "similar profiles are obtained at other frequencies : flux densities for the pulsar ( including any coincident unpulsed emission ) are given in table  [ tab_fluxes ] .",
    "an unrelated source , atca  j090850491301 , can be seen 25 to the east of the pulsar , with flux densities also listed in table  [ tab_fluxes ] .",
    "fig  [ fig_contours_1344](b ) shows the same field as in fig  [ fig_contours_1344](a ) , but generated by only using time bins in which there is no discernible pulsed emission .",
    "a weak source can now be seen at the position of the pulsar .",
    "while the pulsar s emission is well - fitted by a gaussian corresponding to a point source , a fit to this weaker source shows it to be extended , with dimensions @xmath21 at position angle 315@xmath2210  ( n through e ) .",
    "after correction for bandwidth depolarization , the source is less than @xmath050% polarized .",
    "the position of its peak agrees with that of psr  b090649 to 06 in ra and to 04 in dec .",
    "the flux density of the off - pulse source as a function of frequency is detailed in table  [ tab_fluxes ] . in observations at 1.7  ghz and 2.2  ghz the source was not detected , despite being simultaneously detected at each epoch at a lower frequency . for non - detections we quote upper limits to the flux density , derived using the method of green & scheuer ( 1992 ) .",
    "this involves adding to the data simulated sources of the same dimensions as the off - pulse source , increasing the flux density until the simulated source is distinguishable above the noise .",
    "the upper limits quoted in table  [ tab_fluxes ] are conservative , being twice the values at which a simulated source could be discerned .    a 1.3-ghz off - pulse image from 1997",
    "may 12 data , made using all baselines , is shown in fig  [ fig_trail ] . as well as atca  j090850491301 and the off - pulse source ,",
    "a faint trail of emission can be seen , extending @xmath0@xmath23 south - east from the pulsar s position , broadening with increasing distance from it before abruptly terminating .",
    "the apex of the trail coincides with the position of the pulsar , and the position angle defined by the bisection of the trail s two flanks is consistent with the direction along which the off - pulse source is extended .",
    "the flux density of the trail is @xmath07  mjy . in 1.3-ghz data from 1997 aug 17 observations ,",
    "the trail is just visible amidst confusing thermal emission .",
    "the trail was not detected in 1.2-ghz observations ( which were severely affected by interference ) , nor was it seen at 1.7 or 2.2  ghz ( as for the off - pulse source ) . while the inclusion of short baselines produces a great deal of confusing structure , no other feature resembling the trail is seen in any part of the field in any observation .",
    "an h@xmath24 observation of the region ( @xcite ) shows no emission which can be associated with any radio - emitting source , a result which can be attributed to a foreground dark cloud ( @xcite ) .",
    "we consider four possible explanations for the weak source coincident with psr  b090649 : positional coincidence with an unrelated source , a compact snr , emission from the pulsar itself , or a pulsar wind nebula associated with the pulsar .    at @xmath25  cm , extragalactic source counts ( e.g. windhorst et al .",
    "1985 ) imply a probabibility @xmath0@xmath26 of finding a background radio source of flux density @xmath271  mjy within 1  of the pulsar , allowing us to rule out a coincidental alignment .",
    "we estimate that positional coincidence with an unrelated galactic source is also unlikely .",
    "the source under consideration may be a compact snr , in the form of either a shell ( @xcite ) or a plerion ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , a shell or plerion of age @xmath28  yr and radius @xmath29  pc as required here results in an improbably high ( @xmath30  @xmath3 ) density for the surrounding medium .",
    "no other emission is seen in the region which might correspond to a more extended snr ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , and we presume it to have dissipated .    although we took care to create an image using only off - pulse bins , it is impossible to exclude the possibility that fig  [ fig_contours_1344](b ) still contains some flux from the pulsar , in the form of either unpulsed emission or a further weak component to the pulse profile .",
    "our main argument against such interpretations is that the off - pulse source appears extended .",
    "although the source is too weak to fit to in the @xmath17 plane , its extension and position angle are quite different from that of the synthesized beam , and are visible at all reasonable contour levels .",
    "it is difficult to see how the presence of noise , sidelobes or other artifacts could artificially create such an appearance .",
    "the extension is not directed towards the phase center and so can not be accounted for by bandwidth smearing . nor is there evidence for significant time variability in the pulsar s flux , which might also mimic an extended source ( and in any case would cause the pulsar itself to appear similarly extended ) .",
    "the source is evident in repeated observations , and persists when imaging various subsets of the off - pulse component of the pulse profile .",
    "the off - pulse source also lacks the high fractional linear polarization observed for the pulsar .",
    "we thus conclude that it is unlikely that the source represents emission from the pulsar itself .",
    "the remaining possibility is that this source represents synchrotron emission from a pulsar wind nebula associated with psr  b090649 .",
    "the observed elongation of the pwn suggests that it is a bow - shock nebula , an interpretation supported by the trail s morphology and its alignment with the pwn s major axis .",
    "we interpret the trail as a synchrotron wake extending behind the pulsar , whose inferred direction of motion is thus along pa 315 .",
    "this wake is analogous to similar radio structures seen trailing behind psrs b175724 ( @xcite ) and b1853 + 01 ( @xcite ) and behind the x - ray binary circinus x-1 ( @xcite ) .    by demanding that the pulsar has traversed the trail s length in its lifetime ( which we equate to @xmath31 in all further discussion ) , we determine a velocity @xmath32  , where @xmath33 is the inclination of the pulsar s direction of motion to the line of sight .",
    "the well - defined edge to the trail in the south - east suggests that the lack of emission beyond this point corresponds to a change in conditions rather than to synchrotron losses ( which are most likely negligible over the pulsar s lifetime in any case ) .",
    "given the agreement between the lower limit on @xmath34 and the scintillation velocity ( johnston et al .",
    "1998 ) , we propose that the pulsar was born at the base of the trail and adopt a velocity @xmath35  .",
    "the implied proper motion of @xmath36  mas  yr@xmath12 is too small to be measured directly , but could be constrained or ruled out through pulsar timing or vlbi .",
    "the pulsar wind flows freely from the pulsar until it encounters a reverse shock at radius  @xmath37 ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the location of this shock is unresolved in our data , and from our highest resolution data we estimate @xmath38  cm .",
    "we assume that all the pulsar s spin - down luminosity goes into the pulsar wind ; upper limits to its @xmath39-ray flux ( @xcite ) make this a reasonable assumption to within a factor of 2 .",
    "thus , equating the energy density of the pulsar wind , @xmath40 , with the ram pressure due to the pulsar s motion , @xmath41 , we find an ambient ( hydrogen ) density @xmath42  @xmath3 , significantly higher than for the general interstellar medium .",
    "a distance greater than 7  kpc is inconsistent with the pulsar s  absorption ; thus only if the pulsar s velocity is significantly greater than 60  can this discrepancy be reconciled .",
    "if we adopt the lower distance limit determined by koribalski  ( 1995 ) and adjust the pulsar velocity accordingly , the required density rises to @xmath43  @xmath3 .",
    "we note that the co survey of grabelsky  ( 1987 ) shows molecular material in the direction of psr  b090649 , at velocities corresponding to the range determined for the pulsar from  absorption .",
    "thus pwn  b090649 appears to be a bow - shock pwn in which the main contribution to the confining ram pressure appears to be the density of surrounding material rather than the pulsar s high velocity .",
    "while there are other instances of bow - shock pwne around low velocity pulsars ( see @xcite ) , psr  b090649 is the only case in which the pwn has been detected at radio frequencies .",
    "the spectral index of pwn  b090649 is poorly determined by the available data , but assuming a single power law over the observed range implies @xmath44 .",
    "this is significantly steeper than for filled - center snrs ( @xcite ) and for the six other known radio pwn ; we note that such a nebula would not have been detected by the 8.4  ghz search of fs97 . for @xmath45 ,",
    "the integrated radio luminosity of the pwn is @xmath46  erg  s@xmath12 , corresponding to an efficiency @xmath47 .",
    "these values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are significantly lower than for any other radio pwn ( see fs97 ) . of pulsars powering such nebulae , only psr  b1853 + 01 has a ( slightly ) lower @xmath50 .",
    "the unusual spectrum of pwn  b090649 may relate to a decrease in the efficiency of shock acceleration resulting from enhanced densities and reduced shock velocities ( @xcite ) .",
    "if a significant component of the radio emission is due to electrons accelerated at the shock front between the pulsar wind and its surroundings , the high density and low velocity we have proposed for this source might explain its steep spectrum and low luminosity .",
    "alternatively , fs97 have argued that older , less energetic pulsars do not produce observable radio nebulae , and a simple explanation for both their and our observations is that the intrinsic spectrum of injected electrons steepens with age .",
    "apart from psr  b1951 + 32 ( @xmath51  yr ) , b090649 is at least five times older than any other pulsar associated with a radio pwn .",
    "while psr  b1951 + 32 is only slightly younger than psr  b090649 , the former system represents a complicated interaction between the pulsar and its associated snr ( @xcite ) , and it is difficult to separate the contribution of the pulsar wind from that of the supernova shock .",
    "using pulsar - gating observations at @xmath25  cm , we have found an off - pulse , slightly extended source coincident with psr  b090649 , which we interpet as a faint pulsar wind nebula .",
    "an associated trail implies a projected velocity for the pulsar of @xmath060  along a position angle 315 .",
    "the system is unusual in several ways :    1 .",
    "the nebula has a lower luminosity and steeper spectrum than any other radio pwn yet discovered ; 2 .",
    "psr  b090649 is older than any other pulsar known to power a radio pwn , while only psr  b1853 + 01 has a lower spin - down luminosity ; 3 .",
    "the pwn appears to be generated by a slow ( @xmath060  ) pulsar moving through a dense ( @xmath2  @xmath3 ) medium .",
    "thus pwn  b090649 appears to be very different from other radio pwne . to account for this",
    ", we propose that either the low velocity and high density inhibits shock acceleration , or that the particle spectrum injected by a pulsar into its pwn steepens with age . in the latter case",
    ", pwn  b090649 may be in transition between the high luminosity , flat - spectrum pwne seen around young pulsars , and the undetectable radio pwne around older pulsars .",
    "we note that pwne of low flux density and steep spectrum were heavily selected against in fs97 s ungated , high frequency observations .",
    "we therefore recommend that future searches , particularly around intermediate - age pulsars , should be made as here : at low frequencies , and by imaging only the off - pulse emission .",
    "a collection of pwne produced under a variety of conditions still needs to be accumulated before we can fully understand how the radio emission from a pwn is produced and how it depends on the properties of its pulsar .",
