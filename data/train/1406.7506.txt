    "in 1907 , zenneck published a theoretical analysis of a radio - frequency surface wave guided by the planar interface of air and ground , both assumed homogeneous and isotropic @xcite .",
    "subsequently , an electromagnetic surface wave guided by the interface of two homogeneous and isotropic dielectric materials of which only one is dissipative came to be called the zenneck wave .",
    "a 1903 analysis of the same type of wave guided by the interface of a nondissipative dielectric material and ( dissipative ) seawater by uller @xcite appears to have become obscure , except for citations by both zenneck @xcite and collin  @xcite . since uller not only obtained but also solved the dispersion equation of the surface wave , albeit under the special conditions of seawater being significantly conductive and the ( real ) relative permittivity of seawater being much larger than that of its partnering material ( air ? ) , we think it is appropriate to name this surface wave after both uller and zenneck .",
    "sommerfeld  @xcite provided a rigorous mathematical analysis of the uller  zenneck wave ; see also a review by wait @xcite . as the ground is",
    "not metallic but is a dissipative dielectric material , the uller  zenneck wave must be distinguished from the surface plasmon - polariton ( spp ) wave that is usually taken to be guided by the interface of a lossless dielectric material and a metal , both assumed homogeneous and isotropic  @xcite .",
    "although sometimes ignored @xcite , the distinction between spp and uller  zenneck waves has a significant consequence . unlike an spp wave , whose phase speed is smaller than that of a plane wave in the partnering dielectric material , the phase speed of an uller  zenneck wave is usually larger than the phase speeds of plane waves in both partnering dielectric materials .",
    "accordingly , unlike the spp wave @xcite , the uller  zenneck wave can be excited without the use of a coupling prism or a surface - relief grating .",
    "all that is needed is to illuminate the guiding planar interface by a highly obliquely incident plane wave .",
    "but , that very same characteristic leads to difficulties in distinguishing the uller  zenneck wave from other waves in the radio - frequency regime @xcite .",
    "experimental observation of the uller  zenneck wave in the same spectral regime  @xcite remains mired in confusion  @xcite .",
    "part of the reason for confusion about the uller  zenneck wave is an infelicitous connection with the brewster phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "theory , on the other hand , is unequivocal .",
    "uller @xcite , zenneck @xcite , and sommerfeld @xcite had investigated the canonical boundary - value problem depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ schematics](a ) . in this figure , the nondissipative dielectric partnering material with relative permittivity @xmath0 ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) occupies the half space @xmath3 ; the dissipative dielectric partnering material with relative permittivity @xmath4 ( @xmath5 , @xmath6 ) occupies the half space @xmath7 ; and the uller  zenneck wave propagates parallel to the @xmath8 axis , decays as @xmath9 , and does not depend on @xmath10 .",
    "the wave has to be @xmath11 polarized ( i.e. , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , where the cartesian unit vectors are identified as @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 ) .",
    "the dispersion equation is readily solvable  @xcite .",
    "however , the canonical boundary - value problem is not implementable practically . at the very least",
    ", the dissipative partnering material has to have a large but finite thickness @xmath17 , as shown schematically in fig .",

    "air has been taken as the nondissipative partnering material in most radio - frequency experiments @xcite .",
    "but the evidence for the excitation of the uller  zenneck wave in this configuration is ambiguous @xcite .",
    "the grating - coupled configuration @xcite provides an alternative . as shown in fig .",
    "[ schematics](c ) , the interface of the two partnering materials is periodically corrugated in this configuration .",
    "although some evidence is available from a finite - element simulation @xcite in the radio - frequency regime , with the periodic corrugations modeled as an impedance plane with periodically varying surface impedance , no comparison was made in that study against the underlying canonical boundary - value problem and the localization of the surface wave was not explicitly demonstrated .",
    "since the grating - coupled configuration is practicable in the optical regime @xcite , we decided to examine theoretically if unambiguous experimental evidence of the uller  zenneck wave can be obtained therefrom .",
    "therefore , the grating - coupled configuration is the focus of this paper , although the underlying canonical boundary - value problem and excitation using the planar interface were also investigated .",
