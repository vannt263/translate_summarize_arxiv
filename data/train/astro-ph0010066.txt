    "2000 , paper i ) we have strengthened these previous results and provided additional evidences that the dust in the circumnuclear region of agns is characterized by anomalous properties . by comparing the reddening toward the broad line region ( blr ) and the gaseous n@xmath2 inferred from the x - rays in a sample of 20 agns we found that , with the exception of three low luminosity agns , the @xmath0 ratio is lower than the galactic standard value by a factor ranging from @xmath33 to @xmath3100 . by comparing the optical and x - ray properties of various agn classes (",
    "type 1.81.9 sys , hard x - ray selected and radio selected qsos , broad absorption line qsos and grism - selected qsos ) it was inferred that the @xmath1 ratio must be one or two orders of magnitude lower than galactic . despite the large mid - ir continuum absorption inferred from the pahs equivalent width ,",
    "the absence of a significant silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath4 m in the average iso spectrum of sy2s indicates that dust grains in the circumnuclear region of agns have different properties with respect to the galactic diffuse interstellar medium .",
    "finally , the lack of the 2175  carbon dip in the uv spectra of some type 1 agns , which appear affected by dust reddening , suggests a depletion of small grains in the absorbing medium , as mentioned in paper i. these findings suggest that the dust grain distribution is biased in favor of large grains .",
    "the presence of large grains in the circumnuclear region of agns was also suggested by laor & draine ( 1993 ) to explain some of the infrared properties of agns .    in this paper",
    "we examine some possible explanations of the observational findings presented in paper i. in particular , we compare our models with the quantitative constraints given on the @xmath0 ratio , the equivalent width of the silicate feature and the depth of the 2175  carbon dip .",
    "note that we often distinguish the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratios since , when discussing extinction curves different from galactic , reddening and absorption are no longer tied by the standard galactic relation @xmath5 .",
    "in other words , models which could account for a decreasing of @xmath0 do not necessarily lower the @xmath1 ratio , and vice versa .    in section 2 we first analyze and , in practice , dismiss scenarios with a standard ( galactic ) grain size distribution . the case for large grains",
    "is analyzed and discussed in sect .",
    "3 while in sect .",
    "4 we draw our conclusions .",
    "various studies have found evidence for super - solar metallicities in the nuclear region of agns ( ferland et al .",

    "the gaseous column densities used in paper i were inferred from the photoelectric cutoff observed in the x - rays , but actually such a cutoff gives a measure of the column of metals n@xmath6 ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) , which is then converted into hydrogen column n@xmath2 by assuming solar abundances . if the metallicity is higher than solar , then the n@xmath2 inferred from the x - rays would be overestimated . on the other hand ,",
    "a large fraction of refractory elements is locked into grains . as a consequence ,",
    "an increased metallicity would also imply a higher dust content .",
    "both the dust content and the n@xmath6 to n@xmath2 conversion factor depend linearly on the metallicity and , therefore , any change in metallicity should not affect the @xmath0 ratio in the way we measure it .",
    "finally , we should emphasize that there are no obvious astrophysical nucleosynthesis processes that favor the formation of non - refractory elements over refractory ones , implying that even `` peculiar '' metallicities ( in terms of relative abundances between metals ) should not affect the observed @xmath0 ratio .",
    "also , metallicity effects can not explain the discrepancy between the lack of silicate feature and the strong mid - ir absorption in sy2s . in the small magellanic cloud the lack of the 2175  carbon dip",
    "is ascribed to a low metallicity , but this is unlikely to be the explanation for agns since , as discussed above , generally the latter are characterized by super - solar metallicities .",
    "although metallicity effects can not explain the anomalous properties of dust in agns , it can have important consequences on the expected emission line fluxes in the case of ionized gas containing dust .",

    ", we would expect that the broad lines observed in our objects , once corrected for the observed reddening , are underluminous by a factor of @xmath3100 with respect to the intrinsic luminosity indicated by the absorption - corrected x - ray luminosity , when compared to unobscured type  1 seyferts and qsos .",

    "clearly none of the objects is underluminous in broad @xmath14 by the factor of @xmath15 expected in the case of reflection .",
    "the most `` @xmath14deficient '' object is ngc2992 .",
    "this object does show significant polarization ( tab .  1 ) , but as discussed above this is very likely a dichroic effect due to transmission through the host galaxy , which is seen edge - on ; an interpretation which is also supported by the finding that the [ oiii ] line is polarized at the same level as the continuum and broad h@xmath9 line ( goodrich 1992 ) . as we shall discuss in sect .  3",
    ", the most likely interpretation for the @xmath14 deficiency in this object is a peculiar extinction curve .",
    "it should also be noted that mkn231 is actually significantly overluminous in @xmath14 , by a factor of @xmath330 . this object is actually known to be underluminous in the x - rays .",
    "possibly , the absorbing column density might be much higher than that estimated by iwasawa ( 1999 ) and turner ( 1999 ) in their faint hard x - ray spectrum . in the latter case",
    "the intrinsic x - ray luminosity could be much higher .",
    "we should however mention that the sample presented in paper i ( tab .",
    "1 ) is probably biased in favor of objects which are particularly bright in the broad lines emission , just as a consequence of the selection criterion ( i.e. those absorbed objects which show at least some broad emission lines ) . nonetheless , it is highly unlikely that such a selection effect accounts for a factor of @xmath3100 in the h@xmath9 flux .",
    "it is worth noting that a diagram analogous to fig .",
    "1 was presented by veilleux et al .",
    "( 1999 , therein fig .",
    "3 ) when discussing the detection of broad pa@xmath9 in ultraluminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) ; there the broad h@xmath9 is replaced by the broad pa@xmath9 and the ( intrisic ) x - ray luminosity is replaced by the far - ir luminosity . from that diagram",
    "it can be similarly inferred that the broad component of the pa@xmath9 detected in ulirgs can not be ascribed to reflection . for what concern seyfert galaxies , veilleux et al .",
    "( 1997 ) reach a similar conclusion stating that the broad component of the hydrogen near - ir lines detected in some sy2s can not be ascribed to reflection .    finally , also in the reflection scenario the lack of silicate absorption in sy2s and of the lack of the carbon dip in reddened sy1s is not explained .",
    "unlike the case of galactic stars where both absorption and scattering contribute to the extinction , in obscured agns we may have effects of scattering back into our beam .",
    "this would imply a reduction of the scattering component in the effective extinction curve .",
    "however , the net effect must be small compared to what observed for the objects of our sample . even in the most extreme case that the absorbing / scattering medium covers the whole solid angle seeing by the nuclear source ( that is very unlikely ) and that the scattered radiation enters our beam without undergoing any dust absorption ( that is also very unlikely ) ,",
    "then the effect would be to completely remove the scattering component out of the total exinction curve . since at the wavelengths of interest @xmath16 , the effect of this extreme case would be to reduce the extinction and reddening by a factor of 3 at most . while in our sample we observe several cases for which the reddening deficit is much higher .",
    "the analysis above makes the implicit assumption that the line of sight is `` typical '' , but it is possible that the absorbing column along the line of sight is lower than the scattering column along the other directions . in the latter case , and under the extreme assumption discussed above , the effective extinction could be reduced further . yet",
    ", this effect of scattering back into the beam would not explain the lack of absorption features in the uv and in the mid - ir .",
    "several reverberation mapping studies have shown that the blr has a size of @xmath30.01 pc .",
    "more specifically @xmath17 pc ( clavel et al . 1991 , peterson 1993 , salamanca et al .",
    "on the other hand , various pieces of evidence indicate that the obscuring torus has a size of @xmath31 pc or larger ( gallimore et al .",
    "1997 , greenhill & gwinn 1997 , ford et al .",
    "1997 , granato et al .",
    "1997 , maiolino 2000 , and references therein ) .",
    "since the scale of the latter is so much larger than both the x - ray source and the blr , the absorbing medium along the line of sight should be the same for both .",
    "however , for many of the objects in the sample presented in paper i ( tab .",
    "1 ) the broad lines have a width of about 2000 km / s , which is somewhat narrower than usually observed in type 1 seyferts and qsos .",
    "this might imply that in these objects the blr , or the fraction of it that we observe , is more extended than assumed and with dimensions comparable to the obscuring torus . as a consequence",
    ", the blr might be observed , on average , through a lower absorbing column with respect to the nuclear x - ray source .",
    "however , since the broad lines in many of these objects are weak , very broad wings might have been undetected because either lost in the noise or confused with the underlying continuum features , thus yielding to an underestimate of the real width of these lines .",
    "also , in some of these objects the broad lines were observed to vary on time scales shorter than a few months , suggesting a blr scale smaller than 0.1 pc ( eracleous & halpern 1993 , winkler et al .",
    "1992 , rosenblatt et al .",
    "1994 , giannuzzo & stirpe 1996 , peterson et al . 1984 , 1982 , miller et al .",
    "1985 , 1979 ) . summarizing",
    ", we can not exclude that for some of the objects in our sample the blr is extended enough that the broad lines and the ( much smaller ) hard x - ray source are obscured by columns of gas that are significantly different .",
    "however , this is unlikely to be the case for most of the objects .",
    "finally , the lack of the silicate feature in the mid - ir spectra of sy2s and the lack of the carbon dip in the uv spectra of reddened sy1s remain unexplained by the differential absorption scenario discussed in this section .",
    "if one or more blr clouds are located along the line of sight toward the x - ray nuclear source then they would contribute to the observed gaseous absorbing column density ( blr clouds are expected to have @xmath18 ) , but obviously this absorbing column would not affect the observed broad line flux .",
    "however , should the low @xmath0 be a feature common to most agns and should the cause of this effect be absorption by blr clouds , then this would require a large covering factor of the blr clouds , at least as high as the covering factor of the obscuring medium , i.e. @xmath380% . on the other hand the covering factor of the blr clouds is estimated to be low ( @xmath310% ) based on the absence of any ly - edge cutoff in the uv spectrum of qsos .",
    "therefore , absorption due blr clouds might explain some of the cases of low @xmath0 , but probably not the majority of them .",
    "another reason to discard this explanation is related to the lack of strong and short term variability of the absorbing n@xmath2 in the x - rays .",
    "if most of the photoelectric cutoff observed in the hard x - rays is due to a single or a few blr clouds along the line of sight , then a strong variation of the @xmath19 would be expected on a time scale of a few weeks or less , given the expected size of the blr clouds ( @xmath20 pc ) and their velocity . however , about 1/3 of the objects in our sample were observed two or more times in the hard x - rays ( eg .",
    "gilli et al .",
    "2000 , malizia et al .",
    "1997 ) and the @xmath19 inferred from the cutoff does not show the strong variations expected from the motion of a blr cloud passing on the line of sight .",
    "there are a few objects ( most of them not in our sample ) whose hard x - ray monitoring has indeed shown variations of @xmath21 , but such variations are on time scales of years , i.e. consistent with a distance of the absorber from the nucleus of a few pc ( maiolino 2000 ) .",
    "the only case known to show rapid n@xmath2 variability is ngc4151 .",
    "again , the issues related to the silicate feature and to the carbon dip remain unexplained also in this case .",
    "the inner part of the obscuring torus is directly exposed to the uv radiation emitted by the nuclear source . if the uv flux at this location is large enough , the dust equilibrium temperature can reach the sublimation value ( laor & draine 1993 , phinney 1989 ) .",
    "if dust is sublimated for a significant fraction of the absorbing gaseous column this would explain the reduced @xmath10 with respect to that expected from the observed n@xmath2 .",
    "however , this model has problems when compared with the low covering factor inferred for the ionized gas in the circumnuclear region of agns , as discussed in the following .",
    "the capability of the dust in competing with the gas in the absorption of uv ionizing photons increases significantly with the ionization parameter u. indeed , a highly ionized gas is much more transparent than dust to the uv ionizing photons . in particular , for a galactic gas - to - dust ratio and dust composition , dust grains are expected to dominate the absorption of photons beyond the lyman edge when u is higher than about 10@xmath22 . at the inner face of the torus",
    "the ionization parameter is expected to be about 0.1 or larger ( netzer & laor 1993 , netzer 2000 ) and therefore most of the uv ionizing photons should be absorbed by the dust which reprocesses this radiation into near and mid - ir emission , which is actually observed in the nuclear region of agns ( eg .",
    "maiolino et al .",
    "1995 , clavel et al .",
    "2000 , maiolino et al .",
    "1998 , thatte et al .",
    "1997 , oliva et al .",
    "1999 ) . as a consequence , although the obscuring torus probably subtends as much as 80% of the solid angle seen by the nuclear uv source , very little line emission is produced .",
    "the emission lines that would be produced by the torus in absence of dust should have a width significantly smaller than the broad lines and close to the width of the narrow lines .",
    "the effect of strong absorption of uv ionizing photons from dust at the inner face of the torus has been proposed to explain the marked separation between blr and nlr and to explain the low covering factor of the nlr . a more detailed discussion of this issue is given in netzer & laor ( 1993 ) , in laor & draine ( 1993 ) and pier & voit ( 1995 ) .",
    "here we do not discuss further the implications of dust absorption for the photoionization models of the circumnuclear gas , but we use these considerations as a constraint for the properties of the dust at the inner face of the torus .",
    "if most of the gas in the torus is dust - free , especially at the inner face , because of dust sublimation , then photons at wavelengths shortward of the ly edge should ionize the gas in the torus and should produce powerful hydrogen lines nearly as narrow as the narrow lines .",
    "the covering factor of the torus is estimated to be @xmath380% . until a few years ago the covering factor of the nlr",
    "was estimated to be @xmath32% ( eg .",
    "netzer & laor 1993 ) ; however recent observations of the uv spectrum of qsos indicate a shortage of ionizing photons with respect to former estimates by a factor of about 4 ( zheng et al . 1997 , laor et al .",
    "1997 ) therefore implying a larger covering factor of the nlr ( @xmath38% ) , but which is still much lower than the covering factor estimated for the obscuring torus . as a consequence",
    ", the flux of the emission lines produced by the dust - sublimated torus should be about 10 times larger than the observed narrow lines .",
    "a possible way to suppress the line emission in the dust sublimated medium is to make the ionized gas very hot .",
    "however , in the latter case the absorbing medium observed in the hard x - rays should appear `` warm '' ( according to the x - ray standards ) . on the other hand , in",
    "most of the objects of the sample presented in paper i the absorbing gas is `` cold '' beyond doubt .    summarizing ,",
    "it is difficult to ascribe the low @xmath0 ratio to dust sublimation at the inner face of the torus without running into a serious emission line budget problem .    for what concerns the absorption features",
    ", dust sublimation might explain the lack of the carbon dip at 2175  in reddened sy1s , since the very small grains which are responsible for this feature undergo sublimation more easily than larger grains .",
    "however , it is difficult to ascribe the lack of the silicate feature in the spectra of sy2s to sublimation , indeed the absence of this absorption feature requires a dust distribution dominated by grains larger than a few @xmath4 m ( i.e. significantly larger than the maximum dimension of 0.25@xmath4 m inferred for the galactic medium ) , rather than the destruction of small grains ( sect.3.3 ) .",
    "one of the simplest ways to explain the observed low @xmath0 is to assume that the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the obscuring medium is lower than the standard galactic value .",
    "however , a reduced abundance of dust in the dense medium of the circumnuclear clouds is not obvious to justify .",
    "the vicinity of the agn could help to create the conditions that act to destroy dust grains .",
    "in particular , sputtering by x  rays and/or shocks might be a possible mechanisms of dust destruction in this environment .",
    "obviously , the @xmath0 ratio decreases linearly with the dust - to - gas ratio , if the dust properties remain unchanged .",
    "this is shown in the top panel of fig .  2 .",
    "the trend of @xmath0 as a function of the dust - to - gas ratio relative to the galactic value is given by the thick solid line .",
    "the horizontal thin line and shaded region show the mean and @xmath13 dispersion of @xmath0 for the objects in the sample presented in paper i. a factor of about 10 lower dust - to - gas ratio is required to match the mean of the observed @xmath0 values .",
    "the thin dashed vertical lines indicate the range of gas - to - dust ratios that matches the observed @xmath0 for @xmath368% of the objects ( @xmath23 ) , which implies a dust - to - gas ratio between @xmath24 times and 50 times lower than galactic .",
    "a dust underabundance of factor of @xmath3100 is required to explain the lowest @xmath0 found in paper i ( see fig .  1 in that paper ) .",
    "the central panel shows the trend for @xmath1 , which also decreases linearly since the absorption curve was assumed constant .    as the dust content decreases",
    ", the absorption of uv ionizing photons by dust grains becomes gradually less important and , as discussed in the previous section , the emission of nebular lines gradually increases . in order to check whether the required dust depletion runs into the same emission line budget problem as in the case of the sublimated dust ( sect.2.5 )",
    ", we have created a simple semi  analytical code to calculate the ionization structure and hydrogen lines emissivity of a gaseous cloud containing a variable amount of dust .",
    "we assumed a ionization parameter u=0.1 at the inner face of the cloud , as this is about the value expected at the inner face of the torus ( netzer & laor 1993 ) .",
    "the covering factor was assumed to be 80% .",
    "the results of the model were then compared with the expected emission line flux in the case of a dust - free medium with a covering factor equal to unity , i.e. the maximum hydrogen line flux ( h@xmath25(max ) ) which can be obtained with the available photoionizing luminosity .",
    "the ratio between the hydrogen line flux in the dusty and in the dust - free cases gives the importance of the line emission from the obscuring torus relative to other gaseous clouds which are either free from dust , such as the blr clouds , or whose ionization parameter is low enough to make unimportant the effect of dust absorption of uv ionizing photons , such as the nlr clouds .",
    "the thick black solid line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "2 shows the ratio between the h@xmath25 flux in the case of a dusty medium ( 80% covering factor ) and the case of a dust - free medium ( 100% covering factor ) , h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) , as a function of the dust - to - gas ratio in the obscuring torus .",
    "we also performed the same calculation with cloudy , the photoionization code provided by ferland and collaborators ( ferland 1999 ) , which accounts for several effects which are not included in our simple code .",
    "the output of cloudy is overplotted with a thin solid line in the bottom panel of fig .  2 .",
    "cloudy s result is not much different from ours and , partly , it is also to ascribe to the extinction curve used by cloudy which is somewhat different from the galactic standard curve ( eg .",
    "@xmath26 , to be compared with the standard galactic value of @xmath27 ) .",
    "this comparison justifies us in using our code also for other models in the next section ( sect.3 ) .",
    "the advantage of our code is that is it possible to use an arbitrary dust composition with a ( quasi- ) continuous distribution of grain sizes .",
    "the h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) values obtained with the model discussed above have to be compared with the flux of the narrow lines .",
    "more specifically , the flux of the lines emitted by the torus should be lower than the flux of the narrow lines not to incur in the emission line budget problems discussed in sect.2.5 ; this implies that h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) must be lower than the covering factor of the nlr clouds , i.e. @xmath110.08 ( sect.2.5 ) .",
    "this limit is shown with an horizontal line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "the dust - to - gas ratio required to match the mean observed @xmath0 would give h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max)@xmath280.15 that is inconsistent with the nlr covering factor .",
    "although , higher values of @xmath0 might be marginally consistent with the nlr emission , the values of @xmath0 lower than the mean would imply an even higher h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) , as shown in fig.2 .    in sect .",
    "2.1 we mentioned that the nuclear region of agns is generally characterized by super - solar metallicities .",
    "as we are going to discuss , a high metallicity helps to relax the constraints on the emission line flux .",
    "metallicity variations change the dust - to - gas ratio , but the variation of the dust - to - gas ratio due to metallicity leaves unaffected the _ measured _ @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "as discussed in sect.2.1 , this is because the @xmath21 is measured in the hard x - rays through the column of metals . on the other hand , the increased dust - to - gas ratio , regardless of whether due to metallicity or to other effects , does affect the dust - to - gas _ opacity _ for the uv ionizing photons and , therefore , changes the h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) accordingly . as a consequence ,",
    "even if metallicity does not affect the @xmath0 ratio , it can `` decouple '' the latter ratio from the emission line budget constraints .",
    "in particular , the dotted lines in fig .",
    "2 show the effect of a metallicity three times higher than solar . on the top and central panel of fig .  2 the ( metallicity )",
    "increased dust - to - gas ratio leaves unaffected the quantities on the y - axis , thus yielding a shift on the x - axis . instead , in the bottom panel the h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) ratio does change accordingly to the reduced dust - to - gas ratio , i.e. this ratio keep following the trend given by the solid line . as a result , for the same @xmath0 ratio the implied h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) is significantly lower . in particular , at the dust - to - gas ratio which gives an @xmath0 accounting for the mean observed value , h@xmath25(torus)/h@xmath25(max ) @xmath28 0.07 , which is marginally consistent with the covering factor of the nlr .",
    "yet , for lower values of @xmath0 the line emission from the torus is still much larger than the nlr .    summarizing , a low gas - to - dust ( mass ) density ratio might probably explain the reduced @xmath0 for several of the objects without incurring in emission line budget problems , especially if the metallicity is super - solar as claimed by several authors .",
    "however , low values of @xmath0 ( lower than the mean ) are still difficult to explain with this model .",
    "certainly , the reduced dust  to  gas ratio alone can not account for the lack of the silicate feature in the mid - ir spectra of sy2 , nor for the lack of the carbon dip in reddened sy1s .",
    "so far we have adopted the standard extinction curve observed in the diffuse galactic interstellar medium . however , the physical conditions of the gas in the nuclear region of seyferts and qsos are so extreme that there is no reason to assume that dust has the same properties as in the diffuse interstellar medium of our galaxy .",
    "the gas densities of the obscuring medium in agns probably exceeds 10@xmath2910@xmath30 @xmath31 , in a region smaller than a few pc , to avoid a gas mass higher than the dynamical mass ( risaliti et al .",
    "the presence of clouds with densities of 10@xmath32 cm@xmath22 in the circumnuclear region of agns is also directly inferred from hcn and other millimetric observations of agns with arcsecond resolution ( eg .",
    "tacconi et al .",
    "i.e. a density similar or higher than observed in the densest dark clouds of our galaxy .",
    "along the line of sight of dense galactic molecular clouds the extinction curve is generally found to be flatter than in the diffuse ism ( vrba & rydgren 1984 , carrasco et al .",
    "1973 , whittet et al . 1976 ,",
    "cardelli et al . 1989 ) .",
    "various observational evidences indicate that most likely such flat extinction curves are due to a distribution of grain sizes on average larger than in the diffuse ism ( kim et al .",
    "1994 , weingartner & draine 2000 ) .",
    "larger grains may form either by accretion from the gas phase or by grain coagulation .",
    "the former case should increase the @xmath1 ratio , while the latter case should generally yield a reduced @xmath1 .",
    "although measurements of @xmath1 are very uncertain , some works suggest that @xmath1 is lower in dense clouds characterized by flatter extinction curves , therefore supporting the coagulation scenario ( jura 1980 , kim & martin 1996 ) .",
    "also , theoretical considerations indicate that coagulation is much more effective for the growth of dust grains than accretion from the gas phase ( draine 2000 ) .",
    "since the grain coagulation rate increases with density ( @xmath34 , draine 1985 ) , the effect is expected to be even more dramatic in the circumnuclear clouds of agns . in particular , for a gas density in excess of 10@xmath30 cm@xmath22 the estimated time scale for the depletion of small grains due to coagulation is shorter than about 10@xmath29 yr , i.e. shorter than the typical dynamical time scale in the circumnuclear region of agns .",
    "this not only implies that dust grains have time to coagulate before being replaced by gas coming from the outer regions , but actually some mechanism that prevents grains to grow without limits must be invoked ( eg . shocks ) .",
    "a dust distribution biased in favor of large grains , probably as a consequence of coagulation , is naturally expected in the extreme physical conditions of the gas in the circumnuclear region of agns .",
    "the presence of large grains in the obscuring medium of agns was also proposed by laor & draine ( 1993 ) in relation to the ir properties of active nuclei . in the following",
    "we discuss the effects of large grains , specifically formed by coagulation , on the observational quantities discussed in paper i.      to obtain a more quantitative description of the effects of large grains in the circumnuclear region of agns we modelled the size grain distribution with a power - law : @xmath35 where a is the grain diameter ( assumed spherical ) and dn(a ) the density of grains with size between a and a+da . absorption and scattering cross sections",
    "were calculated by using the refractive indices in draine & lee ( 1984 ) and in laor & draine ( 1994 ) , and by numerically solving the mie formulas .",
    "the extinction curve in the galactic diffuse ism was successfully described by mathis et al .",
    "( 1977 ) with a mixture of graphite ( 47% ) and silicate ( 53% ) grains and with @xmath36 , @xmath37 and q=3.5 .",
    "the effect of large grains was investigated by us in various ways : either by increasing @xmath38 , or @xmath39 , or by decreasing q , or by a combination of these possibilities .",
    "coagulation was assumed by imposing the total dust mass to be constant ( relative to the gas mass ) .",
    "the increased average grain size always gives a flatter extinction curve .",
    "as long as @xmath38 is larger than 0.5@xmath4 m , coagulation also yields to @xmath0 and @xmath1 lower than the galactic standard value .",
    "we can not discuss here all of the possible cases which give flatter extinction curves . in the following we discuss three representative families of models ,",
    "all of which assume the same @xmath36 , but different @xmath38 and q.      fig .",
    "3 is analogous to fig .  2 , but in this case the dust - to - gas ( mass ) ratio is kept constant , while @xmath38 increases along the abscissa and the other two dust parameters are kept constant at q@xmath403.5 and @xmath41 .",
    "in addition to the panels shown in fig .  2 , we also include in fig .",
    "3 a panel giving the variation of @xmath42 ( the larger is r@xmath43 the flatter is the extinction curve ) . in this case",
    "r@xmath43 increases up to @xmath37 for very large @xmath44 .",
    "such large values of r@xmath43 imply that the absorption in the optical is higher than that estimated from the reddening assuming a galactic extinction curve .",
    "the h@xmath9 luminosities for the objects shown in fig .",
    "1 were corrected assuming r@xmath43=3.1 .",
    "if r@xmath43 is higher than galactic , then the h@xmath9 luminosities have been underestimated by the following quantity :    @xmath45    where @xmath46 depending on the details of the extinction curve . for an average @xmath47",
    "the correction is significant , i.e. @xmath48 in log @xmath49 .",
    "some of the objects in fig .  1",
    "do appear to be that or even more underluminous in @xmath14 with respect to the sy1+qso relation , thus supporting the large grains scenario .",
    "however , other objects are not underluminous in @xmath14 .",
    "for some of them the required @xmath50 correction is small and therefore still consistent with the sy1+qso distribution , but for others the corrected h@xmath9 luminosity becomes uncomfortably high ( @xmath51 above the sy1+qso distribution ) .",
    "however , as discussed in sect.2.2 our sample is probably biased in favor of h@xmath52 bright sources and , therefore , the excess of h@xmath9 luminosity discussed above does not necessary rule out the large grains hypothesis for these objects .",
    "the second panel of fig .",
    "3 shows the expected trend for @xmath0 ( thick solid line ) .",
    "this ratio has a steep decline as a function of @xmath38 .",
    "it should be noted that the locus of the values observed in agns ( shaded area ) is no longer constant as in fig .  2 ,",
    "this is because we also took into account that the reddening estimate @xmath10 based on the broad line ratios ( paper i ) changes with the extinction curve .",
    "the mean @xmath0 of the agns in our sample can be explained with @xmath53",
    ". a much larger value of @xmath38 ( @xmath54 ) is required to match the properties of objects with lower @xmath0 .",
    "the ratio @xmath1 also decreases rapidly with @xmath38 , indicating that large grains can , more generally , explain the low @xmath1 inferred for many agns and discussed in paper i.    the emission line budget problem does not improve much with respect to the case of low dust - to - gas ratio discussed in sect.2.6 : for solar metallicities , the @xmath55 ratio ranges from @xmath30.04 up to @xmath56 for the values of @xmath38 required to match the observed @xmath0 .    in the case of super - solar metallicities the dust - to - gas ratio increases , but both the extinction curve , and the @xmath0 and @xmath1 ratios remain unchanged , as discussed in sect.2.6 .",
    "however , the @xmath55 ratio decreases as a consequence of the increased dust absorption of uv ionizing photons ( see discussion in sect .",
    "the case of an increased dust - to - gas ratio due to a metallicity three times higher than solar is shown with a dotted line in the bottom panel of fig .",
    "3 . in this case",
    "the constraints given by the narrow line flux are met better and , in particular , for a@xmath57 lower than about 100 @xmath4 m , the expected @xmath55 is lower than the nlr constraints . yet ,",
    "very low values of @xmath0 ( observed for some of the objects analyzed in paper i ) remain difficult to explain with this model .      in fig .",
    "4 we show another `` family '' of grain distribution models : here @xmath38 is kept constant and equal to 1@xmath59 m , while q decreases along the abscissa .",
    "the extinction curve flattens very rapidly with q , as also indicated by the rapid growth of @xmath60 .",
    "as shown , in the second panel , such flat extinction curve would explain the objects with nearly no reddening @xmath10 , although substantial gaseous column @xmath21 is observed along the line ( paper i ) .",
    "however , several of the objects considered in paper i do show some reddening , therefore indicating that in these objects the extinction curve can not be completely flat .",
    "a possibility , is that in the outer parts of the obscuring torus , where the gas density is probably much lower , the properties of dust are more similar to those of the diffuse galactic ism . in this case",
    "the extinction , curve should be nearly identical to galactic , but shifted to higher values of absorption as a consequence of the higher density part of the torus which contributes with a flat extinction curve .",
    "the presence of `` normal '' dust in the outer parts obviously reduces @xmath60 , but also increases @xmath0 . the case in which 15% of the gaseous absorbing column @xmath21 contains `` normal '' dust",
    "is shown with a thick dashed line in fig .",
    "4 . in this case",
    "@xmath60 is not unreasonably high , and the @xmath61 inferred from the observed reddening is still consistent with the presence of weak broad lines in the optical or ir spectra of the agns examined in paper i. yet , the large value of @xmath60 makes the @xmath62 luminosity correction even higher than in sect.3.2.1 , which complies with the h@xmath9-weak objects , but might be a problem for those objects which are above the distribution of sy1+qso in fig .  1 ( see analogous discussion in sect.3.2.1 ) .",
    "another problem with the inclusion of an even small ( 15% ) fraction of dust with galactic extinction curve is that the ratio @xmath0 has a much slower decline and , as shown in fig .  4 , cases of very low @xmath0 are difficult to explain .",
    "another important effect of this `` family '' of models is that , at variance with the @xmath0 ratio , the @xmath1 ratio is not reduced by a large factor , as shown in fig .",
    "4 . therefore",
    ", this class of models does not provide the most likely explanation for objects characterized by very low @xmath1 values ( paper i ) .    yet ,",
    "one of the most appealing properties of this family of models is that the @xmath55 ratio is low ( @xmath38% at most ) and may be much lower than the nlr constrain , especially if the dust - to - gas ratio is increased as a consequence of super - solar metallicity ( bottom panel of fig .  4 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath55 is obviously unaffected by a fraction of the column density containing `` normal '' galactic dust , if the latter is located in the outer parts of the torus .      this family of models is shown in fig .  5 .",
    "these are similar to those discussed in laor & draine ( 1993 ) . here",
    "we do not discuss in detail the properties of these models , but mostly focus on the main differences and similarities with the former case .    in these models",
    "the effect of decreasing q not only rapidly flattens the extinction curve , but also decreases significantly the absorption @xmath61 , and therefore can easily explain little reddened objects with low @xmath1 ( paper i ) .",
    "if the metallicity is three times solar , or higher , the range of q required to match the @xmath0 distribution of most objects ( q@xmath643.1 ) also complies with the nlr constraint on the torus emission line flux ( bottom panel of fig .",
    "5 ) .    as a consequence of the much reduced absorption @xmath61 ,",
    "the inclusion of an outer layer of galactic dust reduces much more @xmath60 and affect much less @xmath0 .",
    "this is shown by the thick dashed line in fig .  5 , which gives the case with only 3% of the ( outer ) column of gas containing galactic `` standard '' dust .",
    "therefore , this family of models relaxes the problems on the large @xmath60 discussed in the family of models discussed in sect.3.2.2 : it gives very low @xmath0 and _ also _ @xmath1 values without incurring in large values of @xmath60 .",
    "we can not describe here all of the dust models that matches the specific constraints for each single object .",
    "however , for most of the agns discussed in paper i one or more dust distribution models match the specific constraints on @xmath0 , @xmath10 , broad lines luminosity and detection .      as mentioned in the introduction and discussed more in detail in paper i , sy2s appear characterized by significant mid - ir absorption which",
    ", nonetheless , is not associated to a deep silicate absorption feature at 9.7@xmath4 m which is expected by a galactic extinction curve . since this silicate feature",
    "is produced by grains smaller than a few @xmath4 m , a dust distribution dominated by large grains can also explain this `` anomaly '' of the mid - ir spectra of sy2s , as discussed in the following .",
    "we take the optical depth at 7.7@xmath4 m as representative of the featureless absorption in the vicinity of the silicate feature .",
    "we specifically choose this wavelength because is the location of the pah whose equivalent width is used by clavel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) to determine the mid - ir absorption .",
    "the difference of the optical depths @xmath65 is an alternative way to measure the equivalent width of the silicate feature , as long as it is not saturated .",
    "the ratio @xmath66 is a measure of the depth of the silicate feature relative to the featureless mid - ir absorption . in fig .",
    "6 the upper horizontal line indicates the standard galactic value of this ratio , while the lower horizontal line indicates the ( mean ) upper limit of this ratio for sy2s , as inferred from the data in clavel et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and the shaded area gives the spread of the upper limits ( as inferred from the spread of the ew of the pah at 7.7@xmath4 m ) .",
    "6 illustrates in different terms what already discussed in paper i : the upper limit on the depth of the silicate feature in the average spectrum of sy2s is about one order of magnitude lower than expected from the galactic extinction curve .",
    "the curves plotted in the diagram show the expected @xmath67 ratio according to the coagulation models discussed in sect.3.2 .",
    "in particular , the dashed line refers to the model presented in sect.3.2.1 ( q constant and equal to 3.5 ) and is related to the upper abscissa scale , while the solid curves refer to the models presented in sects.3.2.2 and 3.2.3 ( @xmath44 constant ) and are related to the lower abscissa scale .",
    "all of these models predict a depth of the silicate feature significantly lower than galactic . the model with @xmath68",
    "can easily fit the constrain given by the mid - ir observations , with q just slightly lower than the canonical value of 3.5 .",
    "as mentioned in paper i ( sect.4.1 ) , the inner ( hotter ) mid - ir emitting region probably is not featureless but is also characterized by the 9.7@xmath4 m feature in emission .",
    "since the upper limit on @xmath69 was determined assuming an intrinsic featureless continuum , the possible presence of the 9.7@xmath4 m feature in emission should relax such an upper limit .",
    "however , as mentioned in paper i , the equivalent width of the 9.7@xmath4 m emission feature is so small that the upper limit on @xmath70 would increase by a quantity of 0.15 at most , which certainly can not account for the the discrepancy with the value expected for the galactic case ( fig .",
    "finally , we wish to emphasize that the presence of strong pah features in the iso spectra of seyfert galaxies is not in contractdiction with our large grain model , since such pah features most likely come from the host galaxy ( where the dust properties are probably similar to the galactic ism ) and not from the nuclear region .",
    "in sects.3.2 and 3.3 we only considered the effects of coagulation by increasing @xmath71 and by decreasing q , since these are the parameters which primarily affect r@xmath43 , @xmath0 , @xmath1 and the silicate feature .",
    "the latter quantities are instead little sensitive to @xmath39 . however , this is not the case for the carbon dip which , in the model of mathis et al .",
    "( 1977 ) is ascribed to graphite grains with sizes in the range 100 200 . in particular , the carbon dip is washed away from the extinction curve if coagulation depletes small grains by increasing @xmath39 above 200 .",
    "this is shown in fig .  7 , where we plot the variation in the uv shape extinction curve by modifying the dust distribution to have @xmath72 and leaving @xmath38 and q to the standard values of 0.25 and 3.5 , respectively .",
    "note that recent studies have shown that most of the profile of the 2175  dip is probably produced by even smaller grains ( pahs , weingartner & draine 2000 ) that are not included in our model .",
    "obviously , in this case the depletion of small grains onto larger grains through coagulation would be even more effective in removing the 2175  dip .    as a consequence ,",
    "the coagulation scenario is also supported by the lack of a prominent carbon dip in spectra of reddened sy1s ( paper i ) .",
    "however , the depletion of small grains can also be achieved with other physical processes ( eg .",
    "sublimation , sect.2.5 ) and , therefore , the absence of the carbon dip alone can not be used to rule out other scenarios . yet , whatever is the mechanism responsible for depleting small grains , the absence of the carbon dip certainly indicates that the properties of dust in agns are different from galactic and , in particular , that the dust distribution is biased in favor of large grains .",
    "we have discussed various interpretations of the observational evidences for `` anomalous '' properties of dust in the circumnuclear region of agns and , in particular , the reduced @xmath0 , the reduced @xmath1 , the absence of the silicate absorption feature in the mid - ir spectra of sy2s and the absence of the carbon dip in the uv spectra of reddened sy1s , which are reported in a companion paper ( maiolino et al . 2000 ,",
    "paper i ) .",
    "a dust distribution dominated by large grains as a consequence of coagulation is the interpretation which best fit the various observational constraints .",
    "the formation of large grains is naturally expected in the high density environment characterizing the circumnuclear region of agns .",
    "a dust grain distribution biased in favor of large grains makes the extinction curve flatter than galactic and featureless ( especially for what concerns the silicate mid - ir feature and the uv carbon dip ) .",
    "coagulation also yields a reduced @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "it should be noted that nearly all of the papers , published so far , dealing with the effects of dust in agns have adopted a standard galactic extinction curve ( essentially with the only exception of laor & draine 1993 , who first proposed the large grain scenario ) .",
    "the assumption that the properties of dust in the extreme conditions of the circumnuclear region of agns are similar to the galactic diffuse interstellar medium is somewhat naive , given that even in the denser clouds of our galaxy the extinction curve is already different with respect to the diffuse medium .",
    "probably , many of the past studies considering the effects of dust obscuration and scattering in agns should be revised at the light of the findings obtained in this paper .    with regard to the scattered radiation ( especially in obscured agns )",
    "it is worth noting that a dust distribution dominated by large grains would yield a nearly gray reflection , thus mimicking the scattering by free electrons .",
    "large grains produced by dust coagulation would have a reduced scattering efficiency with respect to the standard galactic dust mixture .",
    "however , while in some cases coagulation can result in a reduction of the scattering efficiency by more than an order of magnitude , for some of the dust grain distributions producing a flat extinction and scattering curve the reduction in the scattering efficincy is much lower ( e.g. for the model discussed in 3.2.2 the scattering efficiency is reduced by a factor of @xmath32 ) . therefore , it is possible that some of the gray  reflected spectra found in some obscured agns , and ascribed to electron scattering , might actually be produced by large grains scattering .",
    "we have also examined other possible interpretations for the `` anomalous '' dust properties discussed in paper i , and more specifically : + 1 ) a metallicity higher than solar ( as often found in the central region of agns ) might affect the estimate of the equivalent n@xmath2 from the photoelectric cutoff in the hard x - rays ; + 2 ) the observed broad lines might be scattered by a reflecting medium through a path of much lower gaseous column than the x - rays ; + 3 ) reduction of the scattering component of the extinction curve as a consequence scattering of the radiation into our beam ; + 4 ) the blr might have a size comparable to that of the absorbing medium ( at variance with what assumed by the standard unified model ) and , therefore , suffer less absorption with respect to the nuclear x - ray source ; + 5 ) the hard x - rays might be partly absorbed by the same clouds which produce the broad lines ; + 6 ) the sublimation of dust at the inner face of the obscuring torus would produce a gaseous dust - free region ; + 7 ) the absorbing medium might simply be characterized by a low dust  to  gas ratio ( in terms of mass ) .",
    "although some of these cases might apply to some of the objects examined in paper i , none of them can fit all of the observational constraints for most of the objects , at variance with the large grains scenario .",
    "we are grateful to b. draine for enlightening discussions during the early stages of this work .",
