    "liquid - liquid phase separation is an appealing mechanism for building materials with tailored microstructure  @xcite .",

    "are first responsible for the growth of composition fluctuations .",
    "then the size of domains of fixed composition increases in order to minimize interfacial energy  a later stage called _ coarsening _",
    "the ability to tune the typical size of the microstructure by controlling coarsening kinetics is paramount for applications of phase separation , among which porous glasses  @xcite and membranes  @xcite , cellular materials for the food industry  @xcite , core - shell particles  @xcite , quantum dots  @xcite or super - hydrophobic thin films  @xcite .    for most materials , coarsening results from molecular diffusion through interfaces between the phases , transporting matter from highly - curved interfaces to flatter interfaces .",
    "this mechanism operates whatever the topology of the phases  either for interconnected domains or for droplets  @xcite .",
    "diffusive coarsening is a slow transport mechanism , with the typical domain size growing with time @xmath1 as @xmath2 .",
    "only limited variations in domain sizes with heating time can therefore be observed in experiments . amongst inorganic materials , a large body of the phase separation literature",
    "is devoted to silicate melts  @xcite .",
    "the seminal theoretical work of cahn  @xcite finds its inspiration in the geometry of phase - separated sodium borosilicate glasses .",
    "kinetic studies in silicates evidenced diffusive coarsening both for a droplet  @xcite and an interconnected microstructure  @xcite . because of the limited range of sizes that are observable during a @xmath2 evolution , a more successful approach for controlling the microstructure size consists in leveraging thermodynamics instead of kinetics , by changing the composition in order to modify the value of the critical temperature .",
    "martel et al .",
    "@xcite , for example , found that the typical size of phase - separated droplets decreased exponentially with alumina content in calcium aluminosilicate glasses .",
    "a similar strategy has been applied to metallic glasses  @xcite .    however",
    ", another coarsening mechanism has been proposed for larger domain sizes , namely hydrodynamic coarsening , that can occur because of viscous flow driven by laplace pressure  @xcite .",
    "this regime is characterized by a linear growth of domain sizes with time , that should be much more flexible to tune the microstructure , for a given composition . several numerical studies  @xcite have addressed hydrodynamic coarsening ; however , experimental observations of this regime are confined to the field of colloid - polymer mixtures  @xcite and polymers  @xcite , with no single experimental evidence in the field of inorganic materials .",
    "since mechanisms such as crystallization ( in alloys and glass - forming melts ) , gravity or convection and shear often disrupt coarsening and result in different morphologies , one may wonder if a linear growth of domains can be observed at all in inorganic materials .",
    "new insights on phase separation paralleled the emergence of experimental techniques in materials science . whereas the first kinetic studies were realized in the fourier space , using light diffusion techniques  @xcite , direct access to the morphology of the phases is now possible thanks to imaging techniques such as electronic microscopy  @xcite , atomic force microscopy  @xcite , x - ray tomography  @xcite or atom probe tomography  @xcite .",
    "in - situ synchrotron microtomography  @xcite is a technique of choice for studying microstructure formation  @xcite , since it provides both the 3-d microstructure and its topology , and successive snapshots of its evolution .",

    "we investigate the coarsening stage of a barium borosilicate glass - forming melt , far above its glass transition .",
    "thanks to in - situ tomography , we evidence a linear growth of the microstructure with time , characteristic of viscous coarsening , that is shown to stem from a series of hydrodynamic pinch - offs . in section  [ sec : matmet ] , we present the materials and methods used in this work , in particular the characterization of the glasses and the in - situ tomography experiments .",

    "finally , we discuss in section  [ sec : discussion ] the relative importance of diffusive and viscous transport in our system .",
    "in this work , we focus on the ternary diagram @xmath3 . while alkali borosilicates have been much studied in the literature , alkaline - earth borosilicates are known to have a higher critical temperature , and a larger immiscibility domain  @xcite . the immiscibility diagram determined by levin and cleek  @xcite",

    "it corresponds to a composition well inside the immiscibility domain in order to obtain an interconnected microstructure , and to a liquidus temperature of @xmath5c .    in order to study submicronic microstructures ,",
    "we have studied a second glass composition with a small percentage of alumina  @xcite , denoted as _ quaternary glass _ in table [ tab : tab ] and subsequently . since the quaternary diagram has not yet been characterized in the literature , we determined the dome temperature for this composition by thermal treatments at different temperatures , followed by a rapid quench in water .",
    "the dome temperature was estimated to be @xmath6c ( @xmath7c ) .    for the elaboration of the glasses ,",

    "the composition used in tomography experiments corresponds to the _ ternary glass _ point.[fig : diagram ] ]      determining phase compositions in demixed glasses is usually a difficult endeavour because of the submicronic size of the domains .",
    "typical methods use selective dissolution in acid  @xcite or compare dsc plots to previously - determined glass - transition isotherms  @xcite , but such methods often lack precision . in our system , large sizes of the domains ( several tens of microns ) can easily be obtained , which made it possible to analyze the compositions by electron microprobe .",
    "thermal treatments were realized at @xmath12c and @xmath13c for the ternary glass .",
    "the composition of the phases was analyzed using a cameca sx 100 microprobe at 15 kv and 15 na .",

    "the precision of the microprobe measurements  of the order of 1 wt% because of the incertitude on boron content  is not sufficient to distinguish between the silica - rich compositions at @xmath12c and @xmath13c .",
    "interestingly , phases at @xmath12c and @xmath13c lie on the same tie - line , therefore no tie - line rotation is observed in such a temperature range ( contrary to other studies made at lower temperature  @xcite , closer to the glass transition ) .      as will be described later , the kinetics of domain coarsening is governed by the ratio between the interfacial tension between the two phases , and the viscosity of the most viscous phase . in order to characterize the physical properties of the separated phases , glasses with the composition of the silica - rich phase , and the barium - rich phases at @xmath12c and @xmath13c , were melted from raw materials using the same procedure as for the ternary glass .

    "is multiplied by more than one order of magnitude during the duration of an experiment .",
    "the coarsening rate increases with temperature , and several experiments performed at the same temperature show that the value of the coarsening rate is well reproduced ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lengths ] ) . in order to characterize the temperature - dependence of the coarsening rate ,",
    "we have plotted @xmath43 in an arrhenian diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : arrhenius ] , for 11 different experiments realized from @xmath44 to @xmath27c .",

    "[ fig : arrhenius ] correspond to different volume fractions of the barium - rich phase , from 39 to 52 @xmath46 .",
    "such variability does not seem to affect the arrhenian behavior .    in order to test the validity of the linear coarsening regime at smaller scales , we measured the typical size of interconnected phases for thermal treatments at @xmath25c of the quaternary glass with alumina , using post - mortem sem imaging .",
    "since @xmath22 can not be directly measured from 2d images , we measured as a proxy for @xmath22 the average chord size @xmath36 , the chord size distribution  @xcite being a stereological measure that should be identical in 2d and 3d for statistically isotropic systems .",
    "as shown in the inset of fig .",

    "this slight discrepancy at short times and small scales is likely to come from variations in the initial size of the microstructure , since our post - mortem observations were realized on different samples .",
    "we conclude that a linear coarsening can be observed at scales ranging from 1 to 80 @xmath0 m , including scales below the resolution of our tomography experiments .",
    "c.[fig : pinchoff ] ]    the observed linear evolution of @xmath22 suggests that viscous coarsening dominates over diffusive mechanisms .",
    "this may come as a surprise , since diffusive coarsening has been the only mechanism reported so far in silicate melts  @xcite .",
    "3-d visualizations of the evolution of interfaces ( fig .",

    "laplace pressure causes fluid to flow from regions with a high mean curvature towards regions with smaller curvatures .",

    "[ fig : pinchoff ] ( c ) ) . after",
    "the break - up , fluid in the broken ends retracts because of capillarity and therefore flows in adjacent regions ( fig .",

    "local break - up events of viscous liquid bridges are also known as _ pinch - off _ in the fluid mechanics literature  @xcite .",
    "they were observed using confocal microscopy in a colloid - polymer mixture by aarts and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "further evidence for the weak influence of diffusion on coarsening is given by the fact that a few isolated domains ( displayed in purple in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarsening ] ) keep a constant volume through time , so that evaporation can be considered negligible up to the measurement precision .",
    "visual observation also sheds light on the origin of the few isolated domains , that break up from the continuous phase during the retraction of long terminal filaments  @xcite ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : gerris ] ) .    thanks to such direct observations of coarsening mechanisms , it is possible to revisit the theoretical argument of siggia  @xcite for deriving a linear coarsening rate with time .",
    "one balances the dominant terms of the navier - stokes equation , that are the laplace pressure gradient and the viscous dissipation , when inertia is negligible : @xmath47 with @xmath48 the largest viscosity of the two phases , @xmath18 the interfacial tension , @xmath49 a typical velocity of the fluid and the laplace pressure @xmath50 .",
    "siggia argues that @xmath51 , since @xmath22 is the typical scale of fluid domains . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pinchoff ] , @xmath49 would be a typical velocity at which fluid flows from the bridge to the node , either when the bridge is still connected or when the broken ends retract .",
    "the growth of @xmath22 in neighboring liquid bridges is due to the redistribution of the fluid from the thinning , then breaking , liquid bridge . replacing @xmath49 ,",
    "one obtains the equation proposed by siggia : @xmath52    in order to test whether eq . ( [ eq : visc ] ) describes well the coarsening dynamics observed here ,",
    "we have compared in fig .",

    "the estimated interfacial tension over the measured viscosity of the silica - rich phase is therefore superimposed on fig .",

    "we observe a very good agreement between @xmath54 and @xmath40 : the activation energies of the two quantities are very close .",
    "moreover , the proportionality coefficient between @xmath54 and @xmath40 seems to be close to one . the good quantitative agreement between our measurements and eq .",

    "statistical characterizations of the domain geometry allow us to test the dynamic scaling hypothesis . in order to characterize the geometry of the system , we compute histograms of surface curvatures , for an experiment at @xmath5c",
    ". distributions of curvatures are a common tool for a local characterization of interfaces , in particular for coarsening studies  @xcite .",

    "a good collapse on a master curve is observed both for mean and gaussian curvature , demonstrating that , statistically speaking , the morphology of the phases does not change over time , except for their average size .",
    "the validity of dynamic scaling means that it is possible to elaborate morphologies that are statistically similar , but with sizes that are different .",
    "such property can be interesting for applications but also for designing model materials .    nevertheless , one should mention that deviations from dynamic scaling can be observed at longer times , because of the progressive fragmentation of disconnected droplets from the percolating low - viscosity phase .",
    "such domains can be observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : coarsening ] and  [ fig : pinchoff ] .",
    "we have studied deviations from dynamic scaling in a previous paper  @xcite .",
    "recent work  @xcite has shown that the fragmentation rate increases drastically when the volume fraction of the low - density phase decreases . in the set of experiments presented here ,",

    "the prevailing transport mechanism is chemical diffusion through the boundary of the domains ( droplets coalescence because of brownian motion  @xcite is bound to be slower because of the micronic size of droplets and the very large viscosity of the matrix ) .",

    "the corresponding crossover time @xmath79 would be of the order of 0.1 s. observing only the hydrodynamic regime at micronic scales was therefore to be expected .    in this respect ,",

    "simmons et al .",
    "@xcite measured the evolution of the macroscopic viscosity resulting from coarsening in sodium borosilicate glasses . using the values obtained for @xmath48 and @xmath69 in  @xcite and eq .",
    "( [ eq : crossover ] ) , one obtains a crossover scale of a few microns and an hypothetical crossover time of thousands of days .",
    "observing the hydrodynamic regime requires @xmath80 to be accessible in an experiment , and hence the viscosity of the glass not to be too large .",
    "since most previous studies in glass - forming melts were realized slightly above the glass transition , the viscosity was always very high ( @xmath81 ) and the hydrodynamic regime was out of reach .",
    "an interesting perspective of our study would be the investigation of the crossover of the diffusive and hydrodynamic regimes .",
    "such investigations would require to control the critical temperature so that the viscosity just below @xmath82 would result in a crossover time well resolved experimentally .",
    "let us finally note that simple models relating the viscosity and the diffusivity , such as the stokes - einstein relation , or the eyring model  @xcite for silicate glasses , result in a crossover length @xmath83 of the same order as a typical molecular size .",
    "observations of diffusive coarsening over larger scales  @xcite therefore hint at more complex diffusive mechanisms that are decoupled from viscosity  a decoupling that is well known for silicate glasses close to their glass transition  @xcite and that has been recently discussed for metallic glasses as well  @xcite .",
    "using in - situ microtomography , we have shown that viscous flow prevails as the dominant coarsening mechanism in phase - separated silicate melts , for temperatures far above the glass transition .",
    "a linear growth of the typical size has been observed for a large range of scales , from 1 to 80 @xmath0 m .",
    "we have verified that the morphology remains statistically self - similar during coarsening , up to a rescaling by the characteristic size .",
    "whether these mechanisms apply to other inorganic materials , such as phase - separated bulk metallic glasses  @xcite , is an open question of interest for the fundamental understanding of such materials .",
    "the transition between the diffusive and viscous regime is an interesting question open by this work , that will require to understand which diffusive mechanisms control the coarsening at small scales .",
    "future work will focus on smaller volume fractions on the less - viscous phase , for which more fragmentation of droplets is observed .",
    "the authors are much grateful to sophie schuller for lending them the falling - sphere apparatus for the viscosity measurements .",
    "the authors also acknowledge precious help from yohann bale , erick lamotte , rudy vetro and jean - paul valade .",
    "this work was supported by the french anr program",
    " eddam \" ( anr-11-bs09 - 027 ) .",
    "experiments were performed on beamline id19 at esrf in the framework of projects hd501 , sc3724 , ma1839 and ma1876 .",
    "in order to estimate the interfacial tension between the two phases , we performed numerical simulations with the gerris software  @xcite , a finite - volume solver of navier - stokes equations .",
    "as an initial condition , a mesh was built from the segmentation of a single domain in an experiment at @xmath5c ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gerris ] ) .",
    "physical parameters of the simulation were set to one , including the size of the box , the interfacial tension between the phases and the viscosity of the most viscous phase .",
    "the viscosity of the least viscous phase was set to @xmath84 , ensuring a high viscosity ratio between the phases .",
    "the viscosity ratio in the simulation is not as large as the experimental one , since too large a discrepancy between the two viscosities leads to prohibitive computational times .",
    "such parameters ensure that the reynolds number is smaller than 0.1 . for reynolds numbers much smaller than 1 , in the stokes flow regime , inertia is negligible and time is only a parameter , with boundary conditions determining completely the further evolution of the system .",
    "[ fig : gerris ] shows the evolution of the initial condition in the experiment , as well as in the simulation of navier - stokes equations .",
    "a striking similarity is observed between the experimental and numerical geometries . in particular , the domain breaks up at the same place , while the lower end of the domain retracts in both cases .",
    "such observations confirm that hydrodynamic flow is the mechanism responsible for the observed coarsening .",
    "moreover , the proportionality factor needed to adjust experimental and non - dimensional numerical times gives the value of the interfacial tension in the experiment , that is found to be @xmath85 .",
    "we suppose that the interfacial tension does not vary much with temperature , which is a reasonable assumption compared to the much greater variations of the viscosities with temperature .    c. the size of the square box is 190 @xmath0 m .",
    "lower row : evolution of the same domain with the gerris code , with a linear factor between numerical and experimental times chosen to optimize the match between geometries .",
