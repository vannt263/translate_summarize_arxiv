    "nonunique factorization theory aims to classify and quantify the failure of elements of cancellative commutative monoids to factor uniquely into irreducibles @xcite .",
    "factorization invariants are arithmetic quantities that measure the failure of a monoid s elements to admit unique factorizations .",
    "there are many standard invariants used in the literature to compare factorization behavior between monoids , such as the delta set @xcite , elasticity @xcite , and @xmath3-primality @xcite .",
    "most factorization invariants assign a value to each monoid element determined by its factorization structure . in examining the behavior of an invariant throughout the whole monoid ,",
    "one often considers quantities such as the supremum of all values attained at its elements , or the set of all such values .",
    "for instance , the elasticity of a monoid element is defined as the ratio of its largest and smallest factorization lengths , and the elasticity of the monoid is simply the supremum of the elasticities of its elements .",
    "this paper concerns the catenary degree ( definition  [ d : catenarydegree ] ) , a factorization invariant that has been the subject of much recent work @xcite .",
    "the catenary degree @xmath4 of a monoid element @xmath5 is a nonnegative integer derived from combinatorial properties of the set of factorizations of @xmath0 .",
    "although much of the literature on the catenary degree focuses on the maximum catenary degree attained within @xmath1 , some recent papers @xcite examine the catenary degees of individual monoid elements . in this paper , we investigate the set @xmath2 of catenary degrees occurring within @xmath1 as a factorization invariant , focusing on the setting where @xmath1 is finitely generated .",
    "the catenary degree @xmath4 of a monoid element @xmath5 is closely related to the delta set @xmath6 ( definition  [ d : factorizations ] ) , although neither completely determines the other .",
    "the factorization invariants @xmath7 and @xmath8 , both of which are standard in the literature , describe the factorization structure of @xmath1 at drastically different levels of detail .",
    "indeed , one maintains a comprehensive set of values , while the other records only a single value .",
    "the set @xmath2 of catenary degrees of @xmath1 more closely resembles the delta set @xmath9 , as it provides a more comparably detailed description of the factorization structure of @xmath1 .",
    "the goal of this paper is to provide an initial examination of the set @xmath2 , as well as to motivate further study .",
    "it is known from @xcite that @xmath10 , the maximum catenary degree attained within a given monoid @xmath1 , always occurs at least once within a certain finite class of elements of @xmath1 called betti elements ( definition  [ d : bettielement ] ) .",
    "this result was later extended to monoids satisfying a certain weakened noetherian condition @xcite .",
    "the second author of @xcite conjectured that when @xmath1 is finitely generated , the minimum nonzero value of @xmath2 also occurs at a betti element of @xmath1 .",
    "as the main result of this paper , we prove the aformetioned conjecture ( theorem  [ c : mincatdegree ] ) .",
    "this yields a computable bound on the values occurring in @xmath2 , as well as a characterization of those finitely gererated monoids @xmath1 for which @xmath11 is minimal .",
    "we also give in example  [ e : catenaryset ] a semigroup whose set of catenary degrees has a nonzero element that does not occur at a betti element , demonstrating that this result need not extend to the entire set @xmath2 .    in section  [ s : extremecatset ] , we give several examples that demonstrate certain extremal behavior of @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , we show that if a monoid @xmath1 has at least @xmath12 minimal generators , then @xmath11 can not be bounded by the number of generators of @xmath1 ( theorem  [ t : largecatset ] ) .",
