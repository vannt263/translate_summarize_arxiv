    "gauge symmetry breaking through the wilson line phases ( hosotani mechanism)@xcite is one of the most important dynamical phenomena when one considers physics with extra dimensions .",
    "component gauge fields for compactified directions , which are closely related with the wilson line phases , become dynamical variables and develop vacuum expectation values to break dynamically gauge symmetry at the quantum level .",
    "it is expected that the mechanism is crucial for the scenario of the gauge - higgs unification @xcite-@xcite , in which the component gauge field for the compactified direction plays the role of `` higgs '' scalars .",
    "the higgs scalar is unified in part of the gauge potential by the gauge principle , so that the arbitrariness associated with the higgs sector of the standard model can be resolved .",
    "the mechanism induces dynamical gauge symmetry breaking , and it is important to study how the gauge symmetry is broken and/or what the gauge symmetry breaking patterns depend on . the gauge symmetry breaking pattern has been studied extensively in many models @xcite .",
    "it has been reported that the gauge symmetry breaking patterns depend on matter content , that is , the number of massless particles and their boundary conditions .",
    "one of the authors ( k.t ) studied effects of bare mass on the hosotani mechanism on the ground that how global quantities like the wilson line phase is affected by massive particles @xcite .",
    "it has been found that the existence of the bare mass , depending on its magnitude , actually changes the vacuum structure of the theory , so that the gauge symmetry breaking patterns are modified and are different from that in the theory with only massless particles .    in this paper",
    "we generalize the previous work @xcite to a higher rank gauge group @xmath8 and study the gauge symmetry breaking patterns when one considers matter fields with bare mass terms .",
    "we study how the bare mass affects the gauge symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "namely , we are interested in whether or not the partial gauge symmetry breaking @xmath1 can be realized in the model like it happened in the model with only massless particles @xcite",
    ". we will show two examples , one of which does not realizes the partial gauge symmetry breaking , while the other of which actually does the desirable partial gauge symmetry breaking .",
    "in the two models the matter content is the same to each other , but the relative magnitude among the bare masses is chosen to be different .",
    "we study @xmath9 supersymmetric gauge models in five dimensions with one space coordinate being compactified on @xmath10 .",
    "and we introduce matter fields belonging to the adjoint or fundamental representations under the gauge group .",
    "the matter fields possess gauge invariant but non - supersymmetric bare mass terms .",
    "one usually resorts to the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite in order to break supersymmetry , which gives a natural and simple framework to discuss the gauge symmetry breaking through the wilson lines in supersymmetric gauge models @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we shall consider the non - supersymmetric bare mass term instead of the scherk - schwarz mechanism and see how the term affects on the gauge symmetry breaking patterns .",

    "the on - shell degrees of freedom of the hypermultiplet consist of a dirac fermion @xmath17 and two complex scalars @xmath18 .",
    "we study the model on @xmath0 , where @xmath19 and @xmath10 are the four - dimensional minkowski space and a circle , respectively .",
    "as is well known , the zero mode of the component gauge field for the @xmath10 direction @xmath20 can develop vacuum expectation values .",

    "one usually evaluates the effective potential for the phases @xmath26 s in one - loop approximation by expanding the fields around the background ( [ background ] ) .",
    "the phase is determined dynamically by minimizing the effective potential and the gauge symmetry can be broken down .    if the theory has exact supersymmetry , the effective potential vanishes due to the cancellation of the quantum correction to the background between bosons and fermions .",
    "one needs to break supersymmetry in order to obtain a nonvanishing effective potential .",
    "the scherk - schwarz mechanism of supersymmetry breaking provides us a natural and simple framework to obtain the nonvanishing effective potential .",
    "here we introduce bare mass terms in such a way that the term breaks supersymmetry explicitly even if we do not consider the scherk - schwarz mechanism .    following the standard prescription we obtain the effective potential for the @xmath23 gauge group in one - loop approximation @xcite , up to @xmath26-independent terms , @xmath27 + 4\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i , j=1}^{n}{1\\over n^5}d(z_g , n ) \\cos[n(\\theta_i -\\theta_j-\\beta)]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & 4n^{adj}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i , j=1}^{n}{1\\over n^5 } \\cos[n(\\theta_i -\\theta_j ) ] -4n^{adj}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i , j=1}^{n}{1\\over n^5 } d(z_{adj},n ) \\cos[n(\\theta_i -\\theta_j-\\beta)]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & ( 2\\times 4n^{fd})\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{1\\over n^5 } \\cos[n(\\theta_i)]-(2\\times 4n^{fd } ) \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{1\\over n^5 } d(z_{fd},n)\\cos[n(\\theta_i-\\beta)],\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 the bare mass for the gaugino and squark belonging to the fundamental ( adjoint ) representation is denoted by @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and we have defined the dimensionless quantity @xmath31 .",

    "we notice that the five - dimensional gauge invariance and supersymmetry forbid the mass term for @xmath20 .",
    "this means that the mass scale for @xmath20 must be the one , at which supersymmetry is broken and there is no local gauge invariance in five dimensions .",
    "in fact the mass term for @xmath20 is estimated , aside from numerical constants , as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the gauge coupling in four dimensions and @xmath101 are the on - shell degrees of freedom , the number of flavors , respectively .",
    "@xmath102 stands for the bare mass @xmath103 .",
    "we also observe that , as expected , the original supersymmetry protects the mass term for @xmath20 against the large quantum correction of @xmath104 for the case of @xmath105 .",

    "and we have studied the effect of the bare mass on the gauge symmetry breaking patterns .    in order to study the vacuum structure of the model",

    ", the magnitude of the bare mass actually affects the vacuum structure of the model and changes the gauge symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "we have given two examples , in which the residual gauge symmetry is different .",
    "for a parameter set given by ( [ seta ] ) , the gauge symmetry breaking patterns is ( [ patterna ] ) .",

    "it is interesting to investigate the partial gauge symmetry breaking @xmath106 , which is important in connection with gut .",
    "we also mention that the order parameter changes smoothly according to the change of @xmath51 in our example , so that the phase transition is the second order .    as far as our numerical analyses are concerned",
    ", it seems that the hierarchical structure of the bare mass @xmath107 may be essential for the partial gauge symmetry breaking for the present number of flavors .",
    "needless to say , one needs much more study in order to confirm the statement .",

    "one can introduce the field that satisfy the antiperiodic boundary condition , keeping the singlevaluedness of the lagrangian density .",

    "is also a vacuum for this parameter set ( [ setc ] ) , a little bit smaller @xmath50 , _",
    "e.g. _ @xmath112 makes a vacuum that realize the partial gauge symmetry breaking the global minimum . ]",
    "this shows that in addition to the magnitude of the bare mass , the periodicity of the matter field also changes the gauge symmetry breaking patterns .",
    "this is an interesting problem to study further .",
    "it is also important to study the effect of the bare mass on the gauge symmetry breaking patterns in case of orbifold , for instance , @xmath113 . in particular , it is interesting to study how the bare mass affects the mass of the higgs scalar embedded in @xmath20 as studied in @xcite @xcite .",
