    "coherence of a quantum state is very fragile because of the existence of its environmental degrees of freedom coupled to it , which has become the major obstacle in constructing quantum computer @xcite . to protect the quantum information",
    ", we generally use the quantum error correction scheme which can correct the quantum errors to protect the encoded quantum states@xcite ; we can also use the scheme to find the decoherence - free subspaces and some other schemes to protect the quantum information@xcite .",
    "generally we need several physical qubits to realize one logic qubit in these schemes .",
    "it will be very interesing if we can find a quantum systems in which the quantum states can be naturally protected .",
    "on the other hand , many physicists took attention to the relationship among the concepts of environment , decoherence , and irreversibility , these investigations may provide new perspective of how to overcome decoherence and renewed understanding for the crossover between quantum and classical behavior @xcite . in the study of quantum - classical transition in quantum chaos ,",
    "the concept of loschmidt echo(le ) was introduced@xcite , and we will use it to determine decoherence of a central system .    with the development of quantum information , the concept of entanglement ( concurrence ) was used to investigate the quantum phase transition(qpt ) osborne , vidal .",
    "recently , carollo and pachos @xcite have established the relation between geometric phases(gp ) and criticality of spin chain , zhu @xcite analyzed the scaling of the geometric phases , and hamma @xcite found that a non - contractible gp of the ground state is also a witness of qpt .",
    "et al _ @xcite found that the decay of the le is enhanced by quantum criticality in ising spin-1/2 model .",
    "these particular features in the xy model above seem to imply that there exist distinct properties with respect to decoherence of a central quantum system surrounded by it . in this paper , we show that the anisotropy parameter @xmath0 affects decoherence of the central system sensitively when @xmath1 $ ] , in particular , the le becomes unit without varying with time when @xmath2 , implying that environment - induced decoherence vanishes .",
    "some other cases in which the le is unit are discussed also .",
    "firstly , we analyze the xy model as a starting point , since it is exactly solvable and presents a rich structure .",
    "the system - bath model can be described by the hamiltonian @xmath3 , the central ( two - state ) system , characterized by the ground state @xmath4  and the excited state @xmath5 has a free hamiltonian @xmath6 and is coupled to all spins in the bath through the interaction @xmath7 where @xmath8 represents the coupling constant .",
    "our model differs from the model in @xcite where the system only interacts with the first spin in the bath .",
    "the chain in a transverse field has nearest neighbor interactions with hamiltonian expressed by @xmath9where @xmath10 for @xmath11 odd , and the operators @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) are the usual pauli operators defined on the @xmath14-th site of the lattice .",

    "interestingly , we find that the @xmath70 does not vary with time in the xx model with @xmath19 , i.e. , the coherence of the central spin will not be affected by the special environment .",
    "the reasons are in the following . from eqs.([5]-[7 ] ) , we see that @xmath90 = \\pm 1 , \\label{11}\\]]which directly results in that the ground state of @xmath28 no longer lies in the two - dimensional hilbert space spanned by @xmath91 and @xmath92 , but only one of them like eq.([12 ] ) . to obtain the explicit form of the ground state ,",
    "we let @xmath93 and @xmath94 in eq.([7 ] ) , and from them know that @xmath95 . considering eqs.([7]-[9 ] ) , we can express the ground state @xmath96since @xmath97 in eq.([9 ] ) when @xmath98 , and @xmath99 ( @xmath98 ) or @xmath100 ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "therefore the le becomes @xmath102which means that the @xmath70 , initial equal to 1 , will not decay at all , and the central system preserves its initial coherence except for an additional phase factor in one of eigenstate of the central system . for our model with the central system surrounded by the xx spin-1/2 bath , notice that the purity @xcite",
    "@xmath103 tr@xmath104 is defined to describe decoherence , it is @xmath105=1 $ ] also , independent of the central system and this special environment .",
    "what s more , the result ( [ 13 ] ) is regardless of the number @xmath11 of the lattice and what the external magnetic field @xmath83 is , it seems to be counterintuitive , but it is indeed the case .",
    "we can see fig.1(d ) . at the same time , we emphasize that the non - decay of the le in this case is nontrivial because of the difference between @xmath28 and @xmath106 .    the result can be better understood as follows .",
    "evolving from the initial system - environment state @xmath107 , which are not entangled , it becomes @xmath108 at an arbitrary @xmath65 , where @xmath109 and @xmath110 are driven by the hamiltonians @xmath28 and @xmath106 , respectively .",
    "it is known that @xmath28 and @xmath106 are different , however , it happens that the anisotropy parameter @xmath19 leads to their same evolution , resulting in @xmath111 .",
    "the real time - dependent @xmath112 denotes an additional phase factor .",
    "finally , we assume that the xx model environment to be initially prepared in an arbitrary excited state with @xmath19 .",
    "a @xmath113-particle state has the form @xmath114 , with all the @xmath115 distinct , i.e. , it is @xmath116where @xmath117 substituting eq.([ee ] ) into eq.([a ] ) , we find that the le is @xmath118 also , which implies that the partial excited states of the environment does not induce decoherence to the central system . however , if the environment is initially prepared in a thermal state , the le is no longer equal to unit , but will decay with time .    of particular interest is the case in which the xy model lies initially in an excited state . the @xmath119-particle state can be written as @xmath120 .",
    "\\label{tt}\\end{aligned}\\]]after calculation by substituting eq.([tt ] ) into eq.([a ] ) the le  is derived as @xmath121 $ ] with @xmath122 .",
    "it can be seen that : ( i ) the excited states @xmath123 have no any contributions to modulating the le ;  ( ii ) if all the particles are excited , i.e. , @xmath124 , which is assumed to be the initial state of the bath , the le of the central system is unit also .",
    "notice that if the initial state of the xy model bath is thermal , the le of the central system will decay with time .",
    "the vanishing decoherence may arise in view of the non - interacting environments in @xcite : if we let all spins lie initially in either up or down , the decoherence factor will be unit as well .",
    "it is worthwhile for us to find out its physical nature .",
    "in summary , for a central system uniformly coupled to a xy spin-1/2 bath in a transverse field , we explicitly calculate the loschmidt echo(le ) to characterize decoherence quantitatively .",
    "we find that the anisotropy parameter @xmath125 affects decoherence of the central system sensitively when @xmath1 $ ] , in particular , the le becomes unit without varying with time when @xmath2 , implying that environment - induced decoherence vanishes . at the same time , we show that decoherence can vanish provided that the initial state of the xx spin-1/2 bath lies in either the ground state or the partial particles are excited , or it lies in the state that all particles are excited .",
    "although it is difficult to make the initial state of the spin bath pure at zero temperature and then difficult to fulfil the vanishing decoherence in real experiments , in a theoretical sense , our findings may shed light on understanding of decoherence .",
