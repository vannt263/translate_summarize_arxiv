    "we have performed structure searches with up to 20 atoms in the unit cell at pressures in the range 0 - 850 gpa for the mg - o system .",
    "these searches yielded mgo as a stable oxide , but additionally two new compounds were predicted to be stable in the regions of high and low oxygen chemical potential , respectively . to confirm this and to obtain the most accurate results , we then focused search on two separate regions of chemical space ; mg - mgo and mgo - mg , respectively .",
    "since the structures in the two regions exhibit different properties , we report them separately .",
    "it is well known that monovalent ( h - cs ) and divalent ( be - ba and zn - hg ) elements are able to form not only normal oxides , but also peroxides and even superoxides @xcite ( for instance , bao@xmath0 has been well studied at both ambient and high pressure @xcite ) .",
    "our structure prediction calculations did confirm that magnesium peroxide exists at ambient pressure , and has a cubic pyrite - type structure , with _",
    "_ pa__3 symmetry and 12 atoms in the unit cell - in good agreement with experimental results @xcite . in this cubic phase ,",
    "mg is octahedrally coordinated by oxygen atoms ( which form o@xmath0 dumbbells ) , see fig .",
    "2a . however , _ _",
    "pa__3 mgo@xmath0 ( @xmath6-mgo@xmath0 from now on ) is calculated to have a positive formation enthalpy from mg and o@xmath0 , and is therefore metastable .",
    "the calculation shows that on increasing pressure , @xmath6-mgo@xmath0 transforms into a tetragonal form with the space group _ _ i__4/_mcm_. in the @xmath7-mgo@xmath0 phase ( fig .",
    "2b ) , mg is 8-coordinate . here",
    "we see the same trend of change from 6-fold to 8-fold coordination as in the predicted b1-b2 transition in mgo .",
    "but in mgo@xmath0 it happens at mere 53 gpa , compared to 490 gpa for mgo .",
    "most remarkably , above 116 gpa the @xmath7-mgo@xmath0 structure has a negative enthalpy of formation from mgo and o@xmath0 , indicating that @xmath7-mgo@xmath0 becomes thermodynamically stable .",
    "furthermore , its stability is greatly enhanced by pressure and its enthalpy of formation becomes impressively negative , -0.43 ev / atom , at 500 gpa !",
    "we also examined the effect of temperature on its stability by performing quasi - harmonic free energy calculations .",
    "inclusion of thermal effects clearly does not bring any qualitative changes in the formation free energy ( @xmath8@xmath9 ) , and mgo@xmath0 remains stable at high temperatures .",
    "for the mg - rich part of mg - o phase diagram , uspex shows completely unexpected results .",
    "first of all , elemental mg is predicted to undergo several phase transitions induced by pressure : hcp - bcc - fcc - sh . at ambient condition ,",
    "mg adopts the hcp structure , while bcc - mg is stable from 50 gpa to 456 gpa , followed by the transition to fcc and simple hexagonal phase at 456 and 756 gpa , respectively .",
    "these results are in excellent agreement with previous studies @xcite .",
    "mg - rich oxides , such as mg@xmath0o and mg@xmath1o@xmath0 begin to show very competitive enthalpy of formation at pressures above 100 gpa .",
    "however , they are still not stable against decomposition into mg and mgo , and their crystal structures could be thought as a combination of blocks of mg and b1-mgo .",
    "this situation qualitatively changes at 500 gpa , where we find that mg@xmath1o@xmath0 becomes thermodynamically stable .",
    "this new stable phase has a very unusual tetragonal structure with the space group _ _",
    "p__4/_mbm_.    this crystal structure can be viewed as a packing of o atoms and 1d - columns of almost perfect body - centered mg - cubes . as shown in fig .",
    "3 , there are two types of mg atoms in the unit cell , mg1 and mg2 - mg2 atoms form the cubes , filled by mg1 atoms . within the cubic columns , one can notice empty ( mg1)@xmath0(mg2)@xmath3 clusters with the shape of flattened octahedra , with mg - mg distances ranging from 2.08   ( mg1-mg2 ) to 2.43   ( mg2-mg2 ) .",
    "the coordination environments are quite different : each mg1 is bonded to two mg1 atoms and eight mg2 atoms , while each mg2 atoms is bonded to six o atoms ( trigonal prismatic coordination ) .",
    "oxygen atoms in _",
    "t_-mg@xmath1o@xmath0 are coordinated by eight mg2 atoms .",
    "what are the implications of these two compounds for planetary sciences ?",
    "high pressures , required for their stability , are within the range corresponding to deep planetary interiors . in planetary interiors , reducing conditions dominate , related to the excess of metallic iron .",
    "however , given the diversity of planetary bodies it is not impossible to imagine that on some planets strongly oxidized environments can be present at depths corresponding to the pressure of 116 gpa ( in the earth this corresponds to depths below  2600 km ) . at the more usual reducing conditions of planetary interiors ,",
    "mg@xmath1o@xmath0 could exist at pressures above 500 gpa in deep interiors of giant planets .",
    "there , it can coexist in equilibrium with fe ( but probably not with feo , according to our dft and dft+u calculations of the reaction fe + 3mgo @xmath10 feo + mg@xmath1o@xmath0 ) .",
    "according to our calculations ( fig .",
    "4 ) , mg@xmath1o@xmath0 can only be stable at temperatures below 1800 k , which is too cold for deep interiors of giant planets ; however , impurities and entropy effects stemming from defects and disorder might extend its stability field into planetary temperatures .",
    "exotic compounds mgo@xmath0 and mg@xmath1o@xmath0 , in addition to their general chemical interest , might be important planet - forming minerals in deep interiors of some planets .",
    "phonon calculations for mg@xmath1o@xmath0 and mgo@xmath0 at pressures of their stability show that no imaginary phonon frequencies exist throughout brillouin zone , suggesting that these structures are dynamically stable .",
    "together with our calculated thermodynamic functions , this suggests thermodynamic stability of these compounds .",
    "how are these exotic magnesium oxides stabilized at high pressure ? to answer this question , we analyzed the electronic structure and chemical bonding for these compounds .",
    "electron localization function ( elf ) gives information about the bonding character and valence electron configuration of atoms in a compound @xcite .",
    "the elf pictures show asymmetry of the mg - o bonds , indicating significantly ionic character of bonding . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a , valence electrons in @xmath7-mgo@xmath0 are mainly concentrated around o atoms .",
    "charge transfer was also investigated on the basis of the electron density using bader analysis @xcite . in @xmath7-mgo@xmath0 , the net charge on mg",
    "is + 1.747 @xmath11 , indicating the nearly complete transfer of mg 3@xmath12 electrons to o atoms ( just like mg in mgo : bader charges are + 1.737 @xmath11 at 0 gpa and + 1.675 @xmath11 at 600 gpa , respectively ) .",
    "each o has almost 7 valence electrons ( 6.873 @xmath11 ) , thus with the formation of singly bonded o - o dumbbell the octet rule is fulfilled .",
    "each o - o dumbbell can be viewed as a peroxide - ion [ o - o]@xmath2 with a closed - shell electronic configuration .",
    "the elf distribution in @xmath7-mg@xmath1o@xmath0 ( fig . [ fig5]b ) also confirms strong charge transfer from mg to o. however , we surprisingly found a very strong interstitial elf maximum ( _ _ elf__=0.97 ) located in the center of mg - octahedron ( fig .",
    "[ fig5]c ) . to obtain more insight , we performed bader analysis .",
    "the resulting charges are + 1.592 @xmath11 for mg1 , + 1.687 @xmath11 for mg2 , -1.817 @xmath11 for o , and -1.311 @xmath11 for the interstitial electron density maximum .",
    "such a strong interstitial electronic accumulation requires an explanation .",
    "its electronic structure ( fig . [ fig5]e ) exhibits intriguingly high occupancy of mg-@xmath13-orbitals with overlapping energy ranges , which implies a strong mg 3@xmath14 - 3@xmath15 hybridization . at high pressure",
    ", strong interstitial electron localization was found in alkali and alkaline - earth elements , for instance , sodium becomes insulator due to strong core - core orbital overlap @xcite . as a measure of size of the core region we use the mg@xmath16 ionic radius ( 0.72 @xcite ) , while the size of the valence electronic cloud is represented by the 3s orbital radius ( 1.28 @xcite ) . in mg@xmath1o@xmath0 , mg - mg contacts at 500 gpa ( 2.08 a for mg1-mg2 , 2.37 a for mg1-mg1 and 2.43 a for mg2-mg2 ) are only slightly shorter than the sum of valence orbital radii .",
    "thus , the main reason for strong interstitial electronic localization is the formation of strong multicenter covalent bonds between mg atoms ; the core - valence expulsion ( which begins at distances slightly longer than the sum of core and valence radii and increases as the distance decreases ) could also be an important factor for valence electron localization .",
    "strong mg - mg covalent bonding is not normally observed ; the valence shell of the mg atom only has a filled 3@xmath12@xmath17 orbital , a configuration unfavorable for strong bonding . under pressure",
    ", the electronic structure of the mg atom changes ( @xmath14- and @xmath15-levels become significantly populated ) , and strong covalent bonding can appear as a result of the @xmath14-@xmath15 hybridization .",
    "there is another way to describe chemical bonding in this unusual compound .",
    "we remind that mg@xmath1o@xmath0 is anion - deficient compared with mgo ; the extra localized electrons in mg octahedron interstitial play the role of anions , screening mg atoms from each other .",
    "these two descriptions are complementary .",
    "in summary , we performed a systematic search for possible stoichiometries in the mg - o system at pressures up to 850 gpa .",
    "other than the well - known compound , mgo , we found that two more stoichiometries ( mgo@xmath0 and mg@xmath1o@xmath0 ) become thermodynamically stable at pressures above 116 gpa and 500 gpa , respectively .",
    "our analysis reveals that bonding in both @xmath7-mgo@xmath0 and @xmath7-mg@xmath1o@xmath0 exhibits significantly ionic character .",
    "mgo@xmath0 is stabilized by the formation of the peroxide [ o - o]@xmath2 anion , while the strong electron localization in mg octahedron plays the role of an additional anion and makes the anion - deficient compound mg@xmath1o@xmath0 stable .",
    "compared with mgo , which is a wide gap insulator ( dft band gap 7.73 ev at 500 gpa - see fig .",
    "[ fig5]f ) , mg@xmath1o@xmath0 is predicted to have a much narrower band gap ( it is a semiconductor with a dft gap of 2.20 ev ) , while mgo@xmath0 is an insulator with the dft band gap of 5.35 ev ; note that dft gaps are always lower bound to the true gaps .",
    "these two compounds might exist in interiors of other planets , and are thus potentially important for our fundamental understanding of the universe - in addition to presenting striking new chemical phenomena .",
    "searches for the stable compounds and structures were performed using evolutionary algorithm uspex , as implemented in the uspex code@xcite .",
    "this was done in conjunction with _ ab initio _ structure relaxations based on density functional theory ( dft ) within the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized gradient approximation ( gga)@xcite , as implemented in the vasp code@xcite . for structural relaxation , we used the all - electron projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method @xcite and plane wave basis set with the 600 ev kinetic energy cutoff ; brillouin zone was sampled by monkhorst - pack meshes with the resolution 2@xmath18 @xmath19 0.06 @xmath20 .",
    "such calculations provide an excellent description of the known structures ( mg , o@xmath0 , mgo ) and their energetics .",
    "the most significant feature of uspex we used in this work is the capability of searching for a specific area of the composition space - as opposed to the more usual structure predictions at fixed chemical composition .",
    "the desired composition space is described via building blocks ( for example , search for all compositions in a form of [ _ _ x__al@xmath0o@xmath1+__y__mgo ] or [ _ _ x__mg+__y__o ] ) . during the initialization uspex samples the whole range of compositions of interest randomly and sparsely .",
    "chemistry - preserving constraints in the variation operators are lifted and replaced by block - correction scheme which ensures that a child structure is within the desired area of composition space .",
    "a new  chemical transmutation \" operator is introduced @xcite .",
    "stable compositions are determined using the convex hull construction : a compound is thermodynamically stable if the enthalpy of its decomposition into any other compounds is positive . to ensure that the obtained structures are dynamically stable , we calculated phonon frequencies across the brillouin zone using the finite - displacement approach as implemented in the phonopy code@xcite .",
    "we also explored the effects of temperature using the quasiharmonic approximation ; for each structure , phonons were calculated at 10 - 15 different volumes .",
