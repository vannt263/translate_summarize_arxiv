    "nuclear reactions offer the most diverse methods to study nuclei at the limit of stability .",
    "understanding reaction mechanisms in nuclear processes involving nuclei near the driplines is of great importance , particularly at this time , when there is such a high demand for accuracy on the structure information to be extracted from the data .",
    "reaction and structure models are undoubtedly entangled , therefore improving reaction models often implies incorporating more detailed structure models in the description @xcite .",
    "it is generally accepted that , in reactions with loosely bound nuclei , the coupling to the continuum needs to be considered .",
    "continuum effects are very much enhanced in breakup but can also have imprints on other reaction channels , for example elastic and inelastic scattering .",
    "one framework that explicitly includes continuum effects is the continuum discretized coupled channel ( cdcc ) method @xcite .",
    "a large amount of work has been devoted to the analysis of experiments within this framework @xcite and in general results are very good .",
    "the extended continuum discretized coupled channel ( xcdcc ) method @xcite was recently developed .",
    "it brings together a coupled channel description of the projectile with a coupled channel model of the reaction , enabling the description of interference between the multichannel components of the projectile as well as dynamical excitation of the core within the projectile , during the reaction @xcite .",
    "the model has been applied to the breakup of @xmath0be@xmath1be@xmath2 and @xmath3c@xmath4c@xmath2 on @xmath5be at @xmath6 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "the projectiles are described within a two - body @xmath7 multi - channel model , where the core can be in the ground state but also in an excited state .",
    "this model produces breakup cross sections to specific final states of the core , given a coupled channel hamiltonian for the projectile .",
    "results presented in ref .",
    "@xcite show that core excitation effects in the total cross section to the ground state of the core are small , but become very large when considering the total population of the core s excited state .",
    "other differences can be seen in angular and energy distributions but at present no such data is available .",
    "the effect of core excitation needs to be studied in other regimes , for very light and very heavy targets , as well as a variety of energies .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on the proton target . in this case",
    "the process is nuclear driven , and recoil effects are very important .",
    "several reactions of @xmath0be on protons have been measured in a number of facilities , namely elastic scattering at 50 mev / nucleon @xcite , quasi - elastic and breakup at 64 mev / nucleon @xcite as well as transfer at 35 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "@xmath0be proton elastic scattering at 49.3 mev / nucleon was performed in ganil @xcite , at the same time as the elastic scattering of the core @xmath8be at 59.4 mev / nucleon .",
    "even though the outcoming @xmath0be measurements correspond to quasi - elastic , these are essentially elastic as the contribution from the first excited state is negligible .",
    "standard optical potentials ( either density folding as in jlm @xcite or global optical potentials coming from elastic fits as in ch89 @xcite ) could reproduce the @xmath8be elastic reasonably well , requiring small renormalizations of the real and imaginary parts of the interaction ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 for ch89 ) @xcite .",
    "larger renormalizations were required in order to reproduce the distribution of @xmath0be ( @xmath11 or @xmath12 for ch89 ) @xcite .",
    "it is clear from ref .",
    "@xcite that the global optical potential overestimates the elastic cross section for @xmath0be . in ref .",
    "@xcite the elastic scattering of @xmath0be on @xmath13c was successfully described using a @xmath8be+n two - body model , incorporating breakup effects . as the @xmath8be - target interaction was fixed by the @xmath8be elastic scattering data , the large modification in the @xmath0be@xmath14c elastic data was described , without renormalization , purely through breakup effects .",
    "due to the loosely bound nature of the last neutron in @xmath0be this loss of flux from the elastic channel can be attributed to breakup into @xmath8be+n .",
    "it is thus possible that the large renormalizations for @xmath0be scattering on protons @xcite are also due to breakup effects .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , elastic data is only described after large renormalizations of both the real and imaginary part of the @xmath8be+p interaction ( @xmath15 and @xmath16 ) , much larger than those used in ref .",
    "these same renormalizations can no longer describe the @xmath8be+p elastic data from ref .",
    "@xcite , and are inconsistent with few - body reaction theory .",
    "we will re - examine the elastic scattering of @xmath17be+p to see if one can consistently describe both sets of data using the same interaction for @xmath8be+p , by including continuum and core excitation .",
    "in addition to elastic and inelastic measurements , breakup data from nscl exist at 63.7 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "this breakup data is integrated into two wide energy bins due to statistics .",
    "the lower energy bin covers the 1.78 mev resonance and a reasonable angular distribution is obtained , which underpredicts the cross section @xcite .",
    "the higher energy bin covers resonances that are thought to be built on excited core states .",
    "the calculations presented in ref .",
    "@xcite failed to reproduce the shape of this higher energy bin , and the authors suggest that the source of the disagreement may be due to an active core during the reaction . now",
    "that it is possible to include core excitation in the reaction mechanism @xcite we will re - examine the breakup data using a consistent @xmath8be+p interaction , and including systematically the coupling to the @xmath18 state in @xmath8be .",
    "transfer reactions have also been performed with the @xmath0be beam , at 35.3 mev / u in ganil @xcite with the aim of extracting spectroscopic factors for the ground state . while the reaction mechanisms proved to be more complicated than the 1-step dwba theory",
    ", results for ( p , d ) show evidence for a significant core excited component .",
    "the inverse reaction , @xmath8be(d , p)@xmath0be , has also been studied in ganil @xcite , the main interest being the resonance structure of @xmath0be .",
    "this illustrates how transfer is being used beyond the standard application of spectroscopy of bound states , underlining the need to better understand the transfer mechanism and its coupling to the continuum .",
    "all these different data offer a good testing ground for theory .",
    "a comprehensive theoretical study @xcite focusing on @xmath8be(d , p ) show inconsistencies of the extracted spectroscopic factors for data at different energies .",
    "optical potential uncertainties and core excitation effects could be at the heart of the problem .    in this work",
    "we perform calculations including elastic , inelastic , and breakup channels of @xmath0be on protons at intermediate energies .",
    "we explore explicitly the effect of the inclusion of core excitation in the reaction mechanism .",
    "comparison to elastic and breakup data will be presented here .",
    "the analysis of the inelastic channel is presented in @xcite and we leave a detailed study of the transfer channel for a future publication . in section [ details ]",
    "we provide the details of the calculations . in section [ results ]",
    "we present the results : first for the elastic channel ( [ results : el ] ) , then for the breakup ( [ results : bu ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we draw our conclusions and provide an outlook into the future .",
    "the calculations for breakup of loosely bound systems on protons have a rather different convergence requirement as compared to the breakup on heavier systems .",
    "the model space needs to span large excitation energies , while the radial dependence can be reduced significantly .    for the cdcc calculations at 40 mev / nucleon ,",
    "the continuum was discretized upto 35 mev , with 10 bins upto 10 mev for @xmath19- , @xmath20- , and @xmath21-waves , and 8 bins from 1035 mev .",
    "we include 12 bins from 035 mev for all other partial waves up to @xmath22 .",
    "the same binning scheme was used for the xcdcc calculations , except that the higher bin density upto 10 mev was only used for channels with outgoing ground state core components .",
    "partial waves up to @xmath22 were used for the coupled channels projectile states .    for the 60 mev / nucleon cdcc calculations , a slightly different binning scheme was adopted to match the experimental energy bin integrations . from 00.5 mev",
    ", 2 bins were used ; over the observed energy bins from 0.53.0 and 3.05.5 mev , 3 bins were used in each case ; and from 5.530 mev , 6 bins . for the xcdcc calculations where the outgoing channel had excited core states ,",
    "only 1 bin was used from 00.5 mev , 1 bin for each observed energy range , and 5 bins above .",
    "the radial integrals for the bins were calculated upto 40 fm in steps of 0.1 fm .",
    "the radial equations in the cdcc method were calculated for 30 partial waves with the lower radial cutoff for the integrals set to 4 fm inside the point coulomb radius , and matched to the asymptotic coulomb functions at 150 fm .",

    "calculations were repeated for a higher energy , around 60 mev / nucleon , where both @xmath8be and @xmath0be elastic data exist . once again , when the @xmath8be data is fitted with an optical model , and the @xmath0be elastic is described within the cdcc approach , the cross section is over - estimated ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : be - el-60 ] ) . note that the data at this energy does not span a large angular range , but it is evident that the pattern of over - predicting the @xmath0be cross section remains .",
    "other reaction calculations have been performed in an effort to describe this data @xcite , which consisted of a transfer to the continuum approach in which the breakup continuum was described using the deuteron basis .",
    "this also failed to describe the data when the @xmath8be potential was fixed to the elastic data . the same pattern of overpredicting the @xmath0be elastic was also seen at a lower energy of @xmath2540 mev / nucleon @xcite .",
    "as pointed out earlier , in @xcite large renormalization factors were needed to reproduce the elastic cross section . by including more relevant reaction channels ,",
    "one might account for a part of the renormalization required , corresponding to flux that is being removed from the elastic channel .",
    "this suggests that there are still channels coupled to the elastic that have not been considered .",
    "preliminary calculations including the deuteron transfer channel along with the breakup in the @xmath0be basis show improvement at small angles , but the disagreement still remains at large angles . due to large non - orthonality corrections ,",

    "@xcite , cdcc results were presented which underestimated the cross section for the lower energy bin , but did not reproduce the higher energy bin . it was suggested that since the higher energy bin spanned a resonance with a possible excited core component , the disagreement could be due to the spectator core approximation in the standard cdcc theory . since xcdcc can handle excited core components , this data is re - examined .",

    "[ fig : be11-bin2 ] , core excitation lowers the cross section but does not significantly change the shape of the distribution .",
    "it becomes clear that core excitation does not help to reproduce the shape of the higher energy angular distribution .",
    "the main reason for this is that for the @xmath0be coupled channel model of @xcite , most of the breakup ends up in the @xmath8be ground state .",

    "the reason for this maybe that the large number of resonances in this region are not reproduced well by our particle - rotor model for @xmath0be .",
    "the only resonance that appears in this model is the @xmath29 , for which the width is not narrow enough to attract significant cross section .",

    "an optical model approach , based on a cluster folding potential constructed from the @xmath8be+p potential fitted to the appropriate elastic data , is unable to describe the @xmath0be elastic data .",
    "the inclusion of breakup effects improve the description , but theoretical predictions still overestimate the elastic cross section at larger scattering angles",
    ". the inclusion of core excitation does not affect the elastic distribution significantly .",
    "note however that these results include no artificial renormalization of the optical potential .",
    "elastic scattering experiments with radioactive beams at large facilities have repeatedly been undermined .",
    "the fact that the best reaction models are still unable to fully describe the mechanisms for the @xmath0be case , shows the need for a more varied and better elastic scattering experimental program .    in this work we also study the breakup channel explicitly .",
    "core excitation in the description of the continuum , within xcdcc , produces a slight modification of the distribution .",
    "these breakup calculations are compared to the data at @xmath30 mev / nucleon , for two energy bins 0.53.0 mev and 3.05.5 mev .",
    "for the lower energy bin , the shape of the angular distribution is well reproduced by the models .",
    "the same can not be said for the higher energy bin .",
    "the xcdcc calculations predict breakup states to specific states of the core @xmath8be .",
    "this level of detail is still not available in the data , but it could be helpful information , even at an integrated level , to identify possible causes for the remaining disagreement with the data .",
    "another important point is related to the basis used to describe the breakup states . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , within cdcc , one can describe the three body final state continuum @xmath8be+n+p in the @xmath0be continuum basis or in the deuteron continuum basis . in this work we used the @xmath0be basis .",
    "work in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that in practice the two choices do not provide the same result .",
