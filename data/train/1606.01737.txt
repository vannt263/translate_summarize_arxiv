    "the goal of this work is to develop a new optimization algorithm that can construct arbitrary nanophotonic structures from desired scattering parameters .",
    "nanophotonics is the study of the interaction of electromagnetic waves with structures that have feature sizes equal or smaller than the wavelength of the waves .",
    "examples are photonic crystals ( structured on the wavelength scale ) , metamaterials ( subwavelength structured media with new optical properties that are not available from natural materials ) and plasmonic devices ( exploiting collective excitations in metals that result in strong field enhancement ) @xcite .    in this paper , we present a nonparametric optimization algorithm that can find inner structure of the domain with arbitrary geometry . to do that we apply an adaptive finite element method of @xcite with iterative choice of the regularization parameter @xcite .",
    "we illustrate the efficiency of the proposed adaptive optimization method on the solution of the hyperbolic coefficient inverse problem ( cip ) in two dimensions .",
    "the goal of our numerical simulations is to reconstruct the permittivity function of the hyperbolic equation from single observations of the transmitted and backscattered solution of this equation in space and time .",
    "for computational solution of this inverse problem we use the domain decomposition method of @xcite . to solve our cip",
    "we minimize the corresponding tikhonov functional via lagrangian approach .",
    "this approach is similar to the one applied recently in @xcite for the solution of different hyperbolic cips : we find optimality conditions which express stationarity of the lagrangian , involving the solution of state and adjoint equations together with an equation expressing that the gradient of the lagrangian with respect to the permittivity function vanishes .",
    "then we construct an adaptive conjugate gradient algorithm and compute the unknown permittivity function in an iterative process by solving in every step the state and adjoint hyperbolic equations and updating in this way the desired permittivity function .",
    "let @xmath0 denotes a point in @xmath1 in an unbounded domain @xmath2 . in this work we consider the propagation of electromagnetic waves in two dimensions with a field polarization .",
    "thus , we model the wave propagation by the following cauchy problem for the scalar wave equation : @xmath3 here , @xmath4 is the electric field generated by the plane wave @xmath5 which is incident at @xmath6 and propagates along @xmath7 axis , @xmath8 is the spatially distributed dielectric permittivity .",
    "we note that in this work we use the single equation ( [ modelhyb ] ) instead of the full maxwell s equations , since in @xcite was demonstrated numerically that in the similar numerical setting , as we will use in this note , other components of the electric field are negligible compared to the initialized one .",
