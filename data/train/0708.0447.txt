    ", these distinct quantum properties of the qubit are harnessed to perform certain information processing and communication tasks better than using classical means .    the dimension of the quantum system , however , need not be fixed at two .",
    "continuous variable ( i.e. , infinite dimensional ) quantum states have long been studied in quantum optics to understand squeezing and certain quantum information protocols , such as , quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography have been implemented with continuous variables @xcite .",
    "it is then natural to consider a high - dimensional discrete quantum state as the potential resource or the basic information unit in quantum information .",
    "in fact , recently , there has been much interest in the @xmath0-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) quantum state ( qudit ) for potential quantum information applications and for fundamental tests of the quantum theory @xcite .    in the quantum optical approach to quantum information , the qubit",
    "is often implemented with a certain easy - to - control two - dimensional degree of freedom of a photon , such as , polarization , path , time - of - arrival , and phase @xcite .",
    "similarly , the qudit may be implemented with a high - dimensional degree of freedom of a photon , such as , multiple paths , multiple time - bin , angular momentum states , etc .",
    "of particular importance and interest , among the photonic qudit implementation schemes , are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the qutrit and the ququart states , respectively , are implemented with a pair of photons , rather than with a single photon .    in the recent years",
    ", there have been a number of experimental demonstrations of two - qudit entangled states using the high - dimensionality of photonic angular momentum , transverse momentum - position , time - of - arrival , etc .",
    "@xcite . what is common in these seemingly different schemes is that they all utilize the inherent position - momentum or angular - momentum correlations exist between the two photons of spontaneous parametric down - conversion . as a consequence",
    ", two entangled qudits are always generated as a pair and the entanglement schemes are , in principle , not scalable to multiple qudits .    in experimental quantum information research",
    ", it is desirable to be able to prepare individual qudit states separately and to have a scheme to entangle such individual qudits in a scalable manner , when needed .",
    "this bottom - up approach to entanglement generation is more or less impossible for the qudits reported in ref .",
    "@xcite due to the physical nature of the photonic degrees of freedom used to implement the qudit .",
    "recently , we proposed a linear optical scheme for generating entangled states of two photonic ququarts in which the individual ququart state is made of a pair of photons of different frequencies @xcite . in this paper , we investigate realistic and experimentally realizable two - ququart and multi - ququart entangling schemes in which the single ququart state is based on frequency - nondegenerate two - photon polarization state of spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) @xcite .",

    "we also discuss , with examples , how the beam splitter - based two - ququart entanglement scheme can be scaled up to generate entangled states of multiple biphoton ququarts .",
    "unlike other schemes that implement qudit states on the multi - dimensional degree of freedom of a single - photon state @xcite , the ququart , a four - level quantum state , discussed in this paper is based on the two - photon polarization state of frequency - nondegenerate spdc @xcite .",
    "encoding multi - dimensional quantum states on a photon pair , rather than on a single photon , was first reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and there are a number of advantages to this approach . first , since the two - fold coincidence detection is the basic measurement for the pair photon , the scheme is less susceptible to environmental optical noises and the detector dark counts .",
    "second , the photon pair state can be prepared reliably and efficiently with the spdc process , while there is no efficient and reliable source of single - photon states at the moment @xcite .",
    "third , this two - photon approach is particularly efficient and useful for the ququart state implementation .",
    "the degree of polarization of frequency - nondegenerate two - photon polarization state of spdc is not invariant under su(2 ) transformations @xcite .",
    "therefore , all four biphoton ququart basis states can be easily accessed by a set of waveplates , i.e. , linear optically @xcite . finally , as we discussed earlier in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is possible to generate entangled states of two individual ququarts using beam splitters , such as , an ordinary 50/50 beam splitter ( bs ) , a polarization beam splitter ( pbs ) , and a dichroic beam splitter ( dbs ) .",
    "in addition , as we shall show in section [ multi ] , it is possible to generate entangled states of multiple ququarts linear optically .",
    "let us start by defining the basis states that form the biphoton ququart @xcite .",
    "for the frequency - nondegenerate two - photon polarization state of spdc , it is not difficult to realize that the two - photon polarization state must belong to the four - dimensional hilbert space and that the four orthonormal basis states can be written as , @xmath2 where subscripts @xmath3 and @xmath4 label two different wavelengths of the photons . @xmath5 and",
