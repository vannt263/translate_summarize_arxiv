    "the link between the evolution of sbhs and the hierarchical build - up of galaxies is imprinted in a number of scaling relations connecting sbh masses to the global properties of the host galaxies .",
    "the high sbh mass end of these relations has yet to be fully explored : the massive galaxies expected to host the most massive sbhs are generally at large distances , making a dynamical detection of sbhs observationally challenging .",
    "this is unfortunate , since black holes with mass in excess of @xmath7 m@xmath3 occupy an integral part in our understanding of the co - evolution of sbhs and galaxies : these are the systems that have undergone the most extensive and protracted history of merging ; moreover , they represent the local relicts of the high redshift quasars detected in optical surveys . to investigate the high - mass end of the sbh mass function",
    ", we selected three bcgs from the sample of laine et al .",
    "their large masses , luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions , as well as their having a merging history which is unmatched by galaxies in less crowded environments , make these galaxies the most promising hosts of the most massive sbhs in the local universe .",
    "following coccato et al . ( 2006 ) , a model of the gas velocity field for each galaxy is generated by assuming that the ionized - gas component is moving onto circular orbits in an infinitesimally thin disc centered at the galactic nucleus .",
    "the model is projected onto the plane of the sky for a grid of assumed inclination angles of the gaseous disk .",
    "finally , the model is brought to the observational plane by accounting for the width and location ( namely position angle and offset with respect to the disk center ) of each slit , for the point spread function of the stis instrument , and for the effects of charge bleeding between adjacent ccd pixels .",
    "the mass of the sbh is determined by finding the model parameters ( sbh mass , inclination of the gas disk , and mass - to - light ratio of the stellar component ) that produce the best match to the observed velocity curves .    for abell  1836-bcg",
    ", we derive @xmath8 m@xmath3 , the largest sbh mass to have been dynamically measured to - date .",
    "the best fit inclination angle is @xmath9 , while only an upper limit to the stellar mass - to - light ratio is found ( @xmath10 m / l@xmath11@xmath3 at @xmath5 confidence level ) . for abell  3565-bcg we determine @xmath12 m@xmath3 , with @xmath13 and @xmath14 m / l@xmath11@xmath3 ( @xmath5 confidence level ) . in the case of abell  2052-bcg we find @xmath15 m@xmath3 , following the method by sarzi et al .",

    "1 we show the location of our sbh masses determinations in the near - infrared @xmath16 relation of marconi & hunt ( 2003 ) and the @xmath17 relation , as given in ferrarese & ford ( 2005 )",
