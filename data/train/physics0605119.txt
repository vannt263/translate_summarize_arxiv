    "levy flights are a model of diffusion in which the probability of a @xmath0-length jump is `` broad '' , in that , asymptotically , @xmath1 , @xmath2 . in this case",
    "the sum @xmath3 is distributed according to a levy distribution , whereas for @xmath4 normal diffusion takes place @xcite , @xcite .",
    "interesting problems arise in the theory of levy flights when considering the statistics of the visits to the sites , such for instance the number of different sites visited during a flight @xcite , @xcite ; in this paper we consider a different , but related , problem , namely the number of times a site visited by a random flyer .",
    "suppose that a random walk takes place on a @xmath5-dimensional lattice @xmath6 , let @xmath7 be a site of @xmath6 and let @xmath8 be the probability that after @xmath9 steps the walker is at @xmath7 .",
    "the mean value of visits to the site @xmath7 after @xmath10 steps is @xcite @xmath11    since derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sola ] ) does not depend on the specific form of the walk @xcite , it holds also for levy flights . in the following",
    "it will be assumed @xmath12 ; the asymptotic value of @xmath13 , denoted by @xmath14 , is defined as @xmath15 .",
    "it is known @xcite that a random walk is transient if and only if @xmath16 ; in other words the existence of finite @xmath14 implies that the walk is transient .",
    "levy flights have a wide range of applications ( see for instance @xcite and references therein ) and , in particular , analysis of the number of times a site is visited can be relevant in those processes , such as random searches , in which it is important not just to determine what sites have been visited but how often they have been visited ; examples of possible applications range from animal foraging @xcite to exploration of visual space @xcite . moreover @xmath17 can be given the following interpretation , useful for possible applications : assume that particles undergoing a levy flight are continuously generated at the origin , then , at time @xmath10 , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the mean number of particles at site @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this property of @xmath13 has been used , in a model based on electrons brownian motion , to simulate distributions of emissivity of supernova remnants @xcite .",
    "consider first one - dimensional , infinite lattices ; the probability of occupancy of site @xmath21 after @xmath9 steps is @xcite @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the probability of having a displacement of @xmath24 sites . in case of symmetric levy flights the canonical representation of @xmath25 and @xmath26 are @xcite , @xcite    @xmath27    @xmath28    where @xmath29 and @xmath30 is a real number , which in the following will be set equal to 1 for simplicity @xcite ; a scaling relation holds between @xmath26 and @xmath25 , namely @xmath31 . if @xmath32 eqs .",
    "( [ eq : trans ] ) , ( [ eq : pro1 ] ) yield the gaussian distribution @xcite , @xcite , whereas , if @xmath33 , @xmath34 fails to be a proper distribution not concentrated at a point @xcite ; therefore representations ( [ eq : trans ] ) , ( [ eq : pro1 ] ) are valid only in the interval @xmath35 .",
    "more recently it has been shown that the analytic forms of @xmath25 and @xmath26 can be given through a fox function @xcite .",
    "application of ( [ eq : sola ] ) and of the scaling relation leads to @xmath36 , and in particular , recalling that @xmath37 @xcite ,    @xmath38    with @xmath39 converging to a finite value for @xmath40 if and only if @xmath41 @xcite ; in this case @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the well known riemann zeta function @xcite .",
    "( [ eq : zeta ] ) and ( [ eq : bizeta ] ) , show that the visit to site @xmath44 is a transient state if and only if @xmath45 .",
    "the trend of @xmath46 as @xmath10 increases can be computed by making use of the formulas related to the zeta function @xcite ; for @xmath47 the result is    @xmath48}{z^{\\frac{1}{\\alpha}+1}}dz \\right ) ,   \\label{eq : intor}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath49 $ ] is the integer part of @xmath50 .",
    "application of standard summation formulas @xcite shows that , if @xmath51 , @xmath46 grows logarithmically , whereas , if @xmath52 ,    @xmath53    as @xmath40 ; finally in case of classical random walk ( @xmath4 ) , @xmath54 @xcite . since flights are symmetric and start from @xmath55 , @xmath56 is , for every @xmath9 , an even function with a maximum in @xmath55 @xcite and hence @xmath57 , for every @xmath10 and for every @xmath58 ; therefore , if @xmath41 , @xmath59 .",
    "a series expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eq : pro1 ] ) shows that @xmath60    now for every @xmath61 and every @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is finite .",
    "then @xmath65 , that is the last term on the rhs of ( [ eq : ratio ] ) just takes into account the delay with which the flyer reaches site @xmath21 ; in particular , if @xmath66 , @xmath46 diverges and @xmath67 . in conclusion ,",
    "a one - dimensional flight is transient if and only if @xmath41 , a result which has been obtained in a somehow more complex way in @xcite .",
    "consider now a @xmath5-dimensional lattice , with @xmath68 , and assume the probabilities along the different coordinates to be independent ; then eq . ( [ eq : zeta ] ) becomes @xmath69 .",
    "note that , for @xmath29 and @xmath68 , the condition @xmath70 holds and hence @xmath71 is finite ; @xmath72 as a function of @xmath10 can be computed by using a method similar the one - dimensional case , and the result is that the trend is given by @xmath73 .",
    "finally it should be observed that the results for @xmath74 , @xmath58 , obtained above , can be extended in a straightforward way to multidimensional lattices .",
    "thus levy flights on lattices of dimensions higher than one are always transient ; if @xmath4 , @xmath75 and , if @xmath76 , @xmath72 converges to a finite value @xcite , and the walk is transient @xcite .",
    "note that , when @xmath77 , @xmath46 has the same trend of @xmath78 in the gaussian regime , an instance of levy flights increasing the effective dimension of the walk @xcite .",
    "in case of flights on a bounded set it is obvious that for reflecting boundaries @xmath13 diverges as @xmath10 increases , since asymptotically @xmath79 , where @xmath80 is the number of sites @xcite , whereas if boundaries are absorbing @xmath14 exists ; here we shall consider just the case of one - dimensional lattices with absorbing boundaries .",
    "the map @xmath81 can be computed by means of numerical or analytical methods .",
    "in fact , eq . ( [ eq : conv ] ) can be seen as a recursive method to compute @xmath26 and application of ( [ eq : sola ] ) provides the result ; alternatively , one can use the diffusion approximation to derive an analytical formula .",
    "both methods have been used here and their results have been compared with @xmath82 , the `` experimental '' number of visits generated by a monte carlo simulation .    in a closed interval",
    "@xmath83 $ ] eq . ( [ eq : conv ] ) becomes @xmath84    here , for reason of simplicity , instead of ( [ eq : trans ] ) , we have used the transition probability , defined on integers @xmath24 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 , @xmath87 being a normalising constant .",
    "a similar form of @xmath25 has been used in a work on the average time spent by flights in a closed interval @xcite . in case of numerical calculations , obviously , the absolute length @xmath88 of a step must be truncated to some finite value : here @xmath89 , to allow flights to encompass the whole interval , and consequently @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : genlev ] ) provides a valid transition probability for any @xmath92 and hence it can be used to model also classical brownian motion ; for @xmath93 the process becomes the simple symmetric walk .",
    "note that by combining ( [ eq : conv ] ) and ( [ eq : sola ] ) a recursive formula for @xmath94 can be derived , namely @xmath95 ; however the separate use of ( [ eq : conv ] ) and ( [ eq : sola ] ) is to be preferred , in that it also yields values of the probability distribution and this is useful to check the correctness of the results .    in the classical theory of random",
    "walk the diffusion approximation allows to replace @xmath96 with the pdf @xmath97 , solution of the diffusion equation @xcite ; analogously for levy flights a superdiffusion equation can be derived ( see , among others , @xcite @xcite , @xcite ) , whose solution is a series of eigenfunctions @xmath98 of the operator @xmath99 @xcite . setting @xmath100 ,",
    "the pdf is @xmath101 .",
    "define , in analogy with the discrete case , @xmath102    then @xmath103 where @xmath104 are the eigenvalues of @xmath99 ; obviously , @xmath105 , for all @xmath9 , and the asymptotic formula is @xmath106 .    in @xcite",
    "a solution @xmath97 of the superdiffusion equation has been presented that , for symmetric flights , is @xmath107 \\nonumber \\\\ & \\times &   \\sin\\left ( \\frac{m\\pi(x+a)}{l } \\right ) \\sin\\left ( \\frac{m\\pi a}{l}\\right),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath108 is the length of the interval and @xmath109 the diffusion coefficient ; application of eq .",
    "( [ eq : contin ] ) to ( [ eq : pgitt ] ) , with @xmath110 , provides an explicit form for @xmath111 ,    @xmath112    calculations of @xmath111 from eq.([eq : final ] ) need the numerical value of the diffusion coefficient @xmath113 , and it can be derived from the average time @xmath114 a flyer spends in the interval , related to @xmath113 by the formula @xcite @xmath115    since @xmath114 is defined as @xmath116 the approximation @xmath117 can be used to obtain the numerical value of @xmath109 .",
    "figures ( [ theo_simu_0_3 ] ) and ( [ theo_simu_2 ] ) show @xmath118 for @xmath119 and @xmath120 respectively . it can be seen that the graph of @xmath121 tends to a triangular shape as @xmath122 increases",
    "; indeed for simple symmetric random walk , ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 ) @xmath125 @xcite .    figure ( [ max_3 ] ) presents the graph of @xmath126 as a function of @xmath122 ; note that the inflection point of the curve occurs at @xmath32 , that is at the boundary between levy flights and classical random walks .",
    "in other words , @xmath126 shows a `` phase transition '' from levy flights , characterised by small number of visits , to the gaussian regime where visits are more frequent .",
    "the results of this note clarify how the mean number of times a site is visited by a random flyer depends on the dimensionality of the lattice , the value of @xmath122 and the boundary conditions .",
    "in particular , it has been shown that unrestricted levy flights are always transient , but for the unidimensional case with @xmath127 ; restricted flights are transient if the boundaries are absorbing . in the last case computations show that the direct numerical method agrees very closely with `` experimental data '' generated by the monte carlo simulation , whereas the agreement is worse for eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) , especially when @xmath122 is small ( see figs .  [ theo_simu_0_3 ] and  [ max_3 ] ) ; this is not surprising , since eq .",
    "( [ eq : lconv ] ) deals directly with discrete variables , whereas eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) results from the diffusion approximation . on the other hand , obviously , eq .",
    "( [ eq : final ] ) provides a more general , analytical formula for @xmath128 and not just a set numerical values .",
