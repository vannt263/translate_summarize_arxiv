    "on the basis of its active participation in numerous chemical processes , water should be regarded as an exceptionally chemical liquid .",
    "water is also the most important liquid from the standpoint of understanding life processes ; the water molecule is in fact the most important bio - molecule . for such reasons ,",
    "the molecular theory of aqueous solutions is a distinct category of the study of solutions .",
    "higher detail is required for a satisfactory molecular understanding than for non - aqueous solutions , and much of that further molecular detail is unavoidably chemical in nature . here",
    "we report an initial evaluation of the free energy of liquid water using quasi - chemical theory @xcite and _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) .",
    "in addition to the physical conclusions that can be based upon the observations from the physically motivated quasi - chemical theory , the present results should also serve as benchmarks for the burgeoning efforts applying aimd to aqueous solutions .",
    "the extant literature offers several papers on aimd simulation of water ( see @xcite , and references therein ) .",
    "some of these simulations , for example @xcite , used the car - parrinello method , whereas others , for example @xcite used a born - oppenheimer _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics procedure .",
    "our own past research efforts @xcite has focused on understanding ion - water systems and chemical reactions in aqueous systems using both the statistical mechanical quasi - chemical theory of solutions and a born - oppenheimer aimd approach .",
    "these works invariably differ in methodological detail but have in common severe limitations of time and length scales that are treated .",
    "there is indeed a wide - spread , but undocumented , view that the aimd calculations typically describe unsatisfactorily ` glassy ' water at conventional liquid thermodynamic state points .",
    "thus , independent benchmark efforts should be zealously encouraged .    in all of the early aimd works that considered pure water ,",
    "the questions have largely centered on understanding the structure and bonding in liquid water ( for example , @xcite ) .",
    "quantities often considered are the radial density distribution and the self - diffusion coefficient of liquid water . though important , these are primitive quantities , and even so comparisons amongst available results have been inconsistent .",
    "different groups appear to use somewhat different analysis procedures , not always documented , and even among groups using the same procedure there are quantitative differences in g@xmath0(r ) s , the oxygen - oxygen radial distribution .",
    "izvekov and voth@xcite noted this point and helpfully explored the relevant details that went into their calculation of the g@xmath0(r ) and oxygen mean - squared displacement .",
    "quantitative comparisons of properties such as self - diffusion coefficients could be more instructive .",
    "we are unaware of a previous attempt to obtain an entropic thermodynamic property such as the chemical potential on the basis of information from aimd simulations on water .",
    "this is ironic because the unusual beauty of water as a molecular fluid is founded on its peculiar temperature behavior .",
    "the phase behavior of water on the surface of the earth has been well documented ; for example , the equilibrium densities of the liquid and vapor phases along the saturation curve are known to a far greater percision than , for instance , the height of the first peak in the g@xmath0(r ) .",
    "chemical potentials ( gibbs free energies per mole for a one - component system ) provide a more basic description of that phase equilibrium .",
    "these free energies are interesting in their own right , as a characterization of the molecular interactions , and they play a critical role in aqueous phase chemical reactions . the obvious reason that they havent been evaluated from aimd work before is that they are less trivial to calculate .",
    "an important motivation of the present work is that molecular theory , the quasi - chemical approach , has progressed to the state that sensible estimates of chemical potentials can now be obtained from aimd calculations .    in this paper",
    ", we calculate the gibbs free energy of water on the basis of aimd simulations . to our knowledge",
    "this is the first such attempt . to achieve this",
    ", we interpret the results of the aimd simulation within the framework of the statistical mechanical quasi - chemical theory of solutions .",
    "we first sketch this theory and then discuss its applications to the present case .",
    "the quasi - chemical theory is founded on describing the solute - solvent interaction by partitioning the system into a inner sphere region and an outer sphere region @xcite .",
    "this partitioning permits treatment of the chemically important interactions within the inner - sphere in detail while exploiting a simpler model to describe the interaction of inner sphere material with the rest of the system .",
    "a variational check is available to confirm the appropriateness of the partitioning @xcite , and we will reconsider this point below on the basis of the present data .    consider a distinguished water molecule , and define a inner sphere or bonding region or observation volume proximal to that chosen water molecule . here that bonding region is defined simply as a ball centered on the oxygen atom of the h@xmath8o molecule , and different values of the radius of the ball will be considered .",
    "the excess chemical potential , the hydration free energy , of the distinguished molecule can be written as : @xmath9 here @xmath10 is the indicator function for the event that the inner shell region is unoccupied .",
    "the second term of this equation is the outer - sphere contribution to the excess chemical potential .",
    "@xmath11 is the decoupled averaging associated with the potential distribution theorem @xcite .",
    "thus the outer sphere contribution would provide the hydration free energy for the case that the interactions of the distinguished molecule were altered to prohibit any occupancy of the defined inner shell by any solvent molecule .",
    "the probability that the observation volume centered on a distinguished water molecule has @xmath3 occupants is @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath1 corresponds to the case when this observation volume is empty .",
    "the interactions of the distinguished water molecule with the rest of the solution are fully involved .",
    "in contrast , the outer sphere contribution would provide the excess chemical potential ( hydration free energy ) for the defined case that the distinguished water molecule was forbidden inner shell partners .",
    "we will estimate that contribution on the basis of a van  der  waals model : a cavity free energy -@xmath12 plus mean - field estimates of contributions from longer ranged interactions .",
    "our strategy here is to estimate @xmath1 and @xmath4 from the aimd results and then to model the remaining outer sphere effects , using distinct but generally available information .    for a given choice of the observation volume , direct observation of @xmath1 from aimd simulation would be ambitious .",
    "less ambitious is to infer @xmath1 from aimd simulation results for moments that constrain the distribution @xmath2 .",
    "robust estimates of the moments @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be obtained from aimd simulations . utilizing a default distribution @xmath15 , we then consider a model incorporating lagrange multipliers @xmath16 @xmath17 in which the @xmath18 are adjusted to conform to the constraints of the available moments .",
    "such an information theory procedure has been used before to model hydrophobic hydration @xcite and also the case of na@xmath19 hydration @xcite .",
    "determination of the lagrange multiplers might be accomplished by a newton - raphson procedure ( for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the solution can be obtained by minimizing @xmath20 with @xmath21 so that @xmath22 operationally we find that eq .",

    "the outer sphere contributions will be partitioned into packing effects , electrostatic , and dispersion interactions . for a defined observation volume of radius @xmath23 ,",
    "the packing contribution was obtained as follows .",
    "10000 points were placed randomly in the simulation box per configuration , and the population of water molecules in the defined volume calculated .",
    "these give the quantities @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath4 was then readily obtained by the information theory procedure .",

    "the spc / e@xcite charge set was used for the water molecule in the center of the cavity . for the dispersion contribution",
    ", we assume that the solute - solvent ( outside the observation volume ) interaction is of the form @xmath25 and that the distribution of water outside the observation volume is uniform .",
    "thus the dispersion contribution is @xmath26 , where for the spc / e water model , @xmath27 is @xmath28  kcal / mole  @xmath29 .",
    "the _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics ( aimd ) simulations were carried out with the vasp @xcite simulation program using a generalized gradient approximation , pw91 , @xcite to the electron density functional theory .",

    "the system is 32 water molecules contained in a cubic box of length 9.8656   .",
    "the 32 molecule system was extracted from a well - equilibrated classical molecular dynamics simulation of spc / e @xcite water molecules .",
    "this was further energy minimized and then equilibrated ( at 300  k ) by periodic velocity scaling using the spc / e potential for more than 20  ps . the hydrogen atoms were replaced by deuterium atoms in the _ ab initio _ simulation ; hence our _ ab initio _",

    "the pbe run lasted about 6.3  ps , of which the last 3.6  ps comprised the production phase .",
    "the rpbe run lasted 7.6  ps of which the last 3.4  ps comprised the production phase .",

    "consistent with experiments , the first shell around the distinguished water has four ( 4 ) water molecules .",
    "this contrasts with classical water models where typically between 4 to 6 water molecules are found in the first shell . in comparison to the experiments ,",
    "both the pw91 and pbe simulations indicate structuring of the fluid , whereas the rpbe simulation predicts a less structured fluid .",
    "( note also the differences in temperature between the experiments and the simulations ) .",
    "nuclear quantum effects will likely soften the computed structures as was suggested by kuharski and rossky @xcite .    to estimate the effect of timestep",
    ", we further propagated the rpbe run for another 4.4  ps with a timestep of 0.5  ps . initial velocities were assigned to give a temperature of 300  k. the mean temperature in the last 1.5  ps of this run was 298@xmath3520  k. the g@xmath0(r ) for this run is indistinguishable from the g@xmath0(r ) for rpbe shown in fig .",

    "but since these effects go in opposite directions , they tend to balance out .    for a classical water model , paliwal and paulaitis ( personal communication ) have computed the sum of chemical and packing effects without recourse to the information theory approach , but relying on about 50  ns of simulation instead .",

    "the distinguishing aspect here is _ not _ in the agreement for the net sum , especially considering our slightly higher temperature ( and hence a higher density ) than their simulations at 298  k. the distinguishing aspect here is : _ the inner - sphere chemical effects very nearly balance the outer - sphere packing effects_.    for the outer - sphere electrostatic and dispersion contribution , paliwal and paulaitis have explicitly evaluated the second term of eq .",

    "the rpbe functional predicts@xcite @xmath59  kcal / mole .",
    "thus the rpbe functional is substantially weakening the intra - molecular bonds in water and this clearly lies at the heart of why this functional softens the @xmath60(r ) of liquid water and why pbe and pw91 sharpen the structure .",
    "the same physical effect likely also leads to a drop in the temperature for the rpbe functional .",
    "likewise the blyp functional yields an atomization energy around 230  kcal / mole .",
    "once again it is the weakening of intra - molecular bonds that likely leads to this functional softening the structure of liquid water in comparison to the pw91 and pbe functionals .",
    "note a caveat when comparison between our pw91/pbe results is being made with earlier results with blyp .",
    "the blyp results were from cpmd simulations , and as already indicated , published results from different groups @xcite do not agree between themselves .",

    "perdew and coworkers have noted the  procrustean \" @xcite feature of rpbe that it weakens the intra - molecular bonds in an isolated water molecule .",
    "the same situation applies to blyp .",
    "although this helps describe liquid water better , it could come at the price of describing local chemical effects realistically .",
    "this is of immense concern when studying chemical reactions in liquid water in which water itself is a participant .",
    "such a case arises in the study of an excess proton or proton - hole @xcite in liquid water .",
    "both the pw91 and pbe functionals under - estimate the proton affinity of ho@xmath61 by 2  kcal / mole , whereas the blyp functional under - estimates this value by about 5  kcal / mole .",
    "the rpbe functional is also expected to substantially under - estimate this proton affinity .",
    "resolution of this conundrum will have to await a next level of development of electronic density functionals .",
    "in this paper we obtain the hydration free energy of water using _ ab initio _ molecular dynamics simulation in conjuction with the quasi - chemical theory of solutions .",
    "our approach requires determination of a coordination number distribution @xmath38 , the fraction of molecules with @xmath3 inner shell neighbors .",

    "the quasi - chemical theory identified an inner sphere radius of 3.3  where the resulting free energy is insensitive to slight adjustments of that inner sphere region .",
    "this is physically consistent with radius of the first minimum in g@xmath0(r ) .",
    "the chemical and packing contributions provide nearly cancelling contributions to the hydration of water , the net sum being @xmath45  kcal / mole . including outer - sphere dispersion and electrostatic effects yields a final value of @xmath6  kcal / mole in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of @xmath7  kcal / mole at 314  k.",
    "an important physical conclusion is that the quasi - chemical approach @xcite provides a natural description of the statistical thermodynamics of liquid water . in this analysis ,",
