    "the kinetics of phase separation of a disordered system quenched into a multiphase coexistence region has been extensively studied in the last years @xcite .",
    "the main features of the process are well understood : after an early stage during which ordered domains of the equilibrium phases are formed the segregation proceeds in the late stage by coarsening of ordered regions according to the power law growth @xmath10 for the average domains size . in binary liquids , the existence of several regimes characterized by different exponents @xmath11 , due to the presence of various growth mechanisms , is well established @xcite . in these regimes",
    "the pair correlation function @xmath12 verifies a dynamical scaling law according to which it can be written as @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a scaling function @xcite .",
    "> from the theoretical point of view the most relevant progresses have been achieved in the framework of the continuous approach based on the cahn - hilliard equation with a ginzburg - landau free energy functional , the time dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model . within this approach , which neglects hydrodynamics ,",
    "the properties of the phase - separation kinetics can be efficiently studied by means of numerical simulations or analytically in the context of approximate theories , among which the so - called large-@xmath0 limit ( one - loop approximation ) . for a vectorial system with an infinite number of components @xmath0 , indeed , the tdgl model is exactly soluble . the one - loop approximation is known to provide a mean - field picture of the phase - separation process which captures the essence of the phenomenon at a semi - quantitative level @xcite .    in this paper we study the process of phase separation in a binary mixture subject to an uniform shear flow . when shear is applied to the system the time evolution is substantially different from that of ordinary spinodal decomposition .",
    "we consider both a stationary flow and an oscillating shear .",
    "a stationary flow induces strong deformations of the domains formed after the quench @xcite , which become anisotropic and stretched along the flow direction .",
    "consequently the growth rate along the flow is larger than in the other directions . in some experiments",
    "a power law increase of the typical size of the domains is observed and a value @xmath15 in the range @xmath16 for the difference between the exponents in the flow and in the shear directions is reported @xcite .",
    "two dimensional molecular dynamic simulations find a slightly smaller value @xcite .",
    "in other experimental realizations , when the shear is strong enough , stringlike domains have been observed to extend macroscopically in the direction of the flow @xcite preventing complete phase separation . in general , the scaling behavior of sheared systems is not clearly understood and the very existence of a scaling regime in different experimental systems is questionable .    in a previous paper @xcite",
    "we have shown that the numerical solution of the one - loop approximation to the tdgl model for phase separation under shear exhibits a generalized scaling symmetry characterized by @xmath17 . in the scaling regime the structure factor and other observables exhibit the interesting feature of an oscillatory pattern which can be related to a mechanism of storing and dissipation of elastic energy where domains are stretched and broken cyclically .",
    "this new effect has been shown to persist up to the longest available time of our computation and represents the hallmark of a complex dynamical pattern induced by the presence of the shear . in a recent paper rapapa and bray @xcite , by solving asymptotically the one - loop equations , confirmed analytically the existence of a ( multi)-scaling symmetry ; in the long time limit , however , they do not recover the cyclical pattern described insofar and they infer that the observed oscillations are slowly - decaying preasymptotic transients. since their solution is obtained in the infinite time limit , then , a reference theory for the description of this remarkable phenomenon is lacking .",
    "given that the one - loop approximation is a mean - field solution in spirit the natural question of its accuracy for the description of the original model arises .",
    "a numerical analysis of the exact tdgl model has been performed recently in @xcite where it is shown that the global picture of the one - loop approximation is adequate .",
    "in particular the oscillatory pattern is recovered .",
    "the existence of a scaling symmetry and the determination of the related exponents , however , has not been clearly established numerically mainly due to finite size effects limitations .",
    "the actual value of the growth exponents can be inferred by scaling @xcite or renormalization group @xcite arguments to be @xmath18 , as in the case without shear ( we stress the fact that hydrodynamic effects are neglected in this model ) , and @xmath19 .",
    "the shear also induces a peculiar rheological behavior .",
    "the break - up of the stretched domains liberates an energy which gives rise to an increase @xmath8 of the viscosity @xcite .",
    "experiments and simulations show that the excess viscosity @xmath8 reaches a maximum at @xmath20 and then relaxes to smaller values .",
    "the maximum of the excess viscosity is expected to occur at a fixed @xmath21 and to scale as @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "simple scaling arguments predict @xmath23 @xcite , but different values have been reported @xcite .",
    "all these features are adequately described by the tdgl already at the one - loop level .    in this paper",
    "we present a complete scenario of the behavior of the tdgl model for phase separation in a shear flow in the framework of the large-@xmath0 approximation .",
    "the behavior of the system is studied along the whole time history , from the instant of the quench onward , both in the presence of a steady flow and in the case of an oscillating shear where interesting effects are undercovered .",

    "it is important to stress the fact that the presence of four peaks in the structure factor is exhibited already at the linear theory level of approximation .",

    "later on , however , the linear theory fails because the non - linearities become relevant , and the long - time regime is entered .",
    "this is characterized by the shrinking of the support of @xmath49 towards the origin with different rates for the shear and the flow directions so that the tilt angle , namely the direction along which @xmath87 is aligned , decreases in time .",

    "> from the computed values of @xmath182 and @xmath168 we estimated the phase angle @xmath188 , which , according to eqs .",
    "( [ phase ] ) and ( [ shstress ] ) , is given by @xmath189 . in fig .",
    "( [ fig_m ] ) we report the time evolution of @xmath188 as a function of @xmath183 .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath188 decreases with time to reach an asymptotic value which is approximately 0.016 .",
    "accordingly , the system we are investigating shows in the asymptotic stage a behavior which is essentially elastic . the experimental data of @xcite confirm this behavior .",
    "in this paper we have studied the kinetics of a phase - separating binary fluid , in the presence of a shear flow , by means of the tdgl model .",
    "it is nowadays well established that the corresponding model with @xmath67 accurately describes the main features of the segregation process in binary alloys , where hydrodynamics can be neglected . in viscous fluids , such as polymeric blends ,",
    "the validity of the present approach is limited to the early stage of spinodal decomposition ; for longer times one should consider the full hydrodynamic description @xcite .    when the shear is applied to a fluid the behavior of the system is profoundly changed under many respects and a general agreement on the predictivness of the proposed models is matter of general debate .",
    "a discussion on possible effects of hydrodynamics is presented in @xcite .",
    "moreover , the numerical solution of the tdgl model with shear poses serious problems due to discretization limitations and finite size effects and , although some progresses have been recently achieved @xcite , a satisfactory description is nowadays not available . in this scenario",
    "it is important to devise a simple analytical scheme providing the fundamental tools for the comprehension of the fluid dynamics .",
    "a natural choice in the field of growth kinetics is the large-@xmath0 approximation , that has been thoroughly studied in the case without shear , where it has proven to give a reliable description of the segregation process , although at a _ mean field _ level .    in this paper",
    "the behavior of the tdgl model in the one - loop approximation is studied in detail , and the whole time evolution of the blend is considered , from the quenching instant onward ; the cases of a stationary flow and of an oscillating shear have been examined . in doing",
    "so we undercover a very rich dynamical pattern , where not only some experimental findings are reproduced , but new predictions are allowed . after an early stage , which is accurately described by the linear theory _  la _ cahn - hilliard , the presence of the velocity field produces an anisotropic power - law growth of the characteristic lengths @xmath1 , @xmath2 respectively in the flow direction and perpendicularly to it .",
    "the value of the exponent @xmath190 in the directions perpendicular to the flow is the same as in models with vectorial conserved order parameter without shear ; although the actual value of this exponent is not expected to be accurate for real fluids ( since , even without shear , the exponent obtained at the same level of approximation is known to corresponds to the lifshitz - slyozov exponent @xmath191 for scalar fields ) a growth exponent @xmath192 unaffected by the presence of shear has been obtained also by scaling @xcite and renormalization group @xcite arguments applied to the full model equations and is also measured in experiments @xcite .",
    "moreover a difference @xmath154 between the flow and shear exponents is also expected to be obtained by releasing the present approximation @xcite and is observed in some experiments . in the case of a stationary flow",
    "the anisotropic growth governed by these exponents is observed from the onset of the scaling regime onwards .",
    "the power law behavior of any observable is decorated by log - time periodic oscillations .",
    "these oscillations characterize the scaling regime up to the longest simulated time but they are not observed in the asymptotic solution presented in @xcite . given that log - time periodicity appears to be a rather common feature being observed , besides segregating fluids , during fracturing of heterogeneous solids @xcite and in stock market indices @xcite for instance , it would then be interesting to devise an analytical approach to enlighten the origin of this new phenomenon at least in the present model .    in experiments with real fluid systems carried out by laufer et al .",
    "@xcite and , successively , by mani et al .",
    "@xcite and migler et al .",
    "double overshoot _ in the time behavior of the viscosity and of the normal stress is observed and an interpretation in terms of break - up and recombination of the domains network is proposed . on the bases of our results",
    "it is plausible that this _",
    "double overshoot _ represents the first part of a log - time periodic phenomenon which could be hopefully detected with a suitable experimental setup . in the model",
    "we have studied the oscillatory behaviour is due to the competition between the different maxima of a four - fold peaked structure factor .",
    "the presence of these maxima is interpreted is sec .",
    "iii b as due to the existence of different types of domains and the recurrent prevalence of each peak is suggested to be caused by the interplay between these kind of regions .",
    "a structure factor with four maxima has also been observed in polymer mixtures @xcite ; however to our knowledge the connection between the alternative dominance of the peaks of @xmath49 and the _ overshoots _ observed in the viscosity and in the stresses has never been discussed insofar , perhaps due to insufficient resolution , although an experimental confirmation of this hypotheses would be desirable .",
    "when an oscillating shear is present , the anisotropic regime discussed so far for the steady shear case crosses over to an isotropic growth when domains are fully developed . in this late stage , from the analysis of the behavior of the structure factor , we conjecture again the existence of two types of domains responding differently to the flow oscillations : the network of elongated structures keeps the orientation assumed during its formation in the early stage while small features generated by scission of strained parts oscillate in phase with the flow . in this late stage the growth kinetics",
    "is regulated by the same exponents as without flow .",
    "we are not aware of experiments reporting these features : it would be interesting to devise an experimental set - up for testing this prediction .",
