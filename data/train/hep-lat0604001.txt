    "the decay constants of heavy - light p - wave mesons have a number of important uses in phenomenology  @xcite . in this paper we use unquenched lattice qcd to compute the decay constants of @xmath4 heavy - light mesons , using heavy quarks with masses around that of the charm quark , and with heavy quarks in the static limit .",
    "due to heavy - quark symmetry , there are four p - wave ( @xmath5 ) heavy - light excited mesons , noted for short @xmath6 , organised in two doublets , one doublet carrying a total angular momentum @xmath7 and the other @xmath8 for the light quarks . in the charm sector , we use the notation that the scalar @xmath9 meson is @xmath10 when the light quark is an up or a down quark and @xmath11 when it is a strange quark . in the static limit of hqet ,",
    "the members of each of the two doublets are degenerate in mass .",
    "the low mass of the @xmath12 meson , recently discovered by babar  @xcite and confirmed by other experiments , relative to the quark model predictions of godfrey and isgur  @xcite was originally a puzzle .",
    "the quantum numbers of @xmath12 are consistent with @xmath13 = @xmath4 , but this needs confirmation  @xcite .",
    "there are some speculations that this state may be a molecule  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical studies to understand the @xmath12 have recently been reviewed by colangelo et al .",
    "@xcite and by swanson  @xcite .",
    "the lattice qcd results for the mass of the @xmath11 state were tantalising close ( within large errors ) to the experimental mass of the @xmath12 state  @xcite .",
    "however , the lattice calculation of the @xmath11 meson in  @xcite did not agree with the mass of the @xmath12 .",
    "as discussed by ukqcd  @xcite a hadronic state will couple to many different interpolating operators made out of quarks , anti - quarks and glue , with the same quantum numbers as the hadron . in order to say",
    "whether a hadronic state is more like a molecule or @xmath14 state , the lattice calculation needs to also determine the amplitude for a hadronic state to be in a specific configuration of quarks and anti - quarks .",
    "one possible way to determine the quark distribution of a hadronic state is to look at observables like form factors , the most basic being the decay constant .",
    "for example , in a simple picture of a molecular state , the decay constant should be suppressed relative to that of a bound state of quark and antiquark .",
    "an analysis of non - leptonic decays of the @xmath15 meson using the factorisation hypothesis suggested that the decay constant of the @xmath12 could be significantly smaller than that of the pseudo - scalar heavy - light meson  @xcite .",
    "this motivates a lattice calculation of the decay constant of the @xmath4 heavy - light meson .",
    "the @xmath16 decays are also relevant to clarify the so called ` @xmath17 vs. @xmath18 puzzle '  @xcite indeed , the heavy to heavy @xmath19 transitions , with @xmath20 , are parametrised by the generalised isgur - wise functions @xmath21 , where @xmath22 .",
    "several theoretical considerations using independent methods ( sum rules derived from qcd  @xcite , covariant quark model  @xcite , lattice qcd  @xcite , experimental data combined with naive factorisation  @xcite ) , suggest that the @xmath8 states dominate , with respect to the @xmath7 states in @xmath23 transitions , i.e. @xmath24",
    ". nevertheless this prediction is in contradiction with some of the currently available experimental data .",
    "the solution for this puzzle still requires new inputs from both theory and experiment . from the theoretical side , the determination of the decay constant",
    ", @xmath25 of the @xmath10 meson is needed to evaluate the decay width of two ( out of the three ) classes of @xmath16 decays , when naive factorisation is assumed  @xcite .",
    "a recent summary  @xcite of results for the decay constant , showed that estimates for @xmath25 lay between 122 and 417 mev .",
    "this summary also reported that the decay constant of @xmath4 heavy - light mesons in the static limit was higher than at the charm mass .",
    "this required confirmation , because the heavy quark mass dependence was obscured by model dependence .",
    "some factorisation schemes  @xcite for non - leptonic decays of @xmath15 mesons use the static limit as the leading term , hence computing the decay constant of the p - wave static - light meson is also important for this reason .",
    "the evaluation of the @xmath26 corrections to the heavy quark limit of the various quantities describing @xmath19 transitions is crucial since simple estimates tend to suggest the presence of large corrections  @xcite .",
    "there is a huge effort in lattice gauge theory that aims to compute the decay constant of the heavy - light pseudo - scalar mesons , because they are crucial for determining ckm matrix elements  @xcite .",
    "the decay constant of the heavy - light vector meson has been computed in  @xcite in order to test the hqet scaling relations .",
    "there has been no published work ( apart from a private communication reported in  @xcite ) on using lattice qcd to compute the decay constants of p - wave heavy - light mesons .",
    "the study of the wave - function of p - wave static - light mesons  @xcite , using quenched lattice qcd , did not extract a decay constant .",
    "ukqcd has studied the charge and matter radial distributions of p - wave static - light mesons  @xcite .    in our calculations",
    ", we used the non - perturbatively improved clover action with clover coefficient of 2.0171 for the light quarks . the wilson gauge action was used .",
    "the lattice volume was @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "there were two flavours of sea quarks .",
    "the @xmath29 values are tabulated with the results .",
    "the sea quark masses span from the strange quark to one third of the strange quark mass .",
    "the details of the light hadron spectroscopy can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is that in section  [ se : prop ] , we first discuss our results using clover fermions with quark masses around the charm value .",
    "next in section  [ se : static ] , we present data using static heavy quarks . in the final section  [ se : concl ]",
    "we compare our results to other determinations and make some remarks about the heavy quark mass dependence of the decay constants .",
    "we have used the unquenched data from  @xcite to study the decay constant of the @xmath4 meson around the charm mass with clover quarks .    the data set used the sea @xmath29 = 0.1350 and three valence light quark masses using @xmath29-values of 0.1340 , 0.1345 and 0.1350 .",
    "the @xmath29 values for the heavy quarks were : 0.113 , 0.119 and 0.125 . using @xmath30 = 0.5 fm ,",
    "the inverse lattice spacing is 1.88 gev  @xcite .",
    "the sea quark mass was kept fixed at the mass of the strange quark , hence this is a partially quenched calculation .",
    "the data sample included 394 gauge configurations separated by 20 trajectories .",
    "adjacent data were binned together . a smearing matrix of order two , using local and fuzzed basis states , was fitted to a factorising fit model  @xcite .",
    "the decay constant of the @xmath10 meson can be defined by equation , @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the vector current with two non - degenerate quark flavours .",
    "this uses the @xmath33 structure of the charged weak quark current and parity conservation .",
    "we used a unit gamma matrix between the heavy and light quark fields as the interpolating operator for the @xmath10 state .",
    "unfortunately , we did not measure the lattice correlators with @xmath34 at the sink and @xmath35 at the source that would be required to use equation  [ eq : vectordefn ] directly . in principle due to the number of gamma matrices",
    ", there are 256 different local meson correlators .",
    "many lattice qcd codes do not compute every possible correlator , because some correlators are zero by symmetries . the correlator with a @xmath34 at the sink and a unit matrix at",
    "the source is zero for degenerate quarks because of charge conjugation .",
    "colangelo et al .",
    "@xcite define the decay constant ( @xmath36 ) using equation  [ eq : decaydefncol ] .",
    "@xmath37 where @xmath38 is the mass of the charm quark .",
    "equation  [ eq : decaydefncol ] can be related to equation  [ eq : vectordefn ] since the divergence of the vector current for non - degenerate quarks is proportional to the scalar density .",
    "the derivation of equation  [ eq : decaydefncol ] from equation  [ eq : vectordefn ] assumes that the mass of the light quark can be neglected relative to that of the charm quark .    from a lattice qcd perspective , it is more natural to define the decay constant using equation  [ eq : decaydefn ] .",
    "@xmath39 the determination of the mass of the charm quark can have quite large systematic errors at a fixed lattice spacing  @xcite , so we prefer the definition of the decay constant with no explicit factor of the charm mass . to convert from our normalisation of the decay constant @xmath40 to that of @xmath36 , we note that for this data set ukqcd obtained @xmath41 = @xmath42 gev  @xcite , using a quark mass defined using the fermilab heavy quark formalism  @xcite .",
    "the matrix element is related to the coupling amplitude @xmath43 in the fit to the @xmath4 to @xmath4 meson correlator .",
    "@xmath44 a simple linear fit model was used to extrapolate and interpolate in the quark masses .",
    "we first interpolated to the strange quark mass  @xcite , or extrapolated to the light quark mass ( at @xmath45 ) .",
    "the decay constants were then interpolated to the value of the mass of the charm quark  @xcite .    in figure",
    "[ fig : meff ] we report an effective mass plot for the local - local and fuzzed - local correlators used in the analysis . in figure",
    "[ fig : massdependlight ] we plot the bare decay constant as a function of the bare light quark mass in physical units with mass of the heavy quark fixed .",
    "similarly , figure  [ fig : massdepend ] shows the bare lattice decay constant as a function of the heavy quark mass , with the light quark mass fixed at the mass of the strange quark .",
    "the dependence of the decay constant on the mass of the quarks is very mild .",

    "the vertical line is the estimate for the charm quark mass . ]    to convert the lattice number into the @xmath46 scheme we use tadpole improved perturbation theory to one loop order ( the required expressions are listed in  @xcite ) .    @xmath47    where @xmath48 is the fourth root of the plaquette .",
    "the mass dependent improvement factor @xmath49 was multiplied into the scalar current .",
    "we used the one loop expression for @xmath50  @xcite , @xmath51 and the same prescription for the coupling as used in ukqcd s estimate of the mass of the charm quark  @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath52 to determine @xmath53 .    in lattice units we obtain @xmath54 = 0.280(70 ) and @xmath55 = 0.270(90 ) . using @xmath30 = 0.5 fm , and @xmath53 from equation  [ eq : zstad ]",
    ", we obtain @xmath25 = 360(90 ) mev and @xmath56 = 340(110 ) mev . in principle",
    ", we should estimate the effect of the lattice spacing dependence and higher order terms in the perturbative expansion , as we did when we estimated the mass of the bottom quark  @xcite .",
    "however , because the statistical errors are of the order of 30% , the statistical errors will clearly dominate .",
    "for example , a typical estimate of the systematic error due to the different ways of determining the lattice spacing in a lattice calculation with these parameters would be to vary the value of @xmath30 between 0.5 fm and 0.55 fm .",
    "this systematic error is a 10 % effect .",
    "we now discuss the central value of @xmath30 used .",
    "when @xmath30 , a number derived from the heavy quark potential , was introduced by sommer  @xcite , he quoted a value of @xmath30 about @xmath57 fm .",
    "the value of @xmath30 can also be determined from lattice calculations .",
    "as reviewed in  @xcite , unquenched calculations with similar parameters to those used here compute a value of @xmath30 between 0.5 and 0.55 fm .",
    "the issue is not so clear because the hpqcd collaboration , using gauge configurations from the milc collaboration , obtain a value of @xmath30 = 0.469(7 ) fm . as ukqcd has argued  @xcite , for calculations with these parameters it better to use a value of @xmath30 closer to 0.5 fm because this is the value determined from similar calculations .",
    "the milc / hpqcd value for @xmath30 is with in 10% of 0.5 fm .",
    "this part of the work is a continuation of ukqcd s study of static - light mesons .",
    "the static - light meson spectrum was reported in  @xcite , and then used to extract the mass of the bottom quark  @xcite .",
    "here we use the extended data set that was used to look for chiral logs in the @xmath58 decay constant  @xcite .",
    "in addition to using the standard static action of eichten and hill , we also report data using one of the static actions developed by the alpha collaboration  @xcite with improved signal to noise ratio .",
    "the exact static actions are described in  @xcite .",
    "here we focus on the meson doublet with total light quark momentum of @xmath7 , we call this the @xmath59 static - light meson  @xcite . as corrections to the static limit",
    "are included the @xmath59 state will split into a @xmath4 state and a @xmath60 state . in this paper , the decay constant of the @xmath59 static - light meson",
    "is called @xmath61 . the @xmath61 decay constant",
    "is defined by the matrix element in equation @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the vector current  @xcite .",
    "the simple spin structure of the static quark means the same decay constant is obtained if in equation  [ eq : decaydefn ] the vector current ( with @xmath64 ) is replaced with a scalar current .",
    "the @xmath61 matrix element is extracted from the amplitudes in the two point correlator @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the interpolating operator for the @xmath59 static - light meson and ground state dominance is shown in equation  [ eq : fitmodel ] . in practise",
    "we use a basis of smearing functions to do variational smearing  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath67 amplitude is related to the @xmath61 decay constant @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a perturbative matching factor that we discuss below .",
    "this is an equivalent definition to the one used for the pseudo - scalar heavy - light decay constant ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "it is traditional to match the results of a lattice static - light calculation to continuum qcd via two steps  @xcite .",
    "qcd is matched to the continuum static theory .",
    "the lattice static theory is then matched to the static continuum theory .",
    "the matching of the static continuum theory to the static - lattice theory has been done by eichten and hill  @xcite and by borrelli and pittori  @xcite for the clover action .",
    "this matching was done for a heavy - light current with arbitrary gamma matrix ( @xmath71 ) . for the definition of the decay constant in equation  [ eq : decaydefn ] ,",
    "we do the perturbative matching assuming @xmath72 .",
    "the matching between the continuum static theory and the static lattice theory is via @xmath73 .",

    "the equivalent expression for equation  [ eq : zcontstat ] , for arbitrary @xmath71 matrix , is in  @xcite .",
    "the matching factor @xmath69 in equation is the product of @xmath86 with @xmath87 to leading order in the square of the coupling @xmath88 .",
    "the improvement coefficients have not been calculated for the p - wave decay constant and we will therefore not include them in our analysis .",
    "we used a simple boosted coupling ( @xmath89 and @xmath90 ) to compute the perturbative matching factors .",
    "we use the mass ( @xmath91 mev ) for the mass factor in equation  [ eq : zlstaticamp ] .",
    "the experimental spectrum of the p - wave b mesons is not very well determined at the moment  @xcite .",
    "lattice calculations predict that the lowest p - wave meson will be roughly 400 mev above the s - wave states .",
    "so we add 400 mev to the mass of the @xmath92 state  @xcite .",
    "this corresponds to a 4% effect on the decay constant .",
    "we prefer not to use the hqet scaling law of the decay constant to quote numbers for the decay constant of the @xmath0 charm - light meson , as is done by jugeau et al .",
    "@xcite , because it is known that @xmath93 corrections to the static limit of the decay constant of the pseudo - scalar heavy - light meson are large .",
    "the unrenormalised data for the amplitudes are in table  [ tab : staticbareresults ] .",
    "the final column shows the value for @xmath61 in the static limit in physical units .",
    "the value of @xmath30 = 0.5 fm was used to convert the data into physical units .    as the renormalisation factor for the alpha static action has not yet been determined",
    ", we ca nt use that data to quote a physical number .",
    "what is disappointing is that the alpha static action does not produce any reduction in the statistical errors over the standard eichten - hill static action in our case . for the static - light pseudo - scalar meson decay constant",
    "the statistical errors were significantly smaller for the alpha static action than the eichten - hill action  @xcite .",
    "in  @xcite it was shown that the @xmath94 data set corresponded to sea quarks with mass around the strange quark mass .",

    "further information about the lattice parameters is in  @xcite .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ zzz ]    kurth and sommer  @xcite have noted that there are potential problems with extrapolating in the heavy - quark mass unless the continuum limit has been taken .",
    "also see kronfeld  @xcite for a discussion of the problems combining static and propagating heavy - light data . given these theoretical concerns , the data is consistent with the view that the decay constant of the static - light meson is larger than that of the @xmath0 charm - light meson , if we use definition of the decay constant in equation  [ eq : vectordefn ] ( our value of @xmath96 is in table 2 ) , but the errors need to be reduced for a definitive statement .",
    "jugeau et al .",
    "have collected together a number of different calculations of the @xmath0 decay constant of a charm - light meson . to compare our results to other calculations we use the normalisation in equation  [ eq : vectordefn ] .",
    "hence we multiply our result by @xmath97 = 1.27/2.317 and compare to other calculations in table 2 .",
    "there is reasonable agreement between different determinations . to reduce the errors on the lattice results requires a calculation of similar effort to that done to compute the decay constants of the heavy - light pseudo - scalar mesons  @xcite .",
