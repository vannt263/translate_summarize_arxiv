    "<S> the momentum dependence of the empirical scalar and vector potentials needed for describing relativistic heavy - ion collisions at 1 gev / nucleon is compared with that derived from self - consistent dirac - brueckner calculations using the bonn - a potential . </S>",
    "<S> our calculated scalar and vector potentials exhibit a weak momentum dependence and their magnitudes decrease with nucleon momentum , in close similarity with the momentum dependence required by the empirical potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the effects of explicit momentum dependence on the properties of equilibrium nuclear matter are found to be small .    </S>",
    "<S> heavy - ion collisions at various energies open new frontiers and provide opportunities for nuclear physics </S>",
    "<S> . theoretical description of heavy - ion collisions is usually based on transport models . for heavy - ion collisions at beam energies from a few hundred </S>",
    "<S> mev / nucleon to a few gev / nucleon , the reaction dynamics is mainly governed by the stochastic two - body scattering and propagation in the mean - field potential . </S>",
    "<S> transport models that include both effects , such as boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck ( buu ) @xcite , quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) @xcite , and the relativistic extensions , rbuu @xcite and rqmd @xcite , have been extensively used for the description of heavy - ion collisions in this energy region .    in the buu or qmd calculations , the nucleon potential is usually parameterized in terms of skyrme - type effective interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the importance of the momentum dependence of the nucleon potential was realized when analysing nucleon flow and pion production in heavy - ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been incorporated into the buu and qmd approaches based on various phenomenological parameterizations that are constrained by the empirical information from proton - nucleus scattering experiments @xcite .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the relativistic transport models @xcite are usually based on the walecka - type effective lagrangians @xcite . in this model , nucleons feel both attractive scalar and repulsive vector potentials . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding schrdinger equivalent potential , that is to be compared with the potentials used in buu and qmd calculations , is automatically and explicitly momentum dependent . in the mean field approximation both </S>",
    "<S> the scalar and vector potentials are momentum independent . </S>",
    "<S> the schrdinger equivalent potential then increases linearly with nucleon kinetic energy , which is in disagreement with what has been learned from the dirac phenomenology analysis of proton - nucleus scattering at intermediate energies @xcite .    in a recent paper </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the explicit momentum dependence in nucleon scalar and vector potential is important for the description of nucleon flow in heavy - ion collisions at 1 gev / nucleon region @xcite . in that work , </S>",
    "<S> the momentum dependence correction was introduced by scaling the momentum independent mean field potential with a momentum dependent function extracted from the dirac phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> there have been similar attempts to reproduce the correct momentum dependence of the schrdinger equivalent potential by including explicit momentum dependence in the nucleon scalar and vector potentials @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> a main purpose of this paper is to study microscopically the origin of the momentum dependence in the scalar and vector potentials used in relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consitent dirac brueckner ( dbhf ) approach @xcite is employed . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - known that the dbhf approach reproduces nicely the nuclear matter properties starting from realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions that are constrained by the two - nucleon data . in most dbhf calculations </S>",
    "<S> the scalar and vector potentials are assumed to be momentum independent . </S>",
    "<S> this is a good approximation for equilibrium nucleon matter , where the nucleon momenta involved are not very large . </S>",
    "<S> the momentum dependence was studied by ter haar and malfliet @xcite , and they found a relatively weak momentum dependence for both the real and imaginary parts of the scalar and vector potentials . </S>",
    "<S> recently , sehn _ et al . _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite studied the momentum dependence of the nucleon scalar and vector potentials in the first - order approximation . </S>",
    "<S> they first carried out the momentum independent dbhf calculation as in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the scalar and vector potential so obtained were identified with a nucleon at fermi surface , namely @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials for momenta below and above @xmath1 were then calculated using the formalism of horowitz and serot @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the self - consistency in the dbhf calculation has thus been neglected in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will compare our results to those of refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we follow essentially the dbhf formalism of ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic quantity is the @xmath2 matrix that satisfies the in - medium thompson equation , @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 is c.m . </S>",
    "<S> momentum , @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle potential can be calculated once the @xmath2 matrix is known , @xmath8 this potential is usually parameterized in terms of scalar and vector potential , @xmath9 in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , both the scalar and vector potentials are assumed to be momentum independent . </S>",
    "<S> thus for a given density , these potentials can be determined by choosing two momenta in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) , usually @xmath10 and @xmath1 . in the momentum </S>",
    "<S> dependent case as we consider here , we have two unknowns ( @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) for each given momentum , which can not be uniquely determined without introducing further approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the customary way to do this is to assume some functional dependence on momentum for these potentials . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it was assumed that @xmath13 . since the real part of the single particle potential vanishes at very high momentum , we expect the following parameterization to be more appropriate @xmath14 actually , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , this kind of functional dependence was found to fit the dirac phenomenology rather well . </S>",
    "<S> one of the purposes of this work is thus to study whether this kind of simple parameterization is supported by microscopic dbhf calculation . </S>",
    "<S> numerically we find that it is rather difficult to determine the six parameters altogether in the minimization procedure . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked the variation of @xmath15 around 0.5 , and find that @xmath16 provides a smooth self - consistent procedure , and the final results are not very sensitive to some small change in @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining four parameters are then determined by a minimization procedure , @xmath17    our self - consistent procedure is the following . for a given density as specified by fermi momentum @xmath1 , we choose reasonable initial values for @xmath18 and @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> these , together with eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 4 ) provide @xmath20 for all momenta . </S>",
    "<S> these potentials are then used as inputs in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 1 ) to determine the @xmath2 matrix , from which we obtain the single - particle potential @xmath21 using eq . ( 2 ) . our new set of @xmath18 and @xmath19 can then be determined by minimizing eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eqchisq ] ) against @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is continued until desired self - consistency is achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the quality of our self - consistency procedure can be seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ figmsp ] where we compare the single - particle potential from the dbhf calculation ( solid symbols ) and from eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> there are slight deviations near @xmath22 because in our definition of @xmath23 , eq . ( 5 ) , the contributions from small momenta are suppressed . </S>",

    "<S> the schrdinger equivalent potential from our self - consistent calculation still show stronger kinetic energy dependence than that of the dirac phenomenology . </S>",
    "<S> the onset of inelastic processes at high beam energies might explain part of this discrepancy .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also of interest to see how the nuclear equation of state are affected by the explicit momentum dependence . </S>",
