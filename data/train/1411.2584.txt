    "the sampling kantorovich operators have been introduced to approximate and reconstruct not necessarily continuous signals . in @xcite",

    "clearly , this is the most natural mathematical modification to obtain operators which can be well - defined also for general measurable , locally integrable functions , not necessarily continuous .",
    "moreover , this situation very often occur in signal processing , when one can not match exactly the sample at the point @xmath3 : this represents the so - called \" time - jitter  error .",
    "the theory of sampling kantorovich operators allow us to reduces the time - jitter error , calculating the information in a neighborhood of @xmath3 rather that exactly in the node @xmath3 .",
    "these operators , as the generalized sampling operators , represent an approximate version of classical sampling series , based on the whittaker - kotelnikov - shannon sampling theorem ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , the sampling kantorovich operators have been studied in various settings . in @xcite the multivariate version of these operators",

    "thermographic images are widely used to make non - invasive investigations of structures , to analyze the story of the building wall , to make diagnosis and monitoring buildings , and to make structural measurements .",
    "a further important use , is the application of the texture algorithm for the separation between the bricks and the mortar in masonries images . through this procedure",

    "see e.g. @xcite .",
    "in this section , we show applications of the multivariate sampling kantorovich operators to image reconstruction .",
    "first of all , we recall that every bi - dimensional gray scale image @xmath179 is represented by a suitable matrix and can be modeled as a step function @xmath180 , with compact support , belonging to @xmath181 , @xmath182 .",
    "the definition of @xmath180 arise naturally as follows : @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 , are the characteristics functions of the sets @xmath186\\times(j-1,\\ j]$ ] ( i.e. @xmath187 , for @xmath188\\times(j-1,\\ j]$ ] and @xmath189 otherwise ) .",
    "the above function @xmath190 is defined in such a way that , to every pixel @xmath191 it is associated the corresponding gray level @xmath192 .",
    "we can now consider approximation of the original image by the bivariate sampling kantorovich operators @xmath193 based upon some kernel @xmath79 .",
    "then , in order to obtain a new image ( matrix ) that approximates in @xmath123-sense the original one , it is sufficient to sample @xmath194 ( for some @xmath13 ) with a fixed sampling rate . in particular , we can reconstruct the approximating images ( matrices ) taking into consideration different sampling rates and this is possible since we know the analytic expression of @xmath194 .",
    "if the sampling rate is chosen higher than the original sampling rate , one can get a new image that has a better resolution than the original one s .",
    "the above procedure has been implemented by using matlab and tools of matrix computation in order to obtain an optimized algorithm based on the multivariate sampling kantorovich theory .    in the next sections , examples of thermographic images reconstructed by the sampling kantorovich operators",
    "will be given to show the main applications of the theory to civil engineering .",
    "in particular , a real world case - study is analyzed in term of modal analysis to obtain a model useful to study the response of the building under seismic action .",
    "in the present application , thermographic images will be used to locate the resisting elements and to define their dimensions , and moreover to investigate the actual texture of the masonry wall , i.e. , the arrangement of blocks ( bricks and/or stones ) and mortar joints . in general ,",
    "thermographic images have a resolution too low to accurately analyze the texture of the masonries , therefore it has to be increased by means of suitable tools .    in order to obtain a consistent separation of the phases , that is a correct identification of the pixel which belong to the blocks and those who belong to mortar joints ,",
    "the image is converted from gray - scale representation to black - and - white ( binary ) representation by means of an image texture algorithm , which employs techniques belonging to the field of digital image processing .",
    "the image texture algorithm , described in details in @xcite , leads to areas of white pixels identified as blocks and areas of black pixels identified as mortar joints .",
    "however , the direct application of the image texture algorithm to the thermographic images ( see figure  [ fig : original_ric ] ) , can produce errors , as an incorrect separation between the bricks and the mortar ( see figure  [ fig : original_bw ] ) .",
    "therefore , we can use the sampling kantorovich operators to process the thermographic images .",
    "in particular , here we used the operators @xmath0 based upon the bivariate jackson - type kernel with @xmath195 ( see section [ sec5 ] ) and the parameter @xmath196 ( see figure  [ fig : reconstructed_ric ] ) .",
    "the application of the image texture algorithm produces a consistent separation of the phases ( see figure  [ fig : reconstructed_bw ] ) .",
    "0.15 cm 0.15 cm 0.15 cm    in order to perform structural analysis , the mechanical characteristics of an homogeneous material equivalent to the original heterogeneous material are sought .",
    "the equivalence is in the sense that , when subjected to the same boundary conditions ( b.c . ) , the overall responses in terms of mean values of stresses and deformations are the same .",
    "the equivalent elastic properties are estimated by means of the `` test - window '' method @xcite .",
    "the image texture algorithm described previously has been used to analyze a real - world case - study : a building consisting of two levels and an attic , with a very simple architectural plan , a rectangle with sides 11 m and 11.4 m ( see figure  [ fig : pianta_prospetto ] ) .",
    "the vertical structural elements consist of masonry walls . at first level",
    "the masonry walls have thickness of 40 cm with blocks made of stones , while at second level the masonry is made of squared tuff block and it has thickness of about 35 cm .",
    "both surfaces of the walls are plastered .",
    "the slab can be assumed to be rigid in the horizontal plane and the building is placed in a medium risk seismic area . according to a preliminary visual survey",
    ", the structure does not have strong asymmetries between principal directions and the distribution of the masses are quite uniform .",
    "the response of the building is evaluated by means of three different models . in the first model , only information that can be gathered by the visual survey have been used , and the characteristics of material has been assume according to italian building code . in the second model information concerning the actual geometry of vertical structural elements acquired by means of thermographic survey have been used ; for example , the survey showed that the openings at ground level in the main facade were once larger and have been subsequently partially filled with non - structural masonry , and thus the dimensions of all the masonry walls in the facade have to be reduced . eventually , in the third model information about the actual texture of masonries of ground level ( chaotic masonry , fig .",
    "[ fig : chaotic ] ) and of second level ( periodic masonry , fig .",
    "[ fig : periodic ] ) have been used . in particular , the actual textures where established using the reconstructed thermographic images .    0.8 cm    the main characteristics of the models are reported in table  [ tab : char_models ] .",
    "for the mechanical characteristic the young s modulus @xmath197 and the shear modulus @xmath198 are shown . in the third model ,",
    "the following mechanical characteristics ( young s modulus @xmath197 and poisson s ratio @xmath199 ) of the constituent phases have been used : for the stones of the ground level , @xmath200 , for the bricks of the second level @xmath201 , for the mortar of both levels @xmath202 .    the behavior under seismic actions is estimated by means of modal analysis , using a commercial code based on the finite element method .",
    "the periods of the first three modes and the corresponding mass participating ratio for the two principal direction of seismic action are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab : periodi_masse ] .",
    "for all the models , the first mode is along the @xmath203 axis , the second is along the @xmath204 axis , and the third is mainly torsional .",
    "anyway , the second mode is not a pure translational one since the asymmetry in the walls distribution produces also a torsional component .    as can be noted",
    ", the first two models have the same period for the fundamental mode in @xmath203 direction ; nevertheless , in @xmath204 direction there is a slight difference due to the reduced dimensions of masonry walls width discovered by means of thermographic survey .",
    "in fact , the reduction of dimensions leads to a decrease of global stiffness while the total mass is almost the same .",
    "the periods of third model show a reduction of about 20% due to the greater value of equivalent elastic moduli estimated by means of homogenized texture . as already noted , for seismic action in @xmath204 direction the structure response is dominated by second mode , with also a significant contribution from the third mode ( which is torsional ) ; for seismic action in @xmath203 the response is dominated by first mode .",
    "it is also worth noting that model # 3 shows a reduced mass participating ratio for the fundamental mode in each direction , and therefore a greater number of modes should be considered in the evaluation of seismic response in order to achieve a suitable accuracy .",
    "the sampling kantorovich operators and the corresponding matlab algorithm for image reconstruction are very useful to enhance the quality of thermographic images of portions of masonry walls . in particular , after the processing by sampling kantorovich algorithm , the thermographic image has higher definition with respect to the original one and therefore , it was possible to estimate the mechanical characteristics of homogeneous materials equivalent to actual masonries , taking into account the texture ( i.e. , the arrangement of blocks and mortar joints ) .",
    "these materials were used to model the behavior of a case study under seismic action .",
    "this model has been compared with others constructed by well - know methods , using `` naked eyes '' survey and the mechanical parameters for materials taken from the italian building code .",
    "our method based on the processing of thermographic images by sampling kantorovich operators enhances the quality of the model with respect to that based on visual survey only .",
    "in particular the proposed approach allows to overcome some difficulties that arise when dealing with the vulnerability analysis of existing structures , which are : i ) the knowledge of the actual geometry of the walls ( in particular the identification of hidden doors and windows ) ; ii ) the identification of the actual texture of the masonry and the distribution of inclusions and mortar joints , and from this iii ) the estimation of the elastic characteristics of the masonry .",
    "it is noteworthy that , for item i ) the engineer has usually limited knowledge , due to the lack of documentation , while for items ii ) and iii ) he usually use tables proposed in technical manuals and standards which however give large bounds in order to encompass the generality of the real masonries . instead , the use of reconstruction techniques on thermographic images coupled with homogenization permits to reduce these latter uncertainty on the estimation of the mechanical characteristics of the masonry .        c. bardaro , p.l .",
