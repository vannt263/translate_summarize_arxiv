    "understanding the milky way and its neighbourhood , both as a template of the formation and evolution of galaxies and as a laboratory of stellar physics , is one of the great astrophysics challenges at the beginning of the 21st century .",
    "the _ gaia _",
    "satellite @xcite was conceived and designed to constitute a major leap forward in this field .",
    "_ gaia _ was selected as a cornerstone of the european space agency ( esa ) horizon 2000 + programme in october 2000 and confirmed as part of the esa cosmic vision programme in may 2002 and again in november 2003 . the satellite launch is scheduled to take place `` no later than 2012 '' and all the current scientific and industrial studies are consistent with a launch date in mid-2010 .    _ gaia _ s payload consists of 3 instruments : an astrometric instrument , a multi - band photometer ( observing in 5 broad and 11 medium - band filters ) and a spectrometer which will continuously and repeatedly scan the sky during the 5 years of the mission . on average",
    ", 102 spectra will be obtained per source . the astro - photometric `` sample ''",
    "will be complete up to the _ gaia _ magnitude g=20 ( @xmath12 @xmath130.36 for a solar metallicity g5v star ) and will contain more than a billion stars from the galaxy and the local group .",
    "the huge size of the sample ( about 1% of the entire stellar content of the milky way galaxy ) and the accuracy and wealth of information collected about the spatial , kinematic and chemical distributions of the stars will allow _ gaia _ to decipher many aspects of the origin and evolution of our galaxy .",
    "moreover , given the very large number of stars surveyed , even the briefest stages of stellar evolution have a very high probability of being observed by _",
    "gaia_. _ gaia _ will also detect and characterise several thousand extra - solar planetary systems .",
    "it will observe some @xmath14 to @xmath15 minor bodies in the solar system , thousands of galaxies , some @xmath16 quasars , about 10@xmath17 extragalactic supernovae and will provide an accurate determination of several fundamental physical and cosmological parameters ( e.g. @xmath18 , @xmath19/@xmath20 , @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) .",
    "the initial concept of _ gaia _ was developed around the astrometric instrument .",
    "however , based on the experience of _ hipparcos _",
    "@xcite , it was clear that the capability of making radial velocity measurements would be central to the successful attainment of the main _ gaia _ science goals . by supplying the third component of the velocity vector",
    "( the other two being provided by the tangential motions ) , the velocity along the line of sight is crucial for the our understanding of the kinematics and dynamics of the galaxy .",
    "radial velocities are also necessary to correct the astrometric data for perspective acceleration ( an apparent displacement on the sky induced by line - of - sight motion and which varies quadratically with time ) : simulations predict that the proper motions and positions of @xmath23 stars ( unknown _ a priori _ ) would be significantly biased if this effect was not removed .",
    "finally , multi - epoch radial velocities are extremely valuable for the detection and characterisation of multiple systems and stellar variability . as _",
    "gaia _ was taking shape , several studies were investigating the feasibility , merits and drawbacks of the acquisition of radial velocities from the ground and from space @xcite . in 1997",
    ", the decision was made to include a spectrograph on board _",
    "gaia_.    a first concept of the spectrograph was designed in 1998 by matra marconi space ( now astrium - sas , toulouse ) .",
    "following the approval of _ gaia _ , esa established , in june 2001 , sixteen scientific working groups to support the development of the satellite and to prepare for the scientific analysis of the data .",
    "one of those groups was charged with the optimisation of the spectrograph , named the `` radial velocity spectrometer '' ( rvs ) , with respect to the _ gaia _ science case . during the following 18 months ,",
    "the rvs working group , with the support of astrium , reviewed and refined the scientific objectives and priorities for the spectrograph , assessed its performance and compared the advantages and disadvantages of several potential rvs configurations .",
    "the scientific requirements and the technical constraints converged toward a refined scientific case and a new spectrograph concept in november 2002 .",
    "the main modification with respect to the matra marconi design is the increase of the resolving power .",
    "a broader scientific case has also been associated with the revised configuration of the spectrograph .",
    "the acquisition of sufficiently accurate radial velocities for the largest possible sample of stars remains the key scientific objective of the rvs .",
    "radial velocities are fundamental for the proper understanding of the milky way structure , origin and history",
    ". however , the increased resolution will make it possible , without affecting the radial velocity performance , to address a wide variety of issues in stellar physics : binarity , evolution , rotation , pulsation and variability , atmospheric chemistry , mixing processes and abundance peculiarities .",
    "the rvs science case and general characteristics ( e.g. spectral resolution , wavelength range ) have now been defined .",
    "the more detailed design features ( such as the number and type of ccds ) remain to be confirmed .",
    "this paper presents the revised and optimised baseline of the radial velocity spectrometer : instrument concept (   [ concept ] ) , optical (   [ optics ] ) and focal plane ( [ focal ] ) characteristics .",
    "although the instrument concept is expected to evolve in future phases , it should remain broadly within the parameters described here .",
    "this paper also presents the rvs calibration (   [ calibration ] ) and observational (   [ observation ] ) strategies .",
    "finally , it reviews the stellar and interstellar parameters that will be provided by the rvs spectra , namely , radial (   [ radial ] ) and rotational (   [ rotational ] ) velocities , atmospheric parameters and individual abundances (   [ atmospheric ] ) as well as interstellar reddening (   [ interstellar ] ) .",
    "the _ gaia _ spectroscopic survey is expected to lead to major improvements in our understanding of the kinematical , dynamical and chemical structure and history of the milky way , as well as in our comprehension of stellar physics and evolution . moreover , it will be ideally suited to the identification and characterisation of multiple systems .",
    "the expected scientific harvest is discussed in a companion paper @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity spectrometer is an integral field spectrograph : it uses neither slits , nor fibres , but disperses all of the light entering its @xmath24 field of view . as with the other _ gaia _ instruments",
    ", it will continuously and repeatedly scan the sky , observing each object , on average , at 102 successive epochs ( see   [ observation ] ) .",
    "the choice of the spectrograph wavelength range ( [ 848 , 874 ] nm : @xcite  @xcite ) was motivated by a number of considerations .",
    "it is close to the peaks of the energy distributions of the rvs principal targets : g and k type stars . in f ,",
    "g and k stars , there are three strong core - saturated ionised calcium lines in this range , which allows the measurement of radial velocities even at very low signal to noise ratios ( _ i.e. _ @xmath25  15  km  s@xmath4 at @xmath26 per pixel , for a k1v type star - see   [ radial ] ) as well as in very metal poor stars . in early type stars , this spectral region is dominated by lines of the hydrogen paschen series , which are visible even in very rapidly rotating stars .",
    "it contains a diffuse interstellar band ( dib ) , located at 862.0  nm , which appears to be a reliable tracer of the interstellar reddening (   [ interstellar ] ) : this will be used , together with the photometric data , to derive a three - dimensional map of galactic interstellar extinction .",
    "in addition , the extinction in the rvs domain will roughly be a factor of two smaller than in the v band .",
    "this will allow the probing of the galactic disk over greater distances than would be feasible at 550 nm . finally , this spectral range is almost free of telluric absorption features and is therefore usable from the ground for pre - launch preparatory ( and possible complementary , post - mission ) observations (   [ spectra ] ) .    in its original conception ,",
    "the spectrograph had an effective resolving power @xmath27 . during the 18 months of the optimisation phase ( june 2001 - november 2002 ) the rvs working group compared the merits and drawbacks of a broad range of resolutions from @xmath28 to 20000 .",
    "the obvious advantage of the `` high '' resolutions is that they carry more spectral information than the `` low '' ones .",
    "the `` weak '' lines are sharper , the contrast between lines and continuum is better and the rate of line blending is lower .",
    "therefore , the high resolution spectra provide more accurate diagnostics for the determination of stellar parameters ( e.g. radial and rotational velocities , atmospheric parameters  see   [ stellar ] ) of most stars except the `` faintest '' .",
    "moreover , for @xmath29 , numerous lines contained in the rvs infra - red wavelength range are unblended and it becomes possible to determine the individual abundances of several chemical species and in particular of alpha elements ( e.g. magnesium , silicon - see   [ atmospheric ] ) .",
    "however , the `` high '' resolutions also present a drawback .",
    "the rvs is an integral field spectrograph . as a consequence , in regions of high stellar density ,",
    "the spectra of neighbouring sources will overlap and the mean rate of overlap grows linearly with resolution .",
    "numerical simulations have shown that it will be possible , to a certain extent , to deconvolve the stacked spectra @xcite  see   [ radial ] .",
    "even so , in very crowded areas the faintest sources will be lost in the noise . in those very dense regions ,",
    "the limiting magnitude that the rvs can reach is a decreasing function of the resolution .",
    "after extensive consideration within the working group of the advantages and disadvantages of resolving powers between @xmath28 and 20000 , a resolving power @xmath30 was shown to be optimal for the fulfilment of _ gaia _ s scientific objectives .",
    "this resolution will allow the radial velocities of late - type stars to be determined with a precision @xmath31  10 - 20 km  s@xmath4 up to @xmath9  17 - 18 ( reaching a precision of the order of 1  km  s@xmath4 or better for the brightest targets ) , over about 90% of the sky ( sect  [ radial ] )",
    ". the rate of spectral overlap will be lower at @xmath32  11500 than at higher resolution , thereby allowing the rvs to probe fields of higher stellar density .",
    "moreover , with the resolution @xmath32  11500 it will be possible to study the chemical pattern of the sources up to @xmath33 12 - 13 ( sect  [ atmospheric ] ) , while a lower resolution @xmath34  5750 did not allow the derivation of individual abundances because of too much line blending and insufficient contrast between lines and continuum .",
    "table  [ tab : concept ] summarises the global characteristics of the radial velocity spectrometer .",
    ".summary of the rvs general characteristics .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^ , < \" , ]        the initial motivation for the implementation of a spectrograph on board _ gaia _ was the acquisition of radial velocities .",
    "their determination has , to a large extent , driven the definition and optimisation of the characteristics of the rvs . throughout the definition phase",
    ", studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the different proposed configurations .",
    "those studies all rely on similar monte - carlo approaches to derive the rvs radial velocity precision : cross - correlating a large number of rvs - like spectra , either observed @xcite or synthetic @xcite against suitable templates .",
    "subsequently , the simulations have been re - run to evaluate the performance of the rvs adopted baseline as a function of magnitude and for the 6 representative tracer populations listed in table  [ tab : tracers ] . in addition , for each of the three spectral types , f2 ii , b5 ms and f5 ms / to , which could present high rotational velocities , two projected rotational velocities have been considered : a `` low '' and a more `` typical '' value ( see table  [ tab : performances ] ) .    to generate rvs - like observations ,",
    "@xcite synthetic spectra have been convolved to the rvs spectral resolution , normalised to the star magnitude ( according to its atmospheric parameters ) , sampled ( assuming two pixels per psf full width at half maximum - fwhm ) and degraded with photon , background and detector noise , using a simulator of the rvs instrument ( katz 2004 , in preparation ) .",
    "the simulations took into account zodiacal light and faint background stars ( assuming a total surface brightness of @xmath35 mag  arcsec@xmath36 ) , the telescope pupil area , the overall instrument efficiency , the exposure time , the spectral profile perpendicular to the dispersion direction and detector noise .",
    "the performances were derived by monte - carlo simulations .",
    "for each spectral type and magnitude , 1000 or 2000 cross - correlations of rvs - like spectra with kurucz synthetic templates ( convolved at the rvs resolving power ) were performed in direct space . in each case , the precision was derived using a robust estimator of the standard deviation of the distribution of ( 1000 or 2000 ) estimated radial velocities .",
    "after sorting the radial velocities , the standard deviation was estimated using the following formula : @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the 15.85@xmath39 percentile of the sorted distribution of radial velocities and @xmath40 is the 84.15@xmath39 percentile of the same distribution .",
    "this robust estimator gives low weight to the outliers which appear at the faintest magnitudes ( when secondary correlation peaks could be mistaken for the correct correlation peak ) .",
    "future work will focus on the development of techniques to identify and reject these outliers .",
    "the fraction of outliers ( _ i.e. _ the fraction of estimated radial velocities beyond 3 times the estimated dispersion ) is , to a first approximation , a function of the estimated dispersion and of the stellar type . for @xmath41  5 km  s@xmath4",
    "there are @xmath421.5% and @xmath420% outliers , respectively , in the cases of a g5v star and of a f2 ii star .",
    "the fractions of outliers become @xmath4212% and @xmath427% respectively for @xmath41  20 km  s@xmath4 .    in these simulations , the distributions of estimated radial velocities exhibit no statistically significant bias .",
    "many small effects still remain to be taken into account in the full assessment of the rvs accuracy budget .",
    "these include optical aberration , ccd charge transfer inefficiency , instrument and wavelength calibration . in order to account for these missing effects ,",
    "a 40% explicit error margin was added to the rvs performances .",
    "the radial velocity performances , for single observations and at the end of the mission ( after combining the 102 observations collected over the 5 years of the mission ) , are presented in table  [ tab : performances ] .",
    "it is likely that the second order effects will become very significant or even dominant for sufficiently bright stars , for which the present simulations give 1 km  s@xmath4 or better performance .",
    "for this reason , no values below @xmath43  1  km  s@xmath4 are given in table  [ tab : performances ] .",
    "above @xmath44  30 - 40  km  s@xmath4 the performance degrades very rapidly as function of magnitude and the estimation of the performance becomes imprecise . as a consequence , no values above @xmath43  35  km  s@xmath4 are given in table  [ tab : performances ] .",
    "the precisions given in table  [ tab : performances ] have been evaluated for the average number of observations per star , namely 102 transits . as described in",
    "  [ observation ] , the number of epochs of observation will vary with galactic coordinates . as a consequence , the end of mission performances and the range of magnitude probed by the rvs will also vary with galactic coordinates . as an example , for a g5 ms / to and for the minimum ( 54 transits ) , average ( 102 transits ) and maximum ( 239 transits ) number of observations , a precision of @xmath45  km  s@xmath4",
    "is obtained respectively for @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 mag .",
    "another parameter which varies with galactic coordinates and which will impact on the rvs performance is the stellar density .",
    "this is discussed in the next section .      because the rvs is an integral field spectrograph , some degree of spectral overlap is unavoidable , even in regions with a low stellar density .",
    "consequently , the background to be subtracted from any spectrum consists not only of the smooth zodiacal light contribution but also of discrete jumpy spectral tracings of ( partially ) overlapping stars .",
    "[ fig : crowding ] depicts examples of such background spectra : on the left , a low density region ( 1000 stars@xmath49deg@xmath50 with @xmath51 ) typical for the `` high '' galactic latitudes ( @xmath52 ) and on the right , a higher density region ( 6000 stars@xmath49deg@xmath50 with @xmath51 ) representative of the range of latitudes : @xmath53 .",
    "overlaps of the brightest background stars are rare and occur only on a small number of transits .",
    "their contribution to the overall background is not , however , negligible and their spectral lines can degrade the accuracies of the radial velocity or other parameters .",
    "[ fig : crowding ] shows the background accumulated over the whole mission , excluding transits with overlapping stars brighter than @xmath54 .",
    "the loss of integrated signal corresponding to the rejection of the transits containing `` bright '' contaminating stars is acceptably low .",
    "bright ( @xmath55 ) overlappers are present in @xmath56%(galactic halo ) or @xmath57%  ( galactic plane ) of all transits .",
    "the bottom panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : crowding ] plot individual contributions from the ten strongest overlapping stars fainter than @xmath54 while the top panels show the background signal which is the sum of these 10 and several fainter contributors .",
    "the fluxes are given in units of the flux from a v=17 k1  v star integrated over the whole mission ( 102 transits ) . note that the accumulated background is very smooth .",
    "lines from individual overlapping stars become diluted by the continuum contributions of other overlapping stars in the same and other transits",
    ".    the background can be very well modelled from information that is available from _ gaia _ s astrometric and photometric measurements ( stellar positions , magnitudes , rough spectral types and velocities of overlapping stars ) . in fig .  [",
    "fig : crowding ] it is assumed that stellar positions and magnitudes are accurately known which is certainly true given the excellent astrometric accuracy combined with the photometric and star mapper measurements . also , spectral information could be derived from photometric observations : in fig .",
    "[ fig : crowding ] a mismatch of 250  k in temperature and 0.5  dex in metallicity and gravity are assumed .",
    "we note that this is conservative , as the final errors on these parameters are expected to be roughly half these values . if , in addition , some knowledge ( provided by the rvs ) on the radial velocities of the overlapping stars is assumed the overall background can be modelled .    from the above paragraph",
    ", it would appear that the radial velocities are simultaneously necessary to model both the background and the unknown information one wants to extract from the spectra .",
    "one possible approach to solve this problem is to proceed in an iterative way . at each iteration , the `` stacked '' spectra are analysed , one by one , from the brightest to the faintest star .",
    "the analysis of each spectrum is made of two consecutive steps : modelling and subtraction of the background and then derivation of the radial velocity .",
    "on the first iteration , the background of a given star is modelled using the first estimates of the radial velocities of the sources brighter than this star ( which have already been analysed ) and using only the level and shape of the continua of the fainter stars ( whose radial velocities have not yet been estimated ) . at the end of the first iteration ,",
    "an estimate of the radial velocity of each of the `` stacked '' stars has been derived",
    ". the process is then iterated .",
    "the new or refined estimates of the radial velocities are used to refine the background modelling which , in turn , is used to refine the estimates of the radial velocities .",
    "the simulations performed to compute fig .  [ fig : crowding ] assume that the radial velocities are known with precisions of : @xmath58 km  s@xmath4 at @xmath54 and 20 km  s@xmath4 at @xmath59  @xmath60  17 ( this simulates an intermediate stage of the iterative process ) .",
    "the result of the background modelling ( grey lines in the top panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : crowding ] ) is encouraging .",
    "first tests based on the background modelling technique @xcite inspire confidence that radial velocities can be obtained from such overlapping spectra with moderate degradation of performance up to @xmath61  stars / deg@xmath50 with @xmath59  @xmath62  17",
    ".    the information obtainable from crowded regions will be worse than for sparsely populated ones .",
    "nevertheless , the overlapping stars degrade the rvs accuracy mainly by increasing the background shot noise level .",
    "such a conclusion is justified if one can rely on the accurate knowledge of the flux throughput of the instrument and on accurate spectral modelling of the background stars . in forthcoming studies ,",
    "we intend to investigate this issue in detail and , in particular , to implement and test the full iterative analysis process .      _ gaia _ will rely on a large variety of observables to classify and parameterise the stars @xcite : distances ( and therefore absolute magnitudes ) , 5 broad photometric bands , 11 medium photometric bands and @xmath63 spectra over the wavelength range [ 848 , 874 ]  nm . in this section we focus on the information contained in the spectroscopic data .",
    "the spectral richness of the rvs wavelength range gives a broad diversity of line absorption responses which vary with @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 $ ] . as a consequence",
    ", the rvs spectral range contains all the required information to derive the stellar atmospheric parameters .    at present",
    ", the spectroscopic determination of the atmospheric parameters requires the micro - turbulence velocity to be constrained . in the future , this _ ad hoc _ parameter will be replaced by a 3-dimensional description of the stellar atmospheric structure ( temperature , pressure _ etc . _ ) and velocity field .",
    "many methods have been developed to determine stellar atmospheric parameters from spectra .",
    "one widely - used technique is detailed stellar spectral analysis .",
    "the effective temperature and surface gravity are constrained by requiring that abundances derived from different lines be independent of the line excitation potential ( for a given element ) and of the element ionisation stage .",
    "this method ( even fully automated ) is not suited for the analysis of rvs spectra because of the absence of sets of weak unblended lines from given elements in two different ionisation stages , which would allow the ionisation equilibrium to be constrained .",
    "alternative techniques have been developed based on automatic comparison using the minimum distance method between measured and synthetic spectral quantities such as the equivalent widths ( ew ) of strong lines @xcite .",
    "these methods also require a `` good '' s / n ratio , which reduces their performance for faint stars .",
    "for this reason , different techniques have been developed in order to analyse spectra of moderate to low s / n ratios . in these techniques ,",
    "the set of ew values have been replaced by the whole spectrum @xcite , diminishing the effect of a low s / n ratio and producing results comparable to detailed analysis based on spectra with high resolution . @xcite",
    "have used a grid of synthetic spectra to explore the influence of resolution on the recovered atmospheric parameters of late - type stars .",
    "they concluded that resolutions @xmath67  12000 and higher were appropriate to recover the three main atmospheric parameters .",
    "@xcite has evaluated the performance of the comparison of full spectra using the minimum distance method in the rvs wavelength range and assuming a resolving power half that adopted for _",
    "gaia_. she degraded the observed spectra from the library of @xcite to a s / n=20 and compared each spectrum to the rest of the library one - by - one .",

    "a s / n=20 by the end of the mission corresponds to @xmath71 14.5 for a k1iii star , @xmath72 for a g5v star and @xmath73 for an f2 ii star . because of its higher resolution",
    ", the rvs performances are expected to be better than this .",
    "another way to extract the atmospheric parameters is to use neural networks @xcite .",
    "tests have demonstrated @xcite that using the r=5800 library of @xcite , @xmath64 can be determined to within 5% , @xmath65 within 0.5 ( solar metallicity ) to 1.0 ( metal poor stars ) and [ fe / h ] within 0.3 dex .",
    "up to @xmath74 , the atmospheric parameters will be derived using not only the spectroscopic observations , but also ( and jointly ) the astrometric and photometric data .",
    "the global precision of the atmospheric parameters from _ gaia _ should be higher than that estimated from the spectroscopic information alone , which is presented here .",
    "the astrometric and photometric observations will also allow the evaluation of the atmospheric parameters of the fainter stars .    for the brightest stars , measurements of equivalent widths and/or synthetic profile fitting will allow the extraction of individual abundances from rvs spectra .",
    "the elements concerned are mainly fe , ca , mg and si for the late - type stars f , g , and k. the abundances of other elements like n can be derived in hotter stars such as a - type stars . for the cooler stars , k and m types , molecular bands can provide information on c , n or tio abundances .",
    "this raises the possibility of investigations into the chemical evolution of the galaxy . due to the quality of the spectra ,",
    "the error on the deduced stellar abundance of a chemical element depends on the resolution , the s / n and the spectral sampling on the ccd . using cayrel s formula @xcite , the error on an equivalent width measurement of 0.005  nm at a resolution @xmath75 and for @xmath76 50 , is 0.0015  nm , corresponding , for this weak line , to an error of 0.13 dex on the abundance . a s / n=50 ( at the end of the mission )",

    "the f2 supergiant was not considered in this study , because the macro - turbulent motion in its pulsating atmosphere affects the line profiles , which can not therefore be used to estimate the rotational velocity .    as the first step towards a detailed and more accurate estimation of the precision of @xmath79 determinations , only single parameter fits were performed .",
    "this is the best - case scenario , because it is assumed that the other stellar parameters ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath83 ) are exactly known and in the fitting procedure spectra which differ only in @xmath79 are used .",

    "results are still preliminary , but suggest that an offset of 0.5 in @xmath65 does not substantially influence the precision of the estimated rotational velocity ; the precision of @xmath79 is not significantly affected by a mismatch of up to 125  k in effective temperature ; errors of 0.1 dex in metallicity do not seem to affect significantly the precision of @xmath79 , while a 0.25 dex mismatch leads to degraded rotational velocities ( @xmath8710 km  s@xmath4 ) ; and errors in radial velocity of 10 km  s@xmath4 lead to errors in rotational velocities of more than 10 km  s@xmath4 .",
    "the results presented in fig .  [ fig : vsini ] are considered only as a first order estimation of the performance of _ gaia _ in the field of stellar rotation determination .",
    "these results were obtained using synthetic stellar spectra and , therefore , modelling uncertainties and chemical composition peculiarities were not taken into account .",
    "furthermore , in regions of high stellar density , the effect of crowding will also undoubtedly degrade the determination of the rotational broadening of spectral lines .",
    "the preliminary results also show that the effects of the combined errors in template parameters ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath80 $ ] , @xmath81 $ ] , @xmath83 ) are not easy to predict .",
    "while all the results presented here were obtained by single parameter ( @xmath79 ) fitting , more accurate estimations of the performance will be obtained in multi - parameter fitting simulations .",
    "the performance of other analysis techniques will also be assessed in future work .",
    "for example , cross - correlation techniques would allow us to disentangle the combined effect of rotational broadening , [ fe / h ] and radial velocity , which respectively influence the width , the area and the position of the cross - correlation function .",
    "moreover , using a box - shaped template would make the determination less sensitive to spectral mismatch .",
    "_ gaia _ will accurately place all the observed stars in a 3-dimensional representation of the galaxy .",
    "the synergy between spectroscopy and multi - band photometry will allow _ gaia _ to quantify the reddening law and the amount of extinction of interstellar origin in any direction and to any distance through the galaxy .",
    "continuity of the reddening along the line of sight will serve to isolate _ deviant _",
    "points during the iterative building of the 3d galactic extinction map .",
    "most of these deviant points will either be due to the use of incorrect models for the intrinsic energy distributions or to circumstellar absorption .",
    "a direct probe , independent of the modelling of the intrinsic energy distribution of the targets , would be valuable in calibrating the zero point and scale of the 3-dimensional extinction map during its iterative assembly , in distinguishing between the alternative causes of deviation mentioned above and in providing some clues to the nature of the intervening absorbing material .",
    "_ gaia _ spectroscopy can provide such a direct probe .",
    "this is not in the form of atomic absorption lines , however , because no sufficiently strong resonant line lies within the _ gaia _ spectroscopic interval .",
    "such atomic absorption lines would trace the gaseous phase of the interstellar / circumstellar medium and a gas - to - dust ratio would have to be adopted in order to convert it into extinction .",
    "the interstellar medium , however , also manifests itself on spectra with absorption features other than those of atomic origin .",
    "these are termed _ diffuse interstellar bands _ ( dibs ) .",
    "one such dib lies right at the centre of the _ gaia_-rvs spectral range , at 862.0  nm , where no significant spectral features appear in the spectra of hot stars ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) - the best suited to trace interstellar absorption to the furthest distances .",
    "@xcite was the first to investigate this band in detail and found a remarkable correlation of its intensity with reddening .",
    "such a relation is unusual among dibs , which on average show only a mild correlation with reddening @xcite .",
    "@xcite enlarged the sample of investigated stars ( covering a larger range of galactic coordinates and distances ) and reinforced the evidence for such a relation , which takes the form ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dib ] ) :    @xmath88    were e.w . is the equivalent width of the 862.0  nm dib .",
    "such a tight relation with reddening suggests a direct association between the carrier(s ) of the 862.0  nm dib and the dust phase of the interstellar medium . the dimensions and composition of interstellar dust grains",
    "change through the galaxy leading to the known effects of the 217.5  nm bump or the ultraviolet slope of the extinction law .",
    "it may be expected that these changes will affect the slope of eq.(2 ) which can be generalised to cylindrical coordinates mapping the 3d structure of the galaxy as :    @xmath89    both the extinction and reddening law map the solid phase of the interstellar medium ( _ i.e. _ the dimensions and chemistry of the dust grains ) .",
    "the nature of the dib carriers is still unknown , even if they are generally believed to be associated with complex molecules , and this makes dibs potentially useful to trace ( at least in part ) the gaseous phase of the interstellar medium .",
    "it may be expected that regions deviating from the dust characteristics of the diffuse interstellar medium ( as in some circumstellar nebulae and winds ) will display a 862 nm dib deviating from the above relation . in this",
    "regard , while _ gaia _ photometry will be by far the main tool for the derivation of reddening information , the 862 nm dib appears to be a useful probe of the conditions within the interstellar medium .",
    "for example , hd  62542 has one of the most extreme ultraviolet extinction curves known , featuring a very broad , shortwardly - displaced 217.5  nm bump and an extremely steep far - uv rise . in spite of an estimated @xmath90=0.35",
    ", it does not show appreciable signs of classical 578.0 , 579.7 , 627.0 , 628.4 , and 661.4  nm dibs in its optical spectrum @xcite .",
    "an 862.0  nm dib as weak as that corresponding to @xmath90=0.10 should be easily identifiable on the @xmath91=11500 _",
    "gaia_-rvs spectra of all early type stars with s / n@xmath92100 .",
    "this will provide a great opportunity for the direct probing of the interstellar and circumstellar medium , independent of the photometric approach .",
    "additional , dedicated , ground - based observations to investigate the nature and behaviour of the 862 nm dib in more detail prior to the _ gaia _ launch are to be encouraged .",
    "the development of the on - ground data archiving and processing system is one of the key challenges during the preparation for the rvs and for _ gaia _ in general . during the 5 years of the mission ,",
    "_ gaia _ will collect about @xmath93 billion spectra of @xmath94 million stars as well as astrometric data and multi - band photometry for about a billion stars .",
    "the calibration and analysis of such a huge amount of heterogeneous data ( all spectral types and luminosity classes including variable and peculiar stars , single and multiple systems , very different field stellar densities and therefore levels of crowding , different temporal sampling as a function of galactic coordinates , three different instruments ) , as well as the particular observing mode ( continuous and repeated scans of the celestial sphere ) require new , robust and fully - automated methods to be developed .",
    "the rvs data will not be processed independently of the astrometric and photometric observations : on the contrary , specific methods will be developed to calibrate and analyse the _ gaia _ data , as much as possible , in a global way using the whole body of information provided by the three instruments .",
    "the `` _ _ gaia _ database access and analysis study _ '' ( gdaas ) , ( 2000 - 2004 ) , is developing a prototype of the data archiving and processing system . at the time of writing ,",
    "mid-2004 , a prototype of the data model and archiving system is in place and several algorithms , including the astrometric global iterative solution , have been implemented and tested @xcite . by the end of the study , more than 20 algorithms , including a non - optimised derivation of the radial velocities , should be in place .",
    "the gdaas activity will be replaced from @xmath32006 by the development of the full _ gaia _ archiving and analysis system .    in parallel with the development of data processing tools , studies are in progress to improve our knowledge of atomic and molecular data , to refine the computation of stellar models and synthetic spectra and to build libraries of observed reference spectra .",
    "all this information will be used by the calibration and analysis processes and their quality will be directly reflected in the accuracy of the derived stellar and interstellar parameters .",
    "the radial velocity spectrometer is a @xmath95 integral field spectrograph observing in tdi scan mode over the wavelength range [ 848 , 874 ]  nm with a resolving power @xmath96 .",
    "the rvs will provide a rich harvest of stellar and interstellar parameters : radial velocities up to magnitude @xmath71 17 - 18 , rotational velocities with precisions for late type stars of @xmath8 km  s@xmath4 at @xmath71  15 , individual element abundances ( for stars with @xmath97  12 - 13  mag ) and interstellar reddening .",
    "it will also contribute , together with the astrometric and photometric data , to the determination of the atmospheric parameters of stars brighter than @xmath9  14 - 15 .",
    "moreover , many stellar processes will imprint their distinctive signatures in the rvs spectra : e.g. pulsation and variability , mixing , accretion , winds and mass loss .",
    "finally , the large number of epochs of observation will make it possible to detect and characterise binary and multiple stellar systems as well as periodic and transient phenomena .    during the two years 2001 - 2002",
    ", the rvs preparation studies were mainly focused on the definition of the instrument scientific case and on the comparison of the performance of the different possible configurations .",
    "these studies converged in late 2002 with the selection of the baseline concept .",
    "the rvs work is now mainly devoted to ( i ) the optimisation and development of the instrument design , ( ii ) the simulation of more realistic rvs - like spectra which will be used to refine the evaluation of the performance of the spectrograph and ( iii ) the definition and development of the on - board and on - ground data processing algorithms .",
