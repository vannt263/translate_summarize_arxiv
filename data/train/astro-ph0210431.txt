    "groups and clusters of galaxies shine in x - rays due to the thermal bremsstrahlung radiation emitted by the hot intracluster medium ( icm ) they contain .",
    "but the poorer groups are found to be progressively underluminous , so as to lie substantially below the simple scaling @xmath3 .",
    "for the latter to hold , in the luminosity @xmath4 the icm number density @xmath5 would have to be proportional to the gravitationally dominant dm mass density @xmath6 .",
    "this constraint adds to the temperature @xmath7 being close the virial value @xmath8 and the size @xmath9 scaling as the virial radius @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , the observed @xmath0 correlation has a shape more like @xmath11 for richness @xmath12 clusters ( kaiser 1991 ) , and in moving toward poor groups it bends further down to @xmath13 or steeper ( ponman , cannon , & navarro 1999 ; see also   3 ) .",
    "so in groups the icm is considerably underdense relative to the cluster values @xmath14 .",
    "correspondingly , the central icm entropy @xmath15 deviates upwards from the simple scaling @xmath16 , to attain in poor groups the ` floor ' value @xmath17 kev @xmath18 ( lloyd - davies , ponman & cannon 2000 ) .",
    "this requires a density deficit associated with increased or constant @xmath19 .",
    "such a non - adiabatic behavior may be traced back to energy losses from , or additions to the icm .",
    "here we focus on the ` heating ' that arises as the baryons in the member galaxies condense into stars followed by sne , or accrete onto a supermassive black hole ( bh ) kindling an agn .",
    "two issues stand in the way : ( i ) any extra energy from sources has to compete with the huge thermal value @xmath20 erg for the icm in equilibrium ; ( ii ) the extra energy that can be coupled to it is still poorly known .",
    "we discuss these issues , and derive two observables that bound or probe at group and at galactic scales the amount of energy coupled .",
    "obvious first candidates for energy discharges into the icm are the sn explosions following star formation in the member galaxies of groups and clusters .",
    "prompt , type ii sne canonically release @xmath21 ergs ; these are effectively coupled to the gas when sn remnants propagate cooperatively over galactic scales to drive galactic winds ( ostriker & mckee 1988 ; wang et al .",
    "2001 ; pettini et al . 2001 ; heckman 2002 ) . with a coupling around @xmath22 ,",
    "the energy input ( including winds from hot stars ) comes to @xmath23 erg per solar mass condensed into stars . in a fiducial group with @xmath24 kev , virial mass @xmath25 and stellar mass around @xmath26",
    ", this would raise by @xmath27 kev the temperature of the entire icm .",
    "the outcome looks like a modest @xmath28 .",
    "actually , sne make optimal use of their energy in that they produce _ hierarchical preheating _ of the icm , while a group and its icm are built up hierarchically through merging events with a range of partners . about half the final dm mass @xmath29",
    "is contributed to the main progenitor by smaller partners with masses within the window @xmath30 to @xmath31 , corresponding to temperatures from @xmath32 down to @xmath33 ( lacey & cole 1993 ; menci & cavaliere 2000 ) .    smaller lumps in the window have shallower gravitational wells and produce more star - related energy on scales closer to the dynamical time @xmath34 ; so they are more effective in heating / ejecting their gas share . during each subsequent step of the hierarchy such gas preheated",
    "_ externally _ will less easily flow into the main progenitor s well .",
    "thus the effects propagate up the hierarchy , and lower icm densities are induced in all structures up to poor clusters .",
    "two main density suppression factors arise in moving from clusters to groups .",
    "these are best discussed on referring to icm in hydrostatic equilibrium within the dm potential well @xmath35 ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 ; jones & forman 1984 ) . in the corresponding icm density run @xmath36}$ ] the energy injection resets the values of @xmath37 and of @xmath38 .",
    "one factor is related to the outflow and is given by @xmath39 ; the latter is lowered by about @xmath32 from rich clusters toward poor groups where stellar preheating provides a contribution to @xmath7 comparable to @xmath8 .",
    "a second factor is the differential containment expressed by the boundary value @xmath38 .",
    "if this is set by jump conditions across the accretion shocks at @xmath40 ( see takizawa & mineshige 1998 ; gheller , pantano & moscardini 1998 ) , the density is further suppressed from clusters to groups by another factor approaching @xmath22 on average , see menci & cavaliere ( 2000 ) .",
    "these authors model the process on grafting the icm equilibrium onto the semi - analytic treatment ( sam ) of star and galaxy formation .",
    "this is based on the merging histories of the dm , and includes star formation and gas heating / ejection by sne in terms of simple recipes .",
    "the latter imply heating to dominate at scales of bright galaxies and larger ; only in small galaxies the gas fractions blown out exceed @xmath41 ( see madau , ferrara & rees 2001 ) .    with sn feedback",
    ", the sams provide detailed fits to the stellar observables .",
    "but the agreement with the available @xmath0 data for poor groups is marginal if both the navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) potential @xmath35 and the standard flat @xmath42-cosmology are adopted .",
    "this is illustrated in next   3 ,",
    "see also borgani et al .",
    "( 2001 ) .",
    "note that the sams include the amount of cooling suitable for baryon condensation to stars , which helps in lowering the icm density . a leading role of cooling ( combined with suitable feedback ) to remove",
    "the low entropy gas has been discussed by bryan ( 2000 ) , muanwong et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , and voit et al .",
    "we will concentrate on a maximal but realistic feedback process .",
    "the natural sources of strong feedback are the agns , energized by accretion of cool baryons onto supermassive bhs in galactic cores ( see wu , fabian & nulsen 2000 ; bower et al .",
    "the outputs are large , of order @xmath43 ergs for an accreted mass @xmath44 , with the standard mass - energy conversion efficiency of order @xmath41 .",
    "if a fraction @xmath45 is coupled to the surrounding medium , the energy actually injected comes to @xmath46 erg per solar mass condensed into stars ; we have used @xmath47 for the ratio of the bh mass to that of the current host bulges ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhardt et al .",
    "2000 ; see also fabian & iwasawa 1999 ) .",
    "compared with sne , agns potentially provide a larger energy output in shorter times , close to @xmath48 of the host galaxies .",
    "however , @xmath45 is more uncertain than the analogous quantity for sne , though is expected to be lower .",
    "the @xmath49 radio - loud agns directly produce large kinetic energies in the form of jets , but to now the observations indicate limited impact on the gas surrounding a number of active sources ( see mcnamara et al .",
    "2001 ; terashima & wilson 2001 ; young , wilson & mundell 2002 ) . in the @xmath50 radio - quiet agns a smaller coupling @xmath51",
    "is expected in view of their flat spectra and of the low photon momenta .",
    "values up to @xmath52 are only conceivable in systems where the photons are heavily scattered / absorbed within the gravitational reach of the bh , and escape in hard x - rays if at all ( fabian , wilman & crawford 2002 ) .    whence the interest in probing @xmath45 from overall effects on the icm . during the agn activity the gas initially contained in a large galaxy or a group",
    "will be heated up and partially blown out .",
    "we will treat blowout and outflow driven _ internally _ in poor groups with @xmath53 kev where @xmath54 .",
    "these effects are maximized in spherical symmetry , not unfit for the radio - quiet agns we consider .    within the structure s dynamical time @xmath34 we describe the transient regime as a blastwave sweeping through the surrounding gas",
    "( see platania et al .",
    "2002 ) ; when @xmath55 holds the leading shock at @xmath56 is not necessarily strong , and dm gravity is important .    from the relevant hydrodynamical equations we have derived ( and illustrate in fig .",
    "1 ) a family of self - similar solutions of the sedov ( 1959 ) type that include the dm gravity , a steep initial density gradient , and centrally injected energy @xmath57 growing over times of order @xmath48 .",
    "the radiative cooling is slow on mass - average in our groups .",
    "our fiducial case will have @xmath58 injected into an initial configuration with @xmath59 , i.e. , isothermal icm in hydrostatic equilibrium ( @xmath60 ) in the potential provided by dm density @xmath61 ; we denote by @xmath62 the modulus of the total initial energy within the shock radius @xmath63 .",
    "then the leading shock moves outward at a costant speed @xmath64 , only moderately supersonic when @xmath65 .",
    "self - similarity implies @xmath66 to be independent of time and position , as is especially simple to see in our fiducial case where @xmath67 . for two values of @xmath68",
    "we show in fig .",
    "1 the density and temperature runs .",
    "the flow begins at a ` piston ' , the inner contact surface where the density diverges weakly while the gas mass within @xmath69 and the temperature @xmath70 vanish .",
    "in fact , the perturbed gas is confined to a shell with inner ( piston ) radius @xmath71 and outer ( shock ) radius @xmath63 .",
    "self - similarity implies the thickness @xmath72 of such a shell to depend only on @xmath68 ; for strong shocks driven by @xmath73 we find @xmath74 , while for a weak shock corresponding to @xmath75 we find @xmath76 .",
    "these considerations lead us to represent our solutions in terms of the simple ` shell approximation ' , known to provide results reliable to better than @xmath77 , see cavaliere & messina ( 1976 ) ; ostriker & mckee ( 1988 ) . in this approximation",
    "the energy balance reads @xmath78 and directly shows the relevance of @xmath68 . here",
    "@xmath79 is the dm mass within @xmath63 ; also , @xmath80 is the volume of the shell ; @xmath81 and @xmath82 are the associated gas mass and mean pressure ; finally , @xmath83 is the postshock velocity given by the rankine - hugoniot conditions .",
    "self - similarity requires all terms in eq .",
    "( 1 ) to scale like @xmath63 ; the coefficients depend only on @xmath68 , and are easily derived following the pattern indicated by the above authors .",
    "we find the ratio of the kinetic to the thermal energy ( i.e. , the @xmath84 to the @xmath85 term on the r.h.s .",
    "of eq .  1 ) to range from @xmath1 up to @xmath86 when @xmath68 increases from @xmath87 to values larger than @xmath12 .",
    "analogously , one may derive the dependence of @xmath64 on @xmath68 , and an analytic approximation to the mass distribution within the shell .",
    "after the passage of the blastwave , and before a major merging event reshuffles the dm mass substantially , the gas recovers hydrostatic equilibrium and again @xmath88}$ ] holds ; but now the governing parameters are those given in table  1 .",
    "the value of @xmath89 ( related to outflow ) is reset using the mass - averaged temperature @xmath90 .",
    "the new icm mass @xmath91 ( left behind by the blowout ) is taken to be that still residing at @xmath92 between the piston and @xmath93 ; thus the boundary condition @xmath38 is reset by requiring consistency with the volume integral of @xmath94 .",
    "we then compute @xmath95 and plot it as a function of temperature in fig .  2 ; here we approximate @xmath90 with @xmath8 , since these differ only modestly as seen from the values of @xmath39 in table  1 .",
    "our results are given for two values of the energy coupled ; these bracket @xmath96 erg corresponding , e.g. , to @xmath97 and to @xmath98 for the largest bh ( or sum of bhs ) formed within @xmath34 in groups with membership around @xmath99 bright galaxies .",
    "the variable @xmath8 may be related to the quantity @xmath68 that governs the blastwave on using @xmath100 @xmath101 , see   1 .",

    "this accounts for the cosmological evolution of the agns that occurs at redshifts @xmath105 , when groups and clusters with increasing @xmath106 are formed by the standard hierarchical clustering . in the critical universe the above",
    "( normalized ) correction stems from : ( a ) the diminishing fraction of member galaxies activated within the increasing @xmath34 , that scales simply as @xmath29 , i.e. , approximately as @xmath107 ; ( b ) all outputs weakening as @xmath108 ( see cavaliere & vittorini 2002 ) . in the standard flat @xmath42-cosmology",

    "two key features are apparent in fig .  2 and are spelled out in table  1 .",
    "first , into the cluster range the deviations from the gravitational scaling vanish because both @xmath110 and @xmath89 saturate to @xmath12 .",
    "second , moving into the group range the luminosity is non - linearly suppressed as @xmath111 , due to the increasing contribution from the blowout as @xmath68 raises toward @xmath12 .",
    "the current x - ray data in groups are seen to require values around @xmath97 in our blastwave model . with these",
    ", the feedback from agns dominates over sne in poor groups , causing stronger suppression of @xmath112 and further bending of the @xmath0 relation .",
    "variance of @xmath45 from @xmath113 to @xmath41 produces a widening strip , but one still consistent with the current data and their scatter .",
    "this also covers the effects of moderate non - spherical deviations .",
    "as our @xmath0 relation intrinsically steepens towards poor groups , we can check it in the adjoining galactic range where cooling still does not dominate . in terms of the velocity dispersion @xmath114 from the virial relation",
    ", we find a steepening correlation @xmath115 ; for the upper values of @xmath45 the slope is @xmath116 in large galaxies with @xmath117 km s@xmath118 , which accords with the detections and the fit by mahdavi & geller ( 2001 ) .",
    "our result is due to a blastwave with @xmath119 causing @xmath120 . down to what scales",
    "can we extend the increasing trend of @xmath68 ?",
    "we argue @xmath68 _ on average _ will not exceed @xmath12 by much , nor will @xmath121 attain @xmath12 .    first , let us impose the limiting constraint @xmath122 to eq .",
    "( 2 ) , and find the accreted masses @xmath123 such values , consistent with those adopted in our computations , for @xmath45 in the range @xmath124 gratifyingly agree with the masses of dark objects detected at the center of many galaxies . also the trend accords with the similar correlation pointed out by ferrarese & merritt ( 2001 ) and gebhardt et al . ( 2001 ) . note that on using the second approximation to @xmath44 discussed after eq .",
    "( 2 ) , our correlation is somewhat flatter than @xmath125 ; it has the slope @xmath126 around @xmath127 km s@xmath118 , and the prefactor @xmath128 .",
    "next we discuss how our limiting value @xmath122 arises in galaxies from bh accretion regulated by the agn itself ( see also silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "on the one hand , sustaining @xmath129 to about @xmath12 requires sufficient cold gas made available for inflow .",
    "the requirement is met by gravitational torques exerted in the host by companion galaxies within small groups , see cavaliere & vittorini ( 2002 ) . during encounter or flyby times of order @xmath34",
    "such interactions destabilize fractional gas masses of order @xmath130 , while the values needed to satisfy eq .",
    "( 3 ) in the host galaxies are only of order @xmath131 .    on the other hand , @xmath68 will be limited if the accretion itself can be affected on the time scale @xmath34 by the agn feedback ; if so , the agn will fade out . declining luminosities",
    "are included in our self - similar blastwave family under the form @xmath132 if the initial density gradient follows a steeper law @xmath133 with @xmath134 .",
    "increasing @xmath135 up to @xmath136 corresponds to @xmath137 going from constant to a spike ; up to @xmath138 the non - linear behavior of @xmath0 around @xmath139 is generic .",
    "but when @xmath135 approaches @xmath136 the time scales effective for @xmath137 become quite shorter than @xmath34 ; the corresponding blastwaves cause larger values of @xmath121 at a given @xmath129 .",
    "this behavior is indicative of runaway conditions prevailing when a galaxy happens to grow a large bh in short times .",
    "then most galactic gas is blown away beyond @xmath93 , so the star formation activity is suppressed already at @xmath140 ( see also granato et al .",
    "such may have been the case for some of the recently discovered eros ( see cimatti et al .",
    "2002 ; alexander et al .",
    "2002 ) .    to sum up",
    ", we find that the agn feedback sharply _ steepens _ the @xmath0 correlation in the poor group range , and _ links _ its shape to that of the galactic @xmath141 correlation .",
    "this is because in moving from clusters to groups the energy @xmath142 injected by agns within @xmath34 grows relative to the unperturbed @xmath143 , and _ overwhelms _ sne .",
    "but on entering the galactic range , @xmath68 approaches unity and constrains the accretion itself .",
    "these correlations provide two linked but observationally independent _ probes _ of the hidden parameter @xmath45 .",
    "on the basis of our blastwave model , the existing x - ray data concur with the optical ones to indicate values around @xmath144 .",
