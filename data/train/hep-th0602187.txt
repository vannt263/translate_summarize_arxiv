    "during the past three decades , static , spatially - localized field configurations have been of great interest in relativistic field theories @xcite .",
    "these nonperturbative solutions of nonlinear field equations have been shown to exist in a wide variety of models , with or without nontrivial vacuum topology .",
    "configurations with stability guaranteed by vacuum topology are called topological solitons .",
    "examples include kinks , strings , monopoles , and textures @xcite .",
    "when the configuration s stability comes from conserved charges , they are called @xmath0-balls @xcite or nontopological solitons @xcite . both topological and nontopological",
    "solitons have many applications in high - energy particle physics and cosmology @xcite .",
    "their widespread appeal relies on two key properties : first , they are stable , that is , they maintain their spatial profile through time .",
    "( of course , if the configurations are allowed to scatter they may or not remain stable and form bound states . )",
    "second , their energy density is spatially localized .",
    "thus , they have been used to model hadrons @xcite , as possible signatures of primordial phase transitions , or to generate the large - scale structure of the universe @xcite .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to present results pertaining to a related but , in this author s view , equally important class of spatially - localized field configurations . their key difference from the solitons mentioned above concerns their temporal behavior : they are _ time - dependent _ , as opposed to static , solutions of the equations of motion .",
    "what makes them potentially interesting for many applications is that , even though they will eventually radiate their energy to spatial infinity , the process is quite slow .",
    "if their lifetime is longer than the typical time - scale in the system they will , for all practical purposes , behave as solitons .",
    "the remarkable fact about these long - lived , time - dependent configurations  called oscillons  is that they owe their longevity to the nonlinearities in the system : no globally - conserved charges or topologically nontrivial boundary conditions are needed ( although they may help extend the oscillon s lifetime ) . as such , they can be found in a much broader class of models .    in the next section oscillons",
    "are briefly introduced , followed by an exploration of their properties in an arbitrary number of spatial dimensions @xcite . in section 3 , the possible effect of oscillons on first order phase transitions",
    "is discussed @xcite . finally , in section 4",
    ", they are applied to cosmology , in particular to a new two - field model of inflation that ends with rapid bubble nucleation .",
    "oscillons were first shown to exist in the context of simple scalar field theories with symmetric and asymmetric double - well potentials @xcite . they were found to be spherically - symmetric , time - dependent solutions of the equations of motion obtained from the @xmath1-dimensional lagrangian@xcite ,    @xmath2    where a dot means time derivative .",
    "the @xmath1-dimensional spatial volume element can be written as @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the surface area of a @xmath1-dimensional sphere of unit radius .",
    "an oscillon is a time - dependent , spatially - localized solution of the equation of motion @xmath5 , characterized by a nearly constant energy , @xmath6 , and by a persistent nonlinear oscillation about its core at @xmath7 .",
    "think of a rubber sheet that is pinched and then let go .",
    "an oscillon would be a localized oscillation on the sheet that does nt get radiated away for a long time .",
    "to find an oscillon , write the scalar field as @xmath8\\exp[-r^2/r^2 ] + \\phi_v~,\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the core value of the field [ @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is its asymptotic value at spatial infinity , determined by @xmath12 . using the gaussian profile of eq .",
    "[ ansatz ] , it has been shown that oscillons are present whenever the energy of the initial configuration @xmath13 is larger than @xmath6 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the oscillon radius that can be obtained analytically @xcite .",
    "in addition , the potential must have a portion where @xmath16 and the field must probe this portion at @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , the oscillon owes its stability to this `` spinodal instability '' in the potential @xcite .",
    "writing @xmath18 and parameterizing the potential as @xcite @xmath19 where the @xmath20 s are constants and the vacuum energy @xmath21 is subtracted from the potential to avoid spurious divergences upon spatial integration , one obtains the equation of motion @xmath22    expanding the amplitude as @xmath23 and linearizing the eom with @xmath24 , it is found that oscillons may only exist if @xmath25 . for quartic potentials with @xmath26 ( that is , symmetric and asymmetric double wells ) , this conditions implies @xmath27}~.\\ ] ] that is , oscillons only exist for lumps above a certain critical size . for @xmath28 , @xmath29 , while for @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "note that since the denominator of eq .",
    "[ minimum - radius ] must be positive , there is also an upper critical dimension for oscillons to exist , @xmath32~.\\ ] ] for a symmetric double - well , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the fact that for these simple models oscillons can only exist below a certain number of spatial dimensions raises an interesting possibility .",
    "let s assume that this model carries the information of the scalar sector of a more realistic field theory .",
    "( farhi _ et al . _ recently found oscillons in a @xmath34 model @xcite . ] then , if extra dimensions exist and are large @xcite , it is conceivable that oscillons could be produced in collisions with high enough energy , @xmath35 . since their lifetime is much longer than the typical time - scales in the system , they would appear as a late fireball concentrated in a volume @xmath36 . furthermore , since @xmath37 , finding an oscillon would provide information about the dimensionality of spacetime @xcite .",
    "in other words , oscillons could be used as probes for the existence of higher dimensions .",
    "recently , oscillons have been shown to emerge dynamically when a system is quenched from a single to a double well potential @xcite .",
    "this means that , under certain conditions , they are spontaneously produced during the nonequilibrium dynamics of the system .",
    "[ the same results would be obtained at @xmath38 , as long as the field starts in , say , a gaussian superposition of momentum modes . ]",
    "the system was initially prepared in a thermal state on a single well and then quenched to a symmetric double well , as is common in ginzbug - landau models of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "the key point is that the system was prepared so that after the quench the field was still localized in one of the wells .",
    "for example , the potential could have been changed from @xmath39 to @xmath40 .",
    "the field would then stay trapped around the @xmath41 minimum .",
    "this is what happens , for example , during the initial stages of a first order phase transition , when the field is initially in a metastable state .",
    "more generally , one can write a potential @xmath42 where @xmath43 is a tunable interaction . initially , @xmath44 and the field is in a single well",
    ". then @xmath43 acquires a positive nonzero value and the potential becomes a double well .",
    "for @xmath45 the double well is symmetric ; for @xmath46 the minimum at @xmath47 is metastable @xcite .     the number of oscillons nucleated between @xmath48 and @xmath49 at @xmath50 , with @xmath51 .",
    "the global emergence is evident early in the simulations .",
    "inset : the probability distribution of radii and periods of oscillation for the oscillons nucleated . ]    the net effect of the quenching is to decrease the effective mass of the field around the minimum . this key point may not be apparent at tree level , especially around @xmath47 .",
    "however , one must remember that the mass must be corrected due to thermal and/or quantum fluctuations .",
    "one way of incorporating these changes is to adopt a simple hartree approximation , shifting the mass from @xmath52 to @xmath53 . before the quench ,",
    "the hartree potential is ( upon rescaling the couplings ) @xmath54\\phi^2 $ ] .",
    "after the quench , @xmath55\\phi + \\frac{1}{2}m_h^2\\phi^2 -\\frac{\\alpha}{3}\\phi^3+\\frac{1}{8}\\phi^4~.\\ ] ] thus , the quench induces a shift in the minimum from @xmath47 to @xmath56 .",
    "this shift , plus the fact that @xmath57 acquires a negative derivative at the origin , explains what happens : the field s zero mode starts oscillating about the shifted minimum , with an amplitude controlled both by @xmath43 and @xmath58 .",
    "these oscillations may induce parametric amplification of a band of @xmath59-modes which , for a range of parameters , trigger the emergence of oscillons @xcite .",
    "the oscillations transfer their energy to higher momentum modes via nonlinear scattering and the oscillons eventually disappear as the system reaches equipartition .",
    "1 shows the number of oscillons nucleated as a function of time .",
    "two points are important : first , oscillons emerge in synchrony .",
    "second , this initial synchrony is gradually lost as equipartition is achieved .     at @xmath60 for several values of the asymmetry in @xmath61 .",
    "( from left to right , @xmath62 .",

    ", the fast quench will generate a distribution of oscillons for a certain range of temperatures .",
    "the efficiency of this production mechanism is sensitive to the quenching time scale , @xmath69 .",
    "if @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is the equilibration time scale of the field s zero - mode , oscillons will be produced . in fig .",
    "2 we show the variation of the average value of @xmath72 after the quench . it can be seen that close to degeneracy ( @xmath73 ) the field spends a long time oscillating about the metastable minimum before decaying to the ground state .",
    "the key point is that a fast enough quench will greatly affect the decay rate @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , a fast quench will promote a much faster decay : for a range of parameters , the decay rate goes from an exponential to a power law suppression , @xmath74^{-b}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath75 can be obtained numerically . for @xmath61",

    "it is clear that a power law is an excellent approximation .",
    "work in @xmath28 is currently under way .",
    "preliminary results indicate that the power law behavior remains , with @xmath77 .",
    "the main consequence of the above result is that whenever the quenching happens fast , using an exponentially - suppressed decay rate as dictated by false - vacuum decay theory is simply incorrect . since @xmath78 $ ] ( or @xmath79 $ ] at @xmath38 )",
    "is widely used in applications ranging from early universe cosmology ( in particular at gut scales , where @xmath80 is fast ) to models of quark - hadron phase transitions in collisions such as in rhic , one should be careful about their range of validity .",
    "it may very well be that transitions that were considered slow in the past are actually quite fast . as an application of what was called `` resonant nucleation '' ( rn ) in ref .",
    "@xcite , i will briefly investigate its possible effects on inflation .     for resonant nucleation as a function of critical nucleation free - energy barrier @xmath81 at @xmath82 , and @xmath60 .",
    "the best fit is a power - law with exponent @xmath83 for @xmath60 , and @xmath84 for @xmath85.,width=288,height=288 ]",
    "the simple elegance of the original `` old '' inflation ( oi ) scenario proposed by guth in 1981 has , since then , inspired many variations @xcite .",
    "more than just the elegance of its formulation , based on a single scalar field decaying from an initial metastable state to a lower - energy state by bubble nucleation , the original oi model had a clear connection with particle physics : the inflaton was to be the same scalar field promoting the symmetry breaking of grand unified models , linking early - universe cosmology to high - energy particle physics .",
    "in fact , it is this particle physics connection that motivated and motivates the widespread use of scalar fields in early - universe physics .    unfortunately , guth s original proposal did nt work .",
    "as he himself argued , and then linde , and albrecht and steinhardt @xcite , the bubble - nucleation rate could not compete with the exponential expansion rate of the universe : the transition would never end . roughly , while bubble walls expanded with the speed of light , their centers receded from each other exponentially fast , making it impossible for the walls to touch , the bubbles to coalesce , and the transition to complete .",
    "old inflation gave rise to a universe with inhomogeneities incompatible with the observed smoothness of the cosmic microwave background @xcite .",
    "guth and weinberg @xcite , and later turner , weinberg , and widrow @xcite , performed a detailed analysis of the constraints needed to render oi and oi - inspired scenarios viable .",
    "they concluded that a strong ( or , equivalently , slow ) first order phase transition based on a single scalar field could not be made to work : the ratio of decay rate to the expansion rate per unit volume [ @xmath86 , had to be sufficiently small @xmath87 initially , so that early bubbles did nt produce inhomogeneities during nucleosynthesis and on the cmb .",

    ", it had also to grow by the end of inflation ( @xmath91 ) to guarantee that the transition was completed @xcite .",
    "[ this implies @xmath92 . ] in other words , successful inflation forced the decay rate to be time - dependent : small at the beginning of inflation and of order unity at the end .",
    "as further work has shown , this could be achieved by invoking more fields @xcite and/or a nonminimal gravitational coupling @xcite .    given what we have learned in the previous section about resonant nucleation",

    "[ see fig .",
    "[ ratio ] .",
    "] however , calculations of bounce actions show that @xmath98 usually scales with inverse powers of coupling constants .",
    "these two requirements compete with each other , making it hard to have small nucleation barriers with small couplings . applying the percolation constraint to the rn rate ,",
    "one obtains @xmath105 . for @xmath106 ,",
    "this gives @xmath107 : small couplings ( or , equivalently , large barriers ) are easier to accommodate with rn , the first reason why it may be useful for inflation .",
    "the second and most important reason is that rn makes it much easier to complete the transition . clearly , if some mechanism capable of producing the same net effect as the fast quenching responsible for rn was present in the early universe , an initially slow first order transition could become fast at some point , going from an exponential to a power law decay . in this way ,",
    "even a potential with a large initial barrier would not be an impediment to the successful termination of inflation .",
    "one possible way of implementing rn in cosmology is to invoke a second field @xmath108 that couples to the nucleating field @xmath72 in a way somewhat reminiscent of hybrid inflation . in that model",
    "the inflaton @xmath72 is coupled quadratically to another scalar field @xmath108 which has a _ symmetric _ double well potential @xcite : @xmath109 inflation is driven by the energy density @xmath110 while the inflaton ( @xmath111 is rolling down along the @xmath112 valley @xcite . as @xmath72 reaches a critical value , @xmath108 becomes spinodally unstable and quickly rolls to one of the minima ( or both , but this creates domain walls , another problem ) , terminating inflation abruptly .",
    "the key difference with the mechanism being proposed here is that bubble nucleation still occurs at the end of inflation .",
    "a possible name is hence _",
    "resonant inflation _",

    "inflation lasts while @xmath108 is rolling down the @xmath47 valley .",
    "notice that the mass term for @xmath72 , @xmath116 , decreases as @xmath108 rolls down its potential . while @xmath117 , the only minimum in the @xmath72 direction is at @xmath47 .",

    "the two minima are degenerate . at this point ,",
    "as @xmath108 continues to approach zero , the minimum at @xmath47 becomes metastable .",
    "oscillations in @xmath72 , induced by the decrease in its mass , will induce rn",
    ". this will be true as long as the decrease in @xmath122 , @xmath123 , is fast enough .",

    "we then obtain , @xmath128 also , if @xmath129 is the number of @xmath130-folds , @xmath131 , where @xmath132 is the value of the field @xmath108 at the beginning ( end ) of the inflationary period .",

    "this condition is also consistent with the approximation @xmath124 for @xmath138 , that is , during inflation .",
    "if slow - roll ends when the minimum in @xmath114 appears , we obtain ( this is similar to the critical condition in hybrid inflation @xcite ) , @xmath139 where we defined for convenience @xmath140 .",
    "the condition for slow variation of @xmath122 during inflation forces the second term on the rhs of eq .",
    "[ newmin ] to be very small .",
    "thus , if we want to impose that the @xmath114 minimum appears close to the end of inflation , we must have @xmath141 , not a difficult condition to satisfy .",
    "as inflation ends , @xmath108 will start rolling down fast towards the @xmath112 minimum and oscillate around it .",
    "since in this regime , @xmath142 , the rapid motion of @xmath108 will induce the time - dependence in @xmath122 needed to trigger resonant bubble nucleation . in order for the transition to end successfully , the percolation constraint @xmath143 , must be satisfied .",
    "this implies , @xmath144 if @xmath136gev and @xmath77 ( as indicated by preliminary results in @xmath28 ) , ri terminates efficiently if @xmath145 .",
    "since the inflationary phase is due to the slow - roll dynamics of the @xmath108 field and not by the metastable field @xmath72 , the percolation constraint can be satisfied by a wide range of couplings . also , since @xmath47 only becomes metastable _",
    "after _ the end of slow roll , there is no need to impose the big bubble constraint : once @xmath108 starts rolling fast at the end of inflation , rn will ensue and rapid bubble nucleation and coalescence will quickly reheat the universe .",
    "although several details remain to be worked out , this preliminary analysis indicates that resonant nucleation can be successfully applied to inflationary cosmology .",
