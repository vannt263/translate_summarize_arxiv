    "the effective meson lagrangians obtained on the basis of the local four - quark interaction of the nambu  jona - lasinio(njl ) type satisfactorily describe low - energy meson physics @xcite .",
    "however , these models contain ultraviolet(uv ) divergences and do not describe quark confinement .",
    "therefore , additional regularization is necessary in these models . besides",
    ", it is impossible to take into account the dependence of the amplitude of different processes on large external momentum in order to provide quark confinement .",
    "this situation restricts the predictive power of these models .",
    "satisfactory results in these models can be obtained only for light mesons and interactions at low energies in the range of @xmath8 gev . in order to overcome these restrictions ,",
    "it is necessary to consider nonlocal versions of these models which allow us to remove uv divergences and describe the quark confinement .",
    "a lot of models of this type were proposed in the last few years .",
    "unfortunately , we can not give here the full list of references concerning this activity .",
    "therefore , we will concentrate only on the direction connected with the nonlocal quark interaction motivated by the instanton theories @xcite .",
    "recently , a few nonlocal models of the this type were proposed @xcite . in these models",
    "the nonlocal kernel is taken in the separable form where each quark line contain form factor following from instanton theories .",
    "these form factors naturally remove uv divergences in quark loops .",
    "thus , in @xcite a nonlocal form factor was chosen in the gaussian form @xmath9 where @xmath3 is the cut - off parameter .",
    "in @xcite it was proposed to use an additional condition for the form factor @xmath10 ( quark mass function @xmath1 , respectively ) which lead to the absence of the poles in the quark propagator .",
    "namely , it is supposed that the scalar part of the quark propagator is expressed through the entire function @xmath11 where @xmath12 is an additional arbitrary parameter .",
    "the similar condition providing confinement was used in @xcite .    in this work",
    "an analogous condition will be used .",
    "however , we will take into account that each quark line contain square of the form factor which is expressed through the quark mass @xmath13 as a result , we obtain a simpler solution for the mass function than in @xcite . in our model @xmath2 and the cut - off parameter @xmath3 have a simple connection in the chiral limit @xmath14 ; the function @xmath1 contains only one arbitrary parameter .",
    "we fix this parameter by weak pion decay .",
    "then , for @xmath15 mev we have @xmath4 mev .",
    "this leads to reasonable predictions for the scalar meson mass , width of the decay @xmath16 and @xmath6 ratio in the decay @xmath17 , where @xmath18,@xmath19 are the partial waves of this decay .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect.[mod ] , we consider a nonlocal four - quark interaction and after bosonization derive the gap equation for dynamical quark mass .",
    "the additional condition for this mass allows us to provide the quark confinement . in sect.[pseudoscalar ] , the masses and couplings of the scalar and pseudoscalar mesons are obtained and the main parameters of the model are fixed . the decay width @xmath20 is calculated . in sect.[axialvector ] , the vector and axial - vector sectors of the model are considered . the @xmath21 meson mass , decay widths @xmath16 , @xmath22 are calculated .",

    "the field @xmath44 has a nonzero vacuum expectation value @xmath45 . in order to obtain a physical scalar field with zero vacuum expectation value ,",
    "it is necessary to shift the scalar field as @xmath46 .",
    "this leads to the appearance of the quark mass function @xmath1 instead of the current quark mass @xmath29 @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the dynamical quark mass . from the action , eq .",
    "( [ acti ] ) , by using @xmath49 one can obtain the gap equation for the dynamical quark mass @xmath50 the right - hand side of this equation is the tadpole of the quark propagator taken in the euclidean domain .",
