    "this can confirm or challenge existing theories of black hole formation , and even more so if we associate the presence of relativistic jets with a large black hole spin . in this case , in fact , the efficiency of accretion @xmath6 ( the fraction of accreted mass transformed into radiation ) is higher than for a non  rotating black hole , reaching a value of @xmath7 for maximally rotating _ accreting _ black holes ( see thorne 1974 ) .",
    "this implies that the eddington luminosity is reached with a smaller accretion rate than for a non  rotating black hole .",

    "the @xmath49 luminosity at this peak is @xmath51 erg s@xmath22 , corresponding to a integrated ir  optical luminosity of @xmath52 erg s@xmath22 .",
    "we associate this emission to the accretion disk .",
    "we can then immediately find the accretion rate assuming the accretion efficiency .",
    "the second method relies on the presence of broad emission lines , that re  emit a fraction @xmath53 ( i.e. their covering factor ) of the ionizing luminosity , assuming that the latter is provided by the accretion disc .",
    "the average value of @xmath53 is around 0.1 ( baldwin & netzer , 1978 ; smith et al . , 1981 ) , with a rather large dispersion .",
    "this method , discussed in detail in calderone et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , is based on templates of line to bolometric luminosities ratios , as the ones presented in francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) or vanden berk et al .",
    "for instance in francis et al .",
    "( 1991 ) the ratio of the total luminosity of the broad line region ( blr hereafter ) to the ly@xmath48 line luminosity is 5.5 , while in van der berk ( 2001 ) is 2.7 .",
    "the sdss optical spectrum of 1146 + 403 shows a prominent ly@xmath48+nv line complex , which is absorbed in its blue part .",
    "doubling the luminosity of only the red part , we obtain @xmath54 erg s@xmath22 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath55=(0.81.7)@xmath56 erg s@xmath22 . if @xmath57 , the disk luminosity is then 10 times greater . within the relevant uncertainties ,",
    "the agreement between the two methods is rather satisfactory .",
    "a robust lower limit to the black hole mass of sdss 1146 + 403 is set by assuming that its disc emits at the eddington luminosity .",
    "this implies @xmath11 .    the commonly used virial method , based on the relation between the ionizing luminosity and the distance of the blr , and on the assumption that the velocity of the clouds is virialized and it is linked to gravity ( e.g. wandel 1997 ; peterson et al .",
    "2004 ) is not ( yet ) applicable in this case , because we do not have the appropriate scaling relations for the ly@xmath48 line ( which in addition has an uncertain fwhm , since its blue wing is absorbed ) and we do not have ( yet ) an ir spectrum of the source that can reveal the civ and the mgii broad lines .",
    "we then apply the method of fitting a disk accretion model spectrum to the data .",
    "we assume a simple shakura & sunyaev disk ( 1973 ) model , which depends only on the black hole mass @xmath58 and on the accretion rate @xmath59 .",
    "the latter is traced by the total disc luminosity @xmath60 . for simplicity , we assume that the black hole is non rotating and set @xmath61 and the last stable orbit at 3  radii .",
    "if we measure @xmath47 ( hence @xmath62 ) , we are left with @xmath58 as the only remaining free parameter . for a given @xmath62 ,",
    "the black hole mass determines the peak frequency of the disc emission .",
    "a larger mass implies a larger disc surface and hence a lower temperature emitting a given luminosity .",
    "therefore , for a fixed @xmath47 , a larger @xmath58 shifts the peak to lower frequencies . then the best agreement with the data fixes @xmath58 ( e.g. calderone et al . 2013 ) . using a larger efficiency",
    "would enhance the emission at high ( rest frame uv ) frequencies . assuming that the disk emits the same @xmath47 , this implies a smaller flux below the disk emission peak . to match the optical  ir emission",

    "the small @xmath14 , relatively large @xmath72 solution implies a much less beamed emission , and therefore demands a greater intrinsic power .",

    "[ comparison ] shows how the sed of 1146 + 403 compares with the sed ( in @xmath49 vs rest frame @xmath77 ) of q0906 + 693 ( @xmath0=5.47 ) and b2 1023 + 25 ( @xmath0=5.3 ) . as can be seen , the three seds are very similar .",
    "all three sources have approximately the same ir  optical spectrum , and also the x  ray spectra are remarkably similar .",
    "the main difference is in the radio band , with sdss 1146 + 403 being under  luminous by a factor @xmath1720 with respect to the other two blazars .",
    "the x  ray emission in blazars is usually produced in a rather compact region of the jet , possibly within the blr .",
    "this is the most efficient way to produce high energy photons through inverse compton scattering , due to the presence of emission line photons , besides the synchrotron photons produced internally to the jet .",
    "furthermore , a compact region can account for the short time variability often shown by blazars . on the other hand , if the x  ray flux is variable , the approximate equal x  ray flux detected in the three sources must be a coincidence . the lack of strong variability could be explained , in the adopted model , by the fact that the x  rays are produced by low energy electrons ( with random lorentz factors @xmath7825 ) scattering emission line photons : since the cooling time @xmath79 , these electrons may have not time to cool in one dynamical time @xmath69 .",
    "consequently , the x  ray flux they produce is less variable than at higher ( @xmath67ray ) energies , characterized by a much shorter cooling time .",
    "the size of the region emitting the radio flux at @xmath17 ghz frequencies must be much larger ( and therefore more external ) than the x  ray region , since otherwise the flux would be self  absorbed .",
    "this is the reason why our one  zone model can not reproduce the radio below a several tens of ghz .",
    "the smaller radio flux of sdss 1146 + 403 could then be due to a jet bending between the x  ray and the radio regions . assuming a constant @xmath73 , the radio deficit ( factor @xmath1720 )",
    "can be explained by a change in viewing angle from @xmath74 ( corresponding to the x  ray production region of the jet ) to @xmath80 ( corresponding to the jet region producing the radio ) .",
    "alternatively , the jet could decelerate between the two regions maintaining the same viewing angle : in this case @xmath14 must decrease by a factor @xmath81 .",
    "however , in this case , the deceleration should correspond to a relevant dissipation , in turn corresponding to some emission , which we do not see .",
    "it would be interesting to observe the source at high radio frequencies ( 100300 ghz , rest frame ) , to see if the radio deficit remains the same or becomes smaller .",
    "in this letter we propose that the radio  loud , high redshift quasar sdss 1146 + 403 is a blazar .",
    "if so , it is the third most distant blazar known up to now , with redshift @xmath20 , that corresponds to a cosmic age 1.1 billion years .",
    "despite this young age , the black hole of sdss 1146 + 403 managed to grow to 5 billion solar masses .",
    "both its thermal and non  thermal components are very luminous . in agreement with the blazar sequence ( fossati et al .",
    "1998 ) the two broad non  thermal humps peak at small frequency .",
    "in particular , the hard x  ray spectrum and the upper limit in the @xmath67ray band constrain the high energy component to peak in the mev region of the spectrum . therefore this source , along with the similar other powerful blazars , should have a relatively large hard x  ray flux and would have been an ideal target for hard x  ray instruments such as the focussing hard x  ray telescope _ nustar _ ( harrison et al . , 2013 ) . the great sensitivity over its energy range [ 580 kev ] would enable it to detect the hard x  ray spectrum of this source , even if it can not directly observe the peak of the high energy hump .",
    "it is possible to roughly estimate the number of these objects and their spatial density .",
    "the comoving density of heavy black holes at high redshifts of radio  loud sources has been studied by volonteri et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , based on the 3 years bat catalog and the blazar luminosity function , in hard x  rays , derived by ajello et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and modified ( beyond @xmath82 ) by ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2010a ) . in the latter paper the observational constrain on the blazar density with black holes heavier than @xmath83 in the redshift bin @xmath84 was based on the detection of only one object : q0906 + 6930 .",
    "assuming it was the only blazar in the entire sky in this redshift bin , ghisellini et al .",
    "( 2010a ) derived a comoving density of @xmath85 gpc@xmath86 of blazars hosting an heavy black hole in the @xmath84 bin ( see fig . 15 in that paper ) .",
    "sdss 1146 + 403 was selected in the sdss catalog covered by first observations , and the common area of the sky of these two surveys is 8770 square degrees .",
    "it is the second source that can be classified as a blazars in this sdss+first survey ( together with b2 1023 + 25 ) .",
    "the comoving volume in the redshift bin @xmath84 is 380 gpc@xmath87 .",
    "therefore the number density of blazars in this redshift bin is @xmath88 gpc@xmath86 .",
    "both b2 1023 + 25 and sdss 1146 + 403 have black holes with @xmath11 . to find out the density of black holes in jetted sources heavier than one billion solar masses",
    ", we should consider that for each jet observed within a viewing angle @xmath89 , there exist another @xmath15 sources pointing in other directions .",
    "so the number density of black holes with @xmath84 , with a mass exceeding @xmath90 , is @xmath91 gpc@xmath86 .",
    "multiplying by the comoving volume gives @xmath173,000 heavy black holes in jetted sources only .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the finding of heavy and early black holes in sources with jets can severely challenge our understanding of black hole growth , especially if we associate the presence of the jet with a rapidly spinning black hole .",
    "a kerr black hole is in fact more efficient to transform gravitational energy into radiation than a non spinning ( radio  quiet ) black hole .",
    "this lends support to the possibility of super  eddington accretion ( volonteri & silk 2014 ) , and/or to the possibility that part of the gravitational energy of the accreting matter is not used to heat the disk , but to amplify the magnetic fields necessary to extract the rotational energy of the black hole ( see e.g. jolley & kunzic 2008 ; shankar et al .",
