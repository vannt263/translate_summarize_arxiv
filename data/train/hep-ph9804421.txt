    "the characteristic expansion time of the universe @xmath69 is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71 is the hubble parameter , which is related to the temperature @xmath72 by @xmath73 .",
    "the condition @xmath74 means that neutrino oscillations have to be fast relative to the collision time .",
    "the relation @xmath75 shows that for temperatures larger than 2 mev the collision time is always much smaller than the expansion time @xcite .",
    "chemical equilibrium for the active neutrinos is maintained at temperatures larger than the neutrino decoupling temperature even in the presence of sterile neutrinos , provided the relevant mixing angles in the primordial plasma are not too large @xcite .",
    "using the relation @xmath76 , the evolution equation ( [ master ] ) for @xmath63 can be rewritten as @xmath77 since by definition @xmath22 is the effective number of massless neutrino species at @xmath78 , in order to get a constraint on the mixing of sterile neutrinos we need to calculate the value of @xmath63 at @xmath78 produced by neutrino oscillations . with the initial condition @xmath79 ( @xmath80 mev ) , the integration of eq.([master1 ] )",

    "the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ p ] ) correspond to oscillations due to @xmath100 and @xmath3 , respectively .",
    "oscillations due to @xmath4 are neglected in eq.([p ] ) because their contribution to @xmath101 ( see eq.([int ] ) ) is at least two orders of magnitude smaller for @xmath102 .    using the expression ( [ p ] )",
    "one can find an analytic form of the integral ( [ int ] ) and the condition ( [ cond ] ) gives the bound @xmath103 with the definitions ( [ defa ] ) this bound holds for both schemes , provided the conditions laid down in i.iv .",

    "let us now discuss the implications of the bound ( [ bound ] ) . in order to understand",

    "in this case we have @xmath105 in scheme a and @xmath106 in scheme b. this means that , in order to accommodate the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , @xmath107 can not be small .",
    "however , this is in contradiction with the inequality ( [ bound ] ) because of the second term in the left - hand side .",
    "therefore , we conclude that the bound ( [ bound ] ) implies that @xmath104 is small , i.e. @xmath24 is small in scheme a and @xmath25 is small in scheme b.    let us now check the validity of this reasoning considering the oscillations due to @xmath100 which generate the second term in eq.([bound ] ) and taking into account that the method considered here only holds for non - resonant neutrino oscillations or adiabatic transitions through a resonance .",
    "looking at eq.([p ] ) we see that there is a resonant behaviour of the oscillations due to @xmath100 at the temperature where the relation @xmath108 is satisfied .",
    "since @xmath109 is negative , this is only possible if @xmath110 is negative .",
    "however , since we do not know the sign of @xmath110 , we have to check if the resonance is crossed adiabatically in the case of a negative sign .",
    "a measure of the adiabaticity of the resonance is given by the parameter @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 are the oscillation frequency and the effective mixing angle in matter . if @xmath114 the adiabatic crossing of the resonance is guaranteed .",
    "clearly , for @xmath115 and @xmath116 this condition is fulfilled .",
    "furthermore , oscillations due to @xmath100 occur around the temperature @xmath117 mev , where @xmath118 .",
    "one can show that for @xmath115 the relation @xmath74 holds for resonant and non - resonant oscillations due to @xmath100 and thus the conditions for the validity of eq.([master ] ) and all relations derived from it are fulfilled as well .",
    "the exclusion of the case @xmath115 with the help of the second term in eq.([bound ] ) is correct .",
    "it is interesting to note that no conclusions can be drawn from the second term in eq.([bound ] ) if @xmath119 because then @xmath120 mev and in this temperature region one has @xmath121 and therefore no oscillations due to @xmath100 are possible because of strong quantum damping .",
    "let us now examine the implications of the first term in eq.([bound ] ) .",
    "the presence of this term implies that either @xmath24 or @xmath122 has to be very small . as we have just shown considering the second term in eq.([bound ] ) , in scheme a @xmath24 is small .",
    "this implies that @xmath123 and only non - resonant oscillations are possible ( see the last term in eq.([p ] ) ) .",
    "hence , eq.([bound ] ) is valid in scheme a and the first term gives the bound @xmath124    on the other hand , considering the second term in eq.([bound ] ) , we have shown that in scheme b the quantity @xmath25 is small .",
    "therefore , in scheme b we have @xmath125 and a resonance occurs at the temperature @xmath126 ) are not fulfilled and the first term of eq.([bound ] ) does not apply . in this case the amount of sterile neutrinos produced at the resonance through non - adiabatic transitions can be calculated with the formula @xcite @xmath127 where @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) is the effective mixing angle before ( after ) the resonance .",
    "the last approximation in eq.([mswres ] ) follows from the fact that @xmath130 because of the high effective neutrino potential before the resonance and @xmath131 for small @xmath25 .",
    "the quantity @xmath132 is the landau  zener probability @xcite and @xmath133 is given by @xcite @xmath134 where @xmath135 is the half - width of the resonance defined in ref .",

    "that @xmath136 one obtains the condition @xmath137 which gives the bound @xmath138 which is large for small @xmath25 .",

    "@xcite because we have taken into account the complete collision rates ( [ gamma ] ) presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are nearly an order of magnitude larger than those used in ref . @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our method shows that the dependence of the bound on @xmath24 in scheme a and @xmath25 in scheme b on the allowed number of neutrino species @xmath22 is logarithmic @xcite .",
    "we want to emphasize that our calculation of the amount of sterile neutrinos brought into equilibrium by oscillations before the onset of bbn is based upon equation ( [ master ] ) in scheme a and upon the landau ",
    "zener approximation in scheme b. therefore , the numbers given in table ( [ table ] ) should be viewed as order of magnitude estimates of the upper bounds on the parameter @xmath24 in scheme a and @xmath25 in scheme b.    concluding this section , we would like to make some comments on the non - standard bbn scenario with a non - zero lepton asymmetry presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "there it has been shown that for a certain range of the mixing parameters and for resonant transitions due to @xmath3 a lepton asymmetry as small as @xmath146 can be amplified up to @xmath147 and in this way transitions at a lower temperature ( like the transitions due to @xmath100 in the schemes under consideration ) can be prevented .",
    "such a scenario would not change our bound for @xmath25 in scheme b , but could have some effect on our considerations for scheme a. it @xmath24 is large in scheme a , a resonance due to @xmath3 occurs and , if a large lepton asymmetry is generated , the oscillations due to @xmath100 are suppressed and the second term on the left - hand side of eq.([bound ] ) is not valid .",
    "hence a large parameter @xmath24 can not be excluded .",
    "therefore , contrary to our discussion in this section , in this case we would have two possibilities for scheme a : either @xmath24 is small and has to obey the bound ( [ bound1a ] ) or @xmath24 is close to one and @xmath25 has to obey the same bound as given in eq.([bound1b ] ) for scheme b. however , judging from the results of ref .",
    "@xcite it has yet to be shown that with @xmath24 close to one a realistic scenario meeting all experimental constraints can actually be achieved in scheme a and we leave this problem to future investigation .",
    "as we have shown in the previous section , bbn suggests that the parameter @xmath24 in scheme a ( @xmath25 in scheme b ) is small . in this section",
    "we present some possibilities to obtain information on the parameter @xmath24 from future results of sbl and lbl neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "we consider explicitly scheme a , but the same results are valid in scheme b after the replacement of @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",

    ", we can choose the parameters @xmath237 and @xmath238 as real .    from eqs.([c ] ) and ( [ 404 ] ) it is obvious that the parameters @xmath239 and @xmath240 are connected , respectively , with the parameters @xmath84 and @xmath241 by the relations @xmath242 furthermore , from the unitarity of @xmath1 it follows that the parameters @xmath243 and @xmath244 are related by @xmath245 similarly , we can think of @xmath237 and @xmath238 being fixed by the unit length of the lines of @xmath1 and five of the remaining complex parameters by the orthogonality of different lines . counting the number of remaining real parameters in @xmath1 we obtain 10 versus 9 physical real parameters in a 4@xmath2464 unitary mixing matrix .",
    "a careful inspection of the residual phase freedom reveals that one of the complex parameters @xmath244 , @xmath247 , @xmath243 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 , @xmath250 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 or @xmath254 can be chosen real in addition .",
    "the significance of the parameters in the matrix ( [ uv ] ) shows up by considering the amplitudes of neutrino oscillations in disappearance and appearance sbl experiments , which are directly connected with the parameters @xmath255 and @xmath256 .",
    "in fact , we have @xmath257 and @xmath258 the sbl oscillation amplitudes do not contain the angles @xmath259 and @xmath260 .",
    "this is connected with the fact that sbl amplitudes are determined by products of vectors in the @xmath34 space or in the @xmath35 space ( see eqs.([aab ] ) and ( [ baa ] ) ) .",
    "however , information on the angle @xmath260 can be obtained from the results of atmospheric and lbl neutrino experiments , whereas the results of solar neutrino experiments give information on the angle @xmath259 .    in the four - neutrino scheme",
    "a the parameters @xmath244 , @xmath247 are small because @xmath261 is small ( see eq.([041 ] ) ) .",
    "let us now investigate if it is possible to obtain bounds on the parameters @xmath262 and @xmath263 from measurable quantities .",
    "we will use the unitarity of the mixing matrix and we will work in the approximation @xmath86 . in this case",
    ", the parameterization ( [ uv ] ) of the mixing matrix reduces to @xmath264 and the amplitude of @xmath27 oscillations is given by ( see eq.([aab ] ) ) @xmath265 furthermore , taking into account that @xmath266 we have @xmath267 from eqs.([060 ] ) and ( [ 063 ] ) and taking into account that @xmath268 ( see eq.([041 ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath269 this lower bound for @xmath270 , obtained in the approximation @xmath271 , is consistent with the lower bound ( [ 081 ] ) on @xmath24 . from the comparison of these two lower bounds it is clear that if @xmath24 is large , its value approximately coincides with @xmath263 , whereas @xmath262 is small if @xmath272 is small .",
    "indeed , it is possible to obtain an upper bound for the parameter @xmath262 using the unitarity relation @xmath273 taking into account that @xmath274 we find from eq.([065 ] ) @xmath275 since @xmath276 ( see eq.([041 ] ) ) , we obtain the upper bound @xmath277 therefore , if the experimental upper bound for the amplitude of sbl @xmath46 transitions is small , @xmath262 is small as well .",
    "note that the observation of sbl inclusive @xmath46 transitions together with the observation of sbl @xmath27 and @xmath278 ( lsnd @xcite ) transitions would allow to get information on the transitions of muon neutrinos into sterile states .",
    "in fact , because of the unitarity of the mixing matrix , for the amplitude @xmath279 of @xmath280 transitions we have @xmath281 hence , we think that it is important to continue the search for neutrino oscillations in the inclusive @xmath46 channel , especially in the region of small @xmath282 , below @xmath283 , which has not been explored so far .",
    "let us consider the possibility that the right side of eq.([070 ] ) will be measured to be different from zero , i.e. , that @xmath280 transitions occur in sbl experiments . in the scheme under consideration the amplitude of these transitions",
    "is given by @xmath284 taking into account that @xmath285 , eqs.([182 ] ) , ( [ 070 ] ) and ( [ 071 ] ) imply that @xmath286    finally , if it will be found that not only @xmath287 sbl transitions but also @xmath46 sbl transitions are strongly suppressed , it will mean that the only oscillation channel involving sterile neutrinos which may be not suppressed is the channel @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , in this case it will be possible to obtain information on transitions of active neutrinos into sterile states only if @xmath7 beams ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) will be available . in this case @xmath289 and @xmath290    let us now consider the possibility that not only @xmath244 , @xmath247 but also @xmath252 , @xmath253 are small , as follows from the smallness of @xmath291 implied by bbn if @xmath21 , as shown in section [ sec3 ] . in this case it is possible to expand all the quantities @xmath255 , @xmath292 , @xmath256 and @xmath293 in powers of the small parameters @xmath244 , @xmath247 , @xmath252 , @xmath253 , up to order @xmath84 , @xmath24 , @xmath294 .",

    "we obtain @xmath295 in this approximation , eqs.([bb ] ) and ( [ aa ] ) become @xmath296 and @xmath297 therefore we have @xmath298 the absolute value of @xmath252 is given by latexmath:[\\[\\label{ps }    absence of @xmath7 disappearance experiments ( see eq.([073 ] ) ) , the determination of the parameter @xmath300 needs further information from lbl experiments .",

    "the reason is that @xmath173 and @xmath155 are small if @xmath301 is small and this is true even if @xmath300 is large , i.e. @xmath24 is large .",
    "this explains the limitations in our search for tests of the bbn constraint on @xmath24 derived in section [ sec3 ] . on the other hand , in the present approximation , for the determination of the values of @xmath302 , @xmath303 and @xmath301 in principle the results of sbl experiments alone are sufficient .",
    "the free parameter @xmath304 is fixed by a measurement of the sbl @xmath305 oscillation amplitude . with the result of the lsnd experiment and the negative result of all other sbl neutrino oscillation experiments @xmath304",
    "is approximately bounded by @xmath306 .",
    "if the bbn constraint on @xmath24 is valid , then @xmath27 transitions are significantly suppressed in sbl neutrino oscillation experiments with an oscillation amplitude of order @xmath307 or smaller .",
    "furthermore , eq.([baa ] ) shows that the oscillation amplitude @xmath184 is at most close to 0.1 .    in the discussion in section [ sec3 ]",
    "we have seen that the bbn bound @xmath21 implies that @xmath308 . in this case",
    "we have @xmath309    inspecting eq.([elements ] ) we note that in scheme a the quantity @xmath151 is now of the same order of magnitude as @xmath84 . as mentioned in the previous section , this is particularly interesting for @xmath310 ev@xmath311 where the bound on @xmath173 from the @xmath6 disappearance experiments is not very stringent and , consequently , in this @xmath3 region @xmath173 should be much smaller than the present upper experimental upper bound .",
    "in addition , also @xmath312 is of the same order of magnitude , showing that at zeroth - order in the expansion over the small quantities @xmath84 and @xmath24 , the mixing matrix is given by @xmath313 therefore , we have @xmath314 hence , the @xmath315  @xmath316 and @xmath317  @xmath318 sectors are decoupled and the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos are independent .",
    "furthermore , since only the small mixing angle msw solutions of the solar neutrino problem seems to be allowed by the data in the case of @xmath26 transitions ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , at zeroth - order in the expansion over the small quantities @xmath84 , @xmath24 and @xmath259 we have @xmath319 similar conclusions are valid in scheme b with @xmath320 replaced by @xmath321 and @xmath322 .",
    "let us now discuss lbl neutrino oscillations . keeping only the dominant terms we get @xmath323 where @xmath324 in scheme a and @xmath325 in scheme b. this shows that there must be significant lbl @xmath27 oscillations because of the sizeable @xmath6 disappearance known from the atmospheric neutrino anomaly , which implies that @xmath326 is large .",
    "for @xmath278 and @xmath178 transitions matter effects have to be taken into account . the upper bounds on these transition probabilities derived in ref .",
    "@xcite are of order @xmath147 . if @xmath24 is small , as follows from the bbn constraint , the `` matter - stable '' bounds on @xmath327 and @xmath328 derived in ref .",
    "@xcite are improved for small values of @xmath3 because of the inequalities @xmath329 leading to @xmath330 hence , the bbn constraint on @xmath24 imply that @xmath331 obviously , the observation of a violation of these inequalities in lbl neutrino oscillation experiments would imply that the bbn constraint on @xmath24 is not valid .",
    "in this paper we have focused our discussion on the two four - neutrino schemes a and b ( see eq.([ab ] ) ) which are compatible with the results of all neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bound @xmath21 for the effective number @xmath22 of light neutrinos before the onset of bbn implies a stringent upper bound on @xmath332 in scheme a and on @xmath25 in scheme b. our limits are more stringent than those of ref .",
    "@xcite because we used the complete collision rates presented in ref . @xcite .",
    "thus , in scheme a we have obtained @xmath333 .",
    "we have demonstrated that in scheme b the limit derives from resonant transitions due to @xmath3 , leading to an upper bound for @xmath25 that is more stringent than the one for @xmath24 in scheme a : @xmath334 .",
    "the validity of these limits from bbn depends to a certain extent on the results of the measurements of the primordial deuterium abundance which are controversial at the moment @xcite .",
    "we have therefore emphasized the importance of terrestrial experiments to get information on the value of @xmath24 in order to check the bbn constraints . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we have worked out lower bounds on @xmath24 in scheme a ( @xmath25 in scheme b ) involving the following observables in sbl experiments :    1 .",
    "the @xmath335 oscillation amplitude @xmath155 ; 2 .",
    "the oscillation amplitude @xmath173 in @xmath6 disappearance experiments for @xmath310 ev@xmath311 ; 3 .",
    "the oscillation amplitudes @xmath172 in reactor disappearance experiments and @xmath37 and @xmath184 in accelerator experiments .",
    "to proceed further , in section [ sec5 ] we have introduced a parameterization of the 4 @xmath246 4 neutrino mixing matrix @xmath1 ( [ uv ] ) which is particularly suited for the schemes a and b. in this parameterization the quantity @xmath24 is given by @xmath336 in scheme a ( @xmath337 in scheme b ) , where @xmath252 and @xmath253 are in general complex parameters in @xmath1 .",
    "the parameterization ( [ uv ] ) has lead us to the following observations :    1 .",
    "the parameter @xmath301 can be determined in sbl @xmath338 oscillation experiments .",
    "2 .   for the determination of @xmath300 in sbl oscillation experiments it is necessary to employ a @xmath7 neutrino beam and perform a disappearance experiment .",
    "3 .   for @xmath21",
    "the sbl oscillation amplitude @xmath155 is at most of order @xmath307 whereas the lbl oscillation amplitude must be of order one in the same channel .    as already pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , the bbn constraint @xmath21 leads to a 4-neutrino mixing picture in which , apart from small corrections of the order of the small quantities @xmath84 and @xmath24 , the mixing matrix @xmath1 is composed by the two decoupled sectors @xmath315  @xmath316 and @xmath317  @xmath318 in scheme a ( @xmath315  @xmath318 and @xmath317  @xmath316 in scheme b ) .",
    "consequently , the oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos are independent .",
    "the solar neutrino problem is solved with @xmath26 oscillations governed by the mixing angle @xmath259 and the atmospheric neutrino anomaly is explained with @xmath27 oscillations governed by the mixing angle @xmath260 ( see eq.([uv ] ) for the definition of these angles ) .",
    "concerning the solar neutrino deficit , it was shown that a vacuum oscillation solution involving sterile neutrinos is rather disfavored by the data ( see refs .",
    "therefore , the specific prediction of a small mixing angle msw solution of the solar neutrino problem with only @xmath26 transitions serves as an indirect check of the schemes a and b under consideration and of the bbn bound .",
    "this prediction implies a characteristic strong distortion of the @xmath339b @xmath5 spectrum and a day - night asymmetry in the neutral current event rate at sno @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this prediction can be checked independently from solar model calculations ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    if indeed the bbn constraints on the 4-neutrino mixing matrix @xmath1 are confirmed then the biggest gap in our knowledge of @xmath1 , the sterile neutrino mixing , is considerably narrowed . in this paper",
    "we have shown that it is possible to test the ensuing mixing matrix to some extent in terrestrial experiments .",
    "the most striking feature in this context is the suppression of all sbl oscillation amplitudes .",
