    "one of the most important method of the nuclen - nucleon interaction investigation is the reaction of the electrons and photons scattering on the deuteron . in the previous works",
    "@xcite ,  @xcite ,  @xcite the reaction of deuteron photodisintegration has been studied on basis of the bethe - salpeter formalism within the framework of one - body approximation .",
    "final state interaction has been considered besides .",
    "however it was insufficient for complete description of experimental data in the wide range of energy . with increasing of photon energy the significant contribution to differential",
    "cross section comes from meson exchange currents .",
    "an appropriate method of description of such effects is the extended siegert theorem  @xcite ,  @xcite .",
    "let s consider it briefly .",
    "generalization of siegert s theorem is made without conventional decomposition of the em current into two parts  the convection current associated with the motion of nucleus as a whole and the intrinsic current  @xcite .",
    "first on needs to construct the matrix element for the absorption of a real photon with three - momentum @xmath0 , while the nuclear system makes a transition from an internal state @xmath1 to a final internal state @xmath2 .    the required matrix element is given by @xmath3    applying the invariance with respect to four translation we may write @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the operator of total four momentum of the system , i.e. @xmath6 introducing eq .   into eq .",
    "we find @xmath7 with @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the destruction and creation operators , respectively , for a photon of three - momentum @xmath0 and unit four - polarization vector @xmath11 .",
    "the transversality condition is @xmath12 .",
    "now we will separate the matrix element into two parts using the identity @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 represent the unit electric and magnetic polarization vectors , respectively .",
    "this identity is equivalent to a gauge transformation of the em potential in qed @xmath16 where the superscript @xmath17 on @xmath18 indicates it is in the transverse gauge , i.e. @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is such an function of @xmath21 that the current has the siegert limit . suppressing the time dependence it means that @xmath22 thus the identity   is a gauge transformation with the following choice for @xmath23 ( foldy gauge  @xcite ) @xmath24 in principle , it should make no difference for the final result at low energies .",
    "however , in approximate many - body calculations with @xmath25 not necessarily conserved , the choice of gauge does become important .",
    "the foldy gauge has the good theoretical property that @xmath26 projects out from @xmath27 only the magnetic part , i.e. all magnetic effects are contained in @xmath28 .",
    "it means that the knowledge of the nonrelativistic one - body nucleon charge density @xmath29 is optimized in the foldy gauge .    substituting eq .   into eq .",
    ", one has @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 is the total energy of the nuclear system in the initial and final states .",
    "the quantities @xmath34 and @xmath35 has the form @xmath36~",

    ", we verify that @xmath38 from eqs .",
    "and we immediately find @xmath39 at this point we are ready to write the @xmath40-matrix element in terms of the matrix elements operators @xmath41 and @xmath42 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ currentelementwithdm ] ) into eq .   and using the relation we obtain @xmath43\\cdot \\textbf{d}_{if}(\\textbf{q})\\nonumber \\\\      & + & \\imath\\left [ \\textbf{q } \\times \\textbf{m}_{if}(\\textbf{q})\\right]\\cdot\\langle 0_\\gamma|\\textbf{a}(q)|1_\\gamma\\rangle .",
    "\\label{smatrixwithdmanda}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    finally introducing the strength of the electric and magnetic fields ( in momentum space ) @xmath44 we cast the @xmath40-matrix element in the manifestly gauge independent form @xmath45    the scattering amplitude for the photon absorption is written in gauge independent form @xmath46 with @xmath47    the last term in eq .",
    "is equal to zero , since it is proportional to the matrix element of the total charge between orthogonal states .",
    "this equation is consistent with requirements of gauge invariance as well as invariance with respect to translations .",

    "and @xmath49    substituting expression for the matrix element of the em current between two relativistic states    @xmath50    into eqs .",
    "and we obtain @xmath51 using the transverse gauge in calculations , i.e. @xmath52 and @xmath53 , one finds that @xmath54 one concludes that this matrix elements gives response of the nuclear system in two transverse perpendicular directions ( defined by the three - vectors @xmath14 and @xmath55 ) with respect to the photon three - momentum @xmath0 .",

    "[ fig1 ] and fig .  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the calculations has performed in nonrelativistic ( shrodinger equation ) and relativistic ( bethe - salpeter equation ) models . in both cases we use graz ii potential of nucleon - nucleon interaction and carry out the computations with and without including two - body current effectively via extended siegert theorem .",
    "we havent taken into account final state interaction in this work .",
    "notations are explained in the figure s captions .",

    "[ fig1 ] that two - body effects give a large contribution to the differential cross section even at the photon energy equal to 20 mev .",
