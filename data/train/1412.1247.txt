    "since the ultimate goal is to extract the values of @xmath5 and @xmath6 , the @xmath4 scattering lengths in the isospin limit , the corrections should not be computed at fixed values of the scattering lengths , but should be parameterized in terms of them .",
    "we have shown that general properties ( analyticity , unitarity , crossing , chiral counting ) provide the necessary tools to do this in a model independent way .",
    "the phases of the two - loop form factors can be computed analytically , and the isospin - breaking correction @xmath28 can be obtained as a function of the scattering lengths in the isospin limit .",
