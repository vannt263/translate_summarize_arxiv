    "accretion onto isolated old neutron stars ( ions ) through the spherical , bondi - accretion mode @xcite has been investigated as a means to produce a population of neutron stars detectable in the rosat x - ray all sky survey ( rass ; ) .",
    "the estimated number of these sources in the rass was initially high ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "however , as observations of higher mean velocities in the radio pulsar population ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) were considered , the predicted number of detectable ions accreting from the ism decreased dramatically ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this is because the bondi accretion rate is a strong function of the ns velocity through the interstellar medium ( ism ) , the geometric sum of the spatial velocity of the ns and the sound speed in the accreted medium .",
    "the sound speed of the ism is low ( @xmath710 km s ) compared to spatial velocities relevant to the present work ( @xmath8100 km s ) , so we assume @xmath9 throughout . ] ",
    "@xmath10    where @xmath11 is the local mass density of the ism .",
    "bondi - accreting ions are expected to have x - ray luminosities @xmath7  and effective temperatures @xmath12 200 ev , both dependent upon the accretion rate",
    ".    there will be a different accretion mode , however , when the ns magnetic field dominates over the gravitational field in attracting accretion from the ism . in this mode , the warm ionized medium ( wim ) attaches to the ns magnetic field at the magnetosphere , accreting directly onto the ns surface . these magnetically accreting isolated old neutron stars ( magacs , `` magics '' ) contrast with ions which accrete through the bondi - mode , in that the bondi accretion rate decreases with the ns velocity , while in magacs , the accretion rate _ increases _ with increasing velocity :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the size - scale for the magnetosphere of a non - rotating ns , where the magnetic energy density from the ns s magnetic moment ( @xmath15 ) is equal to the ram - pressure of the wim .",
    "this gives @xmath16 .",
    "so , for a given magnetic field strength , bondi accretion dominates at low velocities , while magnetic accretion dominates at high velocities .",
    "the evolutionary scenario of magnetically accreting nss has been outlined previously , by harding & leventhal ( * ? ? ? * hl92hereafter ) .",
    "hl92  found magnetised nss first spin down via dipole radiation , followed by a longer spin - down period via the propellor effect .",
    "they restricted their attention to sources with surface magnetic fields g , and found that they are unable to accrete onto the compact object , as the propellor spin - down time is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "a similar line of argument is followed in the review by treves  @xcite in the context of bondi accreting ions .",
    "this limitation does not apply to nss with magnetic fields g ; a ns with magnetic field @xmath17 g and velocity @xmath8=300 km s , spins down in @xmath74 yr .    on the other hand , this same evolutionary scenario was used to argue for magnetic field decay in the ions rx  j0720.4 - 3125 @xcite , and for nss in general @xcite .",
    "we suggest , instead , that high magnetic field ions have not been discovered due to the fact that strong magnetic field sources accreting from the ism are spectrally harder ( we find below ) than bondi accretors , and have been selected against by observers , or confused with background agn",
    ".    moreover , since hl92 s work , observations have revealed nss with considerably stronger magnetic fields than considered by hl92 , in the range of g  the magnetars .",
    "pulse - timing of soft - gamma - ray repeaters @xcite confirms their existence as proposed in earlier theoretical work @xcite .",
    "circumstantial evidence suggests that anomalous x - ray pulsars have similarly strong @xmath3-fields @xcite ; and precision pulsar - timing evidence also implies magnetic fields in excess of g @xcite , confirming less - precise multi - epoch timing solutions which nonetheless led to a magnetar interpretation @xcite .",
    "static solutions for nss have been proposed for surface fields up to @xmath7 g @xcite , although no objects with magnetic fields as high as this have yet been observed .",
    "thus , with theoretical and observational motivation , we reconsider the scenario of hl92 , but with particular attention paid to nss with magnetic fields above g.    in  [ sec : model ] we describe the model for this population , following the scenario of hl92 . in  [ sec : discuss ] , we summarize the properties of magacs , discuss observational ramifications and conclude .",
    "we assume that the neutron star is born with a velocity @xmath18  relative to the inter - stellar medium , and a magnetic moment @xmath19 g cm , which corresponds to a dipole field strength at the ns surface ( 10 km ) of g ( appropriate for magnetars ; ) .",
    "the spin period is initially short ( p@xmath20 sec ) .",
    "we assume the magnetic field does not decay .",
    "we assume a compact object mass @xmath21 @xmath22 , radius @xmath23 cm .",
    "we assume the ns travels through a spatially uniform proton density @xmath24 cm in the wim @xcite . a more detailed examination of the properties of this population , which would include a distribution of ns kick velocities , orbits about a realistic galactic potential , and the galactic gas density and ionization state  such as that performed for bondi accretors and cooling nss @xcite",
    " will be the subject of forthcoming work .",
    "first , hl92  argues that magnetic accretion dominates over bondi accretion when the magnetospheric radius @xmath25 is larger than the bondi accretion radius @xmath26 .",
    "this inequality results in a velocity limitation for a magac :    @xmath27    electromagnetic dipole radiation pressure inhibits accretion from the ism until the light cylinder is external to the magnetospheric radius ( @xmath28 ) , which occurs at a spin period of    @xmath29    the timescale to reach this period through dipole radiation is :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 is the moment of inertia in units of g  cm .",
    "this is a short timescale , compared with the life of the ns . after reaching this period ,",
    "the light cylinder is at the @xmath32 ; however , the ns still can not accrete ( or , accretes inefficiently ) due to the `` propeller effect '' @xcite in which matter is spun away by the magnetosphere , which is outside the keplerian orbit in co - rotation with the neutron star ( the co - rotation radius ) .",
    "this matter is ejected from the system , carrying angular momentum with it , spinning down the ns until the co - rotation radius reaches @xmath32 , at which point the ns will have a spin period :    @xmath33    this spin period is substantially longer ( by three orders of magnitude ) than any spin period yet observed from a ns . the propeller spin - down timescale , when the accretion rate is dominated by magnetospheric accretion , is @xcite :    @xmath34    the @xmath35 timescale dominates the evolutionary time between ns birth and emergence of the ns as a magnetic accretor .",
    "it is comparable to the age of the galaxy ( yr ) velocities already observed among the ns population .",
    "but only for high - magnetic field sources ( g ) .",
    "this makes magnetic accretors with the right combination of magnetic field and velocity observable .    following spin - down via the propeller , matter is accreted onto onto the polar cap of the ns .",
    "the maximum accretion rate onto the compact object is ( hl92 ) :    @xmath36    this @xmath37 is an upper - limit to the mass accretion rate onto the ns surface , and is potentially much lower ( see  [ sec : l ] ) .",
    "moreover , the bondi and magac accretion rates are simply related to the magnetospheric and bondi radius :    @xmath38    if we assume free - fall accretion onto the ns surface , this provides an accretion luminosity of :    @xmath39    to estimate the effective temperature , we take the size of the polar cap to be @xmath40 .",
    "this would seem unusually small ",
    "@xmath7 50 m for @xmath17 g. nonetheless , the effective temperature @xmath41 of this emission is :    @xmath42    note that @xmath43 is independent of the ns velocity .",
    "the accretion luminosity will remain below the local eddington luminosity if :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the proton mass .",
    "the electron scattering cross - section in a strong magnetic field @xmath46 is suppressed from the thomson rate @xmath47 by @xmath48 , with @xmath49=4.4 g , and photon energy @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "this result gives the constraint @xmath51 .",
    "this will not be violated for nss with @xmath2 g unless the ism is un - physically over - dense ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "thus , the accretion rate will be locally sub - eddington .    finally , the ratio of @xmath37 to @xmath53 is :    @xmath54    thus , for the same velocity distribution , magacs will be more luminous than bondi accretors .",
    "we discuss the observational ramifications of this in  [ sec : con ] .",
    "we have two comments on the accretion luminosity .",
    "the first regards the accretion at magnetopause , and the second regards the need for the ism to be ionized in order to be accreted .",
    "arons & lea @xcite performed detailed analytic description of mass transfer across magnetopause in a g ns system , fed by a @xmath55600 km s wind from its companion , but with a substantially higher accretion rate at magnetopause ( 6 g s ) than we consider here .",
    "even at this lower magnetic field strength and higher mass accretion rate , they find a cusp forms with a stand - off shock , causing an interchange instability which mediates accretion onto the compact object .",
    "while inflow at the cusp increases with increasing density , the interchange instability operates more efficiently and prevents very high densities from arising at magnetopause .",
    "three - dimensional mhd simulations find similar results @xcite .",
    "if the interchange instability of arons and lea @xcite permits accretion across the entire ns surface ( rather than just at the magnetic poles ) , then the luminosity would remain the same , while dramatically decreasing the effective temperature , to :    @xmath56    further analysis of accretion onto a magnetic dipole with strength ",
    "g is necessary to estimate the magnitude of the effect on the luminosity and spectrum . for",
    "now , we adopt   as an upper - limit .",
    "secondly , to accrete material via magnetic interaction , the material must be ionized . throughout , we have therefore assumed that magacs accrete from the ( ionized ) wim , and not from the neutral ism .",
    "however , one might wonder if the magac s luminosity is sufficient to ionize the ism by the time it reaches the magnetosphere ( assuming that accretion is already taking place ) .",
    "ionization of the ism by an accreting ions has been examined previously @xcite .",
    "these investigations found that a bondi - accretion luminosity was capable of ionizing the ism well beyond the bondi - accretion radius .",
    "however , we have applied a similar approach to magacs accreting onto the magnetic polar cap , and find the fraction of a neutral ism which would be ionized by the magac at @xmath32 to be @xmath57 , for a broad range of velocities ( 0.1@xmath5810 ) and densities ( 0.1@xmath59100 ) for magnetic field strengths considered here .",
    "therefore , magacs must accrete from the wim , which has a typical density of @xmath70.13 cm for a filling factor of 20% in the plane and a scale height of 1 kpc @xcite .",
    "this justifies our assumption that magacs must accrete from the wim , and not from the neutral ism .      here , we list those effects which will limit the observability of magacs , and which determine the luminosity , spectral hardness , velocity , magnetic field , and pulse - period parameter space in which they may be observable . in fig .  [ fig : bv ]",
    ", we divide the ns @xmath3-field dipole strength , velocity parameter space , on the basis of these limits :    1 .   @xmath4 . as we find above , this results in a velocity limit ( eq .  [ eq : vlim ] ) , above which the ns is a magac , and",
    "below which the ns is a bondi accretor ( broken line ) .",
    "2 .   _ the propeller phase must be shorter than the age of the galaxy_. we use as a limit ( eq .  [ eq : taup ] ) that @xmath601 yr ( dotted line ) , and also include the line for @xmath601 yr .",
    "this age limit also effectively sets a magnetic field strength limit : nss with @xmath61 g will not spin down in a hubble time .",
    "thus , if magnetic fields in nss decay to @xmath62 g in less than a hubble time , they will not be observed as magacs .",
    "3 .   _ the pulsar must not escape the galaxy_. we adopt an escape speed limit of 700 km s ( cf . ) , although the exact value depends on where in the galaxy the ns is formed .",
    "this limit is indicated by the hashed area at @xmath63700 km s. 4 .",
    "_ the ns magnetic field should not exceed the stability limit .",
    "_ we assume a surface dipole field of @xmath64 g ( ; dashed - dot line ) .",
    "we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : bv ] that acceptable magnetic fields above g , and acceptable velocities range from @xmath725 km s to the escape speed from the galaxy .",
    "we include lines of constant @xmath65 ( for density = 0.1 proton cm ; eq .",
    "[ eq : lacc ] ) ; the luminosities of magacs are between and ( again , assuming free - fall accretion from the magnetosphere onto the ns ) . on the right axis of the figure , we mark @xmath43 , which is independent of velocity , and only weakly dependent upon the density of the ism ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "magacs have @xmath43=0.32.5 kev .",
    "these are harder than observed from any of the identified ionss to date @xcite , perhaps due to an observational bias .",
    "finally , we note that for values of @xmath17 g and @xmath8=400 km s which are not unusual in pulsars , such an object will not accrete via the bondi - mode from the ism , as the magnetic field is in the propeller range .",
    "in addition the source will not spin - down in @xmath62 yr timescale ; so it will wander the galaxy as a dipole - spun down , propelling ns .",
    "[ sec : con ]    strong magnetic field ( @xmath2 g ) nss go through three stages of evolution : ( 1 ) dipole emission ; ( 2 ) propeller slowdown ; and finally , the magac stage ( 3 ) magnetic accretion onto the ns surface .",
    "magacs have the following properties : surface magnetic fields between g up through the ns stability limit ( @xmath7 g ) ; spin periods between  s ; x - ray luminosities  , for a wim density of 0.1 protons cm ; and effective temperatures @xmath43=0.32.5 kev .",
    "the low x - ray luminosities of these sources make it unlikely that the very long spin periods will be detected as pulsations with present x - ray instrumentation , as prohibitively long integrations with frequent monitoring would be required .    at the median velocity for radio pulsars",
    ", magacs will be @xmath67 more luminous than bondi accretors ( for @xmath68 , a typical median velocity for pulsars ; ) . although the birth - rate of magnetars has been estimated to be @xmath710% of isolated pulsars",
    "@xcite , they can be observed to @xmath5510 times the distance and @xmath69 the volume of the galactic disk of bondi accretors at the radio pulsar median velocity .",
    "magnetic accretors , therefore , may be more prevalent in flux limited x - ray catalogs , such as the rosat all - sky - survey / bright source catalog ( rass / bsc ; ) than the lower - magnetic field bondi accretors .",
    "note , however , that popov  @xcite found that the detected rass / bsc inss are more naturally interpreted as soft , young , nearby cooling neutron stars , rather than bondi accretors ; in this interpretation , no nss accreting from the ism have yet been discovered .",
    "the relative number of detectable magacs vs. bondi accretors will ultimately depend on the particulars of the distribution of magnetic fields at birth in nss , the kick velocities ( and their possible dependence on @xmath3 ) , as well as magnetic field decay , which we have neglected herein .      among radio pulsars ,",
    "there are no known objects with implied @xmath3 and @xmath8 which would place them in the magac @xmath70 parameter space .",
    "the strongest @xmath3 field radio pulsar is 5.5 g @xcite , is just below the low-@xmath3 limit ; its velocity is unmeasured . at a velocity of @xmath7 300 km",
    "s , this ns will spin - down on a timescale of @xmath712 yr , much longer than the age of the galaxy .",
    "thus , there are no observed radio pulsars in which the magnetic field is clearly strong enough to evolve into a magac .",
    "this is possibly due to the relatively short timescale that such objects are dipole emitters ( @xmath72 yr ) .",
    "the observed spin periods of magnetars are @xmath731 - 15 sec , which , for the magnetic fields implied ( g ) , are still within the range where electromagnetic dipole radiation will inhibit accretion .",
    "in addition , their x - ray luminosities are a factor 1000 larger than those we expect for magacs .",
    "these objects therefore are not presently magacs ; however , depending on their spatial velocities , they may evolve into magacs .",
    "the ( model dependent ) age of the isolated ns rx  j185635 - 3754 ( @xmath71 my ; ) is shorter than @xmath74 , unless the ns has close to @xmath752 g. with such a high magnetic field , along with the implied velocity ( @xmath55200 km s ) , the source would be within the magac parameter space .",
    "its x - ray luminosity is @xmath552 , which is within a factor of a few of the expected luminosity for a magac with this @xmath3 and @xmath8 .",
    "however , the effective temperature ( @xmath76 kev is substantially below that expected from a magac with @xmath77 ( 2.6 kev ; eq .",
    "[ eq : kteff ] ) .",
    "the spectral hardness seems to rule out this object as a magac for the polar - cap accreting scenario .",
    "since all previously observed inss have effective temperatures @xmath62 200 ev @xcite , it seems similarly unlikely that any known ins is a magac .",
    "it is possible , however , that an interchange instability at the magnetosphere permits accretion over a larger fraction of the ns , which results in a softer spectrum , such as observed here ( ref .",
    "[ eq : diffusion ] ) .",
    "discovering these objects in the rass / bsc requires a similar approach taken in previous work to identify ions  identifying an x - ray source with no apparent optical counterpart , down to an x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of @xmath781000 , with confirmation coming from an optical detection at an appropriate value .",
    "however , magacs can be spectrally harder than their bondi accreting counterparts ( @xmath79 kev ; cf . ) , and searches for these objects must take this into account . also , given their strong magnetic fields , these objects may have a cyclotron _ emission _",
    "line , which may aid identification through x - ray spectroscopy @xcite .",
    "moreover , because we have assumed no magnetic field decay , the absence of magacs in the galaxy , in combination with a population synthesis with high magnetic field sgrs and axps , would support field decay models .",
