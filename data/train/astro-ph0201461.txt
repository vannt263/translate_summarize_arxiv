    "as has long been recognized , accurate locations and rapid follow - up observations in many wavelengths are central to understanding the nature of gamma - ray bursts . for this reason , a strategy evolved in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "1982 ) to detect grbs , not only in gamma - rays , but also in emitted x - rays and optical light .",
    "while detection of short transients at the lower energies posed observational challenges , and the strength of the optical signal was unknown , the possibility of arc minute localizations deduced from the x - rays that were known to be present was very appealing .",
    "this strategy was implemented in the hete-1 ( high energy transient explorer ) satellite , which was unfortunately lost due to a rocket failure on 1996 november 4 , and in the highly successful _",
    "mission ( costa et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the hete-2 satellite ( henceforth simply `` hete '' ) , which was successfully launched into equatorial orbit on 9 october 2000 , is the first space mission entirely devoted to the study of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "hete utilizes a matched suite of low energy x - ray , medium energy x - ray , and gamma - ray detectors mounted on a compact spacecraft .",
    "a unique feature of hete is its capability for localizing grbs with @xmath11 - 10 accuracy in real time aboard the spacecraft .",
    "grb locations are transmitted , within seconds to minutes , directly to a dedicated network of telemetry receivers at 13 automated  burst alert stations \" ( bas ) sited along the satellite ground track ( villasenor et al 2002 ) .",
    "the bas network then re - distributes the grb locations world - wide to all interested observers via internet and the grb coordinates network ( gcn ) in @xmath51 s ( vanderspek et al .",
    "2002 , barthelmy et al .",
    "thus , prompt optical , ir , and radio follow - up identifications can be anticipated for a large fraction of hete grbs .    here",
    "we report the localization of the first hete - discovered50 grbs yr@xmath6 , of which @xmath115 yr@xmath6 are localized by the wxm ( ricker et al .",
    "2002 ) ] grb for which a counterpart has been found .",
    "based on the combined data from hete and the interplanetary network ( ipn ) , a diamond - shaped error box roughly 15 arc minutes on an edge was established for grb010921 .",
    "subsequent searches of this error box by ground - based optical and radio instruments revealed a fading counterpart whose properties are reported elsewhere ( price et al 2001a , 2002 ; kulkarni et al 2002 ; park et al 2001a , 2002 ; djorgovski et al .",
    "the hete spacecraft is a small satellite , measuring roughly a meter high by half a meter in diameter , with a mass of 125 kg . constructed and launched at a cost less than @xmath7 that of a nasa small explorer ( smex ) , hete was primarily developed and fabricated in - house at mit by a small scientific and engineering team , with major hardware and software contributions from international partners in france and japan ( doty et al .",
    "contributions to software development were also made by scientific partners in the us , at the los alamos national laboratory , the university of chicago , and uc - berkeley .",
    "operation of the hete satellite and its science instruments , along with a dedicated tracking and data telemetry network , is carried out by the hete science team itself ( crew et al .",
    "routine activities are largely automated , with oversight and monitoring by members of the science team at mit and at riken .",
    "the gamma - ray burst detection and localization system on hete consists of three complementary instruments : the french gamma - ray telescope ( fregate ) , wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) , and the soft x - ray camera ( sxc ) .",
    "the manner in which the three hete science instruments operate cooperatively is described in ricker et al .",
    "since grb010921 was outside the field - of - view of the sxc , that instrument will not be discussed in this paper .    * french gamma - ray telescope ( fregate ) .",
    "* fregate consists of four , co - aligned cleaved nai(tl ) scintillators .",
    "its prime objectives are the detection and spectroscopy of grbs and the monitoring of variable x - ray sources .",
    "fregate is optimally sensitive in the 6 - 400 kev energy band , and provides limited ( @xmath5 @xmath8 sr ) localization information .",
    "the fregate instrument was developed by centre detude spatiale des rayonnements ( cesr ; toulouse , france ) .",
    "additional details regarding fregate are given in table 4 , and in atteia et al ( 2002 ) .",
    "* wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) . * the wide - field x - ray monitor ( wxm ) consists of two , crossed one - dimensional coded aperture cameras .",
    "the cameras are designated wxm - x and wxm - y , respectively , indicating the spacecraft axis along which each is optimized for grb localization .",
    "two position sensitive proportional counters ( pspc ) are utilized in each camera .",
    "the prime objectives of the wxm are the detection and spectroscopy of grbs and the monitoring of variable x - ray sources in the low energy band .",
    "the wxm is optimally sensitive in the 2 - 25 kev energy band , and typically provides @xmath910 burst localizations .",
    "the wxm was developed by riken(japan ) and the los alamos national laboratory .",
    "additional details regarding the wxm are given in table 4 , and in kawai et al ( 2002 ) and shirasaki et al .",
    "standard hete operations consist of a survey for transient gamma - ray and x - ray events in the 2 - 3 steradians centered on the antisolar point .",
    "observations take place in that half of the hete orbit where the instruments fov is clear of the earth . on september 21 at 18950.56 sod ( 05:15:50.56 ) ut , the fregate instrument on hete detected a bright ( @xmath10 ) grb . in this section",
    "we describe the localization and properties of grb010921 as determined from hete and ipn observations of this burst .",
    "grb010921 was recorded as trigger event h1761 by the fregate instrument on hete , and was promptly reported as a gcn notice at 05:16:08 ut , approximately 17 seconds after the burst .",
    "the burst was also detected at a snr=7.1 in the wxm x detector .",
    "the projection of the burst direction was offset 24 degrees from the wxm x - z plane , resulting in a good ( @xmath1110 ) localization in the x direction and crude limits on y , thereby localizing the source to a thin , long strip .",
    "the projection of the burst direction was offset 39 degrees from the wxm y - z plane , outside the fully - coded fov .",
    "thus , the wxm y camera provided no useful information regarding the y location of the burst .",
    "analysis of the y location required the rapid development and testing by the hete team of non - standard ground analysis software that would rely on the limited wxm x camera data , delaying the dissemination of the two - dimensional localization reported in gcn circular 1096 until approximately 5.1 hours after the grb .",
    "the initial estimate reported in gcn circular 1096 was that the localization strip extended @xmath110@xmath12 in the long direction , and 20@xmath13 in the short direction ( ricker et al 2001a ) .",
    "further refinement of the strip dimensions reduced the wxm error region to a 5.2@xmath14 by 17@xmath13 box , with the 4 corners at coordinates : +   + @xmath15 = 22@xmath1655@xmath1734.7@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 40@xmath142555 + @xmath15 = 22@xmath1654@xmath1705.7@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 40@xmath142642 + @xmath15 = 23@xmath1604@xmath1730.4@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 45@xmath142335 + @xmath15 = 23@xmath1602@xmath1760.0@xmath18 , @xmath19 = 45@xmath142418 + both _",
    "ulysses _ and the gamma - ray burst monitor on _ bepposax _ observed grb010921 , and an initial ipn error box was circulated 15.2 h after the burst ( hurley et al .",
    "triangulation has now been performed using the final data , resulting in a _ ulysses to hete - fregate annulus centered at @xmath15 , @xmath19 = 15@xmath1629@xmath1723.6@xmath18 , 67@xmath123614 , with radius 60.082 @xmath11 0.118 @xmath12 ( 3 @xmath20 ) .",
    "this annulus intersects the 3 @xmath20 wxm error box to give a 310 square arcminute error region whose coordinates are given in table 1 ; the diamond - shaped error region is shown in figure 1 .",
    "this error box is larger than reported in hurley et al .",
    "( 2001 ) due to the fact that the initial wxm error box was quoted for 90% confidence ( ie 2@xmath20 ) .",
    "both the ricker et al .",
    "( 2001a ) 2@xmath20 error region and the 3@xmath20 error region given here are consistent with the position of the optical transient discovered by price et al .",
    "( 2001a ) , with the ot lying 3.6 from the centerline of the wxm error strip , and 3.1 from the centerline of the ipn error annulus .",
    "_      the time history of grb010921 observed by the hete science instruments is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the six panels in figure 2 illustrate the energy dependence of the burst profile and duration . for fregate , all 4 detectors were summed ; for the wxm , only the signal from one illuminated anode ( out of six total ) in the x - camera was utilized , so as to maximize the signal - to - noise ratio , since grb010921 was quite far ( 43 degrees ) off - axis from the instrument boresight .",
    "quantitative measures of the burst temporal properties ( i.e. , @xmath21 and @xmath2 ; paciesas et al .",
    "1999 ) are given in table 2 .",
    "at the highest energies measured by fregate ( 32 - 400 kev band ) , the grb010921 light curve exhibits a high degree of symmetry , with @xmath21=7.4s and @xmath2=21.8s . at lower energies , the @xmath21 duration becomes somewhat larger , increasing by @xmath22 ; on the other hand , @xmath2 is largely unchanged over the 4 - 400 kev band .",
    "overall , the light curve for grb010921 exhibits a hard - to - soft spectral evolution that is common in many grbs .",
    "the prompt emission by grb010921 was measured over more than 2 decades in energy by hete ( table 3 ) .",
    "it is notable that grb010921 s peak energy flux of 2.0 @xmath23 erg @xmath4 s@xmath6 ) in the 4 - 25 kev x - ray band was @xmath1 @xmath7 the peak energy flux in the  traditional \" 50 - 300 kev gamma - ray band .",
    "a comparison of the peak photon flux in the two bands is even more striking : @xmath14 times as many 4 - 25 kev photons were emitted as were 50 - 300 kev photons .",
    "( for grb010921 , the smaller snr in the wxm compared to the snr in fregate arises from the fact that grb010921 was offset 43@xmath14 from the boresight of the wxm . )",
    "the temporal characteristics of grb010921 clearly mark it as belonging to the class of long duration grbs ( hurley 1992 , kouveliotou et al .",
    "it is also quite  x - ray rich , \" in that it exhibits a value of @xmath24/@xmath25 @xmath10.3 .",
    "however , it is by no means deficient in its 50 - 300 kev gamma - ray flux : in fact , its peak flux of 3.6 ph @xmath4 s@xmath6 in the 50 - 300 kev range would place it within the top decile of bursts in the 4br catalog ( paciesias et al 1999 ) .",
    "thus , grb010921 does not qualify as an x - ray flash ( xrf ; heise et al .",
    "2001 ) . based on its apparent redshift of z= 0.450 ( djorgovski et al .",
    "2001 ) , the implied isotropic emitted energy of grb010921 in the 8 - 400 kev band is 7.8 10@xmath26 ergs ( assuming @xmath27=0.3 , @xmath28=0.7 , @xmath29=65 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ; for beamed emission , the total energy should be multiplied by the as - yet - unknown beaming fraction . )",
    "the redshift of grb010921 , the second lowest among established grbs , makes it a strong candidate for extended searches for a possible associated supernova . furthermore , grb010921 was , like all hete - discovered grbs , transiting near midnight at the initial epoch of the burst , resulting in its being well - situated for followup studies by ground - based telescopes for several months following the burst .",
    "thus , additional insight into the nature of grb010921 can be anticipated from long - term optical photometry by large telescopes .",
    "the localization of grb010921 by hete and the ipn has led directly to a successful identification of a low - redshift afterglow counterpart .",
    "the prompt initial gcn alert for grb010921 was distributed worldwide within 17 s of the burst ; however , the determination of the hete wxm localization was delayed by 5.1 hours due to the need to prototype new software to accommodate grb010921 s extreme off - axis position in one of the wxm cameras . a confirmation , and definitive refinement of the wxm localization , using ipn data available 15.2 hours after the grb enabled ground - based observers to successfully target grb010921 during the first night following the burst , and to establish a counterpart well within the hete - ipn error region .",
    "hopefully , over the coming months the identification of optical counterparts resulting from prompt ( @xmath9100 s ) , accurate hete localizations will become routine .",
    "with the currently - projected long orbital lifetime ( @xmath3010 years ) and excellent health of the hete spacecraft and instruments , we look forward to providing a uniquely valuable service to the worldwide community of grb observers .",
    "the combined efforts over almost two decades by many talented and dedicated individuals made the hete mission possible .",
    "in particular , the efforts of bob dill , tye brady , dave breslau , gus comeyne , francis cotin , jim francis , greg huffman , frank larosa , fred miller , jerry roberts , and fuyuki tokanai were particularly notable .    the hete mission is supported in the usa by nasa contract nasw-4690 ; in japan , in part by the ministry of education , culture , sports , science , and technology grant - in - aid 13440063 .",
