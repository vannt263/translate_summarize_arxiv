    "classification and clustering have received considerable attention in the statistical literature . in this article , a graph - based approach for testing bivariate spatial clustering patterns",
    "is introduced .",
    "the analysis of spatial point patterns in natural populations has been extensively studied and have important implications in epidemiology , population biology , and ecology .",
    "the patterns of points from one class with respect to points from other classes , rather than the pattern of points from one - class with respect to the ground , are investigated .",
    "the spatial relationships among two or more classes have important implications especially for plant species .",
    "see , for example , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the goal of this article is to derive the asymptotic distribution of the relative edge density of underlying graphs based on a particular digraph family and use it to test the spatial pattern of complete spatial randomness against spatial segregation or association .",
    "complete spatial randomness ( csr ) is roughly defined as the lack of spatial interaction between the points in a given study area .",
    "segregation is the pattern in which points of one class tend to cluster together , i.e. , form one - class clumps . in association , the points of one class tend to occur more frequently around points from the other class . for convenience and generality",
    ", we call the different types of points  classes \" , but the class can be replaced by any characteristic of an observation at a particular location . for example , the pattern of spatial segregation has been investigated for plant species ( diggle 1983 ) , age classes of plants ( @xcite ) and sexes of dioecious plants ( @xcite ) .    in recent years , the use of mathematical graphs has also gained popularity in spatial analysis ( @xcite ) . in spatial pattern analysis graph theoretic tools provide a way to move beyond euclidean metrics for spatial analysis . for example , graph - based approaches have been proposed to determine paths among habitats at various scales and dispersal movement distances , and balance data requirements with information content ( @xcite ) .",
    "although only recently introduced to landscape ecology , graph theory is well suited to ecological applications concerned with connectivity or movement ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , conventional graphs do not explicitly maintain geographic reference , reducing utility of other geo - spatial information .",
    "@xcite introduce spatial graphs that integrate a geometric reference system that ties patches and paths to specific spatial locations and spatial dimensions thereby preserving the relevant spatial information .",
    "after a graph is constructed using spatial data , usually the scale is lost ( see for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "many concepts in spatial ecology depend on the idea of spatial adjacency which requires information on the close vicinity of an object .",
    "graph theory conveniently can be used to express and communicate adjacency information allowing one to compute meaningful quantities related to spatial point pattern . adding vertex and edge properties to graphs extends the problem domain to network modeling ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite propose a new measure based on graph theory and spatial interaction , which reflects intra - patch and inter - patch relationships by quantifying contiguity within patches and potential contiguity among patches .",
    "@xcite also propose a graph - theoretic method to measure multivariate association , but their method is not designed to analyze spatial interaction between two or more classes ; instead it is an extension of generalized correlation coefficient ( such as spearman s @xmath1 or kendall s @xmath2 ) to measure multivariate ( possibly nonlinear ) correlation .",
    "a new type of spatial clustering test using directed graphs ( i.e. , digraphs ) which is based on the relative positions of the data points from various classes has also been developed recently .",
    "data - random digraphs are directed graphs in which each vertex corresponds to a data point , and directed edges ( i.e. , arcs ) are defined in terms of some bivariate function on the data .",
    "for example , nearest neighbor digraphs are defined by placing an arc between each vertex and its nearest neighbor .",
    "@xcite introduced the class cover catch digraphs ( cccds ) in @xmath3 and gave the exact and the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the cccds .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite applied the concept in higher dimensions and demonstrated relatively good performance of cccds in classification .",
    "their methods involve _ data reduction _",
    "( i.e. , _ condensing _ ) by using approximate minimum dominating sets as _ prototype sets _ ( since finding the exact minimum dominating set is an np - hard problem in general  e.g. , for cccd in multiple dimensions  ( see @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore the exact and the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of the cccds are not analytically tractable in multiple dimensions . for the domination number of cccds for one - dimensional data ,",
    "a slln result is proved in @xcite , and this result is extended by @xcite ; furthermore , a generalized slln result is provided by @xcite , and a clt is also proved by @xcite .",
    "the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of cccds for non - uniform data in @xmath4 is also calculated in a rather general setting ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite generalized cccds to what is called _ proximity catch digraphs _ ( pcds ) .",
    "the first pcd family is introduced by @xcite ; the parametrized version of this pcd is developed by @xcite where the relative arc density of the pcd is calculated and used for spatial pattern analysis .",
    "@xcite introduced another digraph family called _ proportional edge pcds _ and calculated the asymptotic distribution of its domination number and used it for the same purpose . the relative arc density of this pcd family is also computed and used in spatial pattern analysis ( @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "derived the asymptotic distribution of the domination number of proportional - edge pcds for two - dimensional uniform data .",
    "the underlying graphs based on digraphs are obtained by replacing arcs in the digraph by edges based on bivariate relations . if symmetric arcs are replaced by edges",
    ", then we obtain the and - underlying graph ; and if all arcs are replaced by edges without allowing multi - edges , then we obtain the or - underlying graph .",
    "the statistical tool utilized in this article is the asymptotic theory of @xmath0-statistics .",
    "properly scaled , we demonstrate that the relative edge density of the underlying graphs of proportional - edge pcds is a @xmath0-statistic , which has asymptotic normality by the general central limit theory of @xmath0-statistics .",
    "for the digraphs introduced by @xcite , whose relative arc density is also of the @xmath0-statistic form , the asymptotic mean and variance of the relative density is not analytically tractable , due to geometric difficulties encountered .",
    "however , for the pcds introduced in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the relative arc density has tractable asymptotic mean and variance .",
    "we define the underlying graphs of proportional - edge pcds and their relative edge density in section [ sec : underlying ] , provide the asymptotic distribution of the relative edge density under the null hypothesis in section [ sec : null - dist - edge - density ] , and describe the alternatives of segregation and association in section [ sec : alt - seg - assoc ] .",
    "we prove the consistency of the relative edge density in section [ sec : consistency ] , and provide pitman asymptotic efficiency in section [ sec : pae ] .",
    "we present the monte carlo simulation analysis for finite sample performance in section [ sec : monte - carlo ] , in particular , provide the monte carlo power analysis under segregation in section [ sec : power - seg ] , and under association in section [ sec : power - assoc ] .",
    "we treat the multiple triangle case in section [ sec : multiple - triangle - case ] , provide extension to higher dimensions in section [ sec : extend - high - dim ] .",
    "we provide the discussion and conclusions in section [ sec : discussion ] , and the tedious calculations and long proofs are deferred to the appendix .",
    "the main difference between a graph and a digraph is that edges are directed in digraphs , hence are called arcs .",
    "so the arcs are denoted as ordered pairs while edges are denoted as unordered pairs .",
    "the _ underlying graph _ of a digraph is the graph obtained by replacing each arc @xmath5 or each symmetric arc , @xmath6 by the edge @xmath7 .",
    "the former underlying graph will be referred as the _ or - underlying graph _ , while the latter as the _ and - underlying graph_. that is , the and - underlying graph for digraph @xmath8 is the graph @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the set of edges such that @xmath11 iff @xmath5 _ and _ @xmath12 .",

    "thus @xmath18 represents the ratio of the number of edges in the graph @xmath21 to the number of edges in the complete graph of order @xmath22 , which is @xmath23 .",
    "let @xmath24 be a measurable space and consider @xmath25 , where @xmath26 represents the power set functional .",

    "there are many types of parametrizations for the alternatives .",
    "the particular parametrization of the alternatives in this article is chosen so that the distribution of the relative edge density under the alternatives would be geometry invariant ( i.e. , independent of the geometry of the support triangles ) .",
    "the more natural alternatives ( i.e. , the alternatives that are more likely to be found in practice ) can be similar to or might be approximated by our parametrization . because in any segregation alternative , the @xmath611 points will tend to be further away from @xmath612 points and in any association alternative @xmath611 points will tend to cluster around the @xmath612 points . and such patterns can be detected by the test statistics based on the relative edge density , since under segregation ( whether it is parametrized as in section [ sec : alt - seg - assoc ] or not ) we expect them to be larger , and under association ( regardless of the parametrization ) they tend to be smaller .",
