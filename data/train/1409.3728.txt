    "since the foundation of ads / cft correspondence @xcite , various properties of the anti de sitter ( ads ) space become big interests of us .",
    "ads has a gravitationally attractive property via a cosmological constant @xmath0 and hence it gives somehow non - intuitive phenomena .",
    "for example , intuitively a hill - top of a tachyonic potential implies a unstable equilibrium and it might be destabilized by a small perturbation ; on the other hand , because of the attractive property of the ads space , a tachyonic top of ads can be stable up to perturbations , as long as the mass scale @xmath1 of the tachyonic top is smaller than a critical value : @xmath2 . this condition is known by the breitenlohner - freedman ( bf ) bound @xcite .",
    "then the next natural question is this : if the mass scale of the tachyonic top is smaller than the bf bound , then can the tachyonic top be destabilized via _ non - perturbative effects _ ?",
    "this question can be refined as follows :    * for which conditions , is the tachyonic top stable or unstable ?",
    "* is there a non - perturbative instanton around a tachyonic top",
    "? if there is , for which conditions ? * if there is a non - perturbative instanton , does it mean the destabilization of the tachyonic top ?",
    "if it does not mean the destabilization , then what does this mean ?",
    "for the first question , there is literature in terms of the energy of the ads background @xcite .",
    "if the trivial ads is the absolute minimum of possible energy variations , then for any modification of the configuration space , the ads background should be stable .",
    "although we can not classify all possible stable potentials , at least we can give a definite example .",
    "for the second question , we know that there exists a potential that allows a non - perturbative and non - trivial instanton solution around the tachyonic top @xcite . however , it is still unclear whether the instanton means a destabilization of the tachyonic top or not .    regarding the third question ,",
    "our strategy is _ to compare with ds instantons_. there is a deep relation between a tachyonic top of ads and a stable local minimum of ds @xcite .",
    "more specifically , for a tachyonic potential in ads with @xmath3 , @xmath4 connect the model from tachyonic ads to stable ds , where @xmath5 is the scale factor of ads and @xmath6 is the scale factor of ds . we will discuss more details and justifications in the following sections .",
    "anyway , this correspondence between ads and ds implies that , _ if there is an instanton in ds , then there should be a corresponding instanton in ads_. one more interesting correspondence is that if the mass scale becomes sufficiently larger than the bf bound , then there is no classicalized instanton around the local minimum of ds @xcite ; while the tachyonic top is unstable up to small perturbations around the local maximum of ads .",
    "so to speak , _ if there is no instanton in ds , then ( corresponding ) ads is no more stable .",
    "_ this is surely more than an accident .",
    "keeping this in mind , let us summarize the basic properties of instantons around the local minimum of ds @xcite .",
    "* instantons are basically _ fuzzy _ , in the sense that solutions are complex - valued ( the only real - valued instanton is the hawking - moss instanton around the local minimum or maximum @xcite ) . of course ,",
    "after the wick rotation , the solutions approach real values in order to satisfy classicality @xcite . *",
    "instantons are _ continuous _ around the local minimum @xcite .",
    "this gives a positive dispersion of the scalar field around the local minimum @xcite , where this is consistent with a different approach @xcite .",
    "* we interpret that this dispersion is due to the _ thermal / quantum fluctuations_. the positive dispersion is a kind of stationary field distribution via quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "however , this does _ not _ correspond to the bounce solution , such as coleman - deluccia instantons @xcite , that destabilizes the local minimum . *",
    "this dispersion can be observed by only the omnipotent observer who can see all histories in superspace , while semi - classical observers can not see the dispersion of the field @xcite .",
    "so , if there is a correspondence between ads and ds instantons , then can we say that ( a ) ads instantons are complex - valued , ( b ) instantons are continuous around the tachyonic top , ( c ) they do not destabilize the tachyonic top , and ( d ) no observer can see the positive dispersion ?",
    "in conclusion , we will say yes for ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) , while say no for ( d ) . of course , we will refine and clarify the statements in the following sections .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : qua ] , we discuss motivations regarding this problem . for many cases ,",
    "instantons around the tachyonic top will have diverging action , while this seems to be strange in some points .",
    "first , we clarify this problem . in sec .",
    "[ sec : nob ] , we discuss on the no - boundary regulator to deal with this problem .",
    "the introduction of the no - boundary regulator indeed covers various issues those were discussed in this introduction . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] , we summarize our results and discuss on future directions .",
    "let us first investigate euclidean instantons of a tachyonic hill - top potential in ads space .",
    "we can show that there exist instantons like thick - shell , but their euclidean actions diverge except the case when we finely tune the potential .",
    "we briefly review on this issue .",
    "we consider the following model in euclidean signatures : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the ricci scalar , @xmath9 is a scalar field , @xmath3 is a potential of @xmath9 such as @xmath10 with @xmath11 .",
    "this describes a tachyonic top in ads .    to investigate instantons , we impose @xmath12 symmetric metric ansatz : @xmath13 where @xmath14 .",
    "then the equations of motion are as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath17    in this case , the decay probability is @xmath18 where @xmath19 . in general , the euclidean actions for solution and background diverge in ads , but the subtracted result can be finite .",
    "let us check how to subtract and for which conditions the decay rate can have non - zero probability .",
    "left : some solutions for @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ( black ) , @xmath23 ( blue ) , @xmath24 ( red ) ) .",
    "right : the lagrangian @xmath25 for each solutions and the background ads solution ( gray).,title=\"fig : \" ] left : some solutions for @xmath20 with @xmath21 ( @xmath22 ( black ) , @xmath23 ( blue ) , @xmath24 ( red ) ) .",
    "right : the lagrangian @xmath25 for each solutions and the background ads solution ( gray).,title=\"fig : \" ]    upper : the euclidean action of the instanton is the integral over the green colored region and the red colored region .",
    "lower : the euclidean action of the background is the integral over the blue colored region and the red colored region .",
    "both of red colored region would be canceled by the subtraction . ]",
    "[ fig : phi2_2 ] demonstrates some numerical examples of this kind of solutions .",
    "as @xmath9 approaches to the top ( @xmath26 ) , the solution approaches ads and this phenomenon is universal , in the sense that the log of the euclidean lagrangian linearly increases with the same gradient .",
    "then we can match the anti de sitter background and try to subtract the background contributions , similar to the thin - shell cases .",
    "[ fig : concept ] gives the conceptual picture .",
    "upper means the lagrangian of the euclidean instanton solution .",
    "the euclidean action is the integral over the green colored region and the red colored region ( of course , the picture is a log of the lagrangian and hence we have to consider the correct exponential factor ) , where the green colored region has @xmath27 and hence corresponds the thick - wall region and the red colored region has @xmath26 and hence very similar as the ads background .",
    "lower means the lagrangian of the pure ads background .",
    "the euclidean action is the integral over the blue colored region and the red colored region , where we choose the time slice between the blue colored region and the red colored region @xmath28 to have the same lagrangian value .",
    "therefore , intuitively , the subtraction between the upper ( instanton ) and the lower ( background ) will give finite results because the red colored regions of upper and lower should be canceled .",
    "however , in terms of detailed calculations , this intuitive explanation does not hold in general .",
    "we see the details in the following subsections .      in this subsection",
    ", we assume @xmath29 without loss of generality . around the local maximum ,",
    "it is approximately pure euclidean ads such that @xmath30 and hence @xmath31 where @xmath32 .",
    "now we can write the equation for the scalar field as follows : @xmath33 for @xmath34 , we further approximate @xmath35 therefore , if @xmath36 ( i.e. , satisfies the bf bound ) , then @xmath37 + a_{2 } \\exp \\left [ \\left(- \\frac{3}{2}h_{0 } - \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}h^{2}_{0 } - \\mu^{2}}\\right ) \\tau \\right ] \\label{eq : noapp}\\\\ & \\simeq & a_{1 } \\exp \\left [ \\left(- \\frac{3}{2}h_{0 } + \\sqrt{\\frac{9}{4}h^{2}_{0 } - \\mu^{2}}\\right ) \\tau \\right ] , \\label{eq : app}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence approaches to local maximum without oscillation .",
    "note that the approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) is valid for the case when @xmath38 is not zero .",
    "of course , @xmath38 can be zero , but it depends on the initial conditions . in our instanton solutions , we already fixed the initial conditions except the field amplitude . as the field approaches to the local maximum of the potential",
    ", the approaching speed can be controlled if we tune the shape of the potential ; then by tuning the initial field value , we may be able to obtain suitable @xmath38 .",
    "this means that unless we finely tune the shape of the potential , in general @xmath38 is non - zero , and hence the approximation to eq .",
    "( [ eq : app ] ) should be valid type potential @xcite , near the local maximum the effective mass @xmath39 becomes zero .",
    "therefore , if we can sure that the overall amplitude emerges to the local maximum as @xmath40 increases , then we can sure that @xmath38 is zero for this @xmath41 potential case .",
    "we investigate instantons around the @xmath41 potential in @xcite . ] .",
    "let us compare to the convergence condition of kanno , sasaki and soda @xcite ; we introduce their results without further derivation . in the paper",
    ", they used the conformal coordinate : @xmath42 noted that , around the boundary ( @xmath43 and @xmath44 ) , the solution should behave @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 is the mass parameter at the bf bound .",
    "if we rewrite @xmath48 , then @xmath49 in addition , @xmath50 therefore , @xmath51 } + ... \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] is obtained .",
    "note that @xmath52 or @xmath53 is the condition that has a non - zero decay rate , while @xmath52 is unphysical in the sense that the energy diverges @xcite .",
    "if @xmath54 , then we should choose the upper sign , i.e. , for the non - zero decay rate , the solution should follow the fast - decay mode .    to summarize , unless @xmath38 of eq .",
    "( [ eq : noapp ] ) is zero , the euclidean action around the tachyonic top in ads diverges .",
    "that is the reason why authors of @xcite had to tune the potential to obtain an instanton with a non - zero decay rate .",
    "therefore , for the tachyonic @xmath55 potential , there is no euclidean instanton that has a non - zero decay rate .",
    "let us discuss motivations for further investigations .",
    "first , there is a conceptual tension between our intuitive understanding of solutions in ads space ( sec .",
    "[ sec : insta ] ) and analytic calculations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : condi ] ) .",
    "this tension is related to the fact as follows : ads is contracting in lorentzian signatures and hence its physical volume is effectively bounded by @xmath56 , while it has infinite volume in euclidean signatures and has infinite entropy ( or , entropy is not well - defined ) . on the other hand , ds is expanding in lorentzian signatures and hence its physical volume is unbounded ( again , volume of ds is not well - defined ) ; while it has a finite volume ( again , order of @xmath57 ) in euclidean signatures and hence has finite entropy . in this sense , if any quantum effect in ads is disallowed because of very far effects ( e.g. , @xmath58 ) , then it seems quite strange in terms of lorentzian observer s point of view . for ds cases",
    ", the euclidean treatment gives an effective cutoffs @xcite so that any observables to be finite .",
    "can the euclidean approach allow a similar treatment for ads ?",
    "second , we can find an example of potentials that the subtracted euclidean action can be finite @xcite .",
    "however , if we slightly tilt the potential , then the slow - decay mode would be turned on and hence the subtracted action will diverge again .",
    "however , the real physics ( existence of instantons ) should not seriously affected by a very small tilt of the potential and hopefully we should explain their continuous variations .    these may indicate that there will be some treatment such that even though a solution does not satisfy the non - zero decay rate condition ( of sec .",
    "[ sec : condi ] ) , it still has physical meaning . in this paper , we assert that the no - boundary regulator , that was introduced by hartle and hertog @xcite , will do a proper role for this purpose .",
    "in this section , we first reformulate euclidean quantum gravity for ds background and second recover the conventions of the previous section to introduce the no - boundary regulator for ads .      the wave function of universe or the ground state wave function of the universe @xcite is @xmath59 = \\int \\mathcal{d}g\\mathcal{d}\\phi\\;\\ ; e^{-s_{\\mathrm{e}}\\left[g_{\\mu\\nu } , \\phi\\right]},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the euclidean action is @xmath60 now we keep in mind the ds space with the potential @xmath61 and we sum - over all regular and compact geometries those have the only boundary @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",

    "we use the steepest - descent method and consider only the on - shell solutions to count the probability from the path - integral .",
    "we solve the following classical equations of motion for the euclidean time direction @xmath73 where the initial conditions of the south pole is @xmath74 then the on - shell euclidean action is given by @xmath75 when @xmath6 and @xmath9 approach to real values , the real part of the euclidean action slowly varies than that of the imaginary part : @xmath76 where @xmath77 . if this condition is satisfied , then the probability of the history is well - defined and can be estimated by @xmath78 here , we introduce the factor two because the integration is up to the half of the manifold ; in any case , the result should be consistent with that of the previous section .",
    "upper : two possible contours .",
    "lower left : the red contour can be interpreted as a homogeneous ds space .",
    "lower right : the blue contour can be interpreted as an inhomogeneous ads space . ]      for a time contour @xmath68 , if the end point satisfies the classicality conditions , then the probability is well - defined and it does not depend on the choice of @xmath68 .",
    "we regard that a contour is labeled by the time parameter @xmath79 , where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are real .",
    "we label the south pole by @xmath82 and the end point by @xmath83 .",
    "we illustrate two different ways and their analytic continuations to the lorentzian manifold ( fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] , see also @xcite ) . regarding the choice of different contours , see also @xcite .",
    "first , we begin from @xmath84 and follow the real axis of @xmath40 until @xmath85 ; then move @xmath86 until @xmath87 ( following red contour in fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] ) .",
    "then , the wick rotation to @xmath81 direction naturally makes that the instanton follows along the lorentzian signatures .",
    "therefore , this explains the creation of homogeneous ds universe ( lower left of fig .",
    "[ fig : path ] ) .",
    "if @xmath88 ( this is the same as the bf bound in ads ) , then there is a continuous spectrum of the classicalized instantons @xcite and the probability @xmath89 will be approximately @xmath90 where the initial condition of the scalar field is @xmath91 with real valued constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "( in fact , to satisfy the classicality , we have to tune @xmath94 and @xmath93 ; hence , the only dynamical degrees of freedom of @xmath89 is the one dimensional field modulus @xmath92 . )",

    "therefore , along the @xmath100 axis , @xmath101 should be dominated by the imaginary parts .",

    ". therefore , this means that along the @xmath100 line , the solution behaves as the euclidean ads with the potential @xmath106 where @xmath107 .    if @xmath108 , then @xmath109 forms a complete euclidean ads and the contribution for @xmath96 only locates on the boundary of the euclidean ads . for the @xmath100 slice",
    ", we can wick rotate to the lorentzian signature by @xmath110 .",
    "this explains a creation of an inhomogeneous ads universe ( lower right of fig .  [",

    "this is similar to the case of ds ; these come from quantum / thermal fluctuations or excitations ( not the bounce that destabilizes a local minimum ) and quantum / thermal fluctuations _ can _ destabilize but _ do not necessarily _ mean the destabilization .",

    "this further implies that the asymptotic observer ( even semi - classical observer ) may notice the uncertainty of the scalar field , i.e. , the fuzzy ( orbital - like ) field / metric distribution via quantum fluctuations .",
    "this uncertainty can be seen by only an ads boundary observer and not by a ds observer .",
    "of course , the decisive interpretation on the unclassicalized solution is still difficult .",
    "this means that we are dealing with a genuinely quantum gravitational phenomenon .",
    "so , further investigations are necessary .",
    "in this paper , we revisited the quantum stability issue around the tachyonic top in ads .",
    "if the mass scale is smaller than the bf bound , then it is perturbatively stable .",
    "we introduced the no - boundary regulator , and this makes a continuous instanton spectrum around the tachyonic top , while these instantons may not destabilize the equilibrium ; rather these mean quantum / thermal fluctuations .",
    "one interesting observation is on the interpretation of the positive dispersion of the scalar field . for the ds case ,",
    "each instanton is classicalized and hence a semi - classical observer can not see the dispersion . on the other hand , for the ads case , each instanton can not be classicalized and hence the boundary semi - classical observer may see the dispersion of the scalar field .",
    "then what does it look like ?",
    "what is the thing that the asymptotic ads observer sees ?",
    "this goes beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "however , what we can say is that due to the quantum fluctuation of the scalar field , perhaps the scalar field is uncertain and the metric is not classical ; therefore , due to quantum fluctuations , general relativity seems to be effectively broken , in the sense that when the metric is not classicalized , the metric does not satisfy classical equations of motion , while general relativity is a kind of classical equations of motion . to summarize",
    ", if we believe that ads is unitary , then it seems that such unitary quantum effects may induce the violation of classical equations of motion .    of course",
    ", it is fair to say that this is a brave interpretation at this stage .",
    "however , if it is the case , can this resolve the contradiction between unitary quantum field theory and general relativity in the context of black hole complementarity controversy @xcite ?",
    "in addition , the non - zero dispersion may be interpreted in the context of the uncertainty principle @xcite though it requires further justifications .",
    "still this paper can not cover black hole physics , but it gives some intuitions of ads .",
    "further study of euclidean quantum gravity and the information loss problem @xcite can be an interesting topic for future study .",
