    "as hetnet provides flexible and efficient topology to boost spectral efficiency , it has recently aroused immense interest in both academia and industry . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hetnet_2tiers ] , a hetnet consists of a diverse set of regular macro base stations ( bs ) overlaid with low power pico bss .",
    "since this overlaid structure may lead to severe interference problem , it is extremely critical to control interference via rrm in hetnet .",
    "there has been much research conducted on rrm optimization for traditional cellular networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors considered power and user scheduling in single - carrier cellular networks . in @xcite ,",
    "the game theoretical approaches are proposed for distributed resource allocation . in @xcite , the authors proposed a dynamic fractional frequency reuse scheme to combat the inter - sector interference under a game - based optimization by each sector .",
    "the coordinated multipoint transmission ( comp ) @xcite is another important technique to handle the inter - cell interference .",
    "for example , in @xcite , the authors exploited the uplink - downlink duality to do joint optimization of power allocation and beamforming vectors . in @xcite ,",
    "a wmmse algorithm is proposed to find a stationary point of the weighted sum - rate maximization problem for multi - cell downlink systems .",
    "while the above algorithms achieve comparably good performance , they require global channel state information ( csi ) for centralized implementation @xcite or over - the - air iterations and global message passing for distributed implementation @xcite .",
    "it is quite controversial whether comp is effective or not in lte systems due to large signaling overhead , signaling latency , inaccurate csit , and the complexity of the algorithm .    on the other hand ,",
    "solutions for traditional cellular networks can not be applied directly to hetnet due to the unique difference in hetnet topology .",
    "first , the inter - cell interference in hetnet is more complicated , e.g. , there is _ co - tier interference _ among the pico bss and among the macro bss as well as the _ cross - tier interference _ between the macro and pico bss .",
    "furthermore , due to load balancing , some of the mobiles in hetnet may be assigned to a pico bs which is not the strongest bs @xcite and the mobiles in the pico cell may suffer from strong interference from the macro bss . to solve these problems , some eicic techniques , such as the abs control @xcite ,",
    "have been proposed in lte and lte - a @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors analyzed the performance for abs in hetnet under different cell range extension ( re ) biases .",
    "however , they focused on numerical analysis for the existing heuristic eicic schemes , which are the baselines of this paper .",
    "in @xcite , the authors proposed an algorithm for victim pico user partition and optimal synchronous abs rate selection .",
    "however , they used a universal abs rate for the whole network , and as a result , their scheme could not adapt to dynamic network loading for different macro cells .    in this paper , we focus on the resource optimization in the downlink of a hetnet without comp .",
    "we consider _ dynamic abrb _ for interference control and dynamic user scheduling to exploit _ multi - user diversity_. the abrb is similar to the abs but it is scheduled over both time and frequency domain .",
    "unlike @xcite , we do not restrict the abrb rate to be the same for all macro bss and thus a better performance can be achieved .",
    "however , this also causes several new technical challenges as elaborated below .    * * exponential complexity for dynamic abrb : * optimization of abrb patterns is challenging due to the combinatorial nature and exponentially large solution space .",
    "for example , in a hetnet with @xmath0 macro bss , there are @xmath1 different abrb pattern combinations . hence , brute force solutions are highly undesirable . * * complex interactions between dynamic user scheduling and dynamic abrb * : there is complex coupling between the dynamic user scheduling and abrb control .",
    "for instance , the abrb pattern will affect the user sets eligible for user scheduling .",
    "furthermore , the optimization objective of abrb control depends on user scheduling policy and there is no closed form characterization . * * challenges in rrm architecture : * most existing solutions for resource optimization of hetnet requires global knowledge of csi and centralized implementations . yet ,",
    "such designs are not scalable for large networks and they are not robust with respect to ( w.r.t . )",
    "latency in backhaul .    to address the above challenges ,",
    "we propose a two timescale control structure where the long term controls , such as dynamic abrb , are adaptive to the large scale fading . on the other hand ,",
    "the short term control , such as the user scheduling , is adaptive to the local csi within a pico / macro bs .",
    "such a multi - timescale structure allows _ hierarchical rrm _ design , where the long term control decisions can be implemented on a rrm server for inter - cell interference coordination .",
    "the short - term control decisions can be done locally at each bs with only local csi .",
    "such design has the advantages of low signaling overhead , good scalability , and robustness w.r.t .",
    "latency of backhaul signaling . while there are previous works on two timescale rrm @xcite , those approaches are heuristic ( i.e. the rrm algorithms are not coming from a single optimization problem ) .",
    "our contribution in this paper is a formal study of two timescale rrm algorithms for hetnet based on optimization theory . to overcome the exponential complexity for abrb control",
    ", we exploit the sparsity in the _ interference graph _ of the hetnet topology and derive structural properties for the optimal abrb control .",
    "based on that , we propose a _ two timescale alternative optimization _",
