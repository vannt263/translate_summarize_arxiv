    "soft gamma - ray repeaters ( sgr ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axp ) are believed to be magnetars , which are extremely strongly magnetized , slowly rotating neutron stars with a rotation period @xmath0 and a magnetic field well exceeding the quantum electrodynamic ( qed ) critical field , @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "both sgr and axp emit persistent thermal x - rays modulated by magnetar s rotation , with a luminosity much higher than their spin - down power , suggesting that the emission is powered by the magnetic energy not the rotation energy  @xcite .",
    "sgrs emit bursts of soft gamma - rays ( or x - rays ) as well as persistent , pulsed x - rays @xcite .",
    "although the prominent feature of axps is their persistent x - rays , at least one of them has been detected to have sgr - like burst emission  @xcite .",
    "it is generally thought that radiation processes in magnetars are predominantly driven by magnetic field decay in the neutron star s interior or crustal region , either through direct internal heating as the result of a dissipation process or through damping of waves that are excited by the release of the magnetic stress  @xcite .",
    "this latter mechanism is considered here since no efficient internal dissipation has been identified so far . an enormous magnetic stress built up in the crust as the result of the magnetic transport processes in the star causes crustal dislocations or disturbances ( e.g. shear waves ) that excite fast - mode and alfvn waves transferring a significant fraction of the magnetic energy to the magnetar magnetosphere @xcite . since low - frequency fast - mode waves or alfvn waves generated in a superstrongly magnetized plasma are subject to negligible damping , they must undergo a cascade through wave - wave interactions .",
    "@xcite discussed that fast - mode waves may steepen and breakdown leading to dissipation of wave energy .",
    "we consider here that shear waves propagate in a horizontal direction in the crust region and that mode coupling produces predominantly alfvn waves .",
    "cascades of alfvn waves through three - wave interactions from smaller to larger wave numbers were discussed extensively in the context of the ism turbulence @xcite .",
    "this idea was extended to the case of a superstrong magnetic field and it was suggested as an important channel for dissipation of alfvn waves in the magnetar magnetosphere  @xcite . despite the extensive discussions in both the contexts of the ism and magnetar , the specific dissipation mechanism is not well understood .",
    "three - wave interactions in the incompressible mhd approximation lead to anisotropic turbulence with the cascade in parallel ( to the magnetic field ) wavenumber suppressed  @xcite , while wave damping through kinetic processes is possible only when a cascade to large parallel wavenumbers occurs .",
    "although three - wave interactions involving the fast mode allow cascades in both parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers , these processes are important only below a critical frequency @xcite .    in this paper , decay of alfvn waves through three - wave interactions into damping ion sound waves",
    "is considered as a possible dissipation mechanism in the magnetar magnetosphere .",
    "decay of an alfvn wave into the ion sound mode and a backward propagating alfvn wave was suggested by @xcite and discussed widely in terms of parametric or modulational instability with the application to solar flares or the solar wind @xcite . in general ,",
    "when density fluctuations are allowed , a pump wave ( not necessary in a natural mode ) decays into two side - band plus a density modulation . in the low @xmath2 limit , where @xmath3 is the ion sound",
    "speed and @xmath4 is the alfvn speed , one side - band is in the alfvn mode and the density fluctuations are in the ion sound mode .",
    "the other side - band is not in a natural mode and thus , it is not important .",
    "this process reduces to three - wave decay @xcite , with the growth rate for the instability ( for the side band ) being the most effective in the low @xmath2 limit .",
    "however , since one has a typical @xmath5 in solar flares and @xmath6 in the solar wind , its applicability is limited .",
    "here it is suggested that such process may be efficient in magnetars where we have @xmath7 .",
    "since the presence of a propagating ion sound wave requires nonequibrilium between electron temperature and ion temperature , a condition which is generally not satisfied for magnetars , the sound mode can be treated as a quasimode @xcite and an alfvn wave can decay into an alfvn wave propagating in the opposite direction and an ion sound wave that is instantaneously damped .",
    "this process leads to conversion of the energy in the incoming wave to thermal kinetic energy in the plasma .",
    "it is proposed here that plasma heating through such process leads to x - ray emission .    in sec .",
    "2 , theory for generation of alfvn waves is outlined and decay of alfvn waves through three - wave interactions involving ion sound waves is discussed in sec .",
    "3 . a model for thermal x - ray emission due to dissipation of these waves in magnetars",
    "is discussed in sec .",
    "magnetic transport in the neutron star can lead to magnetic stress being built up in the crust which causes fractures or dislocations in the crust .",
    "such events generate disturbances propagating , for example as shear waves that can couple to the alfvn wave in the magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "although shear waves can couple to both the alfvn mode and fast mode , here we discuss only the former where the transmitted energy is assumed to be mainly in the alfvn mode .",
    "one may treat the star s surface as a sharp boundary , a reasonable approximation because the scale height of the star s atmosphere is about a few cm , much less than the relevant wavelength .",
    "the typical frequency of shear waves in the crust can be estimated from @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the typical length scale of the displacement of crust movement , @xmath10 is the shear velocity , @xmath11 is the shear modulus , and @xmath12 is the crust density .    when the surface is treated as a sharp boundary , snell s law implies that @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are wave number and incident angle ( relative to the surface norm ) of the shear wave , and @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the corresponding wave number and incident angle of the transmitted alfvn wave . since the dispersion of the alfvn mode can be written as @xmath18 , where @xmath19 , the propagation angle can be determined from @xmath20 . in the magnetar s strong magnetic field , one has the limit @xmath21 and this implies that @xmath22 . using @xmath23 , where the phase speed of the shear wave is assumed to be @xmath24 , one obtains @xmath25 .",
    "thus , the transmitted alfvn wave propagates nearly perpendicular to the magnetic field at @xmath26 ( as shown in figure [ fig : alfv ] ) .",
    "the mode coupling ( to alfvn waves ) is efficient only in the surface area where the magnetic field lines have an angle @xmath27 with respect to the surface normal direction .    .",
    "note that near the surface the propagation of the alfvn mode is mostly perpendicular , with @xmath28 .",
    ", width=283 ]    a relevant issue here is how the alfvn waves dissipate in the magnetosphere .",
    "the landau damping rate is proportional to @xmath29 , which is negligible for the frequency @xmath30 being much lower than the ion cyclotron frequency @xmath31 . in the absence of direct damping processes ,",
    "the alfvn waves must undergo cascades through three - wave interactions .",
    "a widely discussed process is the three - wave interaction involving three alfvn waves ( denoted by @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath33 ) : @xmath34 or @xmath35 .",
    "although a cascade in @xmath36 is possible in principle in the presence of a natural broadening in the three - wave resonance , the cascade occurs predominantly in @xmath37 leading to anisotropic alfvnic turbulence @xcite .",
    "the alfvn mode can be converted to a mixture of alfvn and fast - mode ( @xmath38 ) waves through @xmath39 . compared to pure alfvnic turbulence ,",
    "three - wave processes involving the fast mode are more efficient for frequency below a critical frequency @xmath40 ( corresponding to a critical wavelength @xmath41 ) @xcite .",
    "alfvn waves can decay into ion sound waves through three wave interactions @xmath42 . the ion sound mode , like the normal sound wave , is longitudinal and is heavily damped unless the ion temperature is much higher than the electron temperature .",
    "the process is efficient in the low @xmath43 limit , an approximation relevant for the magnetar .",
    "thus , this process provides an effective way to damp the alfvn wave .",
    "we consider the weak turbulence approximation in which the wave energy and momentum are conserved in each interaction .",
    "the energy and momentum conservation here , also referred to as the three - wave resonance condition , is described by @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 represent the frequencies and wave vectors of the incoming ( @xmath32 ) , scattered ( @xmath33 ) waves and the ion sound ( @xmath49 ) wave , respectively .",
    "the condition on the wave vectors is shown in figure  [ fig : wdecay ] .",
    "the dispersion of the ion sound wave is @xmath50 with @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the electron temperature and we assume ions are protons . in the following we assume the incoming alfvn wave propagates forward with respect to the magnetic field , @xmath53 .",
    "the only permitted processes are those with @xmath54 , corresponding to an alfvn wave decays into a sound wave and an oppositely directed alfvn wave . from the resonance condition one has @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "the decay rate can be determined by the growth rate of the backward propagating wave generated from the process . in the following",
    "we derive the growth rate in the broadband approximation where the relevant waves have a broad range of frequencies and wave vectors .    .",
    "since @xmath57 one has @xmath58 and @xmath59.,width=283 ]      in the broadband approximation , a collection of waves in a particular mode can be described by the wave occupation number .",
    "let @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 be the occupation numbers of the incoming alfvn wave , scattered alfvn wave and sound wave .",
    "one can write down three kinetic equations that determine the rate of change of these three occupation numbers  @xcite . to determine the efficiency of the decay we consider the evolution of the scattered alfvn wave .",
    "since ion acoustic waves are heavily damped , one can neglect @xmath63 . for @xmath64 , the kinetic equation for the scattered wave ( @xmath33 ) due to the processes @xmath65 and @xmath66",
    "can be written approximately as @xmath67\\biggr|_{_{{\\bf k}''={\\bf k}-{\\bf k } ' } } , \\label{eq : gam1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 , @xmath68 is the probability for the transition @xmath42 , @xmath69 is the quadratic response tensor , @xmath70 is the ratio of the electric energy to the total energy in the sound wave , and the corresponding ratio for the incoming and scattered waves is taken to be @xmath71 .",
    "the three vectors @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath74 are the polarizations of the three waves concerned .",
    "the evolution of the scattered wave depends only the occupation number of the incoming wave .",
    "the growth of the backward propagating alfvn waves can be calculated from ( [ eq : gam1 ] ) .",
    "the three - wave probability can be derived assuming that electron motion in two high frequency waves ( @xmath30 , @xmath75 ) is treated in the cold plasma approximation .",
    "specifically , we assume the following conditions are satisfied : @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the electron thermal speed .",
    "the quadratic response tensor has the following approximation  @xcite @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the electronic contribution to the longitudinal component of the dielectric tensor , @xmath80 is the magnetic field direction , @xmath81 is the electron plasma frequency , @xmath82 is the permutation symbol ( 1 for even permutation , @xmath83 for odd permutation and 0 otherwise ) , and @xmath84 is the electron cyclotron frequency .",
    "the strong magnetic field approximation implies that only terms @xmath85 are important .",
    "since the component ( [ eq : a ] ) corresponds to the order @xmath86 terms in the quadratic response tensor , electrons and positrons do not cancel in three - wave interactions . in deriving the three - wave probability",
    "the alfvn waves are assumed to be linearly polarized with @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "the wave vectors are written as @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in the strong magnetic field ,",
    "one has @xmath91 with @xmath92 the ion plasma frequency . using ( [ eq : a ] ) , one obtains @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the classical electron radius .",
    "here we assume that the relevant waves are linearly polarized .",
    "for the three - wave probability to be nonzero , the two linear polarizations must be noncoplanar ( @xmath95 ) . denoting the left - hand side of ( [ eq : gam1 ] ) by @xmath96 one",
    "obtains @xmath97\\biggl|_{k_\\parallel =- k'_\\parallel } , \\label{eq : gam2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath98 is assumed to be axially symmetric .",
    "the growth rate is sensitive to the spectrum of the incoming alfvn waves , a result similar to that derived by @xcite in the mhd approximation in the special case where the alfvn waves are circularly polarized propagating parallel or antiparallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the propagation of alfvn waves emitted from the surface due to coupling of the shear waves is oblique @xmath99 ( sec .",
    "2 ) , implying @xmath100 is anisotropic in the @xmath101 space . as an example",
    ", we consider @xmath102 where the parameter @xmath103 characterizes the anisotropy , which can be taken as @xmath104 for the emission mechanism discussed in sec .",
    "this corresponds to an energy spectrum @xmath105 of the incoming wave .",
    "it can be shown that the positive growth ( corresponding to decay of the incoming waves ) requires a spectrum with a positive slope .",
    "this condition can be understood as follows .",
    "for a transition @xmath42 , there is an inverse process @xmath106 that removes the @xmath33 waves . for @xmath42 to be dominant over @xmath106 , an inversion ( i.e. a positive slope ) in the occupation number @xmath100 is required . assuming that the spectrum is peaked at @xmath107 with the positive slope characterized by a power index @xmath108 , the growth rate is derived as @xmath109 although the parameter @xmath110 is not present explicitly in the growth rate , the condition @xmath64 is needed so that the three - wave resonance condition can be satisfied @xcite .",
    "in the following we specifically consider sgrs , which are characterized by sporadic outbursts as well as occasional giant bursts . the burst emission from sgrs",
    "is generally considered to be magnetospheric origin , while the persistent , pulsed emission may be attributed to surface emission .",
    "normal outbursts typically last weeks or months and consist of many ordinary , repetitive short bursts that last about 0.1 s , which sets a lower limit to the damping time for the incoming alfvn wave .",
    "this damping time can be determined from the growth time of the backward propagating wave ( cf .",
    "[ eq : gam3 ] ) .    to estimate the growth rate",
    "one needs to assume a specific form of the incoming wave spectrum which should be determined by the shear waves in the crust .",
    "so far , no detailed model is available for the calculation of the latter .",
    "however , one may make an analogy with the energy spectra of shear waves in earthquakes by assuming a spectrum peaked at a characteristic frequency given by @xmath111 @xcite .",
    "the decay process discussed in sec 3 occurs for @xmath112 .",
    "we assume that emission of alfvn waves from the surface is accompanied by injection of plasmas of protons plus electrons ( or / and positrons ) into the magnetosphere .",
    "the plasma density is not well constrained but its minimum density should be about the gj density @xmath113 , where we ignore the cosine angle between the magnetic field and the rotation axis .",
    "assuming @xmath114 , @xmath115 . about the gj density , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 , the growth time",
    "is estimated to be @xmath118 for @xmath119 .",
    "this time is much shorter than the cascade time through @xmath120 @xcite , implying that the decay occurs at a much faster rate than pure alfvnic cascades .",
    "the backward propagating wave generated from the process may be reflected from the surface and propagates forward undergoing further decay . as a result ,",
    "the waves are trapped close to the surface ( at a distance @xmath121 from the surface ) without propagating to the opposite foot points ( as shown in figure [ fig : trap ] ) .",
    "the trapped waves continue to decay into ion sound waves which are absorbed by thermal electrons . as a result , the plasma can be rapidly heated leading to x - ray emission .",
    "since the fraction of the wave energy dissipated in each interaction is @xmath122 , the time for the trapped waves to be absorbed is @xmath123 , which is comparable to the typical time scale of individual bursts .",
    "an attractive aspect of the mechanism discussed here is that the x - ray emission from the decay of alfvn waves is intrinsically variable on the time @xmath124",
    ". such time scale may be relevant for variabilities observed in giant flares @xcite .",
    "however , to assess its relevance a quantitative model for the emission region is needed , which is beyond the scope of this paper and will be discussed elsewhere .",
    "transport of magnetic fields in the neutron star causes magnetic dissipation both in the core and outside the star .",
    "the former leads to heating which may be radiated through neutrino emission or partially conducts to the surface producing thermal x - ray emission . in the latter case ,",
    "the magnetic energy is efficiently transported to the magnetar s magnetosphere in alfvn waves .",
    "these waves decay through three - wave interactions .",
    "it is suggested here that because of the low @xmath64 , the process involving a alfvn wave decaying into ion sound waves that are then damped is the most efficient way to dissipate the magnetic energy . in each interaction , the alfvn wave cascades toward the small wavenumber regime .",
    "since the process is intrinsically dissipative converting the energy in the wave to kinetic energy in the plasma , such ` inverse cascade ' can be understood in analogy with the langmuir condensation due to nonlinear landau damping which tends to pump the lanmguir wave from larger to smaller wavenumber @xcite .",
    "the growth rate for the scattered alfvn wave , which quantifies the efficiency of the process , is calculated in the random phase approximation that is applicable provided that the waves generated have a broad range of frequencies and wave numbers .",
    "this approximation is relevant since the crust dislocations or fractures may produce many shear waves that are not related in phase ( i.e. incoherent waves ) .",
    "it is shown here that the absorption time can be comparable to or shorter than the typical duration of individual outbursts , suggesting that such process can be important for transient x - ray emission .",
    "note that the decay process considered here was widely discussed in the mhd approximation in the context of modulational instability or parametric decay with the application to the solar wind or solar flares @xcite .",
    "there were also recent discussions of this process using numerical simulation @xcite .",
    "these discussions mostly concentrated on circularly polarized alfvn waves and assumed that the incoming wave is monochromatic with the growth rate estimated to be @xmath125 in the limit @xmath126 @xcite .",
    "it is debatable whether such result is relevant for the solar wind and solar flares because in both cases , the incoming waves should be broad band and it may not be appropriate to treat the incoming waves as a single coherent wave .",
    "furthermore , in both cases the parameter @xmath127 is moderate . at a relatively large @xmath110 the waves concerned ( the relevant side - band waves ) are away from the corresponding natural modes and as a result",
    ", the growth rate is considerably reduced .",
    "it is shown here that the decay process is favored in magnetars and can be an effective mechanism for magnetic dissipation required for the interpretation for the observed transient x - ray emission .",
