    "we refer to @xmath11 as @xmath12 s _ preference list_. the agents that are adjacent to @xmath12 in @xmath13 are said to be _ acceptable _ to  @xmath12 .",

    "a matching is called _ stable _ if no edge blocks it",
    ". denote by sr the special case of sri in which @xmath23 .",
    "gale and shapley  @xcite observed that an instance of sr need not admit a stable matching .",
    "irving  @xcite gave a linear - time algorithm to find a stable matching or report that none exists , given an instance of sr .",
    "the straightforward modification of this algorithm to the sri case is described in  @xcite .",
    "we call an sri instance _ solvable _ if it admits a stable matching .    in practice agents",
    "may find it difficult to rank a large number of alternatives in strict order of preference .",
    "one natural assumption , therefore , is that preference lists are short , which corresponds to the graph being of bounded degree . given an integer @xmath24 , we define @xmath0-sri to be the restriction of sri in which @xmath13 is of bounded degree  @xmath0 .",
    "this special case of sri problem has potential applications in organising tournaments . as already pointed out in a paper of kujansuu et al .",
    "@xcite , sri can model a pairing process similar to the swiss system , which is used in large - scale chess competitions .",
    "the assumption on short lists is reasonable , because according to the swiss system , players can be matched only to other players with approximately the same score .",
    "a second variant of sri , which can be motivated in a similar fashion , arises if we allow ties in the preference lists , i.e. , @xmath11 is now a strict weak ordering is a strict partial order in which incomparability is transitive . ]",
    "( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we refer to this problem as the _ stable roommates problem with ties and incomplete lists _ ( srti )  @xcite . as in the sri case , define @xmath0-srti to be the restriction of srti in which @xmath13 is of bounded degree  @xmath0 .",
    "denote by srt the special case of srti in which @xmath23 . in the context of the motivating application of chess tournament construction as mentioned in the previous paragraph , @xmath0-srti is naturally obtained if a chess player has several potential partners of the same score and match history in the tournament .    in the srti context , ties correspond to indifference in the preference lists . in particular ,",
    "if @xmath25 and @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 then @xmath12 is said to be _ indifferent between _ @xmath15 and  @xmath16 .",
    "thus preference in the sri context corresponds to strict preference in the case of srti .",
    "relative to the strict weak orders in @xmath8 , we can define stability in srti instances in exactly the same way as for sri .",
    "this means , for example , that if @xmath19 for some matching @xmath18 , and @xmath12 is indifferent between @xmath15 and some agent @xmath16 , then @xmath29 can not block  @xmath18 .",
    "the term _ solvable _ can be defined in the srti context in an analogous fashion to sri . using a highly technical reduction from a restriction of 3-sat",
    ", ronn  @xcite proved that the problem of deciding whether a given srt instance is solvable is @xmath1-complete .",
    "a simpler reduction was given by irving and manlove  @xcite .",
    "for solvable instances of sri there can be many stable matchings .",
    "often it is beneficial to work with a stable matching that is fair to all agents in a precise sense  @xcite .",
    "one such fairness concept can be defined as follows .",
    "given two agents @xmath12 , @xmath15 in an instance @xmath30 of sri , where @xmath25 , let @xmath31 denote the rank of @xmath15 in @xmath12 s preference list ( that is , 1 plus the number of agents that @xmath12 prefers to @xmath15 ) .",

    "finding an egalitarian stable matching in sr was shown to be @xmath1-hard by feder  @xcite .",
    "feder  @xcite also gave a 2-approximation algorithm for this problem in the sri setting .",
    "he also showed that an egalitarian stable matching in sr can be approximated within a factor of @xmath36 of the optimum if and only if minimum vertex cover can be approximated within the same factor  @xmath36 .",
    "is was proved later that , assuming the unique games conjecture , minimum vertex cover can not be approximated within @xmath37 for any @xmath38  @xcite .    given an unsolvable instance @xmath33 of sri or srti , a natural approximation to a stable matching is a _ most - stable _ matching  @xcite .",
    "relative to a matching @xmath18 in @xmath33 , define @xmath39 to be the set of blocking edges of @xmath18 and let @xmath40 denote the minimum value of @xmath41 , taken over all matchings @xmath42 in  @xmath33 .",
    "then @xmath18 is a _ most - stable _ matching in @xmath33 if @xmath43 .",
    "the problem of finding a most - stable matching was shown to be @xmath1-hard and not approximable within @xmath44 , for any @xmath45 , unless @xmath46 , where @xmath47 if @xmath33 is an instance of sr and @xmath48 if @xmath33 is an instance of srt @xcite .    to the best of our knowledge",
    ", there has not been any previous work published on either the problem of finding an egalitarian stable matching in a solvable instance of sri with bounded - length preference lists or the solvability of srti with bounded - length preference lists .",
    "this paper provides contributions in both of these directions , focusing on instances of @xmath0-sri and @xmath0-srti for @xmath49 , with the aim of drawing the line between polynomial - time solvability and @xmath1-hardness for the associated problems in terms of  @xmath0 .      in section  [",
    "se : egal ] we study the problem of finding an egalitarian stable matching in an instance of @xmath0-sri .",
    "we show that this problem is @xmath1-hard if @xmath2 , whilst there is a straightforward algorithm for the case that @xmath6 .",
    "we then consider the approximability of this problem for the case that @xmath50 .",
    "we give an approximation algorithm with a performance guarantee of @xmath51 for the case that @xmath2 , @xmath52 if @xmath53 and @xmath54 if @xmath55 .",
    "these performance guarantees improve on feder s 2-approximation algorithm for the general sri case  @xcite . in section  [ se : srt ] we turn to @xmath0-srti and prove that the problem of deciding whether an instance of @xmath56-srti is solvable is @xmath1-complete .",
    "we then show that the problem of finding a most - stable matching in an instance of @xmath0-srti is solvable in polynomial time if @xmath6 , whilst for @xmath2 we show that this problem is @xmath1-hard and not approximable within @xmath57 , for any @xmath45 , unless @xmath46 .",
    "due to various complications , as explained in section  [ se : no_egal_srti ] , we do not attempt to define and study egalitarian stable matchings in instances of srti . a structured overview of previous results and our results ( marked by * ) for @xmath0-sri and @xmath0-srti is contained in table  [ ta : results ] .",
    "if a variable @xmath58 @xmath59 is assigned to be @xmath60 , @xmath61 is added to @xmath18 , otherwise @xmath62 is added .",
    "similarly , since at least one literal in @xmath63 @xmath64 is true , let @xmath65 ( @xmath66 be the minimum integer such that the literal at position @xmath65 of @xmath63 is @xmath60 ; add @xmath67 to  @xmath18 .",
    "the intuition behind this choice is that if a literal is @xmath60 , then the vertex representing it in the variable gadget is matched to its best choice . on the other hand ,",
    "if some literals in a clause are @xmath60 , then the vertex representing the appearance of one of them in that clause is matched to its last - choice vertex .",
    "we claim that no edge blocks  @xmath18 .",
    "checking the edges in the clause and variable gadgets is easy .",
    "the five special matchings were designed in such a way that no edge within the gadgets blocks them .",
    "more explanation is needed regarding the interconnecting edges .",
    "suppose one of them , @xmath68 , @xmath69 blocks  @xmath18 . since @xmath18 is a perfect matching , @xmath70 needs to be matched to its last choice , a @xmath71-vertex .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 has to be matched to its worst partner .",
    "while the partner of @xmath70 indicates that the literal represented by @xmath72 ( @xmath58 or @xmath73 ) is @xmath60 in the clause , the partner of @xmath72 means that the literal is @xmath74 .",
    "first of all , if a vertex @xmath76 is the only first choice of another vertex , then @xmath76 certainly needs to be matched in  @xmath18 .",
    "this property is fulfilled for all vertices of all clause gadgets except for @xmath77 and @xmath78 for each @xmath63 ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "let us first study clause gadget  @xmath63 .",
    "if @xmath80 is matched to @xmath81 , then @xmath82 blocks  @xmath18 .",
    "thus , @xmath83 , and similarly , @xmath84 are part of @xmath18 for all clause gadgets .",
    "our proof for clause gadgets from this point involves considering matchings covering all twelve remaining vertices .",
    "we differentiate two possible cases , depending on the partner of  @xmath85 . in the first case , @xmath86",
    "therefore , @xmath87 too , because @xmath88 has to be matched . for similar reasons , @xmath89",
    "this gives us matching  @xmath90 . in the second case ,",
    "if @xmath85 is matched to @xmath88 , then @xmath91 .",
    "there are two possible matchings on the remaining six vertices : @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "these two matchings together with the lower part of the gadget form @xmath94 and  @xmath95 .",
    "since all @xmath96-vertices have a partner within their clause gadgets , no interconnecting edge can be a part of  @xmath18 . for the variable gadgets , it is straightforward to see that @xmath61 and @xmath62 are the only matchings covering all vertices of the 4-cycles .    the truth assignment to @xmath75 is then defined in the following way .",
    "each variable whose gadget has the edges of @xmath61 in @xmath18 is assigned to be @xmath60 , while all other variables with @xmath62 on their gadgets are @xmath74 .",
    "all that remains is to show that this is indeed a truth assignment .",
    "suppose that there is an unsatisfied clause @xmath63 in  @xmath75 .",
    "since all three of @xmath63 s literals are @xmath74 , every vertex @xmath97 ( @xmath14 ) such that @xmath98 is an interconnecting edge prefers @xmath99 to its partner in @xmath18 ( @xmath100 ) .",
    "hence a blocking edge can only be avoided if @xmath101 , @xmath102 and @xmath103 are all in  @xmath18 , which never occurs in any stable matching as shown above .",
    "our construction shows that the complexity result holds even if the preference lists are either strictly ordered or consist of a single tie of length two .",
    "moreover , theorem [ th:3-srti ] also immediately implies the following result .",
    "the core idea of the proof is to gather several copies of the 3-srti instance created in the proof of theorem  [ th:3-srti ] , together with a small unsolvable 3-srti instance . by doing so",
    ", we create a min bp 3-srti instance @xmath30 in which @xmath106 is large if the boolean formula @xmath75 ( originally given as an instance of ( 2,2)-e3-sat ) is not satisfiable , and @xmath107 otherwise .",
    "therefore , finding a good approximation for @xmath33 will imply a polynomial - time algorithm to decide the satisfiability of  @xmath75 .",
    "our proof is similar to that of an analogous inapproximabilty result for the problem of finding a most - stable matching in an instance of the hospitals / residents problem with couples  @xcite .",
    "the smallest unsolvable instance of 3-srti is a 3-cycle with cyclic strict preferences . aside from this , we add @xmath108 disjoint copies of 3-srti instance created in the proof of theorem [ th:3-srti ] ( from the same boolean formula  @xmath75 ) , for large enough  @xmath108 . in particular we let @xmath109 and @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the number of variables in  @xmath75 .",
    "we use @xmath112 to denote the number of clauses in  @xmath75 .",
    "let @xmath33 be the instance of 3-srti that has been constructed .",
    "due to the proof of theorem  [ th:3-srti ] above , if @xmath75 is satisfiable then @xmath113 , and if @xmath75 is not satisfiable then @xmath114 .",
    "hence a @xmath108-approximation algorithm for min bp 3-srti could be used to solve ( 2,2)-e3-sat in polynomial time .    in the remainder of the proof",
    "we show that @xmath115 , where @xmath105 is the number of agents in @xmath33 , which will imply the statement of the theorem . with inequalities  ( [ sreq:1])-([sreq:4 ] )",
    "we give an upper bound for  @xmath105 .",
    "this is used in inequalities  ( [ sreq:5])-([sreq:8 ] ) as we establish @xmath108 as an upper bound for @xmath57 .",
    "explanations for the steps are given as and when it is necessary after each set of inequalities .",
    "@xmath116    in equality  ( [ sreq:1 ] ) can be deduced by inspection of the 3-srti instance constructed in the proof of theorem [ th:3-srti ] . in step  ( [ sreq:2 ] )",
    "we substitute @xmath117 , which follows from the structure of  @xmath75 .",
    "we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath118 , which we use in inequality  ( [ sreq:3 ] ) .",
    "finally , in equality  ( [ sreq:4 ] ) we substitute @xmath110 .",
    "inequality  ( [ sreq:5 ] ) is obtained by raising @xmath105 to the power of each side of inequality  ( [ sreq : extra ] ) .",
    "inequality  ( [ sreq:6 ] ) follows from the bound for @xmath105 established in inequalities  ( [ sreq:1])-([sreq:4 ] ) . now in inequality  ( [ sreq:7 ] ) we can assume without loss of generality that @xmath122 and use that @xmath123 .",
    "in the last step , we use the definition of  @xmath108 .        for an instance @xmath33 of min bp 2-srti , clearly",
    "every component of the underlying graph @xmath13 is a path or cycle .",
    "we claim that @xmath106 equals the number of _ odd parties _ in  @xmath13 , where an _ odd party _ is a cycle @xmath125 of odd length , such that @xmath126 strictly prefers @xmath127 to @xmath128 ( addition and subtraction are taken modulo  @xmath108 ) .",
    "since an odd party never admits a stable matching , @xmath106 is bounded below by the number of odd parties  @xcite .",
    "this bound is tight : by taking an arbitrary maximum matching in an odd party component , a most - stable matching is already reached .",
    "now we show that a stable matching @xmath18 can be constructed in all other components .",
    "each component that is not an odd cycle is therefore a bipartite subgraph ( indeed either a path or an even cycle ) .",
    "such a subgraph therefore gives rise to the restriction of srti called the _",
    "stable marriage problem with ties and incomplete lists _ ( smti ) .",
    "an instance of smti always admits a stable solution and it can be found in linear time  @xcite .",
    "thus these components contribute no blocking edge .",
    "regarding odd - length cycles that are not odd parties , we will show that there is at least one vertex not strictly preferred by either of its adjacent vertices . leaving this vertex uncovered and adding a perfect matching in the rest of the cycle results in a stable matching .",
    "assume that every vertex along a cycle @xmath129 ( where @xmath108 is an odd number ) is strictly preferred by at least one of its neighbours .",
    "since each of the @xmath108 vertices is strictly preferred by at least one vertex , and a vertex @xmath130 can prefer at most one other vertex strictly , every vertex along @xmath129 has a strictly ordered preference list .",
    "now every vertex can point at its unique first - choice neighbour . to avoid an odd cycle",
    ", there must be a vertex pointed at by both of its neighbours .",
    "this implies that there is also a vertex @xmath130 pointed at by no neighbour , and @xmath130 is hence ranked second by both of its neighbours .        * when considering the approximability of egal @xmath0-sri , we restricted attention to the case of solvable instances , in the knowledge that solvability can be determined in linear time  @xcite .",
    "however in the case of srti , we can no longer assume this , since solvable 3-srti is @xmath1-complete as theorem  [ th:3-srti ] shows .",
    "* in instances of egal @xmath0-sri , not all agents are necessarily matched in all stable matchings , but due to theorem 4.5.2 of  @xcite , which states that the same agents are matched in all stable matchings , we can discard unmatched agents and consider only the remaining agents when reasoning about approximation algorithms . there is no analogue of theorem 4.5.2 in the case of @xmath0-srti ( indeed , stable matchings can be of different sizes in a given instance of srti  @xcite ) .",
    "this means that any approximation algorithm for the problem of finding an egalitarian stable matching in an instance of srti would need to consider the cost of an unmatched agent in a given stable matching , and the choice of value for such a case is not universally agreed upon in the literature . * similarly in the case of srti , the choice of value for the rank of an agent @xmath15 in a given agent @xmath12 s preference list is again not universally agreed upon  for example if @xmath12 has a tie of length 2 at the head of her preference list , followed strictly by @xmath15 , then @xmath31 could reasonably be defined to be either 2 or 3 depending on the definition adopted .",
    "theorems  [ th : egal3 ] , [ th : egal4 ] and [ th : egal5 ] improve on the best known approximation factor for egal @xmath0-sri for small  @xmath0 .",
    "it remains open to come up with an even better approximation or to establish an inapproximability bound matching our algorithm s guarantee .",
    "a more general direction is to investigate whether the problem of finding a minimum weight stable matching can be approximated within a factor less than 2 for instances of @xmath0-sri for small  @xmath0 .",
