    "+ however the electric charge @xmath1 is not a generator of the isospin symmetry group , since it contains an isoscalar part proportional to the hypercharge @xmath2 , the sum of the strangeness @xmath3 and of the baryon number @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 to put weak and electromagnetic interactions on the same footing , the symmetry group had to be enlarged , to include @xmath6 among the generators , to a group of rank @xmath7 containing the @xmath8 group of isospin as a subgroup . among the two possible candidates",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 the latter was found to be the correct choice , with hadrons assigned to the representations @xmath11,@xmath12,@xmath13,@xmath14 , the so called eightfold way@xcite . +",
    "all the representations of @xmath10 are sum of products of the fundamental representations @xmath15 and @xmath16 , so that an obvious question was about the existence of particles in these representations , the quarks and the antiquarks , as fundamental constituents of hadronic matter .",
    "their charges as predicted by eq(1 ) are fractional @xmath17 , @xmath18 , a clear experimental signature . + an intense search for quarks was immediately started , but after 40 years no quark has ever been found , and only upper limits have been established for their production cross sections and abundance . +",
    "it was also realized that there was a problem with pauli principle .",
    "if the @xmath19 is made of three quarks , the state with charge @xmath7 and spin component @xmath20 is symmetric under exchange of the quarks since for any reasonable potential the three @xmath21 quarks are in @xmath3 state .",
    "a possible way out was to assign an extra quantum number to the quarks@xcite , which was named color , so that each quark could exist in three different color states .",
    "+ after the quantization of the gauge theories it was suggested that the color symmetry could be an @xmath10 gauge symmetry with quarks in the fundamental representation , and eight gauge bosons , the gluons mediating their interaction .",
    "the theory was named quantum chromodynamics ( qcd)@xcite . experiments provide evidence for the existence of quarks and gluons at short distances , but quarks never appear at large distances as free particles . +",
    "this phenomenon is known as confinement of color .",
    "the ratio @xmath22 of the abundances of quarks and antiquarks to the abundance of nucleons has been investigated typically by millikan - like experiments .",
    "no particle with fractional charge has ever been found , with an upper limit @xcite @xmath23 the expectation for @xmath24 in the absence of confinement can be evaluated in the standard cosmological model@xcite as follows .",
    "+ at @xmath25seconds after big - bang when the temperature was @xmath26 and the effective quark mass @xmath27 of the same order of magnitude , quarks would burn to produce hadrons by the esothermic reactions + @xmath28 + @xmath29 + putting @xmath30 , the burning rate is given by @xmath31 .",
    "the expansion rate in the model is equal to @xmath32 with @xmath33 newton gravitational constant ant @xmath34 the temperature .",
    "the decoupling of relic quarks will occur when due to the burning processes the quark density will decrease to a value such that the burning rate is smaller than the expansion rate , or when @xmath35 since the abundance of photons is @xmath36 , dividing both sides of eq(3 ) by @xmath37 gives @xmath38 by use of the experimental values @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and assuming @xmath41 , @xmath42 we get @xmath43 quarks have been also searched as products of particle reactions @xcite , again with no result .",

    "the only natural possibility is that the ratios are zero , i.e. that confinement is an absolute property , due to some symmetry of the system .",
    "+ this is similar to what happens in superconductivity , where the explanation for the upper limits on the resistivity is that it is exactly zero , due to the higgs breaking of the conservation of electric charge , or in electrodynamics where the natural explanation for the upper limit to the photon mass is that it is exactly zero , the symmetry being gauge invariance .",
    "+ no experimental evidence exists for the confinement of the gluons .",
    "+ we shall , anyhow , define confinement as absence of colored particles in asymptotic states .",

    "+ as a working hypothesis we shall assume that some symmetry of the ground state is responsible for confinement .",
    "a limiting temperature exists in hadron physics , known as hagedorn temperature @xcite @xmath49 , due to the property of strong interactions to convert excess of energy into creation of particles .",
    "it was first conjectured in 1975@xcite that its existence could be the indication of a deconfining phase transition from hadron to a plasma of quarks and gluons . + this transition has not yet been detected experimentally , but extensive experimental programs and dedicated machines are being devoted to it at cern sps , at brookhaven ( rhic),and at cern lhc . the transition has been observed in lattice qcd . + both in experiments and in lattice simulations the main problem is to define and to detect the transition , i.e. to give an operational definition of confined and deconfined . in a way",

    "t plays the role of the coupling constant , low temperature corresponds to order , high temperature to disorder .",
    "+ the key word to understand what happens is duality .",
    "duality is a deep concept in statistical mechanics which has been exported into field theory and string theory .",
    "+ it was first introduced in @xcite and then developed in @xcite in the frame of the 2d ising model which , being solvable , is a prototype system for it .",

    "+ 2 ) a dual description in which the topological excitations become local and the original fields non local excitations .",

    "we have discussed the experimental evidence for confinement and how it naturally implies that there exists a dual symmetry in qcd whose breaking is responsible for confinement .",
    "we have presented the two most accredited candidates for dual topological excitations , vortices and monopoles .",
    "+ we have then shown how the working hypothesis that monopoles confine via dual superconductivity of the vacuum can be tested by numerical simulations on the lattice , through an order parameter which is the @xmath313 of operators carrying magnetic charge .",
    "the numerical tests strongly support the validity of this idea , which can be put in a consistent form and made independent on the choice of the abelian projection .",
    "this holds both for quenched qcd and in the presence of dynamical quarks . +",
    "a prerequisite is that deconfinement is a true order - disorder phase transition , and not a crossover , which would allow a continuous path from confined to deconfined phase .",
