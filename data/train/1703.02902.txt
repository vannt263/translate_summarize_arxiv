    "massive stars have a profound impact on the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) , their winds and supernovae carving out the surrounding volume , creating shells , cavities , and outflows of mass from the galaxy disc .",
    "this effect is amplified by the presence of these stars in ob associations . in those cases a significant quantity of gas can be blown out into the galactic halo , and in stronger outflows can escape into the intergalactic medium .",
    "the feedback from massive stars is critical for the self - regulation of star formation , which can be quenched when the parental molecular cloud is disrupted , or even enhanced if the expanding gas destabilizes nearby molecular clouds , which collapse to produce new stars @xcite .",
    "this feedback is put suggested as the cause of the overall low star formation efficiency observed in spiral galaxies , which extends the duration of star formation and prevents the gas from being depleted too quickly @xcite .",
    "a correct modelling of these effects is , according to this scenario , a key to produce realistic simulations of galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "the injection of energy by massive stars into their surrounding medium generally produces expanding bubbles which occur over a wide range of scales , from sizes of a few pc around single stars to kpc scale superbubbles blown by starbursts . measuring the properties of these bubbles ,",
    "notably their kinetic energies of expansion , is essential for the evaluation of stellar feedback , in galaxy discs and in their circumnuclear zones .",
    "these measurements can also be useful for indirect estimation of the properties of the originating star or star cluster , constraining parameters such as the minimum number of ob stars in a cluster which could power the bubble .",
    "it is particularly interesting to estimate the age of the bubble , because this allows us to estimate the age of the star cluster itself , given that feedback commonly shuts off further star formation inside an hii region after the initial burst and the winds by the massive stars begin to act immediately on the gas",
    ". however the accuracy of these estimates is limited by the reliability of the model used to predict the evolution of the expanding bubble , which tend to be simplified , unless one performs detailed studies of individual cases , and preferably with well - structured simulations . in spite of the limitations this is a useful method for estimating cluster ages when lacking the resolution needed to resolve the individual stars .    the strongly interacting pair of galaxies ngc 4038/4039 ( also arp 244 , and commonly known as the antennae ) is in the intermediate stages of a merger .",
    "the interaction has triggered a powerful starburst , notably in the overlap region where the interaction is strongest .",
    "as this object is one of the nearest examples of this type of starbursts it attracts considerable attention , and is one of the most studied galaxy pairs in the sky .",
    "this environment is an ideal laboratory for the probing of feedback by massive stars .",
    "the young stellar clusters have been studied extensively both as a population , measuring their luminosity and mass functions @xcite , and individually in detail @xcite .",
    "there are also studies of the molecular gas and dust , and their relation to the star clusters @xcite . in a recent publication @xcite",
    "the authors of the present paper have compared the mass functions and the density distributions of the molecular and ionized gas clouds , showing that for both gas phases there are two populations , divided at a critical mass which is comparable for the hii region population and that of the molecular clouds .",
    "bubbles and superbubbles in general have long been subjects of study , as they have been well detected in the galaxy and in nearby galaxies .",
    "most of these detections have been made in neutral hydrogen , using the kinematics of the 21 cm line , and include the local bubble around the solar neighbourhood @xcite as well as bubbles in m31 @xcite , m33 @xcite .",
    "detections have also been made using the ionized gas with h@xmath0 in the magellanic clouds @xcite , and more recently @xcite for the lmc superbubbles .",
    "examples of expansion in galactic outbursts such as in m82 @xcite , ngc 3079 @xcite and the irregular galaxy ic 1613 @xcite have been reported .",
    "these are only a few selected examples of a progressively extending literature on the subject . but given the importance of stellar feedback on galaxy evolution in general amplifying the observation and above all the quantification of superbubbles to as large a sample of galaxies as possible is of strong interest to the field .",
    "this interest has grown in recent years with several studies pointing to the feedback from massive stars as an important factor in a wide variety of astrophysical problems .",
    "these include the possible dissipation of nuclear dark matter cusps @xcite the dissemination of metals both within galaxies @xcite and into the intergalactic medium @xcite and the enhancement of the infall rate of low metallicity intergalactic gas to galaxy discs by interaction with supernova ejecta in the galactic halo @xcite .",
    "we observed the antennae pair of galaxies using the galaxy h@xmath0 fabry - perot system ( gh@xmath0fas,@xcite ) , obtaining a calibrated data cube which mapped kinematically the h@xmath0 emission line over the extent of both galaxies , with only the extended hi tails falling outside the field . in practice",
    "we mapped the full extent of the h@xmath0 emission from the object .",
    "the observations were first presented in @xcite .",
    "gh@xmath0fas is an integral field spectrometer mounted at the nasmyth focus of the 4.2 m william herschel telescope ( wht ) at the observatorio del roque de los muchachos ( orm ) la palma .",
    "it produces a 3.4 arcmin x 3.4 arcmin data cube with seeing - limited angular resolution ( spaxel size @xmath2 arcsec ) and a spectrum over each spaxel with 48 channels covering a spectral range which depends to second order on the wavelength range of the observed emission , but is close to 400 km / s yielding a sampling velocity resolution of @xmath3 km / s at h@xmath0 .",
    "the data reduction procedures for gh@xmath0fas have been well described in the literature ( see e.g. @xcite ) , so here were give a very brief summary . in order to optimize the field size and the optical throughput gh@xmath0fas",
    "does not use a field derotator so the required rotation correction is applied a posteriori with software , which is described , along with the procedures for velocity calibration , phase correction , sky background removal and adaptive binning , all of which are described in @xcite or @xcite .",
    "the end product of this initial reduction is a data cube which is used here as described below .",
    "we used a flux - calibrated and continuum - subtracted image of the object in h@xmath0 for the calibration procedure of the shells detected with the data cube , as we have learned from experience that this is more reliable than calibrating the cube directly .",
    "the image was taken with the direct imaging camera acam , also on the wht .",
    "for the spectroscopic part of the study we used the intermediate dispersion spectrograph ( ids ) at the cassegrain focus of the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) also at the orm .",
    "this yields long - slit spectra , 3.3 arcmin unvignetted , and we used a slit - width of 1 arcsec , and a grating which produced a plate scale of 0.44 a / pixel using the red+2 detector .",
    "the aim of the long - slit spectroscopy was to measure the relative intensities of the ha , [ nii ] doublet , and [ sii ] doublet lines , to compute line ratios and then perform tests on the ionizing radiation of the detected expanding shells .",
    "the spectra were reduced using iraf and was particularly simple ; the lines are close enough together and observed with the same system so that reddening correction was not needed , nor was calibration necessary as we were interested only in the line ratios .",
    "to detect the superbubbles we used our purpose - developed program bubbly .",
    "this is described in detail in @xcite so here we give only an outline of how it works .",
    "hii regions are optically thin in h@xmath0 , the only extinction is provided by any dust present .",
    "this enables us to observe simultaneously any material expanding towards the observer and any material expanding away from the observer , from the front and the back of an expanding shell respectively . as we observe an ionized zone in h@xmath0 the emission line profile at any point where there is a bubble along the line of sight is triple - peaked with the brightest , central peak emanating from the bulk of the hii region , and two symmetrically placed fainter peaks emitted by the shell .",
    "our program , bubbly , first detects the presence of multiple components in the line profiles across the full field of the data cube , and then searches for the tell - tale signature of symmetrically blue- and red - shifted ( within uncertainty limits ) weaker emissions in the wings of a main emission peak . in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_ex ] we show an example of a spectrum showing this type of expansion signature ( the other weak features may be real emission but not due to a bubble as they are not symmetrically placed with respect to the main peak ) .",
    "we represent the information obtained with bubbly in the form of an `` expansion map '' produced by assigning to each spatial point the mean velocity separation of the secondary peaks detected , if any .",
    "we can then use this expansion map to locate bubbles , searching for spatially coherent structures within the detected expansion .",
    "this allows us to derive the radial size of the bubble , one its most relevant physical parameters , as well as to discard apparent , but false detections which can arise from noise or from independent clouds coincidentally aligned along particular lines of sight .    in figure [ exp_map ]",
    "we show the expansion map of the antennae , next to an h@xmath0 surface brightness image , for comparison .",
    "the map shows detected expansion at some level of significance across practically the full extent of the area with detected h@xmath0 emission , but it is clear that around most of the brightest hii regions we find more coherent structures , which show higher detected velocities of expansion .",
    "these are what we claim are superbubble detections , and this claim is supported by the coincidence of their centres with those of the hii regions themselves , as well as by the radial symmetry they show . in the figure",
    "we have marked the presence of each superbubble with black circles both on the expansion map and on the h@xmath0 map ; these circles show their estimated radial sizes .",
    "some of these bubbles are very well defined : bubbles with the identifiers 1 , 10 , 11 and 14 are particularly prominent , showing better coverage and spatial coherence .",
    "it is also interesting to pay particular attention to the overlap zone , the area where the interaction has the most effect on the ism , and where there are some of the brightest hii regions , which have made this the most explored part of the object as found in the literature . in this area",
    "we find the clearest superbubble , identified as bubble 1 , but we also see in the area below bubble 2 a zone with quite a lot of high velocity expansion which does not , however , show circular morphology coincident with the underlying hii regions .",
    "this probably indicates that while there are indeed massive outflows from these young regions they do not maintain the pseudo - spherical shape of a bubble , ( due probably to the inhomogeneity of the surrounding ism ) , or that the shape is too complicated for us to determine with our data and method . for an irregularly shaped expanding shell",
    "the difference in velocity between the approaching and receding surfaces would in any case prevent our method from detecting it .",
    "this is a possible factor underlying the incoherent detections shown .",
    "we can also see that , apart from the detections on and around the bright hii regions there is extended , less geometrically coherent detection across the full face of the interacting galaxies .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that in other galaxies analysed in the same way we have found much less , or none of this extended expansion detection , above all in those galaxies in a more quiescent state .",
    "this leads us to believe that the dominant cause of these detections is not noise , but unresolved expansion , and more complex kinematic structure .",
    "these features also have low expansion velocities , which fits the scenario of smaller , less energetic drivers of the motion .",
    "from the expansion map we have a direct measurement of the expansion velocity and size of a superbubble .",
    "the flux is calculated using the relative intensities of the secondary peaks and a calibrated h@xmath0 image of the object .",
    "these are the primary quantities used to calculate the other physical parameters .",
    "a detailed description of the calculations can be found in @xcite , but essentially we use the relation :    @xmath4    @xmath5 stands for the shell radius , @xmath6 is its thickness and @xmath7 is the electron density .",
    "@xmath8 is the effective recombination coefficient for hydrogen and @xmath9 is the energy of an h@xmath0 photon .",
    "we have no direct way of measuring the shell width @xmath6 so we need to use an approximation . in section 5",
    "we perform hydrodynamical simulations of one of the detected bubbles , from which we derive a canonical value of 15% of the radius , which is also consistent with observations of local superbubbles @xcite .    with these quantities",
    "we can estimate the electronic density in the shell , and together with the radius , the shell thickness , and the velocity we can derive the total mass and the current kinetic energy for the ionized gas . while the uncertainty in the shell thickness certainly affects our results the systematic uncertainty depends on @xmath10 implying that an error by a factor as high as 3 in shell width implies only a change of @xmath11 in density , mass and energy .",
    "the density decreases with increasing shell width , whereas mass and density decrease .",
    "the values of the derived physical parameters for all the identified superbubbles are given in table [ prop_tab ] .",
    "an additional initial approximation we have used is that the bubbles are spherical .",
    "this would be good for homogeneous environments , but as our superbubbles are comparable to the scale height of the surrounding ism , its density gradient is relevant .",
    "many superbubbles are approaching or in the breakout phase of their evolution , so their shapes will be elongated perpendicular to the disc , i.e. in the direction of falling density , and their expansion velocity will not be isotropic . in section 5",
    "we use hydrodynamic simulations to reproduce one of the superbubbles , which gives us a useful approach to discuss these effects and their implications for the validity of our numerical parameters .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ , < , < \" , ]     * notes . *",
    "the first column lists the observational properties for bubble 1 , the other two correspond to two time steps in the simulation .",
    "the radius for the simulation results is taken as half the highest separation of density maxima in xy planes .",
    "the expansion velocity refers to the velocity in the z direction at the centre of the projected bubble .",
    "@xmath7 ( z ) is the maximum density along the z axis , we consider this measurement equivalent to the measurement done on the expansion map given the area of the bubble from which we extract the properties .",
    "@xmath7 ( xy ) is the maximum density in the xy axes , corresponding to expansion into the disc , we do not have a measurement of this value from the observational data .",
    "it is important to note that the kinetic energy and mass can not be compared directly as the observational quantity is overestimated for the kinetic energy and the mass is underestimated ( see text ) .",
    "[ sim_tab ]    we show also the measured parameters for ease of comparison .",
    "the density we observe coincides reasonably well with the density in the centre of the projected shell , but is quite different from the density in xy , the plane of the disc .",
    "this could be expected , as the emission we receive comes from the approaching part of the shell .",
    "however the discrepancy is carried into the computed mass of the model shell , where there is a considerable difference between this mass and the mass we measure .",
    "this is clearly important for the determination of the kinetic energy , as a mass discrepancy translates directly into the same discrepancy factor in the kinetic energy .",
    "as it happens , there is a compensating effect because the denser parts of the shell are also significantly slower , and the kinetic energy depends on the square of the velocity .",
    "we made the appropriate calculations on the simulation to ascertain the difference made because we observe only the approaching part of the shell .",
    "the result was that our observational technique underestimates the mass in the simulation by a factor 2 , while the kinetic energy is overestimated by a factor 3 . given that we have used the observed measurement of the kinetic energy as an input to represent the total kinetic energy fed into the bubble , while according to the simulation around half the kinetic energy has been lost by radiation , the current simulation is a really reasonable fit to the data , and accomplishes the basic goal of analyzing the plausibility of the measured parameters for such a superbubble , given the limited data set for any bubble determined at the distance of the antennae .",
    "the relations between the input physical parameters and those found by performing a mock observation of the simulation results could be used to perfect the simulation iteratively until we obtain an exact reproduction of the observed data .",
    "while tempting , we admit that this would not enhance the scientific value of the work , as it would in practice be `` overfitting '' the data . the model is schematic , and among the simplifications we note that we have not taken the supernova kinetic impact directly into account but have imitated this , using winds .",
    "we have also assumed a homogeneous ionized ism , and have not included the presence of molecular clouds or other inhomogeneities .",
    "if these could be well characterized by observation we would be able to use the observed kinematic parameters to derive accurate values for the energy injected , and thus constrain the properties of the cluster , but with the available information all we have tried to do is to present some useful semi - quantitative comparisons which put this work in a plausible context .",
    "there are two main mechanisms for injecting kinetic energy from stars in a massive stellar cluster into the expanding shell of a superbubble , stellar winds , and supernova explosions .",
    "supernova shocks are far more violent than the continuous input due to fast winds , and this is reflected in the ionization state of a shell produced by each of the mechanisms .",
    "collisional excitation is much more important in supernova remnants , while wind - blown bubbles are photoionized . by spectroscopic examination of the state of ionization of the shell we can try to determine which mechanism currently dominates its excitation , and therefore whether winds or supernovae are the principal contributors to the expansion at the stage when we observe it . for this",
    "we use the diagnostic plots from @xcite in which the line ratios [ sii]/h@xmath0 and [ nii]/ h@xmath0 are used .",
    "the observations were made using long slit spectroscopy with the isis spectrograph on the wht .",
    "the slit , with a 1 arcsec width , was placed to cover the overlap zone , including bubbles 1 and 3 .",
    "a modified version of bubbly was run on each of the lines : [ sii]@xmath12 , [ sii]@xmath13 , [ nii]@xmath14 , and h@xmath0 . the total flux for the [ nii ] doublet was calculated using the relation [ nii]@xmath14=3*[nii]@xmath15 which is virtually independent of the physical parameters of the gas .",
    "[ fig_ratios ] we show the results for the two bubbles and the incoherent region , in which we compare the line intensity ratios for the shells with those for the underlying hii regions .",
    "the circles correspond to the hii region flux while the triangles correspond to the shell .",
    "the shell ratios were calculated using the fluxes in the secondary peaks , while the fluxes for the regions were obtained from the central primary peak .",
    "we can see from the figure that in all the cases both the shell of the bubble , and the hii region show ratios well within the zone of the diagram which characterizes an hii region , showing that photoionization is currently dominant compared with shock - induced ionization .",
    "the points for the shells are , however , clearly somewhat nearer to the snr zone , which implies a somewhat greater role for shocks in the shells than in the bodies of the hii regions .",
    "this result is what one would expect , given the masses and the evolutionary stages of all our observed bubbles .",
    "a supernova remnant has masses of order a few solar masses , while our bubbles have accumulated many thousands of solar masses , as well as having had time to relax from initial supernova shocks . at this stage ,",
    "the addition of an additional supernova remnant expanding into the shell would not have a strong effect on its ionization state .",
    "* we applied bubbly , a program sensitive to the presence of expanding shells to a fabry - prot observation of the antennae pair of galaxies mapping the h@xmath0 emission line .",
    "the program detects and fits multiple components to the h@xmath0 line profile , for which the data obtained with gh@xmath0fas is ideal given its high kinematic ( 8 km s@xmath16 ) and spatial ( seeing - limited ) resolution . * using a map of the detected expansion we report the presence of 17 superbubbles associated with most of the brightest hii regions in the object .",
    "we estimate the sizes , expansion velocities and luminosities of the superbubbles and use these quantities to derive their shell density , mass , kinetic energy and age .",
    "the bubbles range between @xmath17150 - 500 pc in radius , with low shell densities and kinetic energy between a dozen and a few hundred supernovae .",
    "we use age determinations from the literature for the young clusters in this object and find that many of our bubbles have a matching age determination of a similar value , taking into account that the age we present is a lower limit assuming free expansion .",
    "* the expansion map shows not only the superbubbles but also extended detections which cover most of the galaxy and do not show enough spatial coherence to be identified as superbubbles . nevertheless , given that their expansion velocities are generally on the low side they should not originate in noise , but rather in spatially unresolved clusters .",
    "we make an estimate of the kinetic energy contained in this unresolved expansion with several approximations and find that it is of the same order as the energy in the bubbles , meaning that the biggest hii regions do not dominate the kinetic energy budget in this object .",
    "* to assess the validity of our results and check for bias in the determination of the physical properties we use hydrodynamic simulations to reproduce one of our bubbles using the physical parameters as inputs .",
    "we manage to reproduce a bubble with similar observational properties .",
    "projecting the simulation into a mock expansion map as our program would observe it shows a remarkably similar distribution of velocities due to projection effects , showing a slow decrease in observed expansion velocity before cutting off .",
    "this arises from the non - spherical shape of the bubble induced by the density profile of the disk . *",
    "the simulation also serves to check for bias in the physical parameter determination with our method , as we only probe the thinner , faster part of the shell which approaches us .",
    "we find that in this case the kinetic energy is overestimated by a factor 3 while the mass in underestimated by a factor 2 .",
    "* we also use long - slit observations of hii regions along the overlap zone to probe the ionization mechanisms in the expanding shells .",
    "a diagnostic on the ratio of forbidden lines [ sii]@xmath18 and [ nii]@xmath14 to h@xmath0 shows that photoionization dominates this process , though the forbidden line ratios are higher for the shells rather than the bulk of the hii region , showing that collisional excitation is more important in the shells .",
