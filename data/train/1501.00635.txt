    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) powered by accretion of material onto super - massive black holes ( smbhs ) are the most luminous and persistent sources of electromagnetic radiation in the universe . in the orientation - based unified models ( antonucci 1993 ;",
    "urry & padovani 1995 ) , the observed diversity of agn is ascribed to a few physical parameters , such as the orientation of accretion disk / torus and jet to the observer , the accretion rate , mass and angular momentum of the smbhs ( e.g. antonucci 1984 , osterbrock & pogge 1985 ; meier 1999 ; ghisellini et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the simple relativistic jet model ( blandford & rees 1978 ) has thus far been reasonably successful in accounting for the primary properties of radio - loud agns which constitute about 10 percent of the total . in the unified scheme of radio - loud agns",
    ", it is postulated that blazars are pole - on - viewed ( blandford & knigl 1979 ; antonucci & ulvestad 1985 ) and hence the radiations of blazars are overwhelming by the luminous and rapidly variable doppler - boosted jet emission ( ulrich et al .",
    "1997 ) . by comparison , radio - loud agns with misdirected jets ( i.e. , the misaligned agns ( magns ) including radio galaxies and steep spectrum radio quasars ( ssrqs ) ) exhibit steep radio spectra and bipolar or quasi - symmetrical radio structures .",
    "deboosted radio emissions from mildly relativistic outflows and/or extended radio lobes",
    "are significant for magns while the relativistic core radio emissions are dominated for blazars . ratio of these two components , @xmath2 $ ] ( which is also called the core dominance parameter , where @xmath3 represents the observed flux density ) , is routinely used for classification ( orr & browne 1982 ; hough & readhead 1989 ) .",
    "the lobe dominated quasars ( ldqs ) are special for ssrqs with @xmath4 .",
    "since the lobe emission should be orientation - unbiased , ldqs are widely used to test the unified scheme of radio - loud agns .",
    "the anti - correlation between @xmath5 and the projected linear size of jet @xmath6 in the complete sample of double - lobed radio quasars is consistent with the expectation that @xmath6 is foreshortened due to geometrical projection effect at small viewing angles ( hough & readhead 1989 ) .",
    "observation of parsec scale morphology of ldqs suggests that no counter jets are seen and the structural variations and the flux variability are mild ( hough et al .",
    "this phenomenon can be well understood via the orientation - dependent relativistic beaming scheme if such objects are viewed at intermediate angles .",
    "this argument is supported by the anti - correlation between @xmath5 and the width of the broad line emissions ( e.g. , baker & hunstead 1995 ) .",
    "thus , the orientation angles of ldqs can be restricted by these approaches , ranging from @xmath7 to @xmath8 ( aars et al . 2005 ) .",

    "recently , an analysis of 4-year lat data shows that the number of significantly detected @xmath0-ray magns is still handful ( di mauro et al .",
    "nevertheless , detecting the @xmath0-ray emissions from magns is attractive because they offer a different perspective to approach the high - energy phenomena than blazars ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003a ) . in 2fgl ,",
    "most @xmath0-ray detected magns are fanaroff - riley type ( fr , fanaroff & riley 1974 ) i radio galaxies whose @xmath0-ray emissions can be naturally explained by the structured jet radiation models ( georganopoulos & kazanas 2003b ; ghisellini et al .",
    "since they are relatively nearby , @xmath0-ray emission have been well detected in these sources despite of their large jet inclination angles and small @xmath5 values .",
    "on the other hand , no fr ii sources at relatively high redshifts viewed at large angles , such as strongly - lobe - dominated quasars ( @xmath9 ) , had been reported in 2fgl .",
    "the successful detection of @xmath0-ray emissions from ldqs is valuable because such data may bring us the structure information of the jets .",
    "not only the lobes of ldqs are capable of generating strong radio emissions , hotspots in the radio lobes are significant x - ray emitters ( e.g. massaro et al .",
    "moreover , the modeling of multi - wavelength spectral energy distributions ( seds ) of these hotspots suggests that they could be potential @xmath0-ray emitters ( e.g. zhang et al .",
    "the discovery of extended @xmath0-ray emission from nearby radio galaxy centaurus a is in support of such a hypothesis ( abdo et al .",
    "if @xmath0-ray emissions from the hotspots of some ldqs have been detected , they may consist of non - ignorable part of the extragalactic @xmath0-ray background ( egb ) and may be accelerators of ultra - high - energy comic rays ( rachen & biermann 1993 ; massaro & ajello 2011 ) .    in this work ,",

    "the spectrum of the core x - ray emission is very hard ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "such a hard spectrum can not be explained by the classic disk - corona scenario and hence x - ray jet component should be taken into account ( dou & yuan 2008 ) . moreover",
    ", the optical core emission has a linear polarization degree of @xmath108 ( wills et al .",
    "2011 ) , indicating that polarized synchrotron jet emission component is not negligible .",
    "we adopt the classic homogeneous lepton radiation model to calculate both the hotspot and core jet emissions ( see figure 9 ) , in which both the synchrotron and inverse compton scattering ( ic ) processes have been taken into account .",
    "the input parameters are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the radiating electrons are assumed to follow a broken power - law distribution and both self - synchrotron absorption and klein - nishina effects have been addressed ( detailed description please see liao et al 2014 ) . in the hotspot scenario , synchrotron plus synchrotron self - compton ( ssc ) without significant relativistic beaming ( @xmath109 ) and synchrotron plus ic / cmb process under mild relativistic condition are considered .",
    "interestingly , in the ssc model the observed @xmath0-ray spectrum well accords with the natural extension of the x - ray data , see figure 9a . and physical parameters from sed modeling are consistent with those found in zhang et al .",
    "in contrast , the ic / cmb model can not well describe the x - ray and @xmath0-ray emissions simultaneously ( see also zhang et al .",
    "2010 ) . in the core radiation scenario , synchrotron plus ssc+ic / ir model under a mild relativistic condition",
    "is adopted .",
    "such an approach is motivated by the vlba polarimetry observations of several ldqs that polarization of their parsec scale jets are higher than their cores , indicating that the parsec scale jets point closer to our line of sight and hence are less obscured by a faraday screen ( aars & hough 2005 ) .",

    "the location of the @xmath0-ray emission is important for understanding the energy dissipation of magns .",
    "very high energy @xmath0-ray flare of m87 has been found to be simultaneous to an x - ray flare associated with the innermost knot of the jet ( harris et al .",
    "2006 ) , or a radio flare produced within 10 schwarzschild radii from the central smbh ( acciari et al .",
    "in addition , significant @xmath0-ray emissions both from the extensive structure and the central core of centaurus a have been detected ( abdo et al . 2010b ; abdo et al .",
    "nevertheless , there is increasing evidence that the location of @xmath0-ray emission of magn is near the central engine .",
    "the variability of @xmath0-ray emissions from magns suggests that the contribution of @xmath0-ray emission from the radio hotspot / lobe is unimportant ( e.g. grandi et al .",

    "the @xmath0-ray emission and the the multi - wavelength hotspot radiation of pictor a are hard to explain self - consistently ( brown & adams 2012 ) . moreover , @xmath0-ray radiation locations of 3c 111 and 3c 120 are only @xmath140.5 pc from the central smbh , as constrained by simultaneous multi - wavelength observation ( grandi et al .",
    ", 2012 ; tanaka et al . , 2015 ) .",
    "3c 275.1 is also an ideal target for simultaneous multi - wavelength variability study since the @xmath0-ray radiation location of ssrqs is still unclear .",
    "the phenomenon that the ejection of super - luminous knot is coupled with a dip in x - ray light curve of some nearby blrgs ( e.g. chatterjee et al .",

    "doppler beaming effect is believed to be crucial for producing @xmath0-ray emission of agn .",
    "many pieces of evidence , such as rapid @xmath0-ray variations at timescale of hours and minutes ( e.g. liao & bai 2015 ) , suggest that @xmath0-ray emissions of blazars are from the pc scale inner jets pointing to us .",
    "however , magns tend to have milder @xmath0-ray variability and slower knot apparent speeds than blazars , consistent with their observed large jet inclination angles .",

    "( 2011 ) proposed a gradient lorentz scenario that observers at different viewing angles see different speed portions of the jet and hence the @xmath0-ray spectra of fri radio galaxies are softer than bl lac objects . on the other hand , for the frii sources and in particular the ssrqs ,",
    "they occupy the typical fsrqs region ( abdo et al .",
    "the isotropic @xmath0-ray luminosity of 3c 275.1 is @xmath16 @xmath112 erg @xmath40 , again in the fsrqs region ( see also figure 9 ) .",
    "ssrqs are suggested to be more strongly doppler boosted when comparing with radio galaxies .",
    "indeed , significant @xmath0-ray variabilities of 3c 380 and 3c 207 are detected , and their observed super - luminal motion are over @xmath113 , in accordance with their relatively small jet inclination angle of @xmath14@xmath7 ( torresi & grandi 2013 ) .",
    "it is somewhat puzzling that 3c 275.1 , a source with a large jet inclination angle ( @xmath14@xmath114 ) according to its relatively low @xmath5 value , is @xmath0-ray luminous ( @xmath16 @xmath112 erg @xmath40 ) .",
    "however , if its pc jet is bending to us , the actual angle between the @xmath0-ray emission region of 3c 275.1 and the line of sight can be smaller , possibly @xmath14@xmath7 . except the ssrqs , there are a few fr ii radio galaxies detected by _",
    "fermi_/lat , e.g. 3c 111 and pictor a. they are less @xmath0-ray luminous than ssrqs , as shown in figure 9 , probably due to the milder relativistic beaming effect by their relatively larger jet inclination angle of @xmath14@xmath114 ( jorstad et al . , 2005 ) . significant difference of the @xmath0-ray spectral index between the frii radio galaxies and frii ssrqs are not found , in accordance with the argument in meyer et al .",
