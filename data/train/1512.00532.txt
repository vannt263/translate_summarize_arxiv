    "the study of periodically driven systems has seen a resurgence in recent years , appearing in many different contexts such as : periodic drive as a means for realizing myriad topological phases  @xcite , as non - energy conserving examples of systems exhibiting many - body - localization  @xcite , and as examples of systems that can support novel collective behavior absent in static hamiltonians  @xcite .",
    "while plenty of physical insight can be gained by mapping the time - dependent hamiltonian into an effective time - independent hamiltonian ( the floquet hamiltonian ) that captures the time - evolution over one period  @xcite , ultimately it is the distribution function of the particles that needs to be properly accounted for in order to understand how much of the physics extracted simply from a spectral analysis of the floquet hamiltonian , survives .",
    "the distribution function depends on the dominant relaxation mechanisms , i.e. , whether it is a good approximation to think of the periodically driven system to be isolated from its surroundings so that the drive switch on protocol or the interactions between particles determine the distribution function .",
    "@xcite in contrast it could also be that the the system is coupled to external leads , but is short in comparison to electron - electron or electron - phonon ( el - ph ) scattering lengths , so that it is the leads that impose the occupation probabilities  @xcite .",
    "finally another commonly encountered example is inelastic relaxation due to the system being coupled to an external reservoir  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we consider the last case discussed above , namely a periodically driven open system , where the inelastic scattering with a reservoir determines the distribution function",
    ". we will be interested in a circularly polarized drive which when applied to graphene , opens up a topologically non - trivial gap at the dirac points , inducing a chern insulator  @xcite .",
    "our work here differs from our previous work on a similar system  @xcite in that , we in this work specifically consider the case where one is close to a topological phase transition , so that the separation between quasi - energy bands are comparable to the coupling to an external reservoir .",
    "our past work was in the opposite limit where the quasi - energy level spacings were large as compared to coupling to an external reservoir , and thus we were far from any topological phase transitions .",
    "one of the main new results in this regime is that we find an effective reservoir induced coherence where the steady - state involves non - zero off - diagonal elements of the floquet density matrix that grow with the strength of the coupling to the reservoir , while the diagonal elements are relatively weakly affected .",
    "this leads to an effective reduced density matrix @xmath0 which becomes purer i.e. , @xmath1 $ ] increases with the coupling to the reservoir .",
    "another new ingredient in this work is that , while it is known that generic driven dissipative systems reach steady - states that can not be described by an effective temperature , and hence do not resemble a gibbs distribution  @xcite , in this work we characterize this lack of detailed balance by a net steady - state entropy production rate .",
    "we prove that in the steady - state where the density matrix has synchronized with the external drive , the entropy production mainly depends on the off - diagonal components of the density matrix .",
    "thus the more coherent the system becomes , the larger is the entropy production rate .",
    "this is not paradoxical because the steady - state entropy production rate equals the heat current flowing out of the system and into the reservoir .",
    "thus the more efficient this flow is , the more effective the system is in maintaining coherence .",
    "we obtain analytic expressions in the vicinity of the dirac point , and use this to highlight the above general observations .",
    "our results also indicate how a reservoir can be engineered to control the entropy production rate . in fact enhancing",
    "the latter can cause the system to settle into more coherent and possibly even dark states where @xmath1=1 $ ] .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ model ]",
    "we describe the model and outline the derivation of the floquet - master equation , highlighting the approximations that fail once quasi - energy level spacings become small . in section  [ dms ]",
    "we discuss our results for the reduced density matrix and extract the occupation probabilities of the floquet quasi - energy levels , while in section  [ entropy ] we quantify the lack of detailed balance in terms of a steady - state entropy production rate .",
    "finally we conclude in section  [ concl ] .",
    "some details are relegated to the appendices .",
    "appendix  [ appa ] shows that all the components of the steady - state density matrix is synchronized with the laser frequency .",
    "appendix  [ appb ] derives a general relation between the entropy production rate and the steady - state density matrix , and shows by means of an analytic calculation at the dirac point , that the entropy production rate is mainly controlled by the off - diagonal components of the density matrix .",
    "appendix  [ appc ] provides details needed for arriving at the analytic expressions at the dirac point .",
    "in the vicinity of a laser induced topological phase transition in graphene , we may approximate graphene as dirac fermions under a periodic drive . this model can also alternately describe a laser applied to the 2d surface states of a 3d topological insulator ( ti )  @xcite .",

    "such a symmetry is broken by terms proportional to @xmath14 .    in the absence of electron - phonon coupling ,",
    "the problem is exactly solvable , where the time - evolution from time @xmath17 to @xmath18 is @xmath19 , @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 are the quasi - energies , and @xmath23 are the time - periodic quasi - modes .",
    "the quasi - modes and quasi - energies satisfy the following eigenvalue equation @xmath24 where @xmath25 , is known as the floquet hamiltonian .",
    "note that it is the combination @xmath26 that obeys the time - dependent schrdinger equation for @xmath27 , and since we are considering a two - level hamiltonian at every momentum @xmath28 , there are only two distinct solutions that we label as @xmath29 .",
    "once the system is coupled to phonons , the problem is not exactly solvable , and in fact on integrating out the phonon modes , it is straightforward to see that we have an interacting electron problem .",
    "we make progress by making certain assumptions : that the coupling to the phonons is weak , only inter - band transitions between the quasi - energy levels are allowed ( i.e , @xmath30 is peaked at @xmath31 ) , and that the phonons are always in thermal equilibrium at the temperature @xmath11 .    our assumption for neglecting intra - band transitions is based on the fact that these occur on longer time scales than inter - band transitions .",
    "this is because the energy exchange for the former is smaller than the latter , and also because typical electron - phonon matrix elements is stronger for optical phonons compared with acoustic phonons  @xcite .",
    "thus there is an intermediate time - scale where the results obtained purely from inter - band transitions will be valid . in the next section , we outline the derivation of the floquet - master equation based on these assumptions .     along @xmath32 , and compared with the dirac spectrum in the absence of the laser .",

    "it is clear that @xmath71 is the fermi - golden rule rate for making a transition from quasi - energy level @xmath72 to @xmath73 by phonon absorption or emission . since @xmath74",
    ", we see that this rate includes processes that change the electronic state ( @xmath75 ) as well as floquet - umpklapp processes where the electron state remains the same @xmath76 , but the system absorbs or emits phonons at energy @xmath77 .",
    "as we shall later discuss , the latter processes are particularly important for achieving reservoir induced coherence as they take away the energy being supplied by the periodic drive without changing the electronic state ( since @xmath76 ) .",
    "if we had relaxed the assumption that the phonons were in equilibrium at temperature @xmath11 , then the functions @xmath78 entering the rates would have been unknown , and a separate kinetic equation would have to be written for them , leading to a complex electron - phonon coupled boltzmann equation .",
    "we now mention some additional commonly made assumptions to further simplify the rate equation  .",
    "when the separation between quasi - energy levels is large as compared to the coupling to the reservoir , the off - diagonal matrix elements of the density matrix in the floquet basis become small , and can be neglected  @xcite . in this case , the steady - state solution for the density matrix , even though it bears little resemblance to a gibbs distribution ( unless of course the frequency of the laser is large as compared to the electron band - width ) , is independent of the electron - reservoir coupling .",
    "@xcite the simplest way to see this lack of dependence on the coupling is to notice that when the off - diagonal elements of the density matrix are zero in eq .  , the diagonal - elements at steady - state are given by the ratio of some combination of the rates @xmath63 . since",
    "each @xmath63 depend on the electron - phonon coupling by being proportional to @xmath79 , the coupling dependence falls off in the steady - state result for the density matrix when @xmath80 . when @xmath81 , the result depends on the coupling only via the asymmetry ratio @xmath82 .",
    "the resulting distribution at steady - state is isotropic in momentum space when @xmath83 , while it can be anisotropic in momentum space for @xmath81 .",
    "in addition , if the coupling to the reservoir is small in comparison to the drive frequency @xmath84 , then the steady - state density matrix varies slowly over one cycle of the drive . in this case",
    ", one may make the `` modified rotating wave approximation ''  @xcite which involves replacing the scattering rates @xmath85 by their average over one cycle .",
    "we call this case the time - averaged floquet - master equation . in",

    "we also set the phonon density of states to be uniform and equal to @xmath87 .",
    "thus we assume that we have non - zero phonon density of states at all relevant energy - scales .",
    "we supplement these results with analytic results at @xmath34 that highlight how the energy - dependence of the phonon density of states affect the steady - state .",
    "we present our numerical results for phonon temperature @xmath88 and three different reservoir coupling strengths @xmath89 and in those cases where the results are weakly dependent on @xmath90 , we only present the results for @xmath91 .",
    "we also fix the laser amplitude to @xmath92 .",
    "the corresponding quasi - energy spectra plotted within the 1st floquet brillouin zone ( fbz ) ( @xmath93 ) is shown in fig .",

    "this curve can be compared with the dashed - line in this plot which illustrates an ideal repeated dirac band structure in the floquet zone . for weak laser frequencies ( @xmath94 ) ,",
    "we expect resonances at @xmath95 , with this condition shifting as the laser amplitude increases .",
    "the resonances are reflected by the narrowing of the quasi - energy level spacings at these @xmath28 points , and in what follows , special attention will be given to the occupation probabilities in the vicinity of these points , showing that the off - diagonal components of the density matrix also become larger here .",
    "the master equation , eq .  , is a linear ordinary differential equation ( ode ) of order one with time dependent coefficients . from ode theory we know that such differential equations have closed solutions . while our results are based on numerical simulations of these equations , and an analytic solution at @xmath34 ,",
    "there are some general features in the steady - state of these solutions which we discuss in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "in particular one can show that in the steady - state which is reached after an initial transient whose duration is controlled by @xmath96 , the density matrix synchronizes with the laser field .",
    "thus the only oscillations remaining in the system are those with frequency @xmath84 and its multiples .",
    "this can at first seem counter - intuitive especially for off - diagonal components of the density matrix because one may naively expect from the term @xmath97 on the left hand side of the master equation eq .",
    ", that the off - diagonal components must oscillate with the frequency @xmath98 . as explained in the appendix  [ appa ] , while this is valid initially , in the steady - state these oscillations decay due to the presence of the electron - phonon coupling terms on the right hand side of the master equation .",
    "therefore in the steady - state we can expand the density matrix via a fourier series @xmath99 where the superscript @xmath100 , denotes the steady - state .",

    "in fact as we show in appendix  [ appa ] , in a floquet - master equation with a time - averaged @xmath63 , the steady - state oscillations of @xmath116 disappear .",

    "@xcite in an earlier paper we discussed  @xcite the spin texture for the floquet - dirac system when only diagonal components of the density matrix are kept . with the inclusion of off - diagonal terms as done here , we find that a qualitatively new feature is a dependence of the results on the coupling strength to a reservoir . while this dependence is weak for the parameters we have chosen , near a topological phase transition , where the levels come even closer together , the reservoir dependence of @xmath140 will become more enhanced .    as the coupling strength to the reservoir",

    "in particular , this coherence arises due to floquet - umklapp processes that allow the electron to release energy at multiples of the drive without causing transitions between distinct electronic states , where the latter processes would be akin to decoherence .",
    "the signature of this coherence is a non - zero off - diagonal matrix element in the floquet basis that grows with the strength of the coupling to the reservoir , while the diagonal component is only weakly affected by the coupling strength to the reservoir .",

    "an entropy production rate is equivalent to the heat released by the system , this result can be used to engineer the phonon reservoir such that the system can efficiently give up heat to the reservoir , becoming more coherent .",
    "furthermore we find that the entropy production rate increases with coupling to the reservoir , and also when one is closer to resonances , where the quasi - energy level spacings become small .    due to the synchronization of the system",

    "all the above results are supplemented by exact analytic expressions at the dirac point which highlight the complex interplay of the many energy scales in the problem : system - reservoir coupling , reservoir temperature , frequency of the laser , amplitude of the laser , and quasi - energies .",
    "consequently one can use these different energy scales to find a criterion to maximize coherence .",
    "the results for the floquet occupation probabilities , and in particular their dependence on the strength of the system - reservoir coupling , can be tested in experiments such as time - resolved and spin - resolved arpes .    at this point ,",
    "a note of caution is in order .",
    "we find that the markovian approximation that relies on a weak - coupling to the reservoir , breaks down for large momentum and for very small level crossings relative to the coupling to the reservoir . for our parameters",

    "this we consider the case where it is a permissible approximation to replace @xmath223 with its mean value .",
    "this requires that the temporal oscillations of @xmath223 around its mean value be comparatively small , which corresponds to small electron - phonon coupling constants and momentum . in such cases one can verify by numerical simulations that the steady - state solutions of the original floquet - master equation with a time - dependent rate matrix , after averaging over time yields the same answer as the solutions of the time - averaged floquet - master equation with @xmath236 .",

    "<S> results are presented for an open floquet topological system represented by dirac fermions coupled to a circularly polarized laser and an external reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that when the separation between quasi - energy bands becomes small , and comparable to the coupling strength to the reservoir , the reduced density matrix in the floquet basis , even at steady - state , has non - zero off - diagonal elements , with the magnitude of the off - diagonal elements increasing with the strength of the coupling to the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the coupling to the reservoir only weakly affects the diagonal elements , hence inducing an effective coherence . </S>",
    "<S> the steady - state reduced density matrix synchronizes with the periodic drive , and a fourier analysis allows the extraction of the occupation probabilities of the floquet quasi - energy levels . </S>",
    "<S> the lack of detailed balance at steady - state is quantified in terms of an entropy production rate , and it is shown that this equals the heat current flowing out of the system , and into the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> it is also shown that the entropy production rate mainly depends on the off - diagonal components of the floquet density matrix . </S>",
    "<S> thus a stronger coupling to the reservoir leads to an enhanced entropy production rate , implying a more efficient removal of heat from the system , which in turn helps the system maintain coherence . </S>",
    "<S> analytic expressions in the vicinity of the dirac point are derived which highlights these results , and also indicates how the reservoir may be engineered to enhance the coherence of the system . </S>"
