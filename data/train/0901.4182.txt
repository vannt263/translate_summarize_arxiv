    "over the past two decades , the exploration of the shot noise accompanying charge currents in mesoscopic conductors has become one of the major tools for gathering information about microscopic mechanisms of transport and temporal correlations between charge carriers which can not be extracted from traditional measurements of time - averaged quantities  @xcite .",
    "such nonequilibrium time - dependent fluctuations arise due to the discreetness of the electrical charge , persist down to zero temperature , and require stochasticity induced by either quantum - mechanical  @xcite backscattering of charge carriers ( as in mesoscopic and nanoscopic devices ) or by random injection process ( as in the textbook example of a schottky vacuum tube where cathode emits electrons randomly and independently )",
    ".    theoretical description of the shot noise is typically formulated in terms of current fluctuations in a conductor with a non - fluctuating bias voltage applied between the contacts  @xcite . for zero bias voltage @xmath1 , or in macroscopic systems where electrons thermalize in a short time to remain near equilibrium even under finite @xmath2 , one observes thermal noise .",
    "this equilibrium noise vanishes at @xmath3 and , being directly related to the conductance through the fluctuation - dissipation theorem , does not give any new information  @xcite .",
    "the situation changes when time it takes for an electron to equilibrate becomes comparable to the time of flight through the conductor , which can be achieved by reducing the size of the system or by lowering the temperature . in this limit ,",
    "nonequilibrium effects become essential and the relevant energy scale for the noise is set by the bias voltage @xmath4 rather than the temperature @xmath5  @xcite . at low frequencies , the nonequilibrium current noise is dominated by time - dependent conductance fluctuations ( arising from the random motion of impurities ) , termed `` 1/f noise '' because of the characteristic frequency dependence of their spectral density which is quadratic function of the mean ( i.e. , time - averaged ) current @xmath6 . at higher frequencies , two principal signatures signifying the shot noise emerge  noise spectral density linearly",
    "depends on current while being frequency - independent .",
    "macroscopic metallic conductors typically exhibit thermal noise , but no shot noise  in wires of length @xmath7 longer than the temperature - dependent inelastic electron - phonon scattering length @xmath8 , the shot noise power is expected to be reduced by a factor @xmath9 ( @xmath10 )  @xcite when electron - phonon interaction are able to efficiently drain extra energy from the electron subsystem to bring it closer to local thermal equilibrium  @xcite . while this leads to _ a priori _ assumption of vanishing nonequilibrium noise  @xcite in macroscopic metallic samples , which is typically confirmed experimentally  @xcite , finite shot noise can be encountered in specific devices that are much longer than @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , inelastic electron - electron scattering , which persists to much lower temperatures than electron - phonon scattering , does not suppress shot noise , but slightly enhances the noise power  @xcite .",
    "the low sensitivity of the shot noise to electron - electron scattering is due to its inability to drain the external - electric - field - supplied energy from the electron subsystem , so that shot noise may be considered as a direct result of such deviation from equilibrium  @xcite .    the zero - frequency shot noise spectral density @xmath11 of conventional unpolarized charge current in two - terminal _ non - interacting _ conductors reaches the maximum value @xmath12 ( the poissonian limit ) when transport is determined by uncorrelated stochastic processes .",
    "this is the situation encountered in modern tunnel junctions or vacuum tubes explored in the early 1900s where the mean occupation of a state is so small that the pauli principle is inoperative . on the other hand , correlations among electrons",
    "reduce the noise @xmath13 , where the dominant source of correlations is the pauli principle preventing double occupancy of an electronic state .",
    "while coulomb repulsion is another source of correlations , in a metal it is strongly screened and ineffective .",
    "nevertheless , electron - electron interactions in specific setups ( e.g. , involving various regimes under the coulomb blockade condition  @xcite , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite ) can lead to experimental observation of the super - poissonian @xmath14 shot noise  @xcite .",
    "for some of the basic types of two - terminal nanostructures , the fano factor characterizing the transport of non - interacting quasiparticles assumes universal values  @xcite ( i.e. , independent of the details of the system , such as impurity distribution , band structure , and shape of the conductor ) : @xmath15 for a symmetric double barrier ; @xmath16 for a diffusive wire ; @xmath17 for a dirty interface ; @xmath18 for a symmetric ballistic chaotic cavity ; and @xmath19 for a ballistic conductor ( e.g. , quantum point contact in the plateau regime of its quantized conductance ) .",
    "these sub - poissonian results have been confirmed experimentally  @xcite and derived theoretically by various approaches  @xcite  they are considered to be semiclassical in nature ( in the sense that they can be reproduced via approaches based on the boltzmann equation with langevin random forces  @xcite ) where quantum mechanics enters through the calculation of transmission eigenvalues or the fermi statistics of electrons .",
    "the notion of noise can be generalized to multiterminal conductors  @xcite where temporal correlations calculated between currents in different terminals are always negative due to electrons obeying the fermi statistics  @xcite .",
    "interestingly enough , the mature field of the shot noise of non - interacting particles has been revived very recently by the studies of ballistic transport through evanescent ( i.e. , exponentially decaying ) modes in two - terminal graphene nanoribbons where the scattering theory predicts @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "this surprising result , which is accidentally  @xcite the same as the fano factor for transport through diffusive semiconductor or metallic wires , has been confirmed experimentally in large aspect ratio ( width @xmath20 length ) graphene samples  @xcite .",
    "however , it is not universally applicable to all graphene nanoribbons with different types of edges or contacts with metallic electrodes  @xcite .",
    "it is also genuinely quantum - mechanical feature since it requires classically forbidden evanescent wave functions that decay exponentially from metallic electrodes into the graphene sample .",
    "an example of underlying physics revealed by the fano factor of the shot noise , such as @xmath16 for diffusive wires  @xcite or @xmath17 for dirty interfaces  @xcite , is the interplay of randomness in quantum - mechanical impurity scattering and the pauli blocking imposed by the fermi statistics of transported quasiparticles . in both of these cases , the fano factor confirms bimodal distributions  @xcite of the transmission eigenvalues of the device .",
    "similarly , in chaotic ballistic quantum dots stochasticity is introduced by electron scattering at its irregularly shaped boundaries .",
    "nevertheless , the fano factor reaches @xmath21  @xcite only in the fully developed quantum regime where electron dwell time @xmath22 is greater than the ehrenfest time @xmath23 ( @xmath23 is roughly equal to the time it takes for the chaotic classical dynamics to stretch an initially narrow wave packet , of the size of the fermi wavelength , to some relevant classical length scale  @xcite ) . the shot noise of chaotic quantum dots is reduced below @xmath21 in the classical - to - quantum crossover regime @xmath24 , where it depends sensitively on the degree of chaoticity thereby allowing one to extract its lyapunov exponent  @xcite .",

    "@xcite , and extensively covered in ref .",
    "@xcite and its `` update '' ref .",

    "ferromagnetic sources ( for simplicity often assumed to be half - metallic ferromagnets  @xcite ) inject spin - polarized charge current into a paramagnetic central region where spin - dependent interactions affect spin dynamics in the course of transport of electrons to which spins are attached .",
    "for example , mishchenko  @xcite analyzed shot noise in diffusive spin valves for parallel and antiparallel magnetizations of their ferromagnetic electrodes , finding setups with significant increase of the fano factor ( when compared to conventional diffusive wires with @xmath16 ) caused by generic spin - flip scattering .",
    "lamacraft  @xcite calculated the effect of spin - orbit coupling , magnetic impurities , and precession in an external magnetic field on the noise in the experimentally relevant cases of diffusive wires and lateral semiconductor dots , finding possible _ dramatic enhancements _ and `` enhancement '' of spin - dependent shot noise is considered to be any value @xmath25 .",
    "] of the fano factor . through the specific values of the fano factor enhancement ,",
    "different types of spin - flip mechanisms leave distinctive signatures on the shot noise of injected spin - polarized charge currents , thereby making it possible to extract the spin relaxation times due to different microscopic mechanisms from electrical noise measurements in open mesoscopic systems  @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , nagaev and glazman studied finite frequency shot noise in spin valves which originates from random spin flips due to so - dependent scattering and magnetic impurities .",
    "although the latter mechanism does not contribute to the average current , and its effect on the noise is smaller than that of so scattering , it can be distinguished by a unique low - frequency noise dispersion that results from impurity - spin reorientations . by studying the shot noise of spin - polarized current injected into a diffusive ferromagnetic wires attached to two half - metallic ferromagnetic electrodes via tunnel contacts , hatami and zareyan  @xcite demonstrated how the enhanced shot noise ( most conspicuous when",
    "the electrodes are perfectly polarized in opposite directions ) can probe the intrinsic density of states and the extrinsic impurity scattering contributions to the current polarization of the wire .",
    "similar studies for the multiterminal spin valve - type devices by zareyan and belzig  @xcite also encountered enhanced ( when compared to the values in identical devices but with paramagnetic electrodes ) shot noise and cross - correlations measured between currents in two different ferromagnetic terminals .",
    "the enhancement depends on the relative orientation of the magnetization of electrodes , the degree of spin polarization of the terminals , and the strength of the spin - flip scattering in the normal central region .",
    "this makes it possible to determine the spin - flip scattering rate by changing the polarization of the ferromagnetic terminals  @xcite .",
    "these results emphasize how enhanced fano factor of the shot noise of spin - polarized electrons is capable of unearthing additional mechanisms of current fluctuations , as well as temporal correlations between carriers of opposite spin , which are not visible in the conventional noise of unpolarized currents .",
    "this is due to the fact that any spin flip converts spin-@xmath26 subsystem particle into a spin-@xmath27 subsystem particle , where the two subsystems differ when spin degeneracy if lifted .",
    "the non - conservation of the number of particles in each subsystem as the origin of an additional source of current fluctuations is analogous to more familiar example of fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in random optical media due to non - conservation of the number of photons  @xcite .",
    "microscopically , spin - flips are either instantaneous events generated by the collision of electrons with magnetic impurities and so - dependent scattering off static disorder  @xcite , or continuous spin precession  @xcite during electron free propagation in magnetic fields imposed externally or effectively generated by the intrinsic so couplings  @xcite associated with electronic band structure . unlike the external magnetic field , the `` internal '' magnetic field @xmath28 corresponding to the intrinsic so couplings is momentum dependent , does not break the time - reversal invariance  @xcite , and it is capable of spin - splitting the energy bands .    in ref .",
    "@xcite we addressed two key problems for the shot noise in two - terminal nanostructures with intrinsic so coupling illustrated by the device setup in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] : what is the connection between the fano factor and the degree of quantum coherence @xmath29 of transported spins ?",

    "besides the shot noise of spin - polarized charge currents , the shot noise of spin currents  @xcite , including the noise  @xcite of the _ pure _ ones which are not accompanied by any net charge flux  @xcite , has attracted considerable theoretical attention .",
    "for instance , sauret and feinberg  @xcite used examples of several interacting mesoscopic devices , in which the average current is not spin polarized and spin degeneracy is not lifted , to argue how shot noise of spin currents can probe attractive or repulsive interactions between quasiparticles , as well as how it can measure the spin relaxation time @xmath33 without the need to employ external magnetic fields .",
    "zareyan and belzig  @xcite analyzed three - terminal spin valve setup , consisting of a normal diffusive wire which is connected by tunnel contacts to two oppositely polarized ferromagnetic terminals in one end and to another ferromagnetic terminal on the other end , to demonstrate how the shot noise of spin current in such a device is much more sensitive than charge current noise to spin - flip scattering rate in the normal wire .",

    "@xcite computed the shot noise of pure spin current generated by pumping device ( without any bias voltage applied between its two electrodes ) driven by time - dependent external magnetic field , pointing out to a difference between cross- ( between spin currents in different electrodes ) and auto - correlation ( between spin currents in the same electrode ) noise that are , otherwise , identical for conventional charge currents .",
    "although the net charge current in this device is zero , there is still non - zero shot noise of charge current due to the opposite flow of spin-@xmath26 and spin-@xmath27 electrons in the course of pure spin current induction  @xcite .",
    "section  [ sec : she_noise_intro ] introduces the topic of the shot noise of pure spin and zero charge currents generated by the mesoscopic spin hall effect  @xcite in multiterminal nanostructures with so couplings .",

    "[ sec : she_noise ] and physical insights brought by this recently initiated type of analysis  @xcite . in sec .",
    "[ sec : qidshe ] , we apply the same type of analysis to multiply - connected ( i.e. , ring - shaped ) devices attached to four electrodes where noise can probe spin - dependent quantum interference effects on transport .    among the studies of the spin - dependent shot noise , a subject that has evolved into a vast subfield  @xcite on its own ( and outside of the scope of this review ) deals with current fluctuations and temporal correlations in nanoscale conducting islands ( such as quantum dots , carbon nanotubes , and magnetic molecules ) attached to ferromagnetic electrodes  @xcite .",
    "in such devices , an interplay between coulomb blockade and spin accumulation takes place with shot noise offering tools to probe various aspects of its phenomenology that can not be extracted from mean current  @xcite .",
    "another set of topics which involves spin - dependent shot noise , and is better suited for a separate review  @xcite in the context of spin qubits for quantum computing , is the shot noise probing  @xcite of two - electron spin - entangled states .      despite increasing theoretical activity on the spin - dependent shot noise in recent years ,",
    "only few experiments have been performed , mostly focusing on the shot noise in magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtj ) .",
    "while high magnetoresistance of mtjs makes them well - suited for fine magnetic field sensors , their low - frequency operation is limited by the presence of a relatively large @xmath34 noise  @xcite .",
    "although the shot noise is not the most important among noise sources  @xcite as the key limiting factor  @xcite for mtj applications , it is a sensitive tool to probe properties of different types of insulating barriers  @xcite responsible for tunneling .",
    "for example , measurement of the fano factor of spin - dependent shot noise in mtjs with mgo insulating barrier can be employed to test the quality ( i.e. , presence of impurities or imperfections ) of epitaxially grown crystalline mtjs  obtaining poissonian limit @xmath12 signals pure spin - dependent direct tunneling and validates high structural quality of the mgo barrier  @xcite . in ref .",

    "the crucial role played by the so interactions in all - electrical control of spin in semiconductor nanostructures  @xcite has also provoked recent studies of their effects on the shot noise .",
    "for example , the rashba so coupling  @xcite induced by structural inversion asymmetry of the semiconductor heterostructure hosting the 2deg can be tuned by a gate electrode covering the device  @xcite .",
    "this is envisaged as a key ingredient of the `` second generation '' spintronic devices  @xcite , such as semiconductor - based spin transistors that manipulate propagating coherent spin states  @xcite .    in a pioneering work on the shot noise in rashba so coupled systems , egues _ et al . _",

    "using the same device one can probe injected two - electron spin - entangled states  @xcite where rashba coupling coherently rotates spin states to modulate the noise signal  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that shot noise in ballistic chaotic cavities is suppressed when electrons follow classical deterministic trajectories during dwell time @xmath38 shorter than the ehrenfest time @xmath23  @xcite . in such cases , the electron wave packet entering the quantum dot is either fully transmitted or fully reflected , so that shot noise remains zero ( @xmath39 ) due to absence of any quantum - mechanically - induced randomness  @xcite",
    ". however , ossipov _ et al . _",
    "@xcite demonstrated , using an example of a ballistic dot in a shape of a stadium billiard with the rashba so coupling , that so interactions can be solely responsible for the non - zero fano factor in the regime @xmath24 .",
    "this arises due to the transfer of quantum mechanical uncertainty in the spin of the electron to its position via the so coupling , which causes a breakdown of deterministic classical dynamics .",
    "shangguan and wang pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that both auto - correlation and cross - correlation noise are required to characterize fluctuations of spin current in double quantum dots with the rashba so interaction .",

    "l and guo  @xcite investigated the shot noise in quantum dot in the kondo regime where the rashba coupling is present in the dot only and the dot is embedded in one arm of the aharonov - bohm ring .",
    "when bias voltage is applied across the two leads attached to the ring , spin - polarized current flows through the dot whose shot noise is greatly affected by changing the rashba coupling .    several other studies  @xcite have computed the spin - resolved shot noise for ballistic charge transport through datta - das spin field - effect transistor ( spin - fet )  @xcite , composed of two ferromagnetic electrodes sandwiching a semiconductor quasi - one - dimensional wire with the rashba so coupling , to find the oscillatory noise behavior as the function of different parameters of the spin - fet .      the recently discovered spin hall effect ( she )  @xcite in paramagnetic semiconductor  @xcite and metallic  @xcite systems holds great promise to revolutionize electrical generation , control , and detection of nonequilibrium spin populations in the envisioned `` second generation '' spintronic devices  @xcite .",
    "the she actually denotes a _ collection _",
    "@xcite of phenomena manifesting as transverse ( with respect to injected unpolarized charge current ) separation of spin-@xmath26 and spin-@xmath27 states , which then comprise either a pure spin current or accumulate at the lateral sample boundaries .",

    "while she does not require external magnetic field , it essentially relies on the so coupling effects in solids .",
    "in addition , its magnitude can depend on the type of microscopic so interaction , impurities , charge density , geometry , and dimensionality .",
    "such a variety of she manifestations poses immense challenge for attempts at a unified theoretical description of spin transport in the presence of relativistic effects , which has not been resolved by early hopes  @xcite that auxiliary spin current operator @xmath40 ( for @xmath41-spins transported along the @xmath42-axis ) and spin conductivity @xmath43 ( as the linear response to longitudinal electric field @xmath44 ) of infinite homogeneous systems could be elevated to universally applicable and experimentally relevant quantities .",
    "thus , the key task emerging for theoretical analysis is to provide guidance for increasing and controlling the spin accumulation in confined geometries  @xcite ( observed she in semiconductors is presently rather small",

    "the extrinsic ones are fixed and the corresponding much smaller she is hardly controllable ( except through charge density and mobility  @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we review recent studies of the shot noise of spin - polarized charge currents and pure spin currents in multiterminal semiconductor nanostructures , while focusing on the effects brought by the intrinsic rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling and/or extrinsic so scattering off impurities in two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) based devices . by generalizing the scattering theory of quantum shot noise to include the full spin - density matrix of electrons injected from a spin - filtering electrode , we show how decoherence and dephasing in the course of spin precession can lead to substantial enhancement of the fano factor ( noise - to - current ratio ) of spin - polarized charge currents . </S>",
    "<S> these processes are suppressed by decreasing the width of the diffusive rashba wire , so that purely electrical measurement of the shot noise in a ferromagnet@xmath0so - coupled - diffusive - wire@xmath0paramagnet setup can quantify the degree of quantum coherence of transported spin through a remarkable one - to - one correspondence between the purity of the spin state and the fano factor . in four - terminal </S>",
    "<S> so - coupled nanostructures , injection of unpolarized charge current through the longitudinal leads is responsible not only for the pure spin hall current in the transverse leads , but also for nonequilibrium random time - dependent current fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the shot noise of transverse pure spin hall current and zero charge current , or transverse spin current and non - zero charge hall current , driven by unpolarized or spin - polarized injected longitudinal charge current , respectively , reveals a unique experimental tool to differentiate between the intrinsic rashba and extrinsic so mechanisms underlying the spin hall effect in 2deg devices . </S>",
    "<S> when the intrinsic mechanisms responsible for spin precession start to dominate the spin hall effect , they also enhance the shot noise of transverse spin and charge transport in multiterminal geometries . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we discuss the shot noise of transverse spin and zero charge currents in the quantum - interference - driven spin hall effect in ballistic four - terminal aharonov - casher rings realized using high - mobility 2deg with the rashba so coupling . </S>",
    "<S> the modulation of the rashba coupling by the gate electrode imprints the oscillatory signature of constructive and destructive spin interference around the ring on both the spin and charge shot noise , which differ from the corresponding oscillations of the spin hall conductance , thereby revealing quantum - interference - driven temporal correlations between spin - resolved charge currents of opposite spins . </S>"
