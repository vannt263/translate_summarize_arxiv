    "chaotic motion accounts on the one hand for the well - known phenomenon of sensitive dependence on initial conditions , that is , exponentially fast divergence of nearby orbits , and on the other hand for the phenomenon of decay of correlations or mixing .",
    "both properties are intimately related with the observation that even low - dimensional chaotic systems share common features with random processes .",
    "this intuitive picture has been used as a basis to address some of the fundamental questions arising in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is a simple exercise to show that topological mixing implies sensitive dependence on initial conditions . at the measure - theoretical level , however , relating lyapunov exponents , the quantitative measures for sensitive dependence on initial conditions , to decay rates of correlation functions is a more involved task .",
    "for instance , it is easy to construct simple maps with finite lyapunov exponent and arbitrarily small correlation decay ( see , for example , a markov model described in @xcite ) .",
    "thus , at a quantitative level it is tempting to explore in some detail in which way the rate of correlation decay is linked with lyapunov exponents , as both quantities are supposed to have a common origin . in more general terms and from a wider perspective",
    "this topic can be viewed as belonging to the realm of fluctuation dissipation relations for nonequilibrium dynamics , where one cause , the underlying detailed dynamical structure , is responsible for the approach to the stationary state , that is , for the decay of correlations , but , at the same time , is responsible for fluctuation properties at a microscopic level , or in our context for the sensitive dependence of initial conditions and a positive lyapunov exponent .",
    "furthermore , any relation between decay of correlations and lyapunov exponents is of great practical interest , as the measurement of lyapunov exponents , unlike the rate of correlation decay , is notoriously difficult to determine in real world experiments @xcite . in @xcite",
    "it was even suggested to take correlation decay rates as a meaningful approximation for lyapunov exponents .",
    "the problem we want to address can be illustrated by a very basic textbook example , probably considered for the first time more than two decades ago @xcite .",
    "consider a linear full branch map ( see figure [ fig:1 ] ) on the unit interval @xmath0 $ ] , that is , a map @xmath1 having a finite partition of @xmath2 into closed intervals @xmath3 with pairwise disjoint interior such that ( i ) for each @xmath4 , we have @xmath5 , and ( ii ) @xmath6 has constant slope @xmath7 on each @xmath3 .",
    "the physical invariant measure is given by the lebesgue measure and the lyapunov exponent with respect to this measure can be expressed in terms of the slopes @xmath8 with @xmath9 denoting the size of the interval @xmath3 .",
    "the exponential rate of decay for correlation functions is determined by the negative logarithm of the second largest eigenvalue in modulus of the associated perron - frobenius operator . in this setting it",
    "is well known ( see , for example , @xcite ) that eigenfunctions of the perron - frobenius operator are given by polynomials and that the corresponding eigenvalues @xmath10 can be expressed as @xmath11 with largest eigenvalue @xmath12 and the subleading eigenvalue @xmath13 being the second largest in modulus , @xmath14 .",
    "thus , correlation functions of sufficiently smooth observables decay typically at an exponential rate @xmath15 . since @xmath16 we obtain an upper bound for the decay rate @xmath17 which can now be related to the lyapunov exponent .",
    "if we apply jensen s inequality to the convex function @xmath18 we end up with @xmath19 the estimate of the decay rate in has been based on @xmath20 which contains positive terms only , even if the slopes have different signs . as a result",
    "the upper bound is given by twice the lyapunov exponent .",
    "if all slopes have the same sign , say @xmath21 , then @xmath22 determines the subleading eigenvalue and the lyapunov exponent itself yields an upper bound for the decay rate , that is , @xmath23 .    ]    in this article we will address the question to which extent this simple reasoning can be generalised to a larger class of systems . from a mathematical perspective there is a considerable amount of literature on the existence of invariant measures of one - dimensional maps , the corresponding lyapunov exponent , estimates for the spectra of the associated perron - frobenius operator , and a possible relation between lyapunov exponents and the decay of correlation functions @xcite .",
    "expansiveness of the underlying map @xmath24 is to some extent the key ingredient to establish a physical measure @xmath25 , that is , an invariant measure which asymptotically characterises a large set of orbits , or in formal terms an invariant ergodic probability measure which is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesque measure ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "the lyapunov exponent for a lebesque typical point @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 regarding decay rates for correlation functions , a substantial part of the problem consists in giving the notion of the rate of correlation decay a proper meaning ( see , for example , @xcite ) . with the standard definition of a correlation function for two observables @xmath28 and @xmath29 , @xmath30 the exponential decay rate @xmath31 governing the asymptotic behaviour of the correlation function",
    "may be formally introduced by @xmath32 the rate @xmath31 is sensitive to the choice of @xmath28 and @xmath29 and can be made arbitrarily small or large by special choices for the observables @xcite .",
    "however , it is possible to define a rate of decay with respect to `` typical '' observables from some linear space  @xmath33 @xmath34 we will call this quantity the _ mixing rate_. note that this rate still depends , for instance , on the degree of smoothness shared by the observables in @xmath35 .",
    "one approach for determining bounds on the mixing rate @xmath36 relies on reformulating in terms of the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "the rate @xmath36 is then determined by the subleading eigenvalue or by the essential spectral radius of the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "the desired relation between the lyapunov exponent and the mixing rate expressed in then becomes a lower bound for the subleading eigenvalue .",
    "there is a considerable body of literature on upper bounds for spectral values ( see , for example , @xcite ) providing useful tools to establish ergodic properties of dynamical systems .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge hardly any nontrivial lower bounds exist ( see , however , @xcite , where an exponential lower bound for correlation functions of suspension semiflows is given ) .",
    "the main tool to establish the desired inequality consists in studying the properties of the generalised perron - frobenius operator @xmath37 with potential @xmath38 @xmath39 for @xmath40 this expression reduces to the perron - frobenius operator which has leading eigenvalue one .",
    "the subleading eigenvalue @xmath13 ( or the essential spectral radius , if no subleading eigenvalue exists ) determines the mixing rate @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , the derivative of the largest eigenvalue @xmath42 of with respect to @xmath43 , that is , the derivative of the topological pressure , determines the lyapunov exponent ( see , for example , @xcite for a basic exposition ) .",
    "finally , the required estimate follows from the convexity of the topological pressure and gives a lower bound for the subleading eigenvalue of the perron - frobenius operator .",
    "the main challenge is , of course , to put these ideas into practice . restricting to piecewise linear markov maps considerably reduces the need to worry about mathematical subtleties , as the operator @xmath44 admits finite - dimensional matrix representations when considering observables consisting of piecewise analytic functions .",
    "thus , at a computational level all technical details reduce to straightforward matrix manipulations ( see section [ sec:2 ] ) , allowing us to keep the presentation elementary and , at the same time , making the underlying ideas transparent . to keep the presentation self - contained basic properties of piecewise linear markov maps together with properties of @xmath44",
    "are summarised in the appendix . in section [ sec:3 ]",
    "we are addressing the question whether the bounds presented in section [ sec:2 ] hold for general ( non - linear ) expanding markov maps .",
    "we have compelling evidence that the estimate breaks down if analytic observables are considered ( see also @xcite ) , but the validity of our proposition can be restored if observables of bounded variation are considered .",
    "let us consider a topologically mixing piecewise linear expanding markov map @xmath1 with respect to the partition @xmath45 of the interval @xmath2 ( see definition  [ defn : markovmap ] for a formal account ) .",
    "denote by @xmath46 the @xmath4-th branch of @xmath6 .",
    "a nice property of such maps is that the corresponding transfer operators have finite matrix representations .",
    "in fact , the space of piecewise polynomial functions of degree less than @xmath47 , that is , the space of functions of the form @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the characteristic function of the interval @xmath3 , is an @xmath37-invariant subspace . while it appears to be difficult to trace the earliest reference for this result , to the best of our knowledge the first experimentally relevant application appeared in the context of power spectra for intermittent dynamics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "now , in the natural basis of piecewise monomials , the operator @xmath37 restricted to the invariant subspace mentioned above is represented by the @xmath50 block upper triangular matrix    @xmath51    a calculation similar to the one used to obtain the matrix representation @xmath52 of @xmath53 on the space of piecewise constant functions ( see , for example , @xcite ) , shows that the matrix elements of the block matrices @xmath54 are given in terms of the slopes @xmath7 , the intercepts @xmath55 of the branches @xmath56 of the map @xmath6 , and the topological transition matrix @xmath57 induced by @xmath6 and @xmath58 ( see ) as follows : @xmath59 the eigenvalues are determined by the diagonal blocks @xmath60 with matrix elements given by the first factor in .    note",
    "that since the underlying map is assumed to be topologically mixing , the matrices @xmath60 are irreducible and aperiodic for even @xmath61 .",
    "the perron - frobenius theorem ( see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) , now guarantees that @xmath60 has a simple , positive eigenvalue , larger ( in modulus ) than all other eigenvalues , which we denote by @xmath62 .",
    "now , @xmath42 determines the topological pressure , given by @xmath63 , which has the following well - known properties .",
    "[ prop : toppres ]    * @xmath64 ; * @xmath65 is a convex function of @xmath43 ; * @xmath65 is analytic in @xmath43 ; * @xmath66 .",
    "these properties have been established for a rather large class of dynamical systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) . in our context , however , they follow easily from the matrix representation above using elementary methods . as an example",
    ", we shall derive property ( ii ) . to simplify notation",
    ", we shall denote the first block matrix @xmath67 by @xmath68 for the remainder of the argument .",
    "observing that @xmath69 is obtained from @xmath70 as @xmath71 tends to infinity , convexity of the topological pressure , that is , @xmath72 follows from a simple estimate using the hlder inequality @xmath73 here we have used that implies @xmath74 as well as @xmath75 .",
    "the other statements of the lemma can be derived in a similar way , or can be found in standard textbooks on ergodic theory .    to establish a relation between the correlation decay , that is , between the eigenvalues of the operator for @xmath40 , and the lyapunov exponent , note that the largest eigenvalue of the perron - frobenius operator is given by @xmath76 , while @xmath77 is a positive eigenvalue , which provides a lower bound for the subleading eigenvalue of @xmath37 .",
    "thus , on the one hand @xmath78 on the other hand @xmath79 by , which implies @xmath80 hence , using the properties of the topological pressure in lemma  [ prop : toppres ] , the relations and yield @xmath81 see figure [ fig : toppressure ] for a graphical illustration of this result .     and graphical illustration of the estimates ( [ eq : ah_lambda3 ] ) and ( [ eq : ah_lambda2 ] ) .",
    "[ fig : toppressure ] ]    note that if all slopes @xmath7 of @xmath6 have the same sign , then we have @xmath82 .",
    "thus , we can apply the previous arguments to @xmath83 to obtain the following improved estimate @xmath84 to summarise , we have shown the following .",
    "[ thm : main ] let @xmath85 denote a topologically mixing piecewise linear expanding markov map .",

    "the assumption that @xmath6 be topologically mixing is sufficient but not necessary . indeed",
    ", there exist piecewise linear expanding markov maps @xmath6 with the following properties : the map @xmath6 is not topologically mixing , yet exhibits exponential decay of correlations and the conclusions of proposition [ thm : main ] hold .",
    "the simplest examples for which the bounds are achieved are the tent map ( @xmath90 ) and the doubling map ( @xmath91 ) .",
    "it is finally worth mentioning that the condition @xmath92 , that is , the absolute continuity of the reference measure with respect to lebesgue measure , is not essential for proposition  [ thm : main ] to be valid .",
    "the conclusions also hold , for instance , for certain gibbs measures with respect to piecewise constant potentials .",
    "the setup of piecewise linear markov maps is rather special .",
    "one may thus be tempted to ask whether a result like proposition  [ thm : main ] extends , say , to markov maps with finite curvature .",
    "the previous considerations are based on , a result which has been exploited previously in a slightly more restricted setup @xcite to conjecture an exact relation between correlation decay and generalised lyapunov exponents .",
    "it has already been demonstrated that such an identity breaks down for maps with finite curvature @xcite .",
    "this fact , taken on its own , however , does not prevent the validity of a generalisation of proposition  [ thm : main ] , making a study of how curvature affects the previous considerations a worthy task .    using an ulam - like construction any expanding markov map can be approximated by a piecewise linear map ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",

    "then the rate of decay of correlations for functions of bounded variation is bounded by the lyapunov exponent @xmath136    in fact , almost identical statements can be found in @xcite , for example , corollary  9.2 .",
    "there is no simple , straightforward answer to the question about the relation between lyapunov exponents and mixing rates . on formal grounds",
    "one may argue that both quantities probe entirely different and independent aspects of a dynamical system , and that no particular relation should be expected .",
    "lyapunov exponents are determined by properties related to the largest eigenvalue of the perron - frobenius operator . by contrast",
    ", correlation decay depends crucially on properties of the observables , with mixing rates being related to the subleading part of the spectrum .",
    "thus , abstract operator theory on its own does not seem to provide further insight into the relation between both quantities .",
    "witness , for example , the doubling map viewed as an analytic map on the unit circle . while its lyapunov exponent is finite , the perron - frobenius operator has no nontrivial eigenvalue when considered on the space of analytic functions , that is , correlations of analytic observables decay faster than any exponential ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the argument outlined above , however , is a bit too simplistic .",
    "in fact , our results on piecewise linear expanding markov maps observed via piecewise analytic functions or general piecewise smooth expanding maps observed via functions of bounded variation suggest that bounds on the mixing rate in terms of lyapunov exponents can be derived provided that specific properties of the underlying dynamical system are taken into account",
    ". estimates of this type rely on nontrivial lower bounds for spectra . as such",
    ", they are complementary to estimates which are available for proving the existence of spectral gaps , and will thus require completely different approaches .",
    "it turns out that the spirit of the result contained in proposition [ bvcor ] can be understood by considering an observable with a single discontinuity . in order to substantiate this claim",
    "we have performed numerical simulations on the map for @xmath110 .",
    "we have computed the autocorrelation function for the observable @xmath137 with @xmath138 if @xmath139 and @xmath140 if @xmath141 , having a discontinuity of stepsize @xmath142 at @xmath143 ( see figure [ fig:4 ] ) .",
    "choosing @xmath144 , the corresponding observable @xmath145 is analytic and the correlation decay is seen to follow the subleading eigenvalue @xmath13 of the perron - frobenius operator defined on the space of analytic functions ( see figure [ fig : counterexample](b ) ) . in the discontinuous case corresponding to @xmath146 the short time initial decay of the correlations still follows the pattern of the analytic observable , but the correlation function now develops an exponential tail which obeys .",
    "the tail becomes more pronounced if the stepsize increases .",
    "in fact , the mixing rate seems to be very close to the lyapunov exponent .",
    "revisiting the considerations leading to proposition [ bvcor ] , it is tempting to surmise that this coincidence is a consequence of large deviation properties of finite time lyapunov exponents , since the expression for the essential spectral radius involves an extreme value of a finite time lyapunov exponent . thus , the relation between lyapunov exponents and mixing rates for observables of bounded variation could be viewed to arise from the same mechanism already exploited in @xcite for analysing the simple case mentioned in the introduction .     with different stepsizes @xmath142 for the map @xmath100 with @xmath110 .",
    "the straight lines represent an exponential decay with rate @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "ergodic averages have been computed as time averages of a series of length @xmath149 for @xmath150 uniformly distributed initial conditions , skipping a transient of length @xmath151 .",
    "the horizontal dotted line indicates the order of magnitude of statistical errors induced by the finite ensemble size.[fig:4 ] ]    this simple demonstration gives support to the folklore that correlation decay is linked with lyapunov exponents .",
    "even if a real world phenomenon is sufficiently well - modelled by a smooth dynamical system for which to date no link between correlation decay and lyapunov exponents can be established , one should keep in mind that modern data processing inevitably involves digital devices , which correspond to discontinuous observations .",
    "therefore , in formal terms observables of bounded variation could be the relevant class for applications and in these cases proposition [ bvcor ] applies .    at an intuitive level it is easy to understand why discontinuous observations result in correlation decay related to lyapunov exponents .",
    "a discontinuous observable is able to distinguish between different `` microstates '' at a `` macroscopic '' level , that is , a discontinuous observation is able to distinguish two states at infinitesimal distance .",
    "as the distance between two nearby phase space points separated by a discontinuity grows according to the lyapunov exponent , the sensitivity at the microscale may be transported to the macroscale , that is , it may filter through to the correlation function by a discontinuous observation .    in our context",
    "the mathematical challenge is to establish a relation between mixing rates and lyapunov exponents for natural classes of observables , for example , full branch analytic interval maps observed via analytic functions . besides the need for developing tools to obtain lower bounds for spectra , establishing the relation alluded to above also requires a deeper understanding of which dynamical feature causes the point spectrum of the perron - frobenius operator , that is , which signature of the microscopic dynamics survives if viewed via analytic observables .",
    "this is reminiscent of coarse - graining approaches in statistical mechanics , for example , the introduction of collective coordinates and quasi - particles .",

    "then , for any real @xmath43 , the transfer operator @xmath185 is a well defined bounded operator from @xmath183 into itself and is given by @xmath186    the representation ( [ app : eq1 ] ) follows from a short calculation using the definition ( [ app : eq : rpfapp ] ) of @xmath185 . since @xmath187 is constant and the disk @xmath179 satisfies ( [ app : eq : adapted ] ) , the operator maps @xmath183 to @xmath183 . in order to see",
    "that @xmath188 is bounded observe that if @xmath189 with @xmath190 , then @xmath191    the space @xmath183 is not the only suitable space of observables .",
    "restricting to one and the same disk of analyticity for each branch , however , simplifies notation .",
    "more general spaces are discussed in @xcite and @xcite .        in order to explain the factorisation of the transfer operator we observe that in ( [ app : eq1 ] ) the argument of @xmath193 , that is @xmath194 , is contained in the smaller disk @xmath178 because of ( [ app : eq : adapted ] )",
    ". we can thus use ( [ app : eq1 ] ) to define the operator on a larger function space , namely @xmath195 .",
    "note that the space is ` larger ' as analyticity is only required on a smaller disk @xmath196 .",
    "we shall write @xmath197 in order to distinguish this lifted operator from the one occurring in proposition  [ app : prop1 ] .",
    "note that the arguments in this proposition can be adapted to show that @xmath198 is a bounded operator .",
    "it is tempting to think of @xmath185 and @xmath198 as being essentially the same , since they are given by the same functional expression .",
    "however , as operators the two are different as the latter is defined on a larger domain . yet , both operators are related by restriction . in order to give a precise formulation of this fact we introduce a bounded embedding operator @xmath199 which maps the smaller space @xmath183 injectively into the larger space @xmath195 . to be precise @xmath200",
    "is given by @xmath201 , where @xmath202 in turn is given by @xmath203 for @xmath204 .",
    "note that @xmath205 looks superficially like the identity .",
    "this , however , is misleading as argument and image are considered in different spaces .",
    "the relation between @xmath185 and @xmath198 can now be written as @xmath206 note that the factorisation above disentangles the intricacies of the map contained in @xmath207 from its general expansiveness contained in @xmath208 .",
    "we now turn to the approximation argument . for piecewise linear markov maps",
    "the transfer operator is easily seen to map piecewise polynomial functions of degree at most @xmath47 into piecewise polynomial functions of degree at most @xmath47 .",
    "this follows from a straightforward calculation using the fact that the inverse branches are affine functions .    in order to exploit this property of the transfer operator",
    "further we shall introduce a projection operator defined as follows : given an analytic function @xmath142 in @xmath209 and an integer @xmath47 we use @xmath210 to denote the truncated taylor series expansion @xmath211 where @xmath212 denotes the centre of the disk @xmath179 . clearly , @xmath213 is a projection operator .",
    "it turns out that the projections @xmath213 approximate the embedding @xmath214 for large @xmath47 in a strong sense . in order to make this statement , the heart of the approximation argument alluded to above , more precise , we observe that , by cauchy s integral theorem , we have for any @xmath215 and any @xmath204 @xmath216 where the contour @xmath217 is the positively oriented boundary of a disk centred at @xmath212 with radius lying strictly between @xmath218 and @xmath219 .",
    "it follows that the norm of @xmath220 viewed as an operator from @xmath209 to @xmath221 satisfies @xmath222 in particular , we have @xmath223 in order to extend this result to the space of piecewise analytic functions @xmath183 we introduce the projection operator @xmath224 by setting @xmath225 .",
    "the analogue of ( [ app : japprox ] ) now reads @xmath226 we are now able to combine the factorisation ( [ app : lfactor ] ) with the approximation result above to prove the main result of this appendix .",
    "[ app : prop2 ] suppose we are given a piecewise linear expanding markov map @xmath6 with inverse branches @xmath184 and disks @xmath227 satisfying ( [ app : eq : adapted ] ) .",
    "then , for any real @xmath43 , the transfer operator @xmath185 viewed as an operator on @xmath183 is compact and its non - zero eigenvalues ( with multiplicities ) are precisely the non - zero eigenvalues of the matrices @xmath60 with @xmath192 given in ( [ melements ] ) .",
    "we start by recalling that for every @xmath228 the transfer operator @xmath185 leaves the space @xmath229 invariant , that is , @xmath230 .",
    "thus @xmath231 where @xmath232 denotes the identity on @xmath183 .",
    "using the above equation and the factorisation ( [ app : lfactor ] ) we see that @xmath233 which , using ( [ app : jcalapprox ] ) , implies @xmath234 since @xmath235 is a finite - rank operator for every @xmath47 , the limit above implies that @xmath185 is compact . clearly , the non - zero eigenvalues of each @xmath235 are exactly the non - zero eigenvalues of the block matrices ( [ blockmatrix ] ) . the remaining assertion , namely that the non - zero spectrum of the transfer operator is captured by the non - zero spectra of the finite dimensional matrix representations follows from ( [ app : lapprox ] ) together with an abstract spectral approximation result ( see ( * ? ? ? * xi.9.5 ) ) .",
    "[ app : cor ] suppose that the hypotheses of the previous proposition hold .",
    "if the markov map @xmath6 is also topologically mixing , then @xmath236 has a simple positive leading eigenvalue @xmath42 .",
    "moreover , this leading eigenvalue is the perron eigenvalue of the matrix @xmath67 .",
    "this follows from the previous proposition together with the observation that for @xmath237 the spectral radius @xmath238 of the matrix @xmath60 is strictly smaller than the perron eigenvalue of @xmath67 . in order to see this note that for all @xmath237 we have @xmath239 where @xmath240 a short calculation shows that for each @xmath241 and each @xmath237 we have @xmath242 where @xmath243 denotes the frobenius norm .",
