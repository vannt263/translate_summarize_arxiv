    "it is the purpose of this paper to extend the results of yetter @xcite , generalizing classical results of gerstenhaber @xcite and gerstenhaber and schack @xcite on the infinitesimal deformation theory of associative algebras and poset - indexed diagrams of associative algebras to a deformation theory for arbitrary pasting diagrams of @xmath0-linear categories , @xmath0-linear functors , and natural transformations . in particular , in @xcite the standard result that obstructions are cocycles was established only for the simplest parts of pasting diagrams : for pasting diagrams in which no compositions either 1- or 2-dimensional occur . in this paper",
    "we will establish it for deformation complexes of pasting diagrams in general , by first giving a detailed and rigorous exposition of a method developed heuristically by shrestha @xcite , then applying the method to prove that obstructions are all cocycles in a family of pasting diagrams sufficient to imply the result in general .    along the way to proving that obstructions are closed in general , we will have occasion to consider deformations of pasting diagrams in which specified functors or natural transformations are required to be deformed trivially .",
    "although in the present work such conditions will be used only to reduce the problem of showing obstructions are cocycles to simple instances , the ability to handle deformations subject to such restrictions could well be useful in other settings .",
    "we will also make explicit a point overlooked in the statements and proofs of @xcite theorems 8.2 and 8.3 : the cochain maps constructed in those theorems depend on choices of association for 2-dimenensional compositions in the pasting digaram .",
    "however , as we establish here , the cochain maps are independent of those choices , up to algebraic homotopy , and thus , the isomorphism type of the deformation complex for a pasting diagram is well - defined in either the homotopy category or derived category of cochain complexes over @xmath0 .",
    "at the level of the hochschild cochain complexes @xmath1 , the interesting cochain maps are described fully in @xcite .",

    "in @xcite the chain maps of propositions 8.1 , 8.2 and 8.3 were used only to construct the deformation complex of a general pasting diagram .",

    "the proof begins by collecting the maps from the propositions of @xcite with values in the direct summands corresponding to cells of the pasting diagram in which the compositions have been performed , together with identity maps for those cells which remain from the original diagram , and arranging their summands in the correct places of a matrix of maps .",

    "in this section we use the cochain maps of the previous section to give explicit examples of deformation complexes associated to various shapes commutative pasting diagrams . in one example",
    "we see that cochain maps induced by two different associations of the 2-dimensional composition are not actually equal , but only chain homotopic ( or , to put it another way , are not equal in the abelian category of cochain complexes , but _ are _ in the homotopy category of cochain complexes and thus _ a fortiori _ in the derived category ) .    in the examples , we use commutative pasting diagrams because only in that context is the effect of the compositions of 2-arrows evident : if no commutativities are enforced , the iterative cone construction given explicitly in @xcite proposition 4.7 suffices to describe the entire structure of the deformation complex of the pasting diagram , as indeed it does in the case of commutative pasting diagrams in which no compositions occur ( for example , the commutative `` pillow '' consisting of two categories a pair of parallel functors between them , and two copies of the same natural transformation between the functors ) .",
    "only when compositions are involved do the cochain maps of the previous section play a role .    in what follows",

    "observe , that the conclusion of both proposition [ fatpost1comp ] and [ fatpre1comp ] hold regardless of which part of the boundary ( two composable functors or their composition ) is the domain and which is the codomain of each of the triangular faces labeled with identity natural transformations .",
    "we are now in a position to prove the main result : that the deformations of any pasting diagram are classified by deformation complex in which all obstructions to extending a deformation of order @xmath163 to a deformation of order @xmath354 are cocycles . to do this we will replace the diagram with a more complex diagram with simpler parts , whose deformation theory , when some of the 2-cells are required to be deformed trivially , coincides with that of the original pasting diagram .",
    "a pasting diagram is _ finely divided _",
    "if every 2-cell is either a bigon or a triangle labeled with the identity natural transformation , and every 3-cell is of one of the following forms :    * a composition - free pillow with bigonal cross - section ( imposing the equality of two natural transformations between the same pair of functors ) * a diagram of the form in proposition [ trivialthreecell ] or its 2-dual * a `` triangular pillow '' as in example [ triangularpillow ] * a diagram of the form in example [ equalspost1comp ] * a diagram of the form in proposition [ fatpost1comp ] * a diagram of the form in example [ equalspre1comp ] * a diagram of the form in proposition [ fatpre1comp ]    every pasting diagram @xmath3 can be replaced with a finely divided pasting diagram @xmath355 whose underlying cell complex is a subdivision of the underlying cell complex of @xmath3 and whose deformations when all identity natural transformations labeling triangles are deformed trivially are equivalent to deformations of @xmath3 .",
    "begin by subdividing each 2-cell as follows : insert a bigon with 1-cells labeled by the 1-composition of the domain and codomain of the 2-cell and labeled by the same natural transformation as the original 2-cell , making the domain ( resp .",
    "codomain ) of the bigon coincide with that of the original 2-cell if the domain ( resp .",
    "codomain ) consists of a single 1-cell .",
    "label the complementary cell(s ) with identity natural transformations to be deformed trivially .",
    "now each of the complementary cells has a domain ( resp .",
    "codomain ) which is a sequence of 1-cells labeled by functors and a codomain ( resp .",
    "domain ) which is a single 1-cell labeled with their composition .",
    "choose a parenthesization of the composition and subdivide the 2-cell in the usual way corresponding to a parenthesization , labeling the new 1-cells with the appropriate pairwise compositions of labels already present and all 2-cells with identity natural transformation ( to be deformed trivially ) .",
    "now , for each 3-cell which is not already of one of the forms specified in the proposition , choose an order of pasting composition for the domain ( resp .",
    "codomain ) , and use this to create a subdivision of the 3-cell as follows :    iteratively , for each 1-composition of a natural transformation with a functor , insert a diagram of the form in proposition [ fatpost1comp ] or [ fatpre1comp ] as appropriate and for each binary 2-composition , insert a triangular pillow .",
    "when this has been done for both the domain and codomain , there will be bigons labeled with the pasting compostion of the domain and codomain of the original 3-cell .",
    "identify their domains ( resp .",
    "codomains ) .",
    "the 3-cells of the resulting subdivision are now those explicitly inserted in the construction , a composition - free pillow with bigonal cross - section , and , we claim , 3-cells all of the form in proposition [ trivialthreecell ] .",
    "verifying the claim is a matter of keeping track of the triangular faces in such a way as to organize them into the pairs of triangulated disks with appropriate boundaries : note that immediately after the subdivision of 2-cells into a bigon and triangles , the triangulated cell(s ) ( if any  the original 2-cell could have been a bigon ) are of the desired form : they have a domain ( resp .",
    "codomain ) consisting of a composable 1-pasting diagram and codomain ( resp .",
    "domain ) consisting of a single edge labeled with the composition .",
    "call such a triangulated 2-cell a `` nicely triangulated 2-cell '' .",
    "thus the remainder of the construction begins with the original 2-cells decomposed into a family of nicely triangulated 2-cells and family of bigons . throughout the rest of the construction the family of nicely triangulated 2-cells",
    "will be iteratively replaced with families with fewer nicely triangulated 2-cells ( but with more triangles in the newer ones ) .",
    "for addition of a 3-cell of the forms in propositions [ fatpost1comp ] or [ fatpre1comp ] , the triangles will have as two of their edges the single edge labeled with the composition from previously constructed nicely triangulated 2-cells .",
    "for each of the triangles , replace these two nicely triangulated 2-cells with the union of the triangle and the two nicely triangulated 2-cells , noticing that it is nicely triangulated . when the triangular pillows and the bigonal pillow are adjoined , the family of nicely triangulated 2-cells is unchanged .",
    "thus , when the construction ends , the remaining 3-cells in the decomposition must each be bounded by the union of two nicely triangulated 2-cells .",
    "we can now prove the main result ( recalling the dimension conventions of @xcite which leaves the deformation cohomology of a pasting digram in dimension @xmath356 ) :    [ main ] for any pasting diagram @xmath3 of @xmath0-linear categories , @xmath0-linear functors and natural transformations , the deformations of @xmath3 are classified by the @xmath356-cohomology of the @xmath340 , where @xmath70 is the map from the deformation complex @xmath357 given by the same description as in proposition [ trivialthreecell ] , and all obstructions to extension of a degree @xmath163 deformation to a degree @xmath354 deformation are 0-cocycles .    for the classification statement , first observe that the proof of proposition [ uniontopushout ] applies equally well to taking unions of pasting diagrams in which some 2-cells have been specified as deforming trivially ( provided that cells in the intersection are specified as deforming trivially in both pasting diagrams of which the union is being taken ) .",
    "the isomorphisms of propositions [ trivialthreecell ] , [ fatpost1comp ] and [ fatpre1comp ] then combine by universal property of pushouts to give an isomorphism between @xmath155 and @xmath340 in the category of chain complexes .    that all obstructions are cocycles is a condition local to each cell together with its boundary , and all cells of @xmath355 are either deformed trivially , so that the obstruction vanishes by triviality , are of the forms which were shown to have vanishing obstructions in theorem [ singlecomposition ] , or are composition - free and thus have vanishing obstructions by the results of @xcite .",
    "the primary purpose of this paper , to complete the deformation theory for pasting diagrams of @xmath0-linear categories described in @xcite , was accomplished by theorem [ main ] .",
    "its primary importance , however , may lie less in the result than in the techniques used .",
    "it is the authors intent to apply the deformation theory of pasting diagrams to the still - open problem of providing a complete deformation theory for monoidal categories in which all arrow - valued elements are deformed simultaneously , rather than just the structure maps as in @xcite .",
    "this will require using extensions of @xmath358 hinted at above , in which monoidal prolongations are included as additional operations , as the basis of the polygonal method .",
    "it will also avoid the difficulties in @xcite arising from the need to intuit the correct formulas for higher differentials in a multicomplex from the scant data provided by the instances arising in the deformation theory .    likewise , although for the present purpose there is something unsatisfying about our detour though finely divided pasting diagrams with specified trivially - deformed identity cells ",
    "we believe the direct result , that all obstructions in the deformation complex of any pasting diagram as defined in @xcite are cocycles , though it is beyond our present ability to prove  like the polygonal technique , this detour may have other applications .",
    "the difficulty with the direct result was that although 2-categories , and the pieces of them corresponding to direct summands in deformation complexes are inherently `` globular '' , pasting diagrams are `` opetopic '' .",
    "the reduction of the opetopic to trivial ( mostly simplicial ) elements and globular elements might well find application in connecting the zoo of opetopic definitions of weak n - categories with the globular approach of batanin ."
