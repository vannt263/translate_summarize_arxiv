    "unleashing this potential requires the design of quantum information processors that control a large number of qubits . among the interesting qubit candidates are endohedral fullerenes @xmath0 or @xmath1 @xcite whose decoherence times are longer than those of most other candidates .",

    "it appears therefore useful to combine these properties and use the nuclear as well as the electronic spin for quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "this combination can also solve some problems associated with the fact that the electronic spin is not a two - level system , but has @xmath4 .",
    "one of the main obstacles for implementing such fullerene - based quantum computers is the lack , until now , of a single - qubit readout capability feng2 , readout . here",

    "we consider a row of endohedral fullerenes @xmath2n@c@xmath5 or @xmath3p@c@xmath5 enclosed in a single walled carbon nanotube ( swcnt ) .",
    "this system has been called fullerene peapod .",
    "such systems have been studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "one of the attractive features of the swcnt is that it allows transport of mobile electrons @xcite , which could be used to read out the state of the electron spins in the peapod .",

    "the system that we consider consists of a linear chain of endohedral fullerenes confined in a swcnt , as sketched in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "the @xmath3p nuclear spins represent the qubits , while the electronic spins provide ancilla qubits for coupling the nuclear spin qubits to each other . between gate operations , the electron spin state does not contain quantum information and we are free to choose the state most suitable to our purpose . in the following , we will assume that it is in the @xmath6 state .",
    "we label the states of the auxiliary qubits @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "the states of the nuclear spins encoding the qubits are @xmath9 and @xmath10 . the system is placed in a magnetic field oriented along the peapod axis .",

    "the electronic spins of neighboring molecules interact by dipole - dipole couplings . in this scheme ,",
    "we have neglected the c60-swcnt interaction oka , dub , which are far from the resonance frequency of the electron spin under our consideration .",
    "experimentally , the c60-swcnt interaction is not sufficiently large to account for the observed scanning tunneling spectroscopy ( sts ) images @xcite .",
    "as in relevant papers published previously , we only take the nearest - neighbor interactions into account and find for the system hamiltonian @xmath18where the first two terms are the electronic and nuclear zeeman splitting , the third term denotes the hyperfine interaction and the last term represents the secular part of the magnetic dipolar interaction between the nearest - neighbor electronic spins .",
    "the electron spin larmor frequency is @xmath19 , the nuclear spin larmor frequency @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the bohr magneton , @xmath22 is the land g - factor of the electron , @xmath23 is the gyromagnetic ratio of the nucleus , @xmath24 the hyperfine coupling strength , and @xmath25 is the nearest - neighbor dipole - dipole coupling strength . we have omitted the couplings between nuclear spins because they are too small and use frequency units , where @xmath26 .",
    "we have truncated the dipolar coupling operator with respect to the difference of the electron spin larmor frequencies .",
    "the validity of this approximation depends on the magnetic field gradient and on the distance between the qubits . for a nearest - neighbor distance of @xmath27 nm and a magnetic field gradient of @xmath28 t / m ,",
    "the relevant resonance frequencies of the electron spin @xmath29 transitions differ by @xmath30 @xmath31 , while the coupling strength is of the order of 3 @xmath32 . under these conditions ,",

    "since the nuclear spin transitions are the same for qubits in extended chains as for isolated qubits , all the nuclear spin operations remain the same .",
    "we do , however , have to modify the electron spin operations , e.g. the selective inversion of the electron spin discussed in the second line of eq .",
    "( [ e.swapsi ] ) . the single resonance line that has to be inverted in the case of an isolated qubit corresponds now to sixteen lines at seven frequencies .",
    "single - qubit gate operations applied to qubit @xmath43 have to excite all these transitions equally , since they must not depend on the states of the neighboring qubits .",
    "this is a rather challenging task , which can be implemented by multi - frequency excitation @xcite .",
    "the task can be simplified if we assume that our quantum information processor works under ideal conditions : in this case , only the @xmath44 states are occupied , and we can disregard all transitions in which one of the neighboring qubits is in the states @xmath45 .",
    "these transitions are grayed in fig .",
    "[ f.fre ] and in normal typeface in table [ t.freq ] .",
    "this leaves us with 4 transitions at frequencies @xmath46 , as shown in bold in table [ t.freq ] and as black lines in fig .",
    "[ f.fre ] .",
    "we now consider two - qubit operations between neighboring qubits ( @xmath47 , @xmath43 ) in an extended chain of fullerene molecules .",
    "all such operations start with swap@xmath48 operations on the molecules participating in the two - qubit operation .",
    "the central part of our two - qubit gate consists of the cnot@xmath49 gate or the controlled phase flip cpf@xmath50 acting on a nearest - neighbor pair of electron spins .",
    "the gate ends with a second pair of swap@xmath48 operations on the molecules participating in the two - qubit operation .",
    "the net effect of this sequence of operations is that the two nuclear spins have undergone the cnot@xmath50 ( or cpf@xmath50 ) operation , while the electron spins return to their initial state ( which we assume to be the @xmath51 ground state ) .",
    "this assures that the passive electron spins are always in the @xmath51 state , as we assumed in the preceding subsection .",
    "furthermore , it minimizes the effect of decoherence , since this is the thermal equilibrium state at low temperature and therefore not affected by relaxation .",
    "considering now the central part of the two - qubit operation , the cnot@xmath52 gate between the electron spins , inspection of table [ t.freq ] shows that it can be implemented by applying @xmath53 pulses to transitions 1 and 4 : this implements a operation not on qubit @xmath43 conditional on the qubit @xmath47 being in state + 3/2 and unconditional with respect to the state of qubit @xmath54 .",
    "unfortunately , a @xmath53-pulse applied to transition 4 will also invert transition 13 , which is degenerate with transition 4 , and which corresponds to qubit @xmath47 being in state @xmath55 and therefore invalidates the cnot operation .",
    "this difficulty can be eliminated by various approaches , including multifrequency excitation of several transitions .",
    "alternatively , we may take into account that qubit @xmath54 is not active during a cnot@xmath52 operation , i.e. the information is in the nuclear spin , and the state of the electron spin is the state into which it was initialized . here",
    ", we assume that this is the + 3/2 state .",
    "this eliminates the need to invert transition 4 and makes the @xmath53 pulse on transition 1 a perfect cnot@xmath52 operation .    in an extended quantum register",
    ", we also have to consider that the operations on the nuclear spins will affect all nuclei in the quantum register , i.e. also passive qubits , which should not be affected by the specific gate operations .",
    "if we try to make the pulses on the nuclear spins sufficiently weak , so that their effect on the passive qubits is negligible , they will become unacceptably slow : with the parameters as discussed above , the difference in the larmor frequencies of neighboring nuclear spins is only on the order of 10 @xmath56 ( for @xmath3p ) .",
    "it will then be advantageous to use hard pulses that simultaneously affect all nuclear spins . since the only operations applied to the nuclear spins in our scheme are the swap@xmath48 operations of eq .",
    "( [ e.swap ] ) , this turns out not to be a problem : for the passive qubits , where the cnot@xmath57 operations are identity operations , the first version of the swap@xmath48 gate becomes cnot@xmath48 cnot@xmath48 = 1 , while the second version becomes cnot@xmath48 .",
    "since all operations ( one- and two - qubit ) involve pairs of swap@xmath48 gates , even the second version leaves passive qubits invariant .",
    "the proposed system can be initialized into the ground state by relaxation of the electron spins : in a field of @xmath58 t , at a temperature @xmath59k , the equilibrium ground state population is @xmath60 .",
    "this electron spin polarization can be transferred to the nuclear spin qubits by a swap operation .",
    "readout may be accomplished by using mobile electrons on the outside of the peapod .",
    "various schemes have been developed for the detection of single spins @xcite , which can not be applied directly to the spins of electrons in c@xmath5 cages .",
    "nevertheless , this can also be achieved , by coupling the caged spin to external spins and converting the spin degree of freedom to charges , then detecting the charges @xcite .",
    "located in the front ( back ) of the swcnt only allows the down ( up)-polarized electrons to pass .",
    "the bias stops the mobile electron along the swcnt at a place above the caged spin and an esr pulse generates a cnot operation between the mobile and the caged electron spins.,width=3 ]    this can also be achieved in the present system , as shown schematically in fig .",
    "the electrons used for detection are spin - polarized by passing them through a spin filter and guiding them along the swcnt by applying suitable bias fields . at the position of the qubit that is to be read out , the mobile electron is stopped by adjusting the bias field .",
    "the separation between the mobile and the caged electrons is small enough that a sizable magnetic dipole - dipole coupling exists between them .",
    "we may then write the hamiltonian of the two electron spins as @xmath61where @xmath62 is the spin operator of the caged qubit electron ( @xmath4 ) and @xmath63 the spin of the mobile electron ( @xmath64 ) and @xmath65 represents the strength of the coupling between the mobile and the caged spins . for a separation of 0.8 nm , the dipole coupling strength would be of the order of 100 @xmath32 . depending on the state of the caged electron ( @xmath66 ) ,",
    "the transition frequency of the mobile electron is thus shifted from its larmor frequency @xmath67 by @xmath68 .",
    "this can be used for a detection mechanism : if we want to detect the @xmath51 state of the caged electron , we send a stream of electrons along the swcnt , which are spin - polarized in the spin filter a. this spin filter can be made from ferromagnetic materials @xcite , or semiconductor quantum dots eng .",
    "when the electrons are trapped near qubit @xmath43 , we apply a microwave pulse with frequency @xmath69 and a flip angle of @xmath70 .",
    "this operation corresponds to a cnot operation conditional on the caged spin being in the @xmath51 state and thus to a copy operation .",
    "the mobile spin is then transported further down along the swcnt and through spin filter b , which is oriented such that it only allows those electrons to pass whose spin has been flipped .",
    "this procedure can be repeated as often as necessary to get a sufficient signal at the detector .",
    "so far , we have considered only interactions between nearest neighbors . in reality ,",
    "dipolar interactions exist between any pair of spins . in a linear chain ,",
    "the strength @xmath71 of the interaction between qubits @xmath43 and @xmath72 decreases as @xmath73     is the larmor frequency of the central qubit and @xmath74 is the nearest - neighbor coupling strength . ]",
    "figure [ f.chainspec ] illustrates the effect of the non - nearest neighbor couplings .",
    "the uppermost spectrum corresponds to the case of nearest neighbors only , i.e. to the situation discussed in section ii . if we add non - nearest neighbors ( trace b ) ) , each resonance line splits into 7 lines . a third pair of qubits ( trace c ) ) results in a line broadening , since the additional splittings are not resolved in the figure .",
    "this situation can be corrected if we take into account the fact that all electron spins of the passive qubits are in the @xmath75 state , since the quantum information was swaped into the nuclear spin .",
    "this situation is depicted in trace d ) , where all but the nearest neighbor qubits are taken to be in the @xmath76 state . as a result",
    ", we do not obtain a splitting of the resonance line , but a shift by @xmath77 , where @xmath74 is the coupling between nearest neighbors .",
    "universal quantum computation requires two - qubit operations between all qubit pairs .",
    "if the pair is not directly coupled by dipolar interaction , this usually requires a series of swap operations between nearest neighbors .",
    "our present schemes allows us to avoid this overhead by using a mobile electron . as for the readout , we assume that this mobile electron travels in the conduction band of the semiconducting carbon nanotube hosting the fullerenes",
    ". its motion is controlled by external bias electrodes .     and @xmath78 using the spin of the mobile electron as a bus qubit .",
    "the bias voltages localize the electron at the appropriate positions , the esr pulses ( shown as wavy arrows ) induce swap operations between the stationary and the bus qubit .",
    ", width=7 ]    we consider an array of identical @xmath79 placed in a swcnt as shown in fig .",
    "[ f.remote ] .",
    "as described in section [ s.readout ] , it is possible to exchange a quantum state between the stationary qubit and the mobile electron spin .",
    "we may therefore use the mobile electron spin as a bus qubit : if we want to transfer quantum information between the stationary qubits @xmath43 and @xmath72 , we first move the electron to qubit @xmath43 , perform a swap operation , using the appropriate esr pulse sequence .",
    "we then move the mobile electron to position @xmath72 , perform a second swap operation , and back to position @xmath43 for a third swap operation .",
    "this completes the swap@xmath80 operation .",
    "the caged spin is well protected from external perturbations , but decoherence experienced by the mobile electron spin may be faster .",
    "nevertheless , decoherence times of the order of 10 @xmath81s have been reported @xcite , which would make it comparable to the relaxation times of the n@c@xmath5 in the peapods @xcite and be long enough to perform swap operations as well as transport of the mobile electron fast compared to the decoherence time .",
    "the preceding sections presented a design for a scalable quantum computer . for this concept to become reality , a number of engineering challenges have to be overcome . here",
    ", we discuss the design parameters that have to be reached to make such a device useful .      addressing the individual electronic spins",
    "requires that they are distinguishable in frequency space .",
    "this is achieved by applying a magnetic field gradient , which shifts the individual electron spin resonance .",
    "one difficulty with the frequency - space addressing is that we must avoid generating overlap between the hyperfine - split resonances of the individual qubits .",
    "furthermore , we have assumed that we work in the weak - coupling limit , where the frequency differences between adjacent qubits are large compared to the dipole - dipole coupling constant .",
    "while this is not a necessary requirement @xcite , it simplifies the design of quantum gate operations .",

    "if we wish to stay in the week coupling limit , the separation between the larmor frequencies of neighboring electron spins should then be at least 30 @xmath32 .",
    "as shown in figure [ f.sys ] a ) , this allows no more than 3 - 4 molecules in a row before the resonance frequencies of the higher frequency lines of the hyperfine doublet start to overlap with the frequency range of the lower - frequency lines of some other molecules .",
    "as shown in figure f.sys b ) , it is nevertheless possible to add more molecules without generating overlap , provided the frequency separation between the qubits is chosen correctly .",
    "an alternative approach is depicted in figure [ f.sys ] c ) : here , we assume that the difference between the larmor frequencies of adjacent molecules is large compared to the hyperfine splitting , thus avoiding any spectral overlap between neighboring molecules .",
    "this choice of parameters may be most suitable for @xmath2n@c@xmath5 molecules , where the hyperfine splitting is significantly smaller than for @xmath3p@c@xmath5 .",
    "compared to the electron spin resonance frequencies , the nuclear larmor frequencies are smaller by 3 - 4 orders of magnitude . in the field",
    "gradient considered here , this would correspond to frequency differences of the order of only 5 @xmath86 for @xmath2n and 20 @xmath86 for @xmath3p for the parameters used above .",
    "selective addressing of the nuclear spins thus requires that the duration of the selective rf pulses should be at least several 100 @xmath87s , which may be undesirable for fast gate operations .",
    "a good solution could be the use of hard ( short ) rf pulses that excite all nuclear spins .",
    "as described in the previous sections , each swap operation between the electron and nuclear spins includes an even number of @xmath53 pulses acting on the nuclear spins .",
    "for the nuclear spins of the passive qubits , the swap operations result in a nop , as required .",
    "while the quantum architecture discussed here appears attractive and physically feasible , its implementation faces several formidable challenges .",
    "several proposals have been put forward for injecting and moving polarized electrons on swcnt @xcite . turning those into useful devices for",
    "quantum computing will require precise control by electrodes that allow one to move the mobile electrons between the required positions without affecting the quantum mechanical superposition states of their spin degrees of freedom . currently , there are no date available about the relevant decoherence times for the spins of these mobile electrons .",
    "the closest references are from electrons in swcnt - based single - electron devices pea2 . since the relevant decoherence mechanism is not yet fully understood , it is difficult to extrapolate .",
    "depending on the mechanism and parameters , it may be possible to use dynamic decoupling techniques viola , bang to reduce the decoherence .",
    "in the main part of the paper , we have considered exchange of information between different parts of the quantum register by direct dipolar interactions or with the help of a mobile electron spin acting as a bus qubit .",
    "if these approaches prove too difficult to scale to many - qubit quantum registers , it might be worth considering a distributed quantum computer based on many small peapod quantum registers .",
    "they could be connected via the bell - state analyzer discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , which are designed to entangle two electron spins . as shown in @xcite ,",
    "passing the mobile electrons from different c@xmath5@swcnts through the bell - state analyzers could entangle the caged electron spins in different c@xmath88@swcnts , as required for building a quantum network @xcite . to build the bell - state analyzers ,",
    "however , we have to develop beam splitters for the electrons and suitable charge detectors .",
    "although there has been some progress in these aspects @xcite , these devices are not yet available @xcite .",
    "additional challenges are associated with the peapod itself : depending on the system parameters , the distances between the molecules may vary , and the molecules may be arranged in zig - zag form rather than in a straight line @xcite . in natural abundance , the 1% fraction of carbon nuclei that carry a nuclear spin ( @xmath89c ) will contribute to the decoherence in the system .",
    "clearly , this effect can be reduced by using isotopically pure material , as has been demonstrated , e.g. , in diamond @xcite .",
    "clearly , these challenges are difficult but may be overcome eventually .",
    "it will be interesting to watch progress in this area .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a scheme for performing universal quantum computation in a c@xmath5@swcnt ( peapod ) system .",
    "we have discussed how to efficiently implement the quantum logical gate operations required for universal quantum computation .",
    "transfer of information between qubits was considered by direct dipole - dipole couplings or by using a mobile electron spin as a bus qubit .",
    "while our scheme can not be realized with today s technology , it appears possible that the currently existing obstacles can be overcome as nanotechnology makes further progress .",
