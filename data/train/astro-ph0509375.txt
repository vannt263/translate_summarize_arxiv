    "bright elliptical galaxies are old stellar systems which formed the bulk of their stars at high redshift within a short time scale ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , they are not a coeval family of objects as they for example divide into luminous slow rotating pressure supported ellipticals , called boxy , and fast rotating less luminous ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , called disky .",
    "another devision of elliptical galaxies suggests that they can be divided into core and power - law galaxies according to the steepness of their inner surface brightness profile ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , 2-dimensional integral - field spectographs like sauron or oasis , reveal kinematically decoupled cores in many elliptical galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "there are two competing scenarios for the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "one assumes that they are formed at high redshift during a highly efficient starburst followed by passive evolution of the stellar component ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the other assumes the formation of an elliptical galaxy in the merger of two galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper",
    ", we will test the predictions made by the latter model .    since the early proposal of @xcite that early type galaxies form as the result of a binary merger between two spiral galaxies ,",
    "many numerical simulations have been performed and compared to observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the general consensus is that it is possible to generate remnants which agree in their kinematic properties with observed elliptical galaxies .",
    "recent merger simulations use self - consistent cosmological initial condition @xcite , in simulations with only stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in simulations with gas , star formation and feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "usually these simulations neglect the past history of a possible progenitor galaxy , with the simulations starting from idealised initial conditions .",
    "observationally , there is evidence that the initial conditions of merging galaxies cover a wide range , from being dry @xcite to being ultra - luminous ( for a review see * ? ? ?",
    "it is therefore expected that the stars ending up in a spheroid could not all have been formed in the same kind of event , but must have formed in different events which depend on the past history of the merging galaxies . since merger simulations indicate that violent relaxation is not complete and that the stars manage to remember their initial energy and orbital angular momentum @xcite , it is necessary to take into account the past history of a galaxy .",
    "the main task now is to connect these past histories with the properties of merger remnants .",
    "large observational studies that collect data from several thousands of galaxies , like the sloan digital sky survey , reveal that the galaxy population follows remarkable trends : e.g. the surface mass density of galaxies increases with mass until a characteristic mass scale of @xmath0 m@xmath1 at which it becomes constant @xcite .",
    "the constant surface mass density is mainly associated with elliptical galaxies and galaxies having significant bulges .",
    "furthermore , detailed studies of the size distribution of elliptical galaxies reveal that the scatter in sizes of elliptical galaxies of a given mass is log - normal distributed with a scatter which decreases for larger galaxy masses @xcite .",
    "those authors could explain the evolution of the sizes by assuming continued mergers of galaxies which had initially all the same mass but sizes that followed an appropriate distribution .",
    "the origin of this distribution however remains unsolved .",
    "another interesting observed correlation is that the surface mass density of galaxies in different environments only differs at low masses @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we address the question of where stars that end up in spheroids were formed .",
    "the paper is structured as follows : we begin by explaining the model ingredients we use , followed by a section on the past merging history of galaxies .",
    "then we introduce our definition of the two stellar components found in spheroids and discuss how these components evolve in the simulated galaxy population . in section five",
    "we present our conclusions .",
    "the main strategy behind the modelling approach we follow is first to calculate the collapse and merging history of individual dark matter halos , which is governed purely by gravitational interactions , and secondly to calculate the more complex physics of the baryons inside these dark matter halos , including e.g. radiative cooling of the gas , star formation , and feedback from supernovae by simplified prescriptions on top of the dark matter evolution .",
    "each of the dark matter halos will consist of three main components which are distributed among individual galaxies inside them : a stellar , cold , and hot gas component , where the latter is only attributed to _",
    "central _ galaxies , which are the most massive galaxies inside individual halos . in the following sections",
    ", we will describe briefly the recipes used to calculate these different components which are mainly based on recipes presented in e.g. @xcite , @xcite ( hereafter , k99 ) and @xcite ( hereafter , s01 ) , and we refer readers for more details on model implementations to their work and references therein .    throughout this paper",
    "we use the following set of cosmological parameters : @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "we calculate the merging history of dark matter halos according to the prescription presented in @xcite .",
    "this approach has been shown to produce merging histories and progenitor distributions in reasonable agreement with results from n - body simulations of cold dark matter structure formation in a cosmological context @xcite .",
    "the merging history of dark matter halos is reconstructed by breaking each halo up into progenitors above a limiting minimum progenitor mass @xmath12 .",
    "this mass cut needs to be chosen carefully as it ensures that the right galaxy population and merging histories are produced within the model .",
    "progenitor halos with masses below @xmath12 are declared as _ accretion _ events and their histories are not followed further back in time .",
    "progenitors labelled as accretion events should ideally not host any significant galaxies in them and be composed mainly of primordial hot gas at the progenitor halo s virial temperature .",
    "the mass scale at which this is the case can in principle be estimated from the prescriptions of supernova feedback and reionization presented in section [ cool ] .",
    "however , to achieve a good compromise between accuracy and computational time , we instead estimated @xmath12 by running several simulations with different resolutions and chose the resolution for which results in the galaxy mass range of interest are independent of the specific choice of @xmath12 . changing the mass resolution mainly affects our results at low galaxy mass scales as shown in fig.1 , leaving massive galaxies nearly unaffected . throughout this paper",
    "we will use @xmath13 m@xmath1 which produces numerically stable results for galaxies with stellar masses @xmath14 m@xmath1 .     of the merger tree .",
    "[ fig1],width=302 ]      as mentioned above , once the merging history of the dark matter component has been calculated , it is possible to follow the evolution of the baryonic content in these halos forward in time .",
    "we assume each halo consists of three components : hot gas , cold gas and stars , where the latter two components can be distributed among individual galaxies inside a single dark matter halo .",
    "the stellar components of each galaxy are additional divided into bulge and disc , to allow morphological classifications of model galaxies . in the following , we describe how the evolution of each component is calculated .",
    "each branch of the merger tree starts at a progenitor mass of @xmath12 and ends at a redshift of @xmath15 .",
    "initially , each halo is occupied by hot primordial gas which was captured in the potential well of the halo and shock heated to its virial temperature @xmath16 ^ 2 $ ] k , where @xmath17 is the circular velocity of the halo ( * ? ? ?",
    "subsequently this hot gas component is allowed to radiatively cool and settles down into a rotationally supported gas disc at the centre of the halo , which we identify as the central galaxy ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the rate at which hot gas cools down is estimated by calculating the cooling radius inside the halo using the cooling functions provided by @xcite and the prescription in s01 . in the case of a merger between halos we assume that all of the hot gas present in the progenitors gets shock heated to the virial temperature of the remnant halo , and that gas can only cool down onto the new central galaxy which is the central galaxy of the most massive progenitor halo . the central galaxy of the less massive halo will become a satellite galaxy orbiting inside the remnant halo . in this way",
    ", a halo can host multiple satellite galaxies , depending on the merging history of the halo , but will always only host one central galaxy onto which gas can cool .",
    "the cold gas content in satellite galaxies is given by the amount present when they first became satellite galaxies and does not increase , instead it decreases due to ongoing star formation and supernova feedback .    in the simplified picture",
    "adopted above , the amount of gas available to cool down is only limited by the universal baryon fraction @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "however , in the presence of a photoionising background the fraction of baryons captured in halos is reduced ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we use the recipe of @xcite , which is based on a fitting formulae derived from hydrodynamical simulations by @xcite , to estimate the amount of baryons in each halo . for the epoch of reionisation , we assume @xmath19 , which is in agreement with observations of the temperature - polarisation correlation of the cosmic microwave background by @xcite .",
    "once cooled gas has settled down in a disc , we allow for fragmentation and subsequent star formation according to a parameterised global schmidt - kennicutt law @xcite of the form @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is a free parameter describing the efficiency of the conversion of cold gas into stars , and @xmath22 is assumed to be the dynamical time of the galaxy and is approximated to be 0.1 times the dynamical time of the dark matter halo ( k99 ) . as in k99 we allow star formation only in halos of @xmath23 km / s to avoid too bright central galaxies in clusters .",
    "feedback from supernovae plays an important role in regulating star formation in small mass halos and in preventing too massive satellite galaxies from forming .",
    "we implement feedback based on the prescription presented in k99 with @xmath24 here we introduce a second free parameter @xmath25 which represents our lack of knowledge on the efficiency with which the energy from supernovae is going to reheat the cold gas .",
    "the expected number of supernovae per solar mass of stars formed is given by @xmath26 , taken as the value for the scalo initial mass function @xcite , and @xmath27 erg is the energy output from each supernova .",
    "we take @xmath17 as the circular velocity of the halo in which the galaxy was last present as a central galaxy .",
    "we allow for mergers between galaxies residing in a single halo .",
    "as mentioned earlier , each halo is occupied by one central galaxy and a number of satellite galaxies depending on the past merging history of the halo .",
    "whenever two halos merge , the galaxies inside them are going to merge on a time - scale which we calculate by estimating the time it would take the satellite to reach the centre of the halo under the effects of dynamical friction .",
    "satellites are assumed to merge only with central galaxies and we set up their orbits in the halo according to the prescription of k99 , modified to use the coulomb logarithm approximation of s01 .",
    "if the mass ratio between the two merging galaxies is @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) we declare the event as a _",
    "major _ merger and the remnant will be an elliptical galaxy and the stellar components and the gas will be treated according to the prescriptions below . in the case of",
    "_ minor _ merger @xmath30 the cold gas in the disc of the smaller progenitor is assumed to settle down in the gas disc of the remnant and its stars contribute to the bulge component of the remnant ( e.g. k99 ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that major mergers will lead to the formation of elliptical galaxies .",
    "indeed detailed numerical simulations in the last decade seem to support this hypothesis , and we will assume in the following that major mergers disrupt the discs in progenitor galaxies , as seen in various numerical simulations , and relax to a spheroidal distribution . during the merger , any cold gas in the discs of the progenitor galaxies",
    "is assumed to be funnelled into the centre of the remnant where it ignites a starburst which transforms all of the cold gas into stars contributing to the spheroidal component ( e.g. k99 ; s01 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the second assumption is certainly a simplification of what might happen since we neglect the possibility that not all of the cold gas is funnelled to the centre but some fraction of it can e.g. settle down into an extended disk which continues growing inside - out by fresh supply of gas from tidal tails ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the results of @xcite indicate that @xmath31 of the initial gas in the disc could end up in the central region of the remnant and be consumed in a starburst .",
    "the exact amount is somewhat dependent on the merger geometry and on the mass ratio of the merger .",
    "unfortunately , a large survey investigating the gas inflow to the centres of merger remnants is not available to date so that we use the simplified approach of assuming that all cold gas gets used up in the central starburst .",
    "this prescription for the fate of the cold gas results in an overestimate of the spheroid masses and an underestimate of the secondary disc components in our model .",
    "this is not very significant for massive ellipticals since they are mainly formed in relatively weak dissipative mergers @xcite .",

    "however , @xcite estimate that a cold gas mass fraction of less than 1% accreted onto the black hole is sufficient to recover the @xmath32 relation and we therefore neglect this effect on the amount of gas available for the central starburst .",
    "a larger effect on our results arises from the fact that we neglect feedback from the central source into the surrounding intergalactic medium . as a consequence",

    "it is worth noting that even spheroids in galaxies as small as @xmath52 m@xmath1 have on average only @xmath53 of their stars being formed in past merger - triggered central starbursts , indicating that the main mode of star formation is taking place in discs .",

    "[ fig4],width=302 ]      the distribution found for the galaxy population at @xmath57 is likely to be dependent on redshift .",

    "in this paper we have investigated the origin of stars ending up in bulges and elliptical galaxies for systematic trends with mass , redshift and time of the last major merger .",
    "we divide stars in spheroids into two categories , merger and quiescent , according to their formation mode .",
    "the merger component is associated with major mergers in which cold gas in progenitor discs is driven to the centre of the remnant and a central starburst is ignited .",
    "our simulations predict that the fraction of the merger component in spheroids is an increasing function of formation redshift and a decreasing function of spheroid mass .",
    "the latter is due to the longer time that progenitors of massive galaxies have to grow discs , and an enhanced number of minor mergers , which generally decreases the fraction .",
    "the higher fraction at earlier formation times is a result of the short cooling time scales for gas and the insufficient build up of stellar discs before the final major merger .",
    "our simulations predict that the average merger component in the local galaxy population can be as high as @xmath3 of the bulge mass in galaxies with @xmath55 m@xmath1 and as low as @xmath2 in galaxies with @xmath73 m@xmath1 .",
    "the quiescent component is associated with stars previously formed in gaseous discs according to the schmidt - kennicutt law and later being added to the spheroid during major mergers .",
    "we find that the fraction of quiescent stars dominates bulges and elliptical galaxies . for galaxies above the critical mass scale ,",
    "the fraction of quiescent stars becomes constant at a value of @xmath74 , the result of mergers , minor as well as major , only introducing small deviations as soon as galaxies are more massive than @xmath5 .",
    "the fraction of stars in bulges and discs shows a remarkable relation with the galaxy mass scale . at galaxy masses below @xmath5",
    ", we find only a weak redshift dependency and a decreasing fraction of stars in bulges with decreasing mass .",
    "however , at masses above @xmath5 we find a strong redshift dependence . at higher redshifts ,",
    "the fraction of stars in bulges becomes larger in massive galaxies .",
    "this means that the most massive galaxies around at each redshift are likely to be elliptical galaxies and that only at later times do massive spiral galaxies start occurring .",
    "furthermore , our simulations indicate that mergers leading to remnants with mass larger than @xmath5 always include progenitors with bulges and that more than @xmath75 of the mass in progenitors of mass @xmath76 is in bulges .",
    "this has an important influence on the role of agn - feedback as these bulges will harbour super - massive black holes .",
    "looking at the environmental dependence , we find that only galaxies less massive than @xmath5 show differences . this is mainly related to the different epoch at which these galaxies assembled .",
    "assembly is faster in high density environments resulting in larger merger components in bulges .",
    "galaxies above @xmath5 do not show any significant environmental dependency because of continued merger activity in contrast to smaller galaxies .",
    "recently @xcite suggested that mergers between extremely gas - rich discs could lead to the formation of a disc galaxy during a major merger .",
    "the authors argued that these kind of mergers are likely to occur at high redshifts .",
    "however , our simulations indicate that the maximum gas fraction is at @xmath77 in mergers at high redshift and most likely between @xmath78 for a wide range of masses and redshifts . in general",
    "the gas fraction in mergers is a decreasing function of mass . at very large masses and at high redshifts a small population of gas rich massive mergers occurs , which tends to slightly deviate from this trend .",
    "a reason for these events in our simulation could be associated with missing feedback from agns .",
    "those massive gas - rich mergers at high redshift are likely to have progenitors with black holes .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that in general the merger component is more centrally concentrated than the quiescent component .",
    "the effective radius of the merger component in their simulation is @xmath79 times smaller than that of the quiescent component .",
    "this suggest an interesting behaviour for the sizes of two galaxies of the same mass but different merger component .",
    "the remnant from the merger including less gas and hence less merger component will have a larger sizes . as we have shown above remnants at higher redshifts have larger merger fractions .",
    "this and the observational indication that disc galaxies at higher redshifts are smaller ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ) might be able to account for the observed size - evolution of elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
