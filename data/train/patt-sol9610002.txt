    "it is instructive to see how the @xmath93 solutions @xmath122 of the eigenvalue problem ( [ linpr ] ) evolve upon switching on the through - flow .",

    "the nonlinear solution of stationary convection in the absence of through - flow , @xmath93 , is already disconnected from the conductive state since the stationary bifurcation threshold @xmath181 has moved already at @xmath182 to infinity @xcite . however , at @xmath183 there is for @xmath93 an oscillatory threshold into symmetry degenerated left and right  or in our language upstream and downstream  propagating traveling waves with critical wave numbers @xmath184 and critical hopf frequency @xmath185 .    in fig .",

    "[ iv.c.5 ] we have limited our investigation of @xmath409 and @xmath410 as functions of @xmath2 to cases , where the wave number gap in the @xmath264 marginal stability curves has not yet appeared . therefore , within the gle approximation @xmath411 and @xmath397 are determined by the expansion coefficients of @xmath63 ( [ coeff ] ) at the critical rayleigh number @xmath351 only as long as the calculation of @xmath409 and @xmath410 was numerically possible .",
    "nevertheless , for higher @xmath2 critical rayleigh numbers still exist to the left and right hand side of the wave number gap ( cf .",
    "fig.[om ] ) .",
    "we also found that the @xmath170 saddle point of the full field equations ( evaluated by succesively increasing @xmath2 ) evolves monotonously when @xmath2 increases beyond the threshold where the wave number gap occurs .",

    "the gle results for @xmath411 are increasing stronger than those of the full field equations ( downwards pointing triangles ) .",
    "for @xmath215 the @xmath411 stability limit seems to terminate close to the reynolds number where the wave number gap ( cf .",
    "[ iv.c.5 ] ) opens up in the @xmath264 marginal stability curves .",
    "there @xmath413 seems to change sign when increasing @xmath2 further .",
    "a graphical analysis of this saddle that has moved into the lower complex @xmath354-plane suggests that there @xmath414 above a certain @xmath2-limit for all @xmath167 so that this saddle can be ignored .",
    "we have investigated the influence of an externally imposed horizontal shear flow on linear convective structure formation in binary fluid layers heated from below . to that end",
    "we have solved the linearized field equations for convective perturbations of the basic conductive state numerically with a shooting method .",
    "in addition we have checked our results  in particular some of the peculiar changes wih @xmath2  by a variational calculation that gave a good agreement .",
    "we have determined for positive and negative soret coupling @xmath0 the @xmath2-dependence of the critical bifurcation properties : stability thresholds , wave numbers , frequencies , and eigenfunctions for three different types of perturbations .",
    "the latter are identified by different characteristic exponents that cause perturbations to be stationary ( @xmath170 ) , downstream traveling ( @xmath37 ) , or upstream traveling ( @xmath171 ) at @xmath93 .",
    "the hopf symmetry degeneracy of @xmath171 and @xmath37 perturbations at @xmath93 and @xmath278 is broken by a finite through - flow  wave numbers @xmath191 and @xmath192 , frequencies @xmath198 and @xmath178 , and bifurcation thresholds @xmath188 and @xmath187 develop differences . at small @xmath2 upstream traveling wave convection grows first upon increasing the heating since @xmath188 is depressed and @xmath187 is shifted upwards .",
    "but then , with increasing through - flow the bifurcation lines @xmath188 and @xmath187 intersect giving rise to bistable bifurcation behavior",
    ". eventually @xmath188 flattens out and approaches for large @xmath2 the pure fluid s stability boundary @xmath214  a sufficiently strong shear flow eliminates the soret induced coupling effects between the convective concentration field and temperature and velocity fields .",
    "this also holds for mixtures with positive @xmath0",
    ". the bifurcation thresholds @xmath187 monotonously curve upwards when increasing @xmath2 and collide with the @xmath415 threshold lines that for @xmath278 sharply drop downwards with growing @xmath2 .",
    "this behavior is easily understood by analyzing the @xmath2-variation of the paths of the relevant three eigenvalues in the complex @xmath416 plane and of the variation of @xmath417 .    at @xmath281",
    "the stationary threshold @xmath181 rapidly approaches the @xmath161 asymptote of a pure fluid from below  again the shear flow suppresses the vertical convective transport of soret induced concentration gradients .",
    "thus , any soret effect s influence on the bifurcation thresholds is eliminated by sufficiently large through - flow .",
    "finally we have evaluated the borders @xmath391 , @xmath392 , and @xmath390 between convective and absolute instability for @xmath418 , and @xmath170 perturbations , respectively . to that end",
    "we have determined the relevant saddles of the dispersion relations @xmath419 , @xmath420 , and @xmath421 in the complex wave number plane .",
    "these numerically exact results were compared with gle approximations which agree reasonably well with the former .",
    "the latter were obtained by an expansion around the respective critical values and by evaluating all the coefficients that enter into the linear gle for @xmath418 , and @xmath170 patterns .",
    "support by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft is gratefully acknowledged .",
    "here we describe our version of the shooting algorithm modified such as to better cope with the numerical problems caused by the concentration boundary layers near the horizontal plates .",

    "the eigenfunctions @xmath425 fulfill the boundary conditions @xmath426 following from ( [ randbed ] ) .",
    "first ( [ a1 ] ) is integrated with a fourth - order runge - kutta method with the initial vectors @xmath427 where @xmath428 is the unit vector in @xmath169-direction .",
    "then an arbitrary linear combination @xmath429 fulfills the boundary conditions at @xmath430 , but not at @xmath431 .",
    "the latter is guaranteed by choosing the correct coefficients @xmath432 .",
    "this leads to a set of homogeneous equations @xmath433 the nontrivial solution of ( [ a7 ] ) requires the determinant of the coefficients to vanish .",
    "thus , this solvability condition but also the explicit evaluation of the eigenvalues requires the knowledge of the eigenfunctions at @xmath431 .",

    ", we can expand the stability curve @xmath435 around @xmath436 @xmath437 and we find the defect @xmath438 with @xmath439 the accuracy @xmath440 strongly affects the accuracy of the critical wave number and of the coefficients entering the gle",
    ".    one could change the integrator .",
    "but the problem can be solved more easily . using the mirror symmetry of the eigenfunctions ( @xmath441 )",
    "one only needs to shoot from @xmath430 to mid height @xmath301 .",
    "there the new boundary conditions are @xmath442 the new homogeneous equations replacing ( [ a7 ] ) are then @xmath443 now , shooting only from @xmath430 to @xmath301 we can compute the eigenvalues with a fixed accuracy in our parameter range .",
    "a welcome secondary effect is that one saves cpu - time .",
    "however , it must be said that this trick only delays the boundary - layer - problem without eliminating it completely : if the parameters are such that the phase velocity @xmath444 reaches about @xmath445 the boundary - layer at @xmath430 has become so thin , that it is no more possible to use our integrator .",
    "the borderline @xmath359 between convective and absolute instability is defined by the conditions ( [ ca1],[ca2 ] ) on the dispersion relation after a continuation into the complex wave number plane , which also gives the saddle point position @xmath10 and the frequency @xmath446 .",

    "mainly two problems occur : one needs a good initial guess to ensure convergence of the newton - raphson method , and for higher reynolds numbers , which are not discussed here , the shooting method starts to fail for the given accuracy limit ( see appendix  [ appa.1 ] ) .",
