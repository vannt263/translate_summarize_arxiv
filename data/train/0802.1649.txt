    "on october 6 , 2004 the high energy transient explorer  2 ( hete-2 ) detected a gamma - ray burst ( grb ) with soft x - ray emission before the onset of the main event .",
    "such soft emission , a precursor , is predicted in some of theoretical models .",
    "the fireball undergoes a transition from an optically thick phase to an optically thin phase , and thermal radiation ( the fireball precursor ) may occur during this transition ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . a precursor ( progenitor precursor )",
    "may also be emitted by the interaction of the jet with the progenitor star ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the external shock by the first relativistic shell can also produce the non - thermal precursor ( @xcite ) .",
    "soft precursors are occasionally detected in long grbs .",
    "the first detection was made by the ginga satellite ( grb 900126 ; @xcite ) . in more recent observations , the bepposax ( e.g. grb  011121 ; @xcite ) , hete2 ( e.g. grb  030329 ; @xcite ) and swift ( e.g grb  050820a ; @xcite , grb  060124 ; @xcite , grb  061121 ; @xcite ) satellites have also detected precursors .",
    "@xcite studied bright long batse grb light curves and found that in 20% of the cases there is evidence for soft emission before the main event .",
    "the precursor is usually detected as a single pulse that is well separated in time from the main event , typically several seconds to hundreds of seconds .",
    "the precursor of grb  041006 is not well separated from the main event and is likely to be continuously active during the whole prompt grb phase .",
    "such a long lasting soft component was also observed in grb  030329 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite found that for some of the grbs detected by the bepposax , there is a slowly varying soft component underlying the highly variable main event .",
    "@xcite analyzed the light curves obtained by batse , konus , and bepposax , and found that the width of the auto - correlation function shows a remarkable bimodal distribution in the rest - frame of the source .",
    "this result suggests that there exists a slowly varying soft component in some grbs .",
    "the relation between the underlying soft x - ray component , the x - ray precursor , and the main event is still open to question .    in this paper , we present the results of multiple component analysis of the time resolved spectra of grb  041006 . throughout this paper",
    "the peak energies are in the observer s frame , and quoted errors are at 90% c.l . , unless specified otherwise .",
    "grb  041006 was detected with the hete fregate ( @xcite ) and the wxm ( @xcite ) instruments at 12:18:08 ut on 06 october 2004 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the wxm flight software localized the burst in real time , resulting in a gcn notice 42 seconds after the burst trigger .",
    "the prompt error region was a circle of 14 arcminute radius ( 90% confidence ) centered at , ( j2000 ) .",
    "ground analyses of the burst data allowed the error region to be refined to a circle of 5.0 arcminute radius ( 90% confidence ) centered at , ( j2000 ) .",
    "1.4 hours after the trigger , the optical afterglow was found by @xcite , and the redshift was first reported by @xcite and later confirmed by @xcite to be @xmath5 .",
    "follow - up observations were made at various observation sites ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "vla observations were made but no radio sources were detected ( @xcite ) .",
    "the x - ray afterglow was found by @xcite , and it exhibited a power law decay with a slope of @xmath6 .",
    "the x - ray spectrum was characterized by an absorbed power law model with a photon index of @xmath7 and n@xmath8 @xmath9 @xmath10 .",
    "the emergence of a supernova component was reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the field of grb 041006 was imaged by @xcite using the wfc of the acs on - board hst , and they found a sn 1998bw - like supernova dimmed by @xmath10.3 magnitudes .",
    "the data obtained by the wxm and fregate instruments were reduced and calibrated in the standard manner .",
    "we used wxm tag data and fregate ph data .",
    "figure  [ fig : lightcurves ] shows the light curves of grb  041006 in four energy bands with 0.5  sec time resolution . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are measured for each energy band , and they are shown in table  [ tbl : t50and90 ] . the burst can be divided into four major intervals according to spectral features , and each major interval is divided into a few sub - intervals for time - resolved spectral analysis .",
    "the time intervals for each sub - interval are shown in table  [ tbl : timeregion ] . in interval  1 soft emission showing no prominent activity above 40  kev occurs , then harder emissions follow in intervals  2 and 3 . in interval  4",
    ", the hard emission almost disappears and only gradually decaying soft emission is present .",
    "we call the emission seen in interval  1 an x - ray precursor .",
    "the precursor shows a structured light curve in the lowest energy band ( 210 kev ) , which indicates that two emissions are occurring successively . in interval  2 ,",
    "two peaks are seen in the higher energy bands ( @xmath13 40  kev ) .",
    "the time history of the hardness ratio also clearly shows the corresponding peaks . in the lowest energy bands ( @xmath14 10  kev ) ,",
    "structured emission is not clearly seen . in interval  3 ,",
    "two harder peaks are seen in the highest energy band ( 80400  kev ) , and this structure is less distinct in the lower energy bands .",
    "the emission in interval  4 , which we call an x - ray tail , shows no prominent structure . from the dissimilarity of the light curves in the four energy bands",
    ", it is inferred that the total emission is composed of several independent emissions which have different characteristic energies . for an example , two components which contribute to the precursor , four components seen as a peak in the energy bands 4080  kev and 80400  kev , and one broad soft component which constitutes the major part of the light curve in the lowest energy band . to investigate this hypothesis , we performed time resolved spectral analysis based on a multiple - component spectrum model .",
    "the joint spectral analysis of wxm and fregate data was performed using xspec v.11.3.1 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the time integrated spectrum of grb  041006 is approximately described by a broken power law function ( figure  [ fig : spect_all ] ) ; the low energy photon index is @xmath15 , the high energy index is @xmath16 , the break energy is @xmath17  kev and the flux at 1  kev is @xmath18  @xmath10s@xmath4  kev@xmath4 , where the quoted errors are one sigma . the @xmath19 is 111.19 for 79 dof , and null hypothesis probability is 0.0099 , so the fit is not very good . from this fitting result",
    ", we obtained @xmath20 ergs @xmath10 , @xmath21 ergs @xmath10 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 denote fluences in the 230  kev and 30400  kev energy ranges and the error is 1 sigma . as the ratio of fluences is log(@xmath24 )",
    "= @xmath25 , the grb can be classified as an x - ray rich grb ( @xcite ) .",
    "the isotropic energy is calculated from : @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the luminosity distance , @xmath28 is the differential photon spectrum , the range of energy intergation is from 1 kev to 10000 kev in the source frame .",
    "we obtained @xmath29 ergs . in figure",
    "[ fig : amati ] , the peak energy in the source frame @xmath30 is plotted against the isotropic energy @xmath31 ( the point labeled `` total '' ) .",
    "the relation for grb  041006 obtained from the one component fit is completely outside the amati relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "looking at the residual plot in the top panel of figure  [ fig : spect_all ] , an additional soft component is apparently seen around 6  kev and a systematic excess is also seen around 50100  kev . thus the total spectrum was fitted by a superposition of multiple basic functions . as basic functions , we considered a broken power law and a black - body .",
    "for the broken power law model , we used the following function to estimate the peak energy flux directly : @xmath32 the parameters @xmath33 and @xmath34 , which are the lower and higher energy photon indices , are restricted to the range of -2.02.0 and 2.55.0 , respectively .",
    "the initial value of the break energy @xmath0 of the ` bknp ` basic function is determined from the local excess of the residual between the single ` bknp ` model and the observed data .",
    "the restriction to the break energy @xmath0 is applied so that the parameter converges around the initial value .",
    "the results of the spectral fit for three three - component models are shown in table  [ tbl : fit_all ] .",
    "for comparison the result of the two - component model and a fit by the band function ( @xcite ) and a broken power law function are also shown in the table .",
    "the fitting parameters for the models ` bbody*2+bknp ` and ` bknp*3 ` are given in table  [ tbl : fit_params_total ] .",
    "akaike s information criterion ( aic ) is calculated for each model .",
    "aic ( @xcite ) is a very widely used criterion to evaluate the goodness of the statistical model from both the goodness of fit and the complexity of the model .",
    "aic is defined by the following equation : @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the number of data points , @xmath37 is the number of free parameters to be estimated , and @xmath19 is the residual sum of squares from the estimated model .",
    "the aic includes a penalty that is an increasing function of the number of estimated parameters ; overfitting is discouraged , and thus this method enables one to find the best model for the data , with minimum of free parameters .",
    "the model with the lower value of aic is the one to be preferred .",
    "the most preferable model is ` bbody*2+bknp ` .",
    "the model name is given by an algebraic expression of the name of a basic model .",
    "the second most preferable model is ` bknp*3 ` .",
    "the aic values for the two models are 6.87 and 8.47 respectively .",
    "the lowest aic does not necessarily select the true model , and the degree of the preference is estimated by the aic difference .",
    "the relation between the degree of the preference and the aic difference ( @xmath38 ) , however , depends on @xmath36 and the models to be compared .",
    "so we evaluate the confidence limit of the aic difference by carrying out a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the monte carlo simulation was performed by using the ` fakeit ` command of xspec , which generated 1000 pha samples based on the spectral model to be tested . for each pha sample",
    ", a spectral fit was performed for both the tested model and the model which gave the lowest aic , and the aic difference was calculated .",
    "the left panel of figure  [ fig : aic_diff ] shows a simulated distribution of the aic difference @xmath39aic@xmath40aic@xmath41 .",
    "the simulation was performed with the model spectrum ` bknp*3 ` ; the model parameters were obtained from the fit to the observed total spectrum . for each simulated pha sample ,",
    "model fit was performed for both the ` bknp*3 ` model and ` bbody*2+bknp ` , which is the most preferred model . from this result",
    "the 90% confidence limit for @xmath42 is estimated as 4.7 , below which 90% of samples are included .",
    "the observed aic difference for the model ` bknp*3 ` is 2.64 , so the model is acceptable at 90% c.l . in the case of the band model ( right hand panel of figure  [ fig : aic_diff ] ) , for 98% of the samples the aic is smaller than the most preferred model ` bbody*2+bknp ` .",
    "the observed aic difference is 13.68 , so the band model is rejected at higher than 98% c.l .",
    "all the three three - component models are acceptable at 90% c.l .",
    "the two - component model is rejected at 90% c.l . as the time averaged spectrum of grb 041006",
    "is well represented by a superposition of the three components , we examined the @xmath43-@xmath31 relation for each one . the @xmath31 calculated for a model ` bknp*3 ` are summarized in table  [ tbl : ep_eiso ] .",
    "the @xmath31 calculated for a model ` bbody*2+bknp ` is also shown in the table for the high energy component .",
    "the result are compared with the other grbs in figure  [ fig : amati ] .",
    "the components with @xmath44  kev ( c ) and @xmath45  20  kev ( b ) are well within the amati relation , and the component @xmath466  kev ( a ) is out of the 90% distribution width of the amati relation .",
    "the log(@xmath24 ) for the three components are @xmath470.3 for the component c , 0.78 for the component b , and 0.76 for the component a ; thus they are classified as xrr , xrf and xrf , respectively .",
    "time resolved spectral analysis was performed for 12 independent time intervals , and also for some intermediate intervals which overlap part of one or two adjacent intervals to trace the spectral evolution more closely .",
    "we applied multi - component models in the spectral fit , where the model spectrum is represented as a superposition of an arbitrary number of basic functions .",
    "the basic functions considered here are black body ( ` bbody ` ) , broken power law ( ` bknp ` ) , and a single power law function ( ` pl ` ) .",
    "the xspec built - in model is used for ` bbody ` and ` pl ` , for which the xspec model names are ` bbodyrad ` and ` powerlaw ` respectively . for the broken power law model , we used equation  [ eq : bknp ] .",
    "the fitting results for various combinations of basic functions are summarized in table  [ tbl : fit_each ] .",
    "the fitting parameters for the lowest aic model are shown in table  [ tbl : fit_params ] .",
    "the model spectra giving the lowest aic at each interval are shown in figures  [ fig : spect_each1 ] and [ fig : spect_each2 ] .",
    "the expected number of components constituting the total spectrum is inferred from the number of local excesses in the residual plot for the ` bknp ` model , and also from the light curves in the four energy bands . as an example , the case of interval  2c is shown in figure  [ fig : spect_2c ] . the spectrum is fitted with a single broken power law function , and @xmath0 is determined as @xmath120  kev .",
    "looking at the residual plot shown in the bottom of the figure , local excesses around 6  kev and 60  kev are seen .",
    "so the spectrum of interval  2c is expected to be constituted from three components which have peak energies of 6 , 20 , and 60  kev . in the case of interval  2b",
    "at least four components are expected from the light curves .",
    "one is the precursor component seen in interval  1 , which is expected to be present in interval  2 if it is extrapolated smoothly .",
    "two components corresponding to the two peaks seen in the 4080  kev energy band and one component corresponding to the broad soft emission in the lowest energy band are also expected to be present .",
    "so up to four components are examined for interval  2b .",
    "the model selection is carried out by examining the aic difference , and the 90% confidence limit of the aic difference is calculated by performing a monte carlo simulation . by this statistical examination , single component models considered here are rejected for most of the intervals .",
    "the single component model is accepted only for intervals  1a , 4a , and 4b .",
    "for the other intervals , the single component model considered here is rejected at 90% c.l . and the multi - component models are preferred . for most of the intervals , the null hypothesis probability is larger than 0.1 . for interval  2b , however , the null hypothesis probability is at most 0.003 .",
    "this is probably because unknown systematic errors are present in the data .",
    "the optical afterglow light curve in the r band can be fitted by a broken power - law model with a break time @xmath48 days ( @xcite ) . taking @xmath49 as a jet break time and assuming a homogeneous density profile around the grb",
    ", the jet opening angle @xmath50 is estimated from the following equation ( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the ambient particle density in @xmath53 , @xmath54 the radiation efficiency , and @xmath55 ( 10@xmath56 erg ) .",
    "assuming @xmath57 and @xmath58 , we obtain a jet opening angle of 3.4@xmath59 .",
    "if the grb is viewed on - axis , the collimation - corrected total energy can be estimated from @xmath60 .",
    "the corrected total energies for the three components are @xmath61 erg for @xmath62  kev , @xmath63 erg for @xmath64  kev , and @xmath65 erg for @xmath66  kev .",
    "these values do not follow the ghirlanda relation ( @xcite ) except for the component with @xmath46 6  kev .",
    "that is , the @xmath43 expected from the ghirlanda relation are 39.4 , 13.0 and 6.2  kev for the components with @xmath67 40  kev , @xmath1 20  kev , and @xmath1 6  kev , respectively .",
    "taking a 5% uncertainty in the ghirlanda relation , the observed @xmath0 for the the components with @xmath67 40  kev and @xmath1 20  kev are incompatible .",
    "we also tested the liang - zhang relation ( @xcite ) .",
    "the isotropic energies @xmath68 calculated by equation  ( 5 ) of @xcite are : 2.54 , 0.132 , 3.28 and 24.1 for components `` total '' , a , b , and c , respectively .",
    "the isotropic energy derived from the fit to a single broken power law function are consistent with the isotropic energy derived from the liang - zhang relation . on the other hand ,",
    "the isotropic energies derived for components b and c are incompatible with those obtained from the relation .",
    "looking at the time evolution of @xmath0 obtained by the time resolved spectral analysis shown in figure  [ fig : epeak ] , we can identify seven components .",
    "each component is interpolated with a solid line , and is given an identifier a , b@xmath69 , b@xmath70 , c@xmath69 , c@xmath70 , c@xmath71 or c@xmath72 . the most preferred spectral model for component",
    "a in interval  1a is the ` bbody ` model .",
    "the calculated emission radius is @xmath73  km , which corresponds to 6 solar radii and is a typical radius for a blue supergiant .",
    "the aic difference for the second - most preferred ` bknp ` model is 3.31 and its 90% confidence limit is 4.9 , so the ` bknp ` is also acceptable .",
    "the aic differences for the power law spectrum with and without absorption ( ` wabs*pl ` and ` pl ` ) are larger than 8.9 , and their 90% confidence limits are less than 0.3 , so these models are rejected at 90% c.l . for interval  1b , the acceptable models are ` bbody*2 ` , ` bbody+bknp ` and ` bknp*2 ` , all of which are two - component models .",
    "none of the single component models considered here is preferable and all are rejected at 90% c.l .",
    "thus it is likely that the emission in interval  1b is composed of two components ( a and b@xmath69 ) .",
    "the spectral type of each component is not uniquely determined from this result ; it is either a black body or a broken power law function . assuming that component b@xmath69 is black body radiation , the calculated emission radius is about one solar radius . in intervals 2a2d , the soft components",
    "a and b@xmath69 are present in all the acceptable models .",
    "the peak energies of the components are almost constant during intervals 1 and 2 , and they decrease slowly , with decay time @xmath74  sec for component a and @xmath75  sec for component b@xmath69 . assuming that the components originate from thermal emission , we can derive the evolution of the radiation radii , and they are shown in figure  [ fig : radius ] with the filled circles for component a and with open circles for component @xmath76 .",
    "the data points for component @xmath76 are shifted by a factor of four .",
    "the data points for intervals  1 and 2 are fitted with a linear function , and we calculate the apparent expansion velocity for component a to be ( @xmath77  km s@xmath4 , which is twice the speed of light . this superluminal motion is observed when the emitter is moving with relativistic velocity toward the observer .",
    "the relation between the apparent expansion velocity @xmath78 and the velocity measured in the source frame @xmath79 is given by : @xmath80 the expansion velocity in the source frame is @xmath81  km s@xmath4 , and the corresponding lorenz factor is 1.6 .",
    "the apparent expansion rate for component b@xmath69 is found to be @xmath82  km s@xmath4 , and the velocity in the source frame is @xmath83  km s@xmath4 , which is half the velocity of component a. this result indicates that the soft component originates from the grb photosphere expanding with a mildly relativistic speed . according to the current models of grb photosphere ( e.g. @xcite ;",
    "@xcite ) , however , it is difficult to interpret a blackbody with essentially the same temperature but an increasing radius , unless the temperature is boosted by the growing lorentz factor of the photosphere .",
    "if the component originates in an internal shock according to the model of @xcite the following relation should be satisfied : @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the luminosity and @xmath86 is the bulk lorentz factor of the shock .",
    "if the spectral shape does not change , the normalization constant @xmath87 of equation  [ eq : bknp ] is proportional to the luminosity . as the @xmath33 and @xmath34 are not well constrained in the multi - component model due to the correlation of the parameters among the components , the luminosity is not well constrained .",
    "we have plotted the @xmath0-@xmath87 relation in figure  [ fig : ep_vs_k ] .",
    "if @xmath86 is constant and the spectral shape does not change during the emission , we expect that @xmath0 will be proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "no clear correlation is found for component a ( filled circle ) . for component @xmath76 ( filled triangle ) the expected correlation",
    "is not found either , and it shows a negative correlation .",
    "the higher energy components of the interval  2 , c@xmath69 and c@xmath70 , which correspond to the two peaks seen in the 4080  kev light curve , are resolved as a broken power law spectrum for which @xmath0 is around 5090  kev .",
    "if we assume that @xmath0 decreases exponentially as seen in many grbs , we can derive the correspondence among the @xmath0 as indicated in figure  [ fig : epeak ] .",
    "the decay constant of the @xmath0 is @xmath120 sec . at interval  3 ,",
    "the first precursor component seen in interval  1a ( component a ) is not well resolved .",
    "component b@xmath70 has a similar @xmath0 to that of component b@xmath69 , but its @xmath0 is somehow systematically higher than the extrapolation of b@xmath69 . assuming that b@xmath70 is thermal emission , its radiation radius is calculated and shown in figure  [ fig : radius ] .",
    "the radiation radius is well below the extrapolation of those for b@xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath87 relation of b@xmath70 is shown in figure  [ fig : ep_vs_k ] , and it does not follow the relation given by equation  [ eq : ep - luminosity ] .",
    "the highly variable spectra whose emission peaks vary from 100  kev to 40  kev are also resolved ( c@xmath71 , c@xmath72 ) , and they correspond to the emissions seen in the light curve of the highest energy band . from figure  [ fig : epeak ] , the @xmath0 of the components decrease exponentially with time with a decay constant of @xmath15  sec .",
    "the @xmath0-@xmath87 relations for components c@xmath69 , c@xmath70 , c@xmath71 and c@xmath72 are also shown in figure  [ fig : ep_vs_k ] .",
    "although there are few data points for each component , the @xmath0-@xmath87 relation is satisfied except for two points .",
    "both the exceptions are at the time intervals corresponding to the rising part of the components c@xmath69 and c@xmath71 . during the rise , due to the curvature effect , the emission from a part of the shock front that is moving toward us dominates .",
    "after that , the emission is averaged over a wider region , so the emission properties may change between the rising part and the following part . in interval",
    "4a , component b@xmath70 is likely to remain and a black body spectrum with @xmath89 = 1  kev or a broken power law spectrum with @xmath0 @xmath1 4  kev is also likely to be present . in interval 4b ,",
    "a power law spectrum with photon index 1.9 is the most preferred model , which is almost the same as the afterglow spectrum observed by chandra .",
    "we have analyzed the time resolved spectra of grb  041006 and successfully resolved the components corresponding to the hard spikes and the soft broad bump observed in the multi - energy band light curves .",
    "the components may be divided into two classes .",
    "one is component a , which has almost constant @xmath0 around 6  kev , and components b@xmath69 and b@xmath70 which have almost constant @xmath0 around 20  kev .",
    "@xmath0 for this class gradually decreases on a timescale , 6070  s. the spectral type is well represented by a broken power law function or a black body radiation function .",
    "assuming that the emission of this component is due to black body radiation , we derived the emission radii . at the beginning of the emission",
    "they are 4@xmath9010@xmath91  km for component a and 7@xmath9010@xmath92  km for components b@xmath69 and b@xmath70 .",
    "the expansion velocity in the source frame is also derived ; it is 0.78  c and 0.4  c for components a and b@xmath69 , respectively .",
    "the emission radius of component b@xmath70 is almost constant .",
    "the @xmath0-luminosity relation is examined for these components and compared with the prediction of the internal shock model .",
    "we used a normalization constant @xmath87 in equation  [ eq : bknp ] instead of deriving the luminosity . according to the internal shock model of  @xcite ,",
    "@xmath0 is proportional to @xmath93 if the bulk lorentz factor of the shock is constant during the emission .",
    "we could not find such a correlation for components a , b@xmath69 and b@xmath70 .",
    "the second class comprises the components whose @xmath0 is larger than the former class and shows a relatively rapid decrease on a timescale of 520 sec .",
    "the spectra are well represented by a broken power law function , and the @xmath0-@xmath87 relation almost follows the relation expected for an internal shock origin , so this could explain their origin .",
    "we could not reach a conclusion about the origin of the soft component observed for grb  041006 .",
    "however , the difference in its time variability with respect to the higher energy component suggests that it originates from different emission sites , such as acceleration by a wider jet , emission from a supernova shock breakout , or emission from the photosphere of the fireball .",
    "we would like to thank the hete-2 team members for their support .",

    "<S> the light curves in four different energy bands display different features ; at higher energy bands several peaks are seen in the light curve , while at lower energy bands a single broader bump dominates . </S>",
    "<S> it is expected that these different features are the result of a mixture of several components each of which has different energetics and variability . to reveal the nature of each component , we analysed the time resolved spectra and they are successfully resolved into several components . </S>",
    "<S> we also found that these components can be classified into two distinct classes ; one is a component which has an exponential decay of @xmath0 with a characteristic timescale shorter than @xmath1  30  sec , and its spectrum is well represented by a broken power law function , which is frequently observed in many prompt grb emissions , so it should have an internal - shock origin . </S>",
    "<S> another is a component whose @xmath0 is almost unchanged with characteristic timescale longer than @xmath1  60  sec , and shows a very soft emission and slower variability . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the soft component is characterized by either a broken power law or a black body spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> this component might originate from a relatively wider and lower velocity jet or a photosphere of the fireball . by assuming that the soft component is a thermal emission , </S>",
