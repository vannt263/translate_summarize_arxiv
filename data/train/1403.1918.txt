    "the quarkonium spectroscopy has represented a unique inspection window on strong interaction for more than thirty years , and keeps on attracting great interests from both theorists and experimentalists up to now .",
    "it is well - known that the constituent quark model ( cqm ) predicts perfectly the spectroscopy of charmonium in the scope below @xmath9 threshold , but still has to rise to the challenge in the region above the threshold @xcite . in this region ,",
    "a plethora of new states confirmed by different experiments are in or beyond the spectroscopy anticipated by the cqm .",
    "on one hand , conventional resonances such as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 , whose quantum numbers can be predicted by cqm , strongly couple to open charm final states and then have broad widths@xcite . on the other hand , many newly observed charmonium - like states with @xmath14 , the y(4260 ) , y(4360 ) , and y(4660 ) , exhibit an exotic nature , which couple to hidden charm final states with large partial widths @xcite .",
    "this suggests that these states may have different structures with respect to their conventional descriptions within the cqm .    by studing the hadronic transition to a lower charmonium state like @xmath15 and a light meson like @xmath6",
    ", we can investigate the properties of those conventional or unconventional states in question .",
    "the cleo collaboration measured the cross section of @xmath0 as @xmath16 pb at @xmath17 gev eight years ago @xcite .",
    "recently , the besiii collaboration has measured the cross section of @xmath0 at @xmath2 gev @xcite .",
    "the result is @xmath18 , which is a large value . and",
    "the belle collaboration has also measured the cross section of the same channel by scanning the center - of - mass energy from @xmath19 to @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "they show us that the cross sections are around @xmath21 and @xmath22 when the center - of - mass energy are near the @xmath11 and @xmath12 peaks respectively .",
    "we can imagine that the resonance effects play an important role in those energy areas .",
    "the pioneering work studying the open charm effects in this process can be found in ref .",
    "therein the cross section of @xmath0 is calculated via virtual d meson loops at @xmath23 from @xmath24 to @xmath25 . and , in those regions , the results are in agreement with the experimental data with suitable choices of input parameters .    in this paper",
    ", we adopt the nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) scheme and calculate the cross section of @xmath0 at @xmath23 from @xmath4 to @xmath20 .",
    "it is known that higher - order corrections to the expansion in the strong coupling constant @xmath26 can solve the discrepancy problem in double charmonium production at the b - factory @xcite . in this paper the cross section of @xmath27 is investigated at order of @xmath1 .",
    "our aim is to understand whether the data can be explained at order @xmath1 .",
    "hereafter , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are treated with the light - cone ( lc ) approach while @xmath15 is treated with nrqcd .",
    "the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mixing effect is also important , as has been widely discussed in , e.g. in refs .",
    "@xcite , and will be taken into account in our considerations .",
    "@xmath6 can be described on either flavor octet - singlet or quark - flavor basis , however for @xmath7 the gluonium content may have a role in the interaction . according to the conservation of parity and charge conjugation , the leading - order in @xmath26 expansion for @xmath28 comes from the diagrams where two gluons transit to @xmath29 . in this case",
    ", the color - singlet fock state of @xmath15 dominates the contribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : after the introduction , the sec .",
    "[ sec - form ] contains the formulae used in our analysis .",
    "therein we introduce the lc distribution amplitude for each component of the @xmath29 meson .",
    "the effective @xmath30 vertex is employed within the lc approach .",
    "our numerical results for the cross section are given in sec .",
    "[ sec - num ] , where the comparison with the besiii and belle data are also presented .",
    "the last section is reserved to conclusions .",
    "in the literature , two schemes exist to describe the @xmath6 and @xmath7 mixing @xcite :    * with respect to the flavor octet and singlet bases , where the basis vectors are @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then the states can be decomposed as @xmath33 * with respect to the quark - flavor ( qf ) bases , where the basis vectors are @xmath34 and @xmath35 , then @xmath36    in what follows , we perform our calculation using the qf bases , and the latest value of the mixing angle measured by the kloe collaboration is @xmath37 @xcite . using the definition in ( [ mixqf ] ) , we can get the corresponding decompositions for @xmath6 and @xmath38 @xmath39    in the above decomposition , we still do not consider the gluonium component , which , however , can be important in @xmath38@xcite .",
    "hence we should take the gluonium component into account in the analysis for @xmath38 . on the other hand , the qcd sum rules",
    "has told us that the gluonium couples to @xmath6 much more weakly than to @xmath38 @xcite . in this case",
    "we will adopt the traditional view and ignore the gluonium component in the @xmath6 meson .",
    "based on this argument , an additional mixing angle @xmath40 is introduced , and the gluonium component is defined as @xmath41 , then the @xmath7 state is reparametrized as @xmath42    next we turn to the lc distribution amplitudes of those components .",
    "the lc distribution amplitude of the @xmath43 or @xmath44 component in @xmath6 can be expanded in gegenbauer polynomials @xcite @xmath45 where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the momentum fractions of the two partons inside the @xmath48 component respectively .",
