    "is it possible to define @xmath43 in the co - moving frame as an integral over the probability distribution of the relative velocity in analogy with the non - relativistic case ?",
    "we will see that the answering them we will solve the 3 raised problems .",

    "we first review the concepts of relativistic relative velocity , mller velocity and their relations with the definition of the invariant reaction rate and cross section . here",

    "after that , in section  [ sec:4 ] we re - analyse the low - velocity expansion of @xmath45 . we find known and new expansions as well as exact relativistic expressions for the coefficients as a function of @xmath31 in some important cases .",
    "the mathematics behind the results of section  [ sec:2 ] and section  [ sec:4 ] is furnished by the relation between the generalized hypergeometric meijer @xmath10 function and the modified bessel functions .",
    "being @xmath10 a special function that is not commonly encountered in particle and astro - particle physics , in appendix  [ appendixa ] we give a brief introduction and show its use in the calculation of the integrals .",
    "a summary of the main results is given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "in special relativity , the relative velocity between two massless particles and between a massless and a massive particle is @xmath41 in any frame , while the relative velocity between two massive particles is always smaller than @xmath41 in any frame .",
    "these requirements are not satisfied nor by @xmath46 nor by @xmath1 .",
    "for example in the center of mass frame of two colliding particles with mass @xmath23 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 , thus , for @xmath49 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 assume non - physical values larger than @xmath41 .",
    "on the other hand , a relative velocity compatible with the principles of special relativity is well known  @xcite and is given by    v_`r`= .",
    "[ vrelrel ]    this expression is symmetric in the two velocities and is valid in any frame .",
    "when one particle ( or both ) is massless , then @xmath50 and also @xmath51 .",
    "considering the example above , in the center of mass frame we have @xmath52 , thus , differently from @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath0 is always smaller or equal to velocity of light . in the non - relativistic limit @xmath0 , as much as @xmath1 , reduces to ( [ vrelnr ] ) .",
    "the expression of @xmath53 in terms of the four - momentum @xmath54 is    v_`r ` = , [ vrel_p1p2 ]    that manifests the lorentz invariance .",
    "although @xmath55 is often called simply thermally averaged cross section , actually the quantity is the thermal average of the interaction ( or annihilation ) rate per unit density .",
    "we thus now reformulate the non - relativistic expression ( [ nr_rate ] ) in a lorentz invariant way using the invariant relative velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the expression of the invariant rate valid in any frame is  @xcite    = n_1 n_2 v_`r ` .",
    "[ lorentz_inv_rate ]    the factor    = = 1-_1 _ 2 [ factor ]    accounts for the lorentz contraction of the volumes of number densities in a generic frame and assures the lorentz invariance of the product @xmath56 . in ( [ factor ] )",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are the lorentz factors @xmath59 associated to the corresponding velocities .    from the definition of the invariant rate it follows the definition of the invariant cross section : @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the squared matrix element summed over final spins and averaged over the initial spins , @xmath62 is the usual lorentz invariant phase space for the final state particles , and @xmath63 is the invariant flux    f = n_1 n_2 v_`r ` .",
    "[ invf ]    if we normalize the one - particle states to @xmath64 , that is the number of particles per unit volume are @xmath64 , the number density is @xmath65 , then the invariant flux ( [ invf ] ) becomes    f=4 ( p_1p_2 ) v_`r ` = 4 , [ f_vrel ]    and the standard formula for the invariant cross section is obtained .",
    "an equivalent formulation is obtained by introducing the mller velocity @xmath1 . in facts , using ( [ vmoller ] ) , ( [ vrelrel ] ) and ( [ vrel_p1p2 ] ) we have        the invariant rate ( [ lorentz_inv_rate ] ) is    = n_1 n_2 |v , [ lorentz_inv_rate_vmoller ]    and the invariant flux , with same normalization of the densities , @xmath66 .    the only reason to introduce the mller velocity is to write the lorentz invariant rate ( [ lorentz_inv_rate ] ) in the form ( [ lorentz_inv_rate_vmoller ] ) that is similar to the non relativistic expression ( [ nr_rate ] ) .",
    "anyway , while in the latter each factor is galileo invariant , relativistically the products @xmath67 and @xmath68 are lorentz invariant .",
    "this redefinition is the reason why the collision term of the relativistic boltzmann equation has the same form as the one in the non - relativistic equation with @xmath2 replaced by @xmath1  @xcite",
    ".    it should be clear from the previous discussion that neither @xmath2 nor @xmath1 are the relative velocity in special relativity , contrary to what is often claimed in literature and textbooks . in textbooks ,",
    "when defining the invariant cross section , the flux is usually defined in a frame where the velocities are collinear , say the lab or cm frame ,    f^=n_1 n_2 |_1 -_2| , [ f_coll ]    in analogy with the non relativistic case @xmath69 , and then it is rewritten in the invariant form using @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "it is the formal equivalence of @xmath2 with the quantity @xmath72 in the definition of the flux that is probably at the origin of the confusion about `` who '' is the relativistic relative velocity and the paradox that the relative velocity can have values larger than the velocity of the light .",
    "actually , although @xmath72 is mathematically equivalent to non - relativistic relative velocity @xmath73 , conceptually the two quantity have nothing to do with each other . in the relativistic framework        from this point of view",
    "the fact that @xmath72 assumes in the center of mass frame values larger than @xmath41 is not a problem because this quantity is not the relative velocity .",
    "for example , consider the scattering of two massless particles as seen in the cm frame .",
    "the relative velocity is @xmath51 , but @xmath74 , thus @xmath75 : the relative velocity is never larger than 1 , @xmath1 can be larger than 1 because is not a physical velocity .",
    "we thus addressed the problem ( 3 ) of the introduction .",
