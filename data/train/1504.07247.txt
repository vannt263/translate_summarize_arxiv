    "according to the unification scheme of active galactic nuclei ( agns , @xcite ) , which is widely accepted in current astrophysics , different viewing angles explain the variety of phenomenological subclasses of agns . for example , the optical spectra of type 1 agns present broad permitted emission lines as well as narrow emission lines exposing their central nuclear region , whereas type 2 agns show only narrow emission lines . according to the simplest agn unification model and its strictest interpretation",
    ", the feasibility of observing broad permitted emission lines depends solely on the angle between the observer s line of sight and the axis of an obscuring medium , often called the `` dust torus '' .    with the aid of mega - scale surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) that provide homogenous photometric and spectroscopic data ,",
    "agns have become one of the most actively studied topics in astrophysics . in particular , studies on _ obscured agns _ showing narrow emission lines have shed light on the connection between the host galaxies and the central agn @xcite .",
    "_ unobscured _ ( type 1 ) agns reveal their bright nuclear light directly , and it has been an important task and subject of interest to decompose the observed light into a central nuclear component and a diffuse galaxy component . for example , the high - spatial - resolution advanced camera for surveys on the _ hubble space telescope _ , has been extensively used for this purpose @xcite in combination with two - dimensional surface brightness fitting techniques @xcite .",
    "the fraction of type 1 agn ( among all agns ) can act as an effective test of any model for agn classifications and can be used to extract and constrain critical information , such as the opening angle and source luminosity , in the assumed framework .",
    "based on a sample of high - luminosity and radio - selected broad - line agns , @xcite found the type 1 agn fraction of 40% and a typical value of the `` half - opening '' angle of about @xmath3 .",
    "the precise value of the type 1 agn fraction has been reported to be substantially lower than this finding , when low - redshift surveys of lower optical luminosity cuts are used instead @xcite .",
    "this difference seems to be sensible , as more recent , multiwavelength studies found a strong , positive luminosity dependence of the type 1 agn fraction @xcite .",
    "agns exhibit characteristic spectral features across the electromagnetic spectrum : e.g. ,  optical emission lines , mid - infrared and hard x - ray luminosity as isotropic quantities tracing the source luminosity , which are naturally employed by many type 1 agn fraction studies .",
    "in particular , @xcite found that the type 1 agn fraction gradually increases with  based on sdss data release 2 @xcite and hard x - ray data in the literature @xcite .",
    "a theoretical framework has been claimed to explain such a luminosity dependency of the type 1 agn fraction .",
    "for example , the receding torus model @xcite imposes a dust sublimation radius of the torus , which is directly affected by the nuclear luminosity .",
    "as the luminous central engine pushes the dust torus away , thereby increasing the torus inner radius , the opening angle must increase if the height of the torus is fixed .",
    "this naturally explains the observed luminosity dependence of the type 1 agn fraction .",
    "a precise determination of the type 1 agn fraction is obviously a key test of a model s validity .",
    "since the agn unified model explains the observability of both types of agn as the consequences of obscuration induced by the geometry and the structure of agn , the frequency of observed type 1 agn indirectly constrains the model .",
    "for instance , higher type 1 agn fraction implies wider opening angle , smaller scale height of the torus , and higher nuclear luminosity .",
    "herein we report on our efforts to discover new type 1 agns from the sdss database to provide such a test .",
    "we describe how we found a substantial number of new type 1 agns and derived a more up - to - date type 1 agn fraction .",
    "the use of the new type 1 agn fraction places a harsh constraint on the model , and if the scheme used herein proves convincing , it appears that an important modification to the model will be necessary .",
    "we release a new catalogue of type 1 agns in the nearby universe by means of this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we describe the selection technique whereby we constructed the new type 1 agn database , and describe a simulation that quantified the detection efficiency of our method .",
    "we demonstrate our conservative scheme for type 1 selection and determine the final type 1 agn sources , taking the simulation into account . in section 3",
    ", we present the new type 1 agn fraction and discuss how contamination caused by star formation activities may affect it .",
    "finally , we discuss our findings and summarize our results in section 4 .",
    "we assume a cosmology with @xmath4 = 0.70 , @xmath5 = 0.30 , and @xmath6 = 0.70 throughout this work .",
    "the presence of unidentified type 1 agns in the nearby universe has been reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite [ a.k.a . the ossy catalogue ] . in particular",
    ", @xcite found that the presence of broad balmer emission lines were responsible for a very poor fit by model to both the emission lines and the stellar continuum during their construction of the ossy catalogue .",
    "the authors used a flux ratio near the  emission line to systematically search for blr agns from the sdss dr7 galaxy database . in this work",
    ", we adopted their basic scheme but developed it further to minimize dubious detections .",
    "the ossy catalogue provides new spectral line strength measurements for the sdss dr7 galaxies at @xmath0 ( n = 664,187 ) . by combining stellar kinematics measurements ( ` ppxf ` ; @xcite ) and spectral line fitting algorithm ( ` gandalf ` ; @xcite ) , the authors released improved stellar absorption and emission - line strengths , stellar velocity dispersion , and quality assessing parameters .",
    "we start our analysis based on the ossy catalogue .",
    "to identify the spectra showing broad  features , we computed a ratio between the mean fluxes at two specific wavelength bands . the first narrow band ( 6,460 @xmath7 6,480  ) is located near  but far enough from it to be free from the  broad emission , mainly to secure the pseudo - continuum for .",

    "we used ` gandalf`(gas and absorption line fitting , @xcite ) to fit the spectrum based on both nebular emissions and stellar absorptions .",
    "our approach for analyzing the sdss spectra can be summarized as a two - step process .",
    "first , we masked nebular emission lines and derived the stellar kinematics by directly matching the observed spectrum with stellar templates by using the ` ppxf `  idl program @xcite .",
    "for the `` stellar '' templates , we used the @xcite stellar population synthesis models and the miles stellar library @xcite .",
    "after measuring the kinematic broadening , we lifted the masking on the nebular emission lines and simultaneously fit stellar continuum and emission lines by using the levenberg - marquardt minimization @xcite .",
    "the standard ` ppxf `  and ` gandalf `  procedures generally work well on normal galaxies , but a more elaborate consideration is necessary for type 1 agns .",
    "for example only for type 1 agns , we adopted a wide masking width of 12,000  for broad balmer lines ( , , , and ) and 1,200  for narrow emission lines , prior to measuring stellar kinematics .",

    "it is also noteworthy that there are discussions regarding the effect of the eddington ratio and luminosity of agn on the presence of blrs .",
