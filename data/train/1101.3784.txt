    "coupled - dimer magnets have become model systems for quantum phase transitions ( qpt).@xcite such dimerized magnets are obtained from placing quantum spins on a regular lattice in @xmath0 spatial dimensions , with two spins per unit cell and strong ( weak ) exchange interactions within ( between ) the unit cells . depending on the ratio of the exchange interactions , the ground state can be either a paramagnet , dominated by singlet pairs in each unit cell , or a state with magnetic long - range order .",
    "experimentally , the qpt between these two phases can often be driven by pressure .",
    "additionally , these systems show another qpt upon applying an external field to the paramagnet , which allows to realize bose - einstein condensation of magnons.@xcite    on the theoretical side , it is commonly assumed that the zero - field qpt is  by virtue of quantum - to - classical mapping  in the same universality class as that of the @xmath1-dimensional classical heisenberg model , often referred to as o(3 ) universality class ( note that the dynamical exponent @xmath2 in that case).@xcite numerical simulations of various microscopic two - dimensional ( 2d ) coupled - dimer heisenberg models have indeed found critical exponents consistent with three - dimensional ( 3d ) o(3 ) universality , in agreement with this prediction.@xcite therefore it came as a surprise when results from accurate quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) simulations of a particular coupled - dimer heisenberg magnet , the so - called staggered - dimer model with spins 1/2 , displayed distinct deviations from standard o(3 ) critical behavior , indicating a different universality class.@xcite in contrast , the often studied columnar dimer model was found to follow o(3 ) universality,@xcite suggesting the existence of two classes of coupled - dimer magnets.@xcite subsequent qmc simulations of the staggered - dimer model,@xcite focusing exclusively on the correlation - length exponent , obtained data consistent with those of ref .  .",
    "however , it was argued that the data for the largest systems could be fitted to standard o(3 ) scaling laws .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a resolution to the puzzle provided by the numerical data .",
    "we show that there are indeed two different classes of coupled - dimer magnets , henceforth called a and b. while class a follows standard o(3 ) universality , the low - energy quantum field theory of class b is characterized by an additional cubic term which describes two - particle decay of critical fluctuations and has no classical analogue .",
    "while similar cubic terms have appeared before in the literature in different contexts,@xcite their effect on the critical behavior has not been discussed to our knowledge .",
    "we also note that the two - particle decay of triplet excitations at _ elevated _ energies has received some attention both experimentally@xcite and theoretically,@xcite but it was commonly assumed that such processes are negligible at lowest energies . here , we derive and analyze the critical two - particle decay term of class b in some detail . while its precise characterization in two space dimensions presents a challenge , our results are consistent with this term being weakly irrelevant in the renormalization - group ( rg ) sense .",
    "this leads us to suggest the following scenario for class - b coupled - dimer magnets like the staggered - dimer model : the asymptotic critical exponents are the ones of the o(3 ) universality class , but anomalously large corrections to scaling arise from the two - particle decay term .",
    "this scenario is consistent with the numerical data reported in refs .  .",
    "in addition , we also present finite - temperature qmc results for the temperature scaling of the quantum critical uniform susceptibility , which lend further support to this scenario .      the qpt between a non - symmetry - breaking paramagnetic and a collinear antiferromagnetic phase in an insulating magnet with su(2 ) symmetry is typically described by a quantum field theory of the @xmath3 type , @xmath4 + \\frac{u_0}{24 } ( \\varphi_\\alpha^2)^2 \\nonumber\\\\ \\label{phi4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in standard notation . here , @xmath5 is a 3-component vector order - parameter field describing magnetic fluctuations near the ordering wavevector @xmath6 , with @xmath7 . for simplicity",

    "the critical behavior of the model is known to be of standard @xmath1-dimensional o(3 ) universality .",
    "we show that the following spatially anisotropic cubic term@xcite @xmath9 with @xmath10 being a particular space direction , appears in the low - energy field theory for 2d coupled - dimer magnets belonging to class b. this term causes two - particle decay of critical fluctuations ; it bears some superficial similarity with berry - phase and winding - number terms , to be discussed below , however , its prefactor @xmath11 is _ not _ quantized and the field @xmath12 is not restricted to unit length .",
    "our detailed analysis suggests that the cubic term @xmath13 in @xmath14 space dimensions is irrelevant in the rg sense , albeit with a small scaling dimension .",
