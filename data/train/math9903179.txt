    "singular algebraic curves , their existence , deformation , families ( from the local and global point of view ) attract continuous attention of algebraic geometers since the last century .",
    "the geometry of equisingular families of algebraic curves on smooth algebraic surfaces has been founded in basic works of plcker , severi , segre , zariski , and has tight links and finds important applications in singularity theory , topology of complex algebraic curves and surfaces , and in real algebraic geometry .    in the present paper",
    "we consider the family of reduced irreducible complex plane curves of degree @xmath2 with @xmath3 isolated singular points of given topological , or analytic types ( further referred to as equisingular families , or esf ) .",
    "the questions about the non - emptiness , smoothness , irreducibility and dimension are basic in the geometry of esf . except for the case of nodal curves ,",
    "no complete answers are known and one can hardly expect them .    our goal , however , is to obtain _ asymptotically proper _ sufficient conditions for esf to have  good \" properties like being non - empty , or smooth , or irreducible .",
    "the conditions should be expressed in the form of bounds to numerical invariants of curves and singularities such that , for the `` good '' properties to hold , the necessary respectively sufficient conditions should be given by inequalities with the same invariants but , maybe , with different absolute constants .",
    "as an example , we mention our sufficient condition for the non - emptiness of @xmath5 with topological singularities @xmath6 @xcite @xmath7 whereas the classically known necessary condition is @xmath8 in the present paper we obtain two qualitatively new bounds : one for the smoothness of @xmath5 and one for the irreducibility .",
    "in particular , we show that the inequality @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a new singularity invariant ( defined in section [ sec : smoothness es ] ) , is sufficient for the smoothness and expected dimension ( also called _",
    "t - property _ ) of @xmath5 .",
    "we expect ( [ i1 ] ) to be asymptotically proper for topological singularities in the following sense :    [ con1 ] there exists an absolute constant such that for any topological singularity @xmath11 there are infinitely many pairs such that is empty or not smooth or has dimension greater than the expected one and @xmath12    we know that the exponent @xmath13 of @xmath2 in the right - hand side of ( [ i1 ] ) can not be raised in any reasonable sufficient criterion for t - property with the left - hand side being the sum of local singularity invariants .",
    "hence , for an asymptotically proper sufficient criterion for t - property the right - hand side is correct . on the other hand , for the left - hand side of such a sufficient criterion",
    "different invariants can be used .",
    "what we conjecture is that the new invariant @xmath10 is the `` correct '' one for an asymptotically proper bound in the case of topological singularities .",
    "the conjecture is known to be true for an infinite series of singularities of types @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) and it holds for ordinary singularities , because here the inequality ( [ i1 ] ) is implied by @xmath16 ( cf .",
    "corollary [ smoothn ord cor ] ) whereas the inequality @xmath17 is necessary for the existence of an irreducible curve with ordinary singularities .",
    "we show that under condition ( [ i1 ] ) ( with singularity invariants , where @xmath18 stands for the tjurina number @xmath19 if @xmath11 is an analytic type and for if @xmath11 is a topological type ) the family is either empty or smooth of the expected dimension ( theorem [ smoothness theorem ] in section [ sec : smoothness ] ) .",
    "in addition , for any curve the inequality ( [ i1 ] ) with analytic invariants @xmath20 is sufficient for the independence of versal deformations of all singular points when varying in the space of plane curves of degree @xmath2 .",
    "this improves the previously known condition ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath21 mainly with respect to the singularity invariants in the left - hand side . for instance , for an ordinary singular point @xmath11 of multiplicity @xmath22 , considered up to topological equivalence , @xmath23 whereas the invariant in the left - hand side of the new condition is ( cf .",
    "( [ i3 ] ) ) .",
    "another new result concerns the irreducibility of esf .",
    "it says that under the conditions and @xmath24 the family @xmath5 is irreducible ( cf .",
    "theorem [ theorem 3 ] in section [ sec : irred ] with a slightly stronger statement ) .",
    "the irreducibility criterion ( [ i2 ] ) improves the bounds known before @xmath25 @xmath26 obtained in @xcite , and @xmath27 where , and for other singularities @xmath11 , obtained in the appendix to @xcite .",
    "we like to point out that the coefficient of @xmath28 in ( [ i5 ] ) and in ( [ i6 ] ) depends on the `` worst '' singularity , hence these sufficient conditions are weakened significantly when adding one complicated singularity . on the other hand",
    ", the new condition ( [ i2 ] ) contains the contributions of the singularities in an additive form , whence it is not so sensitive to adding an extra singularity .",
    "we pay a special attention to the classical case of families of curves with @xmath29 nodes and @xmath30 cusps , for which the criteria ( [ i1 ] ) , ( [ i2 ] ) appear to be @xmath31 ( corollaries [ corollary 3.4 ] , [ nodes and cusps ] ) .",
    "this is stronger than the previously known sufficient conditions for the smoothness of , @xmath32 and for the irreducibility , @xmath33 we note also that for families of cuspidal curves our smoothness criterion is quite close to an _ optimal _ one : the above inequalities provide the smoothness and expected dimension of for , whereas the families of irreducible curves of degree @xmath2 with cusps , constructed in @xcite , are either nonsmooth , or have dimension greater than the expected one .",
    "that is , the coefficient @xmath34 of @xmath28 differs from an optimal one by a factor @xmath35 .    concerning the irreducibility it was proven in @xcite that the variety of cuspidal curves of degree @xmath2 with precisely @xmath36 cusps has at least two components for , showing that the coefficient @xmath37 of @xmath28 in ( [ i2 ] ) differs from an optimal one by a factor .",
    "these examples generalize the classical example of sextic curves having 6 cusps given by zariski @xcite . in proposition [ prop example ]",
    "we modify the construction to obtain curves of degree @xmath2 slightly bigger than @xmath38 having @xmath36 cusps such that the corresponding esf @xmath0 has at least two irreducible components but , different to zariski s example , for each .",
    "we do not know whether @xmath0 is connected .",
    "looking for a sufficient smoothness and irreducibility condition , applicable to families of curves with arbitrary singularities , we use the fact that the smoothness and expected dimension of an equisingular family @xmath0 follow from the @xmath39-vanishing for the ideal sheaves of some zero - dimensional subschemes of the plane ( or another smooth surface ) associated with _ any _ curve ( see @xcite for a detailed general setting ) , and that the irreducibility of @xmath0 follows from the @xmath39-vanishing for the ideal sheaf of certain zero - dimensional schemes associated with a _ generic _ curve ( such an approach was realized , for instance , in @xcite ) .",
    "various @xmath39-vanishing criteria have been used in connection with the problems stated .",
    "the classical idea , applied by severi @xcite , segre , zariski @xcite through the later development @xcite , is to restrict the ideal sheaf to the curve itself . for many cases one obtains better results when replacing @xmath40 by a polar curve @xcite , or a special auxiliary curve @xcite .",
    "a similar idea combined with horace s method can be found in @xcite .",
    "chiantini and sernesi @xcite applied bogomolov s theory of unstable rank two vector bundles on surfaces for the smoothness problem of families of nodal curves , which then was extended to curves with arbitrary singularities @xcite .",
    "it was barkats @xcite who showed how to apply the castelnuovo function and davis theorem @xcite for the computation of @xmath39 in relation to the irreducibility problem .    in the present paper we strongly exploit barkats observation , combining it with other tools .",
    "moreover , we perform our computations in a different way to obtain stronger @xmath39-vanishing theorems ( cf.proposition [ proposition 1 ] and lemma [ lemma 6.3 ] ) . finally , we derive sufficient irreducibility conditions with better asymptotic behavior ( see explanation above ) , which involve both , topological and analytic , singularities .",
    "a similar approach is used for the smoothness problem completing with the result ( [ i1 ] ) .      for the convenience of the reader we present the material in a self - contained form . in section [ sec :",
    "section 1 ] we introduce and set up the theory of zero - dimensional schemes associated to singular points . in sections [ sec : topo ] ( respectively [ sec : anal ] ) we do this for topological ( respectively analytic ) singularities . section [ sec : hilbert ] contains a proof for the existence and irreducibility of the hilbert scheme associated to generalized singularity schemes , or , for clusters ( answering a question of kleiman and piene ) .",
