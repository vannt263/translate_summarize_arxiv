    "potential steepens so that slow roll is violated , and the universe enters the reheating phase . during this phase all particles which are kinematically allowed are produced , either by direct decay or from the thermal bath produced by the inflaton decay .",
    "finally the universe enters the radiation dominated phase at a temperature @xmath5 , which is a function of the inflaton decay rate .",
    "the only certain bound on this reheating temperature comes from big bang nucleosynthesis , and has in several previous studies been found to be around 1 mev @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that even if the reheating temperature after inflation is much higher there can still be subsequent `` reheating '' phases , in the sense that reheating is defined to be a period where the energy density is dominated by an unstable non - relativistic particle species . in standard",
    "reheating this is the inflaton , but in supersymmetric models it could for instance be the gravitino .    in the present paper we update previous calculations of this reheating phenomenon , using data from cosmic microwave background and large scale structure observations .",
    "furthermore we extend the analysis to include the possibility of having a direct decay mode of the heavy particle into light neutrinos .",
    "if the heavy particle is a scalar this decay is normally suppressed by a factor @xmath6 because of the necessary helicity flip .",
    "however , the heavy particle could either be a non - scalar particle , or it could be a pseudo - scalar like the majoron which couples only to neutrinos . even though such models are slightly contrived it is of interest to study whether the temperature bound on reheating is significantly affected by the possibility of direct decay into neutrinos .    in section",
    "ii we discuss the set of boltzmann equations necessary to follow the evolution of all particle species . in section iii present results of the numerical solution of these equation , and in section",
    "iv we compare model predictions with observational data . finally , section v is a review of other astrophysical constraints on heavy , decaying particles , and section vi contains a discussion .",
    "we follow the evolution of all particles by solving the boltzmann equation for each species @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the collision operator describing elastic and inelastic collisions .",
    "neutrinos interact with the electromagnetic plasma via weak interactions .",
    "a comprehensive treatment of this can for instance be found in ref .",
    "the collision integrals can be written as @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the spin - summed and averaged matrix element including the symmetry factor @xmath11 if there are identical particles in initial or final states .",
    "the phase - space factor is @xmath12 .",
    "this collision integral can be reduced to 2 dimensions using the method developed in ref .",
    "however , if pauli blocking and interactions involving only neutrinos are neglected the integrals can in fact be reduced to 1 dimension , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the following",
    "we use this method .",
    "the quantitative error resulting from this is quite small .",
    "in addition to standard weak interactions we allow for a direct decay of @xmath13 to neutrinos , @xmath14 . if @xmath13 is non - relativistic",
    "then each neutrino is born with momentum @xmath15 and in this case the collision integral is @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the branching ratio into neutrino species @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the decay rate of the heavy particle . for simplicity we assume equal branching ratios into all neutrino species . even is this is not the case the neutrino distribution functions will be almost equilibrated by oscillations @xcite .",
    "this means that @xmath20 .",
    "note that if one assumes that neutrinos are in kinetic equilibrium so that they can be described by a single temperature @xmath21 it is in fact possible to solve the boltzmann equation semi - analytically @xcite .",
    "however , this is a very poor approximation for the case when there is a direct decay mode @xmath22 .",
    "we assume the heavy particle to be completely non - relativistic .",
    "if that is the case then the boltzmann equation can be integrated to give the following equation for the evolution of the energy density @xmath23 i.e.  there are no inverse decays .",
    "this is a good approximation for all the cases covered in the present work .",
    "we only work with masses which are low enough that there are no hadronic decay channels open .",
    "this of course severely restricts the possible models .",
    "however , if there is a hadronic branching ratio then the minimum allowed reheating temperature increases dramatically @xcite , and we are investigating what the _ lowest _ possible reheating temperature is .      the evolution of the photon temperature can then be found from the equation of energy conservation @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the total energy density and the total pressure respectively .",
    "this equation can be rewritten as an evolution equation for @xmath27    @xmath28      finally we solve the friedmann equation to find the scale factor as a function of time @xmath29    altogether we solve eq .",

    "( [ eq : boltz ] ) for each neutrino species , eq .  ( [ eq : phi ] ) for @xmath13 , and eq .  ( [ eq : em ] ) for the photon temperature , to obtain @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "following convention we define the reheating temperature of the universe to be when @xmath34 to a reasonable approximation the universe is radiation dominated at this point so that @xmath35 where @xmath36 gev is the reduced planck mass and @xmath37 is the number of degrees of freedom .",
    "this means that there is a one to one correspondence between @xmath19 and @xmath5 , @xmath38 where @xmath39 has been used .",
    "note that the constant of proportionality is somewhat arbitrary ( although it should always be of order 1 ) , and just gives a rough idea about the thermal temperature when the universe enters the standard radiation dominated phase .",
    "as long as the initial time is set so that @xmath40 _ and _ @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the maximum temperature reached by the plasma after time @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the neutrino decoupling temperature then the final outcome is independent of initial conditions .",
    "the universe starts out being strongly matter dominated and the final neutrino energy density , as well as the light element abundances depend only on @xmath19 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 . the initial time is found from the friedmann equation by assuming complete domination of @xmath13 so that @xmath47^{-1/2}$ ] .",
    "one of the main observables from the epoch around neutrino decoupling is the abundance of light elements , mainly helium and deuterium .",
    "in order to calculate these abundances we have modified the kawano nucleosynthesis code @xcite .",
    "first is has been modified to incorporate the modified temperature evolution , and second the subroutines used to calculate weak interaction rates for @xmath48 have been modified to incorporate the full numerical electron neutrino distribution coming from the solution of the coupled boltzmann equations .",
    "this allows us to calculate the abundance of @xmath49he and d for the various models .",
    "we have solved the set of coupled boltzmann equations for all species for the free parameters , @xmath45 , @xmath19 , and @xmath46 .",
    "the main output from this is the relativistic energy density in neutrinos , parameterized in units of the energy density of a standard model neutrino , @xmath50 , @xmath51      if @xmath52 then the equations become independent of @xmath45 and this case has already been covered in ref .",
    "we present this as our first case in order to compare results with those of @xcite .",
    "[ fig : nnu1 ] shows the effective number of neutrino species , @xmath53 , after complete decay of @xmath13 .",
    "this figure is identical to fig .  4 in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "= 7truecm    we also test whether our results are independent of initial conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : ic ] we show @xmath31 and @xmath32 for @xmath54 for two different initial times , @xmath55 s and @xmath56 s. in both cases we assume an initial photon temperature of 2.3 mev ( we could equally well have chosen an initial temperature of 0 ) .",
    "while the maximum temperature reached is clearly dependent on @xmath43 , @xmath27 and @xmath57 quickly become indistinguishable , and as long as the temperature where this happens is greater than the neutrino decoupling temperature all final results are independent of @xmath43 .",
    "furthermore , as expected @xcite , the photon temperature scales as @xmath58 during the matter dominated period and shifts to the usual @xmath59 once the universe becomes radiation dominated ( except for a small deviation due to heating by @xmath60 annihilation ) .",
    "= 11truecm      next we cover the case when @xmath61 .",
    "this is much more complicated to solve numerically because of the presence of the delta function @xmath62 and the fact that the solution now depends on both @xmath46 and @xmath45 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu2 ] we show @xmath53 for different values of @xmath19 and @xmath46 .",
    "= 12truecm    from this figure is clear that when @xmath46 is small the effective number of neutrino species becomes independent of @xmath45 and increasing with @xmath19 , with @xmath63 for @xmath64 .    for the opposite case when",
    "@xmath65 ( only decay to neutrinos ) the situation is the opposite . when @xmath66 the limiting value is again @xmath67",
    "this corresponds to the case when @xmath13 decays into neutrinos , but the effective neutrino temperature after complete @xmath13 decay is higher than @xmath68 .    when @xmath69 the effective number of neutrino species goes to infinity .",
    "this corresponds to the case when @xmath13 decays so slowly that the produced neutrinos never equilibrate with the electromagnetic plasma , leaving only neutrinos .",
    "however , there is a large intermediate region where @xmath70 , even for @xmath65 .",
    "the reason for this unexpected feature can be explained as follows : when high energy neutrinos @xmath71 are produced by direct @xmath13 decay they have a very high annihilation cross section to @xmath72 , because the cross section goes as @xmath73 .",
    "however , the produced electrons and positrons are immediately converted into a sea of low energy @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 because of electromagnetic interactions .",
    "this means that the production rate of neutrinos is much lower . in the case where the reheating temperature is very high",
    "this does not matter because the universe still has time to thermalize completely after @xmath13 decay .",
    "however , if @xmath77 , this is not possible and the result is that @xmath70 because of the very efficient conversion of neutrinos into @xmath72 .",
    "notice also that this effect becomes less pronounced when @xmath45 decreases because neutrinos are born with energies closer to @xmath78 , and the mismatch between forward and backward rates becomes smaller .    in figs .",

    "conversely , in fig .",
    "[ fig : dist2 ] , which shows @xmath79 , @xmath82 , and @xmath81 mev , it can be seen that the decay rate is high enough that neutrinos equilibrate with the electromagnetic plasma , except for a small deviation around @xmath83 .",

    "in order to constrain the parameters @xmath46 , @xmath19 , and @xmath45 we compare the predicted values of @xmath53 , @xmath49he , and d with the observationally determined values .",
    "in addition to the parameters directly related to @xmath13 the nucleosynthesis outcome depends crucially on the baryon density , @xmath85",
    ".    taken at face value the recent cmb data from the wmap satellite constrain @xmath86 tightly .",
    "however , it has been shown that there is a significant correlation between @xmath86 and @xmath53 in the cmb data .",
    "this means that it is not possible to take cmb constraint on @xmath86 directly and apply it to the nucleosynthesis calculations .",
    "rather a full cmb likelihood analysis for @xmath53 and @xmath86 must be carried out .",
    "this can then be combined with the nucleosynthesis likelihood analysis for @xmath46 , @xmath19 , @xmath45 , and @xmath86 .",
    "first the following subsection covers the current observational status , then the next covers the constraints on decay parameters which can be obtained .",
    "the primordial helium abundance has been derived by two independent groups .",
    "fields and olive @xcite find the value @xmath87 whereas izotov and thuan @xcite find @xmath88    because of this inconsistency we blow up the error bars on @xmath89 and use the value @xmath90 which encompasses the allowed regions of both observational determinations .    the most recent determination of the primordial deuterium abundance has yielded the value @xcite @xmath91    a determination of the primordial lithium abundance has also been performed by several groups . however , this measurement is prone to large systematics and we refrain from using it here .",
    "the cmb temperature fluctuations are conveniently described in terms of the spherical harmonics power spectrum @xmath92 where @xmath93 since thomson scattering polarizes light there are additional power spectra coming from the polarization anisotropies .",
    "the polarization can be divided into a curl - free @xmath94 and a curl @xmath95 component , yielding four independent power spectra : @xmath96 and the temperature @xmath97-polarization cross - correlation @xmath98 .",
    "the wmap experiment have reported data on @xmath99 and @xmath98 , as described in ref .",
    "@xcite    we have performed the likelihood analysis using the prescription given by the wmap collaboration which includes the correlation between different @xmath100 s @xcite .",
    "foreground contamination has already been subtracted from their published data .",
    "the 2df galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) @xcite has measured the redshifts of more than 230 000 galaxies with a median redshift of @xmath101 .",
    "an initial estimate of the convolved , redshift - space power spectrum of the 2dfgrs has been determined @xcite for a sample of 160 000 redshifts . on scales",
    "@xmath102 the data are robust and the shape of the power spectrum is not affected by redshift - space or nonlinear effects , though the amplitude is increased by redshift - space distortions .",
    "a potential complication is the fact that the galaxy power spectrum may be biased with respect to the matter power spectrum , i.e. light does not trace mass exactly at all scales .",
    "this is often parametrised by introducing a bias factor @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the power spectrum of the galaxies , and @xmath105 is the matter power spectrum .",
    "however , we restrict our analysis of the 2dfgrs power spectrum to scales @xmath106 where the power spectrum is well described by linear theory . on these scales ,",
    "two different analyses have demonstrated that the 2dfgrs power spectrum is consistent with linear , scale - independent bias @xcite .",
    "thus , the shape of the galaxy power spectrum can be used straightforwardly to constrain the shape of the matter power spectrum .",
    "the only parameters which affect cmb and structure formation are the baryon density , @xmath86 , and the relativistic energy density at late times , parameterized by @xmath53 @xcite ( see also ) .",
    "it is therefore relatively straightforward to perform the cmb+lss likelihood analysis .",
    "nucleosynthesis is affected both by the expansion rate around @xmath107 mev , and by the electron neutrino distribution function .",
    "the reason is that electron neutrino enter directly in the weak reactions which interconvert protons and neutrons .",
    "the specific neutrino distributions are therefore found as functions of temperature and used in a modified version of the kawano bbn code @xcite .",
    "this is then used to calculate primordial abundances of deuterium and helium .    for calculating the theoretical cmb and matter power spectra we use the publicly available cmbfast package @xcite .",
    "as the set of cosmological parameters we choose @xmath108 , the matter density , @xmath109 , the baryon density , @xmath110 , the hubble parameter , @xmath111 , the optical depth to reionization , @xmath112 , the normalization of the cmb power spectrum , @xmath113 , the bias parameter , and the effective number of neutrino species @xmath53 , found from the solution of the boltzmann equations .",
    "we assume neutrinos to be almost massless .",
    "we restrict the analysis to geometrically flat models @xmath114 .",
    "for each individual model we calculate @xmath115 in the following way : given a theoretical cmb spectrum the @xmath115 of the wmap data is calculated using the method described in ref .  @xcite . with regards to the 2df data we use the data points and window functions from ref .",

    "[ fig : excl1 ] we show 68% and 95% exclusion limits for @xmath86 and @xmath19 from bbn , cmb , and lss .",
    "the top panel for bbn only is very similar to fig .  8 in kks , except that we use slightly different bounds on light element abundances . from bbn alone",
    "the 95% bound on @xmath5 is roughly 0.6 mev .",
    "however this bound is achieved for relatively low @xmath86 , whereas cmb+lss strongly prefer a high value of @xmath86 . therefore combining the bbn and cmb+lss constraints",
    "removes the low @xmath5 region and increases the lower bound to 3.9 mev .",
    "= 11truecm    = 12truecm      apart from the fact that @xmath53 depends on @xmath46 there is a second effect which is just a important .",
    "when @xmath61 there are more high energy neutrinos . around weak freeze - out",
    "there are many more protons than neutrons .",
    "when @xmath118 the weak absorption cross section is equal on protons and neutrons .",
    "this means that additional neutrinos at high energies will have the net effect of converting protons into neutrons , so that in the end more helium is produced .",
    "note that this is the opposite effect of just increasing the weak interaction rates , in which case _ less _ helium would be produced .",
    "the phenomenon is quite similar to what happens if @xmath13 has a hadronic decay channel . in that case",
    "pions and kaons will be produced , which subsequently convert protons to neutrons and lead to overproduction of helium .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : excl2 ] we show 68% , 95% , and 99.99% confidence exclusion plots for @xmath19 and @xmath45 , marginalized over @xmath86 .    both when @xmath46 is small and when @xmath79 the bound on @xmath119 becomes independent of @xmath45 . in both cases",
    "the 95% bound is @xmath0 mev .",
    "however , there is an intermediate regime for @xmath46 which allows for much lower values of @xmath5 .",
    "the reason for this can be seen directly from fig .",
    "[ fig : nnu2 ] , i.e. there is an intermediate range where @xmath53 can be kept close to 3 , even for low @xmath19 .",
    "however , for large masses ( which is of course by far the most likely ) there is no allowed region .",
    "the reason is the one given in the previous section : more high energy neutrinos will produce more helium , and this in turn will conflict with observations .",
    "the final outcome is that for almost all values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 there is a robust lower bound on @xmath5 which is around 4 mev .",
    "however there is a small region where @xmath120 , @xmath121 mev where a reheating temperature as low as roughly 1 mev is allowed .",
    "if @xmath13 is a scalar then the decay rate to neutrinos is normally suppressed by a factor @xmath122 because of the necessary helicity flip .",
    "therefore the simplest assumption is that @xmath13 has no branching into neutrinos .",
    "if for instance the heavy particle is a pseudo - scalar like the axion , then there is an upper bound on the coupling to photons ( @xcite ) , @xmath123 for @xmath124 kev . for higher masses",
    "the bound is significantly weaker .",
    "however , even if this bound is used together with the decay width @xmath125 then we find that @xmath126 which is easily satisfies for the parameter space we are considering .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath13 is a particle like the majoron which couples only to neutrinos then the decay width is @xcite @xmath127 the bound on the dimensionless coupling constant comes from bbn as well as supernova considerations and is of order @xmath128 for majorons in the mev mass range @xcite . for more massive majorons the bound weakens .",
    "again it is clear that the decay parameters which we consider here are not excluded by any other astrophysical or experimental data .",
    "the final conclusion is that heavy , decaying particles such as the ones considered here can not be directly excluded by any current data .",
    "furthermore a branching ratio into neutrinos can be anywhere from 0 to 1 .",
    "we have carefully calculated constraints on models with extremely low reheating temperature , where a massive particle decays around @xmath129 mev . by combining constraints on light element abundances with constraints on @xmath86 and @xmath53 from cmb and large scale structure we derived a fairly robust limit of @xmath130",
    "this bound is a significant improvement over the previous bound of @xmath131 mev , calculated from bbn alone .",
    "it is interesting that the lower bound is significantly higher than the @xmath48 conversion freeze - out temperature , @xmath132 mev , end even higher than the neutrino decoupling temperature @xmath133 mev .",
    "this shows that even small residual effects can be measured with present observational data .",
    "models with reheating temperature in the mev regime are in general difficult to reconcile with such features as baryogenesis .",
    "however , in models with large extra dimensions a low reheating temperature is essential in order to avoid overproduction of massive kaluza - klein graviton states .",
    "this means that we can use our present bound to derive limits on the compactification scale in such models . for the case of two extra dimensions",
    "the bound is @xmath3 tev and for @xmath4 it is @xmath134 tev .",
    "this bound is somewhat stronger than the bound coming from considerations of neutron star cooling and gamma ray emission .",
