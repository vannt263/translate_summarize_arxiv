    "first - principles calculations based on the density functional theory ( dft ) have been eminently successful for the study of ground state properties of electrons in a solid @xcite .",
    "however , it has always been understood that the spectrum and wave - functions of the associated one - electron like kohn - sham equation have no specific significance beyond the fact that they are used to obtain the ground - state density @xcite .",
    "thus the unoccupied part of the kohn - sham spectrum can not be expected to describe correctly the excitations of a many - electron system . on the other hand ,",
    "the energy eigenvalue of the highest occupied orbital , i.e. the orbital energy corresponding to the top of the valence band , is the exact ionization potential of the system @xcite .",
    "this is known as the ionization potential theorem . since adding an extra electron at the bottom of the conduction band",
    "would hardly change the density of a bulk system , the ionization potential theorem leads one to expect that the difference in the kohn - sham orbital energies corresponding to the bottom of the conduction band and the top of the valence band should give the correct band gap of semiconductors and insulators .",
    "however it is well known that such an interpretation leads to gross underestimatation of the band gaps of semiconductors in comparison to the experiments .",
    "this is true even in solids like ge , si and the iii - v semi - conductors which are not  strongly correlated \" .",
    "this underestimation of the band gap has been explained in terms of the derivative discontinuity @xcite of the exchange - correlation energy functional . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we propose to look at the calculation of the band gap as an excited - state problem . as such",
    ", the question we ask is : could we set up a dft for excited states , calculate the total energy for appropriate excited - state and obtain the excitation energy as its difference from the ground state total energy .",
    "we may then go on to interpret the band gap in a semi - conductor as the difference of the energies between the ground state and an excited state where an electron in the highest occupied ( ho ) state of the ground state is removed from it and excited to the lowest unoccupied ( lu ) state .",
    "the mathematical basis of a density functional theory for total energies in excited states had been set up by grling @xcite and levy and nagy @xcite , based on the constrained search approach @xcite .",
    "the theory has been put on a strong footing by samal and harbola @xcite .",

    ", the exchange - correlation energy functional in excited - state theory too has to be approximated .",
    "the problem of finding an excited - state exchange - correlation energy functional is a challenging one and is further compounded by the fact that the functional is expected to be state dependent .",
    "thus different functionals may have to be constructed for different classes of the excited - states .",
    "recently , samal and harbola @xcite have proposed a local - density approximation ( lda ) for the exchange energy functional for a theory of excited - states with one gap .",
    "the functional has been applied to a large number of atomic excited - states to obtain very accurate excitation energies for single and double - electron excitations .",
    "the functional has precisely the form required to calculate band - gaps of semiconductors using excited - state dft .",
    "the purpose of the present work is then to employ this excited - state dft to obtain the band - gaps of a number of semiconducting and insulating materials . in the following we give a brief description of the methodology employed by us and",

    "as we discussed earlier , the band gap in a semiconductor or an insulator can be thought of as the lowest energy required to excite one electron out of a many - electron ground state to one of the excited states of the system .",

    "note that for the sake of notational clarity the bi - functional notation for the excited state functionals in the above equation has been dropped .",
    "there have been many attempts at obtaining accurate but approximate forms for the exchange - correlation functional for the ground state .",
    "the simplest of them , the lda , follows the dirac @xcite approach and proposes the functional on the basis of exchange energy for the homogeneous electron - gas . as mentioned above , adopting the same approach , samal and harbola @xcite proposed an excited - state functional for the exchange - energy and applied it to atoms to obtain accurate excited - state energies . in the following we discuss the construction of such a functional for semi - conductors and insulators and employ it to get the band gap of these materials as defined by eq.([eq5 ] ) above .",
    "the accuracy or otherwise of our proposition will be evident from the applications to several semi - conductors and insulators .",
    "the standard procedure for setting up of the exchange - correlation functional is to start from the equivalent expression for the homogeneous electron gas ( heg ) .",

    "is removed from that state and now occupies the lowest unoccupied state . for the heg this excited state configuration corresponds to the following :",

    "the ground state density is @xmath44 and the excited state density is @xmath45 . note that in an excited state of the system the electrons will occupy the @xmath46-space differently from the ground state .",
    "0.2 cm as stated before , the standard starting point for building up the ground state exchange - correlation functional , whose exact form is in general unknown , is the exact expression for the heg .",

    "if the sum of the last two terms is small , we may expect the kohn - sham gap to be the band - gap .",
    "however , we expect the major correction to the conventional kohn - sham gap to come from these terms .",
    "what these terms accomplish is to replace the lda exchange energy corresponding to the excited - state density @xmath21 by the mlda exchange energy .",
    "the latter is tailor - made - and therefore more appropriate - for getting exchange energy for an excited - state of the kind considered for the band gap calculation .",
    "we note that the functional proposed by samal and harbola also has self - interaction correction ( sic ) terms in it . for extended systems we expect these terms to be negligible and",
    "shall justify our assumption by application to a few of the systems studied by us .",
    "we shall base our calculations in solids on the tight - binding linear muffin - tin orbitals method within the atomic - sphere approximation ( tb - lmto - asa ) @xcite-@xcite . in this method",
    "the muffin - tin spheres are inflated to the wigner - seitz cell volume and the interstitial contribution is neglected .",

    "tail cancellation ensures that the muffin - tin orbitals labelled by @xmath61 vanish outside the atomic spehers centered at @xmath61 .",
    "the quantum states of the electrons in the solid are labelled by the quantum numbers @xmath66 .    from the kohn - sham band - structure we can identify the ho and lu states in reciprocal space . using these values of @xmath67",
    "we construct the removed and added electron densities .",
    "the core electron density is obtained from the atomic - like the core states .",
    "these expressions are then used in equations ( [ eq10])-([eq14 ] ) to obtain the band gap .",
    "we again point out that both the ground- and the excited - state densities are constructed from a single ground - state calculation .",
    "this is justified since one does not expect lowest unoccupied state to change much even if an excited - state ks calculation is performed .",
    "an advantage of this is that the computational demand of our calculations is pretty much at the same level as the ground - state calculations .",
    "application of our methodology to molecules and clusters have already been carried out without any difficulty earlier @xcite-@xcite . however , in its application to solids there have been two points of confusion .",
    "this is related to the fact that in a bulk solid the extended bloch - like electronic wave - functions for a given quantum state are infinitely thinly spread over the whole solid .",
    "the charge densities corresponding to a single quantum state are also @xmath68(1 ) while the charge density of the valence cloud is @xmath68(n ) ( @xmath69 is the number of atoms ) if it scales as @xmath70 with the number @xmath69 of atomic - spheres in the system .",
    "for example , total energy is @xmath71 while the energy per atom is @xmath72 . ] .",
    "there are two questions we must answer : first , are we really exciting a _ single _ electron out of a sea of @xmath69 ( @xmath73 ) electrons , from the ho to the lu state ? secondly , can we use this infinitely small ( @xmath68(1 ) as compared to @xmath68(n ) ) change to produce the finite energy differences which we define to be the band gap in eq .",
    "( [ eq14 ] ) ?    in this section",
    "we shall argue that the way we obtain the energy differences within the lmto technique by normalizing the solution within a wigner - seitz cell and considering only energies per cell addresses this problem successfully .",
    "we should also note that the arguments given is not confined to the lmto , but holds good for any electronic structure method that are based on  cellular \" techniques , e.g. kkr , apw or lapw .",
    "as we have seen earlier , quantum states of electrons in a solid are labeled by @xmath67 .",
    "if there are @xmath74 atoms constituting the solid each contributing @xmath75 electrons to the valence electron cloud , then the total number @xmath76 of available states are occupied , each state by one electron .",
    "if @xmath77 is the total charge density of occupied electron states , then    @xmath78    in all electronic structure techniques which divide the solid into identical wigner - seitz cells ( wsc ) centered at the sites @xmath61 such that : @xmath79    where @xmath80 is the volume of the solid and @xmath81 that of a wsc centered at @xmath61 , the basis of representation are wsc centered functions of the form :    @xmath82    @xmath83 is a composite index , which for the kkr or the apw and their linearized versions , lmto and lapw , denote the angular momenta indices @xmath84 .",
    "these basis functions are centered at wscs and do not overlap .",
    "the charge density also may be broken up as :    @xmath85    note that each quantum state labelled by can be occupied by a single electron . here",
    "@xmath86 is the occupation number of the quantum state labelled by @xmath67 .",
    "for example , in the ground state @xmath76 of the lowest energy states are occupied , so @xmath76 of the @xmath87 are 1 the rest are 0 . in a crystalline solid ,",
    "the densities within each wsc labelled by @xmath61 are identical .",
    "however , since these partial charge densities have the same structure as eq .",
    "( [ a1 ] ) , and are 0 outside the wsc labeled by @xmath61 , we shall retain this label to indicate this .",
    "from the above it is clear that , since @xmath77 integrates to @xmath76 over @xmath69 wsc :    @xmath88    in the output of the cellular methods ( including the kkr , apw , lmto , lapw ) , the charge densities per wsc are scaled such that they are normalized to 1 within a cell .",
    "@xmath89    so that the _ scaled _ charge densities per @xmath67 labelled state which we get as output from the cellular methods are related to the true charge densities per state as  :    @xmath90    if we now remove or add a scaled charge density @xmath91 integrating to 1 in a wsc , then that is equivalent to removing or adding a true charge density integrating to 1/n in that cell . the total charge density added or removed in the whole solid then integrates over the whole volume to 1 . in other words",
    ", we _ are _ exciting 1 electron from the valence cloud in the solid from the ho to lu state .",
