    "the evidence that dark matter is required to make sense of our universe has been building for some time . in 1933",

    "@xcite measured the rotation curves of individual galaxies and also found evidence for non - luminous matter .",
    "this and other `` classic '' evidence for non - luminous matter ( see , _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) has now been supplemented by data from weak  @xcite and strong  @xcite lensing , hot gas in clusters  @xcite , the bullet cluster  @xcite , big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn )  @xcite , further constraints from large scale structure  @xcite , distant supernovae  @xcite , and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb )  @xcite .    together",
    ", these data now provide overwhelming evidence for the remarkable fact that not only is there non - luminous matter in our universe , but most of it is not composed of baryons or any of the other known particles .",
    "current data imply that dark matter is five times more prevalent than normal matter and accounts for about a quarter of the universe .",
    "more precisely , these data constrain the energy densities of the universe in baryons , non - baryonic dark matter ( dm ) , and dark energy @xmath0 to be  @xcite @xmath1    despite this progress , all of the evidence for dark matter noted above is based on its gravitational interactions . given the universality of gravity , this evidence does little to pinpoint what dark matter is . at the same time , the identity of dark matter has far - reaching implications : in astrophysics , the properties of dark matter determine how structure forms and impact the past and future evolution of the universe ; and in particle physics , dark matter is the leading empirical evidence for new particles , and there are striking hints that it may be linked to attempts to understand electroweak symmetry breaking , the leading puzzle in the field today .",
    "the identity of dark matter is therefore of central importance in both fields and ties together studies of the universe at both the largest and smallest observable length scales .    in this review , we discuss some of the leading dark matter candidates and their implications for experiments and observatories .",
    "the wealth of recent cosmological data does constrain some dark matter properties , such as its self - interactions and its temperature at the time of matter - radiation equality .",
    "nevertheless , it is still not at all difficult to invent new particles that satisfy all the constraints , and there are candidates motivated by minimality , particles motivated by possible experimental anomalies , and exotic possibilities motivated primarily by the desire of clever iconoclasts to highlight how truly ignorant we are about the nature of dark matter .    here",
    "we will focus on dark matter candidates that are motivated not only by cosmology , but also by robust problems in particle physics .",
    "for this reason , this review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics , highlighting its basic features and some of its problems .",
    "as we will see , particle physics provides strong motivation for new particles , and in many cases , these particles have just the right properties to be dark matter .",
    "we will find that many of them predict signals that are within reach of current and near future experiments .",
    "we will also find that unusual predictions for astrophysics emerge , and that cold and collisionless dark matter is far from a universal prediction , even for candidates with impeccable particle physics credentials . at the same time",

    "they may be divided into three categories :    * _ spin 1/2 fermions . _",
    "these matter particles include six flavors of quarks ( up , down , charm , strange , bottom , and top ) , three flavors of charged leptons ( electrons , muons , and taus ) , and three flavors of neutral leptons ( the electron , muon , and tau neutrinos ) .",
    "these are grouped into three generations , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm_particles ] .",
    "* _ spin 1 gauge bosons .",
    "_ these force carrying particles include the photon @xmath17 , which mediates electromagnetism ; eight gluons @xmath18 , which mediate the strong force ; and the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauge bosons , which mediate the weak interactions .",

    "the sm higgs particle is a spin 0 boson .",
    "although the higgs boson has not yet been discovered , its mass is constrained by a variety of collider results . assuming the sm",
    ", null results from direct searches at the lep @xmath21 collider require @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "given this constraint , precision measurements of electroweak observables at lep require @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "in addition , the tevatron @xmath24 collider , currently running , excludes the region @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "these bounds may be relaxed in extensions of the sm , but even in such theories , very general arguments require @xmath26 ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite ) .",
    "none of these sm particles is a good dark matter candidate .",
    "most of the matter particles are unstable , with lifetimes far shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "the remaining particles are the six lightest : the electron , the up and down quarks , which may form stable protons and neutrons in nuclei , and the three neutrinos .",
    "electrons may contribute significantly to dark matter only if they are neutralized through binding with protons , but protons ( and neutrons ) contribute to the baryonic energy density @xmath27 , which is too small to be all of dark matter .",
    "in addition , current upper bounds on neutrino masses from particle physics and cosmology imply that the neutrino relic density @xmath28  @xcite .",
    "the evidence for dark matter therefore requires particles beyond the sm .",
    "in addition to the need for dark matter , other problems motivate physics beyond the sm .",
    "these problems are of two types .",
    "the first and most severe are experimental data that the sm can not explain ; at present , aside from the existence of dark matter , these are confined to the neutrino sector and are described in sec .",
    "[ sec : neutrinoproblem ] .",
    "the second are experimental data that can be explained , but only for seemingly unnatural choices of parameters .",
    "all of the remaining problems are of this type .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is the question of why the physical higgs boson mass @xmath29 is so small .",
    "what is the natural value for @xmath29 ?",
    "we know of three fundamental constants : the speed of light @xmath30 , planck s constant @xmath31 , and newton s gravitational constant @xmath11 .",
    "one combination of these has dimensions of mass , the planck mass @xmath32 .",
    "we therefore expect dimensionful parameters to be either 0 , if enforced by a symmetry , or of the order of @xmath12 . in the sm",
    ", electroweak symmetry is broken , and the higgs boson mass is non - zero .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is the question of why @xmath33 .",
    "this problem is exacerbated in the sm by quantum corrections .",
    "the physical mass of the sm higgs boson is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the tree - level mass , and @xmath36 is the quantum correction resulting from loop - level diagrams , where the integral is over the momenta of particles in the loops . the parameter @xmath37 is an @xmath38 dimensionless coupling , and @xmath0 is the energy scale at which the sm is no longer a valid description of nature .",
    "because @xmath39 is proportional to @xmath40 , it is natural to expect the higgs mass to be pulled up to within an order of magnitude of @xmath0 by quantum corrections . in the sm with @xmath41 , this implies that @xmath35 and @xmath39 must cancel to 1 part in @xmath42 to yield the correct physical higgs mass , which is hardly reasonable .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem may be eliminated if @xmath43 , implying new physics at the weak scale @xmath44 .",
    "alternatively , the higgs boson may not be a fundamental scalar , but in this case , too , its structure requires new physics at the weak scale  @xcite . for these reasons ,",
    "every attempt to ameliorate the gauge hierarchy problem so far has implied new particles with mass around @xmath45 .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem is the leading motivation for dark matter candidates , such as wimps and superwimps , weakly- and superweakly - interacting massive particles , that are the topics of secs .",
    "[ sec : wimps ] and [ sec : superwimps ] below .",
    "the gauge hierarchy problem implies new particles with mass around @xmath45 .",
    "such particles typically create many new problems , however , because they may violate baryon number , lepton number , flavor , or cp , where c and p are the discrete transformations of charge conjugation and parity , respectively .",
    "these symmetries are either beautifully preserved or violated only slightly in the sm , but there is no guarantee that new @xmath45 particles will preserve them .",
    "this set of problems is collectively known as the new physics flavor problem .",
    "the new physics flavor problem implies that not all solutions to the gauge hierarchy problem are equally elegant .",
    "for example , among supersymmetric theories , it implies that those that naturally predict very heavy squarks and sleptons , or those that predict squarks and sleptons that are highly degenerate across different generations , are favored , because these naturally suppress flavor - changing neutral currents below current constraints .",
    "this problem has implications for the direct detection of wimps , as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : direct ] , and motivates light gravitino dark matter , reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lightgravitinos ] , and some of the hidden sector dark matter models described in sec .  [ sec : hidden ] .",
    "fermion masses are described in quantum field theories by terms that couple left- and right - handed fields together . in the sm , however , there are no right - handed neutrino fields , and",
    "so the sm predicts that all neutrinos are massless .",
    "the observation of neutrino flavor oscillations  @xcite , however , implies that the three neutrinos are non - degenerate , and so at least two are massive .",
    "neutrino masses and mixing provide the most direct and compelling evidence that the sm of particle physics is incomplete , and this problem motivates sterile neutrino dark matter , discussed in sec .  [ sec : sterileneutrinos ] .",
    "the sm lagrangian includes the term @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the coupling of the strong interactions , @xmath48 is an angle parameter , @xmath49 is the totally anti - symmetric 4-index tensor , and @xmath50 is the gluon field strength .",
    "this term contributes to cp - violating , flavor - conserving observables , such as the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the neutron @xmath51 . for @xmath52 ,",
    "one expects @xmath53 .",
    "the neutron edm has not yet been observed , but current constraints already imply @xmath54  @xcite .",
    "this is therefore a fine - tuning problem of 1 part in @xmath55 , and it motivates axions as dark matter candidates , to be discussed in sec .  [ sec : axions ] .",
    "in addition to the outstanding problems discussed above , there are other open questions raised by the sm .",
    "the _ sm flavor problem _",
    ", distinct from the new physics flavor problem , is the puzzle of why the fermion masses have such different values , as evident in fig .",
    "[ fig : sm_particles ] .",
    "the _ grand unification problem _ is the problem of trying to understand the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions as different manifestations of a single underlying force . in addition , at any given time there are always _ experimental anomalies _ , measurements that do not agree with sm predictions . at present , the most compelling and persistent discrepancy is in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon , which disagrees with the sm prediction at the level of 3.4@xmath56  @xcite .",
    "although the problems described in this paragraph do not typically motivate dark matter candidates on their own , they do sometimes play a supporting role , as discussed below .",
    "finally , note that @xmath57 is only one of two dimensionful parameters in the sm : there is also the term @xmath58 , which contributes to dark energy or the cosmological constant .",
    "equation  ( [ lambda ] ) implies that the total energy density in dark energy is @xmath59 .",
    "if the natural value of @xmath60 is @xmath61 , it must cancel other contributions to 1 part in @xmath62 , a fine - tuning that dwarfs even the gauge hierarchy problem .",
    "this is the _ cosmological constant problem_. although one might hope for a unified solution to the cosmological constant and dark matter problems , at present there is little indication that they are related , and we will assume they are decoupled in this review .",
    "wimps have mass in the range @xmath63 and tree - level interactions with the @xmath19 and @xmath20 gauge bosons , but not with gluons or photons .",
    "wimps are the most studied dark matter candidates , as they are found in many particle physics theories , naturally have the correct relic density , and may be detected in many ways . in this section ,",
    "we discuss their production through thermal freeze out , the examples of neutralino and kaluza - klein dark matter , and their implications for direct detection , indirect detection , and particle colliders .",
    "if a wimp exists and is stable , it is naturally produced with a relic density consistent with that required of dark matter .",
    "this tantalizing fact , sometimes referred to as the `` wimp miracle , '' implies that particles that are motivated by the gauge hierarchy problem , a purely microphysical puzzle , are excellent dark matter candidates .",
    "dark matter may be produced in a simple and predictive manner as a thermal relic of the big bang  @xcite .",
    "the evolution of a thermal relic s number density is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] .",
    "initially the early universe is dense and hot , and all particles are in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the universe then cools to temperatures @xmath64 below the dark matter particle s mass @xmath65 , and the number of dark matter particles becomes boltzmann suppressed , dropping exponentially as @xmath66 .",
    "the number of dark matter particles would drop to zero , except that , in addition to cooling , the universe is also expanding . in stage ( 3 ) , the universe becomes so large and the gas of dark matter particles becomes so dilute that they can not find each other to annihilate .",
    "the dark matter particles then `` freeze out , '' with their number asymptotically approaching a constant , their thermal relic density . note that freeze out ,",
    "also known as chemical decoupling , is distinct from kinetic decoupling ; after thermal freeze out , interactions that change the number of dark matter particles become negligible , but interactions that mediate energy exchange between dark matter and other particles may remain efficient .",

    "the dashed contour is the number density of a particle that remains in thermal equilibrium .",
    "[ fig : freezeout ] ]    this process is described quantitatively by the boltzmann equation @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the number density of the dark matter particle @xmath16 , @xmath73 is the hubble parameter , @xmath74 is the thermally averaged annihilation cross section , and @xmath75 is the dark matter number density in thermal equilibrium . on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ boltzmann ] ) , the first term accounts for dilution from expansion .",
    "the @xmath76 term arises from processes @xmath77 that destroy @xmath16 particles , where sm denotes sm particles , and the @xmath78 term arises from the reverse process @xmath79 , which creates @xmath16 particles .    the thermal relic density is determined by solving the boltzmann equation numerically .",
    "a rough analysis is highly instructive , however . defining freeze out to be the time when @xmath80 , we have @xmath81 where the subscripts @xmath82 denote quantities at freeze out .",
    "the ratio @xmath83 appears in the exponential .",
    "it is , therefore , highly insensitive to the dark matter s properties and may be considered a constant ; a typical value is @xmath84 .",
    "the thermal relic density is , then , @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the critical density and the subscripts @xmath87 denote present day quantities .",
    "we see that the thermal relic density is insensitive to the dark matter mass @xmath65 and inversely proportional to the annihilation cross section @xmath88 .",
    "although @xmath65 does not enter @xmath89 directly , in many theories it is the only mass scale that determines the annihilation cross section . on dimensional grounds , then , the cross section can be written @xmath90 where the factor @xmath91 is absent or present for @xmath92- or @xmath67-wave annihilation , respectively , and terms higher - order in @xmath93 have been neglected .",

    "the width of the band comes from considering both @xmath92- and @xmath67-wave annihilation , and from letting @xmath95 vary from @xmath96 to 2 .",
    "we see that a particle that makes up all of dark matter is predicted to have mass in the range @xmath97 ; a particle that makes up 10% of dark matter has mass @xmath98 .",
    "this is the wimp miracle : weak - scale particles make excellent dark matter candidates .",
    "we have neglected many details here , and there are models for which @xmath95 lies outside our illustrative range , sometimes by as much as an order of magnitude or two .",
    "nevertheless , the wimp miracle implies that many models of particle physics easily provide viable dark matter candidates , and it is at present the strongest reason to expect that central problems in particle physics and astrophysics may in fact be related .",

    ", the photon energy determines the neutrino s mass @xmath464 , the intensity determines the neutrino mixing angle ( @xmath465 ) , and the image morphology determines the dark matter s spatial distribution . from the mass and radial distribution",
    ", theorists determine the free - streaming length .",
    "this favors production from higgs decays over production by oscillations , leading to predictions of non - standard higgs phenomenology , which are then confirmed at the lhc .",
    "additional information on neutrino parameters from the lhc strengthens the hypothesis of sterile neutrino dark matter , and the energy distribution of the narrow spectral line is then used to study the expansion history of the universe and dark energy .",
    "these scenarios are , of course , highly speculative and idealized , but they illustrate that , even in ideal scenarios that we have studied and understand , close interactions between many subfields will be required . at the same time , if any of the ideas discussed here is correct , there are promising prospects for the combination of detection methods in particle physics and astrophysics to identify dark matter in the not - so - distant future .",
