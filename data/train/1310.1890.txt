    "nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) and transport properties play a fundamental role in the understanding of many aspects of nuclear physics and astrophysics .",
    "for instance , neutron star genesis and cooling , as well as the possible occurrence of hybrid structures , transition to the deconfined phase and black - hole formation , are strongly influenced by nuclear compressibility and viscosity  @xcite .",
    "heavy ion collisions ( hic ) offer the unique possibility to create , in terrestrial laboratories , transient states of nuclear matter in a wide range of density , temperature and n / z asymmetry , thus making it possible to access information on fundamental properties of nuclear systems far from normal conditions . indeed relevant indications on the stiffness of the eos at supra - saturation densities and on in - medium modifications of the two - body nucleon - nucleon cross section have emerged from the study of collective flows and degree of stopping measured in heavy ion reactions at relativistic energies  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that collective flows are also widely investigated in the context of ultra - relativistic hic , in connection with the occurrence of phase transitions to the deconfined quark - gluon - plasma phase and its viscosity  @xcite .    generally speaking , reaction mechanisms in the fermi energy domain ( 20 - 50 mev / nucleon ) reflect an interesting interplay between mean - field ( one - body ) properties , dominant at low energies , and the increasing importance of two - body correlations such as nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "in particular , the combined action of nuclear compressibility and nucleon - nucleon cross section governs the compression - expansion dynamics typically observed in central collisions .",
    "the reaction path can then bring the formed excited nuclear system to low density regions where the mean field becomes unstable . in this case",
    "two - body correlations and fluctuations are expected to provide the seeds for fragment formation leading to the occurrence of multifragmentation phenomena which can be described in the framework of a liquid - gas - type phase transition  @xcite .",
    "observed first by the fopi collaboration  @xcite and interpreted as an `` extra push '' with respect to the thermal pressure of an equilibrated composite system , a collective expansion energy has been extracted from experimental data over a wide range of beam energy  @xcite .",
    "several studies of the multifragmentation process , and of the corresponding role of the collective expansion , have been undertaken in the framework of transport theories  @xcite and some analyses  @xcite have pointed out the importance of this effect on fragment formation , looking at , for example , the balance between the amount of radial collective flow and recombination probability  @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , estimates of the radial collective energy present in experimental multifragmentation data have been mostly obtained by employing statistical models  @xcite which treat separately fragment production and collective expansion effects  @xcite .",
    "the main justification is the small contribution of the collective expansion energy  @xcite with respect to the total excitation energy characterizing the fermi energy domain ( around 20 - 30% ) .",
    "nevertheless , even for this amount of expansion , recent experimental analyses show a significant influence on the fragment production  @xcite .    particularly sensitive to the interplay between one- and two - body effects",
    "are also observables characterizing the shape of the reaction events in momentum space .",
    "for instance , the so - called stopping power , which was first investigated by the fopi collaboration at higher beam energies  @xcite , measures the efficiency of conversion of the initial beam energy into transverse directions , as quantified by taking the ratio of total transverse to parallel energy - based quantities . in ref .",
    "@xcite , similar analysis has been done for collisions at fermi energy domain and one result is that full stopping is not achieved .",
    "the aim of this paper is to bring information on the connection between fragmentation features and the underlying collective expansion mechanism , with the help of a transport theory description of the reaction dynamics .",
    "moreover , we will discuss the existence of possible correlations between the evolution of the fragmentation regime and the experimentally - observed trend for the amount of stopping reached in heavy ion reactions at fermi energies .",
    "a combined study of the two features appears as a promising tool to learn about relevant nuclear matter properties .",
    "the reaction dynamics is described in the framework of a semi - classical microscopic transport model , the stochastic mean field ( smf ) approach  @xcite .",
    "this choice fits the requirement to have a well implemented nuclear mean - field dynamics together with the effects of fluctuations induced by two - body scatterings .",
    "central and mid - central collisions will be investigated taking , as reference , the indra data  @xcite for the reactions @xmath0xe+@xmath1sn at 25,32,39,45 and 50 mev / nucleon .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we first review the main ingredients of the smf model , then we briefly present the systems analysed before discussing smf results concerning phase diagram trajectories , pre - fragment formation and recombination .",
    "section iii is devoted to the comparison with indra data : for this purpose we first test , on simulated events , the validity of the adopted central collisions selection , based on the flow angle observable  @xcite . treating in the same way simulations and experimental data ,",
    "we show a comparison of fragment partition properties looking at charge and velocities .",
    "observables related to stopping power in nuclear collisions are introduced and discussed in section iv .",
    "finally , conclusions and perspectives are drawn in section v.",
    "we consider , as starting point , the boltzmann - langevin ( bl ) equation for the time evolution of the semiclassical one - body distribution function @xmath2 : @xmath3+\\delta i[f].\\ ] ] the coordinates of isospin are not shown for brevity .",
    "eq.(1 ) essentially describes the evolution of the system in response to the action of the self - consistent mean - field potential @xmath4 , whereas effects of two - body correlations and fluctuations are incorporated in the collision integral , @xmath5 , and its stochastic part , @xmath6 .",
    "the average term @xmath7 $ ] takes into account the energy , angular and isospin dependence of free nucleon - nucleon cross sections @xcite .",
    "the smf model represents an approximate approach to solve the bl equation , where phase - space fluctuations are projected in coordinate space .",
    "thus the fluctuating term @xmath8 $ ] is implemented through stochastic spatial density fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "we adopt the following parametrization of the mean - field potential : @xmath9 where @xmath10 denotes the density , @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath13,@xmath14 and the exponent @xmath15 , characterizing the isoscalar part of the mean - field , are fixed requiring that the saturation properties of symmetric nuclear matter , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with a compressibility of @xmath18@xmath19 , are reproduced .",
    "this choice corresponds to a skyrme - like effective interaction , namely @xmath20 , for which we consider the effective mass as being equal to the nucleon bare mass .",
    "as far as the isovector part of the nuclear interaction is concerned , we take a constant value of @xmath21 , corresponding to a linear ( stiff ) behavior of the potential part of the symmetry energy , @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "eq.(1 ) is solved adopting the test particle method .",
    "the inclusion of fluctuations in the dynamics allows one to address mechanisms governed by the growth of mean - field instabilities , such as spinodal decomposition , which lead to multifragmentation process  @xcite .",
    "the products generated by the reaction dynamics are reconstructed from the one - body density distribution by applying a coalescence procedure , connecting nearby cells with density larger than a cut - off value . at the end of the dynamical stage ( i.e. at the so - called freeze - out time ) the primary fragments are still hot .",
    "hence the dynamical events are plugged in a statistical de - excitation code , in order to get the properties of the final reaction products .",
    "we adopt the simon code  @xcite , which describes the in - flight secondary de - excitation through the coulomb field .",
    "a drawback of our mean - field based approach is that the production of light charge particles ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) is not well described . indeed",
    "the primary yield of such particles is largely underestimated in the code , thus favouring free nucleon emission . in the following",
    "we will concentrate on the properties of intermediate mass fragments ( imf ) with charge ( z ) greater than 4 .",
    "we performed , for the system @xmath0xe+@xmath1sn , two runs of calculation :    * the first one is dedicated to central collisions .",
    "the range of impact parameter ( b ) is [ 0;4 ] fm by step of 0.5 fm , the beam energies are 25,32,35,39,45 , 50 mev / nucleon . for the lowest beam energies ( 25 and 32 mev / nucleon ) , the possible contribution of larger impact parameters , up to @xmath25 , is considered .",
    "we use 30 test - particles per nucleon and run 1000 events for each system in a 40@xmath2640@xmath2640 @xmath27 box until t=400 fm / c . * the second run is dedicated to the investigation of the stopping power .",
    "we take the same beam energies and enlarge the impact parameter range , b@xmath28[0.5;6.5 ] fm .",
    "we run 100 events for each system in a 80@xmath2680@xmath2680 @xmath27 box until t=440 fm / c .",
    "we consider two values for the density cut - off employed in the coalescence procedure : 0.03 and 0.09 @xmath29 .",
    "the first value corresponds to the standard parameter used in the model @xcite . according to this choice ,",
    "all regions with density lower than 0.03 @xmath29 ( about 1/5 of the saturation density ) are associated with free nucleon emission .",
    "the large cut - off density of 0.09 @xmath29 is used for exploratory purposes .",
    "indeed it allows one to identify high - density peaks ( a kind of early recognition of fragments ) even at early times , when the system is still rather compact , and to investigate the recombination effects during the expansion phase .",
    "the coalescence procedure is applied at each step of 20 fm / c from t=0 fm / c to follow the evolution of the composite system up to fragmentation , and deduce properties such as density and excitation energy .",
    "thus we have access to the corresponding trajectory followed by the composite system in the nuclear matter phase diagram and to the properties , in both position and velocity space , of the formed fragments .",
    "the freeze - out time , defined as the time when primary fragments are well formed and the nuclear interaction among them is almost negligible , corresponds to @xmath30 .",
    "the subsequent propagation in the coulomb field is treated inside the simon code ; 20 simon decays per smf event are performed .",
    "we address the time evolution of the hot composite sources formed in central collisions ( b = 0.5 fm ) .",
    "such collisions are characterized by a compression phase , due to the initial collisional shock , with a subsequent expansion and fragment formation .",
    "the role of compression and expansion phases is studied looking at the mean trajectory of the composite source in the excitation energy ( @xmath31 ) - density ( @xmath10 ) plane .",
    "@xmath31 represents the thermal excitation energy of the composite source , which is evaluated subtracting the kinetic energy associated with the fermi motion ( where the fermi momentum depends on the local density ) from the total kinetic energy .",

    "the almost linear dependence indicates that to first order the potential energy associated with the compression of the system is converted into radial expansion energy in a similar way .",
    "however it seems that from @xmath43=39 mev / nucleon",
    "we see a transition with more efficiency to convert initial compression to subsequent expansion .",
    "we also notice that , for the highest energy , the radial expansion energy reaches 30% of the available kinetic energy , which is in good agreement with experimental estimates deduced from multifragmentation data  @xcite .",
    "the absolute values are also reported in the table  [ tab : recape0 ] ( see section iii.c ) .",
    "after this direct evaluation of the collective radial expansion we will now focus on the production of fragments and its time scale .",
    "when the hot expanding source reaches low density regions , density fluctuations start to play an important role .",
    "indeed they are amplified by the unstable mean - field , leading to the possibility to observe multifragmentation .",
    "multifragmentation is characterized by a simultaneous production of many fragments ( defined in this work as elements with charge z@xmath445 ) .",
    "the excitation energy required for the onset of multifragentation has been derived from comparisons with statistical models  @xcite , and more recently , by measuring the fragment emission time using model - independent coulomb chronometry  @xcite .",
    "these studies show that multifragmentation occurs above @xmath31=4 mev / nucleon , which corresponds to a beam energy of 25 mev / nucleon for the xe+sn central collisions . on the other hand , in smf calculations",

    "the two curves stand for two values of the density cut ( @xmath46 ) used in the coalescence procedure : the usual one ( 0.03@xmath29 , black squares ) and a greater one ( 0.09@xmath29 , red triangles ) , aiming at an easier recognition of fragments in the case of compact configurations .",

    "are observed , indicating that the recombination of nascent partitions is rather fast . on the other hand , at higher energies time scales are longer , but coherent with the picture of a slower continuous evolution towards final fragment partitions in the exit channel .",
    "we conclude that density fluctuations in the low density composite system are sufficient to lead to pre - fragment formation at early times . from this common stage ,",
    "two scenarios are observed : nascent partitions recombine into a composite source or survive leading to multifragmentation .",
    "the amount of collective radial expansion appears to be the main discriminator .",
    "the shift of the multifragmentation threshold towards higher beam energies , as compared to experimental results , indicates an underestimation of the radial expansion .",
    "as it will be shown in the next section , fragment velocities are underestimated also when multifragmentation is observed .",
    "these observations are linked to known limitations of semi - classical models , with respect to a full quantum treatment : indeed semi - classical models are characterized by a reduced capability of the excited nuclear systems to keep particles inside the potential well , due to the lack of quantum reflection effects  @xcite . instead of expanding under the effect of the thermal pressure , the hot system generally emits a large number of particles , reducing its excitation energy and temperature . to quantify the damping of collective flow , we go now into a realistic comparison between smf+simon outputs and indra multifragmentation data .",
    "we now present a comparison between smf calculation outputs and indra data obtained from selected central collisions .",
    "we will seak , in the experiment and in the simulations , for the events which correspond to the disassembly of a unique composite source ( denoted as `` fusion '' events in the following ) . to do so",
    ", we consider smf simulations mainly in the impact parameter ( @xmath51 ) range between 0.5 and 4 fm . in the following",

    ", fragment production and relaxation in momentum space is almost achieved in smf .",

    "angular momentum values are between 0 and 30 @xmath53 . in simon code ,",
    "primary hot fragments are supposed spherical and at normal density .",
    "these asumptions are thus reasonable for fusion events at beam energies above 39 mev / nucleon . for the lowest energies",
    ", the time evolution indicates that smf events which do not break into pieces are not completely relaxed in @xmath54 space and the passage between smf and simon could lose some coherency .",

    "the first step is to test the assumptions made in the data to select the so - called central collisions .",

    "+ in the following we will present the results obtained within the smf + simon approach . from the flow angle distribution studied in the previous section ( fig .",
    "[ fig : thetaflow ] ) , we have already observed favored prolate orientation for events at small impact parameters , indicating the presence of full stopping and a loss of the entrance channel memory . to complete this observation , we perform an analysis similar to the one in  @xcite , on the impact parameter range [ 0.5 ; 6.5 ] fm .",
    "* left panel *  : evolution of total multiplicity ( @xmath68 ) with the impact parameter ; * middle panel *  : for @xmath74 , correlation between the isotropic ratio ( @xmath67 ) and @xmath68 in black contours ( logarithmic scale ) , the full red triangles are the deduced profile . the profile for b=0.5 fm",
    "is plotted in blue circles .",
    "the vertical violet dashed line indicate where the @xmath68 cut is performed ( see text for details ) ; * right panel *  : evolution with beam energies ( @xmath43 ) of mean values of @xmath67 for b=0.5fm ( blue line ) and for events selected using the @xmath68 cut ( violet line ) .",
    "indra data , taken from  @xcite , are plotted in black squares . ]",
    "first , on fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].a , we show the evolution of @xmath68 ( which excludes pre - equilibrium particles ) with the impact parameter ( b ) .",
    "a different behavior is observed for energies below and above 39 mev / nucleon with first an increasing and then a decreasing trend of @xmath68 with respect to b. at small beam energies , the largest @xmath68 is observed at large impact parameters ( @xmath75 ) , corresponding to high spin sequential splitting , whereas the opposite holds at high beam energies .",
    "we notice that at the `` transition energy '' ( 39 mev / nucleon ) we also observe a transition , at small impact parameters , from sequential decay of heavy residue to multifragmentation events .",
    "[ fig : stopping].b shows the correlation between @xmath67 and @xmath68 , as proposed  in  @xcite , at @xmath43=45 mev / nucleon .",
    "we observe the same trend , as seen in the data , for the global population of the diagram ( black contour plot ) and for the mean ( red full triangles ) : saturation of @xmath67 for the highest @xmath68 values and large fluctuations for multiplicities around half of the maximum reached value .",
    "however , this picture is valid for beam energies above 39 mev / nucleon , whereas , at lower energies , the trend of @xmath67 as a function of @xmath68 is rather flat , in the considered impact parameter range .",
    "indeed low multiplicity corresponds to small impact parameters ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : stopping].a ) and at larger impact parameters ( large @xmath68 in this case ) the dynamics is still rather dissipative , thus @xmath67 is around 1 in all cases .     * from left to right *  : energies 39 , 45 and 50 mev / nucleon , the @xmath68 cut is applied to select the most dissipative collisions .",
    "charge ( z ) distribution : black full squares are for indra data and full red line for smf+simon calculations . for the simulated distributions ,",
    "the y - axis scale is in mb , and experimental data are scaled on it . ]",
    "we also plot on fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].b the same correlation just considering b=0.5 fm ( blue points ) .",
    "we observe that a wide @xmath68 region is populated and that @xmath67 values are greater than 1 , indicating that full stopping is achieved for the most central collisions   for b=0.5fm case is done on all events while for the other cases it has been computed event by event .",
    "this allows to avoid spurious fluctuations due to the ratio between small numbers , especially at lower beam energies where , in the majority of events , there is a big residue located near the center of mass . ] .    on fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].c , we report the @xmath67 mean values , corresponding to b=0.5 fm , for all beam energies ( blue lines ) . an almost flat behaviour is observed . to perfom a similar @xmath68 cut in the smf events , applicable to the whole beam energy range",
    ", we consider the value of @xmath68 above which the cross section of the selected events is equal to the value associated with b=0.5 fm ( which corresponds to 3% of the simulated cross section ) . on fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].b , the violet vertical line indicates the @xmath68 cut obtained at @xmath43= 45 mev / nucleon . the violet line on fig .  [ fig : stopping].c represents the evolution of @xmath67 with beam energies , according to this selection .",
    "results from  @xcite are reported as black full squares . at the lowest energies , values are still close to one indicating important dissipative and orbiting effects at large impact parameters .",
    "then , increasing the beam energy up to 39 mev / nucleon , @xmath67 decreases , but this is due to the impact parameter mixing and to the contribution of intermediate impact parameters .",
    "in fact , as one can see on fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].a , at 39 mev / nucleon the total multiplicity exhibits a rather flat behavior with b. clearly , for mid - central collisions , the reaction dynamics becomes more transparent , leading to a reduction of @xmath67 .",
    "the impact parameter mixing is less pronounced at beam energies larger than 39 mev / nucleon , where the total multiplicity decreases significantly with b. this leads to the small increase observed for @xmath67 on fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].c . in the low beam energy region ,",
    "the results overestimate the data due to the overestimation of mean - field dissipation . in the high beam energy region , where complete multifragmentation is achieved ,",
    "smf events reproduce well the experimental data , with values between 0.5 and 0.7 .",
    "we also observe a systematic small underestimation of the mean values of @xmath67 in the calculations , with respect to the experimental data .",
    "as there is a difference in the definition of @xmath68 in this work ( where pre - equilibrium particles are excluded ) and in  @xcite , we have checked if similar events are actually selected in the data and in the calculations .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : distrizmtotcut ] a comparison of charge distributions for beam energies above 39 mev / nucleon .",
    "one can see that a rather good agreement is obtained .",
    "the absence of heavy fragment production in the calculations is due to the lack statistics .",
    "the overestimation of fragment production in the z range [ 10;30 ] , at 39 and 45 mev / nucleon , is a consequence of the @xmath68 criterium .",
    "being pre - equilibrium particles excluded in the theoretical analysis , the corresponding @xmath68 ranges are compressed by about 30% with respect to the experimental ones . this induces a loss of sensitivity in the selection and larger impact parameters may be kept in the selected calculated events , with respect to the data .",
    "the latter contribute to the charge distribution mainly by fission of the quasi - projectile , leading to fragment production in the z range [ 10;30 ] and to a small decrease of the @xmath67 value .",
    "nevertheless , in the high beam energy region , the @xmath68 selection gives similar sets of events in the calculations and in the data ( see the right panel of fig.7 ) and general trends are not affected by the difference in the definition of @xmath68 .",
    "looking at the fig .",
    "[ fig : stopping].c ( violet line ) , the simulation results appear shifted to the right , with respect to the data .",
    "a similar shift has been observed for the multifragmentation threshold .",
    "in fact , the results obtained for @xmath73 in the simulations ( a decrease followed by a mild increase ) can be associated with the transition from statistical sequential decay of equilibrated sources , dominating at the lowest energies over the whole range of considered impact parameters , to full multifragmentation of central collisions , observed at the highest beam energies .",
    "the same mechanism could be present in the data , but with a lower `` transition '' beam energy ( around 20 mev / nucleon ) .    finally , we stress that , according to our simulations , the behavior obtained for @xmath73 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : stopping].c , violet line ) comes essentially from the fact that the event selection based on the @xmath68 cut - off induces some impact parameter mixing .",
    "indeed , looking at the results corresponding to b=0.5 fm , we observe full stopping in central collisions at fermi energies , in the beam energy range considered .",
    "this indicates that a full stopping scenario could be compatible with the experimental results , though it can not be taken as a conclusive proof of the reaction dynamics .",
    "thus the centrality selection in experimental data has to be carefully considered before proper conclusions can be drawn .",
    "the issue of the link between the compression - expansion cycle , the collective radial expansion and the multifragmentation pattern observed in central collisions at fermi energies has been addressed comparing the predictions of the semi - classical smf transport model to indra multifragmentation data .",
    "the simulations allow one to extract the maximum radial expansion energy reached in reactions at beam energies in the fermi domain .",
    "this can be used as a reference in flow estimation analyses based on statistical models .",
    "looking at the time evolution of fragment formation , we show that for all considered energies above 32 mev / nucleon , density fluctuations occur and lead to pre - fragment formation already at t=100 fm / c .",
    "these nascent partitions have then different stories depending on the strength of the velocity fields . for energies below 39 mev / nucleon , the nascent partitions do not survive , leading to evaporation residue or fission fragments in the exit channel , while for higher energies , one observes multifragmentation events . looking at the properties of these events , we obtain a good reproduction of data as far as the charge partitions are concerned . concerning kinematical properties , we observe and quantify the underestimation of velocities which suggests a weakening of initial radial expansion along the fragment formation process , due to the lack of thermal pressure effects , which is a typical drawback of semi - classical models .",
    "we have also investigated the issue of stopping power in nuclear reactions and performed the same analysis proposed in  @xcite .",
    "we observe that for very central collisions , b=0.5 fm full stopping is achieved at all energies .",
    "however , if a selection of centrality is done as in the experimental data , we recover the experimental results , which exhibit a lesser degree of stopping .",
    "we then pointed out the essential coherence needed in the comparison between data and microscopic simulations in order to give unbiased indications on the microscopic ingredients of the considered models . within our approach a good reproduction of the experimental data , at beam energies above the multifragmentation threshold ,",
    "is obtained by employing the free ( angle and energy dependent ) nn cross section and a soft eos ( compressibility k = 200 mev ) .    following the definition given in experimental studies",
    ", we find that the evolution of the @xmath73 ratio with the beam energy can be associated with a change in the fragmentation mechanim , from statistical decay to prompt multifragmentation . at the highest beam energies central events , where large fragment multiplicities are observed , start to dominate the selection experimentally considered ( based on particle multiplicity cuts ) , thus leading to the small increase observed for the stopping power .",
    "the simulation results appear shifted with respect to the experimental data , in analogy with the shift to higher energies observed , in the model , for the multifragmentation threshold .",
    "we conclude by mentioning that , in the framework of mean - fields approaches , new methods to improve the treatment of fluctuations , in the isovector channel @xcite and in full phase space @xcite , have recently been introduced .",
    "a more effective fluctuating term is expected to lead to a faster fragmentation process , thus lowering the fragmentation threshold and enhancing fragment velocities .",
    "further studies , based on the comparison with experimental data , are in progress .",

    "they also thank m.f .",
