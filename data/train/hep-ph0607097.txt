    "the hierarchy problem in particle physics is concerned with the question of why gravity is so weak compared with the other forces in nature , or posed another way , why the scale for gravity , i.e. the planck mass at @xmath1 gev , is so much larger than the scales for the other forces in nature , the strong force with a lund string model scale of @xmath2 gev / fm and the electro - weak force characterized by the mass of the w and z bosons , @xmath3 gev .",
    "several solutions have been proposed to solve this problem , such as 1 ) supersymmetry in which bosons and fermions are symmetric and which unifies the strong and electro - weak forces at a scale just below the planck scale , 2 ) string theory in which elementary particles are represented by higher dimensional strings , e.g. 11 dimensional , and which is a theory of quantum gravity thought to be valid up to the planck scale and beyond , and 3 ) the concept of large extra dimensions ( led ) which also assumes space - time has a higher dimensionality than the normal @xmath4 dimensions@xcite .",
    "the present study will be carried out in the framework of the led model of arkani - hamed , dimopoulos , and dvali@xcite , called the add model , so some further discussion of the model is given .",
    "this model has produced a great deal of interest in the literature , and there exist many papers that discuss it and its consequences , several of which are referenced here@xcite .",
    "the four main assumptions of the add model are : 1 ) space - time is higher dimensional , so introduce @xmath5 extra spacial dimensions beyond our usual three such that space - time is @xmath6 dimensional , 2 ) only allow gravity , i.e. gravitons , to propagate in all @xmath6 dimensions , 3 ) assume the extra dimensions are `` compact '' , i.e. finite , so they are too small to be normally detected but large enough to impact physics , and 4 ) assume that standard model particles , e.g. quarks , gluons , photons , etc ... , are confined to a @xmath4 dimensional `` wall '' or `` brane '' representing our normal world embedded in the higher dimensional space .",
    "the mechanism used in the add model to solve the hierarchy problem is to define that it does nt exist : the reason gravity looks so weak in our @xmath4 dimensional world is that its force is diluted by existing in @xmath6 dimensions , so the higher dimensional `` true '' planck mass , @xmath7 , is much lower than the `` apparent '' planck mass we measure in our world .",
    "as will be shown below , by adjusting the number of extra dimensions and their size , the higher dimensional planck mass can be brought down to a level low enough , i.e. @xmath2 tev , to eliminate the hierarchy problem .",
    "in addition to resolving the hierarchy problem , the add model leads to consequences which may be observed in nature .",
    "one of these is due to the compactification of the extra dimensions resulting in `` towers '' of new `` particle - in - a - box '' energy states called kaluza - klein states ( named after the researchers who in the 1930 s made an unsuccessful attempt to unify gravity with the electromagnetic force using extra dimensions)@xcite .",
    "kaluza - klein states can be associated with a spectrum of graviton states which could influence hard scattering processes at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) and could be dark matter candidates@xcite . another exciting consequence of the add model is that miniature black holes could exist at the greatly reduced planck mass of around 1 tev and thus might be produced in tev - scale particle collisions , such as at the lhc@xcite . of course",
    ", in order for the add model to be a viable solution to the hierarchy problem , none of its consequences are allowed to conflict with existing observations .",
    "it can be shown that for @xmath8 and @xmath9 tev , the add model does not conflict with existing astrophysical observations , cosmology , or particle accelerator experiments@xcite ( some of these arguments will be presented later in this note ) .",
    "a very interesting feature of the add model is that it can be shown to be consistent with type i string theory@xcite , which is characterized by extra dimensions , open ended strings ( sm particles ) stuck to a @xmath4 dimensional brane , and closed strings ( gravitons ) which can move freely in the extra dimensions . because of this , detection of unique signatures predicted by the add model would be a strong suggestion of the validity of string theory and thus we might be able to experimentally study string theory effects at the 1 tev scale@xcite !    in this spirit , the main goal of the present work is to study the possibility of detecting unique signatures of miniature black holes which may be created in lhc @xmath0 collisions .",
    "an estimate for @xmath10 collisions is also made at the end .",
    "more specifically , quantitative calculations will be carried out for mini - bh production at the lhc using a code based on the add model , charybdis@xcite , and comparisons of charged hadron production from mini - bh decay will be made with charged hadron production from the pythia qcd code@xcite in a particle tracking detector whose acceptance is around mid - rapidity such as in the alice experiment@xcite . since the concepts of large extra dimensions and black holes are less familiar than other aspects of lhc physics , the interested reader can find some qualitative discussions of these concepts elsewhere@xcite .",
    "this section describes quantitative calculations for bh production and detection using a hadronic detector system with the performance and acceptance characteristics of in the lhc alice experiment .",
    "unless otherwise noted , results presented refer to lhc @xmath0 collisions .",
    "similar studies have been carried out by others for the lhc atlas experiment@xcite . in the present study",
    "the bh event generator code charybdis@xcite is used .",
    "charybdis represents a quantitative treatment of bh formation and decay for @xmath0 collisions .",
    "three of its main features are 1 ) it integrates over parton distribution functions , 2 ) it calculates bh decay incorporating `` grey body '' factors , and 3 ) it is coupled to the pythia qcd code@xcite for parton evolution and hadronization .",
    "parton distribution functions used in this study are the same as used by dimopoulos and landsberg@xcite .",
    "figure 1 shows the production cross section and number of bhs produced in a one - year running period at the lhc for @xmath0 at a luminosity of @xmath11 @xmath12s@xmath13 , and similar numbers for run i at the tevatron , as a function of the planck mass from charybdis+pythia .",
    "as seen , at full luminosity at the lhc for one year there are about @xmath14 bhs produced if the planck mass is 1 tev , exponentially decreasing to only 1 bh being produced in a year for 10 tev . for the tevatron",
    ", it is seen that only a few bhs are expected to have been produced during run i if the planck mass were exactly at 1 tev , dropping to less than one bh for 1.1 tev .",
    "thus , it is not suprising that no evidence of bh formation has been reported so far at the tevatron .",
    "figure 2 shows a comparison between transverse momentum distributions for charged hadrons at mid - rapidity at full lhc energy from charybdis+pythia for two values of @xmath7 with that from pythia alone , labeled `` qcd only '' ( this plot is patched together from various pythia runs with increasing values for the hardness of the @xmath15 parton collision , each run represented by a different color ) . as seen for @xmath16 tev , hadrons from bh decays dominate over qcd processes for @xmath17 gev / c , whereas for @xmath18 tev , bh decays only become important for @xmath19 tev .",
    "since the alice experiment does not presently forsee having large - acceptance calomimetry capable of accurate particle @xmath20 measurements to very high values , alternative observables which are sensitive to the possibility of @xmath21 tev are needed .",
    "taking advantage of the large - acceptance precision tracking detectors available in alice , namely the combined inner tracking system ( its ) , time projection chamber ( tpc ) and transition radiation detector ( trd ) tracking , two event - by - event observables look promising for bh studies : charged multiplicity and summed @xmath20 .",
    "the particle acceptance for charged multiplicity in rapidity and @xmath20 is represented by @xmath22 and @xmath23 gev / c , respectively . a reasonable acceptance which can be taken for summed @xmath20 per event is represented by @xmath24 and @xmath25 gev / c .",
    "these observables will be studied below .",
    "the strategy of the present study will be the following : a ) compare charged hadron production from bhs using charybdis+pythia with qcd high-@xmath20 processes from pythia alone , b ) detect these hadrons in the alice its+tpc+trd tracking acceptance with momentum resolution effects included and c ) try to find a simple triggering scheme to use for this . for all of the plots shown below for the alice study , the lhc will be assumed to give @xmath26 tev @xmath0 collisions at a `` year-1 '' luminosity of @xmath27 @xmath12s@xmath13 .",
    "a value for the number of extra dimensions will be taken to be @xmath28 .",
    "note that for a given @xmath7 the results from charybdis do not depend sensitively on the exact value of @xmath5 used for values of this order , e.g. for @xmath29 the bh production cross section is within 10% of the @xmath28 case .",
    "the charged hadrons included in all plots are pions , kaons , protons , and their anti - particles .",
    "the alice tracking acceptance is simulated with rapidity and transverse momentum cuts , and momentum resolution effects are conservatively simulated assuming @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the particle momentum .",
    "figures 3 and 4 show plots of charged hadron multiplicity per event and summed @xmath20 per event , respectively , for bh and qcd events in the alice acceptances for running a minimum - bias trigger for four months of initial lhc luminosity . the maximum data acquisition rate for @xmath0 in alice",
    "is taken to be 100 hz .",
    "for these running conditions , it is seen that only a few bh events will be visible above the qcd background and only for @xmath16 tev , occuring for multiplicities greater than 200 and summed @xmath20 greater than 0.5 tev / c .    in order to improve this situation ,",
    "assume it is possible to apply a simple charged multiplicity trigger to alice events in the tracking acceptance @xmath24 where only events with multiplicity greater than 65 are accepted .",
    "possible detectors which could be used to implement such a trigger are the trd and its , but further study of the details of this is required .",
    "figures 5 and 6 show plots corresponding to figures 3 and 4 above except with this multiplicity trigger .",
    "the data rate for this trigger for the lhc luminosity used is only 1 hz , which is 1% of the maximum data acquisition rate for alice @xmath0 data and which would thus have only a small impact on the overall data - taking rate for alice . as expected , this trigger is seen to greatly reduce the qcd background allowing for significant bh signals to be detected during this short running period . for charged multiplicity , the sensitivity to @xmath7",
    "is raised to 2 tev and hundreds of bh events above background corresponding to this case are seen for multiplicities greater than 250 .",
    "the situation is seen to be even better for summed @xmath20 , where tens of thousands of bh events are seen above background for the @xmath16 tev case , and tens of bh events may be seen above background even for the @xmath18 tev case in this running period .",
    "the signature for bh creation from these simple observables is seen to be an abrupt flattening of the slope of either distribution as the transition from pure qcd to bh dominated charged particle production takes place . for @xmath32 tev",
    ", this flattening should be seen in both distributions in alice giving a redundancy to this signature . the point in multiplicity and/or summed @xmath20 where the flattening occurs",
    "would be related to the value of @xmath7 which in principle could then be determined .",
    "it is also interesting to look at other hadronic observables which might be used as signatures for bh production and could be correlated with signals seen in the multiplicity and summed @xmath20 observables discussed above .",
    "one of these is the disappearance / suppression of high @xmath20 di - jets if bhs are produced@xcite . since bhs",
    "are thought to decay more or less isotropically by sequential standard model particle emissions , one would expect to observe an enhancement of mono - jets over the usual back - to - back di - jet production seen in @xmath0 collisions .",
    "one way to study this is to look at @xmath33 hadronic distributions , where @xmath34 is the difference in azymuthal coordinate between two hadrons in a given event . for the usual back - to - back di - jet production one",
    "expects peaks in this distribution at @xmath34 of 0 and @xmath35 , whereas for mono - jets one would only see a peak at 0 .",
    "figure 7 shows a preliminary study of @xmath33 in the alice acceptance comparing bh events ( charybdis ) and qcd events ( pythia ) for several different kinematical regions .",
    "a suppression of the backward peak is observed for the bh events and is seen to depend on the kinematical region used .",
    "another possible signature is the direct detection of bh relics which are bhs left over at the end of the hawking decay of mass near the higher - dimensional planck mass ( @xmath36 tev ) which may be stable@xcite .",
    "a preliminary study of the ability of alice to detect charged bh relics of 2 tev mass is shown in figure 8 .",
    "the charged bh relic formation was simulated using a modified version of the charbydis code@xcite .",
    "acceptance , momentum resolution and tof resolution effects are included in this study .",
    "as seen , a 2 tev charged relic is easily observed in the alice detector .",
    "the final topic which will be discussed is the ability to produce / detect bhs in lhc @xmath10 running , which will take place with lower energy , luminosity , and runtime per year compared with @xmath0 . as a lower - limit estimate ,",
    "assume that a @xmath10 collision can be represented as a superposition of free @xmath0 collisions with high @xmath20 @xmath15 qcd processes . under this assumption pythia and charybdis can be used .",
    "calculate the effective @xmath0 luminosity , @xmath37 , from the expected @xmath10 luminosity of @xmath38 @xmath12s@xmath13 , assuming 5% centrality collisions .",
    "coincidentally , it is found that @xmath39 @xmath12s@xmath13 , the same luminosity taken in the above for alice p+p running ! figure 9 shows the summed @xmath20 distribution for charged hadrons simulated in this way for @xmath10 collisions as detected in the alice acceptance .",
    "only hadrons produced with @xmath40 gev / c are included in order to minimize the background from soft processes which dominate the heavy - ion collision .",
    "as seen , for four months of @xmath10 running ( which represents four _ years _ of lhc running since @xmath10 will only be run one month per year ) the case for @xmath16 tev can easily be detected above the qcd background , whereas for @xmath41 tev detection is already becoming problematic .",
    "models with large extra dimensions have exciting consequences including the possible creation of mini - bhs at the lhc . under the proper conditions experiments such as the alice experiment",
    "have the capability to detect bhs from charged hadronic observables for higher - dimensional planck masses ranging from 1 to 5 tev within the first four months of lhc running . a simple method for triggering on charged particle multiplicity to enhance the bh signal",
    "is suggested .",
    "the authors are grateful to chris harris for his help in running his code charybdis .",
