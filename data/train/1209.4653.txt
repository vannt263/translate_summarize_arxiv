    "all of the model fits to the data presented in this paper were carried out using diskfit , a newly - released , publicly - availablespekkens / diskfit/ ] code that fits non - parametric models to either images or velocity fields . while diskfit  will fit axisymmetric models ,",
    "its main purpose is to fit non - axisymmetric models either to images or to velocity fields of disc galaxies , as originally described by @xcite for images and by both @xcite and @xcite for velocity fields .",
    "diskfit  supercedes the velfitspekkens / velfit/ ] code to model velocity fields , and it represents the first public release of the non - parametric image decomposition technique described in @xcite .",
    "both the photometric and kinematic branches of diskfit  employ the same basic minimization technique , originally described by @xcite .",
    "several new features have been added to the algorithm since the original publications : for example , diskfit  can now fit for a symmetric outer velocity field warp , correct for minor distortions due to seeing , handle fits  or text file velocity field inputs , and sparsely sample input fits  files .",
    "as described in detail in previous publications @xcite , diskfit  has several advantages over traditional approaches for extracting the kinematic or photometric structure of a disc galaxy .",
    "the kinematic branch of the code , velfit , differs fundamentally from the frequently - used rotcur @xcite  tilted ring \" algorithm since it fits a specific , physically motivated model rather than parametrizing concentric rings of the velocity field . by the same token ,",
    "the photometric branch of the code differs fundamentally from popular algorithms such as galfit @xcite in that it fits non - parametric disc and bar light profiles rather than specified functional forms .",
    "diskfit  therefore enables the user to model both kinematic and photometric data for nearby galaxies with as few assumptions about the parameters of the disc and bar as can reasonably be made .",
    "because the underlying algorithm is the same for both the kinematic and photometric branches of the code , diskfit  is a particularly powerful tool for understanding the physical structure of galaxies for which both types of data are available .",
    "diskfit  excels at finding relatively weak , coherent asymmetries : it provides a robust estimate of the underlying disc properties in their presence , and quantitative upper limits in their absence .",
    "it is also superior to other algorithms in that it is capable of providing statistically valid , and realistic , estimates of the uncertainties on the returned parameters using bootstrap realizations of the best - fitting model to the data .",

    "unlike tilted - ring techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the disc is assumed flat out to warp radius @xmath28 , beyond which both the ellipticity and the position angle of the line of nodes vary in proportion to @xmath29 .",
    "diskfit  can find the best fitting inner warp radius @xmath28 and peak change in ellipticity and position angle of the line of nodes , or it can hold any combination of these parameters fixed .",
    "the photometric models applied by diskfit  are identical to those described by @xcite .",
    "diskfit  fits photometric images with up to 3 components : a disc , bar and bulge .",
    "diskfit  assumes a flat , intrinsically round disc and a linear bar with a different apparent ( projected ) ellipticity and position angle in the plane of the disc .",

    "the sharp line along the minor axis in the residual map is an artefact introduced during the modified envelope tracing ( see section  [ hidata ] ) .",
    "we also use diskfit  to search for a symmetric warp in the hi  disc , and find no evidence for one : specifically , we find a 3@xmath3 upper limit on the maximum change in position angle at @xmath59 to be @xmath60 , while that on the disc ellipticity is @xmath61 . the gradual decline in the hi  rotation curve for @xmath62",
    "is therefore not caused by a warp .",
    "as in the models of @xcite , our best - fitting rotation - only hi  model underestimates the projected velocity in the outermost regions in the south / southwest quadrant ( bottom right ) of the disc by @xmath63 ( see fig .  [ rotmodelvfs ] ) .",
    "the position - velocity diagrams of @xcite suggest that this feature is a local warp in the disc .",
    "that diskfit  does not recover this feature as a warp is not surprising given its lack of symmetry and relatively small spatial extent ."
