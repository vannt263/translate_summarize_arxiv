    "the physics of wetting by quantum fluids , particularly @xmath1he , @xmath0he and isotopic mixtures , received considerable attention from both experimentalists and theoreticians along the last decade , with experiments mostly pointing at measuring adsorption isotherms , determining the interfacial surface tensions , establishing the wetting temperature and constructing phase diagrams for the mixed systems .",
    "a geometrical , visible parameter that characterizes the wetting behavior of a liquid - substrate combination at temperature t is the contact angle of a macroscopic drop or wedge on a planar surface .",
    "the contact angle of liquid @xmath1he on cs has been measured by at least three different groups,@xcite and although the reported values do not coincide -a result which among other effects , could be attributed to the preparation of the surface- they are fully consistent with the helium inability to wet this weak adsorber .",
    "@xcite by contrast , @xmath0he has been theoretically shown to be a universal wetting agent@xcite , a prediction which was verified shortly after , as isotherms of @xmath0he on cs were measured that display neat prewetting jumps down to temperatures around 0.2 k.@xcite    it is well - known that @xmath0he atoms admixed into bulk liquid @xmath1he or @xmath1he films at low t s populate a twodimensional ( 2d ) homogeneous layer of andreev states on the free surface@xcite ( see also ref . and refs . therein for a recent review ) .",
    "in this case , the andreev state originates in the presence of a broad surface at the @xmath1he liquid - vapor interface and in the mutual interaction between the isotopes , and corresponds to the ground state ( gs ) of a discrete spectrum of states which become progressively localized towards the interior of the film .",
    "this structure appears as well in density profiles of mixed clusters.@xcite it was earlier proposed@xcite that if @xmath1he lies on a weak adsorber , andreev - like states could be expected at the liquid - substrate interface .",
    "theoretical anticipations of the wetting behavior of mixtures rely heavily on the expected reduction of the liquid - vapor surface tension of the mixture with respect to that of pure @xmath1he , due to the fermi pressure of the andreev surface layer.@xcite this effect , actually observed in ref . , reduces the contact angle at a given temperature , thus permitting lower wetting temperatures as the @xmath0he concentration increases . on these grounds , pettersen and saam@xcite predicted reentrant wetting of helium mixtures on cs , a phenomenon measured shortly after by ketola _",
    "et al_.@xcite the complete phase diagram for wetting of helium mixtures on alkali metal substrates derived in ref . offers a wide gallery of phenomena which includes prewetting , isotopic separation , triple point dewetting and @xmath6-transitions in the solution , in the full range of @xmath0he concentrations .",
    "subsequent experimental work discovered a rich pattern of wetting by mixtures , which includes , i.e. , dewetting transitions near coexistence.@xcite more recently , detailed measurements of the contact angle for dilute helium mixtures have been reported;@xcite an analysis of the data showed that the large values of these angles are consistent with the presence of single - particle ( sp ) states of the @xmath0he atoms , together with ripplons , at the liquid - solid interface .    the first calculation of density profiles of finite droplets of @xmath1he on cs , at zero temperature , was forwarded by ancilotto _",

    "more recently , we have presented calculations of nanoscale mixed @xmath0he-@xmath1he droplets on cs,@xcite ( hereafter , referred to as i ) using a previously derived frdf for mixtures.@xcite an important prediction in this paper is the existence of edge states , the lowest - lying @xmath0he sp bound states , which are essentially onedimensional ( 1d ) and localize around the contact line of the @xmath1he drop -in contrast to the 2d surface andreev states .",

    "this is due to the fact that the wf s @xmath57 lie close enough to the @xmath27 axis to experience centrifugal distortion at any nonvanishing @xmath26 .",

    "the rotational character of the gs band @xmath58 if @xmath69 100 , allows one to fit these sp energies to a law    @xmath70    with @xmath71 = -4.52 k and regression unity . from @xmath72 = 1.18 @xmath73",

    "the fact that @xmath1he drops on na and li only support one bound @xmath49 state , namely that surrounding the contact line , together with the rather weak @xmath26 dependence of the sp energies in the @xmath56 rotational band for large @xmath7 , makes the @xmath0he@xmath4 rings hosted by these droplets , physical realizations of a neutral luttinger liquid.@xcite    figure [ fig6 ] shows the energy @xmath81 of the edge state , as a function of @xmath7 for cs , k , na , and li substrates , with @xmath82 .",

    "this yields @xmath87 for k , @xmath88 for na , and @xmath89 for li .",
    "we have obtained the structure of films in the vicinity of @xmath86 , working out the first three @xmath0he sp states as illustrated in figs .",

    "[ fig7 ] , the wave functions follow the trend anticipated in ref . :",
    "the gs of a @xmath0he impurity in a @xmath1he film remains mostly concentrated inside the li monolayer , and is localized at the liquid - vapor interface if the film thickness is above one layer ( k and na ) .",
    "the energetics of the impurity shows an interesting evolution across the prewetting transition . in the case of k , the weakest adsorber of this series , for the range of @xmath93 values here considered , the film spectrum is essentially constant with coverage , and for all three adsorbers the first _ excited _ state appears above the gs of the @xmath0he atom on the substrate . in contradistinction , at the prewetting density @xmath86 the energy of the andreev state is _ below _",
    "@xmath43 for k , and _ above _ it for na and li .",
    "we appreciate then that an important finite size effect for @xmath1he clusters on these later two adsorbers is the generation of the edge state for the @xmath0he impurity , which is favored with respect to binding to the substrate , thus permitting the existence of _ mixed _ drops of both helium isotopes on these adsorbers . it may also be inferred from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the different behaviour of adsorbers like k and weaker , as compared to na adsorbers and stronger .",
    "whereas in the former case , after filling the edge - like states , @xmath0he atoms start populating andreev - like states covering the cup of the @xmath1he droplet , in the latter , once the edge - like states are filled , @xmath0he spreads on the alkali surface .",
    "we now solve the coupled el / ks equations ( [ eq4 ] ) and ( [ eq5 ] ) for @xmath7 = 20 and 100 , and for several @xmath5 values , on a cs substrate . fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] displays the variation of the lowest ks sp energies @xmath42 as functions of @xmath5 for the case @xmath7 = 20 , with heavy dots indicating the fermi energy / chemical potential @xmath94 of the given configuration . as seen in this figure ,",
    "the chemical potential @xmath94 is a -nonmonotonically- increasing function of the system size .",
    "this trend coincides with that encountered in @xmath0he , either pure@xcite or dissolved in thick @xmath1he films.@xcite figure [ fig9 ] also shows that for @xmath7=20 , values of @xmath95 , 10 , 16 , and 30 yield strong shell closures , and they are thus the magic numbers for the fermion component of a @xmath1he@xmath96+@xmath0he@xmath4 droplet on cs -these numbers depend on the alkali substrate and on @xmath7- .",
    "weaker shell closures also appear for @xmath97 , 20 , 24 , 34 , and 38 .",

    "[ fig10 ] for @xmath45 , and in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] for @xmath99 , and two values of @xmath5 .",
    "as we analyze these patterns , several observations may be put forward . on the one hand , we verify the spreading tendency of the density profiles @xmath100 with growing @xmath5 , as well as a tendency to cover the horizontal base and show some slight dilution inside the bulk of the host .",
    "it is also apparent from these figures that @xmath0he atoms in andreev surface states do coat the @xmath1he cap . on the other hand ,",
    "the shape of the @xmath1he droplet is rather insensitive to the presence of the intruder atoms , whose outwards spreading does not induce splashing of the @xmath1he cluster on the substrate surface as well .    the behavior of the @xmath0he density should be interpreted together with examination of the ks level scheme in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] : an energetically based criterion for spreading of mixtures of @xmath101 atoms on any substrate is given by the constraint @xmath102 , which defines a critical size @xmath103 above which it is energetically more convenient , for an extra @xmath0he atom , to adhere to the flat substrate than to the @xmath1he drop .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , for @xmath7=20 , @xmath104 is about 44 .",
    "finally , a word of caution should be spoken with respect to the contact angle , for whose determination in large , macroscopic droplets , a procedure has been developed in ref . .",
    "as discussed in i , due to the fact that nanoscopic @xmath1he droplet densities present large stratification near the substrate , the contact angle can not be established by ` visual inspection ' of the equidensity lines . yet , even at a qualitative level of description , it is clear from the results here presented that addition of @xmath0he atoms affects the contact angle . to illustrate this assertion further , in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we show the contour plot of the total @xmath1he+@xmath0he density for @xmath1he equidensity lines about 0.011 @xmath105 , roughly half the bulk @xmath1he density , for @xmath45 and 100 and several @xmath5 values .",
    "although the small size of these droplets prevents us from drawing quantitative conclusions , this figure indicates that the height of the cap changes less than the radius of its base , thus suggesting overall flattening of the combined density and a decrease of the contact angle , as expected according to both theory and experiment carried upon macroscopic samples .",
    "in our previous work here denoted as i , we have shown that in addition to the well known andreev states , nanoscopic @xmath1he drops on cs substrates host a new class of @xmath0he sp states , edge states that generate a 1d ring of @xmath0he atoms along the contact line . in this work",
    "we have carried a deeper investigation of size effects in mixed droplets on planar alkali surfacess , that enables us to assert that these edge states are a definite consequence of the particular combination of the confinement provoked by the adsorbing field , selfsaturation of the helium system and mutual interaction between isotopes .",
    "in fact , these localized states appear in all alkali substrates and for all @xmath1he clusters , although their 1d nature becomes more evident either above nanoscopic host sizes or for the strongest confining potentials .",
    "we are able to compare the energy spectrum of single @xmath0he impurities in @xmath1he clusters with similar spectra on films , and found that while the evolution of the lowest lying sp states with film coverage near the prewetting transition may prevent solvation of a @xmath0he atom in a film on a strong adsorber such as na or li , its gs energy being unfavorable compared with binding to the substrate , the breaking of translational symmetry introduced by the finite size of clusters does change this trend , giving rise to an energetically favored edge state which remains localized around the drop .",
    "we also show that increasing @xmath106 ratios enlarge the tendency of the mixed cluster to spread outwards on the surface ; explicit ks calculations of the energy spectrum of added @xmath0he atoms and examination of the fermi energy as a function of @xmath5 support the quantummechanical interpretation for the onset of wetting by mixtures of helium fluids , as driven by the energetic benefit of abandoning the @xmath1he and adhering instead to the substrate .",
