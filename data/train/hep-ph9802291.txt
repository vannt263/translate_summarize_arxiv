    "the dynamical mechanism of resonant enhancement constitutes an explicit violation of the quark - hadron duality assumption and could influence power counting rules built into the hqet estimate of @xmath3  @xcite , which assumes a large energy gap between @xmath8 and the scale @xmath9 at which hadron dynamics is active .",
    "in addition , if a resonance is viewed as a single - particle intermediate state , then its contribution will be favored over that of multibody intermediate states by the @xmath10 counting rules .    for the remainder of this section",
    ", we continue the discussion of resonance contributions to mixing amplitudes .",

    "( [ mixmatr ] ) corresponds to the contribution of local @xmath15 box and dipenguin operators .",
    "these are small in the standard model  @xcite .",
    "next come the bilocal contributions which are induced by the insertion of two @xmath16 operators .",
    "this class of terms might be enhanced by various nonperturbative effects , and therefore is of considerable interest . as follows from eq .",

    "( [ mixmatr ] ) takes the form of an integral over the energy variable .",
    "there will be a unitarity cut in the complex energy plane lying along the real axis and beginning at the two - pion threshold .",
    "the contribution from charged pseudoscalar two - body intermediate states was originally considered in refs .",
    "@xcite and estimated to be potentially large .",
    "however , it remains very difficult to reliably determine the total effect associated with @xmath18 intermediate states due to the many decay modes present , each having unknown final state interaction ( fsi ) phases .",
    "for a recent attempt in this direction , see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there are also the ` single - particle ' effects arising both from bound states and from resonance intermediate states .",
    "a bound state contribution occurs as a pole on the real-@xmath19 axis .",
    "a resonance contribution lies in the continuum and corresponds to a pole on an unphysical riemann sheet .",
    "its contribution will be a sharply peaked lorentzian profile of the discontinuity across the unitarity cut , much like that of a bound state .",
    "however , a resonance will contribute both to @xmath3 and @xmath20 . in principle , single - particle effects are rather simpler to analyze .",
    "the number of such intermediate states is constrained , and they can generally be estimated , at least roughly .",
    "as mentioned above the @xmath10-counting rules , shown already to work reasonably well for the estimates of @xmath6-meson decay widths , favor a set of single - particle intermediate states , _",
    "i.e. _ pole diagrams ( _ cf _ fig .",
    "1 ) for self - energies of @xmath21 .",
    "the light - meson and @xmath22-flavored meson single - particle contributions to @xmath0 mixing have already been analyzed  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the resonance sector .",
    "consider the special role of resonances .",
    "to begin , we express the collection of such contributions to @xmath3 ( upon neglecting cp - violation ) as @xmath23 the pseudoscalar @xmath24 ( scalar @xmath25 ) intermediate states have @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) and contribute to the @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) part of the above .",
    "if the mass of the resonance is not too far from the @xmath6-meson mass , an interesting effect occurs . to highlight the dependence on the resonance mass ,",
    "temporarily consider just the energy denominator in eq .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) .",
    "the contribution to the energy denominator of a light bound state ( _ e.g. _ pions or kaons ) of mass @xmath30 is @xmath31 , which amounts to a suppression factor of order @xmath32 .",
    "by contrast , the energy denominator ( _ cf _ eq .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) ) for a resonance of mass @xmath33 and width @xmath34 will yield @xmath35 in the limit of a narrow resonance width , the expression for @xmath4 becomes proportional to the delta function @xmath36 , as expected .",
    "the effect of a finite width is to allow the resonance to contribute at values @xmath37 .",
    "the contribution to @xmath3 vanishes at @xmath38 since it undergoes a change of sign there .",
    "considered as a function of the resonance mass @xmath33 , the maximum effect occurs for @xmath39 at which @xmath40 . on the other hand",
    ", the resonance contribution to @xmath4 is maximized at the different value @xmath38 , but is still substantial at the values @xmath39 which maximize the contribution to @xmath3 . in particular , for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 , the @xmath32 dependence which would appear for a very light resonance has been replaced by @xmath41 .",
    "thus , for a resonance sufficiently near the @xmath6 meson the possibility exists for an enhancement factor of order @xmath42 for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 relative to an unenhanced pole contribution .",
    "actually it even makes sense to broaden the term ` nearby resonance ' to include @xmath43  gev since the @xmath32 suppression mentioned above will be largely overcome .    also present in eq .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) are the @xmath6-to-@xmath44 transition amplitudes . to obtain a quantitative description ,",

    "( [ hbsw ] ) is to be evaluated in vacuum saturation . in vacuum saturation",
    ", the contribution of resonance @xmath44 to mixing will be proportional to the squared decay constant @xmath47 .",
    "this has two important consequences :    1 .",
    "@xmath1 resonances having @xmath48 will not contribute , as they occur in p - waves and thus have vanishing wave function at the origin .",
    "although they could well be nonzero in a more general setting , their absence here suggests they would be suppressed .",
    "we interpret @xmath49 @xmath1 resonances with masses nearest the @xmath6 as second radial excitations .",
    "we include also _ first _ radial excitations in our study due to their larger decay constants but omit radial excitations above the second .",
    "the fact that the most recent particle data group compilation  @xcite cites many nonstrange and strange resonances in the mass region up to @xmath50  mev strongly supports the premise of a resonance mechanism . since",
    "experimental data are still relatively sparse in the mass region of the @xmath6 system , however , additional spectroscopic knowledge of this energy range is needed .    in the following",
    ", we shall consider the effects of individual @xmath51 or @xmath52 composites .",
    "although individual contributions like these will , at least to some extent , be subject to gim cancellations as other states are added in , such contributions nonetheless serve as useful indicators of what mixing signal to be reasonably expected .",
    "we employ eq .",
    "( [ hbsw ] ) for the @xmath53 examples , while employing a largely phenomenological method for the @xmath51 case .    * @xmath52 resonance *    the mixing amplitudes induced by resonance @xmath44 are @xmath54 where @xmath55 , the dimensionless quantities @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the reduced squared - mass and width of the resonance , and from the unitarity of ckm matrix and neglecting @xmath58 we have used @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "since decay widths @xmath61  gev are characteristic of resonances in the @xmath62  gev mass range , one expects that @xmath63 in applications of eq .",

    "we note that the two mass values @xmath64 maximize the resonance contribution to @xmath0 mixing for fixed decay width and decay constant values . as to the dependence in eq .",
    "( [ delmg ] ) on the resonance decay constant one recalls @xmath65 , @xmath66 for the noncharm ground state and @xmath67 , @xmath68  @xcite for the charm ground state .",
    "excitations of the constituent quarks will reduce the wave function at the origin and thus decrease the corresponding decay constant . for @xmath52 radial excitations",
    ", we use hydrogen atom wave functions to provide a rough guide in estimating default values of @xmath69 . for first radial excitations ,",
    "we estimate @xmath70  gev whereas for second radial excitations , we use @xmath71  gev in our numerical work .",
    "we expect contributions from even higher radial excitations to be negligible . in our numerical work results",
    "are scaled with the square of the associated decay constant to allow for any future departures in assumed values or quantum number assignments of individual states .",
    "we display in the table various resonance contributions ( assuming the @xmath1 description ) to @xmath3 and to @xmath72 .",
    "the mass and decay width values are taken from the pdg listing .",
    "we do not intend our listing to be complete , but instead to indicate the magnitudes associated with contributions of this type .",
    "although smaller than the current experimental limit  @xcite @xmath73 , the values are larger than the contribution @xmath74 from the set of pseudoscalar ground state mesons ( @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) .",
    "they also tend to dominate the short distance ` box ' contributions @xmath79 and @xmath80 , where we have taken @xmath81  gev , @xmath82  gev , and refer effects of qcd radiative corrections to ref .",
    "@xcite .    *",
    "@xmath51 resonance *    in vacuum saturation , contributions to @xmath3 from @xmath1 intermediate states arise mainly from annihilation amplitudes .",
    "it is well known that such amplitudes are subject to helicity suppression .",
    "this is the same effect which influences the observed patterns of leptonic pion and kaon decay modes .",
    "it was noted long ago that the effects of helicity supression can be ( partially ) lifted by soft - gluon emission . while this mechanism can be readily applied to inclusive heavy meson decay , it is difficult to see how to implement it to the mixing matrix elements of eq .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) if the intermediate states are of the @xmath1 variety .",
    "however , this difficulty is avoided if the intermediate state meson is a @xmath83 hybrid state which involves a constituent gluon .",
    "the argument can be further extended to include penguin operators , thus introducing a long - distance counterpart of the dipenguin operator contribution  @xcite .",
    "it is plausible to assume that the gluon produced by a penguin ( or any other operator ) can form a quasibound state along with the @xmath84 quark - antiquark pair , thus producing a hybrid resonance ( _ cf _ fig .  2 ) .",
    "these one - particle intermediate state contributions to @xmath3 might be of importance because of the proximity of the anticipated  @xcite hybrid - meson mass with that of the @xmath6-meson .    in this regard , a particularly interesting candidate is the @xmath85 which has @xmath86 . on the basis of reports from several experimental groups",
    "@xcite along with various quark model analyses  @xcite , it is tempting to assign this particle as a hybrid .",
    "one can then estimate the contribution of @xmath87 to eq .",
    "( [ deltam ] ) provided that the mixing amplitude @xmath88 is known .",
    "this amplitude can be inferred from quark models or even better , determined phenomenologically by using available data on @xmath6 decay rates .",
    "the idea is to search for common decay channels of @xmath6 and @xmath87 where the @xmath87 contribution is manifest and then estimate the mixing amplitude from this .",
    "the situation is as depicted in fig .  3 , in which @xmath89 mixing is followed by @xmath87 decay .",
    "it was noted in theoretical calculations  @xcite and hinted at experimentally that the decay rates @xmath90 are large for a hybrid @xmath87 .",
    "thus one can put an upper bound on the mixing amplitude @xmath91 by introducing a model for the resonant decay of @xmath6-meson via @xmath87  @xcite , @xmath92 the partial decay width for @xmath93 can be written as @xmath94 where @xmath95 for @xmath96 is defined as @xmath97 \\bigg [ 1 - { ( m_{f_1 } - m_{f_2})^2 \\over m_i^2 } \\bigg ] \\ . \\label{lamdef}\\ ] ] a similar formula exists for the @xmath98 transition . in the simplest case , the total decay width of @xmath99 can be saturated by the single partial decay width @xmath100 .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation as this decay mode becomes dominant for the hybrid @xmath99 .",
    "thus , using eq .",

    "resonances contributing as intermediate states to @xmath0 mixing are expected to occur as su(3 ) flavor multiplets .",
    "the contribution of an entire multiplet will vanish in the limit of degenerate light - quark masses due to gim cancellation .",
    "it is not clear how powerful the gim suppression will be , as su(3 ) is known to be badly broken in at least some @xmath6 decays .",
    "for example , there is the experimentally measured ratio  @xcite @xmath104 , which is unity in the @xmath5 limit .",
    "theoretically , it has been suggested that such large breaking is an accumulation of a number relatively minor effects whose ultimate impact is substantial .",
    "@xcite at any rate , large su(3 ) breaking could produce a loophole for evading gim suppression .",
    "consider an octet of excited mesons @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "we use the subscript ` h ' to represent _ heavy _ mesons , and denote the individual members of a resonance octet with the above flavor labels .",

    "either a small or large effect could emerge , for example :    1 .   in the absence of @xmath108-@xmath121 mixing , the combination @xmath123 - @xmath124 - @xmath125 vanishes by virtue of the gell  mann - okubo formula and the remaining dependence in eq .",

    "the second item has the su(3 ) degenerate mass set at a lower value ( still with no @xmath108-@xmath121 mixing ) and a nonzero effect will generally occur , although to be more quantitative would require additional experimental input .",
    "the presence of large symmetry breaking might necessitate a treatment beyond the first - order relations given above .",
    "the motivation most often cited in searches for @xmath0 mixing lies with the possibility of observing a signal from new physics which dominates that from the standard model .",
    "the best experimental limit , recently obtained by e791  @xcite , is well beneath existing estimates of the standard model value .",
    "there are plans to improve on the e791 determination , both at b - factories @xcite and at hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "in addition , preliminary plans at jefferson lab to build a new experimental hall and simultaneously to raise the beam energy suggest the possibility for @xmath0 mixing studies at that facility as well . for all such efforts",
    ", it will be crucial to understand the magnitude of the mixing amplitude from the standard model .    in this paper",

    "we have shown how an enhancement of order @xmath133 can arise from a resonance whose mass lies within several decay widths of @xmath134 and have also have pointed out the importance of lighter resonances due to decay constant dependence in the mixing amplitude . in order to obtain a more detailed understanding of the resonance scenario , we have considered contributions from both traditional @xmath135 resonances as well as an exotic @xmath136 hybrid .",
    "effects of order @xmath137  gev are possible for both @xmath3 and @xmath4 . in addition , it would appear possible or even likely in the resonance mechanism that @xmath138 or even larger .",

    "of course , efforts such as this are severly hampered by a lack of knowledge regarding the properties of mesons lying in the @xmath140  gev mass range .",
