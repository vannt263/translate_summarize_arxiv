    "the essence of the superconductive proximity effect is an existence of cooper correlations between electrons in the normal metal in contact with a superconductor .",
    "the microscopic mechanism leading to the proximity effect is andreev reflection  @xcite of an electron into a hole at a normal - metal  superconducting ( n - s ) interface .",
    "the probability of andreev reflection ( as opposed to the normal reflection ) and thus the strength of the proximity effect is determined by the transparency of the n - s interface , which may be relatively weak due to the presence of a tunnel barrier or mismatch between fermi velocities of two materials .",
    "disorder in the normal conductor near an n - s contact is shown theoretically  @xcite to increase considerably the effective probability of andreev reflection ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review from the experimental viewpoint ) .",
    "however , when the normal conducting region is made of a dirty metal film , or two - dimensional electron gas with low density of electrons , coulomb interaction in the normal region ( neglected in  @xcite ) gets enhanced  @xcite and leads to strong quantum fluctuations which suppress the andreev conductance .",
    "several different kinds of quantum effects are known to be relevant in low - dimensional conductors at low temperatures .",
    "quantum corrections to the conductivity of two - dimensional dirty conductors grow logarithmically as temperature @xmath4 decreases and become large at @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is the dimensionless conductance , @xmath7 is the conductance per square , and @xmath8 is the elastic scattering time ) .",
    "there are two main types of these effects : weak localization corrections  @xcite , and interaction - induced corrections  @xcite .",
    "other important quantum effects include interaction - induced suppression of the tunneling conductance ( coulomb zero - bias anomaly  @xcite ) , and disorder - induced suppression  @xcite of the superconductive transition temperature @xmath9 .",
    "the corresponding corrections are of the relative order of @xmath10 , i.  e. , much stronger than the weak localization and interaction corrections .    in the previous paper",
    "@xcite we have studied the influence of the last two effects on the andreev conductance and the josephson proximity coupling in s - i - n and structures ( where ` i ' denotes an insulating tunnel barrier ) . using the renormalization group method ,",

    "possibility of neglecting coulomb zba effects while treating the coulomb - induced repulsion in the cooper channel  @xcite is due to the fact that the specific form of the coulomb zba depends crucially on the long - range behavior of the coulomb potential , whereas renormalization of the cooper - channel interaction depends on the short - distance coulomb amplitude only .",
    "if long - range coulomb forces are suppressed ( i.  e. , by placing a nearby screening metal gate ) , the coulomb zba effect may become weak , and the main effect comes from the short - range repulsion in the cooper channel .",
    "this is the situation we are going to study in this paper .",

    "it can be shown that the frequency - dependent andreev conductance @xmath47 does not contain significant frequency dependence at scales @xmath48 , due to the long - range nature of the coulomb interaction which makes electron liquid effectively incompressible up to much high frequency scale defined by the inverse time of electric field propagation across the structure .",
