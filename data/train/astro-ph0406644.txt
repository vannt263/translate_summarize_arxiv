    "w51 is a giant radio emitting complex , lying along the tangent to the sagitarius arm at a distance of about 7kpc and having an angular size of about 1@xmath0 .",
    "the complex consists of many hii regions of varying morphologies and compactness , embedded in an extended and diffuse emission . according to convention adopted by kundu & velusamy(1967 )",
    "the source is divided into 3 components , w51 a and b being a collection of compact hii regions while w51c is a nonthermal source that is identified with a supernova remnant ( copetti & schmidt 1991 ) .",
    "the entire complex is optically obscured but has been extensively observed at radio frequencies and the early observations have been reviewed by bieging(1975 ) .",
    "the brightest hii regions are found in w51a , which itself consists of two subcomponents g49.5 - 0.4 and g49.4 - 0.3 .",
    "g49.5 - 0.4 is the most luminous star forming region in the entire complex and has been studied in detail .",
    "high resolution radio continuum observations ( martin 1972 ; mehringer 1994 ; subrahmanyan & goss 1995 ) have identified atleast 8 prominent compact sources in g49.5 - 0.4 which are referred to as g49.5 - 0.4 _ a , b, ... ,h _ in order of increasing right ascension . similarly , g49.4 - 0.3 consists of atleast 3 compact sources g49.4 - 0.3 _ a , b , c _ ( martin 1972 ) .",
    "radio recombination line ( rrl ) studies of g49.5 - 0.4 have been used to study the kinematics and local thermodynamic equilibrium(lte ) electron temperature(@xmath4 ) of this region .",
    "h109@xmath5 rrl observations by wilson et al(1970 ) with a resolution of @xmath6 and by pankonin et al ( 1979 ) with a resolution of @xmath7 show that @xmath86000k in g49.5 - 0.4 .",
    "lower frequency observations for h137@xmath9 and h166@xmath5 lines show higher temperatures of 8500k and 7100k respectively ( pankonin et al 1979 ) .",
    "since lower frequency lines are expected to arise from outer low density parts of the hii regions , this results suggest that there is a temperature gradient that increases radially outwards ( churchwell et al 1978 ) .  from observations of h92@xmath5 lines",
    "mehringer(1994 ) concludes that @xmath4 varies from 4700 to 11000k for the different components with an average of 7800 @xmath10 1200k .",
    "all the rrl results quoted above have been derived under the lte approximation .",
    "the electron temperature is one of the most important parameters in understanding the physical properties of thermal hii regions .",
    "low frequency continuum observations in the optically thick regime offer a direct estimate of the electron temperatures .",
    "meter - wavelength observations at 410mhz by shaver(1969 ) and at 151mhz by copetti & schmidt(1991 ) show that @xmath4 in g49.5 - 0.4 is 3500@xmath10700k and 4650@xmath10500k respectively .",
    "since low frequency continuum observations also arise from the outer parts of hii region , these low temperatures suggest a radial decrease in temperature from the core , which is opposite to the trend seen in rrl studies",
    ". however , subrahmanyan & goss(1995 ) , from 330mhz continuum observation with @xmath11@xmath12 resolution , infer a value of at least 7500k towards g49.5 - 0.4_e _ , the brightest source in g49.5 - 0.4 .",
    "it is possible that the low temperatures obtained by shaver(1969 ) and copetti & schmidt(1991 ) is due to the poor resolution ( @xmath13 ) of their images .    in order to resolve this discrepancy and make an improved determination of the electron temperatures and other physical parameters in the component w51a , we have made high resolution continuum images of the hii regions in w51a using giant meterwave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 240,610,1060 , and 1400mhz",
    "this is the first time that w51 has been observed at meter - wavelengths with arcsec resolutions .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab3 ]      in many of the components like g49.5 - 0.4_a , b , c , f , g _ and all the components of g49.4 - 0.3 , the brightness is higher at 240mhz than expected from the model fits .",
    "the possibility of flux calibration errors at 240mhz was ruled out by the general agreement of our flux density estimates of the components of w51 and 4c13.73 with the expected values based on other observations and the fact that the excess is not seen in some of the components like g49.5 - 0.4_d , e_. the physical location of the gmrt antennas being the same for all the frequencies , the 240mhz observations have better short spacing coverage than at other frequencies and so will more faithfully reproduce the extended emission . to avoid bias due to the extended emission , we have not directly used the observed peak brightness at 240mhz for the sources but have made 1-dimensional cuts in different position angles and estimated the excess of the peak brightness over the local background . while this is a bit subjective ,",
    "we believe that this should reduce the possibility of systematically overestimating the brightness because of the the better short spacing coverage .    for the components with this excess flux ,",
    "if we consider only the 240mhz observations , the measured brightness temperature is comparable to the rrl temperatures .",
    "however , we do not think that this a resolution of the problem of the discrepancy between the rrl and the radio continuum temperatures since this does not take into account the observations at the higher frequencies .",
    "for complex structures , it is reasonable to expect the filling factor to depend on frequency , since different parts of the source get optically thick at different frequencies .",
    "one possible explanation is to consider a spherically symmetric model with a temperature gradient , but that would require the outer regions to be hotter than the inner which may not be reasonable , since the energy source is at the centre .",
    "another possibility is a raisin pudding model , with dense regions embedded in hot plasma . while this may not be unreasonable , the non detection of such fine structure in the high frequency , high resolution maps ( mehringer 1994 ) is a concern .    rather than associating the excess flux at 240 mhz to the compact sources",
    ", one could attribute it to foreground emission that becomes strong at low frequencies .",
    "synchrotron emission , either from the galactic foreground or from relativistic particles in the vicinity , has the property of being stronger at lower frequencies ; but any smooth large scale emission of this type will not be seen by interferometric observations . if interferometric observations picks up fine structure in this emission , then a chance positional coincidence with the foreground enhancement would be required to explain the observed 240 mhz excess .",
    "a more likely explanation is that the excess emission is due to an envelope of hot low density thermal plasma associated with the hii complex , in which all the components are embedded .",
    "this component is optically thin at all the frequencies , including 240mhz and has a flat spectrum characteristic of optically thin thermal emission .",
    "this emission adds brightness to all frequencies , but at 240mhz the emission of the optically thick inner components have fallen to low enough values for this foreground emission to be significant . for this explanation to work ,",
    "the surrounding gas has to have a higher temperature than the compact components and should have structure on sufficiently small scale so that it is seen by the synthesis observations and and is not eliminated by our procedure of determining the peak brightness by taking its excess over the local mean . in the optically thin regime , we are not in a position to make independent estimates of the temperature and density of this component .",
    "we have presented high resolution radio continuum images of the w51 complex made with the gmrt at 240 , 610,1060 and 1400 mhz .",
    "while the 240mhz observations cover the whole complex , the higher frequency observations have focussed on the thermal component known as w51a .",
    "all the subcomponents of w51a are resolved in the @xmath14 images made at all the above frequencies .",
    "combined with vla observations at 5ghz with comparable resolution , the peak brightness of all the components show a well defined thermal spectrum which is optically thick at frequencies less than 1 ghz . the emission measures and the electron temperatures",
    "have been estimated by fitting the observed spectra to standard equation ( eq.3 ) of radiative transfer in hii regions . while the estimated values for some of the components are in reasonable agreement with the estimates from rrl observation , in many of the components , the continuum temperatures are lower than the rrl values .",
    "this suggests that even with this resolution , there are unresolved features in these components and we have estimated the filling factors required to reconcile the two measurements .",
    "the observed brightness of some of the components at 240mhz is higher than expected from the temperature predicted by the fit .",
    "this could be due to a high temperature , low emission measure envelope around the components which could be associated with the w51a complex .",
    "the discrepancies between the temperatures estimated from the continuum and the rrl observations and between continuum observations themselves suggest the need for more complex models for the hii regions including the 3-dimensional distribution of matter in the complex .",
