    "one of the most intriguing results of the rosat all sky survey has been the detection of seven close - by neutron stars ( nss ) , with particular characteristics .",
    "these sources stand apart with respect to other known classes of isolated nss detected at x - ray energies .",
    "their x - ray spectrum is close to a blackbody , and no evidence of radio emission has been reported so far despite deep searches ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are likely to be endowed with relatively strong magnetic fields , @xmath7@xmath8  g , as inferred from x - ray timing measurements and observations of broad spectral lines ( equivalent width @xmath9100  ev , likely due to proton cyclotron and/or bound - free , bound - bound transitions in h , h - like and he - like atoms ) .",
    "this points toward a possible evolutionary link between xdinss , `` magnetars '' ( anomalous x - ray pulsars and soft gamma - repeaters ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review ) , and some of the recently discovered rotating radio transients ( rrats ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* see also heyl & kulkarni 1998 and popov , turolla & possenti  2006 for a discussion ) .",
    "detailed multiwavelength studies of xdinss are fundamental for tracking their evolutionary history , and for shedding light on their thermal and magnetic surface properties . while the xdinss have similar spectral properties in the x - rays , in the optical the paucity of multi - band observations",
    "prevents a clear spectral characterization . for the xdinss with a certified counterpart ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) the optical emission lies typically a factor @xmath10 , or more , above the extrapolation of the x - ray blackbody into the optical / uv band .",
    "however , while the optical flux closely follows a rayleigh - jeans distribution in , possible deviations from a @xmath11 behaviour have been reported for and @xcite . thus , whether the optical emission from xdinss is produced by regions of the star surface at a lower temperature ( e.g. *",
    "* ) or by other mechanisms , such as non - thermal emission from particles in the star magnetosphere or reprocessing of the surface radiation by an optically thin ( to x - rays ) hydrogen layer surrounding the star @xcite , is still under debate .",
    "one of the xdinss which so far eluded optical identification is ( 1rxs j214303.7 + 065419 ) .",
    "this source was firstly identified in a pointed rosat / pspc observation by @xcite ; accurate spectral and timing information were then obtained with _ xmm - newton _   by @xcite .",
    "the epic - pn count rate ( background corrected ) is @xmath12 count / s ( in the 0.12 - 1.2 kev band ) , while the 0.22kev unabsorbed flux is @xmath13  erg@xmath14s@xmath15 .",
    "the epic - pn spectrum is very soft and well fitted by an absorbed blackbody with @xmath16 ev and @xmath17 @xmath18 .",
    "there is evidence for a spectral absorption feature at @xmath19 kev , and for a periodicity at 9.437 s ( @xmath20 confidence level ) with a pulsed fraction of @xmath21 in semiamplitude @xcite .",
    "the first optical follow - ups with the _ ntt _  and with the _ vlt _  revealed no optical counterpart within the _ xmm - newton _  error circle , down to limiting magnitudes of r@xmath2222.8 @xcite and v@xmath23 @xcite , respectively .",
    "additional optical ( b , v , r , i ) and infrared ( j , h and ks ) observations of  performed with the keck , _ vlt _ , blanco and magellan telescopes were recently reported by @xcite , exploiting the subarcsec position obtained through a ddt _ chandra _   observation .",
    "again , no plausible optical and/or infrared counterpart for  was detected down to r @xmath22 25.7 and j @xmath22 22.6 .",
    "radio observations carried out with the parkes 64 m telescope at 2.9 ghz and 708 mhz were also reported by @xcite .",
    "however , they did not show evidence for radio pulsations down to a luminosity of @xmath24 0.02 mjy kpc@xmath25 at 1.4 ghz .",
    "very recently @xcite placed more stringent upper limits on the radio luminosity of rbs1774 , @xmath26 and @xmath27  mjy  kpc@xmath25 for pulsed and bursty emission respectively , which are the most stringent limits obtained to date from radio observations of xdinss .    in this paper , we present the first detection of a candidate optical counterpart to , obtained with the _ vlt_. the observations and data analysis are described in   [ data ] , while discussion and conclusions follow in   [ disc ] and   [ conc ] , respectively .",
    "we performed deep optical imaging of the  field with _ fors1 _",
    "( focal reducer spectrograph ) , a multi - mode instrument for imaging and long - slit / multi - object spectroscopy mounted at the _ vlt _   kueyen telescope ( paranal observatory ) .",
    "the instrument has been recently upgraded with the installation of a new detector which is the mosaic of two 2k@xmath284k e2v ccds , optimized for the blue range . due to vignetting ,",
    "the effective sky coverage of the two ccd chips is smaller than the projected detector field of view , and larger for the upper chip ( dubbed `` norma '' ) .",
    "observations were carried out in service mode on july 11th and 21st 2007 .",
    "_ fors1 _   was set up in its default standard resolution mode , with a 2@xmath282 binning , yielding a pixel size of 0@xmath2925 .",
    "the telescope pointing was set in order to position our target on the `` norma '' ccd chip , and , thanks to its large effective sky coverage ( 7@xmath284 arcmin ) , to include a large number of reference stars for a precise image astrometry . the low gain , fast read - out mode was chosen . sequences of 590 s exposures were obtained through the b bessel filter ( @xmath30 ) , for a total integration time of 8850 and 2950 s in the first and second night , respectively .",
    "the observations were collected in dark time , with an average seeing of @xmath31 and @xmath32 and an airmass @xmath33 and @xmath34 on the first and second night , respectively .",
    "the usual reduction steps ( bias subtraction , flat - fielding ) were applied to the data through the eso _ fors1 _",
    "data reduction pipeline using calibration frames acquired as part of the _ fors1",
    "_  calibration plan .",
    "then , single reduced images were aligned and coadded to filter out cosmic rays using the iraf task imcombine .",
    "the photometric calibration was performed through the observation of standard stars from the fields pg 1323@xmath35086 , pg 1633 + 099 , sa 113@xmath35239 @xcite at the beginning of the night .",
    "this yielded nominal extinction and color - corrected zero points of @xmath36 and @xmath37 for the first and the second night , respectively .",
    "the atmospheric extinction correction was applied using the extinction coefficients of the paranal observatory measured with the upgraded _ fors1 _  ( @xmath38 for the `` norma '' chip ) . since the zero point computed by the _ fors1 _",
    "pipeline is in units of e@xmath39/s , while the flux on the image is measured in adu / s , we corrected the computed zero point by applying the detector electrons  to  adu conversion factor ( gain=0.45 ) .",
    "according to the paranal observatory sky monitor and weather report , sky conditions were photometric on the first night and at the beginning of the second night but they were then affected by the presence of thin , variable cirri .",
    "this means that the photometry of the second night is affected by a random , unknown uncertainty .",
    "we have tried to quantify this uncertainty by comparing the photometry of a number of reference field stars observed in the two nights .",
    "the star detection was performed using the _ sextractor _ program and magnitudes were computed through customized aperture photometry ( _ sextractor _",
    "parameter mag_auto ) . in all sources detected at the flux level expected for our target ( b@xmath40 )",
    ", we found an average offset of @xmath41 magnitudes between the photometry of the two nights .",
    "such a large scatter for faint objects is due to the fact that their flux measurement is more sensitive on the varying atmospheric conditions than that of the bright ones .",
    "thus , if data of the two nights are combined , this would result in only a modest increase of the s / n ratio at the expenses of a worse photometric accuracy for our target .",
    "we thus decided not to use the data taken on the second night .",
    "the astrometry on the _ fors1 _",

    ", stellar - like objects that are saturated or too faint to be used as reliable astrometric calibrators , objects falling close to the chip edges , and outliers , we performed our astrometric calibration using 20 _ gsc-2 _  reference stars , evenly distributed in the instrument field of view .",
    "their pixel coordinates were measured by gaussian fitting their intensity profiles with the gaia ( graphical astronomy and image analysis ) tool while the fit to the celestial reference frame was performed using the starlink package astrom .",
    "this code is based on higher order polynomials , which account for unmodelled ccd distorsions .",
    "the rms of the astrometric solution was determined as @xmath42 011 , per coordinate .",
    "following caraveo et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we estimated the overall uncertainty of our astrometry by adding in quadrature the rms of the astrometric fit and the accuracy with which we can register our field on the _ gsc-2 _   reference frame .",
    "this is estimated as @xmath43 , where the @xmath44 term accounts for the free parameters ( x - scale , y - scale , and rotation angle ) in the astrometric fit , @xmath45 is the mean ( radial ) error of the _ gsc-2 _  coordinates ( 03 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and @xmath46 is the number of stars used for the astrometric calibration .",
    "the uncertainty on the reference stars centroids is well below 0.1 pixel and has been neglected .",
    "we also added in quadrature the radial uncertainty on the tie of the _ gsc-2 _   to the icrf ( 015 ; * ? ? ?",

    "we show both the original and the revised error circles at the 90% and 99% c.l .",

    "we computed its magnitude through aperture photometry , by using a customized aperture and background region , following the same procedure described in the previous sections .",
    "the background was computed in an annular region centered on the target , in order to have the most reliable estimate close to the position of our source .",
    "the measured value , corrected for the atmospheric extinction using the trended _ fors1 _",

    "this yields an estimated chance coincidence probability @xmath66 which shows that our association is robust .. ] thus , we are confident that we have identified a very likely optical counterpart to .",
    "the flux of our candidate counterpart in the b band , after correcting for interstellar extinction , is @xmath67  kev/@xmath68/s ( the error is at @xmath47 c.l . ) . to compute this value",
    ", we used the column density derived from the best fit to the _ xmm - newton _  spectrum ( @xmath69 @xmath14 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the @xmath70 derived according to the relation of @xcite .",
    "the interstellar extinction in the @xmath71-band has been computed using the extinction coefficients of @xcite .",
    "when compared to the extrapolation in the b band of the blackbody which best - fits the _ xmm - newton _   spectrum , @xmath72  kev/@xmath68/s @xcite , this gives an optical excess of @xmath73 ( at @xmath5 c.l . ) , where all the uncertainties on the magnitude  to  flux conversion are negligible .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , where the optical / ir upper limits of @xcite are also overplotted . the optical excess is larger than that typically observed in other xdinss , and this may cast some doubts on the association of the newly detected source with . on the other hand ,",
    "if , as we suggest , the association is real , it can be used to infer physical constraints on the mechanism that is responsible for the optical emission .",
    "the first scenario we consider is one in which the optical emission originates from a cooler fraction of the neutron star surface , which emits as a blackbody at temperature @xmath74 @xcite . in this case",
    ", the ratio between the optical and x - ray fluxes scales as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the radial size of the cold region ( which of course can not exceed the maximum value of the neutron star radius ) , @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the blackbody radius and temperature as inferred from the x - ray spectrum , @xmath79  ev , @xmath80  km @xcite . by making an assumption on @xmath76",
    "we can obtain the lower limit on @xmath74 that corresponds to values of @xmath81 between the central value and the @xmath58 lower limit ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "furthermore , since no contribution from such a cold component is observed in the 0.1 - 1  kev _ xmm - newton _   spectrum , it must be @xmath83 , where @xmath84 we repeated this calculation by varying the distance between @xmath85 and @xmath86  pc and for @xmath87 or @xmath88  km .",
    "results show that this scenario is only barely compatible with our data and requires very small distances : @xmath89  pc are only allowed within @xmath58 _ and _ for neutron star radii as large as @xmath90  km , while if @xmath91  km the only allowed combinations require @xmath92 and @xmath93  pc . on the other hand ,",
    "the lower the distance the smaller is the size of the x - ray emitting region and the more difficult is to explain the small pulsed fraction observed in the x - rays ( which is @xmath94 in semiamplitude ) . as we tested by assuming simple polar cap modelling and blackbody emission , if @xmath95  pc the allowed parameter space is already confined to a very small region where the inclination angles of the line of sight and of the magnetic dipole axis with respect to the star spin axis are both @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath97  pc , the allowed region is even smaller and the only possible configurations require the star to be either a perfectly aligned rotator or viewed almost along its spin axis .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , spectral models consisting of bare neutron stars surrounded by thin atmospheres may predict very different amount of optical excess . however , such models are affected by our poor knowledge of the properties of the condensate surface , and whether they can produce optical excesses as large as that measured here is still an open issue .",
    "an alternative interpretation is that the optical emission is non thermal , probably of magnetospheric origin @xcite . as it can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , a power law spectral component @xmath98 matching the b - flux and with index @xmath99 is not in contradiction with the upper limits measured at longer wavelengths and , at the same time , is not expected to contribute significantly to the x - ray band .",
    "these constraints on the optical spectral index are compatible with the values determined from the optical spectra of rotation - powered neutron stars , which are all in the range 00.8 ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this respect , we note that for the xdinss for which the spin down luminosity is measured @xcite it is @xmath100  erg / s .",
    "if the case of  is analogous , and if we take @xmath101 for the optical emission efficiency ( as measured in old rotation - powered neutron stars by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this yields an optical luminosity of @xmath102  erg / s . in order to reproduce the observed flux of our candidate counterpart , after accounting for the assumed interstellar extinction ,",
    "should be at an unrealistically small distance of @xmath103 pc .",
    "thus , for the assumed value of @xmath104 , a purely rotation - powered optical emission is only compatible with a scenario in which our source is at least a two orders of magnitude more efficient optical emitter ( see below ) .",
    "similar conclusions can be reached if we consider the case in which the observed optical emission of  is due to a composite mechanism consisting of both thermal emission from the neutron star surface and a rotation - powered magnetospheric emission ( as in the middle - aged neutron stars psr  b0656 + 14 and geminga , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "a further , intriguing possibility is that the optical emission is non - thermal and powered by a mechanism different from rotation .",
    "interestingly , at least in the ir domain , hints have been found for an increase of the low - energy emission efficiency with the dipole magnetic field strength @xcite .",
    "indeed , in magnetars the efficiency is at least two orders of magnitude larger than in rotation - powered neutron stars and the spectra show a typical ( and unexplained ) flattening toward the infrared @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note the magnetic field strength of  as inferred from the absorption feature in the x - ray spectrum is the highest among all xdinss ( @xmath105  g ) , larger than the qed critical limit and comparable with that of magnetars .",
    "the optical emission of  could thus be powered by a magnetar - like process .",
    "if the spectrum of  shows a similar magnetar - like turn over , then the flattening is appearing blueward of the ir band .",
    "we report here the deepest optical observations so far of the  field , performed with the upgraded _ fors1",

    "vlt_. for the most reasonable distance range to the x - ray source , the measured brightness of the candidate counterpart ( b@xmath106 ) is barely compatible with purely thermal emission from the neutron star surface , while , assuming a value of @xmath107 similar to that of other xdinss , rotation - powered emission from the magnetosphere ( eventually in combination with a thermal component ) requires  to have a very large optical efficiency ( @xmath108 order of magnitudes larger than the crab for @xmath109  pc ) .",
