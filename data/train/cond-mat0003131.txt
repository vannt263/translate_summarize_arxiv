    "roughness of fracture surfaces ( fs ) is a currently topical problem that has opened up surprising connections between engineering and weakly understood questions of statistical physics .",
    "the simple question why and how a crack surface becomes rough dodges easy answers since there is a multitude of experimental facts and ways for cracks to develop or propagate .",
    "one simplification , adopted in this work is to neglect cases in which the prevalent feature is the propagation of `` fast '' cracks in the favor of slow , adiabatic crack formation .",
    "the questions we address here are related to how disorder affects crack surfaces and how interfaces born out of different load - elongation responses are related .",
    "disorder is present in materials at all length scales in the form of atomic impurities , dislocations , grain boundaries and so forth .",
    "no generally accepted picture exists yet of how slow cracks are formed and how it relates to crack interfaces @xcite . in three dimensions",
    "there are indications that the cracks become above a certain intermediate length scale self - affine so that the roughness exponent @xmath2 is close to 0.8 .",
    "moreover the physics of crack advancement indicates that the generic features of phase transitions of driven lines ( crack fronts in three dimensions ) become relevant @xcite .",
    "quantitative agreement is however missing . for slow fracture in two dimensions ( 2d ) and at small length scales in 3d",
    "the interface scaling may be different in that the exponents are close to those of the minimum energy ( me ) interface .",
    "these are the same as for the random exchange ising model ( reim ) domain walls at zero temperature , and have therefore the exact value @xmath3 in 2d  @xcite and the approximate value @xmath4 in 3d  @xcite .",
    "the physics involved is simple : the crack minimizes up to the pertinent length scale the surface energy @xmath5 given by @xmath6 , \\label{eqe}\\ ] ] where the integral counts in two contributions .",
    "one arises from a surface stiffness ( proportional to @xmath7 ) due to the deviations @xmath8 from a straight crack , and a second from a random disorder potential with a two - point correlator @xmath9 where the disorder average is implied and @xmath10,@xmath11 denote two locations inside the medium .",
    "the exponents quoted above are true in case the disorder has point - like correlations .",
    "the fluctuations of the potential would in an experiment correspond to a varying failure threshold or elastic modulus etc .",
    ", depending on the circumstances .",
    "the closeness of the numerical values of the roughness exponents gives rise to the intriguing question as to why should a slow fracture resemble a global optimization like ground state domain walls ?",
    "the connection is suggested by the fact that in arbitrary dimensions , lattice models that describe scalar perfect plasticity can be exactly mapped to the reim domain wall problems . for brittle fracture or vectorial failure problems in general",
    "the correspondence is not obvious .",
    "two - dimensional failure is special in that there is some experimental evidence of the crack roughness scaling with the domain wall in reim , i.e. the so called directed polymer ( dp ) , global roughness exponent  @xcite .",
    "this connection between global optimization and fracture surfaces has also been made in 2d simulations of brittle failure  @xcite . in 3d , it is still unclear whether even just numerical models show such a universality  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we investigate in two dimensions the scaling properties of slow fracture surfaces and compare them to minimum energy surfaces with similar _ a priori _ disorder .",
    "we perform numerical simulations of the random fuse network ( rfn ) model , which has been studied extensively as a model of brittle failure of disordered materials @xcite . as a warm up",
    ", we consider extensive system properties such as fracture stress , fracture strain , and damage .",
    "for the main case studied here , the dilution - type disorder , these are found to be in good agreement with the critical defect -type arguments proposed by duxbury and co - workers  @xcite that imply logarithmic scaling with system size .",
    "note that when comparing with `` reality '' this kind of models contain two assumptions : first , the stress relaxation is supposed to be much faster than the stress rate ( an adiabatic failure ) .",
    "second , one assumes that the energy released by local crack formation is dissipated with no effect on the crack propagation .",
    "the paper starts with a short description of the numerical methods used and the dynamics of the adiabatic crack formation in section  [ num ] .",
    "section  [ scale ] discusses the strength properties of random fuse networks as a function of system size @xmath1 .",
    "there are a number of ways to characterize a posteriori a self - affine interface .",
    "this is the main theme of section  [ sample ] , the topic of showing that 2d brittle fracture interfaces have the dp - type scaling .",
    "we demonstrate how both the so - called local width and the statistical properties of ensembles of interfaces indicate a similar kind of self - affine scaling .",
    "the scaling exponent is seen to be close to the dp one , @xmath3 .",
    "the section also contains numerical data for varying disorder strength , and in particular compares perfect plasticity and brittle fracture by measuring the overlap of the associated interfaces starting with the same disorder configurations",
    ". this would be particularly relevant should it be so that the fracture and yield interfaces use the same `` valley '' in the landscape of the energies or thresholds .",
    "the paper is finished with a discussion in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "random fuse networks are electrical analogues of elasticity and failure with disorder incorporated .",
    "one usually sets to mimic a tensile test implying that the extensive thermodynamic parameters become @xmath12 and @xmath13 , external voltage and current , respectively .",
    "these correspond to displacement and force in a real experiment .",
    "to study brittle failure one defines the elements that connect two nodes on an original lattice as _",
    "these have a linear voltage - current relationship until a breakdown current @xmath14 , see fig .",
    "a second choice would correspond to perfect plasticity if one made the fuses such that the local current becomes irreversibly constant at @xmath15 and stays so unless the local voltage is reduced , in which case the conductivity becomes the original one and there is a permanent _ yield strain_.    in the following we use two different numerical techniques to study both brittle and perfectly plastic rfn s .",
    "brittle failure is studied with standard adiabatic fracture iterations .",
    "these consist of solving the current balance in the system from kirchoff s and ohm s laws and breaking after each iteration the most strained fuse ( the criterion is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the local current in each of the fuses and @xmath18 is the local threshold ) .",
    "the currents and voltages are found by solving the linear system of currents by the conjugate - gradient method .",
    "for perfect plasticity we use a mapping to minimum energy interfaces , i.e. random exchange ising domain walls in their ground state , where exchange constants @xmath19 between nearest neighboring spins are random but non - negative . in some cases we have exactly the same quenched disorder ( equal thresholds for failure @xmath14 and yielding @xmath20 for each fuse ) as for brittle failure , and in the following the threshold for a fuse in both cases",
    "is denoted by @xmath21 .",
    "the simulations are done using combinatorial optimization : finding the yield path ( in 2d ) is equivalent to the minimum cut - maximum flow problem of network flows  @xcite that minimizes @xmath22 .",
    "this technique is more convenient than the transfer matrix methods in that there are no restrictions for the shape of the optimal path as overhangs and arbitrary transverse steps are included in a natural fashion .",
    "the typical choice for introducing disorder to a rfn is to pick the failure currents @xmath21 from a prescribed probability distribution @xmath23 .",
    "the important issue is the behavior of @xmath24 for @xmath25 and for @xmath26 ; the tails of the distribution are known to have strong effects on the strength properties and damage accumulation in the case of brittle fracture . for perfect plasticity or directed polymers",
    "the case is much simpler in that for one dimensional interfaces in @xmath27 dimensional systems such point - like disorder is in the renormalization group sense always relevant .",
    "thus one expects always the same scaling properties in terms of interface roughness and sample - to - sample interface energy fluctuations , these correspond to yield stress fluctuations in plasticity .",
    "the amplitudes are however non - universal and thus will depend on the exact form of @xmath24 .    in the following we study as typical examples the cases where @xmath28 is a flat distribution ( @xmath29 for @xmath30 ) and where @xmath24 corresponds to `` dilution disorder '' .",
    "that is @xmath31 .",
    "the fraction of fuses that remain for infinitesimal currents with dilution is denoted with @xmath32 , which has a value @xmath33 unless otherwise mentioned , like for the uniform distribution case @xmath34 .",
    "the systems are chosen so that the direction of macroscopic current flow is aligned in the @xmath35 orientation of the square lattice having periodic boundaries in the perpendicular direction .",
    "the systems are isomorphic , i.e. @xmath36 , and their sizes range from @xmath37 to @xmath38 for brittle failure and to @xmath39 for perfect plasticity , respectively .",
    "the mean positions of the surfaces are not fixed , hence they may sit anywhere in the system .",
    "the interfaces are defined in the usual way so that in the case of overhangs , the so called solid - on - solid approximation is used , i.e. the interface is found by taking the furthest value of the interface with respect to a fixed end of the network .",
    "the number of realizations @xmath40 over which the disorder - averaging is performed is limited by the cpu - time for the simulations of the brittle fracture . in the case of plasticity",
    ", the technique used leads to a roughly linear scaling with respect the number of fuses in a system regardless of the threshold distribution .",
    "the number of different random realizations is shown in table  [ tabn ] for the cases in which exactly the same random networks are studied for both the brittle failure and the perfect plasticity . if only the me - surfaces are studied @xmath41 .",
    "one should note that if fracture surfaces have non - trivial geometric scaling properties and in particular resemble directed polymers ( in 2d ) this opens up several further questions : whether the outcome is independent of disorder strength , whether the disorder is always relevant for 2d minimum energy surfaces , and how the surface roughness relates to other typical quantities .",
    "the standard way of iterating fracture in fuse networks , whether perfectly plastic or brittle , is based on extremal dynamics .",
    "the condition @xmath16 for the failure of the next element contains two effects : the disorder through the threshold and the local current that depends on the environment of the fuse .    for perfect plasticity , the information necessary for finding the final yield surface is contained in the initial field",
    "@xmath18 due to the monotonicity property noticed by roux and hansen  @xcite .",
    "even if one simulates the development of the system as a serie of fuse network problems ( the tangent problem ) , the local current never decreases in a yielding process .",
    "thus the final yield surface equals a blocking configuration that can be calculated from the original thresholds .",
    "this is related to the fact that the surface is much faster to compute than the whole process by considering it as an optimization problem for the interface : the history of the whole process or system involves much more information .",
    "for brittle fracture the monotonicity property is not true and thus no direct mapping exists between the initial disorder and a quantity to be minimized .",
    "the mapping of perfect plasticity to fuse networks makes it on the other hand clear that the difference between the processes is smaller than it would seem at the first glance .",
    "this is because in the tangent algorithm one has to solve a serie of adiabatic failure problems with the local yield thresholds @xmath15 renormalized by subtracting the current already passing through the fuse",
    ". nonetheless each failure iteration is affected by stress - enhancement effects exactly as in a failure problem with the same fuses still intact .",
    "for brittle failure , the implication of the stress - enhancements during the failure process is that in order to obtain a minimum energy surface ( as defined by eq .",
    "( [ eqe ] ) ) the original disorder @xmath42 has to be _",
    "renormalized_. that is , the thresholds or missing fuses contain frozen - in information about how the field of local stresses will develop and normalize the local thresholds @xmath42 in the failure criterion .",
    "considered in this light , it is sensible that the brittle fracture surfaces are `` blocking paths '' , too .",
    "yet the question remains whether the interfaces are still in the same _ universality class _ : if the correlations in the renormalized disorder become different enough from point - like correlations the interface scaling properties will change .",
    "e.g. columnar correlations ( @xmath43 constant along @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) would be relevant in this respect .",
    "a fracture can be contrasted with perfect plasticity also by looking at extensive thermodynamic quantities .",
    "the standard ones to consider are the damage @xmath46 , the number of fuses broken in total , and the failure current @xmath47 and voltage @xmath48 as computed from the maximum current of the @xmath49-curve . for `` truly '' brittle failure",
    "this definition of @xmath48 agrees with with that defined as the end point of the @xmath49-curve . in the failure of brittle fuse networks",
    "there is considerable evidence for the relevance of critical defect -type effects .",
    "that is , the defect with the largest current enhancement will dictate the scaling of the current and voltage . for yield surfaces",
    "one would have @xmath50 , @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath2 is the roughness exponent .",
    "thus the critical strength quantities , without the renormalization discussed above , are supposed to have different scaling behavior in plasticity and fracture .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the scaling of damage and the strength quantities for dilution - type disorder , @xmath33 .",
    "the lines in the figure have been found with least - square - fits to data using the assumptions of linear scaling for @xmath46 and for the other two quantities the scaling @xmath53 , which comes from the extreme value statistics , i.e. gumbel distribution , studied in the fracture case by duxbury and coauthors  @xcite .",
    "it is seen that the scaling of the number of broken fuses is asymptotically very close to a linear one .",
    "this means that the system still breaks in a brittle mode for @xmath33 . for @xmath48 and @xmath47",
    "the scaling in the whole regime follows beautifully the @xmath54 scaling .",
    "notice that the surface energy of yield surfaces is in principle a lower limit for @xmath46 and that both scale linearly .",
    "one sees that the energy of yield surfaces or the lower limit for @xmath46 is lower by a constant factor than @xmath46 of fracture surfaces .",
    "similar behavior is visible in the roughness values of the fracture and yield surfaces studied in the next section .",
    "there are several ways to characterize the scaling properties of interfaces .",
    "consider the case where an interface is defined as a function of @xmath55 as @xmath56 .",
    "the standard way of looking at scaling properties is to calculate the interface width  @xcite or standard deviation , i.e. the so - called root - mean - square ( rms ) roughness , @xmath57 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle^{1/2 } , \\label{w_eq}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 denotes the mean position of an interface and @xmath59 the disorder - average over the different random configurations .",
    "if the interface is self - affine , @xmath60 should scale with @xmath61 , @xmath2 being the roughness scaling exponent . for self - affine interfaces the scaling exponent @xmath2",
    "is expected to be valid also for higher - order statistics .",
    "this is seen for the height - height correlation functions and is applicable to the local width as well .",
    "note that there is no a priori reason to use a family - vicsek - type of scaling ansatz with a correlation length  @xcite , since there is no dynamical length scale for these interfaces .",
    "this is an assumption for brittle failure , and it will be shown to hold by our data below , and is moreover exactly true for perfect plasticity .",
    "it is also theoretically appealing since slow , adiabatic failure does not involve any time scale .    the local width in two - dimensions",
    "is defined analogously to the global interface roughness @xmath60 with @xmath62 ^ 2 \\right \\rangle , \\label{w_loc}\\ ] ] where the local interface height @xmath63 is averaged over windows of size @xmath64 .",
    "one should note the obvious connection to @xmath65 that exists both for the local and global definitions of interface width .",
    "the advantage of using more complicated indicators of scaling is that one can draw conclusions based on data in a much more limited system size range than with the global interface width .",
    "of course , such a posteriori techniques are most commonly used in the context of characterizing experimental fracture surfaces . here",
    "we note the fact that for small @xmath1 finite size effects make it rather difficult to determine the roughness exponent ( if one assumes the interfaces to be truly self - affine to begin with ) .",
    "this is especially true for 3d systems for which the computational costs become prohibitive easily .",
    "the global interface roughness @xmath60 as a function of system size is compared between directed polymers and brittle fracture interfaces with the dilution - type disorder and uniform distribution of @xmath21 in fig .",
    "as expected , for small @xmath1 the systems suffer from finite size effects having exponent greater than @xmath3 but eventually the exponent becomes comparable to the value one obtains by fitting a power - law to the large-@xmath1-data .",
    "specifically , in the dilution case , fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , the effective exponent for the fracture surfaces is @xmath66 and for the minimum energy interfaces with exactly the same random threshold configurations @xmath67 . for larger system sizes , which we are able to study numerically only in the plasticity limit with large enough number of realizations , @xmath68 . for the fuses from the uniform random distribution , fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) , the fracture surfaces scale with @xmath69 and the yield surfaces from the networks with exactly the same random configurations have @xmath67 . hence the finite sizes effects seem to be more similar between the processes than in the dilution case . for the larger system sizes of minimum energy interfaces @xmath70 .",
    "[ fig4 ] compares the local width of directed polymers to the brittle fracture interface for the dilution - type disorder with @xmath33 . for the directed polymers one sees that the @xmath3 scaling is valid for larger system sizes in the region , where the window size @xmath71 . with open boundary conditions",
    "the scaling region would be larger .",
    "however , for smaller system size @xmath72 there is a visible amplitude difference compared to the larger system sizes .",
    "the fracture surfaces show similar behavior but have larger finite size effects when compared to the yield surfaces , and they have a larger amplitude , too , than minimum energy surfaces in local and in global width scaling .",
    "our result supports the conclusion of ref .",
    "@xcite that 2d brittle fracture surfaces are in the directed polymer -universality class ( @xmath73 ) , although due to the stronger finite size effects the asymptotic region is harder to reach than for yield surfaces .",
    "next we address the higher - order statistics of fracture surfaces . for directed polymers",
    "one knows that the end - point transverse deviation distribution @xmath74 , ( @xmath75 in the ordinary dp notation ) , is roughly gaussian for the standard case of one fixed , one free end ( see e.g.@xcite ) and follows a scaling form @xmath76 \\sim f(z / l^\\zeta ) $ ] .",
    "one can likewise write down a scaling form for the interface energy .",
    "next we assume that the brittle fracture interfaces obey similar self - affine scaling and study the roughness probability distribution @xmath77 as a function of @xmath1 ( we concentrate on the @xmath33 case of the previous subsection ) .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows a typical example of such distribution : it is not centered around zero and is reminiscent of a log - normal or poissonian distribution .",
    "this can be understood qualitatively since the roughness @xmath60 is also a measure of the non - zero maximum transverse displacement @xmath45 .",
    "the figure includes a distribution for me surfaces from the same systems , too .",
    "as one could see already in the previous subsection , the 2d fracture surfaces are rougher than the minimum energy surfaces ( i.e. assuming self - affine scaling in both cases , the amplitude of the roughness @xmath78 is larger for fs ) .",
    "this is visible also here since the distribution of @xmath79 is not only wider but extends to higher values for the fracture case . while assuming that @xmath79 follows the same self - affine scaling law as the @xmath76 $ ] we may study the disorder - standard deviation @xmath80 where @xmath60 is from a single random system and @xmath81 is the global disorder - averaged roughness calculated using eq .",
    "( [ w_eq ] ) .",
    "@xmath82 scales with @xmath83 , too , although the data is more scattered due to the fact that higher - order statistics are always more vulnerable to the finiteness of the statistics than the integral of them .    in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we collapse the data of the cumulative sums of the distributions @xmath77 for various @xmath1 .",
    "for both kinds of interfaces the data - collapse is better with exponents @xmath84 , which is due the finite size effects . for fracture surfaces",
    "@xmath85 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) , seems to work nicely , like for the yield surfaces @xmath86 would be better than @xmath73 . in our opinion",
    "the figure justifies the assumption of an asymptotically self - similar scaling of @xmath87 \\sim f(w / l^\\zeta)$ ] .",
    "the average overlap @xmath88 of fracture and minimum energy surfaces as a function of the system size for the dilution case is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig7](a ) .",
    "overlap is defined as the fraction of the disorder realizations in which at least one @xmath89 coordinate pair is common with the fracture and yield surfaces .",
    "clearly the overlap is reduced as a function of the system size .",
    "this is not surprising , because with increasing system size the probability of the first breaks taking place at the globally weakest place decreases .",
    "however , if one expects the overlap quantity to originate from the result of depositing the surfaces randomly ( as particles of finite width on a 1d line segment of length @xmath1 ) , one obtains @xmath90 .",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 are prefactors needed to compute the typical geometrical extent from the roughness values @xmath93 , @xmath94 . in the figure we have plotted @xmath95 from the same rfn configurations as @xmath88 , with @xmath96 , which is a rather large value to be realistic , hence @xmath97 . in the figure",
    "@xmath95 has a slope @xmath98 while the asymptotic scaling according to the random deposition argument should be @xmath99 . for small systems",
    "the average overlap is very large , of the order of 0.5 in the particular case studied here .",
    "[ fig7](b ) shows the average size @xmath100 of overlapping clusters .",
    "the overlapping cluster is defined as the number of the neighboring common @xmath89 coordinate pairs .",
    "the overlap cluster size saturates at @xmath101 . fig .",

    "since in the large @xmath1 limit @xmath109 , @xmath110 , there is a crossover in the systems of size @xmath111 , because in the small system size limit @xmath112 must be smaller than @xmath1 . on the other hand @xmath113",
    "tells us that approximately 15% of the length of the fracture and yield surfaces are overlapping with each other .",
    "the scenario is that if the fracture happens to start from the same minimum energy valley where the dp is located , it will naturally stay localized there ; however , the associated surface stiffness is weaker and thus the excursions .",
    "notice the saturation of the cluster size , which agrees with the scenario .",
    "[ fignew ] shows four examples of what happens with varying disorder strength @xmath114 for @xmath115 .",
    "the subplots demonstrate several effects .",
    "for the weakest disorder , both the interfaces are nevertheless `` rough '' ( i.e. not flat ) , which shows that in spite of a single , growing crack even the brittle fracture case can produce a crack which fluctuates in the transverse direction .",
    "the qualitative behavior is the same for both the cases , note that for the yield surfaces one expects a larkin - lengthscale on which the interfaces look flat due to the competition between disorder and elasticity . with increasing disorder the crack is finally localized in the lower part of the system - the threshold field is rescaled in all the cases with the `` initial '' random number being kept constant .",
    "meanwhile the damage for brittle fracture grows strongly .",
    "notice how the yield ( minimum energy ) surface moves in the system as @xmath114 is being changed .",
    "for the two cases with weakest disorder the surface stays the same . in two of the subplots",
    "there is considerable overlap between the fracture and the yield surfaces : @xmath116 leads to a total overlap of @xmath117 82 .",
    "[ fig8 ] shows the dependencies of the roughness and overlap quantities on the disorder strength . both for the dilution case ,",
    "[ fig8](a ) , and for the systems with the randomness from the uniform distribution , fig .",
    "[ fig8](b ) , the fracture and yield surfaces are always rough , except for the finite size effects in the small @xmath114 limit . even in this case the strong disorder fixed point is attractive and we simply have that the system size is smaller than the larkin length above which the asymptotic behavior is seen .",
    "the roughness increases with decreasing @xmath32 until the bond - percolation limit @xmath118 is reached and the surfaces become fractals , with the corresponding hull exponent . in the insets the average overlap @xmath88 and the average overlapping cluster size @xmath119 are shown .",
    "@xmath88 increases for both type of disorder with increasing disorder strength , except in the infinitesimal disorder @xmath120 and @xmath121 limits , where it naturally diverges , the same is true for @xmath100 even with finite disorder . in order to compare @xmath88 with the random deposition argument ,",
    "@xmath95 is plotted from the data of the same configurations with @xmath122 showing again @xmath123 .",
    "@xmath119 seems to saturate with increasing disorder strength for both types of disorder around @xmath124 , which might be a coincidence , since one could guess it to be disorder - type dependent .",
    "this paper has explored the connections between brittle fracture and minimum energy surfaces .",
    "we have given numerical support for the idea of these being in the same universality class in two spatial dimensions .",
    "this argument is based on the scaling of interface width , local roughness and the statistics of ensembles of interfaces . for both scalar brittle fracture and perfect plasticity , or minimum energy ,",
    "interfaces these turn out to have similar scaling properties , indicating that the brittle fracture interfaces have a roughness exponent of 2/3 ( the directed polymer one ) and are also truly self - affine . in spite of the fact that we have studied only two types of disorder distributions , we nevertheless believe that the numerics points to a picture of asymptotically rough cracks in spite of the stress - enhancement effects , that one would expect to play a role in brittle fracture with a large , dominating crack . such is the case in particular for the dilution - type , relatively weak disorder , a main part of our study .",
    "notice that for weak disorder even minimum energy surfaces tend to be relatively flat as the amplitude of the roughness is small .",
    "the results presented earlier were obtained for systems that were governed by extreme scaling - type arguments .",
    "the role of the disorder can be tested in another way , more relevant to standard fracture surface experiments , by introducing a notch , or a row of pre - failed fuses .",
    "the current distribution around the crack tip is a combination of the enhancement effect of the crack plus the additional fluctuations created by possible off - path or fracture process zone damage .",
    "born - model simulations by caldarelli et al .",
    "@xcite show that self - affine cracks can avoid surface tension effects , i.e. they do not straighten out , if started from point seeds . in our case",
    "the question becomes if the effective surface tension of the notch plus the grown crack wins over disorder , remembering that the stress enhancement for a symmetric crack is largest on - axis .",
    "this is a necessary mechanism for any self - affine behavior , whether of the minimum energy surface universality class or not .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows the interface roughness of yield and brittle fracture surfaces for a fixed system size and varying notch length .",
    "it transpires that for both me and brittle fracture surfaces the notch effect does not equal to flattening .",
    "note the earlier arguments that yield surfaces have a _ higher _ surface tension .",
    "this is again due to the memory effect , which renormalizes the thresholds in the tangent problems so that they are the smallest on the crack axis .",
    "there are several experimental indications of the conclusion that brittle fracture interfaces exhibit self - affine behavior , with a roughness exponent close if not equal to the perfect plasticity one .",
    "experiments done on real materials can bridge the gap between the two extreme limits . for such studies the expected behavior would in 2d ,",
    "assuming slow failure , be self - affine as well .",
    "the extraction of the roughness exponent has here been done using the local width as a measure . for ensembles of experiments",
    "one should note the statistical implications of the scaling of the roughness distribution width and of the shape of the width probability distribution .",
    "the relative `` irrelevance '' of a notch hints about the possibility of pinning center -like scaling properties as should be true for the perfect plasticity case : the notch pins the final crack with certainty if it is large enough .",
    "finally we note that there is no rigorous theoretical argument that would explain why brittle fracture seems to follow me - type scaling .",
    "indeed we have here studied only the scaling of the interface roughness , and the aspect of interface energetics in terms of e.g. the energy fluctuation exponent @xmath125 has been left aside . notice that the bare strength properties are governed by logarithmic effects in the case of the brittle failure . for brittle fracture interfaces to result from global optimization",
    "the initial failure thresholds have to be renormalized by the correlations which the stress - intensities of the crack history induces .",
    "for such extremal statistics processes no theory exists for the time being , unlike for the case of the quenched laplacian breakdown model for which one can use real - space renormalization @xcite .",

    "<S> the roughness properties of two - dimensional fracture surfaces as created by the slow failure of random fuse networks are considered and compared to yield surfaces of perfect plasticity with similar disorder . by studying systems up to a linear size @xmath0 it is found that in the cases studied the fracture surfaces exhibit self - affine scaling with a roughness exponent close to 2/3 , which is asymptotically exactly true for plasticity though finite - size effects are evident for both . </S>",
    "<S> the overlap of yield or minimum energy and fracture surfaces with exactly the same disorder configuration is shown to be a decreasing function of the system size and to be of a rather large magnitude for all cases studied . </S>",
