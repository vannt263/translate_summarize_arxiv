    "the objects of study in this paper are the groups @xmath0 over the ring @xmath2 of integers in the imaginary quadratic number field @xmath3 , with @xmath4 a square - free positive integer .",
    "these groups , as well as their central quotients @xmath5 , are known as bianchi groups .",
    "the determination of the ( co)homology of bianchi groups , motivated in  @xcite , has a long history of case - by - case computations ( see @xcite for a list of references ) .",
    "this changed with the recently introduced technique of torsion subcomplex reduction , which provided general formulae for the farrell cohomology of the @xmath5 groups for any @xmath4  @xcite . in this article , we extend the subcomplex reduction technique to the case where the kernel of a group action is nontrivial in order to obtain the mod @xmath1 cohomology rings of the @xmath6 groups . for this purpose , we study a variant of the long exact sequence in borel cohomology .",
    "the reason why we consider only @xmath7coefficients is that for any prime @xmath8 , the lyndon  hochschild  serre spectral sequence with @xmath9coefficients associated to the central extension @xmath10 is concentrated in the horizontal axis , yielding @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , bianchi groups contain only @xmath1 and @xmath12torsion ; results for @xmath13 can be found in  @xcite .",
    "philosophically , the cohomology of the bianchi groups can be thought of as coming from two sources . since the bianchi groups act on a @xmath1dimensional retract of hyperbolic @xmath12space  @xmath14 , the bianchi groups have virtual ( co)homological dimension @xmath1 .",
    "consequently , in dimensions @xmath1 and below , many of the cohomology classes of the bianchi groups come from the topology of the quotient space and are detected with rational coefficients  @xcite ; calculations exclusively for rational coefficients have been carried out in  @xcite . above the virtual cohomological dimension ,",
    "all cohomology classes are torsion and originate from finite subgroups . in particular , one can use the equivariant spectral sequence to determine the ( co)homology of bianchi groups .",
    "results of the second author have made this precise .",
    "the article  @xcite introduced the @xmath15torsion subcomplex , and contains a proof that this subcomplex determines the homology of @xmath5 above dimension  @xmath1 ; in addition , that the homology is a direct sum of generic modules associated to the homeomorphism types of connected components of the subcomplex .    in this work",
    ", we will show how to extend the torsion subcomplex results from the projective special linear group to the linear group .",
    "the difficulty that we need to overcome is that the kernel of the action of @xmath6 on @xmath14 is nontrivial .",
    "we solve this problem by using a technique reminiscent of the long exact sequence in relative borel cohomology associated to a pair of complexes .",
    "this is the content of section [ section : e2 page ] , where we describe the @xmath16 page of the equivariant spectral sequence in terms of components of the @xmath1-torsion subcomplex .",
    "we also need to determine whether any loops in the subcomplexes are homologous in the quotient @xmath17 .",
    "this interaction is tracked by the variable @xmath18 in our calculations .",
    "the last piece of the puzzle in the determination of the mod @xmath1 cohomology of the @xmath0 bianchi groups is the rank of the second page differential .",
    "we can say a lot about this rank by individually analyzing component types of a reduced @xmath1torsion subcomplex using the cohomology ring structure over the steenrod algebra .",
    "this is the subject of section  [ the second page differential on the components of the torsion subcomplex ] .",
    "we conclude with some sample calculations .",
    "for instance , example @xmath19 in section  [ examples - section ] considers the case when @xmath20 , @xmath3 has precisely one finite ramification place over @xmath21 , and the ideal class number of the totally real number field @xmath22 is @xmath23 .",
    "these three conditions are equivalent to the quotient of the @xmath1torsion subcomplex having the shape @xmath24{iota - edgegraph.pdf}}$ ] , as worked out in  @xcite . under these assumptions , our cohomology ring has the following dimensions : @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "let @xmath27 for all absolute values of the discriminant less than @xmath28 , numerical calculations yield @xmath29 in this range , the numbers @xmath4 subject to the above dimension formula and @xmath30 are given as follows ( the betti numbers are taken from  @xcite ) .",
    "@xmath31    we add a few remarks about the approach taken in this paper .",
    "the finite subgroups we consider have no subgroups isomorphic to @xmath32 , so their cohomology is periodic of period @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the restriction map on cohomology from any finite subgroup to the central @xmath34 subgroup is onto in dimensions divisible by @xmath33 .",
    "we expect something similar for the bianchi groups we consider , since by results of quillen @xcite their mod-@xmath1 cohomology is @xmath35-isomorphic to the cohomology of the maximal abelian subgroups , here the center @xmath34 .",
    "we show this in proposition  [ prop : bianchiperiodicity ] , where we identify a class @xmath36 in dimension @xmath33 which provides the periodicity .",
    "we thank the referee for pointing out that this class @xmath36 is the second chern class of the natural representation of @xmath37 .    under these observations",
    ", one might expect that a reasonable alternative approach to calculating cohomology would come from using the lyndon  hochschild  serre spectral sequence associated to the short exact sequence @xmath10 to determine cohomology up to degree @xmath38 .",
    "unfortunately , although one can often easily determine @xmath39 and @xmath40 for this spectral sequence , calculations in an unpublished manuscript by the first author yield that in cases with discriminant as low as @xmath41 and @xmath42 , there is a non - trivial internal @xmath43 differential whose existence can only be determined by knowing @xmath44 beforehand . for this reason , an approach relying exclusively on this spectral sequence does not appear feasible .",
    "this paper grew out of an attempt to take advantage of much of what is already known about the @xmath5 bianchi groups .",
    "results in @xcite , for example , show that information about @xmath45 above the cohomological dimension resides in `` geometric '' data . specifically , for a large range of values of @xmath4 , the geometric data resides in four types of subcomplexes in the quotient @xmath17 whose multiplicity we are going to denote by @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "other calculations exist for the rational homology of @xmath17 ( @xcite , for example ) which provide values of the betti numbers @xmath30 and @xmath50 for the quotient space .",
    "our work shows that these data are almost sufficient for a full answer , and give very tight bounds on the cohomology of @xmath6 in all dimensions .",
    "we note that prior machine calculations for @xmath51 have been performed for many values of @xmath4 , but the time to complete a calculation usually increases with @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the results in this paper provide a constructive argument which can be used to complement , corroborate , and extend existing results .",
