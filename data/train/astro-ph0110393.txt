    "although the initial forays into relativistic gas dynamics @xcite and relativistic mhd @xcite were mainly stimulated by applied mathematical curiosity , astronomical observations now provide abundant incentive to consider relativistic flows in detail . in this brief summary",
    ", i shall review these developments in rough , historical order , emphasise some contemporary problems and suggest some future directions .",
    "i refer to the many excellent presentations at this workshop fordetailed discussions and more extensive bibliographies .      ever since the pioneering , vlbi observations in the early 1970 s @xcite , @xcite we have known that compact",
    ", extragalactic radio sources can expand with space velocities within one percent of the speed of light so as to create a strong `` superluminal '' illusion @xcite .",
    "the emitting features , in variable , compact radio sources , were soon associated with external and internal shock waves and the jet - like , as opposed , to spherical character of the flows was established .",
    "observations of jets at optical , x - ray and , especially @xmath0-ray energies followed and much effort is currently being applied to understanding the details of how different types of jet emit throughout the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "the general picture that has emerged [ agudo , celotti , close , georganopoulos , kovalev , mastichiadis , matzac ] is that relativistic electrons are accelerated , mainly at shock fronts , and that they emit synchrotron radiation at low frequency and inverse compton emission at high frequency , with the former providing the soft photons for the latter in low power sources and the disk ultraviolet emission supplying the soft photons in high power sources .",
    "although early , relativistic jet models were essentially gas dynamical , with the magnetic field evolving passively , it is now widely believed that jets are collimated by large - scale magnetic field [ casse , ferreira , nitta ] with a disk angular velocity vector determining the jet axis .",
    "however the details are controversial .",
    "most models of jet formation and collimation that have been published to date are non - relativistic , analytic mhd solutions where the intrinsic anisotropy of the maxwell stress tensor is ultimately responsible for the collimation .",
    "this is reasonable because , as it is generally reasoned , what is being described is a collimating , magnetic sleeve that confines an ultrarelativistic flow that emanates from the black hole and the inner disk .",
    "however , some authors have argued that the magnetic field is always primarily poloidal and any toroidal field that is generated by the rotation will quickly vanish through reconnection . at the other extreme",
    "it has been proposed that rotation dominates and the magnetic field lines behave like a coiled spring pushing the jets out along the spin axis .",
    "both components are relevant to centrifugal models where the inertia of the outflowing plasma plays a crucial role . finally , there are models where there is no long range order to the field and it is the local anisotropy associated with loops of magnetic flux that create the collimation .",
    "the stability of most of these models , particularly to non - axisymmetric modes , is only recently coming under scrutiny [ lery ] .",
    "yet another debate , and this is probably the central phenomenological question in interpreting relativistic flows , is `` what is the working substance ? '' .",
    "[ markowith , yamasaki ] .",
    "there is far too large a radiation density around the inner disk for the flows to start life as just pairs and there has to be some other carrier of momentum .",
    "one possibility , considered in some early models was the radiation itself",
    ". however , elementary kinematic considerations make it quite unlikely that large lorentz factors can be achieved .",
    "protons , whose radiative efficiency is very low , could be responsible , though it is very hard to see how they could be accelerated efficiently in a beam .",
    "in my view , the most reasaonable candidate is electromagnetic field .",
    "note , that i am only suggesting that jets start off in a predominately electromagnetic form .",
    "a quite likely sequence is that , at some finite distance from the black hole where annihilation can not keep up with production , jets metamorphose into a pair plasma .",
    "this may be where the observed @xmath0-rays are produced . at a yet greater distance , these jets",
    "should ultimately interact strongly with their surroundings as they become radio sources and decelerate . presumably , when the jet is powerful , the outflow can remain relativistic and we have an fr2 source ; when the jet is weak and decelerates to a subsonic speed , an fr1 source is formed . at this point",
    ", we are dealing with reasonably well - resolved extended radio sources and now have a much better understanding of the physical conditions in the surrounding gas .",
    "this should enable us to make more confident descriptions of radio source evolution and more quantitative estimates of the total jet powers [ blundell , manolakou , polatidis ] , both in individual sources ( where they can exceed the bolometric power of the agn ) and collectively as a contribution to the luminosity density of the universe .",
    "although jets are certainly the most dramatic , relativistic flows associated with agn , gas in the accretion disk also moves with mildly relativistic speed and general as well as special relativity must be invoked to account for the x - ray line spectroscopy - a quite dramatic vindication of the black hole model .",
    "this is possible evidence that the holes are spinning , because the prominent red wings that are sometimes observed should only be formed if the disk can approach the horizon and this onloy happens for a geometrically thin disks orbiting a rapidly spinning hole in a prograde sense @xcite .",
    "pulsars were discovered soon after there was evidence for relativistic effects in agn and it was quickly realized that they should also be ( relativistic ) electromagnetic objects @xcite@xcite .",
    "originally , the field was thought to be that of a rotating , vacuum , magnetic dipole , though it was soon realized that the magnetosphere had to contain plasma which would at least seriously modify the electromagnetic field and might have dynamical importance @xcite .",
    "a similar metamorphosis of energy from mechanical , through electromagnetic , pairs and ions is envisaged though the details of how and where these transformations occur are no less controversial than they are with agn jets despite much valiant , theoretical effort .",
    "important chandra observations of the crab nebula , and a few other plerions , have demonstrated that the presumed spherical winds actually exhibit `` jets '' , giving the lie to the assertion that disks are necessary for jet formation .",
    "( actually , they also appear to possess features that look like `` disks '' , though these are probably equatorial current sheets , like those found to be associated with the solar wind . )",
    "the association of black hole accretion disks with agn led to the ( morphological ) expectation that binary x - ray sources ( where the direct evidence for disks was stronger than in agn ) should also produce jets . the early evidence ( eg in sco - x1 )",
    "was confused , but with the discovery of the jets in ss433 @xcite [ rowell ] , ( where the jet velocity and its variation could be accurately measured ) the matter was settled . however , here , and in all other known examples to date [ fender ] , the outflow speed is only mildly relativistic in contrast to what has been found with the agn jets .",
    "indeed , there is no dynamical or kinematical objection to the jets being created by radiation pressure and as these sources are operating quite close to the eddington limit , radiation can not be ignored .",
    "these inner disks , like those associated with agn accreting close to the eddington rate , comprise radiation - dominated gas .",
    "the galactic superluminal sources @xcite , which are believed to contain black holes , also exhibit `` quasiperiodic oscillations '' , or qpos , analogous to the oscillations that have been reported from neutron star systems .",
    "the modulation is generally associated with standing modes in the relativistic accretion disk .",
    "however , the disk can only be the clock ; the x - ray emission is so hard that it must actually originate in the corona .",
    "this is additional , circumstantial evidence for a strong magnetic coupling between the disk and its surroundings and , in principle , a strong diagnostic of general relativistic disk flow .",
    "although early discussions of the nature of grbs clearly recognized the implications if they were at cosmological distances @xcite , it was nt until the batse catalog was produced that it became clear that this was probably the case and that grbs probably expanded even faster than agn jets @xcite .",
    "the inference was verified by the measurement of afterglow redshifts and the discovery of radio scintillation[downes , kobayashi , galama , sari ] .",
    "it now seems to be generally accepted that bulk lorentz factors , variously estimated as lying in the range @xmath1 , are required to avoid pair production by the escaping high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "the gamma ray burst itself is most commonly associated with the dissipation of internal shocks that form in the expanding fireball and reflect variation in the source over a relatively long timescale @xmath2",
    "s for the better studied `` long '' bursts .",
    "the afterglow , which can be traced for over year in some cases , is associated with a blast wave , initially ultrarelativistic , formed by the swept up interstellar medium .",
    "the evidence that this flow is non - spherical , ie that grbs are also jets  the observation of achromatic spectral breaks and a desire to limit the explosion energy  is improving but is not yet decisive .",
    "the study the dynamics and radiative properties of afterglows has partly recapitulated the study of agn jets , although there is now an impressively detailed phenomenological description of comprehensive observations of over 20 bursts throughout the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "although there is circumstantial evidence that the long bursts are associated with star - forming regions in galaxies , the nature of the sources is still unclear .",
    "we know less about the short bursts , though the soft gamma repeaters are probably associated with magnetars .    in most contemporary models of the non - repeating bursts ,",
    "a black hole is either formed or augmented .",
    "many of these models , specifically the collapsar models , raise fundamental questions of relativistic gas dynamics , including the question of whether or not we are dealing with a fluid at all !",
    "the afterglows raise the same questions that came up with agn concerning particle acceleration and field amplification .",
    "particles accelerated and how is field amplified ?  . from an astronomical perspective",
    ", we also want to understand the place of grbs in the scheme of advanced stellar evolution and supernova explosions as well as their potential as sources of neutrinos and gravitational radiation as well as their `` environmental impact '' .",
    "there are several other types of mildly relativistic flow that have been considered in astrophysics including accretion onto neutron stars , broad absorption line quasar outflows and , most fundamentally of all , early universe cosmology which is also an exercise in relativistic gas dynamics with a transition from radiation - dominance to gas - dominance , just like that in accretion disks !",
    "one of many satisfying features of both special and general relativity is how harmoniously they accommodate gas dynamics .",
    "the relativistic formalism emphasizes symmetry and conservation laws in a manner that is sometimes lost in the more engineering - oriented development of the non - relativistic subject .",
    "gravity can be ignored for application to jets , winds and grbs and the governing equations , derivable from setting the divergence of the mass particle current vector and the stress - energy tensor to zero , express the conservation of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "this leads to counterparts of familiar non - relativistic descriptions for i d flow , shock discontinuities and so forth . in many analyses of relativistic flows , the fluid is often taken to be isotropic and ultrarelativistic ,",
    "that is to say the pressure is dominated by radiation or high energy leptons with an internal sound ( proper ) speed of @xmath3 . in this case",
    "the effective mach number is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the proper bulk speed . in other applications ,",
    "non - relativistic protons are also present and reduce the sound speed .",
    "however , there are some serious worries as to how complete a description this really is in many of the environments where these results are applied . for example , in a pair creation region , mass will not be conserved .",
    "furthermore , momentum and energy will not be conserved in the presence of inverse compton scattering .",
    "another worry is that shear stress is usually ignored when dealing with jets while it is seen as an intrinsic part of another common astrophysical shear flow , the accretion disk .",
    "when we make 1d jet models we are implicitly assuming that jets are enclosed by narrow , turbulent , boundary layers that do not spread so that mach numbers can attain large values  over 300 in some collapsar models  and the ratio of the bulk kinetic energy to the internal energy exceeds @xmath6 .",
    "this is supposed to happen naturally with essentially no noise and internal dissipation reconverting the bulk energy to internal energy .",
    "an aerodynamicist would think this strange !",
    "high mach number jets have some unusual properties ( both non - relativistically and relativistically ) .",
    "if the fluid starts from a subsonic chamber , where it is all in causal contact , and accelerates through a pair of nozzles to form `` twin exhausts '' with mach number much larger than the reciprocal of the jet opening angle @xmath7 , ( as is thought to happen in grbs ) , then the different parts of the jet flow will fall out of causal contact .",
    "now , in the case of a grb , the jet is likely to be preceded by a relativistic blast wave propagating into the surrounding medium .",
    "initially the different elements of this blast wave will also be out of causal contact .",
    "however , as the blast wave decelerates , @xmath8 will fall to @xmath7 and transverse causal contact will be re - established .",
    "this `` hello  goodbye  hello '' behavior is thought to be responsible for the achromatic breaks in the afterglow emission and is reminiscent of inflationary cosmology !",
    "ultrarelativistic flows do have some distinctive kinematic properties which mostly derive from the fact that the 3-speed is limited to that of light .",
    "this in turn , leads to strong doppler - shifting and beaming of the emitted radiation .",
    "these effects can be extremely large and can lead to insignificant parts of the source dominating what we observe      the next most complicated class of problems involves gas dynamical flows in the presence of a passive gravitational field .",
    "a prime example is an accretion disk in orbit about a black hole .",
    "there is now a lot of interest in solving these problems using the full machinery of general relativity .",
    "for example , `` diskoseismological '' oscillation modes have been calculated and their frequencies can be made to match qpo observations .      flows where the spacetime is dynamic are far harder to analyze and numerical methods are necessary .",
    "the most pressing examples are neutron star  neutron star / black hole models of grbs .",
    "simulations have been used to determine the timescales for coalescence and , for example , to show that neutrino emission is unlikely to be very important in driving the burst .",
    "as i have already remarked , most models of relativistic jets , plerions and disks are intrinsically magnetised . in particular , we now know how magnetic field is amplified in a non - relativistic disk , through the magnetorotational instability and it is now generally agreed that disk evolution is a magnetohydrodynamic problem .",
    "similarly , jet collimation is generally argued to be due to anisotropic magnetic stress on the grounds that the maximum gas pressures allowed by x - ray observational constraints are too small to effect collimation .    in non - relativistic astrophysical mhd [ sauty ] , it is commonly assumed that the electrical conductivity is infinite , implying that the electric field vanishes in the centre of momentum frame .",
    "when this happens the flow evolves under a set of locally deterministic equations which give the partial derivatives of the velocity , density and the magnetic field with respect to time .",
    "( there is an applied mathematical nicety involving the degeneracy of the signal speeds along the field . which is probably inconsequential in practice .",
    ") note that there is no need for an equation to describe the temporal evolution of the current density as this is given by the curl of the magnetic field .",
    "the charge density can be determined after the fact from gauss law , if needed , but it has no dynamical role in the non - relativistic limit .",
    "by contrast , when we try to do the same thing in relativistic mhd , some awkward questions are raised because we can not ignore the displacement current and the charge density .",
    "maxwell s equations are evolutionary equations for @xmath9 . in the infinite conductivity limit",
    ", there is no evolutionary equation for @xmath10 .",
    "only when we introduce a finite conductivity , so that the current density is given by some form of ohm s law in the center of momentum frame , do we fix the current locally .",
    "however , when the conductivity is so large that there is insignificant electric potential difference along the magnetic field , the current flow must be determined by what happens elsewhere , in regions where there is dissipation or by the boundary conditions .",
    "there is a second possible problem with relativistic mhd that can have a large bearing on the outcome .",
    "traditionally there are three modes of wave propagation known as fast and slow magnetosonic propagation , together with the intermediate ( or alfvn ) mode .",
    "now the slow mode is determined by the sound speed in the gas .",
    "this is traditionally taken to be isotropic and ( if the gas has a high temperature ) to be @xmath11 .",
    "however , in many flows , including those around black holes , it is possible for the electrons to cool on a dynamical timescale .",
    "the particle distribution function may become highly anisotropic with repect to the ambient magnetic field . in this case the effective sound velocity along the direction of the magnetic field can become arbitrarily close to the speed of light .",
    "this , in turn affects the characteristics and has implications for the development of shock waves and the causal structure of relativistic flows .      a useful approximation for handling magnetised , relativistic flows , that simplifies the calculation , though",
    "does not remove the first of the above difficulties , is to adopt the relativistic force - free approximation , namely that @xmath12 .",
    "this immediately supplies a constitutive relation for the component of the current density resolved perpendicular to the magnetic field , @xmath13 .",
    "the parallel component must be fixed by boundary conditions , just as in the non - relativistic case . in this approximation , which is surely good for field lines which thread a black hole event horizon and quite possibly for pulsar winds ,",
    "we dispense with the velocity all together .",
    "the role of the plasma is to supply charge density and current .",
    "the invariant @xmath14 vanishes and there will generally be ample charge to keep the invariant @xmath15 positive .      increasing attention is being paid to the dynamics of radiation - dominated fluid .",
    "the prime example is the open universe .",
    "however , here the vorticity and magnetic field are thought to be quite small . by contrast , relativistic accretion disks and optically thick jets",
    "are quite likely to behave very differently .",
    "these are , by definition , shear flows in which magnetic fields grow on a dynamical timescale .",
    "however , the field may become quite inhomogeneous in a manner which will facilitate radiative transfer .",
    "in fact , photons can transfer momentum as well as energy under some circumstances .",
    "it has been made quite apparent here that the way forward is through numerical simulation [ aloy , peitz ] .",
    "impressive advances have been reported in the testing and deployment of large three ( and four ) dimensional codes with and without magnetic field and improvements in speed and memory make quite sophisticated investigations a practical proposition .",
    "the numerical study of radiation - dominated , relativistic magnetohydrodynamics is on the horizon and promises the biggest surprises as we strive to develop some understanding of what really happens to gas accreting onto a black hole . even in simple flows , breaking spherical or axisymmetry and going beyond self - similarity is producing large changes in our outlook .",
    "in addition , the capability to tackle non - linear perturbations - the only sort that observers can see - is crucial .",
    "this , is not to say that there is no further role for analytical approaches . in some sense",
    ", they become more important .",
    "this is because it is extremely hard to represent the results of multi - dimensional computations , graphically or verbally in a manner that allows one to divine general principles and predict what will happen in other flows .",
    "having a simple description of the most important features of a complex flow is immensely valuable .",
    "it is also important to distinguish numerical simulation , which aspires to reproduce an accurate representation of a flow from numerical experiments . as with much experimental physics ,",
    "a laudable goal of numerical experiments is to get so much insight that it is possible to replace them with a working model that can be used as a subunit of a larger investigation .    understanding the flow is not the end of the matter .",
    "it is important to use the fluid solution to provide a framework to discuss higher order features like the plasma physics , particle acceleration and radiative transfer .",
    "this is vital if we want to interpret the diagnostic observations of relativistic sources . carrying out these secondary studies relativistically is turning out to be no less of a numerical challenge than computing the basic flows .",
    "the observational prospects are good . on agn jets",
    ", there is an opportinity for using polarimetric observations and imaging to tell us if jets have an electromagnetic or a gas dynamical origin and for understanding what factors determine the jet power .",
    "increasingly detailed x - ray observations of sources like m87 , cygnus a and pictor a are providing excellent laboratories for determining directly , where relativistic electrons are accelerated , what is the magnetic feld geometry and how the particles are transported .",
    "temporal studies should clarify the extent to which jets can be thought of as continuous flows or a sequence of explosive outbursts .",
    "the spectacularly detailed x - ray spectroscopy that is emerging from both xmm - newton and chandra will eventually be interepreted and should define the geometry of the gas flow near to black holes and , especially , identify where the energy is dissipated .",
    "our view of plerions has been considerably enhanced by their association with soft gamma repeaters and magnetars .",
    "however there is still a lot of uncertainty in these identifications and an imperfect understanding of how a plerion changes in reponse to a burst .",
    "more coordinated observations are needed .",
    "one of the big observational challenges in studying the galactic superluminal sources is to find a `` microblazar '' - a high lorentz factor jet pointed towards us .",
    "( it is possible that the recently - discovered , super - eddington compact sources in nearby galaxies could be of this type . )",
    "if , conversely , we can persuade ourselves that these objects do not exist , then it will probably tell us something useful about jet formation .    turning to grbs",
    ", hete2 should identify some short bursts and point to a physical origin for this subclass to complement the tremendous observations of the long bursts that derive from beppo - sax and batse .",
    "the basic jet emission model involving shock fronts admits a simple , testable prediction .",
    "the kinematic velocity of the emitting feature will differ from the velocity of the emitting gas , which can be measured through the doppler shift .",
    "it would be very nice to demonstrate this in some sources .",
    "there is great need to discover the true laws of mhd which will describe how collisionless plasmas behave in practice on the largest scales as opposed to the applied mathematical idealisations on which we must rely at present .",
    "undoubtedly our best hope for understanding non - relativistic flows lies with careful analysis of the superb observations of the solar corona by the yohkoh , soho and trace spacecrafts as well as the _ in situ _ observations of the solar wind and planetary magnetospheres .",
    "we need to understand how currents flow  are they distributed or filamentary - how shocks create entropy under a wide variety of defining conditions , how much energy is dissipated in reconnection regions and in what form , how turbulent spectra develop and the connection to magnetic amplification by dynamo action .",
    "we would like to understand solar flares as a prelude to understanding the energisation of an accretion disk corona and the means of launching the solar wind which is surely relevant to the formation of jets .",
    "the best laboratory that we have for the relativistic flows that are the subject of this meeting is surely the crab nebula . here",
    "chandra and hst observations are changing our view of the pulsar wind / jet , and its termination through a strong shock front .",
    "however we still do not have an accepted determination of its speed and composition .",
    "the notion that magnetised flows generically collimate into jets even without a disk , if true , is of immediate relevance to grbs .",
    "a related question is `` how much is the character of the jet dependent upon the central compact object ? '' .",
    "we are pretty confident that the galactic superluminals are identified with black holes but sco x-1 ( and possibly , ss433 ) may derive from neutron stars .",
    "in addition the jets we observe best are formed by protostars , so a `` compact object '' is far from necessary .",
    "this is a good clue as to how relativistic jets are powered .",
    "perhaps all that is required to make a jet large relative angular velocity ( in units of the keplerian value ) .",
    "another research frontier is the ultra high energy cosmic rays .",
    "there is a good chance that , as observations continue to improve over the next few years , we will be forced to a phenomenological model of their origin which will surely involve ultrarelativistic plasma physics .",
    "there is now a large backlog of unsolved problems in fundamental theory that must be solved before we can model astrophysical , relativistic flows with confidence . for many of these ,",
    "as i have emphasized , the requisite computational tools are becoming available .",
    "perhaps the most pressing need , with the largest , general implications , is to understand how magnetic fields evolve around black holes , in the radiation or ion - dominated disks and in the magnetosphere above the hole .",
    "we will almost certainly need to perform large scale numerical simulations and will want to use these to determine the relative efficiencies for the release of energy by the hole and the disk and the connection to jets",
    ". this problem will be very hard to solve , though it is fairly well posed . in the case of an ion plasma",
    "we will want to use plasma simulations to understand better the collisionless coupling between the hot ions and the cool electrons    there are several additional , interesting formal challenges which may turn out to be relevant to interpreting the observations , such as making a theory for the radiative transfer of plasma waves in a curved spacetime , developing a relativistic theory of reconnection and reworking the theory of the mri for a relativistic disk .    as the diverse contributions to this lively workshop attest , these are only a few of the possibilities inherent in this young and exciting field .",
    "i am indebted to markos georganopoulos , axel guthmann , konstantina manolakou and alexandre markowith for their invitation to this meeting , their generous hospitality and allowing me to fulfil a lifelong ambition to visit greece .",
