    "surface muons are generated from low - energy pions which have lost their whole momentum inside the production target and stop at the target surface layer .",

    ". the collection and transport system of pions is very important for a high intensity of decay muons .",

    "this may be because most high - energy pions have a large curvature radius and are killed by the inner side of the capture solenoid in the simulation when the superconducting solenoid is not parallel to the proton momentum .",
