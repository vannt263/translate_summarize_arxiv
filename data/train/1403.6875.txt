    "exactly solvable models are always appreciated , not only because of the beauty they embody but also because of the pivotal role they can play . among the exactly solvable models known so far ,",
    "many are solved by the bethe ansatz for the wave function @xcite . a prerequisite for the consistency of this ansatz",
    "is the absence of diffraction @xcite , which was first explicitly pointed out by mcguire @xcite , and is formally characterized by the yang - baxter equation @xcite .",
    "recently , in an investigation motivated by atomic physics , the present authors discovered that a two - particle lattice model , whose continuum counterpart was previously claimed to be diffractive by mcguire @xcite , has eigenstates in the bethe ansatz form although they do not span the whole hilbert space @xcite .",
    "the model is very simple  it consists of two interacting identical bosons moving on a one - dimensional _ infinite _ lattice with a single site defect .",
    "the model possesses a reflection symmetry ( parity ) and the states odd under parity conform to the bethe ansatz .",
    "its original purpose was to investigate how the competition or cooperation between the interaction and the defect potential will affect the formation of bound states in the system , as interesting consequences are known in a similar object , i.e. , the negative hydrogen ion h@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the model can exhibit two kinds of exotic bound state , i.e. , the bound state in the continuum @xcite and the bound state at threshold @xcite .",
    "it was convenient to consider the model on the infinite line because the bound state can be unambiguously discerned from the extended states belonging to the continuous spectrum .",
    "the yang - baxter relation is then sufficient to prove the validity of the bethe ansatz in the odd subspace @xcite .",
    "however , the situation is different on a finite lattice @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions impose now restrictions on the allowed momenta and as the impurity potential generates backscattered waves which in all known cases inevitably spoil integrability , it was not clear whether meaningful bethe ansatz equations can be derived to determine the discrete spectrum and if so , whether their solutions span the full subspace with odd parity .",
    "we shall address these questions in the following .",
    "both can be answered in the affirmative for odd lattice size @xmath1 and periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , the framework of the bethe ansatz has to be generalized to incorporate the non - trivial backscattering at the impurity . the standard approach",
    "( see e.g. @xcite ) defines the @xmath2-matrix as a relation between local amplitudes , whereas in our case the amplitudes have to be defined in a non - local way .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ defmodel ] we define the model and outline the formalism of the generalized bethe ansatz .",
    "we show that it allows for a natural inclusion of the reflection ( parity ) symmetry and thus explains at the same time the integrability of the odd sector and the failure of the ansatz in the even sector .",
    "the representation of periodic boundary conditions in the formalism is discussed in some detail .",
    "we derive the bethe ansatz equations for this case .",
    "the proof that their solutions span indeed the whole space is given in the appendix .",
    "the partial solvability of this model contradicts common lore about the possibility to use the bethe ansatz for systems with impurities which are neither located at the edges @xcite nor have fine - tuned features which effectively remove the backscattering @xcite . in the present case , our primary evidence comes from numerical data obtained by exact diagonalization .",
    "this is the subject of sec .",
    "[ numerics ] . here",
    "we study both open and periodic boundary conditions with three different methods to corroborate the fact that the odd sector is always integrable while the even sector is not .",
    "in particular , the bethe ansatz checking method in sec .  [ algorithm ] allows us to confirm that all the eigenstates in the odd subspace have the bethe form . on the other hand , the even sector exhibits eigenstates which are composed of only a few fourier components and thus resemble bethe states .",
    "these `` weakly diffractive '' states are presented in sec .",

    "the one - dimensional elastic scattering between the particles ( @xmath4 ) leaves the momenta pairwise invariant but the impurity potential @xmath5 generates reflected waves with opposite momentum .",

    "similar to systems with boundary potentials , only the absolute values of @xmath83 are good quantum numbers .",
    "to analyze the eigenstates properly , the bethe ansatz for spinless particles with scalar scattering phases has to be generalized by the introduction of non - commutative scattering matrices and non - local amplitudes .",

    "only odd - parity states conform to the bethe ansatz , whereas the even - parity states show diffraction and avoided crossings , a hallmark of non - integrable systems .",
    "we have derived the generalized bethe ansatz equations and proven that their solutions span the complete odd subspace for periodic boundary conditions .",
    "moreover we have studied the model numerically for periodic and open boundary conditions by using a novel technique to check for the presence of non - diffractive states after exact diagonalization .",
    "this technique is numerically exact and very general .",
    "it can be used in many situations if one suspects that a model may be ( fully or partially ) diffractionless but can not be treated analytically .",
    "we have used the method to confirm full integrability in a variant of our model introduced by longhi and della valle @xcite  the infinite lattice is replaced by a semi - infinite one and the impurity sits at the end .",
    "putting open boundary conditions at the other end , we have studied this system with the checking algorithm and find that all states have the bethe form .",
    "this comes not unexpected , as many boundary potentials do not destroy integrability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we have analyzed the numerically obtained eigenstates in both sectors via fourier transform to extract the momentum distribution .",
    "this gives another ( approximate ) criterion to test whether a given state is close to the bethe ansatz .",
    "we confirm in this way the integrable nature of the odd sector . in the even sector",
    ", another unexpected phenomenon appears : some of the states show a momentum distribution with eight strong peaks , very similar to what one would expect for a state in bethe form .",
    "the peaks are located near @xmath216 , where the generalized yang - baxter relation is satisfied also in the even sector .",
    "now the values @xmath216 are forbidden within the bethe ansatz formalism and we are confronted with a novel object : eigenstates which have `` almost '' the bethe form and can therefore be called `` weakly '' diffractive .",
    "interestingly , the standard approach employing local amplitudes does not show this connection between a weakly violated yang - baxter relation and weakly diffractive states , because the former is strongly violated for arbitrary momenta",
    ".    a natural direction of further research would be the question whether systems with an integrable sector due to the presence of a non - local symmetry ( in our case space inversion with respect to the impurity site ) exist also for more than two particles .",

    "<S> we investigate the non - integrable even sector numerically and find a class of states which have almost the bethe ansatz form . </S>",
    "<S> these weakly diffractive states correspond to a weak violation of the non - local yang - baxter relation which is satisfied in the odd sector . </S>",
    "<S> we bring up a method based on the prony algorithm to check whether a numerically obtained wave function is in the bethe form or not , and if so , to extract parameters from it . </S>",
    "<S> this technique is applicable to a wide variety of other lattice models .    </S>",
