    "the one - band hubbard hamiltonian is the simplest lattice model for studying strongly correlated electrons  @xcite .",
    "it is widely studied , especially in its two - dimensional version , as a model for the high-@xmath0 superconducting cuprates . among the various methods used for studying the hubbard model ,",
    "the quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) methods have shown to be powerful tools , both at zero and finite temperatures .",
    "the studies of the hubbard model at zero temperature include several qmc methods , namely , the variational ( vmc )  @xcite , the fixed - node diffusion ( dmc )  @xcite , and the constrained path qmc ( cpmc )  @xcite .",
    "from these zero temperature methods , only cpmc does not depend crucially on the variational wave function .",
    "actually , the simple free - electron - like wave functions are rather generally found to be better importance functions for cpmc than the unrestricted hartree - fock wave functions  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "cpmc is limited to smaller lattice sizes than vmc .",
    "it can , however , give accurate results for system sizes far beyond the limits of exact diagonalizations  @xcite or the subspace techniques such as stochastic diagonalization  @xcite . also the finite temperature qmc simulations can be used to obtain ground state properties if the temperature used is low enough  @xcite .",
    "this approach is , however , mainly applicable for half - filled systems due to the problems related to the negative weights of the configurations , i.e. , the fermion sign problem .",
    "compared to the other approaches , the vmc methods are very potent for studying larger system sizes . the computational cost of the vmc method is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than of the more sophisticated qmc methods .",
    "the vmc method is basically free from any methodological problems such as the fermion sign problem .",
    "there is , however , one very serious limitation in the vmc approach .",
    "this is related to the ultimate connection of the method to the many - body wave function itself .",
    "the form of the wave function is an input to the vmc simulations , and choosing the form requires human creativity and insight into the problem . due to this , vmc can hardly be called a reliable `` black - box '' simulation method .",
    "however , the recent advancements in the optimization of the variational wave functions  @xcite combined with the enormous increase in computing power indicate a possibility of having considerably more flexible vmc wave functions and making the vmc simulations less `` human - biased '' .    the crucial part of the vmc simulation is to locate the optimal values of the free parameters in the many - body wave function .",
    "an efficient optimization method allows one to have more variational parameters and thus a more flexible form of the wave function and saves computer time . in this paper",
    ", we show that the optimization method called the stochastic gradient approximation ( sga )  @xcite suits very well for the vmc also in the case of lattice hamiltonians .",
    "we have previously used it for continuum models , mainly quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "the goal in the vmc optimization is to minimize the cost function @xmath1 where configuration @xmath2 contains the coordinates of the simulated particles at @xmath3th step of a random sequence , @xmath4 represents the vector of @xmath5 parameters to be optimized , and @xmath6 is the `` local '' version of the cost function of a configuration @xmath7 and @xmath8",
    ". one can formulate the vmc optimization problem approximately as a `` standard '' optimization problem by taking a finite but large @xmath9 in the cost function above .",
    "one can then use the resulting approximation of the function as a deterministic function during the optimization . doing this ,",
    "one approximates the whole distribution of @xmath7s by a finite set , and more importantly , one forgets the @xmath8 dependence of @xmath7 .",
    "to some extent this error can be corrected by weighting the configurations by factors that depend on the change of the probability of the configuration in question .    in the sga optimization method",
    "such truncation is not done . in sga , the optimal parameter vector @xmath10 , defined so that @xmath11 is found by changing the parameters @xmath8 to the direction of the unbiased stochastic approximation of the negative gradient , i.e. , @xmath12 .",
    "the approximate gradient @xmath13 is not zero even for the optimal parameters , but the average of it over configurations @xmath7 vanishes . due to this",
    ", the stochastic simulation should include damping so that it actually converges . without damping ,",
    "the simulation would end up in oscillating around the optimal parameters .",
    "the damping should , however , be so slow that the simulation is able to reach the optimal parameters .",
    "a more detailed formulation of the sga method for vmc is given in sec .",
    "[ method ] .",
    "we use the two - dimensional hubbard model given by the hamiltonian @xmath14 where @xmath15 stands for nearest neighbors , @xmath16 ( @xmath17 ) creates ( destroys ) an electron with spin @xmath18 at site @xmath19 of the square lattice , and @xmath20 .",
    "the electrons at the same site interact with strength @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the hopping parameter .",
    "we use @xmath22 as the energy scale , and set @xmath23 .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions are used for both space directions .",
    "this choice of boundary conditions leads to non - interacting single particle states that are plane - waves @xmath24 with energy @xmath25 .",
    "a commonly used variational wave function for the hubbard model is the gutzwiller wave function  @xcite @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the number of doubly occupied sites , @xmath28 is the only variational parameter , and @xmath29 is the many - body wave function for the non - interacting ground state . in this case , it is made of the plane - waves discussed above , with the * k * values chosen to minimize the energy .",
    "the motivation for this wave function is that the gutzwiller factor reduces the probability to find electrons on the same site and reduces the average interaction energy .",
    "this is done , of course , with a cost of higher kinetic energy .",
    "it is also possible to correlate electrons that are not on the same site by constructing a gutzwiller - type wave function @xmath30 where the @xmath31 s are parameters and the @xmath32 s measure the number of nearest ( and next nearest ) neighbor electrons with various spin configurations , see fig  [ confs ] . for more details .",
    "we calculate the energy using the standard metropolis algorithm ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite for more details and ref .",
    "@xcite for a modified algorithm ) , giving the estimate for the energy as @xmath33 , where the local energy is defined as @xmath34 and the average in the calculation of @xmath35 is over configurations @xmath7 distributed according to probability distribution @xmath36 one can also define a modified version of @xmath18 , namely , @xmath37 which gives the root - mean - square distance of the local energy from the target energy @xmath38 .",
    "the deviation @xmath39 is particularly useful in the optimization of the wave function .",
    "the sga optimization method involves stochastic simulation in two spaces : the configuration and the parameter space .",
    "these spaces are coupled via the parameter vector . in the configuration space ,",
    "a set of @xmath40 configurations @xmath41 is sampled from a distribution @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the current parameter vector . when the parameters are changed , the set of configurations follow this change because the new sampling distribution depends on the new parameters . in practice ,",
    "the set of configurations is found by the metropolis algorithm . in the parameter space , the parameters at iteration @xmath44 are obtained from the previous ones by the formula : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a scaling factor of the step length .",
    "the scaling factor has an important role in averaging out the fluctuations in the approximate gradient , ensuring the convergence . on the other hand ,",
    "too small a value of @xmath47 would damp the simulation too much .",
    "these rules can be formulated mathematically as : @xmath48 there is a simple interpretation for these conditions .",
    "the sum of @xmath49 should be finite to dissipate the cumulative error given by the noise in the approximate gradient and the sum of @xmath47 should diverge , because otherwise the maximum distance from the initial parameters would be limited .",
    "if one uses a formula @xmath50 , one should have @xmath51 .",
    "the choice of @xmath52 , which is the maximally damped case , leads to a formula similar to the recursive calculation of a mean : @xmath53 .    in eq .",
    "( [ sga_formula ] ) , the approximate gradient is calculated using the set of @xmath40 configurations .",
    "there are several possibilities for the cost function @xmath6 . for the energy minimization ,",
    "the cost function is simply the mean of the local energies over the set of configurations : @xmath54 and for the variance minimization one has @xmath55 . in the variance minimization",
    ", one can also use a target energy @xmath38 instead of @xmath56 .",
    "this leads to the minimization of the function @xmath39 above .    in the original implementation of sga as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , the gradient in eq .",
    "( [ sga_formula ] ) was the most difficult task and was calculated by using a finite - difference formulation . in this case , one should note that the configurations are distributed according to @xmath42 and _ not _ according to @xmath57 , where @xmath58 represents a small change .",
    "thus in the energy minimization , the finite - difference points are weighted as @xmath59 \\ , \\label{fd}\\ ] ] where the points @xmath60 are distributed according to @xmath42 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the ` weights ' @xmath63 of the local functions are very close to unity , because @xmath58 is only a small change .",
    "it is , however , possible to calculate the gradient also analytically . in ref .",
    "@xcite , lin _ et al .",
    "_ have shown that in the case of real wave function and energy minimization , the derivative of the energy @xmath64 with respect to a variational parameter @xmath65 is simply @xmath66 where the average @xmath15 is over the whole metropolis simulation  @xcite .",
    "one can implement this simple formula also for the sga algorithm , with the small modification that the average is taken over only the current set of @xmath40 configurations .",
    "one should also note that the finite - difference formulation required calculation of the local energy with several parameters , whereas only a single evaluation is needed ( for each configuration ) if the analytic formula is used .",
    "in this work , we have used the both schemes discussed above for the calculation of the gradient .",
    "first , we will consider the wave function with correlation only between electrons on the same site , and thus only one free parameter @xmath28 . in fig .",
    "[ es_g ] , the energy and the deviations of the local energy @xmath18 and @xmath67 are plotted as a function of the gutzwiller parameter @xmath28 .",
    "the system consists of @xmath68 electrons on a @xmath69 lattice with @xmath70 .",
    "one can see that the minimum of the total energy is located at @xmath71 , and the minima of @xmath18 and @xmath67 are at @xmath72 .",
    "the energy as a function of @xmath28 is in a good agreement with fig .  2 . of ref",
    "@xcite . the predicted value of @xmath28 resulting from the minimization of energy in ref .",
    "@xcite is slightly higher , around @xmath73 .",
    "the statistical error in the energies is too large in order to locate the optimal value of @xmath28 with accuracy better than @xmath74 .",
    "next , the sga optimization method is used to locate the optimal values of @xmath28 , with energy and @xmath67 as the cost functions . in fig .",
    "[ g_i ] , the gutzwiller parameter @xmath31 is plotted as a function of the sga optimization step @xmath19 for both energy and variance minimizations for the same system parameters as above .",
    "we have calculated the gradient using the original , finite - difference formulation .",
    "the simulations converge to @xmath73 in the case of energy minimization , and to @xmath75 in the optimization of @xmath39 with the target energy @xmath76 .",
    "both parameter values are in a good agreement with the independent simulations presented above , and with the estimate of the optimal value of ref .",
    "one can also see that around 1000 steps are enough to estimate the optimal parameter values with a reasonable accuracy .",
    "the computational task of this is smaller than of one independent simulation presented in fig .",
    "[ es_g ] for a single value of @xmath28 . on the other hand",
    ", it seems that the accuracy of the optimal parameters found by sga is one order of magnitude higher than in using the polynomial fit to the independent points .",
    "we have performed several simulations starting from different values of @xmath77 . in every case , the performance of sga is similar to those shown in fig .",
    "[ g_i ] .",
    "[ g_in ] shows the first 200 values of the gutzwiller parameter @xmath31 for the simulation using the analytic derivative of eq .",
    "( [ anaa ] ) .",
    "this simulation converges also very accurately to the optimal value found above .",
    "the most important feature are that the fluctuations in the value of @xmath28 during the optimization process is much smaller than in the simulation where the finite - difference formula was used .",
    "this leads to a faster convergence .    to summarize",
    ", the performance of the sga method has been found very satisfactory in finding the optimal parameter of the simple single - parameter gutzwiller wave function .",
    "this is especially true in the case where the gradient is calculated analytically .",
    "next , we will consider the generalized gutzwiller wave function , defined in eq  ( [ geng ] ) .",
    "we consider only the generalization with 4 parameters related to typical configurations shown in fig  [ confs ] .",
    "the aim of these parameters is to capture partially the missing correlations .",
    "the generalization made to the gutzwiller wave function is bosonic in the sense that it does not change the nodal structure of the one - parameter gutzwiller wave function .",
    "the energy gain of this extra correlation could directly be compared to the energy of the fixed - node dmc simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite as the nodal structure used there is also given by the simple gutzwiller wave function .",
    "this dmc energy is lower than the corresponding vmc energy by @xmath78 units .",
    "one should note that in the lattice formulation of dmc , unlike in the continuum formulation , the energy depends also on the bosonic correlation factor which does not change the nodes .",
    "this dependence is much smaller than the dependence of the vmc energy on @xmath28 .",
    "there are also correlations that change the nodal structure , and the estimate for the importance of these can be estimated from the cpmc energy which is lower than the vmc energy by more than 6 units  @xcite .",
    "we have optimized the 4 free parameters of the generalized gutzwiller wave function using the sga and the analytic formulation of the gradient .",
    "the latter choice is due to better results in the one - parameter case .",
    "one should note that setting the parameter @xmath79 and @xmath80 one obtains the simple gutzwiller wave function .",
    "we have again studied @xmath68 electrons on a @xmath69 lattice with @xmath70 as above .",
    "the optimization of the energy leads to a reduced on - site correlation factor of @xmath81 .",
    "the other parameters are @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "the smaller value of @xmath84 does not cost as much kinetic energy in this case as in the case of a simple gutzwiller wave function , because the values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 are also smaller than one .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the optimal value of @xmath84 found here with the optimal @xmath87 of the simple gutzwiller wave function determined from the @xmath28 dependence of the dmc energy  @xcite .",
    "the optimization converges again in few hundred steps , in similar fashion as shown in fig .",
    "[ g_in ] .    the energy calculated with the optimal parameters",
    "is presented in the table  [ t2 ] with corresponding one - parameter vmc , dmc , and cpmc results .",
    "one can see that the generalization of the gutzwiller wave function is able to lower the energy by 1.1 units , which is less than half of the difference to the dmc energy .",
    "the cpmc energy is still around 5 units lower in energy .",
    "there are still important ingredients missing from the variational wave function .",
    "possible extensions are three- and higher - particle correlation factors , modified single - particle states , and multiple - determinant wave functions",
    ". the good performance of the sga method combined with the simple calculation of the energy gradient could be extremely useful in the studies exploring these directions .",
    "we have shown that the sga optimization method finds the optimal values of the gutzwiller wave function parameter in a reliable and efficient fashion .",
    "the computational cost of the optimization process is comparable to a single calculation of the expectation values with a fixed parameter value .",
    "the good performance is very important particularly if a variational wave function with several parameters is used . due to this , sga is very useful in finding more accurate wave functions for the hubbard model .",
