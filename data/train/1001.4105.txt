    "in past decade significant attention has been given to evaluation of the lateral force between corrugated surfaces ( for example see ref .   and references there - in ) .",
    "in an earlier work we calculated the contribution of the next - to - leading order to the lateral casimir force between two corrugated semi - transparent @xmath0-function plates interacting with a scalar field  @xcite , and the leading order contribution for the case of two concentric semi - transparent corrugated cylinders@xcite using the multiple scattering formalism ( see ref .   and references there - in ) .",
    "we observed that including the next - to - leading order contribution significantly reduced the deviation from the exact result in the case of weak coupling .",
    "comparison with experiments requires the analogous calculation for the electromagnetic case .",
    "here we present preliminary results of our ongoing work on the evaluation of the lateral lifshitz force between two corrugated dielectric ( non - magnetic ) slabs of finite thickness interacting through the electromagnetic field ( see fig .",

    "the lateral casimir force between corrugated conductors was evaluated by emig et al@xcite .",
    "in our situation this is achieved by taking the dieletric constants @xmath1 .",
