    "the earliest application of stochastic control theory to finance was merton s portfolio optimization problem which is formulated as follows .",
    "an investor has a positive capital and access to the market where he can freely buy and sale two assets : a share and a bond .",
    "he can also consume arbitrary part of his wealth . at any time the investor decides which proportion of his wealth to invest in risky asset and which part of his capital to consume .",
    "the purpose is to find proportion of wealth and consumption rate which maximizes investor s performance criterion .",
    "this problem has a well known solution . for more details",
    "see e.g. @xcite and also section [ sec:1 ] .    in this work",
    "we modify merton s portfolio optimization problem .",
    "namely , we assume that our investor has no access to a bank account but is endowed with a one unit of an indivisible financial asset which he can sell at any time . by indivisible asset",
    "we mean the asset which investor can not divide and sale only just part of it .",
    "it can be for example a house , an apartment , a work of art , a car or simply one unit of share .",
    "the money received from the sale of this asset is immediately invested .",
    "the aim is to find the time to sale the indivisible asset and the consumption rate which maximizes the investor s performance functional .",
    "it turns out that the problem can be reduced to a one dimensional differential equation with a boundary conditions .",
    "however , if we add additional financial assets the problem becomes multidimensional and much harder to solve .",
    "investor problems are investigated in many particular cases . typically , see e.g. ksendal and sulem @xcite and original paper by merton @xcite , one is able to find explicite solution to the hjb equation",
    ". in our case we are only able to find numerically solution assuming its smoothness .",
    "the problem if given hjb equation has a smooth solution or if the value function is smooth , has been only solved under the uniform ellipticity condition see e.g. @xcite , p. 165 , p. 171 , and references therein and @xcite ,",
    ", for parabolic case . unfortunately , our problem fails to be uniformly elliptic .",
    "the problem of optimal selling was also formulated and studied in @xcite .",
    "the authors considered an investor with power utility who owns a single unit of an indivisible asset and who wishes to choose the optimum time to sell this asset .",
    "they showed that the optimal strategy is to sell the indivisible asset the first time that its value exceeds a certain proportion of the investor s wealth .",
    "let @xmath0 be a filtered probability space .",
    "define @xmath1 as the wealth process of the investor . without any loss of generality",
    "we assume that the consumption rate is of the form @xmath2 , where the @xmath3-adapted process @xmath4 will be called the consumption",
    ". then @xmath5 changes according to the stochastic differential equation @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are constants and @xmath9 is a brownian motion .",
    "let @xmath10 and the rate @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12 the objective is to find a consumption @xmath13 such that @xmath14 where @xmath15,\\ ] ] and the supremum is taken over all admissible strategies @xmath16 .",
    "we call @xmath17 the value function and interpret @xmath18 as expected value of investor s consumption rate discounted at rate @xmath11 .",
    "this classical merton s problem has a well known solution , see e.g. @xcite , p. 168 .",
    "namely , @xmath19 where @xmath20^{\\alpha-1}.\\ ] ] assumption guarantees that the constant @xmath21 is well defined .",
    "assume now that our investor is additionally endowed with a one unit of an indivisible asset .",
    "the value of this asset is given by the equation @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 are constants and @xmath25 is an independent of @xmath26 one - dimensional brownian motion .",
    "the investor can sale the indivisible asset at arbitrary time @xmath27 and must immediately invest the money received from this sale in the risky asset .",
    "we assume that after the indivisible asset is sold the agent consumes his capital in an optimal fashion .",
    "it means that investor behaves in accordance with solution to the merton portfolio optimization problem on interval @xmath28 with initial value @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is value of investor s wealth process immediately prior to the sale of the indivisible asset .",
    "the aim is to find a stopping time @xmath31 and a consumption @xmath13 such that @xmath32 where @xmath33,\\ ] ] @xmath21 is given by and the supremum is taken over all admissible @xmath34 and @xmath16 .",
    "we interpret @xmath35 as the expected value of investor s consumption rate discounted at rate @xmath11 and increased by premium for sale of the indivisble asset at time @xmath34 .",
    "note that if @xmath36 , then the problem has a trivial solution .",
    "namely , assume that the time to sale indivisible asset is of the form @xmath37",

    "it is always better to postpone the decision to sell .",
