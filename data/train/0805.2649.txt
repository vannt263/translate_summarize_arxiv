    "the calcium di - silicide , casi@xmath0 , has a rhombohedral crystal structure at the ambient pressure . in this layered structure",
    ", superconductivity does not appear down to 0.03k.@xcite in a high pressure phase of the @xmath2-thsi@xmath0 type structure , which is tetragonal , casi@xmath0 is known to become a superconductor with the superconducting transition temperature @xmath3k.@xcite at the pressure of @xmath4 10gpa , casi@xmath0 in the rhombohedral structure undergoes a structural phase transformation into another trigonal structure ( phase iii ) and superconductivity appears with @xmath1 rising up to about 3k.@xcite in this structure , silicon atoms form corrugated honeycomb networks . between two si honeycomb planes , ca atoms are intercalated , forming another plane of a triangular lattice .",
    "each ca atom locates just above the center of one corrugated hexagon formed by six si atoms in the adjacent si plane .",
    "if the pressure increases up to @xmath415gpa , another phase transformation takes place ( phase iv ) and the corrugated si planes become nearly flat .",
    "this phase is called phase iv .",
    "the atomic structure of phase iv is rather close to the alb@xmath0 structure , which has perfectly flat silicon planes .",
    "since corrugation remains in phase iv , it is sometimes called the alb@xmath0-like structure.@xcite in this structure , @xmath1 further rises up to around 14k , which is the highest record in casi@xmath0 . here , we note that before these experimental findings , the structural transition from the trigonal structure to the alb@xmath0 structure has been predicted theoretically by one of the authors of this study and his coworkers.@xcite    the superconductivity in the alb@xmath0 structure attracted much attention after finding of a high - temperature superconductor . mgb@xmath0,@xcite as for casi@xmath0 , theoretical studies were done in low - pressure phases.@xcite satta _",
    "considered possibility of the alb@xmath0 structure in a high pressure condition , but they could not find this structure with fixed cell parameters.@xcite the electron - phonon interaction and the superconducting transition temperature were rarely estimated theoretically.@xcite thus , casi@xmath0 has not been studied so often in the literature compared with mgb@xmath0 .",
    "this another superconductor , however , has its own interest and importance .",
    "this is because casi@xmath0 provides us with an ideal testing ground on which we can compare several polymorphs showing superconductivity .",
    "some of these polymorphs resemble each other , but the superconducting transition temperature @xmath1 changes its value when the structural phase transition takes place .",
    "if we could find a key factor determining the change of @xmath1 with the structural phase transition , it would help us to understand this superconducting zintl - phase compound .",
    "the purpose of the present study is to clarify the nature of casi@xmath0 in high pressure phases above 10gpa . using the first - principles calculations , we did the optimization of the atomic structures in casi@xmath0 at high pressures .",
    "we obtained an indication of the pressure - induced phase transition from the known trigonal structure to another high - pressure phase with the alb@xmath0 structure .",
    "then we studied the electronic structures , the phonon dispersion relations , and the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "those results were compared with those of mgb@xmath0 .",
    "we estimated the superconducting transition temperature by means of the strong - coupling theory using the electron - phonon coupling constants obtained by the first - principles calculations .",
    "our results tell us that casi@xmath0 undergoes a structural phase transformation to the phase of the alb@xmath0 structure and that the new phase is expected to be a superconducting phase with much higher transition temperature than that of the trigonal structure phase .",
    "in this study , we consider the pressure range of @xmath5gpa . for the structural optimization , we started simulations from lattices whose unit cell contain one ca atom and two si atoms and without any symmetry requirements .",
    "the space - group of the trigonal lattices of casi@xmath0 is @xmath6 and that of alb@xmath0 structure is @xmath7 .",
    "the wyckoff position of the calcium atom at the @xmath8 site of @xmath6 is given by @xmath9 , while those of two silicon atoms are @xmath10 and @xmath11 with the internal parameter @xmath12 .",
    "when @xmath13 , the structure becomes identical to the alb@xmath0 structure .",
    "for the determination of the electronic structure , we utilized the density - functional theory@xcite in the generalized gradient approximation @xcite with the ultra - soft pseudopotentials for the atomic potential.@xcite the wave functions and the electronic charge density are expanded in the plane - wave basis .",
    "for the pseudopotentials , 3s , 3p and 4s electrons of the calcium atom are treated as the valence electrons , and for silicon atom 3s and 3p electrons are used .",
    "calculations are performed by the use of software package , the quantum espresso.@xcite    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tabtc ]",
    "in this study , we found that the alb@xmath0 structure appears as the high - pressure phase of casi@xmath0 , and the enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature , @xmath1 , is expected in the alb@xmath0 phase .",
    "the enhancement of @xmath1 is due to the enhancement in the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "if we assume that casi@xmath0 has the phonon - mediated superconductivity , the e@xmath14 and b@xmath15 phonon modes play an important role in the enhancement of @xmath1 through the transformation from the structure with corrugated si plane to the structure with the flat one .",
