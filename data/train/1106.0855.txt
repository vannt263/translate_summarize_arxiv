    "imagine the following situation .",
    "you are a manufacturer of antennas . in order to save power",
    ", your antennas should communicate along a wedge - shape area , that is , an angular and practically infinite section of certain angle @xmath1 whose apex is the antenna .",
    "the smaller the angle is the better it is in terms of power saving .",
    "you are supposed to build many copies of these antennas to be used in various different communication networks . you know nothing about the future positioning of the antennas and you want them to be generic in the sense that they will fit to any possible finite set of locations .",
    "when installed , each antenna may be directed to an arbitrary direction that    -directional antennas and their ( connected ) communication graph.,width=264 ]    will stay fixed forever .",
    "therefore , you wish to find the minimum @xmath10 so that no matter what finite set @xmath11 of locations of the antennas is given , one can always install the antennas and direct them so that they can communicate with each other .",
    "this is to say that the _ communication graph _ of the antennas should be a connected graph .",
    "the communication graph is the graph whose vertex set is the set @xmath11 and two vertices ( antennas ) are connected by an edge if the corresponding two antennas can directly communicate with each other , that is , each is within the transmission - reception wedge of the other ( see figure  [ fig : antennas ] for an illustration ) .",
    "this problem was formulated by carmi , katz , lotker , and rosn  @xcite , who also found the optimal @xmath1 which is @xmath2 ( a different model of a _ directed _ communication graph of directional antennas of bounded transmission range was studied in  @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide a much simpler and more elegant proof of this result .",
    "we also improve on the result in  @xcite by obtaining a much simpler connected communication graph for @xmath2 whose diameter is at most @xmath12 .",
    "our graph in fact consists of a path of length @xmath13 while every other vertex is connected by an edge to one of the three vertices of the path .    in order to state our result and bring the proof we now formalize some of the notions above",
    ".    given two rays @xmath14 and @xmath15 with a common apex in the plane , we denote by @xmath16 the closed convex part of the plane bounded by @xmath14 and @xmath15 . for three noncollinear points in the plane @xmath17",
    "we denote by @xmath18 the wedge @xmath19 , whose apex is the point @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath18 is a wedge of angle @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 be @xmath23 wedges with pairwise distinct apexes .",
    "the _ wedge - graph _ of @xmath22 is by definition the graph whose vertices correspond to the apexes @xmath24 of @xmath25 , respectively , where two apexes @xmath26 and @xmath27 are joined by an edge iff @xmath28 and @xmath29 .    using this terminology",
    "we wish to prove the following theorem whose first part was proved by carmi _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite .",
    "[ theorem : main ] let @xmath11 be a set of @xmath23 points in general position in the plane and let @xmath30 be the number of vertices of the convex hull of @xmath11 .",
    "one can always find in @xmath31-time @xmath23 wedges of angle @xmath32 whose apexes are the @xmath23 points of @xmath11 such that the wedge - graph with respect to these wedges is connected .",
    "moreover , we can find wedges so that the wedge graph consists of a path of length @xmath13 and each of the other vertices in the graph is connected by an edge to one of the three vertices of the path .",
    "the angle @xmath32 in theorem  [ theorem : main ] is best possible , as shown in @xcite . indeed , for any @xmath33 one can not create a connected communication graph for a set of @xmath1-directional antennas that are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and on one of its edges .",
    "we note that the result in theorem [ theorem : main ] is optimal in the sense that it is not always possible to find an assignment of wedges to the points so that the wedge graph consists of less than three vertices the union of neighbors of which is the entire set of vertices of the graph . to see this consider a set of points evenly distributed on a circle .",
    "notice that if each wedge is of angle @xmath34 , then in any wedge graph each vertex is a neighbor of at most one third of the vertices .",
    "our main tool in proving theorem  [ theorem : main ] is a basic geometric lemma that we call the `` ice - cream lemma '' .",
    "suppose that we put one scoop of ice - cream in a very large 2-dimensional cone , such that the ice - cream touches each side of the cone at a single point .",
    "the distances from these points to the apex of the cone are not necessarily equal .",
    "however , we show that there is always a way of putting the ice - cream in the cone such that they are equal . more formally , we prove :    [ lemma : ice ] let @xmath4 be a compact convex set in the plane and fix @xmath5 .",
    "there exist a point @xmath6 in the plane and two rays , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , emanating from @xmath6 and touching @xmath4 at two _ single points _",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 , respectively , that satisfy @xmath9 and the angle bounded by @xmath35 and @xmath14 is @xmath1 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : ice - cream ] for an illustration .",
    "the requirement in lemma  [ lemma : ice ] that the two rays touch @xmath4 at _ single _ points will be crucial in our proof of theorem  [ theorem : main ] .    at a first glance",
    "the statement in lemma  [ lemma : ice ] probably looks very intuitive and it may seem that it should follow directly from a simple mean - value - theorem argument . however , this is not quite the case .",
    "although the proof ( we will give two different proofs ) indeed uses a continuity argument it is not the most trivial one .",
    "the reader is encouraged to spend few minutes trying to come up with a simple argument just to get the feeling of lemma  [ lemma : ice ] before continuing further .    because the proof of lemma  [ lemma : ice ] is completely independent of theorem  [ theorem : main ] and of its proof ,",
    "we first show , in the next section , how to prove theorem  [ theorem : main ] using lemma [ lemma : ice ] .",
    "we postpone the two proofs of the ice - cream lemma to the last section .",
    "let @xmath11 be a set of @xmath23 points in general position in the plane .",
    "we denote the convex hull of @xmath11 by @xmath36 , and recall that it can be computed in @xmath37 time  @xcite .",
    "call two vertices of @xmath36 a _ good pair _ if there are a point @xmath6 and two rays @xmath38 emanating from it creating an angle of @xmath32 such that @xmath39 , @xmath9 , and @xmath40 .",
    "note that given @xmath36 and two vertices of it @xmath41 , we can check in constant time whether @xmath41 is a good pair .",
    "indeed there are exactly two points that form an equilateral triangle with @xmath41 , and for each of these two possible locations of @xmath6 , we only need to check whether the neighbors of @xmath7 and @xmath8 in @xmath36 lie in @xmath42 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : ice ] guarantees that @xmath36 has a good pair .",
    "next we describe an efficient way to find such a good pair .",
    "suppose that @xmath41 is a good pair .",
    "observe that there are two other rays that form an angle of measure @xmath43 , contain @xmath36 in their wedge , and such that one of them contains an edge of @xmath36 that is adjacent to @xmath7 or @xmath8 and the other ray contains the other point .",
    "( these rays can be obtained by continuously rotating the ray through @xmath7 while forcing the ray through @xmath8 to form a @xmath43 angle with it , until an edge of @xmath36 is hit .",
    "note that the distances from @xmath7 and @xmath8 to the apex of the new wedge are no longer equal . ) therefore , to find a good pair @xmath41 , it is enough to find for every edge @xmath44 of @xmath36 the ( at most four ) points @xmath8 such that @xmath8 is a vertex of @xmath36 and a line through @xmath8 that forms @xmath43 angle with the line through @xmath44 supports @xmath36 . for every such point , we can check in constant time whether @xmath41 or @xmath45 is a good pair . finding the points @xmath8 for an edge @xmath44 as above",
    "can be done in @xmath46-time by a binary search on the vertices of @xmath36 .",
    "thus , a good pair @xmath47 and the corresponding @xmath15 , @xmath14 , and @xmath6 can be found in @xmath31-time .",
    "let @xmath48 be a line creating an angle of @xmath32 with both @xmath14 and @xmath15 such that @xmath11 is contained in the region bounded by @xmath49 and @xmath48 and there is a point @xmath50 on @xmath48 .",
    "( note that @xmath51 can be found in @xmath46-time . )",
    "let @xmath52 denote the intersection points of @xmath48 with @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively ( see figure  [ fig : wedges ] ) .",
    "let @xmath53 be such that @xmath54 is equilateral .",
    "let @xmath55 be such that @xmath56 is equilateral .",
    "* case 1 : * @xmath57 and @xmath58 . in this case",

    "let @xmath67 , let @xmath68 , and let @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is such that @xmath71 is equilateral .",
    "see figure  [ fig : case2 ] .",
    "again we have that @xmath7 is connected by edges to both @xmath8 and @xmath51 in the wedge - graph that corresponds to @xmath72 . finally , observe that in both cases the wedge - graph contains a 2-path on the vertices @xmath73 , and @xmath74 contains @xmath75 and hence the entire set of points @xmath11 .",
    "we can now easily find for each point @xmath76 in constant time a wedge of angle @xmath32 and apex @xmath77 such that in the wedge - graph that corresponds to the set of all these edges , each such @xmath77 will be connected to one of @xmath73 .",
    "depth1pt    it is left to prove our main tool , lemma  [ lemma : ice ] .",
    "this is done in the next section .",
    "we will give two different proofs for lemma [ lemma : ice ] .",
    "* proof i. * in this proof we will assume that the set @xmath4 is _ strictly _ convex , that is , we assume that the boundary of @xmath4 does not contain a straight line segment .",
    "we assume this in order to simplify the proof , however this assumption is not critical and can be avoided .",
    "we bring this proof mainly for its independent interest ( see claim  [ claim : per ] below ) .",
    "the second proof of lemma [ lemma : ice ] is shorter and applies for general @xmath4 .    for an angle @xmath78",
    "we denote by @xmath79 a ( possibly translated ) copy of @xmath4 rotated in an angle of @xmath80 .",
    "let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be two rays emanating from the origin @xmath6 and creating an angle @xmath1 .",
    "observe that for every @xmath80 there exists a unique translation of @xmath79 that is contained in @xmath16 and both @xmath14 and @xmath15 touch @xmath79 at a _ single _ point ( here we use the fact that @xmath4 is _ strictly _ convex ) .",
    "for every @xmath78 we denote by @xmath81 and @xmath82 the two touching points on @xmath14 and on @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "let @xmath83 denote the distance between @xmath82 and the origin ( see figure  [ fig : proof1 ] ) .",
    "consider the boundary @xmath87 with the positive ( counterclockwise ) orientation .",
    "note that since @xmath4 is convex , at each point @xmath88 there is a unique supporting line pointing forward ( here after positive tangent ) , and a unique supporting line pointing backwards ( the two tangent lines coincide iff @xmath87 is smooth at @xmath35 ) .",
    "let @xmath89 be a unit speed curve traveling around @xmath87 .",
    "we define a function @xmath90 in the following way : if @xmath91 belongs to the part of the boundary of @xmath79 between @xmath81 and @xmath82 that is visible from @xmath6 , then we set @xmath90 to be equal to the length of the orthogonal projection of the unit positive tangent at @xmath91 on the @xmath92-axis ( see figure  [ fig : proof1 ] ) .",
    "otherwise we set @xmath93 .",
    "the simple but important observation here is that for every @xmath78 the expression @xmath94 is equal to the @xmath92-coordinate of @xmath82 .",
    "this , in turn , is equal by definition to @xmath95 . to see this observation",
    "take a small portion of the boundary of @xmath96 of length @xmath97 that is visible from @xmath6 .",
    "its orthogonal projection on the @xmath92-axis has ( by definition ) length @xmath98 .",
    "notice that the orthogonal projection of the entire part of the boundary of @xmath96 that is visible from @xmath6 on the @xmath92-axis ( whose length , therefore , equals to this integral ) is precisely all the points on the @xmath92-axis with smaller @xmath92-coordinate than that of @xmath82 .            to see this",
    "observe that @xmath91 is visible from @xmath6 through the rotation of @xmath4 precisely from where it lies on the ray @xmath15 until it lies on the ray @xmath14 . through this period the angle which the positive tangent at @xmath91 creates with the @xmath86-axis varies from @xmath102 to @xmath103",
    ". combining ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) we conclude :          analogously to @xmath83 we define @xmath106 to be the distance from @xmath81 to the origin @xmath6 .",
    "lemma  [ lemma : ice ] is equivalent to saying that there is a @xmath80 for which @xmath107 . by a similar argument or by applying the result of claim [ claim : per ] to a reflection of @xmath4",
