    "the main goal of this series of publications is to introduce and apply a new theoretical method aimed at the description of the wide class of statistical phenomena known under the name  spin glasses",
    "the name originates from the specific class of disordered magnetics with elementary dipoles ( spins ) being frozen in random orientations .",
    "it appeared , however , that similar phenomena are widespread in nature .",
    "numerous phenomena in physics ( amorphous magnetism and ferroelectricity , structural glasses ) , biology ( patterns formation in neural networks , proteins folding ) , and computer science ( storage and interaction of patterns in memory ) may be described using a mathematical models of the same class .",
    "numerous books and reviews on the subject are available ( see @xcite and references cited therein ) .    among all the models , describing glassy behavior ,",
    "the simplest is the disordered ising model with competing interactions .",
    "originally it was introduced to describe glassy state of a solution of a magnetic metal in a nonmagnetic one , e.g. iron in gold . there",
    "the point is the exchange interaction between magnetic ions may be either ferro- or antiferromagnetic , depending upon the distance between ions , which is a fluctuating random variable . the specific feature of such a system is the possibility of _ frustrations _ in it .",
    "a primitive illustration may looks like this : let us consider three ising spins , @xmath0 .",
    "the hamiltonian is : @xmath1 if all the pair interaction energies @xmath2 ( purely ferromagnetic case ) , then the ground state is two - fold degenerate , either all spins are @xmath3 , or @xmath4 . however , if one or all three interactions are negative , then the specific case becomes possible .",
    "for example , let us set @xmath5 .",
    "spin configurations @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 have the energy , equal to @xmath9 , while the configuration @xmath10 has the energy @xmath11 .",
    "the ground state becomes six - fold degenerate .",
    "the situation is quite similar if @xmath12 .",
    "this reasoning can be easily generalized to the case , when @xmath13 ising spins are arranged in a ring , and the number of antiferromagnetic interactions is odd .",
    "the special attention should be paid to the fact , that , strictly speaking , this degeneracy exists only if all the interaction energies are equal in value , @xmath14 .",
    "for example , if in the triangle we have : @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , the ground state is ferromagnetic and only two - fold degenerate .",
    "if to assume @xmath18 to be fluctuating random variables , then , in a common case , the measure of frustrated configurations is zero .",
    "if there is a macroscopic number of frustrations in a macroscopic system of a size @xmath19 , then the degeneracy of the ground state appears to be @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "this leads to a nonzero value of the entropy in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "the example is the antiferromagnetic ising model on the triangular lattice .",
    "however , in a disordered systems frustrations , strictly speaking , exist only if the distribution of couplings is something very special , e.g. @xmath22 .",
    "usually , some configurations _ close _ to frustration may be realized , rather then true frustration , if ferro- and antiferromagnetic interactions coexist in a system .",
    "therefore , one can expect the residual entropy to be zero , but some kind of singularity of the entropy and of the specific heat at zero temperature is possible .",
    "originally the migdal - kadanoff real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) was introduced more then fifty years ago by leo kadanoff @xcite .",
    "then its continuous rescaling version was introduced by a.a .",
    "migdal @xcite .",
    "comprehensive review of further developments of the rsrg approach was recently given in @xcite .",
    "the first attempt to apply rsrg to spin glass problem was made by droz and matasinas @xcite .",
    "however , there severe and unjustified approximations were made for the problem to be solvable .",
    "then the rsrg with integer rescaling factor was used in a number of works ( see e.g. @xcite ) the rsrg analysis was applied in @xcite to analyze the multicritical points ( coexistence of ( para / ferro)magnetic and spin glass phases ) positions .",
    "a different version of rsrg for spin glasses was used in @xcite .",
    "tensor rsrg for spin glasses was used in @xcite , and rsrg for ising model with long range coupling was elaborated in @xcite    a functional version of rsrg with continuous rescaling was introduced in @xcite to study the behavior of conductivity at and near the percolation threshold .",
    "actually the rsrg is exact for one - dimensional systems with short - range interaction , so it was applied for @xmath23-dimensional fractals.it was a surprise , that renormalization equations ( nonlinear integro - differential ones ) there allow exact solution , provided by the saddle point approximation in the integrals .",
    "this paper , first in a series , is devoted to the construction of mathematical formalism of rsrg for a disordered ising model . in section [ sec : statistical ] general concepts of the statistical mechanics of disordered systems was applied to the ising model . the crucial point is to perform _ configuration average _ of the free energy . here",
    "a new representation of the distribution of interaction energies is introduced and named @xmath24-representation .",
    "formulas , connecting @xmath24-representation with fourier ( or two - sided laplace ) one are derived",
    ". averaged free energy is defined as a _ functional of the distribution of interaction energies .",
    "_ adding one extra link , not necessary between nearest neighbors , and calculating the corresponding variation of the free energy as a function of the strength the length of this link provide us with _ generating function for the momenta of the spin - spin correlator _",

    "the pair correlator gives us an information about spin ordering in a system .",
    "thermodynamic quantities , namely the entropy and the heat capacity may be written as : @xmath43 @xmath44 respectively .      in the rest of the paper",
    "the limit of infinite system size , @xmath19 , will be implied everywhere . therefore , the specific values per spin are to be introduced for extensive quantities @xmath45 : for free energy , @xmath46 for the entropy , @xmath47 and for the heat capacity , @xmath48    let us consider the ising model on an infinite @xmath49-dimensional hypercubic lattice .",

    "the main idea of a renormalization group is an elimination of some degrees of freedom of a system under consideration . in the statistical mechanics of equilibrium systems",
