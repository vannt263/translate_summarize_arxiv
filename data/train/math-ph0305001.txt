    "-5 mm    many continuum systems in materials science display pattern formation .",
    "these patterns are characterized by one or several length scales .",
    "the scaling of these characteristic lengths in the material parameters and/or in time are usually an experimentally robust feature .",
    "these scaling laws , and their characterizing exponents , are of interest to theoretical physics since they express a certain universality . at the same time , scaling laws ( rather than more detailed features ) are ameanable to heuristic and rigorous analysis and thus are a good test for the model and a challenge for mathematics .",
    "scaling laws and their exponents reflect a scale invariance . in a multiscale model ,",
    "these scale invariances are broken and only approximately valid in certain parameter and/or time regimes .",
    "the cross - over between two scaling laws reflects a change in the dominant physical mechanisms . in studying cross - overs",
    ", theoretical analysis may have an advantage over numerical simulation which has to explore many parameter decades and thus has to cope with widely separated length scales .",
    "together with various collaborators , the author has analyzed scaling laws and their cross - overs in both static ( variational ) and dynamic models .",
    "the dynamic models considered were of gradient - flow type and thus endowed with a variational interpretation : steepest descent in a multiscale energy landscape .",
    "the examples are    * the branching of domains in uniaxial ferromagnets @xcite ( with r.  choksi and r.  v.  kohn ) .",
    "strongly uniaxial ferromagnets have only two favored magnetization directions ( `` up '' and `` down '' ) .",
    "the width of the corresponding domains decreases towards a sample surface perpendicular to the favored axis .",
    "we rigorously establish the scaling of the energy in the sample dimensions in support of this behavior .",
    "to leading order , the micromagnetic model behaves like a three - dimensional analogue of the kohn - mller @xcite model for twin branching . *",
    "the period of cross - tie walls in ferromagnetic films @xcite ( with a.  desimone , r.  v.  kohn and s.  mller ) .",
    "cross - tie walls are transition layers between domains in ferromagnetic films .",
    "they display a periodic structure in the tangential direction .",
    "the experimentally observed scaling of the period in the material parameters is not well - understood @xcite . in this paper , we present a combination of heuristic and rigorous analysis which reproduces the experimental scaling and thus identifies the relevant mechanism . *",
    "the rate of capillarity - driven spreading of a thin droplet @xcite ( with l.  giacomelli ) . here , the starting point is the lubrication approximation .",
    "the scale invariant version of the model is ill - posed and has to be regularized near the contact line , e.  g.through allowing finite slippage . in this paper",
    ", we rigorously derive a scaling law for the spreading of the droplet in an intermediate time regime .",
    "this scaling law depends only logarithmically on the length scale introduced by the regularization , in agreement with a conjecture of de gennes @xcite . *",
    "the rate of coarsening in spinodal decomposition @xcite ( with r.  v.  kohn ) .",
    "spinodal decomposition is usually modelled by a cahn - hilliard equation . in the later stages",
    ", it is experimentally observed that the phase distribution coarsens in a statistically self - similar fashion . in this paper , we rigorously prove upper bounds for this coarsening process .",
    "the exponents are the ones heuristically expected and depend on whether the mobility is degenerate or non - degenerate : @xmath0 resp . @xmath1 . in @xcite , we predict a cross - over for almost degenerate mobility due to a change in the coarsening mechanism .",
    "* the first - order correction to the lifshitz - slyozov - wagner theory for ostwald ripening @xcite ( with a.  hnig and b.niethammer ) .",
    "ostwald ripening describes the late stage of spinodal decomposition in an off - critical mixture ( volume fraction of one phase @xmath2 ) .",
    "the minority phase then consists of several particles immersed in a matrix of the majority phase .",
    "the particles are approximately spherical and do nt move  the lifshitz ",
    "wagner theory describes the evolution of the radii distribution .",
    "there is a major interest in identifying the next - order correction term in @xmath3 .",
    "we rigorously show that there is a cross - over in the correction term from @xmath4 to @xmath5 depending on the system size .",
    "our method to rigorously analyze these scaling laws in a multiscale model is based on relating integral quantities ( energies , average length scales , dissipation rates ... ) .",
    "it is different from the more local method of matched asymptotic expansions . in particular",
    ", it differs from the latter by the absence of a specific ansatz . in order to relate the integral quantities in our _ ansatz - free _ approach , we need _",
    "interpolation inequalities_. these interpolation inequalities encode the competition of the dominant physical mechanisms in a scale - invariant fashion ( e.  g.  the competition between driving energetics and limiting dissipation or between bulk and surface energy ) .",
    "hence tools from pure analysis are here employed in a more applied context .    in order to illustrate this set of ideas , we present a simple application .",
    "-5 mm    according to the well - accepted micromagnetic model , the experimentally observed ground - state of the magnetization @xmath6 is the minimizer of a variational problem .",
    "we are interested in transition layers ( `` walls '' ) between domains in a film of thickness @xmath7 in the @xmath8-plane .",
    "we assume that the in - plane axis @xmath9 is favored by the crystalline anisotropy so that domains of magnetization @xmath10 or @xmath11 form . in order to avoid `` magnetic poles '' , the walls separating such domains are parallel to the @xmath12-axis .",
    "we are interested in their specific energy per unit length in @xmath12-direction .",
    "hence the admissible magnetizations @xmath6 are @xmath12-independent and connect the two end - states @xmath13 \\quad\\mbox{and}\\quad\\lim_{x_1\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty } m_2(x_1,x_3)\\;=\\;\\pm1 . \\end{array}\\ ] ] the specific energy , which is to be minimized , is given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 refers to the variables @xmath16 . here",
    "the first term is the `` exchange energy '' , the second term comes from crystalline anisotropy and favors the @xmath9-axis .",
    "the last term is the energy of the stray - field @xmath17 determined by the static maxwell equations @xmath18 which are conveniently expressed in variational form for the potential @xmath19 @xmath20 we see that both `` volume charges '' ( @xmath21 in @xmath22 ) and `` surface charges '' ( @xmath23 on @xmath24 ) generate the field @xmath25 and thus are penalized .",
    "since the energy density , i.e. @xmath26 , depends on @xmath6 through ( [ defuvar ] ) , the problem is non - local .",
    "the constraint of unit length , see ( [ defad ] ) , makes the variational problem nonconvex .",
    "the model is already partially non - dimensionalized : the magnetization @xmath6 and the field @xmath27 are dimensionless , but length is still dimensional . in particular , @xmath28 has dimensions of length ( the `` exchange length '' ) and @xmath29 is dimensionless ( the `` quality factor '' ) .",
    "hence the model has two intrinsic length scales ( material parameters ) , namely @xmath28 and @xmath30 , and one extrinsic length scale ( sample geometry ) , namely @xmath7 . despite its simplicity ,",
    "it is an example of a multiscale model and we expect different regimes depending on the two nondimensional parameters @xmath29 and @xmath31 .",
    "we will focus on the most interesting regime of `` soft '' materials ( i.  e.  with low crystalline anisotropy ) and thicknesses @xmath7 close to the exchange length @xmath28 @xmath32 numerical simulation suggest a cross - over _ within _ this range ( * ? ? ?",

    "our proposition rigorously captures this cross - over in energy .",

    "@xmath40 up to a generic universal constant and @xmath41 stands for both @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "this scaling qualitatively agrees with the numerical study of the energy cross - over in the thickness - axis corresponds to @xmath31 , the @xmath42-axis to @xmath43 , and @xmath44 given in ( * ? ? ?",

    "lower _ bound in ( [ p.7 ] ) states that one can not beat the ansatz  at least in terms of energy scaling  by relaxing the geometry assumptions ( [ an1 ] ) or ( [ an2 ] )",
