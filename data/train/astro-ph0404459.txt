    "symbiotic stars are binary stars that are identified spectroscopically as typically having three components : a giant , a hot star ( usually a white dwarf ) , and a circumstellar nebula , ionized by the hot component s radiation field .",
    "accretion of material from the giant s wind onto the white dwarf can lead to eruptions that may last several years and raise the system s brightness by several magnitudes .",
    "ag draconis ( bd+67@xmath0922 ) is one of the brightest symbiotics at uv and x - ray wavelengths and undergoes outbursts in 36 year long intervals that repeat every 15 years or so .",
    "the observations described here took place during quiescence .",
    "the components of ag dra are a k04 giant and a hot star , most likely a white dwarf @xcite .",
    "for convenience we will refer to the hot component as a white dwarf for the remainder of this article .",
    "the temperature of the white dwarf is derived through fitting a blackbody curve to the continuum observed at x - ray and uv wavelengths , although contrasting results are found : @xcite finding a temperature of 170,000  k from rosat x - ray spectra , while @xcite finding 100,000  k from iue spectra .",
    "the system is a non - eclipsing binary with an orbital period of @xmath10550  days @xcite .",
    "the radial velocity was found by @xcite to be @xmath11  km  s@xmath12  and they give the rotational velocity of the giant as @xmath13  km  s@xmath12 .",
    "the abundances of the giant are well determined @xcite and demonstrate that it is metal deficient and possibly a barium star .",
    "the distance to ag dra is crucial in fixing many of the properties of the system , yet it is rather uncertain , with the _ hipparcos _ satellite only yielding a lower limit of 1  kpc .",
    "@xcite argue from a classification of the giant for a distance of 2.5  kpc , which is the value we adopt in the present work .",
    "ag dra is a particularly attractive target in the far ultraviolet on account of the low extinction ( e@xmath14=0.05 * ? ? ?",
    "* ) along its sightline , resulting from the high latitude of the system ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "spectra from the international ultraviolet explorer ( _ iue _ ) showed strong emission lines from highly ionized species including heii @xmath11640 , civ @xmath1@xmath11548,1550 and nv @xmath11238,1242 @xcite .",
    "the first reported observations for wavelengths below 1200  were made by @xcite who identified strong emission lines from ovi @xmath11032,1038 and heii @xmath11085 .",
    "we report here observations made with the _ far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer _ ( _ fuse _ ) in the wavelength region 9051187  made in 2000 march and 2001 april during a quiescent period of the system .",
    "these spectra are at a higher resolution and sensitivity than any previous spectra in this range and reveal a number of new plasma diagnostics available for interpreting the nebular emission from the system .",
    "_ fuse _  is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , and we describe the main features of the spectrograph here .",
    "there are four telescope channels labeled lif1 , lif2 , sic1 , and sic2 , each containing a mirror , a focal plane assembly and a grating .",
    "the labels refer to the coatings on the mirrors and gratings , either silicon carbide ( sic ) or lithium fluoride ( lif ) .",
    "the lif coatings are highly efficient at wavelengths above @xmath16 , but have very little efficiency for smaller wavelengths , hence the sic channels extend the _ fuse _  wavelength range down to 900 .",
    "there are two detectors , with the lif1 and sic1 spectra being imaged on detector 1 , and lif2 and sic2 imaged on detector 2 .",
    "each detector consists of two segments , labeled a and b , which are read out independently by the detector electronics .",
    "the lif and sic spectra on each segment are treated individually by the _ fuse _  calibration pipeline , and so one refers to , e.g. , the lif1a spectrum , the sic2b spectrum , etc . as there is a physical gap between each detector s two segments",
    ", there is a gap of @xmath17  between the a and b spectra for each channel .",
    "there are three apertures on the focal plane assembly that are available for observing , the largest ( @xmath18 ) and smallest ( @xmath19 ) apertures were used for the ag dra observations .",
    "guiding is done via a fine error sensor , which is fixed to the lif1 channel .",
    "the target can move in the remaining channel apertures due to thermally - induced mirror motions .",
    "the motion of the sic channels is generally greater than that for lif2 and occasionally the target can leave the aperture .",
    "version 1.8.7 of the _ fuse _  calibration pipeline was run on the raw data files .",
    "in particular , versions 6 and 10 of the flux and calibration files were used , respectively . for the sic spectra , only that portion of the observation for which the target was in the aperture ( see sect .  [ sect.obs ] ) was run through the pipeline to minimize background counts in the spectra .",
    "the components of ag dra are not resolved by _ fuse _  and so the spectra presented here show emission from the entire system .",
    "two observations were performed through programs s312 and p248 , and details are given in table  [ agdra - obs ] .",
    "the sic channels were only aligned for small portions of the total exposure time in 2000  march , leading to effective exposure times of 440  s and 300  s for sic1 and sic2 , respectively .",
    "the ovi @xmath11032 flux from the 2000  march observation was @xmath20  erg @xmath21 s@xmath12 @xmath12  in the center of the line , exceeding the _ fuse _  flux limit of @xmath22  erg @xmath21 s@xmath12 @xmath12 , and so a special observing sequence was employed for the second observation to ensure the safety of the _ fuse _  detectors .",
    "ag dra was first observed through the 1.5@xmath23 @xmath24 20@xmath23 slit ( hirs ) which has a throughput around 50% of that of the standard 30@xmath23 @xmath24 30@xmath23 slit and so the count rate on the detector at @xmath11032 was reduced .",
    "coupled with the expected fall in the @xmath11032 flux due to observing at a different orbital phase of the system ( sect .",
    "[ sect.time-var ] ) , the effective @xmath11032 flux then fell below the _ fuse _  flux limit .",
    "alignment of the target in the aperture is much more difficult with the hirs slit and so observation p2480101 consisted of three individual exposures .",
    "the @xmath11032 line was used to check target alignment during the exposures as it is observed in all four of the _ fuse _  telescope channels and has a high count rate .",
    "the lif1 channel was aligned throughout , with only a small loss of flux in the third exposure .",
    "lif2 showed a loss of flux of around 10% compared to lif1 .",
    "a significant number of counts were only detected from sic1 in the third exposure , but there are rapid variations in the count rate during this exposure and so these data are not useful .",
    "sic2 showed a relatively uniform @xmath11032 count rate during exposures 2 and 3 , but very few counts in exposure 1 .",

    "the effective areas of the sic channels are lower than those of the lifs , while the degree of astigmatism is greater and so the count rate per unit area on the detector is much lower .",
    "this results in the count rate in the @xmath11032 line lying at a safe level .",
    "no loss of flux is evident during the single sic - only exposure .",

    ".    the present work will largely focus on the emission lines in the spectrum .",
    "we briefly discuss some properties of the interstellar lines here .",
    "comparisons of the absorption line wavelengths with those of the emission lines shows that they are redshifted relative to the radial velocity of the system by @xmath25  km  s@xmath12  and so are from the interstellar medium .",

    "the h@xmath26 lines serve as useful fiducial marks for fixing the wavelength scale of the _ fuse _  spectra as many of the lines are not saturated ( unlike the atomic species ) .",
    "we adopt a velocity of @xmath30  km  s@xmath12  for the interstellar lines based on _ iue _  spectra @xcite .    in the following sections some references are made to the interstellar h@xmath26 lines , and we make use of the shorthand notation for referring to the h@xmath26 transitions introduced by @xcite .",
    "thus , e.g. , l13r3 refers to the @xmath31 to @xmath32 , r(3 ) transition of the h@xmath26 lyman band ; while w0r3 refers to the @xmath33 to @xmath32 , r(3 ) transition of the werner band .",

    "a difficulty for this particular model lies in the p cygni profile of the ovi line , since the continuum in the far ultraviolet is due to the white dwarf and not the giant : for white dwarf continuum photons to be absorbed by ovi at orbital phase 0.5 ( white dwarf in front of the giant ) , the ovi ions are required to lie in front of the white dwarf along the observer s line of sight .",
    "we note however , that the electron scattered wings around the ovi lines significantly enhance the continuum ( fig .",
