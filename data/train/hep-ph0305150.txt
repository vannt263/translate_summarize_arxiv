    "high density qcd @xcite which is dealing with the parton systems where the gluon occupation numbers are large , has entered a new phase of it s development : a direct comparison with the experimental data . a considerable success @xcite has been reached in description of new precise data on deep inelastic scattering @xcite as well as in understanding of general features of hadron production in ion - ion collision @xcite .",
    "the intensive theoretical @xcite work lead to effective theory in the high parton density region with non - linear evolution equation for dipole - dipole amplitude that governs the dynamics in this region @xcite .",
    "the practical application of the high density qcd approach to a comparison with the experimental data is based on analytic @xcite and numerical @xcite solution to the non - linear equation . in spite of understanding of the main qualitative and , partly , quantative properties of the non - linear dynamics",
    ", this equation has not been solved at arbitrary values of the impact parameters ( @xmath0 ) and a number of  ad hoc \" ansatzs were used for @xmath0-dependence .",
    "it turns out that @xmath0-dependence is a challenging problem since the non - perturbative corrections are important in the large @xmath0 kinematic region .",
    "there are two different ideas on the market how to include the non - perturbative large @xmath0 behavior into high density qcd dynamics .",
    "the first one @xcite claims that the non - perturbative corrections could be taken into account only in initial condition for the non - linear evolution equation , while the other idea demands the change of the kernel in the equation @xcite .",
    "the objective of this paper is to find the semi - classical solution to the non - linear evolution equation with a special attention to the large @xmath0 behavior of the solution .",
    "the semi - classical approach has several advantages@xcite .",
    "firstly , it gives simple , transparent and analytic solution to the non - linear equation .",
    "secondly , this solution has a good theoretical accuracy in the most interesting kinematic region : at low @xmath1 and small sizes of interacting dipoles .",
    "thirdly , this approach leads to a natural definition of the new saturation scale which is the principle dimensional parameter that governs dynamics at high density qcd region @xcite .",
    "it appears in the semi - classical approach as a critical line which divides the whole set of trajectories in two parts : inside and outside of the saturation region . in other words ,",
    "this critical line is a separation line between two phase : color gluon condensate ( cgc ) and the gluon liquid and the saturation scale is the order parameter for this phase transition .",
    "the shortcoming of the semi - classical approach is the fact that the experimental data are not in the kinematic region where this approach has a good theoretical accuracy .",
    "however , we believe , that we can develop the reasonable method for the numerical solution of the non - linear equation only after studying the property of the semi - classical approach .    in the next two sections we discuss the semi - classical approach for the dipole sizes smaller than the saturation scale ( @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the saturation momentum ) .",
    "we review the semi - classical solution which has been investigated in this region ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) concentrating mostly on large @xmath0-behavior of this solution .",
    "section 4 is devoted to the semi - classical approach inside of the saturation region ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we suggest a semi - classical solution which describes the behavior of the dipole - dipole amplitude deeply inside of this domain and discuss the matching of this solution with the semi - classical solution at small dipole sizes .",
    "it turns out that this matching occurs on the special trajectory of the non - linear equation which defines the saturation scale for dipole - dipole rescattering .    in section 5",
    "we discuss the unitarity bound as well as energy behavior of the gluon structure function and the @xmath5 total cross section .",
    "section 6 gives the estimates of the accuracy of our approach .",
    "we calculate the first enhanced diagram as well as corrections to the non - linear equation that we neglected in our solution .    in the last section",
    "we summarize our results and discuss the possible practical applications .",
    "the non - linear equation that governs the dynamics in the high parton density qcd domain can be written in the following form given by balitsky and kovchegov @xcite : [ eq ] = - ( ) n(,y;b_t)+ @xmath6    the meaning of is very simple and can be seen in and .",
    "it describes the process of dipole interaction as two stages process .",
    "the first stage is decay of the initial dipole with size @xmath7 into two dipole with sizes @xmath8 and @xmath9 with probability @xmath10 in the second stage two produced dipoles interact with the target .",
    "the non - linear part of takes into account the glauber corrections for such an interaction ( see ) . the first term in stands for possibility for the initial dipole to interact with the target without decaying into two dipoles .",
    "the equation is written in the coordinate representation which has a certain advantage since @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the dipole amplitude . directly from the unitarity constraint follows that @xmath13 giving the natural asymptotic behavior for @xmath14 , namely @xmath14 tends to unity at high energies . on the other hand the non - linear term in contains the integration over sizes of produced dipoles .",
    "it means that we can not conclude that the non - linear term is small even when the sizes of the initial dipoles are very small .",
    "it turns out to be useful to consider in a mixed representation , fixing @xmath0 but introducing transverse momenta as conjugated variables to dipole sizes .",
    "the relation between these two representations are given by the following equations ( see also ): in makes @xmath15 dimensionless . ]",
    "@xmath16    in momentum representation the nonlinear term in , being the convolution in the coordinate representation , transforms to the product of two amplitudes , @xmath17 , at the same value of the initial transverse momentum ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "therefore , the large value of the initial transverse momentum guarantees the smallness of the non - linear corrections .",
    "one can actually see that the non - linear term in is a convolution only at large value of the impact parameter @xmath0 . indeed , let us rewrite the non - linear term in in the momentum representation going also to momentum transfer instead of @xmath0 .    in this case [ eq3 ] ( k , y;q)=e^ - i _",

    "we can reduce this equation to the product of @xmath28 .",
    "however , one can see that there is a region of integration over @xmath22 , namely , @xmath29 or / and @xmath30 , while @xmath31 or / and @xmath30 . in the coordinate representation ( see ) this region of integration corresponds to @xmath32 . in this region",
    "the non - linear term can be reduced to [ nlterm1 ] _",
    "d^2 n^2(2b_t , y;b_t ) with @xmath33 . in the region of large @xmath34",
    "( see for all notations ) the dipole amplitude in describes the interaction of the dipole with the size which is much larger than the size of the lower dipole in .",
    "such interaction can not be described by .",
    "indeed , the non - linear equation is proven only in the case when @xmath35 since only in such conditions we can restrict ourselves by consideration of the  fan \" diagrams ( see -a ) and only in the case of the running qcd coupling @xcite .",
    "is also valid for deep inelastic processes with nuclei @xcite but we will not consider this process here since in this case the dipole amplitude does not depend on @xmath0 for @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the nucleus radius .",
    "therefore , we should consider this region of integration as a correction to the non - linear equation together with the enhanced diagrams of -b .",
    "our strategy will be the following : we will solve the non - linear equation assuming that @xmath23 and @xmath22 @xmath38 and @xmath30 and , using this solution , we will come back to and we will discuss the contribution of the region where @xmath39 or / and @xmath30 . , while @xmath40 or @xmath30 .    finally , can be written in the form ( see ref .",

    "the general solution to the bfkl equation in the coordinate representation was derived in ref.@xcite , namely ( see ) , [ bfkl1 ] n ( r_1,r_2;y , b_t)= @xmath47    with [ omega ] ( ) = |_s ( ) and [ v ] v(r_i , r_i;)= ( ) ^1 - .",

    "it is worthwhile mentioning that @xmath332 ( see ) is not related to the running qcd coupling .",
    "it stems from the full bfkl kernel while @xmath333 arises only if we approximate the full bfkl kernel by the double log formula @xmath334 .    in the case of running @xmath137",
    "the difference is even more remarkable since our formulae lead to a different energy behavior .",
    "indeed , we have [ co3 ] ( dipole ) ( ( 1/x ) ) as one can see from .",
    "notice that extra factor 4 in the dominator stems from the different initial conditions that we used in the case of running @xmath137 .    actually , the discussion about corrections to the non - linear master equation given in section 6 can be summarize in the picture shown in . the corrections from the dipole which sizes larger than the size of the target lead to a large @xmath335 tail but it starts at very low value and it could not contribute to the energy behaviour of the total cross section .",
    "the entire picture is the same in the main features as it was suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite    we started this paper having in mind two questions to answer .",
    "the practical one : to find the analytical solution which everyone can check and which includes the impact parameter dependence .",
    "we firmly believe that only after finding such a solution we could develop the numerical methods of solving our master non - linear equation ( see ) . since the semi - classical approach is valid for the large values of @xmath336 we can use this solution as a guiding one for the numerical attempts to solve the non - linear equation .",
    "our second motivation was to reach a theoretical understand how to incorporate the non - perturbative qcd corrections in the nonlinear equation .",
    "these corrections have to be essential at large values of the impact parameters where they will change the power - like decrease in pqcd to the exponential one as follows from the spectrum of the observed hadron @xcite .",
    "we believe that we answered this question by demonstrating that we should take the non - perturbative correction only in initial conditions ( in born amplitude ) . how to take into account these non - perturbative corrections in the born amplitude was considered in our previous publications @xcite .",
    "how to incorporate the non - perturbative corrections in initial conditions or in the kernel actually crucially depends on the strategy of the approach . if you consider first the solution of the linear equation you have to include the non - perturbative corrections at large @xmath0 in the bfkl kernel as was discussed in ref .",
    "we believe that the correct strategy is to solve the non - linear equation .",
    "as has been discussed for long time @xcite the non - linear dynamics leads to a suppression at low @xmath1 of the density of partons with low transverse momenta ( @xmath337 ) . since due to the uncertainty principle @xmath338 only partons in the beginning of evolution",
    "( at @xmath339 ) could have large values of @xmath0 .",
    "in other words only parton distribution in initial parton cascade is relevant for the large @xmath0 behavior .",
    "the above statement sounds strange because we claim that in the bfkl ladder we need to take into account the non - perturbative qcd correction only for two @xmath75-channel gluons attached to the larger dipole .",
    "indeed , the large @xmath0 behavior stems from the exchange the lightest particles @xcite ( gluon in our case ) somewhere in the middle of the ` ladder ' ( see ) . since in the middle of the ladder we have massless gluons the large @xmath0 behavior",
    "is determined by the diagram of .",
    "it has a form [ lbb ] ( k , k,y;b_t)= @xmath340 where we consider the @xmath0 is much larger than typical impact parameters in the integration over @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "using we can take integrals over impact parameters in .",
    "for the upper amplitude we have to consider @xmath307 in since we do not introduce non - perturbative corrections , while for the lower amplitude we substitute our solution at large @xmath0 for which @xmath343 . finally , we have [ lbb1 ] ( k , k,y;b_t)^y_0 d y_1 f(y - y_1)^y_1_0 d y_2 y^2_2 . since @xmath344 behaves as an exponent the integral chooses small @xmath288 .",
    "therefore , actually the cell with large @xmath0 is the closest one to the largest dipole .",
    "this simple estimates show that our statement that the large @xmath0 behavior of the solution to the non - linear equation is determined by the initial condition is self - consistent .",
    "the great advantage of the semi - classical approach is that we clearly see all phases of high parton density qcd ( see ) .",
    "the critical line separates the phase with high parton densities . to the left of critical line we have a phase in which we have both saturation and the geometrical scaling behavior for the gluon density .",
    "this phase l.mclerran and his team suggested to call  color glass condensate \" ( cgc ) since the condensed system of color dipoles behaves as glass : a disordered system which evolves very slowly relative to a natural time scale ( see more and better in a new review of this approach written by iancu and venogapalan in ref . @xcite).to the right of the critical line the parton system is still rather dense but it is far away from saturation while still has a geometrical scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "this system be can call color dipole liquid ( cdl ) .",
    "the order parameter for @xmath345 transition is the saturation scale given by the critical line .",
    "the trajectory which is tangent to the critical line , separates the cdl phase from the phase with low density of color dipoles for which we can use the linear evolution equations : the bfkl or dglap ones .",
    "the natural name for this phase is color dipole gas .",
    "we thank m. braun , e. gotsman , u. maor and a. mueller for fruitful discussions on the subject of this paper .",
    "is indebted to the alexander - von - humboldt foundation for the award that gave him a possibility to work on low @xmath1 physics during the last year .",
