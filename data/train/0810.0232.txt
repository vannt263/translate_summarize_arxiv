    "the data taking at hera , where electrons or positrons of @xmath1 collided with protons of up to @xmath2 , ended in june 2007 .",
    "each of the h1 and zeus experiments collected around @xmath3 data from the whole running period 1992 - 2007 .",
    "the largest samples are from the second data taking period 2003 - 2007 ( hera-2 ) . in comparison with hera-1 ,",
    "the integrated luminosity of the @xmath4 and @xmath5 samples has a 2- and 10-fold increase , respectively .",
    "in addition , the @xmath6 and @xmath7 beams at hera-2 were longitudinally polarised .",
    "these data samples have made possible both the study of rare exclusive electroweak processes with cross section values down to @xmath8 and the search for new physics phenomena .",
    "this talk covers eight abstracts submitted to this conference from h1 and zeus on three main topics listed in the abstract .",
    "the results presented at the conference are briefly summarised here in the following sections .",
    "an excess of multi - lepton events at high @xmath9 at hera was first reported in  @xcite by h1 based on hera-1 data . the dominant standard model ( sm )",
    "processes are from the lepton pair production in photon - photon interactions , @xmath10 , where the photons are radiated from incident beam particles .",
    "the background contributions are mainly from neutral current deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and qed compton processes where in addition to genuine electrons , hadrons or radiated photons are misidentified as electrons or muons . beyond the sm , the production of a doubly charged higgs boson  @xcite or processes involving generic bosons carrying two units of lepton number ( bi - leptons )  @xcite could lead to multi - leptons events of large invariant mass .",
    "the analyses are performed in a model independent way with the following main selection cuts .",
    "take h1  @xcite as an example , each event has to have at least two central ( @xmath11 ) electron or muon candidates with the leading lepton @xmath12 , the other lepton @xmath13 and additional electrons in an extended angular region @xmath14 and additional muons in @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "h1 has analysed seven topologies in @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in all the topologies ,",
    "the observed event yields are found in good agreement with the predicted ones  @xcite .",
    "however , when the comparison is made for the invariant mass of two highest @xmath9 leptons @xmath24 , excesses are observed in most of the topologies ( table  [ table1 ] ) although the number of observed events remains statistically limited .",
    "also shown in table  [ table1 ] are preliminary results from zeus on di - electron and tri - electron samples  @xcite . in both samples no excess has been observed .",
    "h1 has also compared the distributions of the scalar sum of the transverse momentum ( @xmath25 ) ( see e.g. fig .  [",
    "h1](left ) for the @xmath4 data ) . at @xmath26 ,",
    "5 events have been observed in the @xmath4 sample with 0@xmath27 expected .",
    "none has been observed in the @xmath5 sample , however , while @xmath28 events are expected .",
    "therefore the excess is only shown in the @xmath4 data sample .",
    "differential cross sections as a function of the leading transverse momentum @xmath29 for electron and muon pair production are measured by h1  @xcite in a restricted phase space dominated by photon - photon interactions ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath11 , the inelasticity variable @xmath30 and the four - momentum transfer squared @xmath31 ) .",
    "zeus has released their preliminary results  @xcite for this conference in di - muon channel with a slightly different phase space cut ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "both h1 and zeus measure steeply falling cross sections in good agreement with the sm expectations .",
    ".the number of observed events and sm expectations in different multi - lepton topologies for @xmath24 .",
    "the numbers shown in parentheses correspond to the contribution from the dominant pair production in @xmath33 interactions . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "previously observed excesses in multi - lepton events at high transverse momenta and isolated lepton events with large missing transverse energy by h1 remain true with the full hera data sample .",
    "the largest excess is up to about @xmath34 standard deviations and is however not confirmed by zeus .",
    "attempts in combining the h1 and zeus data have started and are being pursued  @xcite .",
    "as the hera data taking has ended , it is unlikely that a definitive conclusion can be drawn with the combined data .",
    "future experiments will eventually tell us whether the excess is a purely statistical fluctuation or a first sign of new physics .    9 h1 collab .",
