    "the field of solar system dynamics , has a timeline of discoveries that is related to the computational power available ( e.g. , @xcite ) . as computational power",
    "has increased over time , so to has our ability to more accurately simulate more complex systems .",
    "the interaction between planets and planetesimals subsequent to formation is a well posed n - body problem but displays remarkable complexity even in the absence of collisions , including resonance capture , planetary migration , and heating and scattering of planetesimals . in this paper",
    "we attempt to more accurately simulate this system by using the increased computational power and on board memory recently available on video graphics cards .",
    "planet - planetesimal scattering can lead to planet migration ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recent work on dusty circumstellar disks with clearings , suggest that planets are required to account for the morphology of the disk @xcite .",
    "the planetesimal masses suggested by collisional models ( e.g. , @xcite ) and proximity of the hypothetical planet to the disks for systems such as fomalhaut intimate that planetary migration could be taking place . to simulate planet migration due to planetesimal scattering",
    ", planets must gravitationally interact with planetesimals .",
    "however , because of the @xmath0 required computational intensity previous simulations have necessarily neglected the gravitational interactions between the planetesimals ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this means that collective gravitational effects and gravitational self stirring in the disk have been ignored .",
    "here we take all interparticle forces into account to explore what differences might be seen in simulations of migrating planets with and without planetesimal interactions .",
    "the migration simulations were carried out using an n - body code running on a 4 node cluster running the `` mars hill '' rocks 4.3 linux operating system ( a centos based distribution ) that hosts 4 nvidia geforce 8800 gtx graphics cards .",
    "the code was run on the graphics processing units ( gpus ) residing on the graphics cards and is written with nvidia s cuda ( compute unified device architecture ) , a c - language development environment for cuda enabled gpus .",
    "cuda is a gpgpu ( general - purpose computing on graphics processing units ) technology that allows a programmer to use the c programming language to code algorithms for execution on the graphics processing unit .",
    "its intention is to expose the hardware to the developer through a memory management model that encourages both constant streaming of data as well as massive parallelization .",
    "we have modified the second order symplectic integrator introduced by @xcite , also known as the democratic heliocentric method , so that it runs on a gpu .",
    "we have chosen the democratic heliocentric method because the force from the central body is separated from the integration of the remainder of the particles and the coordinates do not depend on the order of the particles .",
    "this increases the accuracy of the integrator when there are large mass differences and is particularly desirable when forced to work in floating point single precision .",
    "when we obtain video cards that can compute in double precision the code will improve in precision . the move to double precision",
    "will also allow us to extend the range of the planetesimal masses simulated .    in heliocentric coordinates and barycentric momenta @xcite the hamiltonian of the system",
    "can be written @xmath1 where @xmath2 is a linear drift term and @xmath3 are the barycentric momenta . here",
    "@xmath4 is the central particle mass .",
    "the second term @xmath5 is the sum of keplerian hamiltonians for all particles with respect to the central body , @xmath6 where @xmath7 are the heliocentric coordinates and are conjugate to the barycentric momenta . here",
    "@xmath8 is the mass of the @xmath9-th particle and @xmath10 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the interaction term contains all gravitational interaction terms except those to the central body , @xmath11    the second order single timestep integrator advances with timestep @xmath12 using evolution operators ( e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath13 where we have reversed the order of the keplerian evolution and the interaction steps compared to that discussed by @xcite .",
    "we have done this to reduce the total number of computations per timestep .",
    "the keplerian advance requires @xmath14 computations but interaction term requires @xmath0 computations .",
    "the drift evolution operator requires computation of the sum of the momenta .",
    "we have implemented this using a parallel reduction sum algorithm available with the nvidia cuda software development kit ( sdk ) 1.1 that is similar to the scan prefix sum algorithm @xcite .",
    "the keplerian step was implemented with @xmath15 and @xmath16 functions using the universal differential kepler s equation @xcite so that bound and unbound particles can both be integrated with the same routine .",
    "the keplerian evolution step is also done on the gpu with each thread computing the evolution for a separate particle .",
    "the dominant source of error is in the keplerian evolution step and is due to the single floating point precision .",
    "these errors can cause a systematic radial drift that does not average to zero . to minimize errors caused by the single precision computation during the kepler advances we chose @xmath15 and @xmath16 functions that maintain angular momentum conservation across each evolution step .",
    "the positions and velocities at a later time can be written in terms of those at an earlier time @xmath17 the angular momentum at the later time , @xmath18 can be written in terms of that at the earlier time , @xmath19 , @xmath20 conservation of angular momentum yields the condition @xmath21 we utilize this formula to solve for one of the 4 functions reducing the inward radial drift resulting by the single precision computation during the keplerian advances .",
    "the interaction terms are computed on the gpu with all @xmath22 force pairs evaluated explicitly in parallel .",
    "the algorithm is based on the algorithm described by @xcite .",
    "this algorithm takes advantage of fast shared memory on board the gpu to simultaneously compute all forces in a @xmath23 tile of particle positions , where @xmath24 is the number of threads chosen for the computation ( typically 256 ) .",
    "the total energy was evaluated with a kernel explicitly evaluating all @xmath22 pair potential energy terms , similar to that calculating all @xmath22 forces .",
    "after the change to heliocentric / barycentric coordinates , the position of the first coordinate corresponds to the center of mass and center of momentum .",
    "the trajectory of this particle need not be integrated .",
    "however it is convenient to calculate the energy using all pair interactions including the central mass .",
    "the interaction term in the keplerian part of the hamiltonian can be computed at the same times as @xmath25 if @xmath26 is set to zero .",
    "consequently we set @xmath27 at the beginning of the computation .",
    "this is equivalent to working in the center of mass and momentum reference frame . because we would like to be able to quickly check the total energy , we have chosen to keep the first particle corresponding to the center of mass and momentum as the first element in the position and velocity arrays . during computation of",
    "@xmath25 we set @xmath4 to zero so that force terms from the first particle are not computed .",
    "these are already taken into account in the evolution term corresponding to @xmath5 .",
    "the mass is restored during the energy sum computation as all potential energy terms must be calculated explicitly .",
    "the location of memory should be considered when running routines as data transfer between the cpu and gpu can slow the code .",
    "the maximum theoretical throughput of pci - express 16x bus technology , the interlink between the cpu and gpu on intel processor based motherboards , is 4 gb / s with a significantly higher latency than on device memory transfers . depending on gpu design",
    ", theoretical memory transfer throughputs can approach 100 gb / s , as is the case for the 8800 gtx which has a theoretical throughput of 86.4 gb / s . reducing the number of data transfers between the cpu and gpu not only reduces the cpu clock time required for a calculation , but also reduces the number of calls which have higher latency .",
    "cpu and gpu global memory access is a significant bottleneck compared to the actual number of clock cycles required for a specific calculation with the former containing a much higher performance penalty due to latency .",
    "for this reason , positions and velocities for all particles are kept in global memory on board the gpu device .",
    "arrays for both current and previous time step positions are required during the interaction step computation .",
    "the particle positions and velocities are only transferred back into host or cpu accessible memory to output data files .",
    "an additional float vector of length equal to the number of particles is allocated in global memory on the device to compute the momentum sums used in the drift step computation . shared memory on the gpu is used during the all pairs interaction computation step and during the reduction sum . shared memory on",
    "the gpu drastically increases the speed of calculations because the use of shared memory has almost no latency penalty compared to that of both the cpu and the gpu global memory . by streaming information from global memory to shared memory , we are able to hide the latency of global memory , further increasing the computation speed .",
    "though the maximum number of threads on the video card we used is 512 , we found that register space on the gpu limited the interaction step computation to 256 threads per block due to its complexity .",
    "a more detailed review of nvidia gpu hardware and programming techniques can be found in the cuda programming guide .",
    "we work in a lengthscale in units of the outermost planet s initial semi - major axis and with a timescale such that @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mass of the central star .",
    "the following self - consistency checks on the code were performed .",
    "we checked that two body dynamics is preserved for all particles when all masses but the central one are zero . in this case the orbital elements ( excepting the mean anomaly ) are conserved at the level of the precision of computation .",
    "we checked that the energy computation computed in heliocentric / barycentric coordinates is consistent with that computed in cartesian coordinates .",
    "we checked that the conversion to heliocentric / barycentric coordinates followed by inverse conversion returns the initial coordinates .",
    "we checked that the force and potential energy terms computed on the gpu are consistent with those computed on cpu .",
    "we checked that the n - body simulation without keplerian integration conserves energy .",
    "we note that the order of some of the arguments in the sdk1.1 nbody kernel were inconsistent with the correct order described by @xcite . to conserve energy we corrected the order of the arguments in the force computation step from that in the sdk1.1 nbody kernel .",
    "we checked that integrating a two body system conserves energy .",
    "we ran a test case identical to that run by @xcite and shown in their figure 5 with similar results ( though see discussion on energy conservation in the next section ) .",
    "this corresponds to 2 earth mass planets embedded in a uniform disk of 800 objects 1/100 of the mass of the planets .",
    "this test case was also integrated by @xcite .",
    "the second set of checks was done by running full simulations in order to determine the smoothing length and time step requirements and restrictions . in one test",
    "we varied the time step significantly in order to measure the impact of larger time steps on our accuracy .",
    "a larger timestep would allow us to run the simulation for more orbital periods .",
    "we ran full @xmath30 particle simulations over thousands of orbits and noted that varying the time step resulted in little difference in the total energy measured . in our second test",
    ", we varied the softening length in 2 different sets of simulations .",
    "at extremely small softening length values we note that the simulated system becomes extremely stochastic .",
    "the reverse effect is exhibited when we make the smoothing length extremely large .",
    "this effect was previously noted in @xcite and happens because our simulation does not adjust the time step to take into account collisions and close encounters .",
    "since the simulation steps are small enough to allow `` smooth '' or nearly continuous updates , there is the possibility that a close encounter between two objects will be forced by the step which may have never occurred physically .",
    "if the softening length is made too large , the forces between objects that are having close encounters is reduced unrealistically .",
    "the softening length is chosen to help prevent this from happening .",
    "@xcite selects a softening parameter set as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the hill radius of a planetesimal .",
    "this leads to a hill radius which is roughly equivalent to the physical radius of a protoplanet at 1au .",
    "given these parameters , we chose a variety of smoothing lengths that were on the same order of magnitude and did not note a significant any significant deviations between the results of the simulations .",
    "the smoothing length and timestep were not adjusted during the simulation .",
    "we measured the time to run our code on on the nvidia geforce 8800 gtx graphics cards .",
    "the timing included the delay to send the job out to the individual nodes of the cluster , initial disk generation and input and output of files .",
    "we ran a simulation of a disk with 2 planets , one at semi - major axis @xmath33 with the other interior to this .",
    "the planet masses were @xmath34 of that of the star .",
    "the planets were surrounded by a disk of particles with mass @xmath35 of that of the central star .",
    "time units were set such that @xmath36 .",
    "the time step was 0.1 or @xmath37 of the outer planet s orbit . for @xmath30 particles 1000 timesteps ran with 0.137 s per timestep . for @xmath38 particles 100 timesteps ran with 57s per timestep and similar error .",
    "the energy fraction error was @xmath34 throughout the entire simulation and drifts downward systematically with time such that the system becomes increasingly bound .",
    "the systematic loss of energy and associated radial inward drift we have determined is caused by the single point floating precision for calculations done during the kepler advances .      in this paper we primarily discuss simulations with 2 planets and an exterior annulus of planetesimals .",
    "the initial planetesimal disk has a flat distribution in semi - major axis so that the surface density is proportional to @xmath39 for radius @xmath40",
    ". an isotropic disk is generated with initial eccentricity and inclination dispersion such that @xmath41 and initial inclination dispersion set to 0.01 .",
    "the smoothing length was typically set to be slightly smaller than the mean interparticle spacing .",
    "typical mean spacing values for @xmath30 particles in units of the inner planet s semi - major axis was around 0.01 , with our smoothing length set correspondingly to 0.01 .",
    "the smoothing length spacing was set the same for all simulations .",
    "the timestep was set at 0.1 where the orbital period of the inner planet is @xmath42 .",
    "a timestep of 0.1 is convenient because it ensures accuracy while still allowing of order @xmath43 orbital periods to be completed within 24 hours for @xmath30 particles .",
    "comparisons between simulations with timesteps of 0.2 , 0.1 and 0.05 yielded only insignificant differences in planetary migration rates , indicating that our simulations are not strongly sensitive to the chosen time step .",
    "all other parameters are listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "the initial semi - major axes of the planetesimals ranges from 1.5 to 3.0 .",
    "we work in units of the outermost planet s initial semi - major axis and with @xmath28 so that the initial period of the outermost planet is @xmath44 .",
    "we discuss most timescales in units of the outermost planet s initial rotation period . the initial inclination and eccentricity of the two planets",
    "were set to zero .",
    "however , we have found that planet eccentricities and inclinations rapidly settled toward zero for the planetesimal disks considered here .",
    "all simulations were run for approximately 4000 orbits .",
    "our code can compute all interparticle forces , however most planet migration simulations have neglected forces between planetesimals .",
    "we desire a direct comparison between simulations that take into account all inter particles forces and those that neglect forces between planetesimals . to do this we run two versions of our code that are identical except that interparticle forces are not computed if both particle masses are below that of a planet . in all other",
    "respects the two sets of simulations are identical .",
    "we begin our study of migration with the simplest system that allows migration of the outer planet into the disk ; that of two planets just inside an initially cold ( low velocity dispersion ) annulus of planetesimals .",
    "our first set of simulation has a inner planet with mass @xmath34 of that of the central star ( similar to jupiter ) and an outer planet with a mass ratio of @xmath45 ( similar to uranus ) .",
    "a low mass was initially chosen for the outer planet so that outer disk is not completely disrupted during migration .",
    "a mass similar to that of uranus was chosen simply because in our test runs it showed the most interesting variation in its migration rate .",
    "larger planet masses showed increasing disk disruption while lower masses showed greater degrees of stochastic motion .",
    "a high mass inner planet was initially chosen to ensure that particles can be efficiently scattered by the outer planet and subsequently ejected by the inner planet .",
    "while this mechanism can function for an inner planet that has mass ratio less than @xmath34 , the migration of the outer planet is then more sensitive to the distance between the planets .",
    "our choice of a large inner planet reduces the dependence on the distance between the planets .",
    "if the distance between the two planets is large then it takes longer for the outer planet to scatter particles sufficiently that they cross the inner planet s orbit .",
    "the parameters of our simulations are listed in table [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "three sets of simulations are run .",
    "the first ten , denoted c1-c10 , include all pair - wise forces and contain a range of planetesimal disk masses and number of planetesimals . in these simulations",
    "the planetesimal mass is fixed at @xmath35 of the stellar mass .",
    "the most massive disks simulated ( simulations c1 , n1 , and v1-v10 ) have a mass ratio of @xmath34 .",
    "this is a factor of a few larger than the more massive 200 earth mass disks simulated by previous studies @xcite .",
    "simulations n1-n10 are identical to c1-c10 except forces between planetesimals are neglected .",
    "simulations v1-v10 compute all force pairs , have the same total planetesimal disk mass , but vary the number of planetesimals and the planetesimal mass .",
    "we first discuss the semi - major axis and eccentricity distributions during the simulations .",
    "we compare simulations with and without planetesimal self - gravity .",
    "we then discuss differences seen in the migration rates of the outer planet .",
    "last , we consider the effects of increasing the number of particles in a simulation while maintaining a constant mass disk .",
    "figure [ fig:10000 ] shows the semi - major axis vs eccentricity distribution at different times during the c1 simulation computing all force pairs for 10000 planetesimals .",
    "each frame in the figure is separated by 200 orbital times where an orbital time corresponds to the initial orbital period of the outer planet . as can be seen from the position of the outer planet in each frame it migrates outward during the simulation .",
    "the inner planet drifts inwards but not significantly so because it is more massive than the outer planet .",
    "the particles with semi - major axis interior to the outer planet are higher after the planet has passed than they were before hand , leaving a possible signature of a migrating planet ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we also notice an increase in the eccentricity dispersion of particles in the outer disk with time during the first half of the simulation .",
    "we can compare this simulation to an identical one , denoted n1 but lacking planetesimal self - gravity .",
    "the semi - major axis and eccentricity distributions for this simulation are shown in figure [ fig:10000-noselfgrav ] .",
    "the increase in eccentricity dispersion of particles in the outer disk seen in the self - gravitating disk is not present in simulation n1 .",
    "thus the eccentricity dispersion increase in the self - gravitating outer disk is likely caused by gravitational stirring of the planetesimals by themselves .",
    "two dominant scattering surfaces are seen as broad strokes in the semi - major axis vs eccentricity distributions of figure [ fig:10000 ] and [ fig:10000-noselfgrav ] , one each from the inner and outer planet .",
    "these surfaces correspond to particles with semi - major axis and eccentricity that have periastron crossing a planet s orbit .",
    "similar scattering surfaces have previously been seen in simulations of migrating planets ( e.g. , @xcite ) and imply that both planets are scattering planetesimals outwards . however , for the outer planet to migrate outwards it must also scatter planetesimals inwards .",
    "the total energy and angular momentum of material scattered outwards by the inner planet must exceed that scattered outward by the outer planet to allow it to migrate outwards .",
    "this is one of the primary reasons why we required a large inner planet mass .",
    "when the outer planet migrates outwards it replenishes a population of moderately eccentric bodies residing between the planets .",
    "this allows the inner planet to continually scatter objects .",
    "as these objects are scattered outwards , they stop interacting with the outer planet allowing it to continue migrating outwards .",
    "previous studies have described migration in terms of two regimes ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if the outer planet migrates at increasing slower rates , its migration is described as `` damped '' ( e.g. , @xcite ) , however if it continues to migrate until it reaches the edge of the disk the migration is considered `` forced '' @xcite .",
    "the planetesimal disks considered here are sufficiently massive that the planet migrates outwards until it is near the edge of the disk .",
    "a comparison between figure [ fig:10000 ] and [ fig:10000-noselfgrav ] , shows little difference between the morphology of the scattering surfaces , however the location of the one associated with the outer planet is at a larger semi - major axis for simulation n1 than c1 .",
    "this is because the outer planet migrates more quickly in the simulation lacking disk self - gravity ( n1 ) than that including self - gravity ( c1 ) .",
    "we will discuss migration rates in the next subsection .",
    "a notable difference between the simulations with and lacking disk self - gravity is the fraction of bodies captured into mean motion resonances with the outer planet . in figure",
    "[ fig : ae15 ] we show simulations c1 and n1 at 557 orbits into their runs ( approximately 15 percent completion ) . we find that the fraction of particles captured into resonances is lower in the simulation with self - gravity than that without .",
    "while an outwardly migrating planet is capable of capturing bodies into mean motion resonances , the fraction of particles captured into resonance can be reduced if the planet is migrating faster or if the initial eccentricity distribution of the disk is larger @xcite .",
    "the lifetime of particles in resonances could be reduced by scattering among the planetesimals or if the planet s motion is stochastic ( e.g. , @xcite ) . because the planet migration rates up to this point in the simulation are not significantly different in the two simulations , we attribute the difference in resonance population to either reduced capture because of a higher initial eccentricity distribution or because of a reduced lifetime in resonance .",

    "these resonant events have been previously seen in other numerical simulations , for example such an event is an important characteristic of the `` nice '' model for the outward migration of the outer planets in the early solar system @xcite .",

    "is higher when self - gravity is absent , as shown in figure [ fig : mig ] showing the total distance traveled by the outer planet after 4000 orbits .",
    "however when we examine the total distance traveled by the outer planet , we note that the self - gravitating simulations have much larger scatter in this quantity than those lacking self gravity .",
    "the planets in the simulations lacking self - gravity tend to have smoother migration excepting when the disk is very massive .    for the most massive disks considered",
