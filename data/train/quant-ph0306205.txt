    "spin squeezed states offer an interesting possibility for reducing quantum noise in precision measurements @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing is described in terms of spin operators that are associated with quantum mechanical operators of two - level atoms ( tla ) ( we refer to atoms and spins interchangeably ) . in an appropriate interaction representation ,",
    "combinations of atomic raising and lowering operators for atom @xmath3 are associated with the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spin components ( @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while the population difference operator for the two states is associated with the @xmath8 spin component ( @xmath9 .",
    "one then defines collective operators @xmath10 that obey the usual spin commutator relations .",
    "if one measures an average spin @xmath11 then the system is said to be spin - squeezed if@xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath0 is the number of atoms @xcite .",
    "spin squeezing is impossible for a single atom and requires the entanglement of the spins of two or more atoms .",
    "there are many ways to theoretically construct a hamiltonian that can give rise to the necessary entanglement among n two - level atoms . since a linear hamiltonian merely rotates the spin components leaving the uncertainties unchanged , it is generally necessary to use hamiltonians that are quadratic in the spin operators to generate squeezing . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to generate squeezing using a hamiltonian linear in the spin operators provided the spin system is coupled to another quantum system , such as a harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is then not surprising to find that a squeezed state of the oscillator can be transferred to some degree to the atoms .",
    "what may be a little more surprising is that an oscillator prepared in a coherent state and coupled to the spins can result in spin squeezing . in this paper",
    ", we study the dynamics of the creation of squeezing in an ensemble of spins via coupling to a cavity field in the tavis - cummings model @xcite .",
    "an ensemble of @xmath0 atoms is coupled in a spatially independent manner to the @xmath0 atoms with no losses for the field and with the neglect of any spontaneous emission for the atoms .",
    "we are concerned mainly with the type of spin squeezing that can be generated by coupling to a radiation field that is initially a coherent state , but also will consider an initial state of the field that is a squeezed state .",
    "the evolution of the radiation field will also be determined .",
    "there have been a number of studies of atom - field dynamics in the tavis - cummings model in which the squeezing of the cavity field was calculated in various limits @xcite .",
    "some numerical solutions to the problem of spin squeezing in the tavis - cummings model are given in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the initial condition for the atoms is taken as one in which all the atoms are in their lower energy state , corresponding to a coherent spin state .",
    "for a very large number of atoms ( @xmath14 and @xmath0 much greater than the average number of photons in the coherent state of the field ) , the relevant energy levels of the spin system approach those of a simple harmonic oscillator with corrections that vanish as @xmath15 .",
    "thus it would seem that spin squeezing can never be achieved if the initial state of the cavity field is a coherent state , since one is dealing with a linear interaction between two harmonic oscillators each of them initially in a coherent state .",
    "nevertheless , we show that for any finite @xmath16 spin squeezing occurs and the degree of spin squeezing actually increases with increasing field strength .    to follow the atom - field dynamics , we consider first a system having @xmath17 .",
    "it is not difficult to obtain analytic solutions in this case , enabling us to track the dependence of @xmath18 on field strength and @xmath0 .",
    "in addition , we determine if the squeezed vacuum state results in optimal transfer of squeezing from the fields to the atoms . after discussing the two atom case , we generalize the results to @xmath0 atoms .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the mathematical framework and obtain results that show that no squeezing can be achieved when the field is either classical , or quantized in a number state . in sec .",
    "iii , we consider the @xmath17 case and obtain analytical results for both coherent and squeezed cavity fields , in the limit that the average number of photons in the field is much less than unity . numerical solutions for larger field strength are presented . in sec .",
    "iv , the results are generalized to @xmath0 atoms . in both sections",
    "iii and iv , the time evolution and squeezing of the field is also calculated for the case that the field is initially in a coherent state . in sec .",
    "v , a formal derivation of the large @xmath0 limit is given using the holstein - primakoff transformation @xcite , valid for an arbitrary strength of the coherent cavity field .",
    "the holstein - primakoff  transformation was used previously by persico and vetri @xcite to analyze the atom - field dynamics in the limit of large @xmath0 .",
    "the approach we follow differs somewhat from theirs and our results seem to have a wider range of validity than that stated by persico and vetri .",
    "the results are summarized in sec .",
    "in dipole and rotating - wave approximations , the hamiltonian for an ensemble of tla ( lower state @xmath19 , upper state @xmath20 transition frequency @xmath21 ) interacting with a resonant cavity field , @xmath22 , is of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24   /2 $ ] , @xmath25 @xmath26 @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are annihilation and creation operators for the field , and @xmath31 is a coupling constant .",
