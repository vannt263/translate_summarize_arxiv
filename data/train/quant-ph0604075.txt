    "<S> the knowledge of quantum phase flow induced under the weyl s association rule by the evolution of heisenberg operators of canonical coordinates and momenta allows to find the evolution of symbols of generic heisenberg operators . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum phase flow curves obey the quantum hamilton s equations and play the role of characteristics . at any fixed level of accuracy of semiclassical expansion </S>",
    "<S> , quantum characteristics can be constructed by solving a coupled system of first - order ordinary differential equations for quantum trajectories and generalized jacobi fields . </S>",
    "<S> classical and quantum constraint systems are discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the phase - space analytic geometry based on the star - product operation can hardly be visualized . </S>",
    "<S> the statement `` quantum trajectory belongs to a constraint submanifold '' can be changed e.g. to the opposite by a unitary transformation . some of relations among quantum objects in phase space are , however , left invariant by unitary transformations and support partly geometric relations of belonging and intersection . </S>",
    "<S> quantum phase flow satisfies the star - composition law and preserves hamiltonian and constraint star - functions . </S>"
