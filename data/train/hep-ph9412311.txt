    "one of the great puzzles of contemporary elementary particle research is whether nature makes use of the higgs mechanism to generate the observed particle masses . in the minimal standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions",
    ", the symmetry breaking is implemented using this mechanism with one weak - isospin doublet of complex scalar fields with weak hypercharge @xmath10 . with the spontaneous breaking of the su(2)@xmath11u(1)@xmath12 gauge symmetry ,",
    "three of the four scalar degrees of freedom are absorbed to create the longitudinal polarization states of the intermediate bosons , @xmath13 and @xmath14 . at the same time , the quarks and charged leptons acquire masses through their yukawa interaction with the scalar doublet .",
    "there remains at the end one neutral scalar boson with positive parity and charge conjugation , the physical higgs boson @xmath1 .",
    "most of the properties of the scalar or higgs sector of the sm are fixed experimentally , e.g. , the vacuum expectation value , @xmath15 , the coupling of the higgs boson to the gauge bosons , @xmath16 where @xmath17 , and the coupling of the higgs to the fermions , @xmath18 . however , the mass @xmath6 of the higgs boson and its quartic self - coupling , @xmath19 , are unspecified .",
    "it is therefore of considerable interest to analyze processes which can give theoretical limits on @xmath6 , or test the effects of the quartic coupling phenomenologically .",
    "the range of possible higgs masses is constrained from below both experimentally and theoretically .",
    "the non - detection of the @xmath14-boson decay @xmath20 at lep  1 and slc has ruled out a higgs mass of less than 63.9  gev at the 95% confidence level @xcite .",
    "depending on the mass of the top quark , the requirement that the vacuum be the true ground state could provide an even more stringent theoretical lower bound @xcite .",
    "other theoretical arguments bound the higgs mass from above .",
    "nonperturbative lattice computations @xcite give an upper limit for @xmath6 of about 710  gev @xcite .",
    "unitarity arguments in intermediate - boson scattering at high energies @xcite and considerations concerning the range of validity of perturbation theory @xcite establish an upper bound @xmath21 in a weakly interacting theory . the unitarity bound on @xmath6 is lowered significantly when the approach of @xcite is extended to higher orders ; see @xcite and references therein . however , the improved bound depends on the energy scale up to which the sm is assumed to remain valid .",
    "a violation of the unitarity bound on @xmath6 is presumably a signal for the onset of strong interactions in the higgs sector of the sm , a possibility which is of considerable interest in its own right @xcite",
    ". it would therefore be desirable to sharpen the bound by removing the uncertainty associated with the mass scale at which it is applied , or to find a separate scale - independent bound . in fact , the work presented here on two - loop electroweak corrections to the fermionic decay modes of the higgs boson , @xmath22 , gives a scale - independent limit on @xmath6 in a weakly interacting theory .",
    "we find that the two - loop corrections to the fermionic decay rates exceed the one - loop corrections in magnitude for @xmath23 , and increase in relative magnitude proportionally to @xmath5 for larger higgs - boson masses .",
    "we conclude , as reported previously @xcite , that the perturbative expansion fails to converge satisfactorily , and that the theory becomes effectively strongly interacting in the higgs sector for @xmath24 .",
    "the result noted above is a consequence of our calculation of the dominant two - loop electroweak corrections to the fermionic decay rates of the higgs boson , the subject of this paper .",
    "the fermionic decay modes are of considerable phenomenological interest .",
    "for example , the higgs boson decays predominantly to @xmath25 pairs if @xmath26 .",
    "the search for a low- or intermediate - mass higgs boson at future high - energy @xmath27 linear colliders @xcite , the fermilab tevatron @xcite , or a possible 4-tev upgrade thereof @xcite will rely largely on this mode by tagging the @xmath28 mesons .",
    "moreover , in this mass range , the branching fractions of all other decay channels depend sensitively on the @xmath29 decay width .",
    "it has been argued that the low - mass higgs boson might also be detectable at future hadron supercolliders through the @xmath30 signal @xcite , while the decay @xmath31 will have an appreciable branching fraction for @xmath32 .",
    "future high - energy @xmath27 colliders will also be able to measure the @xmath33 yukawa coupling @xcite .",
    "the measurement of the higgs - boson mass and couplings in future experiments will require an understanding of the radiative corrections to the fermionic decay rates of the higgs boson .",
    "much work has been done in this area , and a recent review is given in @xcite .",
    "there are important differences between the radiative corrections involved in higgs physics , and those familiar in the gauge sector of the sm , e.g. , in @xmath14-boson decays .",
    "it is well known that the quantum effects induced by virtual higgs bosons are _ screened _ in @xmath14-boson physics @xcite : they depend only logarithmically on @xmath6 at one loop , and are quadratic in @xmath6 , but with minute coefficients , at two loops @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the one - loop electroweak corrections to the partial decay widths @xcite and production cross sections @xcite of the higgs boson are already dominated for @xmath34 by terms quadratic in @xmath6 .",
    "these terms give rise to moderate enhancements of the rates for higgs masses of up to @xmath35 .",
    "however , it is premature to conclude that the two - loop electroweak corrections will also be perturbatively small in the high-@xmath6 range , since these corrections have terms _ quartic _ in @xmath6 .",
    "it is of both theoretical and phenomenological interest to check the importance of these potentially large corrections by explicit calculation .    in this paper , we calculate the complete @xmath0 corrections to the fermionic decay rates of a higgs boson with @xmath34 .",
    "these corrections , which are the leading two - loop electroweak corrections for @xmath34 , are independent of the fermion flavor , and , as noted above , are larger than the one - loop corrections of @xmath36 for @xmath4 .",
    "we compare our results with other known one - loop corrections . to obtain the full electroweak two - loop corrections for specific fermion channels in the limit @xmath34",
    ", one would have to calculate further , flavor - dependent corrections of mixed orders in the higgs and yukawa couplings , namely @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "these corrections , however , are not universal . for example , different fermionic channels , such as @xmath39 , all have different dependence on @xmath40 .",
    "in this section , we sketch the calculation of the dominant , flavor - independent electroweak corrections to the decay rate @xmath22 .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the bare lagrangian for the higgs - fermion interaction ,    @xmath41    where the subscript `` 0 '' denotes bare quantities .",
    "our aim is to obtain the leading , flavor - independent corrections to the @xmath42 vertex in powers of @xmath7 .",
    "the mass and wave - function renormalization constants for the fermions as well as the loop corrections to the vertex depend on the yukawa couplings for the fermions , and are omitted consistently because of their subleading nature .",
    "( we will return to these corrections at the one - loop level in sec .",
    "we may therefore replace the fermionic quantities @xmath43 and @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ eqyuk ] ) by @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the contributions to the renormalization constants for the bare higgs field , @xmath47 , and the bare vacuum expectation value , @xmath48 , in powers of @xmath7 are determined entirely by the symmetry - breaking sector of the sm .",
    "the contributions of fermion loops to these two quantities depend on the yukawa couplings and are again omitted as they do not contribute to the @xmath49 corrections ( see sec .",
    "we may therefore calculate the desired corrections to the decay @xmath50 vertex with all yukawa couplings set to zero .",
    "the calculation can be simplified greatly in the limit of interest , @xmath34 , through the use of the goldstone - boson equivalence theorem @xcite .",
    "this theorem states that the leading electroweak contribution to a graph in powers of @xmath7 can be calculated by replacing the gauge bosons @xmath13 , @xmath14 by the would - be goldstone bosons @xmath2 , @xmath3 of the symmetry - breaking sector of the theory .",
    "because @xmath51 , we can simplify our calculation consistently in the limit of a heavy higgs boson by neglecting the gauge couplings @xmath52 and taking the goldstone bosons to be massless . adopting the conventions of @xcite , we can write the relevant lagrangian for the symmetry - breaking sector of the sm in terms of bare quantities as follows :    @xmath53    where the real scalar triplet , @xmath54 , is related to the goldstone bosons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , by @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "the tadpole counterterm , which cancels all tadpole contributions of @xmath57 order by order , has been omitted in writing eq .",
    "( [ eqlag ] ) ; therefore all graphs which include tadpole contributions need to be dropped in calculations @xcite .",
    "note that a full equivalence - theorem calculation would also require the complete yukawa lagrangian for the interactions of fermions with the massless goldstone bosons and the higgs boson @xcite .",
    "because we are not interested in corrections due to the yukawa couplings we do not give the complete yukawa lagrangian here , except for the piece given in eq .",

    "it is also interesting that the coefficients in @xmath98 alternate in sign ; those in @xmath99 do not .",
    "we note that the results above , revised relative to our previous analysis @xcite , are now in complete agreement with the those of ghinculov @xcite , which have also been revised @xcite .    because the decay width @xmath100 is a physical quantity , and all radiative corrections that depend only on @xmath7 are contained in the factor @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( 2.6 ) , this factor must be finite for @xmath102 .",
    "the @xmath14 s are finite at one loop , but not at two loops .",
    "hence , the parts of the two - loop contributions to @xmath76 and @xmath77 that are proportional to @xmath103 must cancel in the ratio .",
    "the cancellation is clear if the @xmath14 s are written in factored form ,    @xmath104    and is exact to all orders in @xmath84 .",

    "however , it is clear that the resummation contains only limited information on higher - order terms . since we actually have no control of terms beyond @xmath108 , and are not aware of a physical principle which would select this as an optimum resummation scheme , we expand eq .",
    "( [ eqres ] ) and discard terms beyond @xmath109 .",

    "( [ eqexp ] ) .",
    "while the @xmath0 term ( upper solid line in fig .  [ hff_ratio ] ) gives a modest increase of the rates , e.g. , by 11% at @xmath114 , the situation changes when the two - loop term is included .",
    "the importance of this term , which grows as @xmath115 , increases with @xmath6 in such a way that it cancels the one - loop term completely for @xmath116 , and is twice the size of the one - loop term , with the opposite sign , for @xmath117 .",
    "the total correction , shown by the lower solid line in fig .",
    "[ hff_ratio ] , is then negative and has the same magnitude as the one - loop correction alone .",
    "the perturbation series for the corrections to @xmath113 clearly ceases to converge usefully , if at all , for @xmath8 , or equivalently , for @xmath118 .",
    "a higgs boson with a mass larger than about 1100 gev effectively becomes a strongly interacting particle .",
    "conversely , @xmath6 must not exceed approximately 1100  gev if the standard electroweak perturbation theory is to be predictive for the decays @xmath50 .",
    "note that one can not use the usual unitarization schemes invoked in studies of @xmath119 scattering @xcite to restore the predictiveness for the heavy - higgs width , as no unitarity violation is involved .",
    "one might expect to improve the perturbative result in the upper range of @xmath6 somewhat by resumming the one - particle - reducible contributions to the higgs - boson wave - function renormalization by using eq .",
    "( [ eqres ] ) rather than eq .",
    "( [ eqexp ] ) .",
    "this leads to an increase of the one - loop correction ( upper dotted line in fig .  [ hff_ratio ] ) , while the negative effect of the two - loop correction is lessened ( lower dotted line ) for large values of @xmath6 .",
    "however , in the mass range below @xmath120 , this effect is too small to change our conclusions concerning the breakdown of perturbation theory . moreover , the resummed expression for the one - loop terms in the perturbation expansion , when reexpanded to @xmath0 , does not yield a proper estimate for the size of the two - loop terms .",
    "there is consequently no reason to favor this approach to the present problem .",
    "it might be argued that the apparent breakdown in the perturbation expansion as judged by a comparison of the one- and two - loop terms is an artifact of a small one - loop contribution rather than a consequence of large two - loop terms .",
    "however , we see no evidence in the calculation that there are unusual cancellations in the one - loop corrections .",
    "in fact , the one - loop contributions @xmath94 and @xmath95 add in magnitude in the ratio @xmath101 , whereas the two - loop contribution @xmath97 is in magnitude subtracted from @xmath96 [ see eqs .",
    "( [ eqcoeff ] ) and ( [ eqexp ] ) ] .    in a previous publication",

    "even larger coefficients appear in the perturbation expansion when it is expressed , as above , in a series in the ( running ) parameter @xmath121 @xcite . the contributions due to the finite parts of @xmath76 and @xmath77 are rather insignificant in comparison with the finite parts of the unrenormalized two - loop scattering graphs .",
    "while the factors of @xmath122 occur naturally at each order in perturbation theory , their incorporation into the _ natural _",
    "parameter @xmath123 is misleading : the coefficients of the and two - loop terms in the diagonal partial - wave scattering amplitudes , and the one- and two - loop terms in the higgs - boson decay rate calculated above , all have similar magnitudes when the series are rewritten as expansions in the physical parameters @xmath124 and @xmath19 as seen in eq .",
    "( [ percent ] ) and the comment @xcite .",
    "it appears , therefore , that @xmath84 , and not @xmath125 , is the natural expansion parameter .",
    "the high - energy scattering processes give strong evidence for a breakdown of the perturbation series for a running coupling @xmath126 at either the one - loop @xcite or two - loop @xcite level .",
    "this translates to @xmath127 if the sm is _ assumed _ to remain valid for energies @xmath128 up to @xmath129 tev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 upper bound obtained in the present analysis is considerably less stringent than the one found in @xcite .",
    "however , we emphasize that the result obtained here does not depend on the extra assumption about an energy scale ; the breakdown of perturbation theory is fixed solely by the physical value of @xmath6 .",
    "the leading corrections discussed so far are independent of the flavor of the final - state fermion . however , from an experimental point of view , they are relevant only for the @xmath130 and , perhaps , the @xmath131 and @xmath132 decays of the higgs boson .",
    "it is therefore interesting to compare the corrections calculated here with the full one - loop electroweak corrections @xcite , and the qcd corrections that are available for these decay channels @xcite .",
    "in particular , the subleading two - loop electroweak corrections , those of @xmath133 and @xmath134 , are still unknown , but one may estimate their likely importance by comparing the top - quark yukawa - coupling correction to the higgs - coupling correction at one loop .",
    "the qcd corrections to the @xmath135 modes , where @xmath136 denotes a quark flavor , are known to @xmath137 for arbitrary values of @xmath138 @xcite and to @xmath139 in the limit @xmath140 @xcite .",

    ", we mention that the @xmath142 corrections to the fermionic decay rates are also now available @xcite .    the results in the preceding section were derived using the goldstone - boson equivalence theorem and neglecting further electroweak corrections of orders @xmath143 , @xmath144 , etc .",
    ", as well as contributions that involve the yukawa and qcd couplings of the fermions .",
    "since @xmath84 , @xmath143 , @xmath145 , and the yukawa couplings are independent parameters of the theory , our conclusion that the perturbation series in @xmath19 fails to converge satisfactorily is independent of further corrections involving powers of @xmath146 and the other independent couplings , though those further corrections may be numerically important in applications of the results .",

    "a similar pad summation of the partial - wave scattering amplitudes for @xmath187 scattering turns out to give a fairly good prediction for the two - loop contribution in terms of the zero- and one - loop terms @xcite , so the method may be more reliable in this rather similar case than our limited input information would suggest .",
    "if so , the leading electroweak corrections to @xmath50 in powers of @xmath84 or @xmath7 will be negligible , when resummed , relative to the corrections introduced by the yukawa couplings and qcd . only experimental results or reliable nonperturbative calculations",
    "can resolve this speculation .",
    "we note in this connection that recent lattice simulations of certain yukawa models for the interaction of the higgs boson with mirror or reduced staggered fermions suggest that the yukawa couplings can not be strong , unless the regularization scale is unacceptably low @xcite .",
    "in summary , we have calculated the leading two - loop electroweak corrections to the fermionic decay rates of a high - mass higgs boson in the sm , which are of @xmath0 .",
    "the corrections are negative and exceed the positive @xmath36 one - loop corrections in magnitude for @xmath4 . for larger values of @xmath6 ,",
    "the perturbation series is clearly unreliable , and the theory becomes effectively strongly interacting .",
    "we conclude , given the lack of a physical principle that would allow a convincing resummation of the perturbation expansion , that a value @xmath188 has to be considered as a theoretical upper bound on @xmath6 beyond which the fermionic decay width of the higgs can not be calculated perturbatively .",
    "this result is independent of speculations regarding the energy scale up to which the sm is valid , as the center - of - mass energy in the higgs decay is fixed , @xmath189 .",
    "however , there is indication that high - energy interactions in the higgs sector of the sm can become effectively strong , and are not usefully calculable in perturbation theory , for even smaller higgs mass . for scattering processes with @xmath190  tev ,",
    "the critical value for @xmath6 is about @xmath191 gev , and for scattering at gut energies the critical value is less than @xmath192 gev @xcite . clearly , the present - day precision tests of the gauge sector of the sm are not affected by such nonperturbative effects .",
