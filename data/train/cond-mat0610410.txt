    "recently , several researchers have studied generalized forms of fokker - planck equations @xcite .",
    "these equations arise when the coefficients of diffusion , mobility and friction in the usual fokker - planck equations ( kramers , smoluchowski , ... ) explicitly depend on the concentration of particles .",
    "this can take into account phenomenologically `` hidden constraints '' that are not directly accessible to the observer @xcite .",
    "these nonlinear fokker - planck equations are associated with generalized free energy functionals and non - standard distributions .",
    "for example , tsallis @xmath13-distributions constitute an important class of non - boltzmannian distributions @xcite .",
    "plastino & plastino @xcite have shown that they could be obtained as stationary solutions of a nonlinear fokker - planck equation , with potential applications to the context of porous media .",
    "recently , kaniadakis @xcite , frank @xcite and chavanis @xcite have shown that it was possible to construct more general fokker - planck equations leading to other forms of non - standard distributions .",

    "this can be derived from a generalized kramers equation in a strong friction limit @xcite .",
    "the usual smoluchowski equation leading to the boltzmann distribution corresponds to an isothermal equation of state @xmath15 while the tsallis distributions are associated with a polytropic equation of state @xmath2 where @xmath16 plays the role of the tsallis @xmath13-parameter .    in this paper",
    ", we consider the case of a logotropic equation of state @xmath1 where @xmath17 is a positive constant .",

    "this potential can be imposed by an external medium ( in which case @xmath26 is assumed given ) or generated by the particles themselves through the mean - field equation ( [ gs2 ] ) where @xmath27 is a binary potential of interaction .",
    "the generalized smoluchowski equation ( [ gs1 ] ) can be derived from a generalized kramers equation in a strong friction limit @xmath28 by performing a chapman - enskog expansion in terms of the small parameter @xmath29 @xcite or by using a method of moments @xcite .",
    "it can also be directly obtained from the damped barotropic euler equations by neglecting the inertial term in the equation for the velocity @xcite .",

    "therefore , our stability analysis has applications for these two different systems : a brownian gas described by nonlinear fokker - planck equations and a `` normal '' gas described by the euler equations .",
    "since the following stability analysis is very similar to that developed in @xcite for polytropic distributions , we shall only give the main lines of the analysis and refer to @xcite for more details .",
    "the second order variations of @xmath82 are given by @xmath252 restricting ourselves to spherically symmetric perturbations , introducing the quantity @xmath253 through the defining relation @xmath254 and using integrations by parts , we can put the second order variations of @xmath82 in the quadratic form @xmath255 we are thus led to considering the eigenvalue equation @xmath256 and determine when , in the series of equilibria , the eigenvalues pass from positive ( stable ) to negative ( unstable ) values . to that purpose , it is sufficient to determine the point of marginal stability corresponding to @xmath125 . introducing the dimensionless quantities of sec .",

    "it is shown that self - similar solutions exist only for @xmath184 ( otherwise the system tends to a complete polytrope ) .",
    "we note that inequality ( [ self11 ] ) is never satisfied in that case so that the scaling exponent is @xmath20 independant on the dimension .",
    "the results of @xcite are therefore unaltered .",
    "\\(ii ) for @xmath303 , the inequality ( [ self11 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath304 where @xmath305 is a new critical index which does not seem to have been introduced before . in that case , the collapse of the polytropic sp system is similar to the case @xmath298 ( cold system ) and the scaling exponent is @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding scaling profile is known analytically in an implicit form @xcite . finally , for @xmath306 , the scaling exponent is @xmath20 . in particular , for the logotropes with @xmath5 in @xmath18 , the scaling exponent is @xmath22 .",
