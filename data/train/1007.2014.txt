    "cold atomic systems have provided an ideal playground for the experimental studies of the unitary evolution of thermally isolated quantum systems .",
    "@xcite apart from the experimental interest , studies of quantum evolution have shed light on some fundamental questions such as thermalization .",
    "@xcite    a widely - studied scenario is the unitary evolution of a quantum state when the hamiltonian is suddenly changed  a `` quantum quench '' ,  @xcite which has been the subject of many recent studies ( see refs .",
    "[ ] for a few examples ) . a challenging question , which has been addressed theoretically in one dimensional systems , is the evolution of the entanglement entropy following the quench .",
    "@xcite more generally , such studies are concerned with the fate of an out - of - equilibrium quantum state with a hamiltonian that changes with some time - dependent protocol .",
    "the case where the coupling constants are changed across a quantum phase transition is of special interest . in recent experiments with spinor condensates , for example",
    ", the formation of ferromagnetic domains was observed in a quench to a hamiltonian with a symmetry - breaking ferromagnetic ground state .",
    "@xcite even though the interactions after the quench favor a certain type of order , it is not at all obvious that the order should emerge out of equilibrium . since symmetry - breaking order has a local order parameter , the non - equilibrium state can support the formation of ordered domains .",
    "but what about quenches across a topological phase transition ?",
    "would any of the topological characteristics of the equilibrium phase show up in the non - equilibrium wave - function ?",
    "another interesting aspect of the non - equilibrium dynamics is the issue of thermalization and whether a large system can act as an effective heat bath for its subsystems .",
    "if thermalization occurs , due to the presence of some excess energy , the non - equilibrium state at long times should be in some sense _ close _ to a thermal state at a finite temperature , which implies volume scaling for the entanglement entropy .",
    "the qualitative discussions above motivate a detailed analysis of a quantum quench across a topological phase transition into the topological phase .",
    "we study the specific case of the kitaev toric code model  @xcite with spin - polarized initial states . a related quantum quench problem with topologically ordered initial states",
    "was recently studied numerically in ref .",
    "we focus on the time evolution of the entanglement entropy because it is intimately related to topological order through the topological entanglement entropy .",
    "@xcite entanglement entropy is also related to thermalization since , as mentioned above , volume scaling of the entropy as opposed to the area law is generically expected of thermal states .",
    "we compute exactly the bipartite entanglement entropy as a function of time .",
    "this is an example where exact calculation can be done in 2 + 1d ( thus far , analytical results for the time - evolution of entanglement had focused on 1 + 1d systems ) .",
    "we show that the entanglement entropy respects the area law at all times and if one adds disorder to the coupling constants , the recurrences or revivals are suppressed at long times and the entanglement entropy per unit `` area '' ( boundary length ) @xmath0 equals @xmath1 in the thermodynamic limit when the initial polarization is in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 direction .",
    "we find the dependence of this saturation value on the initial state for an arbitrary direction of the initial magnetization . a new ingredient that comes in when considering these initial states is order - one corrections to the entanglement entropy from the convex and concave corners in the subsystem boundary .",
    "we find that the general form of the generated entanglement entropy is given by @xmath4 where @xmath0 is the perimeter of the subsystem and @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) the number of convex ( concave ) corners in its boundary .",
    "the functions of time @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are independent of the subsystem geometry .",
    "from the form of the entanglement entropy above , we find that the topological entropy vanishes at all times .",
    "we study the effects of breaking the integrability in a perturbative approach .",
    "we identify the mechanism by which an integrability - breaking magnetic field can change the area law to the volume law as expected of thermalized states .",
    "the physical picture is that the area law survives at low orders in an expansion in the integrability - breaking field .",
    "going to higher orders however increases the thickness of a ring - like region around the subsystem boundary that contributes to the entanglement entropy . eventually at high enough orders , the ring will collapse onto itself making volume scaling possible . in the perturbative treatment , we explicitly find that the topological entanglement entropy remains zero at low orders .",
    "we expect that the excess energy and the finite density of defects should prevent the formation of any topological order in a sudden quench even if one breaks the integrability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : quenchesxz ] we discuss quantum quenches for spin - polarized initial states in the @xmath2 or @xmath3 direction .",
    "we calculate the entanglement entropy analytically and discuss the effects of disorder in the coupling constants . in section  [ sec : corners ] , we study the role of the sharp corners in the subsystem boundary in the generation of entanglement by exactly calculating the second order renyi entropy for an arbitrary direction of the initial magnetization .",
    "we then discuss the effects of breaking the integrability , which we treat perturbatively , in section  [ sec : non - integrable ] .",
    "we conclude the paper in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "consider the toric code hamiltonian in a field  @xcite    @xmath10    the hilbert space of the above hamiltonian is given by spins living on the bonds of a square lattice on a torus and the sums are over all plaquettes , stars and bonds respectively .",
    "the plaquette and star operators are defined as follows @xmath11 where @xmath12s are the pauli matrices . for the usual kitaev model the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14",
    "are independent of the plaquettes and the stars but here we keep the @xmath15 and @xmath16 indeces to allow for disorder in the couplings .",
    "note that for the model in zero magnetic field ( @xmath17 ) , the ground state is independent of the actual values of the coupling constants @xmath13 and @xmath14 as long as they are all positive",
    ".    one can study the dynamics of this model by changing the coefficients @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath18 in time with some protocol . in this section ,",
    "we consider a quantum quench where the system is initially in a fully magnetized state and then evolves with the integrable toric code hamiltonian , namely , we are initially in the ground state for @xmath19 and @xmath20 for all stars and plaquettes .",
    "we then turn off the field @xmath18 at @xmath21 ( which does not change the quantum state ) and turn on the toric code part of the hamiltonian as follows : @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "consider for now , the case where @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the ground state of the usual model ( without disorder in the couplings ) exhibits a topological phase transition : for @xmath27 the system is a paramagnet and for @xmath28 , it is topologically ordered .",
    "this topological phase is robust against weak disorder in the couplings .",
    "let us call the initial state @xmath29 .",
    "in the case where the initial magnetization is in the @xmath2 direction @xmath30 in the @xmath31 basis . the initial state is a tensor product of single spin states and thus has no entanglement .    in the paramagnetic initial state",
    "we have @xmath32 for all spin operators . before addressing the question of the entanglement",
    "entropy evolution , let us consider the simple problem of what happens to the @xmath33 expectation value . as a function of time , we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the evolution operator given by @xmath36 since all star and plaquettes commute with one another , we have dropped the time ordering operator .",
    "if we consider a sudden quench , we have @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "let us focus on sudden quenches for a more compact notation .",
    "at the end of the calculation we can replace @xmath39 and @xmath40 with the corresponding integrals over time - dependent couplings for a more general protocol .    the expectation value of @xmath41 , a spin between two nearest - neighbor plaquettes @xmath15 and @xmath42 is then given by @xmath43 we have @xmath44 .",
    "therefore we get @xmath45 in the completely clean case ( a theoretical abstraction ) , the average of @xmath46 over time is equal to @xmath47 but any amount of disorder will eventually lead to a state which unlike the initial paramagnet has a vanishing time - averaged expectation value for @xmath33 .",
    "we next consider the main problem of this section , namely the evolution of the entanglement entropy .",
    "the density matrix of the system can be written as @xmath48 where @xmath35 is the time evolution operator and @xmath49 is a generic initial state . by inserting the resolution of identity twice , we can write , @xmath50 and @xmath51 . any star or plaquette operator acts on four spins which may all belong to @xmath52 , all belong to @xmath51 or some belong to @xmath52 and some to @xmath51 .",
    "in this last case , the star or plaquette operator must lie at the boundary of the two subsystems .",
    "we can then write @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 only act on spins in @xmath52 and @xmath51 respectively and @xmath56 only depends on star and plaquette operators at the boundary of the two subsystems .",
    "the three operators @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 commute with one another . each basis state can be written as the tensor product of states for spins in @xmath52 and @xmath51 , @xmath57 .",
    "we now integrate out the spins in @xmath51 to find the reduced density matrix for subsystem @xmath52 , @xmath58 and obtain , @xmath59 by @xmath60 in the above expression .",
    "this amounts to calculating the trace in a rotated basis .",
    "we then substitute eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : rho_a ] ) above and obtain latexmath:[\\[\\rho_a(t)=\\sum_{\\alpha_a , \\sigma_a , \\beta_b } \\langle \\alpha_a \\beta_b | u_a u_\\partial|\\omega\\rangle \\langle \\omega | u_a^\\dag u_\\partial^\\dag | \\sigma_a \\beta_b \\rangle    that only acts on @xmath51 spins has no effect on the time evolution of the reduced density matrix for subsystem @xmath52 .",
    "in order to calculate the entanglement entropy between the two subsystems we need to find @xmath62 . we give a replica index to @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath12 and drop the subsystem index for brevity .",
    "states @xmath65 are in subsystem @xmath52 and @xmath66 in @xmath51 . using @xmath67 we obtain , @xmath68 with @xmath69",
    "once again because traces are basis - independent we can replace @xmath65 by @xmath70 in the above equation and we obtain an expression for @xmath62 that only depends on @xmath56 and not the whole @xmath35 .",
    "let us define the following commuting operators @xmath71 where @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) is the set of all boundary plaquettes ( stars ) which act on both @xmath52 and @xmath51 spins .",
    "we then obtain @xmath74 with @xmath69 .",
    "we now focus on the simple case where initially all spins are aligned in the @xmath2 direction . in this case",
    ", @xmath75 is an eigenstate of @xmath76 and we can therefore substitute @xmath77 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr_rho_a_2 ] ) above .",
    "also @xmath78 and @xmath79 are chosen in the @xmath33 basis so the action of @xmath80 on a basis state is to flip the four spins around the plaquette @xmath15 . for concreteness , we assume that the partition @xmath51 contains all spins which lie inside a simply connected @xmath81 rectangular region .",
    "we then have @xmath82 boundary plaquettes .",
    "let us consider the action of @xmath83 on a state @xmath84 . since @xmath85 , we have @xmath86    notice that @xmath87 only if the state the state @xmath88 is obtained by acting with a certain number of @xmath72 plaquette flips on @xmath89 .",
    "let us consider then ising spin variables living at the center of @xmath72 plaquettes .",
    "a plaquette is flipped for @xmath90 and not flipped for @xmath91 .",
    "notice that , on a torus , flipping a certain set of plaquettes @xmath92 and flipping all other plaquettes that do not belong to @xmath92 have the same effect on the spins , i.e. they describe the same element in the group of plaquette flips .",
    "however , since we have eliminated @xmath54 and @xmath55 from the formulation of the problem by a basis rotation , we can uniquely specify a state with nonvanishing @xmath93 by a set of flipped _ boundary _ plaquettes .",
    "let the state @xmath94 be labeled by @xmath95 for @xmath96 .",
    "if the partitions are not too small , it is not possible for a set of boundary plaquette flips acting on @xmath97 to create a state with the same @xmath51 spins and different @xmath52 spins or vice versa .",
    "therefore @xmath98 and we obtain using eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr_rho_a_2 ] ) @xmath99 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : upm ] ) we find that @xmath100 is a product of terms that are equal to @xmath101 for each unflipped plaquette with @xmath102 and @xmath103 for each flipped plaquette with @xmath104 .",
    "we can then write @xmath105 switching the order of the sum and product after plugging eq .",
    "( [ eq : matrix - element ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : trace - rho - n - x ] ) , we obtain @xmath106 we have used the fact that for @xmath107 , @xmath108 .",
    "summing over @xmath109 for each boundary plaquette simply gives @xmath110.\\ ] ] by analytic continuation of @xmath111 , we write the entanglement entropy as @xmath112 and we finally obtain , @xmath113.\\ ] ] for the clean kitaev model , the entanglement entropy is an oscillatory function of time whose maximum is proportional to the number of boundary plaquettes or the perimeter of the subsystem .",
    "for this initial condition , the star term in the toric code hamiltonian has no effect on the evolution of the entanglement entropy because the initial state is an eigenstate of that term .",
    "similarly if initially all spins are in the @xmath3 direction , the plaquette term will have no effect .",
    "the completely clean system will never reach a steady state .",
    "if there is some disorder in the coupling constants however , the entanglement entropy per unit boundary length will saturate to a steady state value in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "suppose the number of boundary plaquettes @xmath0 is very large .",
    "as @xmath114 , due to the presence of some disorder in couplings @xmath115 , the phases @xmath116 are equally likely to take any value between @xmath117 and @xmath118 modulo @xmath118 .",
    "therefore , taking the thermodynamic limit first we can write @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 is a random variable between @xmath117 and @xmath122 drawn from a uniform distribution . the average entanglement entropy is then given by @xmath123 we have @xmath124 which implies that for any realization of disorder @xmath125 indicating that in the thermodynamic limit , the entanglement per unit area length saturates to a steady - state value @xmath126 .",
    "notice that these results , namely the survival of area law at all times and the oscillatory behavior in the entanglement entropy in the absence of disorder are generic features of integrable quenches where the integrals of motion are operators with local support .",
    "the entanglement entropy per unit boundary length relaxes in the thermodynamic limit to a steady state value in the presence of disorder in the coupling constants .",
    "because the system can reach a steady state , it is natural to ask if the steady state of a subsystem has the properties of a thermalized state described by a gibbs or a generalized gibbs ensemble .",
    "@xcite for such thermalized states however , we expect the entanglement entropy of a small subsystem to scale as its volume in the limit of long times .",
    "the survival of the area law at all times which follows trivially from having local integrals of motion indicates the absence of thermalization even to a generalized gibbs ensemble .",
    "let us now consider a more generic case where the initial density matrix is not diagonal in either @xmath33 or @xmath127 basis and both terms in the kitaev hamiltonian affect the entanglement dynamics .",
    "we find that even though in the thermodynamic limit the area law still applies , the physics of the out of equilibrium entanglement is much richer .",
    "we find that here there are order - one corrections to the entanglement entropy from the concave and convex corners of the subsystem .",
    "subleading corrections to the entanglement entropy arising form the sharp corners in the boundary were found before for _ static _ entanglement entropy in the logarithmic corrections to the area law in a class of conformal quantum critical points .",
    "@xcite here we find that corners can also make subleading contributions to the _ dynamical _ entanglement .",
    "we find that when subsystem @xmath51 consists of spins inside a region with @xmath5 convex and @xmath6 concave corners as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ] , the entanglement entropy after a quantum quench behaves as @xmath128 where @xmath0 is the perimeter of the subsystem and @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are functions of time that do not depend on the subsystem geometry .    for a subsystem with a mostly smooth boundary and only a few sharp corners ,",
    "the leading term is the @xmath129 but for a subsystem with a corrugated boundary , the entanglement entropy can be different in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "notice that the number of concave and convex corners are not independent .",
    "suppose subsystem @xmath51 consists of spins inside of an area with @xmath130 connected regions , each with a certain number of handles such that the total number handles is @xmath131 .",
    "as an example in fig .",
    "[ fig : corners ] , we have @xmath132 and @xmath133 .",
    "we argue that @xmath134 this is because for a rectangular simply connected region , we have @xmath135 and @xmath136 and transforming the shape by adding or subtracting plaquettes on the square lattice does not change @xmath137 .",
    "therefore each simply connected region makes a contribution of @xmath138 to @xmath139 and by a similar argument , each hole contributes @xmath140 .      to see how the contribution from sharp corners comes in ,",
    "consider an initial state with all the spins in the positive @xmath141 direction .",
    "let us work in the the @xmath142 basis with @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the action of a star or plaquette operator in this basis is then to flip the corresponding four @xmath142 spins modulo a phase factor of @xmath146 from @xmath80 .",
    "we will see later that this sign has no effect on the entanglement entropy .",
    "we assume for simplicity that there is a minimum distance of @xmath147 times the lattice spacing between all corners .",
    "consider a convex corner as in the right hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : ycorner ] .",
    "the @xmath64 spins live in the dashed blue ( color online ) bonds and the @xmath63 spins on the solid black bonds .",
    "flipping the corner plaquette represented by a red square has the same effect on @xmath64 spins as flipping the two boundary stars represented by red crosses .",
    "these operations of course have a different effect on @xmath63 spins .",
    "because we assumed a minimum distance between the corners , these corner star and plaquette operators uniquely correspond to one corner .",
    "similarly as in the left hand side of fig .",
    "[ fig : ycorner ] , flipping the corner star at a concave corner has the same effect on the @xmath63 spins as flipping the two corresponding plaquettes .",
    "we see from this discussion that the effects of stars and plaquette flips mix at the corners , which leads to a different entanglement generation than along a smooth boundary .",
    "the details of the derivation will be given in appendix  [ app_a ] .",
    "let us write for now the result for the entanglement entropy for a subsystem @xmath51 consisting of the bonds inside an @xmath148 rectangular region . a boundary star or plaquette that is not located at a corner is refereed to as a regular star or plaquette .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ycorner ] , at each convex corner , one plaquette and two stars are special . for our @xmath149 subsystem , we have four convex corners , @xmath150 regular boundary plaquettes and @xmath151 regular boundary stars and the entanglement entropy for a clean system after a sudden quench is given by @xmath152 where the contributions from regular plaquettes ( @xmath153 ) , regular stars ( @xmath154 ) and convex corners ( @xmath155 ) are given by @xmath156 \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath157 the above solution conforms to the generic form eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy - corners ] ) for @xmath158 , @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath159 and @xmath160 .    in appendix",
    "[ app_a ] , we give a derivation of the above result in the more general setting of an arbitrary subsystem geometry .",
    "if instead of a sudden quench we turn on the coupling constants with some protocol @xmath161 and @xmath162 , we just need to replace @xmath39 and @xmath40 by their integrals over time .    using the partitions of ref .  , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : partitions ] , the topological entanglement entropy is given by @xmath163 from the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy - corners ] ) , we can then see that although there are order - one corrections to the area law , the topological entanglement entropy remains exactly zero at all times independently of how the toric code hamiltonian is turned on .",
    "it seems plausible that for _ any _ initial state , as long as the integrability is not broken ( with a field @xmath18 for example ) , evolution with the kitaev hamiltonian does not change the topological entanglement entropy for any time dependence of the coupling constants .",
    "this is because this integrable evolution does not allow propagation of information .",
    "the von neumann entropy is a special case ( limit of @xmath164 ) of the order @xmath111 renyi entropy defined as @xmath165 hereafter we refer to the second order ( @xmath166 ) renyi entropy as the renyi entropy .",
    "the renyi  entropy @xmath167 is simpler to calculate than the von neumann entropy and is an equally valid measure of entanglement .",
    "it has been shown that the topological entanglement entropy calculated by any order renyi entropy contains the same information in the abelean topological phases  @xcite such as the toric code .",
    "for an integrable quench from a paramagnetic state with magnetization in an arbitrary direction , we exactly calculate the renyi entropy @xmath168 .",
    "we consider the clean case with position - independent coupling constants .",
    "with disorder in the couplings , the entropy saturates to the time - average of the clean case similarly to the simpler initial conditions considered before .    in the @xmath169 basis",
    ", an arbitrary paramagnetic state can be written as @xmath170 the calculation is rather involved and is done by a transfer matrix method explained in appendix  [ app_b ] .",
    "we find the same general features for an arbitrary initial magnetization as for the initial magnetization in the @xmath141 direction .",
    "let us summarize these features below .",
    "the renyi entropy can be written as a sum of contributions from the perimeter of the subsystem as well as the convex and concave corners .",
    "these contributions are oscillatory functions of time in the absence of disorder in the couplings which at long times , saturate to the values given by the time - average of the clean case if we have some disorder in the couplings .",
    "the saturation values are independent of the final coupling constants and the protocol used for turning them on .",
    "they do however depend on the initial state .    for a large subsystem with only a few sharp corners ,",
    "the leading term for the renyi entropy is the first term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropy - corners ] ) , namely @xmath171 .",
    "the saturation value of the renyi entropy per unit boundary length is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : plot ] as a function of the @xmath172 and @xmath173 angles which determine the initial state through @xmath174 and @xmath175 .",
    "notice that this saturation value is a unique function of @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "to study the effects of breaking the integrability , we focus on one simple case .",
    "namely , we start with a state that has all spins aligned in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "as opposed to the integrable case where the magnetic field is turned off before turning on the integrable toric code hamiltonian , the the toric code hamiltonian is turned on in the presence of a small magnetic field @xmath18 .",
    "we can not perform exact analytical calculations in this case .",
    "we can however discuss the effects of the magnetic field by calculating a formal expansion for the ( renyi ) entanglement and topological entropies in powers of @xmath18 .",
    "the expansion can only be considered as a perturbative treatment if the toric code coupling constants are quickly pushed above @xmath18 and the time scales considered are not too large .",
    "two main insights are derived from this analysis .",
    "first we find indications as to how breaking the integrability can eventually lead to volume scaling in the entanglement entropy .",
    "the physical picture is that in the expansion in powers of @xmath18 , the contribution to the entanglement entropy comes from ring - shaped areas around the subsystem boundary whose thickness grows at higher and higher orders in @xmath18 . eventually ,",
    "at a high enough order , these correlated regions meet and the terms in the expansion no longer respect the area law . even for a small @xmath18 ,",
    "these high order terms become important at long times making volume scaling of the entanglement entropy possible as expected of thermalized states . secondly",
    ", we find that in this expansion in powers of @xmath18 , the topological entanglement entropy remains zero at low orders until we reach an order proportional to the system size , suggesting that a small integrability - breaking term is not enough for generating topological entanglement .",
    "a useful notion that we introduce in this section is the entanglement entropy in the interaction picture .",
    "we are used to the shcrdinger , heisenberg and interaction pictures for calculating the expectation values of observables , which are of course independent of the picture .",
    "if one defines the entanglement entropy as a property of the wave function alone , then since the wave function does not change in the heisenberg picture , calculating the entanglement entropy in that picture leads to the nonsensical result that time evolution does not change the entanglement of a quantum state . an interesting alternative is to try and define the entanglement entropy entirely in terms of the correlation functions of appropriate operators .",
    "we do not pursue this path here .",
    "we argue instead that as explained below , the entanglement entropy calculated only from the wave function in the interaction picture can be a useful concept .",
    "let us first consider a _",
    "non - interacting _",
    "hamiltonian @xmath178 such as a paramagnet .",
    "consider a partitioning of the system into subsystems @xmath52 and @xmath51 .",
    "the evolution operator for @xmath178 can be written as @xmath179 where @xmath180 ( @xmath181 ) only acts on the degrees of freedom in @xmath52 ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "notice that acting with @xmath182 on any wave function does not change its entanglement properties .",
    "now consider a hamiltonian @xmath183 with the corresponding evolution operator @xmath184 .",
    "the wave functions at time @xmath185 in the schrdinger and interaction pictures are respectively given by @xmath186 now since acting with @xmath187 or @xmath188 on any wave function does not change its entanglement , the interaction picture wave function has the same entanglement entropy as the schrdinger picture .",
    "note however the calculation may be much simpler in the interaction picture .    in the discussion above , we made use of the interaction picture entanglement entropy because we had a hamiltonian @xmath178 whose evolution operator did not change the entanglement entropy . at the next level of complexity , where using the interaction picture wave function may be useful for calculating the entanglement entropy , the evolution operator of the _ unperturbed _ hamiltonian ( @xmath187 ) may have another known property .",
    "for example it may only create entanglement entropy scaling with the subsystem area or it could be incapable of changing the topological entanglement .",
    "this is the case for the integrable toric code hamiltonian .",
