    "the characteristic feature of the physical processes in the early universe is a peculiar interplay of gravity and microscopic physics .",
    "gravity introduces the _ hubble time parameter _ @xmath1 that indicates the timescale on which the global properties of the universe ( geometry , temperature , etc . ) change significantly . the hubble time is determined solely by the energy density of the matter filling the space",
    "the microscopic matter constituents , particles , are involved in the interaction processes , that are believed to be described fundamentally by three known forces  electromagnetic , weak and strong . as long as the timescale @xmath2 of any given microscopic physical process is much smaller than @xmath1",
    ", the expansion can be neglected on that timescale . if time @xmath2 is enough to establish thermal equilibrium between the particles , then the equilibrium it maintained in the course of the universe expansion , while @xmath3 holds . when this inequality ceases to hold",
    ", the state of equilibrium is lost .",
    "the main reason for that is that interparticle distances become larger , while the corresponding densities become lower , hence interactions are less likely to occur .    in this paper",
    "we are consider the formation of light nuclei in the primordial environment  big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "all three fundamental interactions are important for this phenomenon , all playing different roles .",
    "charged particles together with photons are subject to electromagnetic forces and the equilibration timescale of corresponding processes is tiny with respect to the expansion time .",
    "therefore the particles are kept in thermal equilibrium at the common temperature @xmath4 . due to expansion",
    "the temperature is _ decreasing _ with time .",
    "the equilibration time of the weak interactions changes abruptly so that at @xmath5 weakly interacting neutral particles ( neutrinos and neutrons ) stay in equilibrium , while at lower temperatures they fall out of it ( freeze out ) .    at high temperatures processes like @xmath6",
    "maintain _ chemical _ equilibrium , that is the neutron - to - proton conversion exhibits the same finite intensity as the opposite processes .",
    "chemical and thermal equilibria are interconnected , so they are lost simultaneously , when neutron - to - proton ratio freezes out . finally , the strong interactions are responsible for the production of nuclei comprising more than one nucleon .",
    "the most important fusion reaction for the formation of the first nucleus , deuteron , @xmath7 , _ releases _ energy of at least the binding energy of deuteron @xmath8 , and proceeds effectively in dense primordial medium . at temperatures of the order of @xmath9 ,",
    "however , energetic photons collide with deuteron and lead to its destruction .",
    "as baryon density is much lower than the density of photons  @xcite , there are _ many _ photons with energies much higher than @xmath9 that collide with deuterons and hence postpone the production of the significant deuteron density until the temperature when the photodissociation is not effective anymore , @xmath10 , much lower than the binding energy .",
    "the net abundance of deuterium is , however , non - zero at all times till this moment and is given by the equilibrium boltzmann distribution .",
    "deuterium that is created at lower temperatures , serves as a fuel for the formation of @xmath11he , @xmath12he and other nuclides .",
    "although the times of elements production and the moment of the departure from the chemical @xmath13 equilibrium are well - separated , the former process is very sensitive to the latter .",
    "firstly , the details of the freeze - out set the ratio of the neutron to proton densities , and secondly , the time elapsed between the two moments determines the fraction of neutrons that have decayed since then ( recalling that neutron is an unstable particle ) .",
    "the seminal ideas of the primordial synthesis of light elements were first outlined in the so - called @xmath14 paper , @xcite , published in the late 1940s . since then the theory of big bang nucleosynthesis has evolved and its main predictions were confirmed , making it a well - developed model from both theoretical and observational points of view .",
    "a lot of reviews of the standard bbn scenario and its implication for particle physics models exist ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the predictions of the primordial nucleosynthesis can change once one replaces the standard model of particle physics underlying the processes considered so far by some of its `` beyond the standard model '' ( bsm ) extensions .",

    "sterile neutrinos carry no charges with respect to the standard model gauge groups ( hence the name ) , but via their quadratic _ mixing _ to active neutrinos they effectively participate in weak reactions and at energies much below the mass of the @xmath16-boson their interaction can be described by the analog of the fermi theory with the fermi coupling constant @xmath17 replaced by @xmath18 , where the _ active - sterile mixing angle _ @xmath19 ( see fig .

    "the decay products of the sterile neutrinos are injected into the primordial environment , increasing its temperature and shifting the chemical equilibrium .    in this work",
    "we concentrate on sterile neutrinos with the masses in the mev range , motivated by the recent observations  @xcite that particles with such masses can be responsible simultaneously for neutrino oscillations and generation of baryon and lepton asymmetry of the universe and can influence the subsequent generation of dark matter  @xcite . the corresponding model has been dubbed @xmath22msm ( _ neutrino minimal standard model _ , see  @xcite for review ) .",

    ". they would be relativistic at that time , i.e.  their average momentum would be of the order of temperature , @xmath38 , and their contribution to the number of relativistic neutrino species would be significant , @xmath39 .",
    "in the course of the universe expansion @xmath40 would scale as temperature due to the gravitational redshift , and at some point would become smaller than the mass of sterile neutrino . at that moment",
    "the energy density of sterile neutrinos would start to change with expansion as @xmath41 rather than @xmath42 ( where @xmath43 is a scale - factor ) so that the contribution of these massive particles to the energy density would quickly become dominant , making @xmath44 ( or could even overclose the universe ) before the production of light elements starts .",
    "it contradicts the current bound that puts @xmath45 at @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "additionally , in the @xmath22msm the successful baryogenesis is possible only for the masses of sterile neutrinos above few mev  @xcite .",

    "mev temperatures the medium is homogeneous and the distribution functions are independent of spatial coordinates of particles , and due to isotropy they do not depend on the direction of the particle momentum . that simplifies the description of their evolution and therefore @xmath60 holds .",
    "the goal is to find the distribution functions of all relevant particles and to use them to compute the energy density and pressure as a function of time and scale - factor , closing the system of eqs .",

    "a simple estimate ( see appendix  [ app : neutrino - oscillations ] ) demonstrates that the rates of transitions between neutrinos of different flavours are much faster than weak reactions .",

    "[ eq : oscillation - probabilities ] ) .",
    "as already mentioned , sterile neutrinos interact much more feebly than active neutrinos do . nevertheless , at some high temperature",
    "sterile neutrinos may enter thermal equilibrium . whether this happens or not depends on the thermal history of the universe before the onset of the synthesis.msmmodel at early times ( @xmath91 ) initial densities of sterile neutrinos are negligible  @xcite .",
    "then the neutrinos come into equilibrium at temperature @xmath92 ( typically @xmath93  gev ) and freeze - out at temperatures @xmath94  @xcite .",
    "] even if they were in thermal equilibrium at early times , sterile neutrinos then necessarily decouple at temperatures _ higher _ than those of active neutrino decoupling . if sterile neutrinos were light and stable ( or very long - lived ) , they would be relativistic and propagate freely in the medium , yielding @xmath95 together with active neutrinos ( @xmath96 is the number of sterile neutrinos ) . however , sterile neutrinos decay into active neutrinos and other particles .",
    "the energies of the decay products may be very different from the typical energies of plasma particles .",
    "for particles that equilibrate quickly ( such as electrons or photons ) , this `` injection '' results in the fast redistribution of the energy between all particles in equilibrium and effectively the process looks like a temperature increase ( more precisely , it just slows down the cooling of the universe ) .",
    "but for particles that either are not in equilibrium or are about to fall out of it , such as active neutrinos at few mev , the `` injection '' _ modifies _ the form of their spectra .",
    "the other mass - induced effect is that sterile neutrinos may switch from the relativistic regime ( when their average momentum is larger than mass ) , that is established at large temperatures , to the non - relativistic one , due to the gravitational redshift .    for the quantitative description of sterile neutrino dynamics we utilize the boltzmann equation similar to ( [ eq : boltzmann - equation ] ) , replacing active neutrino everywhere therein by sterile neutrino @xmath97 @xmath98 reactions contributing to the right - hand side together with their probabilities are listed in tables [ tab : sterile - scatterings] of appendix  [ app : matrix - elements ] .",
    "note that we neglect the processes involving baryonic particles .",
    "however , they become important for temperatures near the qcd crossover temperature @xmath99 , when their density is not negligible anymore .",
    "more scattering channels of sterile neutrino would appear and their proper account is involved .",
    "however it seems to be reasonable to assert that the only modification the account will bring is to _ lower _ the decoupling temperature of sterile neutrinos .",
    "oscillation phenomenon does not affect significantly sterile neutrinos and therefore boltzmann equation in its original form ( [ eq : boltzmann - equation - sterile ] ) is still valid , contrary to what we have found out for active neutrinos .",
    "an argument in favor of this statement is explained in appendix [ app : neutrino - oscillations ] .",
    "when sterile neutrino is heavier than muon , the former particle can appear in the decay @xmath100 .",
    "however , the branching fraction of this decay mode does not even reach a percent for masses of sterile neutrino we consider ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore we can neglect influence of both muons and other particles , appearing in the decay .    as a result we have six equations ( [ eq : friedmann - first ] ) ,  ( [ eq : friedmann - second ] ) ,  ( [ eq : boltzmann - equation - oscillations ] ) , and  ( [ eq : boltzmann - equation - sterile ] ) describing primordial plasma at temperatures of interest .",
    "these equations contain six unknowns  scale factor @xmath101 , temperature @xmath102 and four neutrino distribution functions , @xmath103 and @xmath104 .",
    "the system of equations is therefore closed and we have solved it numerically at the step i.      outcome of the nuclear reaction chains is found numerically . for the standard bbn model one of the earlier attempts was made with the code written by l. kawano  @xcite .",
    "however , the program in its original form is inappropriate for the account of the bsm physics , and we modified it for this work .",
    "two technical remarks are in order here .",
    "first , we used the 1992 version of the program  @xcite as a starting point , and not the 1988 one ,  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the integration time steps were taken small enough , so that the integration procedure did not introduce an error , that was compensated as a shift in the resulting value of the @xmath105 , the _ mass fraction _ of the @xmath12he , that is a fraction of the total baryon mass stored in the form of helium-4 ] the so - called `` kernan correction ''  @xcite .",
    "second , the code did not take into account the coulomb and the nucleon finite - mass corrections to weak interaction rates , as well as radiative and finite - temperature effects .",
    "we do not calculate directly these effects , but assume their net result to be in the form of the additive correction , which we took to be @xmath106  @xcite .",
    "the tests described in appendix  [ sec : stand - nucl - model ] demonstrate an agreement of thus modified `` kawano code '' with the results of the other code , parthenope  @xcite , that takes a proper account of these effects .",
    "presence of sterile neutrinos alters the standard dynamics of the temperature and the expansion rate as well as the rates of weak interactions involving neutrons and protons .",
    "these quantities are known from the step i ,",
    "so we have implemented the import of these data . together with the change of @xmath107 indicated above , it has lead to the code , that became an essential tool of step ii in our approach .",
    "the computations of nuclide evolution started from temperatures of several mev , when the chemical equilibrium ceases to hold , up to temperatures @xmath108 .",
    "the observables of the bbn are concentrations , or abundances , of light nuclides dispersed in the cosmos .",
    "the most relevant abundance in our problem is that of @xmath12he , as it is sensitive to the expansion rate of the universe at mev temperatures and neutrino distribution functions .",
    "the presence of sterile neutrinos in plasma typically increases the concentration of @xmath12he , described by @xmath105 .",

    "there are two main methods of experimental determination of primordial helium abundance . the first one is related to the studies of low - metallicity astrophysical environments and extrapolating them to zero metallicity case .",
    "the @xmath105 measurements are known to be dominated by systematic uncertainties .",

    "applying this relation to active neutrinos and using their measured mass differences @xcite @xmath166 , we obtain @xmath167 provided that influence of the surrounding environment on neutrino propagation is neglected .",

    "it means that probabilities @xmath173 to transform from flavour @xmath20 to flavour @xmath174 are oscillating functions of time .",
    "in realistic situation neutrinos do not have a definite momentum but are created in wave packets that are superpositions of states which have one . since oscillation periods are momentum - dependent according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : oscillation - timescale ] ) , each state in the superposition will have his own period .",
    "therefore after sufficiently many periods initial phases characterizing superposition will change , and there is no reason for the phase changes to be correlated with each other .",

    "the difference is that mixing parameters together with masses now depend on properties of the environment . in case of plasma close to equilibrium with no non - trivial conserving charges",

    "so the parameters of the pmns become _ temperature - dependent_. in language of the effective hamiltonian approach the system of three neutrinos is described by the addition of medium potential @xmath185 to the hamiltonian @xmath186 of the system in vacuum @xcite        the medium potential comprises effects of neutrino interactions .",
    "since neutrinos take part only in charged- and neutral - current interactions , matter potential has two terms @xmath189 and @xmath190 , respectively .",
    "all neutrinos couple to neutral currents identically , so @xmath190 is proportional to unit matrix",
    ". therefore this term just renormalizes energy , and does not affect oscillations .",
    "in contrast , the charged - current term is non - diagonal and is present only for @xmath138 .",
    "the reason is that due to abundance of electrons in plasma , @xmath138 couples effectively to charged currents , while at temperatures below the muon s mass there is no significant contribution of muons and tau - leptons to realize coupling of other neutrinos to w boson .",
    "so far we have dropped sterile neutrinos from consideration .",

    "<S> we analyze the influence of sterile neutrinos with the masses in the mev range on the primordial abundances of helium-4 and deuterium . </S>",
    "<S> we solve explicitly the boltzmann equations for all particle species , taking into account neutrino flavour oscillations and demonstrate that the abundances are sensitive _ mostly _ to the sterile neutrino lifetime and only weakly to the way the active - sterile mixing is distributed between flavours . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of these particles also perturbs the spectra of ( decoupled ) neutrinos and heats photons , changing the ratio of neutrino to photon energy density , that can be interpreted as extra neutrino species at the recombination epoch . </S>",
    "<S> we derive upper bounds on the lifetime of sterile neutrinos based on both astrophysical and cosmological measurements of helium-4 and deuterium . </S>",
    "<S> we also demonstrate that the recent results of izotov & thuan  @xcite , who find @xmath0 higher than predicted by the standard primordial nucleosynthesis value of helium-4 abundance , are consistent with the presence in the plasma of sterile neutrinos with the lifetime 0.01  2 seconds . </S>"
