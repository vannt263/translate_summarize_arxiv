    "in recent years , a number of high - contrast companions have been thermally imaged around nearby stars .",
    "one interesting companion is gj  758  b ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter p1 ) . its combination of a sun - like parent star ( spectral type g8v ) only 15.5 pc away @xcite , the close proximity to the star ( projected separation 29au ) , and low surface temperature ( @xmath0600 k ) make it one of the most `` planet - like '' objects available for direct study , acting as a laboratory for current planet formation and evolution theories .",
    "p1 presented two epochs of @xmath3-band imaging of gj  758  b that allowed for proof of common proper motion and a first estimation of physical and orbital properties .",
    "furthermore , a candidate second companion , tentatively called `` gj  758  c '' , was found in one epoch .",
    "recently , @xcite published @xmath4-band data that confirmed the estimated temperature range of b but did not detect `` c '' .",
    "both publications deduced similar results for best - fit orbital parameters ( @xmath5 au , @xmath6 ) .",
    "both also noted that the mass range is @xmath01040 @xmath2 if the full range of main - sequence ages for a sun - like star is considered . in this work ,",
    "we present photometric coverage of gj  758  b in the near infrared ( @xmath7 bands ) with additional photometry in the methane - sensitive ch4s and ch4l narrow - band filters ( see table  [ t : results ] for filter specifications ) , collected with high - contrast imaging techniques at subaru / hiciao , gemini / niri , and keck / nirc2 .",
    "this is used for updating the estimations of physical and orbital parameters of gj 758 b. we report the re - detection of `` gj  758  c '' and the conclusive identification of it as a background star by proper motion .",
    "@xmath3-band observations of gj  758  b were obtained with subaru on november 11 , 2009 . making use of ao188 @xcite coupled with hiciao @xcite as part of the seeds survey @xcite .",
    "the field of view ( fov ) was 20@xmath8@xmath920@xmath8 with a 0@xmath10010 pixel scale .",
    "the total integration time was 906 s.    observations in @xmath11- , @xmath3- , ch4s- , ch4l- , and @xmath12-band were obtained at gemini north with the altair ao system @xcite and niri @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out on 5 different nights between april 27 and may 08 , 2010 , with a 0@xmath10022 pixel scale over a 22@xmath8@xmath922@xmath8 fov .",
    "the total integration times were 900 s , 1800 s , 3810 s , 2220 s , and 2400 s , for the @xmath11- , @xmath3- , ch4s- , ch4l- , and @xmath12- band , respectively .",
    "the nearby star hd 226294 was observed before or after each adi dataset in the same filter to be used as a photometric reference .",
    "we imaged gj  758 in the @xmath13- and @xmath14-bands on august 6 , 2010 using the keck ii ao system @xcite and nirc2 .",
    "the 0@xmath10300 diameter coronagraphic mask was used for the @xmath13 observations to prevent saturation .",
    "images without the mask were also taken , to calibrate the brightness of the star .",
    "for all observations , we avoided the bad quadrant in the nirc2 detector and used the 768@xmath9776 subarray mode with a 0@xmath10010 plate scale .",
    "the integration times were 1800 s and 1995 s for @xmath13 and @xmath15 , respectively.three photometric standard stars ( hd 162208 , hd 161903 , gl 748 ) were observed in both bands .",
    "all data were taken using angular differential imaging ( adi , e.g. @xcite ) with typical field rotations of @xmath030@xmath16 , and the images were reduced with the loci procedure @xcite , using an idl implementation adapted for each of the instruments . for the hiciao data ,",
    "the same procedure as described in p1 was used , including correction for the partial subtraction of companion flux during the loci reduction .",
    "the only practical differences for niri and nirc2 were the image registration procedures , where the niri registration was performed on the basis of cross - correlation of the diffraction spiders , and nirc2 registration was caclulated by centroiding on the stellar psf core , which was non - saturated in the m - band data and non - saturated behind the semi - transparent mask in the @xmath4-band data .",
    "also , for the nirc2 data , high - pass filtering was applied at the same time as the subtraction of a radial profile from the stellar psf in all images , to remove low - frequency spatial variations in the high thermal background of the @xmath4- and @xmath14-band ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "fluxes of all observed targets and standard stars were extracted using aperture photometry .",
    "the reduced images are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : images ] and fig .",
    "[ f : ctest ] .",
    "photometric calibration is of central importance for these data , due to the fact that the @xmath17-photometry of gj  758  a has been flagged as unreliable in 2mass @xcite , and furthermore , for the broad - band filters it is always saturated in niri images , even for the shortest available integration times in subarray mode .",
    "hence , we used the standard star for photometric calibration in all filters , with the exception of ch4s .",
    "those data were taken on apr 29 under photometrically unstable conditions , so that the standard star photometry could nt be trusted . instead , we calibrated the ch4s flux based on the fluxes of the background stars in the gj  758 field in ch4l and ch4s , under the assumption that they are equally bright in both filters , which is reasonable since they are stars and can not exhibit methane absorption .",
    "four background stars were used with a dispersion of 0.19 mag .",
    "the brightness of the background stars in ch4l was calibrated against the standard star .",
    "the resulting absolute magnitudes of gj  758  b are summarized in table [ t : results ] .",
    "gj  758  a has no published @xmath4-band or @xmath14-band magnitudes , thus we use the standard stars to calibrate those values .",
    "all three standard stars give consistent results within 0.1 mag , yielding @xmath18 mag and @xmath19 mag . during the science exposures ,",
    "gj 758 a was unsaturated in the @xmath14-band and so could be used to evaluate the brightness of gj 758 b. in the case of @xmath4 , the star was behind the semi - transparent mask , which makes it unreliable for photometry , hence for this case , standard star photometry was used directly to calibrate the brightness of gj  758  b. the results are in table [ t : results ] .",
    "there are two cases where special circumstances apply : for ch4l , the flux at the position of the companion is visually unconvincing as a point source , and more reminiscent of residual noise from the stellar psf .",
    "it is therefore possible that gj  758  b is systematically overestimated at this wavelength , such that the quoted ch4l flux should rather be regarded as an upper limit rather than the true brightness . in the case of @xmath14-band , there is no visually clear signature of the companion , but aperture photometry was performed on the same location as the @xmath4-band detection .",
    "this yielded an excess flux at the @xmath02@xmath20 level , hence this is a plausible flux of the companion , since its position is known a priori . aside from ch4l and @xmath14 , all detections are @xmath010@xmath20 confidence .",
    "for niri , the photometric error that we calculate is dominated by an uncertainty in the linearity behaviour of the detector at low counts / short integrations , which we estimate could impose an error of at most 20% .",
    "gj  758  b exhibits clear methane absorption .",
    "this is generally expected for objects in the late t - type range , although to a decreased extent if the atmosphere is in chemical non - equilibrium ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "gj 758 a has a metallicity of approximately + 0.2 dex ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "assuming that the companion has the same composition , this super - solar metallicity is likely at least partly responsible for the high flux in @xmath21 . since the commonly used cond models @xcite do not contain any non - solar abundances at the relevant temperature range , we do not use them for model comparison .",
    "instead , we use models based on @xcite extended to colder temperatures ( hubeny & burrows in prep . ) . with our new adopted age range discussed below ,",
    "the feasible values of @xmath22 for the companion are all close to 5.0 , hence we use this as a baseline value in our fitting .",
    "the comparison was done by fitting model spectra to the flux densities of the photometric points , which were derived from the magnitude values using the niri and nirc2 filter transmission curves .",
    "all fluxes were normalized to a distance of 10 pc .",
    "the best - fit value was acquired using the minimized @xmath23 in the photometric bands as the quality metric .",
    "the models cover temperatures of 500700 k in steps of 50 k , @xmath22 of 4.05.0 in steps of 0.5 dex , and metallicities of + 0.0 and + 0.5 dex ( note that the full grid is not covered  in particular , no super - solar abundace models exist below 600 k ) .",
    "the best - fit temperature of this procedure is 600 k , in agreement with previous results .",
    "a metallicity of + 0.5 dex fits better than + 0.0 dex , which is consistent with the metal enrichment expected in the system .",
    "however , since surface gravity and metallicity are largely degenerate for the wavelengths covered by our study and the models are very uncertain , we do not attempt to optimize the fit with respect to either of these quantities . indeed , the models are known to be unable to reproduce various features of other cool companions to stars ( e.g. the hr  8799 planets , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so deriving absolute values from model comparison is of limited relevance .",
    "four examples of model fits are shown in fig .",
    "[ f : spectra ] .",
    "we also make a comparison with field brown dwarfs from @xcite . for this purpose",
    ", we use the j - band absolute brightness @xmath24 mag , and the color @xmath25 , mag , since this should be relatively insensitive to metallicity and gravity .",
    "the companion fits very well to the temperature sequence of the @xcite field dwars in an hr - diagram , among the latest - type brown dwarfs ( t8t9 ) .",
    "the @xmath26 color alone with uncertainties places the companion firmly beyond t5 .",
    "a t8t9 spectral type fits well to the temperature of @xmath0600 k derived from model comparison .    in p1",
    ", we adopted an age range of 0.78.7 gyr , on the basis of a variety of age indicators .",
    "the 0.7 gyr age was based on isochronal fitting by @xcite . however , other isochronal fits have been performed yielding substantially higher ages of several gyr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this indicates that isochronal fitting is inadequate for dating gj 758 , hence we revise our age estimates by removing the isochrone method , which yields a residual age range of @xmath059 gyr ( keeping estimates based on activity and rotation ) . as an additional age determination test",
    ", we have analyzed a high - resolution ( @xmath27@xmath031,500 ) spectrum of gj  758 from the apache point observatory 3.5 m .",
    "we detect no clear evidence of the li i 6708   doublet at an upper limit of @xmath04 m  equivalent width .",
    "if li had been detected , it would have indicated a young age , but the non - detection does not provide a strong lower limit on the age , as it only suggests that gj  758 should be older than the @xmath0100 myr old pleiades cluster @xcite .",
    "we reiterate that age determination of main - sequence sun - like stars is highly uncertain , and that the adopted age range of @xmath059 gyr should not be considered definitive , but merely represents the range of mean ages from methods that are considered sufficiently reliable .",
    "the corresponding range of companion masses from evolutionary models is @xmath03040 @xmath2 .",
    "the most promising avenue for getting a reliable age estimate of gj 758 , and thus a better constraint on the mass of its companion , is likely asteroseismology .",
    "in p1 , we demonstrated the common proper motion of gj  758 and gj  758  b on the basis of two epochs of observation , may 3 , 2009 ( e1 ) and august 6 , 2009 ( e2 ) . in this work ,",
    "we include three additional epochs in our analysis : our data from november 1 , 2009 ( e3 ) and april 29 , 2010 ( e4 ) , as well as the may 27 , 2010 data point from @xcite ( e5 ) .",
    "the keck / nirc2 data from august 2010 ( e6 ) have a narrow field of view excluding the 57 known background stars that were used to fine - tune the pixel scales and rotation angles in our previous observation .",
    "thus , they do not deliver sufficient astrometric accuracy .",
    "figure  [ f : astrometry]a shows the resulting positions of all nearby point sources relative to gj  758 at e1e4 , as well as the data point for gj  758  b in e5 .",
    "the e4 data points represent the mean positions of the sources in the four datasets that reveal gj  758  b , i.e.  the @xmath11 , @xmath3 , @xmath21 , and ch4s data .",
    "the error bars for the hiciao data ( first three epochs ) are based on the pixel size of the hiciao camera , 9.5mas . for the gemini data , the pixel size is 22mas , yielding an error of @xmath28mas@xmath29mas for the combined data points .",
    "these errors are consistent with the scatter of the background star data points around the projected motion path , given the expected contributions from the proper motions of the individual background stars .",
    "for the e5 data point , we assume an isotropic error of 10mas to represent the anisotropic error bars of 5 and 15mas shown in @xcite .",
    "we observe that gj  758  b pursues a trajectory to the northwest consistent with orbital motion relative to gj  758 , clearly setting it apart from the background star trajectory , which is dominated by gj  758 s known parallactic and proper motion .",
    "the source tentatively referred to as `` gj  758  c '' in p1 is found to follow the background star track ; while this was still indistinguishable from orbital motion at the @xmath30 level in november 2009 , the may 2010 data are unambiguous .",
    "this also allows us to identify the candidate signal in @xcite as spurious .      with a total of @xmath31 scalar parameters ( 2 coordinates @xmath9 5 epochs ) , the astrometric data on gj  758  b is now extensive enough to fit synthetic orbital solutions generated by a monte carlo simulation with the least - squares method rather than with the simplified approach previously used in p1 and @xcite .",
    "however , since the curvature of the orbit is not yet measurable , the benefit of this improvement is limited .",
    "we generate a large number ( @xmath32@xmath33 ) of orbital trajectories with random values for eccentricity @xmath34 , inclination @xmath35 , argument of periastron @xmath36 , and longitude of the ascending node @xmath37 .",
    "the distributions are presumed to be flat , except for the inclination , where larger angles are favored proportionately to @xmath38 in order to represent their higher geometric likelihood .",
    "the two remaining orbital parameters , the semimajor axis @xmath39 and the mean anomaly at epoch @xmath40 , are implicitly chosen by defining an anchor point @xmath41 in the projected image plane where the companion is located a given epoch @xmath42 . in order to achieve a high production rate of valid orbital solutions , we choose @xmath42 to be the mean of the five observational epochs , @xmath43 , and generate @xmath41 randomly in a box of 20mas@xmath920mas centered on the mean astrometric coordinates @xmath44 .    in order to evaluate an orbital solution for consistency with the data , we determine the predicted position of the companion at the five epochs and calculate the @xmath23 deviation .",
    "the minimum best fit achieves @xmath45 .",
    "we select the set of orbits with @xmath46 to represent the `` good fits '' .",
    "figure  [ f : astrometry]b illustrates the distribution of semimajor axis @xmath39 , eccentricity @xmath34 and inclination @xmath35 for 2516 `` good fit '' orbits .",
    "the solutions appear to lie in a two - dimensional manifold in the three - dimensional parameter space .",
    "we note that more stringent fitting requirements ( e.g.  @xmath47 ) do not relevantly reduce the size of this manifold , showing that this spread is due to model degeneracy rather than fitting errors .",
    "the degeneracy represents the fact that only the projected position of gj  758  b can be tracked , leaving the line - of - sight component of its position and velocity undetermined . in order to break this degeneracy ,",
    "it is necessary to measure the curvature of the projected orbit . given the typical predicted orbital periods of several centuries , this requires monitoring on time scales of at least a decade .    the numerical results are summarized in table  [ t : results ] . we note that the weighted median eccentricity has dropped from 0.73 in @xcite to 0.56 ; this is because the new epochs e3 and e4 suggest that the previous epochs were overestimating the orbital velocity .",
