    "the problem of quantum dynamics for hamiltonian systems with time - periodic perturbation ( tps ) can be formulated in terms of an equivalent solid - state problem of electron localization on a lattice .",
    "such kinds of connections were discussed for different models in  @xcite ( see also references therein ) .",
    "however , most results are obtained for quantum kicked systems , such as a quantum kicked rotor or a quantum kicked oscillator .",
    "these systems are convenient for both analytical and numerical analysis because instead of differential equations one can use discrete quantum maps . at the same time",
    ", the existence of periodic kicks suggests that the external field involves an infinite number of harmonics with equal amplitudes . in more common physical situations ,",
    "there are only few harmonics in the perturbation .",
    "in particular , such a situation occurs when an ion trapped in a linear ion trap interacts with two laser field with close frequencies  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the internal degree of freedom of the ion ( related to the electron dynamics ) interacts with the vibrational degree of freedom .",
    "this interaction can result in complicated and even chaotic dynamics of the vibrational degree of freedom of the ion .",
    "the analysis of the stability of the ion in this system can be performed using a model of a quantum harmonic oscillator perturbed by a monochromatic wave ( mpo )  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we show that the problem of stability of a mpo can be formulated in terms of localization of an electron in a 2d solid - state system ( sss ) .",
    "the resonance approximation , common in treatment of tpss , is used to reduce the effective dimensionality of the sss in the case of relatively small interaction of the ion with the laser field . in order to compare two completely different systems , a similarity in the formal description of the tps and a space - periodic sss",
    "is exploited .",
    "namely , in the tps we use the time - periodicity of the perturbation and employ a floquet formalism , while in the sss we exploit a space - periodicity and use the bloch theorem .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  i",
    "we describe the mpo model of an ion trapped in a linear ion trap and interacting with two laser fields with close frequencies . in section  ii",
    ", we discuss the general procedure which allows to treat an 1d tps on the same ground as a 2d sss . in the case of a small perturbation ,",
    "the resonance approximation is used in section   iii to decrease the effective dimensionality of the sss from two to one . the localization length in the sss",
    "is estimated in section  iv by calculating the size of the chaotic region in the corresponding tps , in the situation when the interaction between the sites of 2d sss is strong .",
    "concluding remarks are given in conclusion .",
    "in the following  @xcite , we assume that two laser beams , designated the pump ( p ) and the stokes ( s ) , with slightly different frequencies , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , respectively , interact with the ion trapped in a linear ion trap .",
