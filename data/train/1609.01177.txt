    "kontsevich s homological mirror symmetry ( hms ) conjecture @xcite states that two categories associated to a mirror pair are equivalent . for a calabi - yau ( cy )",
    "variety , a mirror is also cy and the conjecture is a quasi - equivalence between the dg category of coherent sheaves over one and the ( derived ) fukaya category of the other one .    for non - cys , mirrors need not to be varieties . for a fano toric variety which we will focus on , its mirror is a landau - ginzburg ( lg ) model , which is a holomorphic function over @xmath0 which can be read from the defining fan of the toric variety @xcite .",
    "fukaya - type ( a - brane ) category for an lg model is known to be the fukaya - seidel category @xcite when the lg - model is a lefschetz fibration .",
