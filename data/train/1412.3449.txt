    "the context of this work is the study of critical metals , that is , of a fermi surface coupled to some gapless bosonic degree of freedom @xcite . in particular , we focus on a fermi surface coupled to a wilson - fisher critical boson .    at very low energy ,",
    "the boson fluctuations are damped by the fermi surface , and the theory flows to a non - relativistic fixed point . however , there are models in which over a substantial energy range the damping effect is negligible , and the boson dynamic is simply that of a wilson - fisher fixed point @xcite .",

    "the magnetic field is nonzero only on a line of sites . for simplicity",
    ", we also go to the extreme limit of an infinite magnetic field , so that the spins of this line are fully polarized . in the extended model , all these spins",
    "are locked to the spin @xmath72 by the infinite coupling @xmath65 , and hence also locked together .",
    "therefore , the simulation boils down to applying the wolff algorithm to the original system with all the couplings @xmath73 between spins on the line set to infinity .",
    "when computing an observable , all the spins involved are first multiplied by the common sign of the spins belonging to the line .",
