    "the formation and evolution of massive galaxies are important components in understanding how the universe evolved .",
    "it is not clear why agn formation takes place at the centres of some galaxies , but it is believed that this occurs as part of the formation of all massive galaxies and jet activity is often associated with agn .",
    "some of the most distant and powerful active galaxies have been observed in the radio band and radio astronomy has been closely connected with cosmology ever since .",
    "radio galaxies with extended lobes are believed to influence a significant fraction of the matter - filled universe @xcite . from observations in x - rays ,",
    "we know there are significant interactions between radio sources and the surrounding gas on scales of several tens to hundreds of kpc from the central agn ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "a denser gas environment may imply a more massive galaxy @xcite , while more massive galaxies also contain more massive black holes at their centres which can generate more powerful jets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". therefore we can expect that there is a connection between the jet properties and their environments .",
    "the aim of our work is to study the behaviour of the properties of the radio jets as a function of their environments and of cosmological redshift .",
    "@xcite split extragalactic radio sources into two classes depending on their large - scale morphologies : fri and frii .",
    "fri objects have bright cores and edge - darkened lobes while frii objects are edge - brightened and contain hotspots .",
    "friis are more luminous than fris with a transition luminosity around @xmath2whz@xmath3sr@xmath3 .",
    "@xcite found that the transition in radio luminosity extends into the optical and friis are preferentially associated with more optically luminous galaxies .",
    "however , the break luminosity between the fr classes increases with increasing optical luminosity of the host galaxies .",
    "the physics leading to the fri - frii transition is not well understood , but may depend on the gas density in the environment ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kb07 ) . in our work",
    ", we only concentrate on the frii - type objects , because we have good analytical models for the evolution of individual objects .",
    "various published samples of radio sources observed at low radio frequencies , such as 3crr @xcite , 6ce @xcite and 7crs @xcite , that are complete down to their flux - limits .",
    "these samples indicate that the comoving density of radio galaxies was higher during the quasar era around redshift @xmath4 as compared to the present epoch ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "optical and hard x - ray observations of powerful agn also reveal a similar trend ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "many analytical models for extragalactic classical double radio sources have been published which characterize radio sources in terms of their dynamics and radio luminosity evolution . in this paper",
    "we use the model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ka97 ) , which showed that the lobes inflated by the jets emerging from the agn grow in a self - similar fashion .",
    "the radio lobe luminosity evolution is given by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter kda ) .",
    "the radio synchrotron emission of the lobes is due to relativistic electrons spiralling in the magnetic field of the lobe .",

    "* hereafter mk ) essentially follow the kda prescription , but differ in the way the relativistic particles are injected from the jet into the lobe and in the treatment of loss terms and particle transport .",
    "thus the radio luminosity evolution from these three models show significant differences . in our work",
    ", we will generate artificial samples by using these three models and compare the results with each other .",
    "one of the most important tools to study the evolution of radio sources is the @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram introduced by @xcite , which uses the two fundamental properties of radio sources : their radio luminosity , @xmath5 , and linear size , @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite pointed out that it is analogous to the hertzsprung - russell diagram for stars .",
    "the source distribution in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane is a result of the intrinsic evolution of individual sources and the cosmological evolution of the source population as a whole . since we may assume that source lifetimes are considerably shorter than the age of the universe , the @xmath5-@xmath6 diagram has been used to place some constraints on the evolution of individual sources @xcite and to look for consistency between data and models ( kda ; brw ; mk ) . in our work",
    ", we will investigate the evolution of radio sources across cosmological epochs , therefore we take into account redshift at the same time and extend to a 3-dimensional @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube .",
    "the purpose of this work is to use the evolutionary model of individual radio sources together with the rlf to generate artificial samples with large numbers of sources . from these artificial samples",
    "we can find the best fitting parameters describing the radio sources and their environments , how the jet properties are distributed and how they evolve over cosmological time scales .",
    "our approach differs from that of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter ka99 ) who assume a birth function to describe the probability of the radio source progenitors becoming active and turning into radio sources .",
    "their intrinsic luminosity evolution is determined by the properties of their jets and the environments the progenitors are located in at some cosmological epoch .",
    "we extend this work by directly using the rlf from w01 as a description of the birth function .",
    "@xcite also investigate the trends of radio galaxy properties with redshift .",
    "the main difference between their work and ours is that they use a model for the radio hotspots leading to steeper tracks in the p - d diagram .",

    "the use of a birth function in ka99 , brw , bw06 and bw07 is designed to provide a good fit of the respective model to the high - luminosity end of the rlf .",
    "our approach uses the rlf directly without the need for a good guess at the birth function .",
    "we compare our results with those of bw06 and @xcite .    in section 2",
    "we describe the rlf generated by w01 . in section 3",
    "we describe the observational samples we use in our work .",

    "we show our simulation results in section 8 and compare the results from different radio emission models in section 9 .",
    "a discussion of the simulation results is performed in section 10 and finally we give our main conclusions in section 11 . throughout the paper we are using a cosmological model with @xmath8kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "to construct our artificial samples we need to know the relative number of objects with a given radio luminosity at a given redshift .",

    "several determinations of @xmath11 at various observing frequencies are available in the literature .",
    "the analytical model we use to connect source parameters with observable source properties models the radio emission of the lobes without the hotspots at the end of the jets .",
    "the emission from the hotspots is most important at high frequencies and may even dominate the total emission . to minimize the effect of the hotspot emission we use the rlf at 151mhz compiled by w01 on the basis of 356 sources from the 3crr @xcite , 6ce @xcite and 7crs @xcite flux - limited samples .",
    "w01 model the rlf as the sum of two distinct populations allowing independent redshift evolution .",

    "is not known . here",
    ", we simply assume that 40% of the sources contributing to the low luminosity part of the rlf are of type frii .",
    "we find below that this assumption allows for a good fit of the properties of our artificial samples to those of the observed samples .",
    "however , the fraction of frii - type sources in @xmath12 may be a function of redshift and/or luminosity .",
    "in fact , in section 8.4.2 below we show that the observed sample with the lowest flux limit we use in this paper , the 7crs sample , requires the frii fraction to increase with increasing redshift .",
    "the advantage of using the rlf directly rather than a birth function is that we can include the weaker friis in the low - luminosity population while the birth functions used by brw , bw06 and bw07 only consider the high - luminosity population which exclusively contains friis .",
    "w01 compute the rlf for a cosmological model with @xmath40kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we adopt the cosmological parameters consistent with the wmap results , @xmath44kms@xmath3mpc@xmath3 , @xmath45 , @xmath10 and @xmath46 .",
    "hence we need to convert the rlf , @xmath47 , to the correct cosmological model using the relation @xcite : @xmath48 where @xmath5 is the luminosity derived for a measured flux and redshift @xmath7 in a specific cosmological model , while @xmath49 is the comoving volume .",

    "we show the adopted rlf in figure [ rlf ] .",
    "flux - limited samples contain all radio sources within a well - defined sky area with radio fluxes above a specified limit at the observing frequency .",
    "the term complete sample refers to a flux - limited sample of radio sources in which the cosmological redshifts of the host galaxies and the linear size of the lobes of all sample members are also measured .",
    "finally , since the model used here only describes sources with frii - type morphologies , we also need to know the classification of each sample member in terms of fr class .",
    "w01 used three complete samples , 3crr , 6ce and 7crs , for the determination of the rlf .",
    "we use the same samples here . however ,",
    "in addition to the measured redshifts and radio luminosities of all sample members necessary for the construction of the rlf , we will also use their measured linear sizes .",
    "the luminosity - redshift distribution of the frii - type objects contained in the three samples is shown in figure [ sample ] .",
    "note the range in radio luminosity covered by the samples at a given redshift . below we will also use the complete brl sample @xcite to estimate the goodness of fit of our models .",
    "we do not directly use the brl sample to constrain our models because its flux limit is defined at 408mhz , significantly higher than the observing frequency of the rlf we use to construct our models .",
    "below we briefly describe the samples we use in this paper .",
    "the third cambridge revised revised sample ( 3crr ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) covers the largest sky area ( @xmath53sr ) of all the samples used here , but it is also the shallowest .",
    "its flux - limit of @xmath54jy is defined at 178mhz rather than 151mhz , the observing frequency of the rlf we use .",
    "the sample contains 146 frii - type sources . to convert the flux limit as well as the fluxes of individual objects from 178mhz to 151mhz",
    "w01 simply assume a typical spectral index of -0.8 and we follow this prescription .",
    "the flux limit therefore translates to 12.4jy at 151mhz .",
    "we use the redshifts , angular sizes and luminosities of sample members listed online by willott at www.science.uottawa.ca/@xmath55cwillott/3crr/3crr.html .",
    "the sixth cambridge sample ( 6ce ) defined by @xcite is based on the 6c survey .",
    "it was re - selected and updated by @xcite .",
    "the radio flux at 151mhz of sources in this sample falls in the range @xmath56jy .",
    "note that 6ce is the only sample that has an upper as well as a lower flux limit .",
    "the area covered by the sample is @xmath57sr .",
    "there are 52 frii - type sources in this sample .",
    "we use the redshifts and luminosities of sample members as published in @xcite , while the angular sizes of the sources are taken from @xcite .",
    "the seventh cambridge redshift survey ( 7crs ) is a combination of the sub - divisions i , ii and iii of the original 7c survey @xcite .",
    "the sample is observed at @xmath58mhz and contains every source with a flux - density @xmath59jy in three regions of the sky covering a total of 0.022sr .",
    "the data relevant for this work for the third field of the sample can be found in table 9 of @xcite .",
    "the data for the first and second fields of the sample is referred to , but not published , by @xcite and can be obtained from www-astro.physics.ox.ac.uk/@xmath55sr/grimes.html .",
    "the classification of sources in the 7c - i and 7c - ii sub - fields of the sample into fr types has not been published .",
    "we obtained the relevant data from the vla archive to repeat the fr classification .",
    "the raw data was reduced using standard routines within aips . within the 7c - i and 7c - ii fields we find 11 sources of type fri , 52 sources with an frii - type morphology and 11 compact sources .",
    "the compact sources are unresolved in all of the archival data down to an angular size of 0.5arcsec . to prevent problems in the construction of our artificial samples , we exclude any artificial sources with linear sizes corresponding to this smallest resolvable angular size or smaller .",
    "we list our source classification for the 7c - i and 7c - ii fields in table 1 and 2 .

    "translates to a limit close to that of the 3crr sample at 178mhz .",
    "thus the brl sample allows us to estimate the similarity of samples drawn from the same parent population with similar selection criteria , but in different parts of the sky .",
    "however , given the large difference in observing frequency we do not attempt to fit the blr sample directly with our model .",
    "the brl sample contains 178 sources , 124 of which have an frii - type morphology .",
    "we use the rlf derived from observations to constrain the number of sources in our artificial samples with a given radio luminosity at a specified redshift . therefore , by construction , our artificial samples agree with the two - dimensional distribution of radio luminosities , @xmath5 , and redshifts , @xmath7 , the rlf , or @xmath5-@xmath7 diagram , of the observed complete samples .",
    "however , the complete samples also contain the measured linear sizes of the radio lobes and therefore represent a three - dimensional data cube with the axes radio luminosity , @xmath5 , linear size , @xmath6 , and redshift , @xmath7 .",
    "to agree with the observational constraints , our artificial samples must provide a good fit to the observed source distribution in the full @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube .",
    "previous work has concentrated on two - dimensional projections of the full data cube of varying subsets of the three samples we discuss here ( e.g. subramanian & swarup 1990 ; neeser et al . 1995 ; ka99 ; brw ; arshakian & longair 2000 ; w01 ; mk ; grimes et al . 2004 ; bw06 and bw07 ) . in this paper",
    "we use the full three - dimensional data cube to constrain the models to avoid the loss of information associated with the projection process .",
    "brw , bw06 and bw07 also considered the radio spectral index as a fourth parameter .",
    "they found that the observed distribution of the spectral index is not well fitted .",
    "they use the same models for the evolution of radio sources that we employ in this paper .",
    "the models significantly restrict the possible range of the spectral index and this effect naturally explains the difficulties encountered by bw06 and bw07 . here",
    "we do not attempt to reproduce the observed distribution of spectral indices as this would either result in the same problem or require the introduction of an additional model parameter .",
    "we will return to this point below .",
    "the large - scale structure of frii - type sources is inflated by powerful jets accelerated in the vicinity of the supermassive black holes at the centre of the agn inside the host galaxies .",
    "the jets end in strong shocks which accelerate electrons to relativistic velocities and may increase the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "the magnetized plasma passing through the jet shock subsequently inflates the lobe or cocoon .",
    "the basic dynamical picture was first proposed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite and ka97 showed that if the jet is in pressure - equilibrium with its own lobe , then the expansion of the lobe and the bow shock in front of it is self - similar .",
    "here we use the model of ka97 to describe the dynamics of the lobes .",
    "we summarize the most important features of this model below .",
    "the growth of the jet length is essentially determined by a balance of the ram pressures of the jet material and that of the medium surrounding the host galaxy which is pushed aside by the jet .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot gas in the vicinity of elliptical galaxies , in galaxy groups and in galaxy clusters find density distributions well fitted by @xmath60-models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in ka97",
    "the density distribution outside the core radius @xmath61 is approximated by a power - law : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the radial distance from the agn at the centre of the density distribution and @xmath64 is the density at the core radius .",
    "the exponent @xmath60 is constrained by observations to the range @xmath65 .",
    "we assume that the gas in the vicinity of the agn has a non - relativistic equation of state , @xmath66 , while the lobes only contain magnetic fields and relativistic particles , @xmath67 . for a jet providing a constant power @xmath68 for a time @xmath69 and inflating a lobe with an aspect ratio @xmath70",
    "we then find the lobe length , @xmath6 , and the pressure inside the lobe , @xmath71 , @xmath72 where @xmath73 note here that the model of the source dynamics only depends on the combination @xmath74 , but not on @xmath64 and @xmath61 separately .",
    "for convenience we therefore introduce the parameter @xmath75 . in our model",
    "we initially assume @xmath76 as this considerably simplifies the model equations .",
    "we will discuss the model with @xmath77 later .",
    "kda97 extended the dynamics model of ka97 to include the calculation of the radio emission expected from the lobe .",
    "the model takes into account the energy losses of the relativistic electrons due to the adiabatic expansion of the lobe , synchrotron radiation and inverse compton losses from scattering of the cosmic background radiation .",
    "these losses modify the energy distribution of the relativistic electrons which we assume to initially follow a power - law with exponent @xmath78 between a low and high energy cut - off represented by the lorentz factors of the least and most energetic electrons , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively . to simplify the equations and the model we choose @xmath81 for all sources .",
    "we also set @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "note that the exact value of the power - law limits does not significantly influence the model results as long as @xmath84 .",
    "a summary of all relevant model equations can be found in kb07 .",
    "our choice of @xmath78 limits the range of spectral indices predicted by the model to the narrow range from @xmath85 to @xmath86 . for young sources ,",
    "synchrotron energy losses are most important , while for old objects inverse compton losses dominate and both processes lead to a steep spectrum . for ` middle - age ' sources between these extremes ,",
    "the relativistic electrons are not much affected by radiative energy losses and so the spectrum flattens ( kb07 ) . in objects with observed spectral indices not conforming to this pattern a different acceleration regime",
    "may be applicable and lead to a different value of @xmath78 .",
    "our choice of a fixed value for @xmath78 implies that we can not expect the spectral index distribution of our artificial source populations to agree with that of the observed complete samples .",
    "however , the introduction of an unknown distribution for @xmath78 into the model would considerably complicate the analysis of our results and introduce another model parameter .",
    "the combined model of ka97 and kda in the form specified here depends on five model parameters , @xmath7 , @xmath70 , @xmath87 , @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "a complete set of these parameters fully determines the linear size of the lobes , @xmath6 , and their radio luminosity , @xmath5 .",
    "therefore we can take the observed distribution of sources in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 space to constrain the underlying distribution of the density of their environments described as @xmath87 , their age @xmath69 and their jet power @xmath68 . in the following",
    "we explain the practical implementation of this process as well as our assumption for the distribution of lobe aspect ratios , @xmath70 .",
    "the rlf , @xmath88 , gives the comoving number density of radio sources at a cosmological redshift @xmath7 with a given radio luminosity @xmath5 . the number of sources within the ranges @xmath7 to @xmath89 and @xmath90 to @xmath91 is given by @xmath92 , where @xmath93 is the comoving volume sampled between @xmath7 and @xmath89 .",
    "the relevant formulae are presented in section 2 .",
    "we consider redshifts from @xmath94 to @xmath95 with a step size of @xmath96 and radio luminosities at an observing frequency of 151mhz from @xmath97 to @xmath98 in steps of @xmath99 .",
    "these ranges cover the entire source population in all three observed samples we consider .",
    "we only calculate @xmath100 for combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath7 for which the corresponding observable flux exceeds the flux limit of the observed complete sample we use to compare our artificial sample with .    after calculating @xmath100 at all positions defined by our ranges and step sizes ,",
    "we normalize @xmath100 such that its maximum is equal to unity .",
    "we can now interpret @xmath101 as the distribution of the probability to find a source in an artificial sample with a given combination of redshift and radio luminosity . to construct our artificial sample",
    "we then iterate through all allowed combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath7 and generate a random number , @xmath102 , uniformly distributed between 0 and 1 . if @xmath103 for the chosen @xmath5 and @xmath7 , then a source with this radio luminosity and redshift is included in the artificial sample .",
    "we can increase the sample size by repeating the same process a fixed number of times at all allowed combinations of @xmath5 and @xmath7 .    once a source with a given combination of radio luminosity and redshift",
    "is included in the artificial sample , we need to calculate the linear size of its lobe to determine its position in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube for comparison with the observations . for this",
    ", we need the aspect ratio of the lobe , @xmath70 , the age of the source , @xmath69 , and the parameter describing the external density distribution , @xmath87 . fixing the values of these three parameters",
    "uniquely determines the length of the lobes , @xmath6 , and the jet power , @xmath68 . in other words ,",
    "fixing the values of three parameters uniquely determines the values of the remaining two . for each source in the artificial sample",
    "we will choose random values for @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath87 from distributions of these parameters discussed in the following in order to assign values to their linear sizes and jet power .",
    "it is difficult to accurately determine the aspect ratio of the lobe of a radio source .",
    "the lobe should ideally be detected all the way back to the central agn which suggests the use of a low observing frequency to minimize the effects of radiative energy losses . at the same time",
    "we need sufficient angular resolution to resolve the lobe perpendicular to the jet axis .",
    "this is best achieved at high observing frequencies . in practice",
    "a balance must be found between these requirements and so an observationally determined distribution of @xmath70 is not available in the literature . for simplicity we choose a uniform distribution across the range @xmath104 , where the limits are motivated by observed values ( leahy & williams , 1984 ) .",
    "below we discuss the minor effects on our results of changing this distribution .",
    "if we assume that all radio sources have a common maximum lifetime @xmath105 , then the distribution of their ages is given by a uniform distribution extending from @xmath106 to @xmath107 .",
    "spectral ages of some objects reach a few @xmath108years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but recently @xcite found an average age of around @xmath109years for a sample of frii - type objects located in low redshift galaxy groups , suggesting a maximum lifetime of a few @xmath109years .",
    "the maximum lifetime depends on the availability of fuel for the jet - producing agn and it would therefore be surprising , if @xmath105 was the same for all sources . however , the spread around the average age found by @xcite is comparatively small and for simplicity we assume that @xmath105 is indeed the same for all sources at a given redshift .",
    "we will show below that @xmath105 defined in this way may be a function of redshift .",
    "the parameter @xmath87 describing the density distribution in the environment of a source can , in principle , be determined from x - ray observations .",
    "frii - type objects seem to be preferentially located in isolated galaxies or galaxy groups . with @xmath76 , we expect @xmath87 between @xmath110kgm@xmath3 and @xmath111kgm@xmath3 for individual galaxies @xcite .",
    "for group environments @xcite find values for @xmath87 in the range @xmath112kgm@xmath3 and @xmath113kgm@xmath3 .",
    "note that all these determinations predict somewhat high values for @xmath87 , because we are using @xmath114 at the moment .",
    "for @xmath77 the values of @xmath87 are more consistent with the values given by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gas haloes of many galaxies and galaxy groups show flatter slopes implying smaller values of @xmath87 . again there is no determination of the complete distribution of @xmath87 for the environments of radio sources available in the literature .",
    "hence we draw random values for @xmath87 from a uniform distribution extending from @xmath115 to @xmath116 , where the maximum value is to be determined from the models and may be a function of redshift ( see below ) .    for every allowed combination of the radio luminosity and the redshift plus",
    "the randomly chosen values for @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath87 we can now proceed to calculate a linear size @xmath6 of the lobe and jet power @xmath68 for each source to be included in the artificial sample . the parameter distributions used here allow for a wide range of possible values for @xmath68 .",
    "not all values for @xmath68 are acceptable .",
    "sources with weak jets , i.e. small jet powers , will develop turbulent , rather than laminar jets and this will result in fri - type lobes .",
    "@xcite suggest that the transition between the fr types occurs close to @xmath117w based on radio observations of lobes and optical line emission from the agn itself .",
    "a similar lower limit for the jet power of sources with an frii - type morphology was derived by kb07 using the model we employ here as well .",
    "an upper limit on @xmath68 may be given by the eddington luminosity of the most massive black holes . in our model",
    "we require that @xmath118 .",
    "model parameters that imply a jet power outside this range are rejected . for rejected sources we generate new sets of model parameters , @xmath70 , @xmath69 and @xmath87 , in the way described above until an acceptable value for @xmath68",
    "is found .",
    "note here that the mathematical form of the distributions for the model parameters only indirectly influences the distributions of these parameters in the final artificial sample .",
    "combinations of model parameters must lead to acceptable results in the sense that not only must the resulting source have the correct radio luminosity and redshift , its jet power must also fall within the specified range .",
    "the resulting parameter distributions will in general not follow the distributions they are originally drawn from , because many possible parameter combinations will be rejected as described above .",
    "in large enough artificial samples the choice of uniform distributions over other mathematical functions therefore only weakly influences the final distributions of the model parameters .",
    "once an acceptable combination of model parameters is found , we can calculate the corresponding length of the lobes , @xmath6 .",
    "this is the physical length of the lobe and in order to compare to the observed complete samples we need to take into account that the lobes may be projected as their main axis is oriented at an angle @xmath119 to our line of sight .",
    "the observed lobe length is therefore given as @xmath120 , where the random orientation @xmath119 is distributed as @xmath121 between @xmath122 and @xmath123 . before including a source in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube of our artificial sample , we choose a random orientation angle and ` project ' the lobes into the sky plane .",
    "for simplicity , hereafter we denote the @xmath124 as just @xmath6 .",
    "the process of generating our artificial samples described above is summarized in the flow diagram in figure [ flow ] .",
    "our artificial samples contain of order 6000 sources .",
    "this is a much larger number than is contained in the observed samples .",
    "however , we found that such a large number is required to arrive at reasonably smooth source distributions in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cubes and also to minimize the influence of the initial model parameter distributions on the final distributions .",
    "our artificial samples define a source distribution within the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube equivalent to the observed samples .",
    "we use the three - dimensional version of the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to compare our model results with the observations .",
    "the classical one - dimensional kolmogorov - smirnov test makes use of the probability distribution of the quantity @xmath125 , defined as the largest absolute difference between the one - dimensional cumulative distributions of two samples , where one or both samples can be continuous or discrete .",
    "@xcite extends this idea to a two - dimensional test by making use of the maximum absolute difference between two distributions , when all four possible ways to cumulate data following the directions of the coordinate axes are considered . for the comparison of a sample with @xmath100 members with a continuous distribution peacock s",
    "test requires that the cumulative distributions should be calculated in all @xmath126 quadrants of the plane defined by , @xmath127 for all possible combinations of the indexes @xmath128 and @xmath129 from @xmath130 to @xmath100 . here ,",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 denote the coordinates of individual members of the discrete sample .",
    "@xcite show that it is sufficient to consider only the four quadrants defined by each individual data point in the discrete sample , i.e. @xmath133 .",
    "this reduces the total number of quadrants in which the distributions are accumulated to @xmath134 .",
    "furthermore , the extension of this methodology to three dimensions is straightforward , provided all eight quadrants defined by each individual data point are considered in deriving the largest difference , @xmath125 , of the cumulative distributions .    using the three - dimensional ks test we can now compare the fit of various artificial source distributions within the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube arising from different models with that of the observed samples .",
    "however , the method does not assign a formal goodness - of - fit measure because the statistics of @xmath125 in the three - dimensional ks test is in general not known .",
    "also , the selection criteria for the observed samples , in particular their flux limit , prevent the population of certain parts of the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 cube . to assess which model provides an acceptable fit to the observations",
    ", we separately construct the statistics of @xmath125 for each model calculation .",
    "for this we generate a large number of sources for a specific model as detailed above .",
    "we then repeatedly draw random subsamples from these model sources with a total source number equal to that of the observed comparison sample .",
    "we calculate the total difference @xmath125 of the cumulative distributions of the subsample and the parent model sample . in this way we build up the probability distribution of @xmath125 for this particular model . based on this statistic",
    "we assign a probability @xmath135 to the value @xmath125 calculated for the observed sample .",
    "@xmath135 is then the probability that the observed sample arises as a subsample drawn randomly from all radio sources in the universe , if that population is described by the model .",
    "while this technique may guide us in the selection of models , it clearly can not identify the statistically most likely model because the distribution of @xmath125 will be different for each individual model .",
    "we now have all the ingredients to generate our artificial samples and compare them to the observed samples . in doing so",
    "our general approach is to start with the simplest models and only modify these as necessary to achieve a better agreement with the observations .",
    "it is not feasible to show the full three - dimensional source distributions used in the comparisons . in order to present our results",
    ", we therefore plot two - dimensional projections of the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 cube .",
    "sources in observed samples are presented as individual crosses while the large numbers of sources in the artificial samples are shown as density contours in these plots .",
    "the contours enclose areas of 1% , 10% , 40% and 80% of the maximum density in each plot .",
    "note that in the following we always show the radio luminosity density of sources in the 3crr sample and associated artificial samples at 178mhz rather than 151mhz .",
    "while we use the rlf at 151mhz in our models to calculate relative source numbers as detailed above , we calculate the luminosity for our artificial sources at 178mhz and use the appropriate flux limit for this frequency when comparing with the 3crr sample .      the simplest model we can build within the framework described above has uniform distributions with fixed upper limits for the source age and the density parameter .",
    "we assume a fixed @xmath136 years and investigate a range of possible @xmath137 .",
    "none of the @xmath137 tried leads to a probability significantly different from zero as measured by the ks test . varying @xmath105 instead of @xmath138 leads to the same result .    as an example , in figure [ modela ] we show a comparison of the resulting artificial samples with @xmath139kgm@xmath3 with the observed samples .",
    "clearly high luminosity sources located at high redshifts are too large in our artificial samples compared to the observed sources .",
    "the sources in the artificial samples show a trend of increasing size with increasing luminosity until the trend is reversed at the highest luminosities .",
    "the radio luminosity of a source in the kda model is mainly governed by the jet power , @xmath140 .",
    "however , a larger value of @xmath140 also implies faster growth of the lobes and , all other parameters being equal on average , it is not surprising that we find a trend of radio luminosity with size in our artificial sample .",
    "the reversal of this trend at the highest luminosities has been noted by many authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for observed samples . in the artificial samples it is caused by the flux limits of the samples in combination with the decreasing luminosity of older , and therefore larger , sources",
    "clearly the evolutionary model used here predicts that this effect alone is not sufficient to explain the observed trend reversal and some other effects must contribute to reconcile the model with the observations ( see also ka99 ) .",
    "we will investigate such effects in the next two sections .",
    "modified models with a steeper luminosity evolution of individual sources do not need to invoke such additional effects ( brw and mk ) .",
    "however , they may be less consistent with the overall source distribution ( bw06 ) .",
    "we shall apply these models in the same way to the data as the combined models of ka97 and kda in section 9 .      in this and the following sections we investigate which additional factors",
    "may lead to a better fit of the predicted distribution of sources in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 cube with the observational data .",
    "we have shown above that in our modeling framework we need an additional effect to explain the apparent shortening of the lobes of sources with the highest radio luminosities located at the highest redshifts . in this section",
    "we introduce a redshift dependence for the upper limit of the density parameter @xmath87 . in the following section",
    "we do the same for the upper limit of the source age distribution .",
    "we fix the maximum source age to @xmath141years and introduce a variable upper limit for the distribution of @xmath87 such that @xmath142 . the best agreement between artificial and observed samples",
    "is achieved for 3crr with @xmath143kgm@xmath3 and @xmath144 , giving a probability that the observed sample is drawn from a population described by the model of @xmath145 .",
    "the values for 6ce are @xmath146kgm@xmath3 , @xmath147 and @xmath148 .",
    "the limits on the model parameters give their value where @xmath135 halves compared to its maximum .",
    "the fit of the model to the 7crs sample is much worse and the values for @xmath135 are very low .",
    "this is related to problems with the used rlf for this sample .",
    "we discuss this issue in section 8.4.2 . in any case",
    ", the maximum of @xmath135 for 7crs occurs close to @xmath149kgm@xmath3 and @xmath150 , consistent with the results for the other two samples . a model with @xmath151kgm@xmath3 and @xmath152 provides an acceptable fit to both 3crr ( @xmath153 ) and 6ce ( @xmath154 ) .",
    "the comparison of this model and the observed samples is shown in figure [ modelb ] .",
    "the much better fit of model b compared to model a is explained by the considerably higher average density of the source environments at high redshifts .",
    "the density parameter @xmath87 has only a moderate influence on the radio luminosity of a model source compared to the jet power .",
    "however , a high value of @xmath87 efficiently reduces the expansion speed of the lobes .",
    "hence the strong evolution of @xmath138 with @xmath7 in model b ensures that sources at high redshift remain smaller for longer than their low redshift counterparts .",
    "this allows a better fit of the high luminosity / high redshift part of the source population .                  instead of invoking denser average source environments at higher redshifts to reduce the average size of the highest luminosity sources , we can also reduce the average source lifetime for increasing redshift . for this",
    "we fix @xmath155 at @xmath156kgm@xmath3 for all @xmath7 and introduce a variable maximum age as @xmath157 . the best agreement is found for @xmath158yr and @xmath159 for 3crr with @xmath160 .",
    "the 6ce sample gives an almost identical result with @xmath161yr and @xmath162 where @xmath163 .",
    "again , the comparison with 7crs does not produce good fits for the reasons we will discuss in section 8.4.2 , but the maximum of the probability occurs close to the parameter values for the two other samples .",
    "the maximum source age at low redshifts is reassuringly close to the value of the average source lifetime of @xmath164yr recently derived by @xcite for an independent sample .",
    "figure [ modelc ] compares the model results with the observed data .",
    "we assume a uniform distribution of @xmath87 in model c. the real distribution of @xmath87 is unknown and it does not have to be uniform . instead of an uniform distribution",
    ", we also introduce a gaussian distribution with its peak at @xmath165kgm@xmath3 and a width of @xmath166kgm@xmath3 .",
    "the distribution is truncated so that there are no values of @xmath87 below 0 or above @xmath167kgm@xmath3 .",
    "this distribution covers the same range of @xmath87 , but is of course different from an uniform distribution .",
    "the agreement with the same @xmath168 and @xmath169 are @xmath170 for 3crr and @xmath171 for 6ce . for the extreme assumption of a fixed value of @xmath172kgm@xmath3 for all sources",
    ", we can still find a comparable agreement with @xmath173 for 3crr and @xmath174 for 6ce .",
    "clearly , we can not rule out these distributions compared to an uniform distribution .",
    "we will discuss this point in detail in section 10 .",
    "both models b and c can provide adequate fits to the observed samples 3crr and 6ce .",
    "given the results detailed above , we can not formally decide whether it is a reduced maximum lifetime or a denser environment that limits the lobe sizes of sources with the greatest radio luminosities at the highest redshifts accessible to the observed samples .",
    "of course , a combination of the two effects is also not ruled out .",
    "however , the result shows that with currently available samples it is not necessary to introduce yet more complicated models to explain the distribution of sources in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube .",
    "we will concentrate on model c in the discussion of parameter dependencies , alternative models and the further implications of our results .",
    "this does not indicate that we prefer model c over model b , but is simply done to avoid confusion .",
    "@xmath60 is the power - law exponent which indicates how fast the environment density decreases away from the center agn . in previous sections , we use @xmath76 , but most studies of the environments of low redshift radio galaxies in x - ray band imply that @xmath60 could be closer to 1.5 than 2 .",
    "here we apply @xmath77 in the kda model to check how much it will affect our results .    with a smaller value of @xmath60 , the density of the environment decreases more slowly and the speed of growth of the lobe is slower . in this case ,",
    "it is not surprising to have a higher maximum jet age .",
    "the best fitting parameters we find are @xmath175yr , @xmath176 for fixed @xmath177kgm@xmath178 .",
    "the godness of fit decreases slightly to @xmath179 for 3crr and @xmath154 for 6ce .",
    "the agreement is still good while the value of @xmath168 is still consistent with the range discussed in section 6 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath60 does not significantly change our simulation results and conclusions .",
    "we will still concentrate on the models with @xmath76 in the following sections .",
    "in our construction of the artificial samples we have used a fixed uniform distribution for the aspect ratio of the lobes @xmath70 .",
    "since @xmath70 affects both the size and the radio luminosity of the lobes , it is reasonable to ask how much our results depend on our assumptions for @xmath70 .",
    "if we replace the uniform distribution of @xmath70 over the range 1.3 to 6 we used so far with a constant @xmath70 for all model sources , then the distribution of lobe sizes within our artificial samples becomes slightly narrower .",
    "the average size also shifts somewhat depending on the value assumed for @xmath70 .",
    "this effect is illustrated in figure [ rtmodel ] .",
    "there is no noticeable restriction of the luminosity range . for model c with the best fitting parameters , but a constant value for @xmath70 , we find that the probability @xmath135 decreases to 34% for 3crr ( @xmath181 ) and remains constant at 59% for 6ce ( @xmath182 ) . we conclude that changing the range or distribution of @xmath70 will only have a minor effect on our results .",
    "this is particularly encouraging because the alternative evolutionary models for individual sources we introduce below assume fixed values for @xmath70 .",
    "the adoption of an rlf allows us to include the low - luminosity frii sources in the artificial sample , and is a more direct method to constrain the source distribution than the introduction of a birth function .",
    "however , in general a rlf requires more parameters than a simple birth function. the changes in these parameters may also change the simulation results .",
    "here we use the generalized luminosity function(glf ) constructed by @xcite for comparision with the rlf of w01 used so far .",
    "@xcite consider both radio luminosity and optical luminosity of the agn and introduce a parameter @xmath183 encoding the @xmath184 correlation and a parameter @xmath185 encoding scatter about this correlation .",
    "the glf based on @xmath183 and @xmath185 can generate a smoother rlf than the rlf of w01 .",
    "however the total source counts predicted by the glf do not change very much compared to the rlf of w01 as @xcite show in their figure 11 .",
    "if we substitute the glf into model c with the same best fitting parameters and a modified frii fraction of 50% in the low-@xmath183 population , we can still find a reasonable agreement with @xmath186 for 3crr and @xmath187 for 6ce .",
    "the use of an rlf introduces many parameters , and the changes in these parameters do affect the fitting result .",
    "however within a reasonable range , we can still get good agreement between artificial and observed samples with a modified rlf .",
    "meanwhile , the conclusion that the frii properties evolve with redshift do not change with the choice of rlf .",
    "the frii fraction in the low - luminosity population is another parameter introduced in the rlf that can affect the fitting result .",
    "the value of @xmath188 comes from the simulation .",
    "if we apply a smaller fraction , for example @xmath189 , we will find too few low - luminosity sources .",
    "the agreement for 3crr and 6ce drops below @xmath190 .",
    "therefore , although some fainter surveys at low frequency such as the bologna surveys indicate the frii fraction at the low luminosities could be smaller , we still need to choose @xmath188 as the appropriate value for our work for fitting the 3crr , 6ce and 7crs samples .",
    "in all our models discussed above we noted that our approach can not provide an adequate fit to the source distribution of the 7crs sample .",
    "the main problem appears to be the different relative number of sources at low redshifts and high redshifts in the various samples .",
    "this may be due to a changing mix of sources with different fr morphology below the break in the rlf .",
    "so far we have assumed that a constant fraction of 40% of the sources contributing to the low luminosity part of the rlf of w01 are of type frii , irrespective of redshift",
    ". a closer look at the three observed samples reveals that this assumption may be too simplistic .    within a range from @xmath191whz@xmath3sr@xmath3 to @xmath192whz@xmath3sr@xmath3 at 151mhz",
    "the 3crr sample contains 20 sources in a redshift range @xmath193 of which 12 show an frii - type morphology . in the same luminosity range ,",
    "7crs contains a total of 33 sources spanning a redshift range from @xmath194 to @xmath195 of which 26 are of type frii .",
    "these numbers suggest an increased fraction of frii - type sources within the low luminosity population at higher redshifts .",
    "the 6ce sample does not fit into this trend with 3 frii - type sources out of a total of 7 within the luminosity range and at redshifts intermediate between 3crr and 7crs .",
    "however , the number of sources in this sample is very small .",
    "based on these numbers we test whether a redshift dependence of the fr mix helps to improve the model fit to the 7crs data .",
    "we set the frii fraction within the low luminosity population of the rlf of w01 equal to @xmath196 up to @xmath197 and keep it at unity at higher redshifts . with the modification of the rlf",
    "the agreement of model c with the 7crs data increases , but not significantly . the value of @xmath135 increases for 3crr to 84% , while it decreases for 6ce to 47% .",
    "a comparison of the model with the observational data is shown in figure [ rlf1 ] .",
    "changing the fr mix in the low luminosity part of the rlf does not have the desired effect of improving the fit with the 7crs data .",
    "however , the presently available data do not allow us to decide whether a change with redshift in the composition of the radio source population is taking place or not .    from figure [ rlf1 ]",
    "we see that there are too many sources in our artificial sample around @xmath4 and @xmath198whz@xmath3sr@xmath3 compared to the 7crs sample .",
    "in fact , this problem , that the rlf of w01 overpredicts the number of sources with this radio luminosity at this redshift compared to 7crs , is discussed by w01 ( see their figures 7 and 8) .",
    "the 7crs data is consistent with no further evolution of the high luminosity part of the rlf beyond redshift @xmath199 .",
    "implementing such a constant rlf at redshifts beyond @xmath199 in our model dramatically improves the agreement between our model c and the 7crs data to @xmath200 .",
    "however , this rlf reduces the agreement between model c and the 3crr sample to @xmath201 while @xmath135 for the 6ce sample drops below 0.1% .",
    "therefore it is unlikely that this modification of the rlf is necessary .",
    "the 7crs sample covers a very small sky area compared to the 3crr and 6ce samples .",
    "this may imply that the members of this sample are not fully representative of the entire source population .",
    "comparisons of the artificial samples arising from this modification of the rlf with the observations are shown in figure [ rlf2 ] .",
    "w and @xmath202 , the centre curves are for @xmath203w and @xmath204 , and the lower curves are for @xmath205w and @xmath206 .",
    "each of the solid , dashed and dotted curves refer to the tracks given by kda , mk and brw models respectively .",
    "the pluses on the curves are time markers denoting source lifetimes of 1,10,20, ... 90myr.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    the brl sample , as discussed in section 3 , is roughly equivalent to 3crr with a similar flux limit and source number .",
    "thus the brl sample and the 3crr sample can be considered as two samples drawn from the same universe with similar selection criteria , but from different areas of the sky .",
    "the comparison between these two samples indicates the agreement between two samples drawn from the same parent population and can therefore give us some idea of how well our models agree with the observations .",
    "the brl sample is observed at 408mhz , so we use a constant spectral index of @xmath207 to convert the radio luminosity of brl sources to 178mhz .",
    "we ignore the sources whose luminosity is below the flux limit given by 3crr .",
    "comparing the 3crr sample and the brl sample in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube , we get @xmath208 from the 3-d ks test .",
    "if we choose an artificial brl sample with the same source number as the real brl sample from the best - fitting artificial 3crr sample and compare with the real 3crr sample , @xmath209 is mostly between @xmath210 to @xmath211 .",
    "as the smaller values of @xmath209 indicate a better fit , this shows that our best - fitting artificial sample agrees with the observations to a degree similar to the agreement between similar observed samples drawn from the same source population .",
    "figure [ e_3 ] shows the 3crr sample and the brl sample in the @xmath5-@xmath6-@xmath7 data cube .",
    "before discussing our results in more detail , we now assess how much they depend on our particular choice for the model of the evolution of individual sources .",
    "the model describing the dynamics and expansion of the radio lobe , ka97 , essentially relies on the condition of ram pressure balance between the jet material and the receding ambient gas in front of it .",
    "this condition was first introduced by @xcite and has formed the basis for virtually all subsequent models of the dynamical evolution of radio sources with an frii - type morphology ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "while the details of the derivation of the lobe dynamics differ , the basic principle is the same .",
    "as we do not consider in detail the evolution of individual objects , we therefore do not use another dynamical source model .",
    "based on the dynamical model of ka97 , two alternative descriptions for the emission properties of the lobes have been formulated by brw and mk . the main difference between these models and kda is the treatment of the radiating electrons as they propagate from the ends of the jets , or hotspots , into the lobes .",
    "the kda model assumes that the energy distribution of the electrons is described by a power - law and that they only suffer adiabatic losses during the transition from the hotspot into the lobe .",
    "brw considers the effect of synchrotron energy losses within the hotspot by introducing a doubly broken power - law for the energy distribution .",
    "mk describe in detail the diffusion of the electrons from the hotspot into the lobe taking into account radiative energy losses and possible re - acceleration .",
    "figure [ track ] shows a comparison of the luminosity evolution of a single radio source as described by the three models . the luminosity evolution is steeper for the two alternative models with the brw model the steepest . in the following",
    "we will describe both models in more detail and then substitute them for the kda model in our formalism .",
    "bw06 and bw07 use the same models in their comparisons .    when comparing the results arising from the use of the three different evolutionary models , we employ model c with @xmath212kgm@xmath3 , consistent with the original formulation of brw and mk .",
    "however , to allow a direct comparison with our previous results we set @xmath114 , @xmath213 and @xmath214 . also note that the two models in their original form require a fixed value for @xmath70 . as shown in section 8.4.1",
    ", this should not lead to major changes of the results .",
    "finally , we also want to compare the model predictions with the 7crs data . in order to do",
    "so we use the modified rlf as described in section 8.4.2 . for the 3crr and 6ce samples we continue to use the unmodified rlf .",
    "the brw model takes the lobe dynamics from the ka97 model .",
    "this sets the pressure in the lobe , @xmath71 , according to equation ( [ pressure ] ) . as in kda ,",
    "the pressure in the hotspot in front of the end of the jet is higher than @xmath71 by a constant factor . with the assumption of energy equipartition in the hotspot ,",
    "the hotspot pressure fixes the strength of the magnetic field and the normalization of the energy distribution of the electrons at a given point in time .",
    "brw assume further that the hotspot has a fixed physical size and that it takes electrons between 1yr and @xmath215yr to escape from the hotspot into the lobe , independent of any other model parameter .",
    "these timescales give rise to two breaks in the electron energy spectrum .",
    "their positions are calculated using the standard equipartition formulae . below the low energy break",

    "the radiating electrons are accelerated to an initial power - law energy distribution within the hotspot .",
    "in contrast to the brw model , mk exactly follow the subsequent evolution of the energy distribution under the influence of adiabatic and radiative energy losses as the electrons diffuse through the hotspot into the lobe .",

    "the fitting result for 7crs is not as good as that for the kda model , because the evolutionary tracks of the mk model are steeper and predict more sources with small linear size at the high redshift / high luminosity end .    for the 3crr and 6ce samples ,",

    "<S> by combining a model for the evolution of the radio luminosity of an individual source with the radio luminosity function , we perform a multi - dimensional monte - carlo simulation to investigate the cosmological evolution of the fanaroff - riley class ii radio galaxy population by generating large artificial samples . </S>",
    "<S> the properties of frii sources are required to evolve with redshift in the artificial samples to fit the observations . either the maximum jet age or the maximum density of the jet environment or both evolve with redshift . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the distribution of frii source properties as a function of redshift . from currently available data </S>",
    "<S> we can not constrain the shape of the distribution of environment density or age , but jet power is found to follow a power - law distribution with an exponent of approximately -2 . this power - law slope does not change with redshift out to @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the distribution of the pressure in the lobes of frii sources to evolve with redshift up to @xmath1 .    </S>",
