    "quasi - two - dimensional dichalcogenides tx@xmath0 ( t = nb , ta , mo , hf ; x = s , se ) and their different polymorhic modifications long time ago attracted the attention of scientific community @xcite . this was connected with : ( i ) early suggestions to look for high - t@xmath1 superconductivity in layered compounds ; ( ii ) the discovery of phase transitions with formation of charge density waves ( cdw ) @xcite . in particular , in 2h - tase@xmath0 ( 2h means  hexagonal structure with two ta layers in the unitcell ) the second order transition into incommensurate cdw phase is observed at temperature =122.3k . at 90k",
    "there is another transition to commensurate cdw phase @xcite . in 2h - nbse@xmath0",
    "transition to incommensurate cdw phase happens at much lower temperature of 33.5k @xcite and no commensurate cdw phase is observed .",
    "above the temperature of incommensurate cdw transition in these systems there might be the range of temperatures where short - range order cdw fluctuations with finite , but pretty large , correlation length @xmath2 may exist due to low - dimensional nature of these systems ( and in analogy with antiferromagnetic fluctuations in cuprates ) .",
    "this indeed is experimentally observed in angular resolved x - ray photoemission ( arpes ) experiments @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present band structure calculation results for 2h - tase@xmath0 and 2h - nbse@xmath0 with analysis of possible topologies of the fermi surfaces upon doping , showing possibility of formation of `` bone''- like fermi sheets .",
    "further we describe the details of theoretical description of multiband electronic multiple scattering on cdw in a multiple band systems , as applied to pseudogap , incommensurate and commensurate cdw phases for both 2h - tase@xmath0 and 2h - nbse@xmath0 . as an outcome",
    ", we obtain spectral functions and fermi surface maps , which are compared with a number of recent arpes results @xcite .",
    "the 2h - tx@xmath0 layered compounds have hexagonal crystal structure with the space group of symmetry p6@xmath3/mmc with lattice parameters for ta system a=3.436    and c=12.7   .",

    "was employed .",
    "obtained band structure and fermi surfaces are in good agreement with similar lda calculations by other authors @xcite .",
    "we do not present any lda results on 2h - nbse@xmath0 since its crystal structure @xcite and corresponding band structure are very close to those of 2h - tase@xmath0 .    in accord with the previous works @xcite in our lda calculations the fermi level in 2h - tase@xmath0",
    "is crossed by two ta-5d bands with @xmath7 symmetry ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1]a ) , which are well separated from other bands .",

    "our results are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b . here",
    "we observe three hole - like cylinders around the @xmath8-point .    during the recent years several arpes studies detected the experimental fs of 2h - tase@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite the electronic structure of the valence band was studied in 1t - tas@xmath0 and 2h - tase@xmath0 . for 2h - tase@xmath0",
    "it was shown that along @xmath8-k direction there are four crossings with the fs .",
    "similar picture is also seen in lda results ( fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , b ) . in later arpes works",
    "@xcite it was observed that fs of 2h - tase@xmath0 has more complex topology .",
    "namely , along @xmath8-k direction there appear the `` bone''-like fs sheets . within the lda picture one can obtain such `` bones '' by the shift of the fermi level down by about 0.1 ev ( fig .",

    "consider the schematic picture of the first brillouin zone for two - dimensional hexagonal lattice , shown in fig . [ qx ] . in hexagonal structures under study ,",
    "the commensurate cdw vector is @xmath16 that corresponds to tripling the lattice period . scattering an electron by this commensurate cdw vector returns electron back to equivalent point after triple scattering : @xmath17 .",
    "moreover for hexagonal structures there are in fact six equivalent scattering vectors : @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 @xmath22 .",

    "thus for one band case to find the diagonal green s function of an electron @xmath36 and twelve off - diagonal ( @xmath37 and ( @xmath38 ) single - electron green s functions we have to solve the system of thirteen linear equations ( [ system ] ) ( see appendix ) .",
    "such an approach can be generalized for a multiple band case with simplifying assumption @xcite that intra- and interband cdw scattering amplitudes are just the same ( see appendix ) solving these equations we can finally find the diagonal green function @xmath39 ( @xmath40  band indices ) and corresponding spectral function : @xmath41 determining the effective electron dispersion .

    "similar to the commensurate case discussed above , this vector corresponds to six independent scattering vectors @xmath45 @xmath46 .",
    "let us consider single scattering of an electron with momenta @xmath29 near the fs by vector @xmath23(@xmath45 ) . for general values of @xmath29 ,",

    "further we will work in the so called two - wave approximation , when scattering act consists of two successive scattering processes by vectors @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

( [ gij ] ) again we obtain : @xmath54 which can provide us with the spectral function ( [ spden ] ) for the case of incommensurate cdw scattering .      above the temperature of incommensurate cdw transition there is no long - range charge ordering , but due to low - dimensionality of the system there are rather well developed short - range order cdw fluctuations , with finite correlation length @xmath2 and characteristic wave - vector @xmath55 which becomes rather quick commensurate with @xmath16 @xcite as temperature lowers . in analogy to incommensurate electronic cdw scattering we will employ two - wave approximation with pair of vectors ( @xmath45 ) .",

    "let us mention that the number of different diagrams is defined by product of number of ways to interconnect vertices of type 1 , 2 and 3 .",
    "since only outgoing and incoming lines of each type can be connected , combinatorics corresponds to incommensurate case @xcite .",

    "for each type of interaction lines ( 1,2,3 ) we will have its own incommensurate combinatorial prefactors , same as in refs .",

    "@xcite , devoted to description of possible pseudogap behavior in iron based superconductors , and assume that intra and interband pseudogap scattering amplitudes are identical .",

    "this green s function allows us to find the spectral function ( [ spden ] ) in the presence of cdw pseudogap fluctuations .",
    "in our calculations we used rather typical estimate of cdw potential @xmath860.05 ev , and for correlations length of pseudogap fluctuations we assumed the value of @xmath2=10@xmath87 ( where @xmath87 is the lattice spacing ) . to mimic for the experimental arpes resolution we broadened our spectral functions with lorentzian of width @xmath88 ,",

    "[ exp_band ]",
    ". however , here we see some _ additional _ broadening of initial spectra .",
    "these broadened regions of spectral functions with lower intensity represent regions pseudogap formation .",
    "why do we speak about regions ?",
    "in contrast to cuprates @xcite where we have finite and rather small number of `` hot - spots '' here we have almost infinite number of `` hot - spots '' and it is the interplay between all of them , which leads to the formation of such regions . but still dispersions here does not have any obvious discontinuities .",
    "middle panel of fig .",
    "[ sp_full ] displays the case of incommensurate cdw phase .",
    "now we see that regions previously covered with pseudogap have clear discontinuities  gaps and also many shadow bands .",

    "the cylinder around k - point is now continuous . in the middle of the `` bones '' we observe the start of formation of small triangles as shown in the center of middle panel .",
    "thus , here in commensurate cdw phase of 2h - tase@xmath0 we again obtain an overall agreement between theory and experiment .    in fig .",

    "both fermi surfaces remind those from fig .",
    "account of electron scattering on commensurate cdw leads to a small regions of fermi surface destruction , namely , along @xmath8-k and k - m directions .",
    "if there exists incommensurate pseudogap phase for 2h - nbse@xmath0 at high enough temperatures , its fermi surface will not be changed much by pseudogap fluctuations , as seen in the upper panel of fig .",

    "to conclude , here we presented theoretical results on electronic structure of two - dimensional diselenides 2h - tase@xmath0 and 2h - nbse@xmath0 within different cdw phases .",
    "first of all we formulated a theoretical approach to account for multiple scattering of electrons on different types of cdw , also for the multiple bands case .",
    "further we investigated spectral functions and fermi surfaces for the pseudogap , incommensurate cdw and commensurate cdw phases .",
    "calculated theoretical spectral functions within the pseudogap phase demonstrate `` hot regions '' , where spectral function is additionally broadened . in incommensurate cdw and commensurate cdw phases in a place of these `` hot regions '' we obtained opening of the number of gaps at the intersections with rather pronounced `` shadow bands '' .",
    "comparing experimental and theoretical fermi surfaces in the pseudogap phase we observe rather clear signs of partial fermi surface destruction with formation of a number of typical `` fermi arcs '' , separated by pseudogap regions . in commensurate cdw phase",
    "fermi surfaces are rather similar to initial lda picture , with pretty small features due to cdw .",
    "the overall agreement between theory and arpes experiments is rather satisfactory .",
    "we thank s.v . borisenko for his interest and helpful discussions . this work is partly supported by rfbr grant 11 - 02 - 00147 and",
