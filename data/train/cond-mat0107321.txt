    "quantum dots have been the subject of both experimental and theoretical research in recent years@xcite .",
    "they have been successfully created experimentally by applying lithographic and etching techniques to impose a lateral structure onto an otherwise two - dimensional electron system .",
    "these structures introduce electrostatic potentials in the plane of the two - dimensional electron gas , which confine the electrons to a dot region .",
    "the energy levels of electrons in such a quantum dot are fully quantized like in an atom , and therefore they are also referred to as _ artificial atoms_. for a theoretical description of such systems",
    "it is essential to know the confinement potential .",
    "often a parabolic potential is used .",
    "another simple model , which also has the advantage of representing a finite confinement , is a piecewise constant potential with a circular boundary@xcite .",
    "this type of potential represents more closely the situation in self - assembled quantum dots@xcite .",
    "the latter model is used , but extended to an asymmetric situation , i.e. an elliptic dot .",
    "there have been many calculations of energy levels in rectangular dots and wires , see for example @xcite , but in general , the problem of even one particle confined in such a potential profile is not exactly solvable , because the corresponding schrdinger equation is not separable .",
    "nevertheless one usually assumes separability , although this approximation is only acceptable for deep wells , where only a negligible part of the wave function is situated outside the dot . in our study",
    "we use an elliptically shaped potential profile for which exact solutions can be found , even when we take @xmath0 , or a potential @xmath1 outside the dot .",
    "we are especially interested in the results for elongated dots , which could then be compared with the case of a rectangular slab or even a quantum wire .",
    "our results are also applicable to elliptic quantum wires .    in the literature",
    "one can find many references to calculations on elliptic problems , we found one particularly useful@xcite , in which the diffraction of waves by ribbons and by slits is studied exactly .",
    "the problem of a three - dimensional ellipsoidal ( 3d ) quantum well has been solved exactly in refs . @xcite and @xcite for @xmath2 . to our knowledge , the corresponding 2d problem for finite potential barriers has not been solved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we obtain the analytical solution for the energy and the wave functions . the numerical results are presented in sec .",
    "our conclusions are given in sec .",
    "a representation  for the mathieu functions is listed in the appendix .",
    "a particle with mass @xmath3 is confined in a two - dimensional hard - wall potential well of finite height with elliptic shape as shown in fig .",

    "@xmath14 the equation to be solved becomes @xmath15 proposing a solution @xmath16 we find that the problem is separable in two equations in @xmath17 and @xmath18 , coupled by a separation constant @xmath19 and the variable @xmath20 .",
    "denoting @xmath21 we obtain ,    @xmath22    which are the characteristic equations for the mathieu functions .",
    "physical solutions to these equations are well - known@xcite    @xmath23    where @xmath24.the normalization factors are discarded and will be incorporated later in the total wave function @xmath25 .",
    "the mathieu functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 are respectively even and odd in @xmath18 and are the analogue of the cosine and sine functions in the angular solution of the circular dot problem . for the @xmath17-problem",
    "we make a distinction between solutions inside and outside the dot . the former show oscillatory behavior and are the analogue of the bessel functions @xmath28 in the radial solution of the circular problem .",
    "the latter are monotonically decaying functions and are the analogue of the modified bessel functions @xmath29 in the circular problem . in choosing these particular functions we used the boundary conditions that the wave functions need to be finite when @xmath30 and @xmath31 for obvious normalization reasons . outside the dot @xmath32 and",
    "the variable @xmath33 becomes negative , which we noted explicitly . in the appendix",
    "explicit expressions for the mathieu functions are given .",
    "the wave function @xmath25 and its derivatives must be continuous everywhere .",
    "this condition requires that at every point on the border @xmath34 of the quantum dot we have    @xmath35    where the @xmath17-independent functions @xmath36 cancel out .",
    "we introduce @xmath37 , which is related to the area of the ellipse and define @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the energy levels will be expressed in units of @xmath41 .",
    "clearly @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "we are therefore left with two equations for even and odd solutions in one variable @xmath44 to be solved numerically    @xmath45    solutions are indexed @xmath46 .",
    "the energy spectrum is then given by    @xmath47    in the limit of an infinitely high barrier , @xmath48 , the boundary condition will simply become @xmath49 , or equivalently ,    @xmath50    when the particle has a different effective mass inside ( @xmath51 ) and outside the dot ( @xmath52 ) the boundary condition eq .",
    "( [ boundarycondition ] ) has to be modified into    @xmath53    the explicit expressions for the wave functions are , for the even functions , @xmath54 and for the odd functions , @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are determined by normalization of the complete wave function .",
    "in fig . [ fig2 ] we show the dependence of the energy of the bound states on the strength of the well @xmath58 , which depends both on the potential height @xmath41 and on the area of the dot @xmath59 . for clarity",
    "we have limited all our graphs to @xmath60 .",
    "for @xmath61 the results coincide with our calculations for a circular dot . when the ratio @xmath62 increases , the degeneracy of the @xmath63 energy levels is lifted and they split in separate levels .",
    "this is a result of a decrease in symmetry of the system in the transition from a circular to an elliptic dot . with increasing @xmath62 ,  energy levels corresponding with even states lower , while those corresponding with uneven states rise in energy .",
    "this behavior is more clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we have plotted the energy levels against the ratio @xmath62 , with @xmath64 fixed . for small and narrow dots , only the even @xmath65 states remain , while the uneven states become unbound .",
    "the total number of states stays approximately equal . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] it is also clear that even the smallest and narrowest dot holds at least one confined state . the energy of this lowest state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as a function of the eccentricity @xmath62 .",
    "there is only a small increase of the energy level with increasing eccentricity .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for the energy of the ground state in a shallow 2d well can be obtained analytically .",
    "because of the weak dependence of this energy on the eccentricity we assume for simplicity @xmath66 .",
    "outside the well the wavefunction is then given by the modified bessel function , @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the binding energy in the well and @xmath69 .",
    "for small @xmath70 this wave function can to first order be approximated by @xmath71 with @xmath72 the constant of euler - mascheroni . inside the potential",
    "well the ground state wave function is almost constant . integrating this function over the schrdinger equation we obtain the binding energy @xmath73 with the prefactor @xmath74 . in figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] and [ fig3 ] the ground state energy for small @xmath64 can be approximated by @xmath75    the results for an infinitely high confinement potential are shown in fig .",
    "the behavior is comparable to the finite well case , except that all the energy levels will eventually rise with increasing eccentricity .",
    "notice that in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we find that for large eccentricity the energy levels appear in bands where the levels are practically equidistant .",
    "this can be understood from the following simple consideration . if @xmath76 we can use an adiabatic approximation and assume that the motion along the @xmath77-direction is much faster than along @xmath78 . for @xmath79",
    "the electron feels a hard wall potential along the @xmath80-direction of width @xmath81 which has energy levels @xmath82 .",
    "this results into a potential along the @xmath78-direction @xmath83 which near its minimum is parabolic .",
    "the resulting energy levels become @xmath84 , which for fixed @xmath85 results into an equidistant set of levels as found in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] for @xmath86 .",
    "the dependence on the eccentricity becomes more clear if we introduce @xmath37 , which was taken fixed in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , into the above expression , which leads to @xmath87 notice that the linear increase with @xmath62 results from the zero point motion along the @xmath80-direction .    to see the effect of different well ( @xmath51 ) and barrier ( @xmath52 ) masses we present in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] the results for the bound states in the case of three different mass ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "there is a decrease of the energy levels , i.e. increase of binding , when the effective mass of the electron outside the dot is higher than inside the dot .",
    "the @xmath90 levels become bound at the same value for @xmath64 , while this is no longer the case for @xmath91 .",
    "the density distribution of the wave functions corresponding to the different bound states , denoted by @xmath92 or @xmath93 , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "the even @xmath65 states form the lowest levels and they have all their extrema of the wave function located along a row in the direction of the longest axis of the ellipse . in this particular case ,",
    "a second row of extrema appears only at the sixth state @xmath96 , which is odd .",
    "when @xmath97 , we see three rows appear . in all cases",
    "the number of extrema in a row is determined by @xmath98 .",
    "the general pattern is that the lowest levels are those for which the position of the extrema of the wave function best fit the shape of the quantum dot .",
    "by expressing the wave functions in the appropriate coordinate system , viz .",
    "elliptical coordinates , we were able to find analytical solutions for the schrdinger equation describing an elliptical quantum dot with finite height hard walls .",
    "these functions are the mathieu functions .",
    "the condition of smoothness of the wave function at the boundary of the dot , results in an expression for the energy levels .",
    "the main effect of the elongation of the dot from a circular to an elliptic shape is a lifting of the degeneracy of the @xmath99 levels .",
    "we found exact results for the energy levels and the wave functions for arbitrary quantum numbers .",
    "the basic solutions found here may be the basis for more advanced problems with elliptic geometry , e.g. many particle quantum dots and quantum dots in a magnetic field .",
    "the results can readily be expanded to the case of an elliptic wire .",
