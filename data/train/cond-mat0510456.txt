    "complex networks , evolved from the erds - rnyi ( er ) random network @xcite , are powerful models that can simply describe complex systems in many fields such as biology , sociology , and ecology , or information infrastructure , world - wide web , and internet @xcite .",
    "in particular , some striking statistical properties in real - world complex networks have been revealed in recent years .",
    "the network models reproduce the properties and promise to understand growth and control mechanisms of the systems .",
    "one of the striking properties in the real - world networks is a scale - free feature : power - law degree distributions are defined as existence probability of nodes with degree ( number of edges ) @xmath0 ; @xmath1 with @xmath2 are empirically found @xcite .",
    "the feature can not be explained by the er model because the model shows poisson distribution .",
    "however , the barabasi - albert ( ba ) model @xcite exhibits power - law degree distributions .",
    "the model is well known as a scale - free network model and consists of the two mechanisms : growth and preferential attachment , @xmath3 denotes the probability that node @xmath4 is chosen to get an edge from the new node , and is proportional to degree of node @xmath4 ; @xmath5 . equation ( [ eq : pa ] ) means that high - degree nodes get an even better chance to attract next new edges ; the rich get richer .",
    "the model indicates that @xmath6 and the degree exponent is fixed .",
    "after that , extended ba models with modified preferential attachments , including weight @xcite or competitive @xcite dynamics , and/or local rules @xcite , rewiring , and adding of edges , are proposed to reproduce statistical properties between ba model networks and real - world networks .",
    "in addition , exponential - like distributions are often observed in real - world networks @xcite .",
    "the distributions are reproduced by an extended ba model with aging and saturation effects @xcite , nonlinear preferential attachment rule @xcite , or controllability of growth and preferential attachment @xcite .",
    "the other of the striking properties is a small - world feature : significantly high clustering coefficients @xmath7 denote density of edges between neighbors of a given node and imply clique ( cluster ) structures in the networks @xcite .",
    "the structures correspond to communities in social networks and network motifs @xcite such as feedforward and feedback loops in biological and technological networks .",
    "emergence of the clique structures in the networks are called `` transitivity phenomena '' @xcite .    in recent years",
    ", the transitivity in the many networks are actively investigated with statistical approaches and it is found that power - law clustering spectra are defined as correlations between degree @xmath0 of a given node and the clustering coefficient @xmath7 of the node ; @xmath8 with @xmath9 in rough is found in the numerical analyses @xcite .",
    "more specifically , @xmath10 exhibits around 1 , suggesting a hierarchical structure of the cliques @xcite .    in modeling approaches for the structures , the extended ba models with aging @xcite or triad formation @xcite and",
    "ravasz s hierarchical model @xcite have been proposed because of the absence of the structure in original ba networks . in particular",
    ", the hierarchical model evolves determinably with replication of complete graphs as cliques , providing a power - law clustering spectrum ; @xmath11 and degree distribution with arbitrary degree exponent .",
    "the model takes into account systematic reorganization of cliques as functional modules or communities and the consideration is important for understanding developmental processes and controls in the systems .    in this paper , we propose that an evolving network model with reorganization of cliques is constitutional unit ( basic building block ) .",
    "the model is inspired by the elimination of deterministic growing process in ravasz s hierarchical model , providing high general versatility for growing mechanisms .",
    "moreover , the model characterizes a relationship between statistical properties and compositions of the cliques .",
    "we explain details of the model in sec .",

    "here we present an evolving network model that the mechanism has the following three procedures ( see fig . [",
    "fig : mm ] ) :    a.   we start from a clique as a complete graph with @xmath12 nodes .",
    "b.   at every time step the new clique with the same size is joined by merging to existing @xmath13 node(s ) .",
    "please note that cliques are merged _ without _ adding extra links . c.   when merging the graphs , the preferential attachment ( pa ) rule , eq .",
    "( [ eq : pa ] ) , is used to select @xmath14 old nodes and resultant duplicated edge(s ) between the merged nodes are counted and contribute to pa in the next time step .",
    "[ please imagine that all edges in the clique are stretchable , then a node in the clique can reach any existing nodes .",
    "any old nodes can be targeted by node(s ) in the new clique . ]    with the @xmath15 condition , networks grow in time steps .     and @xmath16 .",
    "each clique is merged through common node(s ) without adding extra edges . ]",
    "the degree distribution is defined as the existence probability of nodes with degree @xmath0 , and is formulated as @xmath17 where @xmath18 is kronecker s delta function . to describe the degree distribution of our model we take the continuous mean - field approach used by many authors @xcite .",
    "since a network in our model evolves in every clique , the standard approach can not be applied directly .",
    "we take the following method called the coarse - graining approach to be applied to the standard continuous mean - field approach .    ) . ]",
    "let the @xmath19-size clique be regarded as a grain with @xmath20 edges ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : henkan ] ) .",
    "then , edges connecting to @xmath14 merged nodes in the clique can be considered as edges join to other grains , and @xmath21 edges in the clique are futile or do not link to the other grains .",
    "that is , the relationship between @xmath22 are the degree of a grain and @xmath5 are expressed as @xmath23 where @xmath24 corresponds to @xmath21 .",
    "now the standard approach can be applied ; a time evolution of the degree of a @xmath22 can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "the solution of the equation with @xmath27 as an initial condition for eq .",
    "( [ eq : diff - g ] ) is @xmath28 where @xmath29 represents the ratio between the number of merged node(s ) and that of all nodes in the clique",
    ". please note that eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) also satisfies the case that the clique is a regular graph or a random graph @xcite because the graphs have homogeneous degrees as well as complete graphs .    by using the continuous approach ,",
    "the probability distribution of @xmath22 can be obtained , @xmath30 substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : g - k ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ eq : p(g ) ] ) we obtain @xmath31 where @xmath32 , demonstrating that the distribution has power - law fashion and cutoff in lower degrees , and the exponent is @xmath33 equation ( [ eq : gamma ] ) shows a direct relationship between the exponent of the distribution and the ratio shown eq .",
    "( [ eq : ratio ] ) . to establish the correspondence of our model to the ba model @xcite",
    ", one can assign 2 to @xmath19 and 1 to @xmath14 ; we can calculate that the exponent in the condition is @xmath34 , showing that our model can be recognized as a more expanded model than ba .",
    "it is well known that complex networks have other statistical properties .",
    "next we step into analytical treatment of a clustering spectrum that can estimate characteristics of the hierarchy of networks modularity .",
    "the clustering spectrum is defined as @xmath35 where @xmath18 is kronecker s delta function , and @xmath36 denotes the clustering coefficient defined by @xmath37 and means density of neighboring edges of the node , where @xmath5 and @xmath38 denote the degree of node @xmath4 and the number of edges between the neighbors , respectively .    to derive the analytical solution of eq .",
    "( [ eq : clus - spec ] ) , we need to obtain the formula of @xmath38 first .",
    "the following two conditions that @xmath38 increases are need to be examined :    a.   the condition that node @xmath4 is merged to a node of a clique as a complete graph , and the other node(s ) of the clique are merged to existing nodes [ see fig . [",
