    "the discovery of the late - time cosmic acceleration reported in 1998 @xcite based on the type ia supernovae ( sn ia ) observations opened up a new field of research in cosmology .",
    "the source for this acceleration , dubbed dark energy @xcite , has been still a mystery in spite of tremendous efforts to understand its origin over the last decade @xcite .",
    "dark energy is distinguished from ordinary matter in that it has a negative pressure whose equation of state @xmath1 is close to @xmath2 .",
    "independent observational data such as sn ia @xcite , cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite , and baryon acoustic oscillations ( bao ) @xcite have continued to confirm that about 70 % of the energy density of the present universe consists of dark energy .",
    "the simplest candidate for dark energy is the so - called cosmological constant @xmath3 whose equation of state is @xmath4 .",
    "if the cosmological constant originates from a vacuum energy of particle physics , its energy scale is significantly larger than the dark energy density today @xcite ( @xmath5  gev@xmath6 ) .",
    "hence we need to find a mechanism to obtain the tiny value of @xmath3 consistent with observations .",
    "a lot of efforts have been made in this direction under the framework of particle physics .",
    "for example , the recent development of string theory shows that it is possible to construct de sitter vacua by compactifying extra dimensions in the presence of fluxes with an account of non - perturbative corrections @xcite .",
    "the first step toward understanding the property of dark energy is to clarify whether it is a simple cosmological constant or it originates from other sources that dynamically change in time .",
    "the dynamical dark energy models can be distinguished from the cosmological constant by considering the evolution of @xmath1 .",
    "the scalar field models of de such as quintessence @xcite and k - essence @xcite predict a wide variety of variations of @xmath1 , but still the current observational data are not sufficient to provide some preference of such models over the @xmath3-cold - dark - matter ( @xmath3cdm ) model .",
    "moreover , the field potentials need to be sufficiently flat such that the field evolves slowly enough to drive the present cosmic acceleration .",
    "this demands that the field mass is extremely small ( @xmath7ev ) relative to typical mass scales appearing in particle physics @xcite .",
    "however it is not entirely hopeless to construct viable scalar - field dark energy models in the framework of particle physics .",
    "we note that there is another class of modified matter models based on perfect fluids  so - called ( generalized ) the chaplygin gas model @xcite .",
    "if these models are responsible for explaining the origin of dark matter as well as dark energy , then they are severely constrained from the matter power spectrum in galaxy clustering @xcite .",
    "there exists another class of dynamical dark energy models that modify general relativity .",
    "the models that belong to this class are @xmath0 gravity @xcite ( @xmath8 is a function of the ricci scalar @xmath9 ) , scalar - tensor theories @xcite , and dvali , gabadadze and porrati ( dgp ) braneworld model @xcite .",
    "the attractive feature of these models is that the cosmic acceleration can be realized without recourse to a dark energy component . if we modify gravity from general relativity , however , there are stringent constraints coming from local gravity tests as well as a number of observational constraints such as large - scale structure ( lss ) and cmb .",
    "hence the restriction on modified gravity models is in general very tight compared to modified matter models .",
    "we shall construct viable modified gravity models and discuss their observational and experimental signatures .",
    "in addition to the above mentioned models , there are attempts to explain the cosmic acceleration without dark energy .",
    "one example is the void model in which an apparent accelerated expansion is induced by a large spatial inhomogeneity @xcite .",
    "another example is the so - called backreaction model in which the backreaction of spatial inhomogeneities on the friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) background is responsible for the real acceleration @xcite .",
    "we shall discuss these models as well .",

    "* the dgp model allows the self - acceleration of the universe , but it is effectively ruled out from observational constraints and the ghost problem . however , some of the extension of works such as galileon gravity allow the possibility for avoiding the ghost problem , while satisfying cosmological and local gravity constraints . *",
    "the models based on the inhomogeneities in the distribution of matter allow the possibility for explaining the apparent accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "the void model can be consistent with the sn ia data , but it is still challenging to satisfy all other constraints coming from the cmb and the kinematic sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "when the author submitted a review article @xcite on dark energy to international journal of modern physics d in march 2006 , we wrote in concluding section that `` over 900 papers with the words ` dark energy ' in the title have appeared on the archives since 1998 , and nearly 800 with the words ` cosmological constant ' have appeared '' .",
    "now in april 2010 , i need to change the sentence to `` over 2250 papers with the words ` dark energy ' in the title have appeared on the archives since 1998 , and nearly 1750 with the words ` cosmological constant ' have appeared '' .",
    "this means that over 4000 papers about dark energy and cosmological constant have been already written , with more than 2300 papers over the past 4 years .",
    "many cosmologists , astrophysicists , and particle physicists have extensively worked on this new field of research after the first discovery of the cosmic acceleration in 1998 .",
    "we hope that the future progress of both theory and observations will provide some exciting clue to reveal the origin of dark energy .",
    "i thank sabino matarrese to invite me to write this article in a chapter `` dark energy : investigation and modeling '' of a book published in springer .",
