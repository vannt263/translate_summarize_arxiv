    "this paper can be read as consisting of three independent parts or it can be read with a unifying story in mind . since the three parts may be of interest to different readers , and require somewhat different prerequisites , we keep them separated and try to make them reasonably self - contained . on the other hand ,",
    "the story will be of interest to some readers and so we sketch it in this introduction .",
    "we begin with a brief overview of the three parts .",
    "part i presents an investigation in categorical universal algebra . in universal algebra , a variety is a category that has a finitary presentation by operations and equations .",
    "we investigate functors on varieties that have finitary presentations by operations and equations .",
    "we will show that an endofunctor on a variety has such a presentation if and only if the functor preserves sifted colimits .",
    "part ii studies a topic in stone duality . given a small finitely complete and cocomplete category @xmath1 , one obtains a dual adjunction between the ind - completions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "we prove a jnsson - tarski style representation theorem showing how to represent algebras over @xmath2 as duals of coalgebras over @xmath3 .",
    "part iii investigates how to associate in a uniform way to a set - functor @xmath0 a logic for @xmath0-coalgebras . using the results from part i and part ii ,",
    "we show that , under a mild additional condition , any finite set - preserving functor @xmath0 has a strongly complete finitary modal logic .",
    "our story starts with the idea of universal coalgebra as a general theory of systems , due to rutten @xcite , which allows us to deal with issues such as bisimilarity , coinduction , etc in a uniform way .",
    "a natural question then is whether something similar can be done for logics of coalgebras .",
    "the first answer to this was moss s seminal coalgebraic logic  @xcite .",
    "moss s logic is parametric in @xmath0 , the basic idea being to take @xmath0 itself as an operation to construct formulas : if @xmath4 is a set of formulas , then @xmath5 is a set of formulas .",
    "following on from moss  @xcite , attention turned to the question of how to set up logics for coalgebras in which formulas are built according to a more conventional scheme : if @xmath6 is a unary operation symbol , or ` modal operator ' , and @xmath7 is a formula , then @xmath8 is a formula . after some work in this direction ,",
    "see eg @xcite , pattinson  @xcite showed that such languages arise from modal operators given by natural transformations @xmath9 , which are called predicate liftings of @xmath0 .",
    "schrder  @xcite investigated the logics given by all predicate liftings of finite arity and showed that these logics are expressive for finitary functors @xmath0 .",
    "another approach is based on stone duality . in the context of coalgebraic logic ,",
    "it was first advocated by @xcite , but is based on the ideas of domain theory in logical form @xcite .",
    "we will explain it briefly here .",
    "we think of stone duality @xcite as relating a category of algebras @xmath10 , representing a propositional logic , to a category of topological spaces @xmath11 , representing the state - based models of the logic .",
    "the duality is provided by two contravariant functors @xmath12 and @xmath13 , @xmath14^{p } & { { \\mathcal { a}}\\ } \\ar@/^/[l]^{s } .      } \\ ] ] @xmath12 maps a space @xmath15 to a propositional theory and @xmath13 maps a propositional theory to its ` canonical model ' . for the moment",
    "let us assume that @xmath10 and @xmath11 are dually equivalent , as it is the case when @xmath11 is the category @xmath16 of stone spaces and @xmath10 is the category @xmath17 of boolean algebras .",
    "this means that , from an abstract categorical point of view , the two categories are the same , up to reversal of arrows . but this ignores the extra structure which consists of both categories having a forgetful functor to @xmath18 , with @xmath19 not being dual to @xmath20 .",
    "an object of @xmath11 specifies a _ set _ of states that serves as our semantic domain ; an object of @xmath10 specifies a _ set _ of propositions , which we use to specify properties of spaces .",
    "more specifically , we will assume that @xmath10 is a variety , that is , @xmath10 is isomorphic to a category of algebras given by operations and equations , the operations being our logical connectives and the equations the logical axioms . or , equivalently , we can say that @xmath20 is finitary and monadic .",
    "to extend a basic stone duality as above to coalgebras over @xmath11 , we consider , as abramsky did in his domain theory in logical form @xcite , the dual @xmath21 of @xmath0 : @xmath22^{t } \\ar@/^/[r]^{p } & { { \\mathcal { a}}\\ } \\ar@/^/[l]^{s }       \\ar@(dr , ur)[]_{l } }   \\quad\\quad\\quad\\quad lp{\\cong}pt\\ ] ] then the category of @xmath21-algebras is dual to the category of @xmath0-coalgebras and the initial @xmath21-algebra provides a propositional theory characterising @xmath0-bisimilarity .",
    "moreover , if @xmath21 can be presented by generators and relations , or rather operations and equations , one inherits a proof system from equational logic which is sound and strongly complete .",
    "logics for @xmath0-coalgebras arise from presentations of the dual of @xmath0 by operations and equations_. part i characterises those functors @xmath21 on varieties @xmath10 that have a finitary presentation by operations and equations .",
    "the approach indicated in diagram  [ zwei ] can be applied to set - coalgebras , but as the dual of @xmath18 is the category @xmath23 of _ complete _ atomic boolean algebras , the corresponding logics would become infinitary .",
    "hence , being interested in finitary logics , we are led to consider two stone dualities @xmath24^ { }      &          { { \\mathsf{ba } } } \\ar@/^/[l]^{}\\ar@(dr , ur)[]_{l }      \\\\       { { \\mathsf{set } } } \\ar@(dl , ul)[]^{t } \\ar@/^/[r]^ { }      &          { { \\mathsf{caba } } } \\ar@/^/[l]^{}}\\ ] ] the upper row is the duality between stone spaces and boolean algebras , accounting for ( classical finitary ) propositional logic .",
    "the lower row is the duality where our set - based @xmath0-coalgebras live . how can the two be related ?",
    "the crucial observation is the following .",
    "@xmath17 is the ind - completion of the category @xmath25 of finite boolean algebras , that is , the completion of finite boolean algebras under filtered colimits ; @xmath18 is the ind - completion of the category @xmath26 of finite sets ; and finite sets are dually equivalent to finite boolean algebras . in other words , @xmath27 is the pro - completion of finite boolean algebras , that is , the completion of finite boolean algebras under cofiltered limits . @xmath28^{l \\ }       \\ar@/_/[rr]_{s }   & &        { { \\mathsf{set}}{^{\\mathrm{op}}}}\\ar@/_/[ll]_{p } \\ar@(dr , ur)[]_{\\ t{^{\\mathrm{op } } } }        \\\\       & \\ar[ul]^{\\hat{(- ) } } { \\mathsf{ba}}_\\omega\\simeq{\\mathsf{set}}_\\omega{^{\\mathrm{op}}}\\ar[ur]_{\\bar{(- ) } } &     } \\ ] ] this gives us a systematic link between boolean propositional logic and its set - theoretic semantic .",
    "it is extended to modal logics and their coalgebraic semantics by a natural transformation @xmath29 lifting @xmath12 to a functor @xmath30 . not in general , but in a large number of important examples , we also obtain a ( not necessarily natural ) transformation @xmath31 giving rise to a map on objects @xmath32 .",
    "part ii shows that then every @xmath21-algebra @xmath33 can be embedded into the @xmath12-image of a @xmath0-coalgebra , namely , into @xmath34 .",
    "this extends the jnsson - tarski theorem from kripke frames ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 5.43 ) to coalgebras and shows that the logics @xmath21 are canonical in the sense that all formulas hold in the underlying frame of the canonical model @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is the lindenbaum - algebra of @xmath21 .",
    "starting from an arbitrary functor @xmath37 , part iii shows first how to define a suitable @xmath21 . from part",
    "i , we know that @xmath21 has a presentation by operations and equations and therefore corresponds to a ` concrete ' modal logic in the traditional sense .",
    "this is detailed in section  [ sec : ml - abs - concr ] .",
    "section  [ sec : ml - set ] then applies the jnsson - tarski theorem from part ii to obtain strong completeness results for modal logics for coalgebras .    * further related work * unary predicate liftings and a criterion for weak completeness go back to pattinson @xcite .",
    "the observation that all logics given by predicate liftings correspond to a functor @xmath21 on @xmath17 was made in @xcite , with the approach of functorial modal logic going back to @xcite .",
    "the logic of all predicate liftings of finite arity was introduced in schrder  @xcite .",
    "our notion of a presentation of a functor and the fact that such presentations give rise to modal logics is from @xcite .",
    "the jnsson - tarski theorem of this paper generalises the corresponding theorem in @xcite .",
    "the process of taking a finite set preserving functor and extending it to @xmath17 , and hence to @xmath16 , is related to a construction in worrell  @xcite where a set - functor is lifted to complete ultrametric spaces .",
    "klin  @xcite generalises the expressivity result of @xcite working essentially with the same adjunction as in diagram  [ zwei ] .    since an earlier version of the paper",
    "was made available in june 2006 , the field continued to develop quickly .",
    "for example , schrder  @xcite improves on @xcite by showing that complete axiomatisations always exist and , moreover , that completeness holds wrt finite models .",
    "@xcite uses stone duality and algebraic techniques to derive conditions for the finite model property of logics with additional non - rank-1 axioms .",
    "schrder and pattinson  @xcite push the strong completeness result of this paper further and add several important examples .",

    "there is a general agreement that algebras over a category @xmath10 are described by means of a monad @xmath38 ( see @xcite ) . in the case when @xmath10 is the category @xmath18 of sets , the category @xmath39 of algebras over a monad @xmath40 always has a _ presentation _ in the sense that there exists a signature @xmath41 ( allowing infinite arities ) and equations @xmath42 such that @xmath39 is concretely isomorphic to the category @xmath43 of @xmath44-algebras .",
    "both @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be proper classes but the characteristic property is that free @xmath44-algebras always exist .",
    "this allows compact hausdorff spaces and complete atomic boolean algebras but eliminates complete boolean algebras .",
    "the important special case is when a monad @xmath45 has a rank which means that it preserves @xmath46-filtered colimits for some regular cardinal @xmath46 .",
    "it corresponds to the case when @xmath41 is a set ( and @xmath46 is greater than arities of all @xmath41-operations ) .",
    "in particular , algebras over a monad preserving filtered colimits ( such functors are called _ finitary _ ) then correspond to classical universal algebras .",
    "alternatively and equivalently , classical universal algebras can be described by algebraic theories ( see lawvere @xcite ) . recall that an _ algebraic theory _ is a category @xmath47 whose objects are integers @xmath48 and such that @xmath49 is a product of @xmath49 copies of @xmath50 for each @xmath51 .",
    "it means that @xmath47 has finite products and , in particular , a terminal object @xmath52 .",
    "intuitively , arrows @xmath53 represent @xmath49-ary terms and commuting diagrams represent equations . an algebraic theory",
    "@xmath47 determines the category @xmath54 which is the full subcategory of @xmath55 consisting of all functors @xmath56 preserving finite products .",
    "the underlying functor @xmath57 is given by the evaluation at @xmath50 .",
    "a category is called a _ variety _ if it is equivalent to @xmath54 for some algebraic theory @xmath47 .",
    "given a category @xmath10 with finite products and an algebraic theory @xmath47 , one can still define @xmath47-algebras in @xmath10 as finite product preserving functors @xmath58 and consider the category @xmath59 of these algebras .",
    "in general , there is no guarantee that this category is monadic over @xmath10 because free algebras do not need to exist .",
    "but , whenever @xmath10 is locally presentable ( see @xcite ) , @xmath59 is always monadic and the corresponding monad @xmath38 has a rank . in particular , when @xmath10 is locally finitely presentable , @xmath45 is finitary .",
    "but one can not expect that each finitary monad is determined by an algebraic theory .",
    "a typical example is when @xmath10 is the category @xmath60 of vector spaces over a field @xmath12 .",
    "important binary operations are not given by linear maps @xmath61 but by bilinear ones .",
    "so , linear universal algebra deals with operations @xmath62 .",
    "the corresponding `` tensor algebraic theories '' were introduced by mac lane @xcite under the names of prop s and pact s and led to the concept of an _",
    "operad_. we recommend @xcite to learn about linear universal algebra .",
    "one can describe algebras over a monad @xmath38 for an arbitrary category @xmath10 by means of `` operations and equations '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , arities of operations are not natural numbers but objects of @xmath10 .",
    "for instance , by taking the category of posets , binary operations whose arity is a two - element chain are defined only for pairs of comparable elements .",
    "it is just the special feature of @xmath18 that , besides being cartesian closed , finite sets are coproducts of @xmath50 which makes algebraic theories powerful enough to cover finitary monads .",
    "filtered categories are precisely categories @xmath63 such that colimits over @xmath63 commute with finite limits in @xmath18 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "there is also a characterization of filtered categories independent of sets  a category @xmath63 is filtered if and only if the diagonal functor @xmath64 is final for each finite category @xmath65 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it makes filtered colimits belong more to the `` doctrine of finite limits '' than to that of finite products .",
    "it appears as the fact that algebras over a finitary monad do not need to `` look like algebras '' .",
    "for example , the category of torsion free abelian groups is the category of algebras for the monad @xmath66 on the category @xmath67 of abelian groups given by the reflection to torsion free ones .",
    "this monad is finitary because torsion free groups are closed under filtered colimits in @xmath67 but to be torsion free is not equationally definable .",
    "it would be more appropriate to consider categories @xmath63 such that colimits over @xmath63 commute with finite products .",
    "these categories are called sifted and are characterized by the property that the diagonal functor @xmath68 is final ( see @xcite ) .",
    "explicitely , a category @xmath63 is * sifted * , if it is non - empty and for all objects @xmath69 the category @xmath70 of cospans is connected . here",
    ", @xmath70 has as objects pairs of arrows @xmath71 and arrows @xmath72 are given by arrows @xmath73 such that @xmath74 .",
    "a category is connected if it is non - empty and can not be decomposed into a disjoint union ( coproduct ) of two non - empty subcategories .",
    "each filtered category is sifted but there are sifted categories which are not filtered ",
    "the most important example are reflexive pairs ( a parallel pair of morphisms @xmath75 is reflexive if there is @xmath76 with @xmath77 ) .",
    "another special feature of sets is that any finitary functor @xmath78 preserves sifted colimits .",
    "but it is not true for @xmath67  the torsion free monad above does not preserve sifted colimits .",
    "the consequence is that torsion free groups do not form a variety of universal algebras .",
    "we can define algebras over an arbitrary functor @xmath79 ; an @xmath21-_algebra _ @xmath80 is a pair consisting of an object @xmath33 and a morphism @xmath81 . in the case",
    "when @xmath21 is a monad , these @xmath21-algebras are more general than algebras over a monad @xmath21 because the latter have to satisfy some equations .",
    "morphisms @xmath82 are morphisms @xmath83 such that @xmath84 .",
    "the resulting category of @xmath21-algebras is denoted by @xmath85 . like in the case of general equational theories @xmath44 , free @xmath21-algebras",
    "do not need to exists .",
    "if they exist , the category @xmath85 is monadic over @xmath10 with respect to the forgetful functor @xmath86 sending an @xmath21-algebra @xmath80 to @xmath33 . given a functor @xmath79 , algebras over @xmath87 are called @xmath21-_coalgebras_.",
    "the concept of a locally finitely presentable category stems from that of a filtered colimit , i.e. , belongs to the doctrine of finite limits . recall that an object @xmath33 of a category @xmath10 is finitely presentable if its hom - functor @xmath88 preserves filtered colimits . a category @xmath10 is locally finitely presentable if it is cocomplete and has a set @xmath11 of finitely presentable objects such that each object of @xmath10 is a filtered colimit of objects from @xmath11 . by changing the doctrine from finite limits to finite products ,",
    "we replace filtered colimits by sifted ones .",
    "we say that an object @xmath33 is _ strongly finitely presentable _ if its hom - functor @xmath88 preserves sifted colimits .",
    "a category @xmath10 is _ strongly locally finitely presentable _ if it is cocomplete and has a set @xmath11 of strongly finitely presentable objects such that each object of @xmath10 is a sifted colimit of objects from @xmath11 .",
    "these categories were introduced in @xcite where it was shown that they are precisely categories of algebras over many - sorted algebraic theories in @xmath18 . recall that a _ many - sorted algebraic theory _",
    "@xmath47 is a small category with finite products and a @xmath47-algebra in @xmath18 is a functor @xmath56 preserving finite products . in particular ,",
    "each variety is strongly locally finitely presentable .",
    "( note that our usage differs from that of @xcite where varieties are given by many - sorted algebraic theories . ) while finitely presentable objects in @xmath54 are algebras finitely presentable in a usual sense , i.e. , given by a finite set of generators subjected to a finite set of equations , strongly finitely presentable algebras are precisely retracts of finitely generated free algebras , i.e. , finitely presentable projective algebras .",
    "an important fact is that each finitely presentable algebra is a reflexive coequalizer of strongly finitely presentable ones ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ( 2 ) ) ) .",
    "every strongly locally finitely presentable category @xmath10 is locally finitely presentable and has , up to isomorphism , only a set of strongly finitely presentable objects .",
    "we will denote by @xmath89 the corresponding full subcategory of @xmath10 . in the same way",
    ", @xmath90 denotes a representative small full subcategory of finitely presentable objects .",
    "given a strongly locally finitely presentable category @xmath10 and a category @xmath91 having sifted colimits then a sifted colimit preserving functor @xmath92 is fully determined by its values on strongly finitely presentable objects .",
    "in fact , @xmath10 is a free completion of @xmath89 , i.e. , each functor @xmath93 extends to a functor @xmath94 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , it applies to functors @xmath95 . in analogy to @xcite ,",
    "remark 2.75 , we can prove the following basic result .",
    "[ thm : sfp ] let @xmath10 be a strongly locally finitely presentable category and @xmath79 preserve sifted colimits .",
    "then @xmath85 is strongly locally finitely presentable .",

    "hence the forgetful functor @xmath96 has a left adjoint @xmath97 ( see @xcite , 1.66 ) .",
    "thus @xmath98 is monadic , i.e. , each @xmath21-algebra @xmath15 admits a regular epimorphism @xmath99 from some free @xmath21-algebra . since @xmath10 is strongly locally finitely presentable , @xmath33 is a sifted colimit of strongly finitely presentable objects .",
    "hence @xmath100 is a sifted colimit of free algebras over strongly finitely presentable objects .",
    "thus there is a regular epimorphism from a coproduct of free algebras over strongly finitely presentable objects to @xmath100 .",

    "* summary * the purpose of the paper was to associate a finitary modal logic to a functor @xmath0 , so that the logic is strongly complete wrt @xmath0-coalgebras .",

    "one presents @xmath21 by operations and equations and we characterised those functors on a variety that have a presentation ( theorem  [ thm : present - sift ] ) in part i. this result is based on the fundamental role that sifted colimits play in the category theoretic analysis of universal algebra , see @xcite .    to obtain strong completeness of the logic , we showed in part ii how to present @xmath21-algebras as @xmath0-coalgebras , theorem  [ thm : indpro ] .",
    "this can be considered as the jnsson - tarski theorem for @xmath21-algebras and @xmath0-coalgebras .",
    "part iii shows how an arbitrary @xmath37 gives rise to a logic @xmath568 . by part",
    "i , we know that @xmath568 has a presentation and , therefore , corresponds to a modal logic given by operations and equations .",
    "applying the representation theorem of part ii , we obtain that under additional conditions on @xmath0 , this logic is strongly complete for @xmath0-coalgebras .",
    "an interesting point is that we do not need the assumption that @xmath0 is finitary .",
    "this assumption is powerful when working with @xmath0-algebras , but it is much less so for @xmath0-coalgebras .",
    "similarly , we do not need that @xmath0 preserves weak pullbacks .",
    "each of these assumptions would exclude fundamental examples .",
    "* further work * an important aspect of this work is that it makes use of the notion of the presentation of a functor in order to separate syntax and semantics .",
    "for example , the strong completeness proof of theorem  [ thm : jons - tars ] is conducted  via theorem  [ thm : indpro]in terms of abstract category theoretic properties of the logic @xmath404 and is independent of a choice of concrete presentation .",
    "this approach was also used in @xcite , which proves a goldblatt - thomason style theorem for coalgebras , and in @xcite , which compares and translates logics given by predicate liftings and moss s coalgebraic logic .",
    "this is based on the observation that the notion of a coalgebraic logic @xmath404 also accounts for moss s logic and makes it amenable to a study via stone duality .",
    "this idea was also used in @xcite to give a completeness proof for an axiomatisation of the finitary boolean version of moss s logic .",
    "another important feature of our approach , which goes back to @xcite , is that it is modular in the sense that the presentation of @xmath85 is obtained by composing a presentation of the base category with a presentation of @xmath21 , see theorem  [ thm : present - fun ] .",
    "this can be extended to a formalism that allows to compose the presentation of @xmath637 from presentations of @xmath638 and of @xmath639 @xcite .",
    "this requires to move to many - sorted universal algebra and @xcite also investigates further applications of the many - sorted generalisation to the semantics of first - order logic and presheaf models of name - binding .",
    "@xcite exploits that the nominal algebra @xcite of gabbay and mathijssen and the nominal equational logic @xcite of clouston and pitts gives rise to theories which correspond to sifted colimit preserving monads on the category @xmath640 of nominal sets and can thus be viewed as equational theories of many - sorted set - based universal algebra .",

    "<S> moreover , the presentation of the category of algebras for the functor is obtained compositionally from the presentations of the underlying category and of the functor .    </S>",
    "<S> part ii investigates algebras for a functor over ind - completions and extends the theorem of jnsson and tarski on canonical extensions of boolean algebras with operators to this setting .    </S>",
    "<S> part iii shows , based on part i , how to associate a finitary logic to any finite - sets preserving functor @xmath0 . based on part </S>",
    "<S> ii we prove the logic to be strongly complete under a reasonable condition on @xmath0 . </S>"
