    "we have carried out the largest search for fractional electric charge elementary particles in bulk matter using 70.1  mg of silicone oil .",
    "that is , we looked for stable particles whose charge @xmath2 deviates from @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an integer , and @xmath5 is the electron charge .",
    "no evidence for such particles was found .",
    "we used our new version @xcite of the millikan oil drop method containing two innovations compared to the classical method that we used in halyo @xcite .",
    "one innovation is that the drop charge is obtained by observing the drop motion in a _ horizontal _ , alternating electric field compared to the classical use of a vertical electric field .",
    "the other innovation is the use of an upward flow of air to reduce the vertical terminal velocity of the drop , which enabled us to use larger drops , about 20.6  @xmath6 m in diameter compared to the 10  @xmath6 m drops used in our previous experiments .",
    "figure  [ fig : principle ] depicts the principle of the technique .",
    "recent advances in inkjet printing technology and computer imaging are the key enabling technologies behind the experiment .",
    "the apparatus is built around a micromachined @xcite , drop - on - demand fluid ejector , and a digital charge - coupled device ( ccd ) camera .",
    "the drop ejector produces extremely uniform oil drops with radii constant to @xmath7 .",
    "this ability to precisely control the drop radius , in addition to the large statistics gained by measuring many drops , allows the experiment to be self - calibrating , significantly reducing the possibility of an artifact .",
    "the experiment is completely automated .",
    "the measurement region , approximately 2.3  mm horizontally by 3.0  mm vertically , is viewed by the ccd camera producing a 10  hz stream of images in 8  bit greyscale at @xmath8 pixel resolution .",
    "this data is acquired , stored , and analyzed in real - time using custom written software .",
    "this software analyzes the images , measuring the positions of the drops to sub - pixel accuracy , and performs pattern recognition to identify the trajectories of individual drops .",
    "the charge @xmath2 on each drop is calculated from the best possible fit to the measured trajectory , where the precision is primarily limited by brownian motion .",
    "data was collected for 30 weeks . from this sample , approximately @xmath9 of the drops",
    "were rejected using predetermined selection criteria .",
    "these selection criteria eliminated incorrectly measured drops , and were unbiased with regard to fractional charge . a total of @xmath10 drops were accepted into the final data sample .",
    "the resulting distributions of @xmath2 and the residual charge @xmath11 , defined to be @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the largest integer less than @xmath14 , are shown in figure  [ fig : results ] .",
    "no drops with fractional charge were observed , yielding a 95% confidence level upper limit on the abundance of fractional charge particles in silicone oil , for @xmath15 , of @xmath16 particles per nucleon .",
    "this result is described in detail in lee @xcite .",
    "this experiment was performed at slac under the direction of martin perl , and in collaboration with sewan fan , valerie halyo , peter c. kim , eric r. lee , dinesh loomba , and howard rogers .",
    "thanks also to klaus s. lackner and gordon shaw ."
