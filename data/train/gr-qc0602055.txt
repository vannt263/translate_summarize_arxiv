    "in recent years , some attempts have been made to derive a late time accelerating universe from a fundamental theory of particle physics that incorporates gravity , like m theory or superstring theory .",
    "this process involves a compactification of eleven or ten- dimensional einstein gravity to four dimensions . the no - go theorem states that we could not obtain accelerating universes in the einstein frame in four dimensions by compactification of pure einstein gravity in higher dimensions when the six or seven- dimensional internal space is a time independent nonsingular compact manifold without boundary @xcite .",
    "so any attempt to derive an accelerating universe must circumvent the no - go theorem .",
    "townsend and wohlfarth invoked a time dependent compactification of pure gravity in higher dimensions with hyperbolic internal space to circumvent the no - go theorem @xcite .",
    "their exact solution to the vacuum einstein gravity in higher dimensions exhibits a short period of acceleration or transient acceleration which ca nt explain the early inflation but may be used to explain the late time acceleration of our universe .",
    "the solution is the zero flux limit of spacelike branes as shown in @xcite .",
    "if non - zero flux or forms are turned on , then it is shown that a transient acceleration exists for both compact internal hyperbolic and flat spaces @xcite .",
    "other accelerating solutions were found by compactifying more complicated time dependent internal spaces [ 6 - 15 ] . when higher order corrections were added to the higher dimensional supergravity theory , inflationary solution was also found @xcite .",
    "the application of time dependent compactification sheds some lights on the resolution of the late time acceleration within a fundamental theoretical framework",
    ". however , there is no stable point in the size of the internal space when the internal space is time dependent .",
    "this seems to be the common feature . from our four dimensional point of view",
    ", the negatively curved internal space provides a positive exponential potential .",
    "the generic feature of the potential is that it is too steep to sustain an eternal acceleration . in a realistic cosmological set up ,",
    "matter and radiation are present in addition to the scalar field coming from the dimensional reduction , then the evolution of the scalar field will be different .",
    "it is worthy of studying whether the scalar field is dominant now and it provides the late time acceleration when matter and radiation are present .",
    "therefore , we will study the model with matter and scalar field which comes from the time dependent compactification of m theory .",
    "we also discuss the evolution of the fine structure constant due to the time dependence of the internal space .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will review the basic results of dimensional reduction . in section 3 , we will discuss the evolution of the scalar field when matter and radiation are included . in section 4 , we conclude the paper with some discussions .",
    "we start with the the bosonic part of the low energy effective action for m theory ( @xmath0 ) or superstrings ( @xmath1 ) in @xmath2 dimensions : @xmath3 where we have dropped contributions from forms and dilations which are assumed to be stabilized when they exist , @xmath4 is the @xmath2 dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "when we decompose the @xmath2 dimensional space - time into @xmath5 dimensional space - time with the metric @xmath6 , here the second half of the lower case latin letters run from @xmath7 to @xmath8 and the greek letters run from @xmath9 to @xmath10 , we get @xmath11.\\ ] ] after the conformal transformation @xmath12 we get the four dimensional low energy effective action in einstein frame @xmath13,\\ ] ] where @xmath14 is the volume of the @xmath8 dimensional internal space with the metric @xmath15 and @xmath16 is assumed to be a constant .",
    "it is evident that we can identify @xmath17 as the canonical scalar field in 4 dimensions , where @xmath18 is the four dimensional gravitational constant .",
    "since we are interested in cosmological solutions , we take the metric of our @xmath2 dimensional space - time as @xmath19 . the time @xmath20 and the scale factor",
    "@xmath21 are the four dimensional quantities in einstein frame . with this metric",
    ", we have @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the vacuum einstein equations are @xmath26 equations ( [ vaceq1]-[vaceq3 ] ) are not totally independent . for example , equation ( [ vaceq3 ] ) can be derived from equations ( [ vaceq1 ] ) and ( [ vaceq2 ] ) . in the following , we will assume our four dimensional universe is flat so that @xmath27 . to solve the above equations , we change the time coordinate @xmath20 to @xmath28 so that @xmath29 and we use @xmath30 to denote the derivative with respect to @xmath28 in this section . by using @xmath28 , equations ( [ vaceq1]-[vaceq3 ] )",
    "become @xmath31 let @xmath32 , then equations ( [ vaceq5 ] ) and ( [ vaceq6 ] ) give @xmath33 , so @xmath34 .",
    "take @xmath35 , equations ( [ vaceq5 ] ) and ( [ vaceq6 ] ) give @xmath36 , so @xmath37 $ ] .",
    "substitute the above solutions to equation ( [ vaceq4 ] ) , we get the relationship @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , after re - scaling of @xmath28 with the choice @xmath39 and @xmath40 , the general solution is @xmath41\\sinh^{-d/2(d+1)}\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{3(d+2)}{d}}|\\eta|\\right],\\\\ \\label{sol2 }   b(\\eta)=b \\exp\\left ( -\\frac{3}{d-1}\\eta\\right)\\sinh^{-1/(d-1)}\\left[\\sqrt{\\frac{3(d+2)}{d}}|\\eta|\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42^{-1/2(d-1)}$ ] and @xmath43 .",
    "so @xmath44 and @xmath45 when @xmath46 if @xmath47 . in terms of @xmath28 ,",
    "the universe starts from @xmath48 and the infinite future time is @xmath49 . because @xmath50,\\ ] ] so we have @xmath51 if @xmath47 , i.e. , the universe expands . to get acceleration @xmath52 , we need to require @xmath53=m(\\eta).\\ ] ] the evolution of @xmath54 is shown in figure 1 .",
    "we see that there exists a period of acceleration",
    ". however , the duration of acceleration is not long enough to explain the flatness and horizon problems , but it can be used to explain the late time acceleration . note that @xmath55,\\ ] ] it is possible that @xmath56 when @xmath57 , i.e. , at late times or in the far future , the volume of extra dimensions will increase . in the far future , @xmath57 , we have @xmath58 therefore , extra dimensions will manifest themselves in the future .     axis .",
    "the dotted line plots the evolution of the ratio of @xmath59 by using the right @xmath60 axis . in this plot , some constants of proportionality are not included.,width=453 ]",
    "from four dimensional point of view , equations ( [ vaceq1]-[vaceq3 ] ) describe the standard cosmology plus a scalar field @xmath61 with the exponential potential @xmath62\\exp(-\\sqrt{2(d+2)/d}\\ , \\phi / m_{pl})$ ] as the matter source .",
    "since we are interested in the late time acceleration instead of the early time inflation , we should also include radiation and dust in the matter contents .",
    "with all these matter sources , the standard cosmology is @xmath63,\\\\ \\label{eq2 } \\ddot{\\phi}+3h\\dot{\\phi}+\\frac{d v(\\phi)}{d\\phi}=0,\\\\ \\label{eq3 } \\frac{\\ddot{a}}{a}=-\\frac{1}{3m_{pl}^2}\\left[\\frac{1}{2}\\rho_m+\\rho_r+\\dot{\\phi}^2-v(\\phi)\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the subscript @xmath9 means the present value of the variable . without dust and radiation , the universe with the scalar field experiences a transient acceleration as discussed in the previous section .",
    "here we are concerned with the question if the acceleration persists when dust and radiation are present . for a cosmology with a barotropic fluid which has an equation of state @xmath66 and a scalarfield which has the exponential potential @xmath67 , it was found that @xcite :    \\(1 ) @xmath68 . the late time attraction solution is the tracking solution in which the evolution of the scalar field mimics that of the barotropic fluid with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , where @xmath71 .",
    "\\(2 ) @xmath72 .",
    "the late time attraction solution is the scalar field dominated solution with @xmath73 and @xmath74 .    for the scalar field coming from compactification , we have @xmath75 .",
    "so the late time attractor solution is the scalar field dominated power - law solution and the equation of state parameter of the scalar field is @xmath76 if we take @xmath77 , we get @xmath78 .",
    "if we take @xmath79 , we get @xmath80 .",
    "the late time attractor solution gives a decelerating universe .",
    "whatever the initial conditions of the scalar field are , the scalar field can always start from subdominant at early times and become dominant at late times . in",
    "order for the scalar field to contribute about 70% to the total energy density and provide an accelerating universe at present time , it must have not reached the fixed point yet .",
    "therefore it is necessary to fine - tune the initial conditions of the scalar field @xcite .",
    "before we study the fine - tuning problem , we would like to further examine the exact solutions obtained in the previous section first . by using the exact solutions ( [ sol1 ] ) and ( [ sol2 ] )",
    ", we get the energy density for the scalar field @xmath81 @xmath82.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath83 , the evolution of @xmath59 is shown in figure [ fig1 ] . during the acceleration phase , we see that the ratio of @xmath59 increases with time . therefore , we expect the scalar field contributes more and more to the total energy density .",
    "now we are ready to solve equations ( [ eq1])-([eq3 ] ) numerically .",
    "it is more convenient to use the variable @xmath84 instead of the cosmic time @xmath20 .",
    "let @xmath85 , equations ( [ eq1 ] ) and ( [ eq2 ] ) become @xmath86y',\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and we use @xmath30 to denote differentiation with respect to @xmath92 in this section . by using equation ( [ eq3 ] )",
    ", we get @xmath93 from equation ( [ numeq3 ] ) , we can see that @xmath94 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath95 is small at early times , so @xmath96 must also be small at early times . therefore , @xmath96 is small from the past to the present , which means that the scalar field changes very slowly . in other words , the scalar field behaves more like a cosmological constant so that @xmath97 and @xmath98 at nucleosynthesis when @xmath99 . from equation ( [ numeq2 ] )",
    ", we see that at very early time when radiation was dominated , @xmath100 .",
    "so for small positive @xmath96 , @xmath96 will decrease first until it reaches below @xmath101 , then it will start to increase again .",
    "that is another way to see why the scalar field changes very slowly . in the recent past , we have @xmath102 , so @xmath96 became relatively large and the scalar field would change relatively fast in the recent past . for the numerical calculation ,",
    "we start from the epoch of nucleosyntheis around @xmath99 or @xmath103 .",
    "the initial conditions are chosen as @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath95 , @xmath106 and @xmath107 are shown in figure [ fig2 ] .    .",
    "the solid line is for @xmath95 , the dashed line is for @xmath107 and the dotted line is for @xmath106.,width=453 ]    with the choice of the initial conditions of the scalar field , the behaviors of the energy densities are consistent with the current observations .",
    "we also plot the evolutions of the dimensionless acceleration @xmath108 and the scalar field in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "is plotted by the solid line by using the left @xmath60 axis .",
    "the dashed line plots the evolution of the scalar field @xmath81 by using the right @xmath60 axis.,width=453 ]    from figure [ fig3 ] , we see that the scalar field increases very slowly for most of the time and it starts to increase relatively fast in the recent past when it became to dominate the energy component . this behavior confirmed the above discussions .",
    "@xmath109 increases about @xmath110 during the whole period of evolution , so the volume increases about @xmath111 times .",
    "upon compactification of pure gravity in higher dimensions with time dependent hyperbolic internal space , we get a scalar field with exponential potential in four dimensions .",
    "the potential of the scalar field is too steep to give an accelerated attractor solution . with suitable fine - tuning of the initial conditions of the scalar field",
    ", our universe experiences a transient acceleration now .",
    "the scalar field changed very slowly until recently and it behaves like a cosmological constant . due to the scalar field dynamics , the volume of the internal space increases about @xmath112 times . in the far future , the internal space will become infinite and @xmath113 goes to @xmath114 asymptotically . the change of the volume of the internal space results in the variation of the fundamental constants . cline and vinet found that the time variation of the gravitational constant violated the observational constraint in the string frame for time - varying extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "it is known that the effective four dimensional fine structure constant is inversely proportional to the volume of the internal space , so @xmath115 the experimental data gives @xmath116 yr@xmath117 @xcite .",
    "substitute this constraint and @xmath118 to equation ( [ fine ] ) , we get @xmath119 ) is violated at present .",
    "although the time dependent compactification of m theory or superstring theory can give a transient acceleration which is consistent with the current astronomical observations , the time variation of the internal space will result in large variation of the fine structure constant .",
    "this result is quite general and can apply to other models with transient acceleration .",
    "the change of fine structure constant due to time dependent internal space was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "they discussed the scalar field dominated region only . in our discussion , we include radiation and cold dark matter , so our result is more general .",
