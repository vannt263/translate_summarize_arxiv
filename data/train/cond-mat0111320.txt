    "bosonization analyses@xcite together with finite size numerical work using the dmrg@xcite and other methods@xcite have given a clear understanding of the behavior of the 2-leg hubbard and @xmath0 ladder models .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian is written : @xmath3 here @xmath4 destroys an electron on rung @xmath5 and leg @xmath6 with spin @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 is the electron number operator .",
    "the @xmath0 hamiltonian is : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and the hilbert space now excludes all states with doubly - occupied sites .",
    "we will generally set @xmath11 in what follows .",
    "both models are expected to be in a `` c1s0 '' phase , over a wide range of parameters , in which the low energy degrees of freedom consist of a single free massless charge boson , whose excitations carry even multiples of the electron charge . this is often characterized as a `` d - wave superconductor '' based on the nature of the power law decay of pair correlations which have a positive sign for singlet rung - rung or leg - leg correlations and a negative sign for rung - leg correlations .",
    "both bosonization and dmrg results exist on multi - leg ladders with analytical and numerical uncertainty which increase with the number of legs .",
    "most of the dmrg data is obtained with open boundary conditions along the legs of the ladder . unlike with periodic boundary conditions , this generally leads to charge density oscillations in the groundstate .",
    "if these oscillations persist at the center of the chain for arbitrarily long chain length then they correspond to a charge density wave ( cdw ) .",
    "more commonly , they decay away from the boundaries with a power law , in the limit of an infinite chain . in this case , we may think of them as generalized friedel oscillations where the chain ends themselves act as impurities which induce gradually decaying density oscillations . unlike in a fermi liquid",
    ", these generalized friedel oscillations in a luttinger liquid decay with an exponent which depends on the interaction strength , and which is simply related to the density correlation exponent.@xcite furthermore , the wave - vector of the oscillations itself can be changed by the interactions .",
    "these density oscillations , for the largest systems studied , up to eight legs , have been identified with `` stripes''.@xcite an understanding of the occurance of stripes in these models , whether or not they require long range coulomb interactions to exist and their connection with superconducitivity are important open problems .",
    "since any ladder system is ultimately one - dimensional if the number of legs is held fixed and the length taken to @xmath12 , the friedel oscillations /cdw analysis may provide the appropriate description of stripe behavior , at least in this limit and in cases where the stripe wave - vector is parallel to the chains .    in sec .",
    "ii we briefly review the bosonization picture of the 2-leg @xmath0 ladder .",
    "we also present a technique for extracting the correlation exponent purely from data with open boundary conditions which has not , to our knowledge , been used previously on ladders , although it has been used on chains .",
    "this method is used to obtain values for the charge velocity and exponent . in sec .",
    "iii we review the bosonization treatment of commensurate charge density waves and the related behavior of the correlation exponent , and analyse data on the 2 leg tj model at electron density @xmath13 , showing that a cdw may occur for weak enough @xmath14 . in sec .",
    "iv we review friedel oscillations in luttinger liquids and apply this analysis to data on the single chain hubbard and @xmath0 model and the 2 leg @xmath0 model .",
    "a convenient starting point for bosonization is the weak coupling hubbard model version of the 2-leg ladder , eq .",
    "( [ hhubb ] ) with @xmath15 small .",
    "it is then far from obvious that this analysis will apply to the infinite coupling limit , corresponding to the @xmath0 model of eq .",
    "( [ htj ] ) so that comparisons with numerical results is important . in the weak coupling limit",
    "we may start by diagonalizing the non - interacting problem , giving symmetric and anti - symmetric electron operators @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 labels even and odd channels .",
    "we pass to the continuum limit by introducing left and right moving fields : @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 the fermi wave vectors for the two bands . in the usual way",
    ", we represent the left and right moving fermion fields by left and right moving boson fields : @xmath22 and then , introducing the dual canonical bose fields , @xmath23 it is then convenient to introduce spin and charge bosons , for each channel : @xmath24 and then , finally , switch to the two linear combinations of the even and odd bosons : @xmath25 with similar relations for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 .",
    "actually , this last transformation is not canonical when the even and odd bosons have different velocities .",
    "however , we will follow the standard practice @xcite of assuming that this velocity difference is irrelevant .",
    "a renormalization group analysis , based on the weak coupling hubbard model , suggests that the cosine interactions `` pin '' the bosons @xmath29 and @xmath30 , introducing excitation energy gaps for these bosons and leaving @xmath31 as the only massless boson which thus describes the low energy excitations .",
    "all interactions involving @xmath31 , @xmath32 are irrelelvant in this phase .",
    "the low energy effective hamiltonian can be written : @xmath33,\\label{ham}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is the momentum density variable canonically conjugate to @xmath32 , @xmath35 is the velocity of the corresponding gapless low energy excitations and the parameter @xmath36 controls the correlation exponents .",
    "( our definition of @xmath36 corresponds to that of schulz@xcite and hayward and poilblanc@xcite but is the inverse of the parameter with the same name in balents and fisher.@xcite ) the hamiltonian may be equally well written in terms of the other boson field @xmath31 and its conjugate momentum using : @xmath37 the two parameters , @xmath35 and @xmath36 are generally difficult to calculate analytically and are extracted from numerical data .",
    "the long - range behaviors of various correlation functions are calculated straightforwardly by expressing the corresponding fermionic operators in terms of the bosons @xmath38 , @xmath39 and their duals .",
    "exponentials of the pinned bosons can be replaced by their groundstate expectation values but exponentials of the duals of pinned bosons lead to exponentially decaying factors in correlation functions .",
    "exponentials of the gapless boson , @xmath32 and its dual give power law decaying factors .",
    "for instance , to calculate the uniform part of the pair correlation function we bosonize the pair operator : @xmath40 we may replace the exponentials of @xmath30 and @xmath41 by a constant factor leaving simply the operator @xmath42 .",
    "the correlation function for this operator decays as @xmath43 .",
    "the same result is obtained for the correlation function of a pair of electrons in the odd channel , @xmath44 . on the other hand ,",
    "the correlation function @xmath45 is the same except for a factor of @xmath46 .",
    "this is expected to be @xmath47 , based on the sign of the cosine interaction which pins the @xmath30 boson to @xmath48 , so this pair correlation function has the opposite sign , corresponding to `` d - wave pairing '' . the @xmath49 part of the ( even , spin - up ) density operator is : @xmath50 the correlation function of this operator has exponential decay due to the @xmath51 factor .",
    "exponential decay is also obtained for all other terms in the @xmath49 part of the density operator . on the other hand ,",
    "if we consider the correlation function for the square of the density operator , we get power - law decay for the @xmath52 part .",
    "this arises from terms of the form : @xmath53 we may replace @xmath54 by its expectation value leaving only the gapless @xmath32 field which gives power law decay : @xmath55\\over    will pick up a @xmath52 term proportional to this and also exhibit the same type of @xmath52 power law decay .",
    "this phase with one gapless charge mode and no gapless spin modes , labeled `` c1s0 '' is expected to be the generic phase in the 2 leg @xmath0 or hubbard ladder . whether this phase is better thought of as almost a d - wave superconductor , or almost an incommensurate cdw depends on the magnitude of @xmath36 .",
    "the pairing correlation function decays less rapidly than the density correlation function in the case @xmath56 .",
    "schulz has shown@xcite that @xmath57 as the density , @xmath58 , approaches @xmath59 . at @xmath60 ,",
    "the ladder is a spin gapped mott insulator .",
    "thus it is of interest to calculate @xmath36 .",
    "this can be done from the finite size spectrum using either periodic or open boundary conditions .",
    "the latter are often used with dmrg so we discuss both cases .",
    "while , as we discuss below , it is enough to measure the excitation energies of only 3 states to extract @xmath36 ( and the velocity @xmath35 ) we give formulas for an infinite number of low lying excitations .",
    "this allows for a more extensive check of the bosonization results with dmrg . due to the somewhat conjectural nature of the extrapolation of weak coupling hubbard results to the @xmath0 model",
    "this would be a worthwhile check .",
    "we discuss only the groundstate and low - lying excitations , whose excitation energies all scale to 0 as @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the length of the system .",
    "these can be simply calculated from the free boson hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) when proper account is taken of the boundary conditions on the boson field , @xmath32 .",
    "we will generally set @xmath63 , restoring it by dimensional analysis when needed .",
    "we first consider the case of periodic boundary conditions ( b.c.s ) .",
    "clearly periodic b.c.s on the fermions translate into periodic b.c.s on the boson fields but we must take into account the fact that the boson fields are actually phase fields ( only their exponentials and derivatives occur as physical local operators ) .",
    "since all physical operators in the low energy effective theory involve integer powers of @xmath64 $ ] and @xmath65 $ ] , as in eqs .",
    "( [ pair ] ) and ( [ density ] ) , we see that : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are arbitrary integers . to obtain the complete low energy spectrum we simply write a mode expansion for the boson fields , consistent with these b.c.s and the canonical commutation relations .",
    "this gives : @xmath69 here the quantum numbers @xmath67 and @xmath68 are integer valued .",
    "( [ pi ] ) we see that the zero wave - vector mode of the conjugate momentum , @xmath70 , has eigenvalues @xmath71 .",
    "thus the wave - functions for the zero - momentum modes are @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "these wave - functions are invariant under @xmath73 , as required by the angular nature of @xmath74 .",
    "( the same result holds for the dual zero wave vector field , @xmath75 and its conjugate momentum . )",
    "the @xmath76 and @xmath77 operators annihilate left and right moving harmonic boson modes .",
    "we may give a physical interpretation to the quantum number @xmath67 using the bosonization formula for the total charge density : @xmath78 thus the total charge , relative to that of the groundstate , is : @xmath79 only excitations of even charge occur in the c1s0 phase .",
    "the other quantum number , @xmath67 , measures the `` chiral charge '' which has a less obvious physical interpretation as the difference of charges of left and right movers .    inserting eq .",
    "( [ mode ] ) into the hamiltonian of eq .",

    "@xmath84 is the groundstate energy for a given density , @xmath58 , and is non - universal .",
    "this formula gives the excitation energy for low - lying excitations with all quantum numbers @xmath85 .",
    "the parameters @xmath86 ( chemical potential ) @xmath35 and @xmath36 all depend on density .",
    "the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath35 can be determined by measuring the excitation energies of three states .",
    "generally one calculates the excitation energies of the states with @xmath87 ( and all other quantum numbers set to zero ) to determine the ratio @xmath88 , using : @xmath89 the compressibility for a 2-leg ladder is generally defined as @xmath90 where @xmath58 is the density . from eqs .",
    "( [ q ] ) and ( [ es ] ) , this has the value @xmath91 .",
    "the velocity may be measured separately from the excitation energy of the lowest state of momentum @xmath92 : @xmath93 thus measuring three excitation energies , for fixed , large @xmath62 , allows a determination of the correlation exponents .",
    "using a large @xmath62 is important because corrections to eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) are only down by additional powers of @xmath61 .",
    "these corrections become especially large at commensurate filling near a transition to a cdw .",
    "the corresponding exponent will be given in sec .",
    "iii . while these three measurements are enough to determined the critical exponents , measurements of energies of additional states and a study of the @xmath62-dependence provide additional confirmation of the predictions of the rg and bosonization .",
    "as mentioned above , dmrg works much more efficiently with open boundary conditions .",
    "we now discuss the finite size spectrum in that case .",
    "if we number the sites from 1 to l then we have a free boundary condition at @xmath94 and @xmath95 .",
    "a free boundary condition on the fermion field at @xmath94 is equivalent to a vanishing boundary condition at @xmath96 .",
    "[ this follows from adding an extra `` phantom site '' at @xmath96 with associated hopping and exchange terms but then making these terms vanish by imposing @xmath97 . ] in terms of left and right movers this free boundary condition becomes : @xmath98 upon bosonizing we obtain : @xmath99 or @xmath100 ( a determination of this constant involves consideration of some subtle commutators",
    ". we will not bother to keep track of it in what follows . )",
    "clearly this boundary condition remains the same when expressed in the eventual basis @xmath101 , @xmath102 .",
    "the only important boundary condition for the low energy excitations is : @xmath103 the same b.c .",
    "is obtained at @xmath104 except that the constant will generally be different .",
    "taking into account the periodic nature of @xmath74 , eq .",
    "( [ bc ] ) , and the fact that @xmath105 must also vanish at the boundaries , we see that the mode expansions become : @xmath106 here @xmath107 is proportional to the difference of constants appearing in the b.c.s at @xmath108 and @xmath109 . substituting into the hamiltonian",
    ", we now obtain the finite size spectrum : @xmath110.\\label{esopen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we see that eq .",
    "( [ detk ] ) for @xmath88 remains true with free b.c.s as we might expect due to the relation with the compressibility .",
    "we may now determine the velocity independently ( and hence determine @xmath36 ) by measuring the gap to the first excited state with the same charge as the groundstate : @xmath111 note that this gap has half the value of the gap to the lowest energy state of momentum @xmath92 in the case of periodic b.c.s , eq .",
    "( [ detv ] ) .",
    "this is just a consequence of the familiar result that the spacing of wave - vectors for open b.c.s is @xmath112 , half the spacing for periodic b.c.s .",
    "previous measurements of the parameter @xmath36 , and its analogue in other chain and ladder systems , have used periodic boundary conditions .",
    "exact diagonalization , or `` modified lanczos '' methods work efficiently to determined the lowest energy state of given quantum numbers .",
    "thus the energy differences of eqs .",
    "( [ detk ] ) and ( [ detv ] ) can be measured from finding the lowest energy states with various charges and with momenta @xmath113 and @xmath92 .",
    "an alternative approach is to meaure the dependence of the groundstate energy ( for a fixed charge ) on an applied flux , i.e. a twist in the boundary conditions on the fermion fields : @xmath114 this corresponds to putting a twist into the boundary condition on @xmath31 in eq .",

    "@xmath117 from eq .",
    "( [ es ] ) we see that the groundstate energy is increased by : @xmath118 hence measuring the flux dependence of the groundstate energy determines @xmath119 , while measuring the compressibility determines @xmath88 .",
    "hayward and poilblanc@xcite measured @xmath36 in this way for the 2-leg ladder using a maximum system size of @xmath120 .",
    "another approach was taken by siller et al.@xcite they modeled the 2-leg tj model as a single chain model of bosonic hole pairs .",
    "the parameters in the effective hamiltonian for hole pairs were determined from dmrg calculations with open boundary conditions on system sizes up to @xmath121 for systems containing 2 holes or 4 holes only .",
    "the resulting bosonic model was then studied using exact diagonalization ( lanczos ) methods and periodic boundary conditions . since the number of effective bosons ( of density @xmath122 where @xmath123 ) is small near 1/2-filling , it was possible to diagonalize large systems ( up to 220 sites in the case of only 2 bosons ) .",
    "the approach advocated here , working exclusively with open boundary conditions , has been used previously for spin chains@xcite but not , as far we we know , for tj ladders .",
    "it allows us , using dmrg , to study much larger system sizes , up to @xmath124 , than are accessible with lanczos in the usual formulation.@xcite it furthermore avoids making any assumptions which are necessary in treating the hole pairs as bosons , such as the particular form of the boson - boson interaction and the absence of three - boson terms , which could induce some density dependence in the interaction .",
    "however , the dmrg calculations with the accuracy and system length required to determine @xmath36 for these ladder systems were surprisingly difficult . in order to minimize the effect of correction terms to the asymptotic formulas ,",
    "long systems were needed . in these systems , one is probing competing pairing and charge fluctuations at very low energies and large distances , which is difficult in dmrg . typically more than 2000 states were kept in the calculations and more than a dozen sweeps were performed .",
    "some of the calculations were more accurate and reliable than others , however .",

    "these calculations were difficult .",
    "it is necessary to target two states simultaneously , and extrapolation is not very useful .",
    "note that , if @xmath62 is not large enough and the ( infinite @xmath62 ) spin gap is not small enough , @xmath126 , then the first excited state with the same quantum numbers might actually have @xmath127 , @xmath128 and correspond to a spin excitation , rather than the desired neutral excitation of the @xmath129 field .",
    "( it might also be a neutral excitation of one of the other gapped boson fields . ) in order to check the former possibility , we have calculated the spin gap , i.e. the excitation energy for the lowest state with @xmath130 .",

    "[ figcgall ] is due to a small spin gap in this system , of order 0.04 .",

    "the @xmath52 oscillations clearly dominate although a small @xmath49 part is observed . at larger @xmath138 ,",
    "the oscillations at @xmath49 are larger than those at @xmath52 .",
    "thus we expect @xmath145 models to exhibit generic friedel oscillations in all cases except for the special case of a single leg in the limit @xmath303 where the absence of spin rearrangement processes eliminates the lowest wave - vector component of the oscillations .",
    "the friedel oscillation wave - vector can be a useful diagnostic of which phase a particular multi - leg @xmath145 model is in .",
    "for instance , the minimum oscillation wave - vector , @xmath304 , is a characteristic of the particular c1s0 phase of the 2 leg ladder reviewed in sec .",
    "ii ( in which the @xmath29 and @xmath30 fields are pinned ) .",
    "other phases exhibit other oscillation wave - vectors .",
    "we expect such an analysis of dmrg results to be useful in determining the phase diagram of multi - leg ladders .",
