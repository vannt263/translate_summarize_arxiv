    "the very accurate measurement of the neutron spin - dependent structure function @xmath5 @xcite , whose results have been presented recently , possess two remarkable properties .",
    "first , the values of neutron structure function at @xmath6 are rather large and negative in the region of moderately low @xmath0 .",
    "second , the data can be rather accurately fitted by the power function @xmath7 and this power seems to be unexpectedly large .",
    "it is not obvious , where this large number , for which there is no indication in the proton data , is coming from , so it may affect the extrapolation to @xmath8 and cast some doubts on the validity of bjorken sum rule .    in the present paper",
    "we perform the isospin decomposition of the data for both proton and neutron . as a result",
    ", we conclude that the isovector contribution is well approximated by the power behaviour found earlier by an elaborate method based on nlo evolution @xcite .",
    "it may be interpreted either as the manifestation of @xmath9 terms @xcite or as the contribution of the regge cut , produced by the @xmath4 meson and a bfkl pomeron which has a high intercept . at the same time , for the isoscalar part one has the signature for a rather singular singlet contribution , compatible with the similar behaviour predicted by qcd @xcite , although statistical errors are still rather large .",
    "this may imply a significant gluon polarization in the nucleon in this range of @xmath0 , which could also clearly show up in double helicity asymmetries @xmath10 at rhic , if they turn out to be larger than estimated earlier@xcite .",
    "the main feature of the new neutron data @xcite is large and negative @xmath11 , measured with a good accuracy up to small @xmath0 , say @xmath12 .",
    "the slac proton data @xcite at @xmath13 are positive and of roughly the same magnitude , but on the contrary , rather flat in this region .",
    "this could be understood , qualitatively , as a result of the interplay of a negative contribution at low @xmath0 , responsible for the singular behaviour of the neutron , and a positive contribution at larger @xmath0 . to check this assumption",
    "it is instructive to consider the isovector contribution . since there is no clear evidence of scaling violations between @xmath13 and @xmath14 in any polarized deep inelastic scattering experiment , we may neglect , for the time being , the effects of qcd evolution , because we are only interested in the results , provided by the data at the present level of statistical accuracy .",
    "it is then possible , by combining the slac neutron data with the slac proton data , to determine the quantity @xmath15 , entering the bjorken sum rule , with a higher accuracy , than for proton alone .",
    "this is because the neutron data are fortunately negative , so the difference is larger in magnitude than @xmath16 , while the errors are practically the same for @xmath17 and @xmath16 , given the better accuracy of the neutron data .",
    "performing this analysis of the data , we see immediately a behaviour less sharp than that of neutron . since phase space effects , as powers of @xmath18 , are not so important in the region under consideration , we were looking for a simple power parametrization of the data , implied by regge pole behaviour , namely    @xmath19    and we found that this works rather well , for @xmath20 with the following choice of parameters :    @xmath21    as shown in fig.1 .",
    "the power we obtain is significantly smaller than the expected contribution of the @xmath22 meson trajectory @xmath23 . as a result ,",
    "the contribution to the bjorken integral from the region @xmath24 is large    @xmath25    the region of higher @xmath0 corresponds to a neutron contribution much smaller than that of the proton , the latter also providing a large contribution to the integral , and we have    @xmath26    the total contribution to the bjorken sum rule ,    @xmath27    appears to be in the fair agreement with the theoretical value .",
    "note that when the final neutron data will be available , as well as more precise proton data , it will allow one a more serious analysis , taking also into account the effects of qcd evolution .    at the present moment we would like to stress , that by combining the current neutron and proton data , one is led to good agreement with bjorken sum rule .",
    "let us stress that this power is compatible with the one obtained using next - to - leading order ( nlo ) fit @xcite to all previous data @xmath28 .",
    "it is consistent with the result of @xmath9 summation @xcite .",
    "we may also understand the observed power @xmath29 by considering the intercept of the regge cut associated to the @xmath4 meson and a pomeron , namely @xmath30 provided we use the famous bfkl pomeron @xcite with the intercept @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "since we found , that the sharp neutron structure function is not seen in the difference between proton and neutron , it should be attributed to the isoscalar channel . also , the partial cancellation",
    ", we suspect to be at the origin of a flat proton structure function , should be manifested in this channel as well . to check this",
    ", we calculated the quantity @xmath33 .",
    "it really shows a rather flat structure for @xmath34 .",
    "the relative errors are much larger in this case because @xmath35 is small due to the fact that @xmath16 and @xmath5 have opposite signs .",
    "of course this fact also implies a small value of the deuteron structure function in this kinematic region , which is barely consistent with the existing data @xcite .",
    "this flat structure should be related to the interplay of the negative sharp contribution , showing itself in the fit @xmath7 to the neutron data @xcite , and a positive contribution with a smaller power , dominating at larger @xmath0 . since there is no counterpart for such a sharp behaviour in the conventional regge analysis",
    ", we make a strong , but natural assumption .",
    "namely , we suggest that it is manifested in the @xmath36-singlet channel .",
    "it is in this channel that a strong mixing between polarized quarks and gluons provides the anomalous gluon contribution to the first moment of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "recent studies show that generalized anomalous gluon contribution appears also in all moments@xcite . at low @xmath0",
    "the quark - gluon mixing provides a strong correction to the subleading behaviour @xcite , producing a power close to 1 .",
    "one might expect that a similar effect is also present in the non - perturbative region where it can give rise to a strong @xmath0 dependence in gluon distribution at low @xmath38 , which is an initial condition in the approach just mentioned above .",
    "an example of such a non - perturbative contribution is given by instanton effects@xcite which , however , do not provide yet a reliable quantitative estimate .",
    "moreover , the @xmath36- nonsinglet part receives the contributions from the @xmath39- and @xmath40-mesons trajectories .",
    "the first one has an intercept close to that of @xmath4 occurring in the isovector channel , while the second one produces a smoother behaviour like @xmath41 .",
    "for the first estimate we neglect the latter and find that the data are well described by the formula :    @xmath42    as seen in fig.2 .",
    "this formula is suggesting that the isoscalar contribution is approximately equal to the isovector one , which is not so surprising , in order to have the neutron structure function , dominated by the most singular power only .",
    "this would mean , that in this region of @xmath0 , say between 0.01 and 0.1 , one has    @xmath43    requiring a strong negative @xmath44-quark polarization .",
    "apart from the difficulties of incorporating this result to current models of nucleon structure , it could also conflict with the bjorken sum rule for the decay of strange baryons , implying that the integrals of both sides of this equation should be of opposite signs .",
    "although the suggested above equality may be valid only in a limited region of @xmath0 , and violations of @xmath36 symmetry may be possible , it is more likely , that the @xmath45 contribution makes the @xmath0 dependence of isovector and isoscalar combinations , different in the region under consideration , so we will have    @xmath46    the numerical analysis shows , that the present inaccurate data , mainly for @xmath47 are equally well described with a wide range of coefficients @xmath48 and @xmath49 . bearing in mind the problem with the second bjorken sum rule mentioned above , one may suspect a negative value for @xmath49 in order to reduce the isoscalar integral at larger values of @xmath0 . on the other hand ,",
    "the parameters of the singlet contribution are rather stable , @xmath50 , which is again related to the good accuracy of neutron data .",
    "note that , if this neutron behaviour is really an isoscalar phenomenon , as suggested by our analysis , one should observe a decrease and sign change for the proton structure function not too far from @xmath51 at low @xmath38 .",
    "this is the first major check of this result .",
    "however , negative proton structure function for much smaller values of @xmath0 and low @xmath38 have been considered in the literature and a sign change may also come at large @xmath38 from the effect of qcd evolution @xcite .",
    "note that the obtained power is also compatible with the nlo fit @xcite result , but the accuracy of the neutron data would allow to reduce the error .",
    "it is , of course , too early to relate unambiguously the observed behaviour to the results of @xcite , because of the limited experimental accuracy and some theoretical problems . in particular , it is not absolutely clear , to what values of @xmath0 and @xmath38 the results of @xcite should be applicable .",
    "nethertheless , the relative closeness of the experimental and theoretical numbers may be a signal , that the low @xmath0 asymptotic behaviour is manifested rather early , especially in the neutron case , where it is not screened by a large nonsinglet contribution , like in the proton case .",
    "note that clear evidence for negative @xmath5 no longer requires the negative gluon polarization , as was guessed in @xcite , relying on earlier data .",
    "moreover , we found that the formula ( 3.24 ) of @xcite is not incompatible with the data , if some mean values ( like suggested in @xcite ) of parton distributions are taken as an input .",
    "however , this approach does not allow one to extract the @xmath0-dependent parton distribution , and we shall use now the continuity with the region of average @xmath0 in order to get an estimate .",
    "it is not clear , to which extent one should attribute a small @xmath0 singlet contribution to quarks or to gluons .",
    "however , according to @xcite the contribution of gluons is dominant , so we neglect the quark contribution in the present approach . requiring the qualitative continuity in transition between low and average @xmath0 , and applying the parton - like formula for the anomalous gluon contribution it seems natural to expect that the gluon distribution is behaving like    @xmath52    note , that this formula is assuming the simple relation between singlet contribution to @xmath37 and @xmath53 at average @xmath0 @xmath54 which is , strictly speaking , is valid for the first moment only . more generally , one has @xcite",
    "@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the coefficient function , describing the gluon - photon interaction .",
    "recent studies , based on the non - local generalization of the axial anomaly@xcite , support the following choice @xcite @xmath57 leading , for the gluon distribution of the type @xmath58 , to the relation @xmath59    as a result , for @xmath60 , @xmath61 should be multiplied , for a given @xmath62 , by a factor @xmath63 and the integral of @xmath61 in the range @xmath1 is about 1 .",
    "the double helicity asymmetry @xmath10 in prompt photon production in @xmath64 collisions is directly related to @xmath61 and for the center of mass energy @xmath65 , which will be reached at rhic , one is probing precisely this kinematic region of @xmath0 .",
    "so given such a strong gluon polarization , we anticipate a larger @xmath10 than previously predicted @xcite .",
    "similar comments can be made for @xmath10 in inclusive jet production .",
    "we have performed here an analysis based on the present level of the experimental accuracy , still not enough to see the effects of qcd evolution , but providing interesting information about isospin structure .",
    "for this reason we restrict ourself to the slac data , and neglect the effects of qcd evolution in our analysis .",
    "note that the smc data @xcite are unfortunately not accurate enough to be used for such a simple isospin decomposition .",
    "the results on @xmath66 are certainly not incompatible with our @xmath35 but in order to obtain @xmath17 , it is necessary to extract @xmath5 from @xmath66 after subtracting @xmath16 , which enhances substantially the statistical errors .",
    "however , the elaborate statistical analysis using nlo evolution lead to the very similar powers , although the error for the singlet case is still very large .",
    "\\ii ) from our simultaneous analysis of proton and neutron data , there is no indication of such a behaviour in @xmath17 . instead",
    ", it is well described by the @xmath68 , which leads to a good saturation of bjorken sum rule .",
    "consequently , the existence of a strong negative isoscalar contribution is implied by these two facts .",
    "it seems rather well established , and leads to predict a negative @xmath16 for @xmath0 below @xmath69 .",
    "both the interpretation of the nonsinglet behaviour as a @xmath9 terms ( or cut produced by the bfkl pomeron ) , as well as the relation of the sharp behaviour of the singlet contribution at low @xmath0 , and even further , to a strong gluon polarization , can be considered more speculative .",
    "it would be an unusual coincidence , that two rather different aspects of small-@xmath0 physics manifest themselves in the same physical quantity . however , these assumptions seem to us possible , and they will be either supported or disproved by future more accurate data which will allow to elaborate a better analysis of the problem .",
