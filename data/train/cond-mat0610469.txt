    "amorphous or glassy materials differ significantly from crystals , especially in the low temperature range , where , for 3d bulks , @xmath26 and @xmath20.@xcite these temperature dependences were explained by the presence of specific dynamic defects .",
    "these defects are modeled by an ensemble of so - called _ two level systems _ ( tls ) that exists in the material.@xcite a tls can be understood as an atom , or a group of atoms , which can tunnel between two close minima in configuration space , forming a hybridized doublet state .",

    "<S> it can , however , be extracted from the amplitude of the temperature oscillations in ac measurements and it appears also to be proportional to @xmath15 , where @xmath16 lies roughly between 1 and 2.@xcite    the temperature dependence of @xmath10 and @xmath17 in mesoscopic membranes and bridges can partly be explained by a crossover from a three - dimensional to a two - dimensional phonon gas distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this crossover takes place when the dominant thermal phonon wavelength , @xmath18 , is comparable to the membrane thickness .    </S>",
    "<S> because of the finite thickness , there are gaps in the phonon spectra , the phonon dispersion relations near the band edges being nonlinear . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the specific heat deviates from the law @xmath19 , which one would intuitively expect from a two - dimensional phonon gas . </S>",
    "<S> instead , one obtains for very low temperatures @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    to study the heat conductivity in mesoscopic insulators , bridges have been cut out of the above mentioned membranes . there , a decrease of the exponent of the temperature dependence of @xmath10 from @xmath21 to about @xmath22 was observed . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the cut - off frequency of the temperature oscillations in ac heating measurements ( @xmath23 ) was observed to increase with temperature for the narrowest bridges.@xcite taking into account the fact that the edges of the bridges are very rough due to the cutting process , the measured data could be explained by using the dispersion relations of the above mentioned lamb modes to calculate heat capacity and heat conductivity.@xcite    nevertheless , in some experiments the same behavior , @xmath24 with @xmath16 being roughly 2,@xcite and the increase of @xmath25 with the temperature @xcite was observed also above the 2d3d crossover temperature . </S>",
    "<S> to explain these features we have to extend our model and take into account the amorphous structure of the material  low stress amorphous silicon nitride  used in the above mentioned experiments . </S>"
