    "ly@xmath1 emitters ( laes ) can be a probe of cosmic reionization , since their ly@xmath1 emission is absorbed or scattered by neutral hydrogen if the universe is not completely ionized , causing ly@xmath1 luminosity function ( lf ) to decline as the fraction of neutral hydrogen in intergalactic medium ( igm ) increases @xcite . from @xmath11 to 5.7 ,",
    "the ly@xmath1 lf was observed not to evolve ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . also , many authors constructed statistically large and uniform samples of @xmath12 and 6.6 laes with some candidates spectroscopically confirmed @xcite .",
    "they found that the ly@xmath1 lf significantly declines from @xmath12 to 6.6 , suggesting that the universe could be partly neutral at @xmath13 .",
    "the decline of the lf was further supported with large spectroscopic samples newly obtained by independent observations of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite found that ly@xmath1 lf also declines from @xmath126.6 to 7 .",
    "these studies all imply that neutral fraction might increase with redshift at @xmath14 .",
    "moreover , @xcite noticed that average ly@xmath1 equivalent width ( ew ) is slightly smaller at @xmath13 than 5.7 .",
    "@xcite also found that ly@xmath1 ew distributions of @xmath155.7 laes are similar , but ews of @xmath13 laes are smaller . on the other hand , some lyman break galaxies ( lbgs )",
    "are known to show strong ly@xmath1 emission , while some do not .",
    "fraction of ly@xmath1 emitting lbgs increases from @xmath16 to 6 @xcite but suddenly drops from @xmath10 to 7 @xcite .",
    "the lower ew and ly@xmath1 lbg fraction at @xmath14 could be due to the rapid evolution of neutral fraction from @xmath10 to 7 .",
    "this is consistent with the idea of the partly neutral universe suggested by the decline of the ly@xmath1 lf .",
    "however , some authors found a fair number of @xmath5 and 7.7 lae candidates and claim that the ly@xmath1 lf does not evolve from @xmath126.6 to 77.7 @xcite .",

    "if they suffer some contaminations , the conclusion would be different . the best way to reveal",
    "this is to identify all the candidates by spectroscopy .",
    "however , this requires very expensive campaigns that observe many candidates spread over different sky locations with sufficiently long integration to ensure detections or non - detections of ly@xmath1 . alternatively , simpler but indirect method is to conduct one imaging and spectroscopy survey and compare its _ contamination free _ result with the photometric lfs .    here",

    "since no detailed information about @xmath21 galaxies was available in 2003 , we selected lae candidates with tentative color criteria and conducted spectroscopy of them . in this paper , we re - analyze the nb980 data , refine the color criteria based on recent knowledge of @xmath0 galaxies , select @xmath57.1 lae candidates and see if their spectra were taken in 2003 to derive a contamination - free result .    in section 2 ,",

    "we applied the criteria ( 1)(4 ) to the nb980-detected object catalogs .",
    "then , we visually inspected the nb980 images of selected objects to remove obviously spurious ones such as tails of saturated pixels from bright stars , halos of bright stars , noises of anomalously high fluxes at the edges of ccds and field of view , and residual of fringing . as a result , one object in ms1520 remained ( hereafter ms1520-a ) .",

    "hence , their criteria select @xmath160 laes / lbgs .",
    "meanwhile , @xcite used even more inclusive criterion @xmath161 , which selects @xmath162 laes / lbgs , and they did not have nb921 images to avoid @xmath1596.6 laes . their sample include 4 and 6 candidates with @xmath1631.5 in the d33 and the d41 fields",
    ". some of them might be @xmath1596.6 laes , which @xcite did not select .",
    "in fact , @xcite reported that if they did not impose null detection in nb921 , they selected a spectroscopically confirmed @xmath13 lae iok-3 with @xmath164 as a candidate . besides , @xcite adopted @xmath165 without examining redshift evolution of this color of laes .",
    "for the same reason as the case of nb973 , @xcite sample might potentially include some lower redshift laes / lbgs . if @xcite candidates really include some such contaminations , their real @xmath5 ly@xmath1 lfs after corrected for the contaminations could show evolution from @xmath10 and predict more consistent number of laes in our nb980 survey .      in table",
    "[ explaenum ] , we also listed the expected number of laes in our survey estimated using 3 @xmath6 ly@xmath1 lfs @xcite under the assumption that lf does not evolve from @xmath5 to 7.7 .",
    "all the expected numbers are consistent with null detection within errors . nonetheless , the average value 0.70.8 of the expected number ( @xmath121@xmath122 laes ) estimated from the lfs of @xcite and @xcite is close to a single detection that means evolution of lf from @xmath5 to 7.7 . actually , these authors and even @xcite claim that if their candidates are all real @xmath6 laes , their lfs imply a trend opposite to the decline of ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath12 to 6.6 and 7 found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite also performed monte carlo simulations to estimate the expected number of laes in their surveys and concluded that even if 1 or 2 candidates in their samples are real @xmath6 laes , it implies no evolution of ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath159 to 7.7 .",
    "there are two possible scenarios that explain the situation .",
    "one is that @xmath6 laes might be somehow brighter than @xmath159 laes in ly@xmath1 luminosity . in this case , @xmath6 lf is observed to be similar to or higher than @xmath159 lf even if attenuated by neutral hydrogen .",
    "there are two factors potentially supporting this .",
    "first , stellar population studies of @xmath10 massive ( @xmath166 ) lbgs suggest that they could have had substantially high star formation rates in the past at @xmath218 to assemble their high masses and could be very bright at @xmath0 @xcite . also , narrowband selected laes tend to be the lower mass and younger age extension of lbg population and might be at the earlier stage of the evolution of lbgs @xcite",
    ". if @xmath6 laes are the progenitors of @xmath10 massive lbgs , they might be intrinsically very bright .",
    "second , @xcite estimated ly@xmath1 escape fractions @xmath167 at @xmath1687.7 using observed data in literatures and found that @xmath167 increases with redshift when they fitted a power law to @xmath167 s at @xmath1686 .",
    "if @xmath167 is higher in laes at @xmath6 than 6.5 , @xmath6 laes are observed to be brighter .",
    "another scenario is that all the lae candidates of @xcite and @xcite and all / some of @xcite lae candidates are not @xmath6 laes .",
    "this agrees with the decline of ly@xmath1 lf from @xmath12 to 6.67 found by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported by another @xmath6 lae survey by @xcite who did not detect any candidates . as mentioned earlier , the drop in fraction of ly@xmath1 emitting lbgs at @xmath14 @xcite",
    "could be also a support .",
    "we conducted the subaru focas nb980 imaging and spectroscopy survey of @xmath57.1 laes in the sdf and ms1520 and detected no laes to a @xmath32 ly@xmath1 flux limit of @xmath169 erg s@xmath44 @xmath51 in a comoving volume of @xmath58 mpc@xmath59 .",
    "we estimated the expected number of laes in our survey from 5 @xmath5 and 3 @xmath6 photometric ly@xmath1 lfs .",
    "seven agree with null detection within errors but average lae numbers predicted by one @xmath5 and two @xmath6 lfs among the seven indicate nearly a single detection .",
    "the remaining one @xmath5 lf predicts a detection of @xmath9 laes . for @xmath5 ,",
    "the discrepancy likely comes from different lae selection criteria . for @xmath6",
    ", there are 2 possibilities .",
    "( 1 ) if @xmath6 laes are brighter than lower-@xmath102 laes , @xmath6 lf is similar to or higher than lower-@xmath102 lfs even if attenuated by neutral hydrogen . ( 2 ) if all the @xmath6 candidates are not real , ly@xmath1 lf declines from @xmath10 to 7.7 .",
    "evaluation of @xmath0 ly@xmath1 lfs in this study relies on an indirect method .",
    "the direct and best way is secure spectroscopy of all the candidates .",
    "future powerful telescopes such as jwst or tmt will facilitate this and reveal the real nature of ly@xmath1 lfs at the epoch of reionization .",
    "this work is based on data collected at the subaru telescope , which is operated by the national astronomical observatory of japan .",
