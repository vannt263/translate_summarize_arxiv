    "understanding how ` non - fermi - liquid ' behavior arises near the half - filled insulating state is one of the key questions for unraveling the physics of not only the cuprates but that of correlated electron systems more generally .",
    "here we show how some aspects of the electronic spectrum which are difficult to understand in a conventional fermi liquid theory can be explained naturally in a model of an antiferromagnetic fermi liquid .",
    "specifically , it has been reported that the renormalization of the electronic dispersion decreases with underdoping as half - filling is approached,@xcite i.e. the quasiparticles ( qps ) seem to ` undress ' in the underdoped regime . in sharp contrast",
    ", the spectral weight of the qps fades away on approaching the insulator and renormalizes to zero at half - filling@xcite , indicating that these qps are very fragile or ` gossamer'-like@xcite . within fermi liquid theory",
    "the qp dispersion and spectral weight should be renormalized by the same factor , unless the self - energy has a strong momentum dependence .",
    "however , fluctuations in the cuprates seem to be relatively isotropic@xcite , which would imply then that the renormalization factor @xmath0 for dispersion is roughly equal to the renormalization factor @xmath1 for the spectral weight .",
    "this is clearly violated near the mott insulating limit , where @xmath2 while @xmath3 .",
    "added to these puzzling findings is the fact that the electronic specific heat continues to behave more or less in a fermi - liquid manner over the entire doping range from the overdoped metal to the insulator@xcite .",
    "these results clearly demonstrate that a non - fermi - liquid or ` strange metal ' superconductor emerges from the fermi - liquid background as doping is reduced .",
    "notably , there is considerable controversy over what constitutes non - fermi - liquid behavior and many proposals have been made to understand its possible origin , ranging from preformed @xmath4wave pairs@xcite to fluctuating spin - density waves@xcite , from the hubbard@xcite and @xmath5@xcite models to the anti - de sitter / conformal field theory ( ads - cft ) correspondence@xcite .",
    "insight into the origin of non - fermi - liquid behavior comes from recent angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes)@xcite , hall effect@xcite , and quantum oscillation@xcite experiments , which reveal the presence of fs reconstruction as a robust feature of both electron and hole doped cuprates , suggesting that the ground state involves some superlattice order . in this article",
    ", we investigate a model of the underdoped cuprates with a density wave ordered ground state and find that when the fermi surface ( fs ) breaks into pockets , the self - energy develops a strong momentum dependence .",
    "analytic forms for various renormalization factors are presented to delineate how the non - fermi - liquid physics arising from fs reconstructions can be understood at a quantitative level .",
    "our study thus provides a tangible model for reconciling the seemingly contradictory doping evolutions of the qp dispersion , the qp spectral weight and the specific heat in the cuprates .",
    "the possibility of fs reconstruction in the cuprates has been proposed many times since it was found that the hall density scales with doping@xcite  i.e. , it is proportional to the small pocket area rather than the large fs .",
    "we model this fs reconstruction by assuming a spin density wave ( sdw ) order which results in a nearly - antiferromagnetic - fermi - liquid ( nafl ) phase@xcite .",
    "in addition to sdw order , we have analyzed other candidates for the competing order including charge , flux , or @xmath4density waves@xcite and find that the pseudogap symmetry which is the essential ingredient for the origin of non - fermi - liquid physics is insensitive to the particular nature of the competing order state .",
    "we calculate the self - energy due to spin and charge fluctuations within a qp - gw formalism described in appendix a. the model is known to properly describe the high - energy waterfall features in arpes@xcite as well as the doping evolution of the optical spectra and the finite qp lifetime.@xcite within the qp - gw model the self - energy splits the spectrum into coherent in - gap states and an incoherent residue of the undoped upper and lower hubbard bands ( u / lhbs ) .",
    "with underdoping , the _ in - gap states _ develop an sdw gap and split into upper and lower magnetic bands ( u / lmbs)@xcite , and the resulting ` four - band ' features are consistent with quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) calculations@xcite [ appendix a ] .",
    "the involvement of a quantum critical point ( qcp ) in the optimal doping regime where the sdw order disappears is strongly suggestive of an intermediate strength for correlations in the cuprates.@xcite accordingly , there have been several recent attempts to develop an intermediate coupling model for the cuprates starting from either the weak - coupling limit , as in the present calculation , or the strong - coupling limit@xcite .",
    "therefore , we compare our results with experiments as well as with the variational cluster calculations of paramekanti , randeria and trevedi ( prt)@xcite , which approach the problem from the rvb limit .    this article is organized as follows . in sections",
    "iia and iib , we investigate the doping evolution of the spectral weight and that of dispersion renormalization , respectively .",
    "the specific heat results are presented in section iii .",
    "the discussion and conclusions are given in sections iv and v respectively .",
    "a summary of the underlying qp - gw model is provided in appendix a. various renormalization factors invoked are summarized in appendix b for the reader s convenience .",
    "appendices c and d address details of analytic forms for the renormalization factors and those of our specific heat evaluation .",
    "we evaluate the exact values of the renormalization factors from fs discontinuities of spectral function moments @xmath6 of various order @xmath7 , @xmath8 these moments provide important information about the spectral weight distribution in energy and momentum space as a function of doping.@xcite the spectral density @xmath9 involves both the coherent qp and the incoherent part .",
    "due to the fermi function @xmath10 , the moments @xmath11 display singularities at the fermi momentum @xmath12 which are characteristic of coherent _ gapless _ quasiparticle excitations .",
    "we consider first the zeroth order moment which is simply the momentum density @xmath13.@xcite the interacting fs is determined from the jump in @xmath14 at @xmath12 of the quasiparticles .",

    "a general expression for the specific heat @xmath56 in the sdw state including the self - energy correction is given in appendix d. we find that the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath57 can be well described in terms of the density of state ( dos ) ( @xmath58 ) in the sdw state as@xcite , @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the mean - field dos with sdw gap but without self energy corrections .",

    "the striking differences between ncco and lsco away from half - filling are due to the presence of the van - hove singularity ( vhs ) near @xmath21 in the latter case .",
    "@xmath58 in lda thus decreases ( from a finite value at @xmath25 ) with increasing electron doping , whereas for lsco @xmath58 has a peak at the doping corresponding to the vhs @xmath62@xcite .",

    "remarkably , the same model when applied to hole - doped cuprates describes many aspects of the two - gap scenario@xcite , despite the fact that it does not capture the incommensurate magnetization .",

    "should properly be treated as a tensor . however , the pseudogap phase is more likely to be associated with only short range order , in which case the second pole does not cross the real axis , the green s function can be treated as a scalar , and _ the information about incipient gap formation is encoded in the self - energy_.@xcite the analytic approximations of eqs .",
    "4 and 8 mimic this effect by treating the renormalization factors as acting on the paramagnetic dispersion @xmath79 , with information on proximity to long - range magnetic order encoded into @xmath38 and @xmath80 .",
    "this approach is similar to the phenomenological model introduced by yang et al.@xcite to describe rvb physics .",
    "indeed , their phenomenological self energy is quite similar to the form expected for a nafl , except for the treatment of scattering at the magnetic zone boundary , which splits the pockets expected for af order into two half - pockets .",
    "one puzzle is that the effect of strong scattering at a superlattice zone boundary is already well understood in standard lifshitz - kosevich theory@xcite , where it leads to a quantum switching between arcs of fermi surface .",
    "this produces harmonic mixing frequencies in a quantum oscillation ( qo ) spectrum , and it is hard to see how it could evolve into the short - circuiting effect of yang , et al . at any rate , the qos observed in ncco are more consistent with the present model.@xcite",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a number of salient features of the non - fermi - liquid state of the underdoped cuprates can be understood within the framework of a competing density wave order , which breaks the particle - hole symmetry , and drives reconstruction of the fs .",
    "we provide a transparent and analytic basis for describing how the non - fermi - liquid effects play out in renormalizing spectral weight via @xmath1 and electronic dispersion via @xmath0 , and how they conspire to yield a specific heat in the cuprates which is essentially conventional in nature at all dopings . our framework would provide a straightforward basis for understanding how the broken - symmetry order leads to ` non - fermi - liquid ' effects , not only in the cuprates , but also in heavy - fermions@xcite , fe - based superconductors@xcite and other strongly correlated materials .",
