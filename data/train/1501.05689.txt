    "it is common belief that , having a shallow potential well , low mass galaxies have an evolution which is more driven by the large - scale environment than by merging events .",
    "dwarf galaxies exhibit a strong morphological segregation : the most evolved / oldest dwarf galaxies , i.e dwarf spheroidal ( dsph ) or dwarf early - type ( de ) , are found in the group and cluster environments @xcite , while dwarfs with on - going star - formation activity , such as blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds , @xcite ) are mainly found in less dense environments .",
    "however , how precisely the environment contributes to the transformation of star - forming dwarfs to anemic des is still a puzzle as several processes may play a role @xcite .",
    "besides , the mechanism that triggers the burst of star - formation in dwarf galaxies , particularly in bcds , also remains a mystery .",
    "mergers , fly - by encounters or gas turbulence have been proposed @xcite .",

    "the emission line fluxes were measured after subtracting the stellar absorption features using the publicly available code gandlf @xcite and the stellar templates of @xcite .",
    "the extinction coefficient , e(b - v ) , derived from the balmer decrement h@xmath15/h@xmath16 is nearly equal to zero for ugc  6741 and even below the standard value of 2.86 for ugc  6741_b .",
    "this may indicate a poor subtraction of the absorption at h@xmath16 due to the low signal to noise ratio .",
    "the h@xmath15 equivalent widths  7.1  and 8.7  for ugc  6741 and ugc  6741_b respectively  are relatively small compared to the typical bcd s h@xmath15 equivalent widths @xcite .",
    "oxygen abundances , 12+log(o / h ) , were estimated with the two methods described , among others , by @xcite , i.e the so  called n2 and o3n2 methods .",
    "the n2 method only considers the line ratio between h@xmath15 and [ nii ] while the o3n2 method uses a combination of the line ratios h@xmath15/[nii ] and [ oiii]/h@xmath16 .",
    "we obtained 12+log(o / h ) = 8.3(8.3 ) and 8.3(8.2 ) dex from the n2(o3n2 ) method for ugc  6741 and ugc  6741_b , respectively .",

    "we have presented a case of a dwarf - dwarf merger in a group environment .",
    "remarkably our multi - wavelength study , based on imaging and spectroscopy , could be carried out with data solely acquired from publicly available archives .",
    "ugc  6741 is noteworthy for the presence of a tidal bridge hosting knots of star - formation , and in that respect resembles systems involving massive colliding galaxies , such as arp  104 @xcite or arp  188 ( ugc  10214 ) , also known as the tadpole galaxy .",
    "a comparison between these systems is made in figure  [ comp ] .",
    "like ugc  6741 , arp  104 exhibits a prominent tidal bridge , with hints that part of the tidal material wraps around one of the interacting galaxies ( ngc  5218 , to the north ) . for this system",
    "however , there is no evidence for the presence of star  forming regions along the bridge .    like in ugc  6741 , the long single tail that emanates from arp  188 hosts multiple compact knots of star formation .",
    "some of its young massive star cluster are as massive as @xmath2@xmath17 m@xmath18 @xcite and were most likely formed in situ in the tail out of gaseous material expelled from ugc 10214 during a dynamical interaction with a hidden or already destroyed companion .    given its shape , the stellar filament of the system studied here is undoubtedly of tidal origin .",
    "is it however as for arp  104 a bridge connecting two interacting galaxies , namely ugc  6741 and ugc  6741_b , or a single tail like in arp  188 , with ugc  6741_b being a tidal dwarf galaxy instead of a pre - existing object ?",
    "interestingly , the gas phase metallicity derived from the sdss archival spectra reveals within the errors no difference in oxygen abundance between ugc  6741 and ugc  6741_b although the latter is three times less massive .",
    "the mass - metallicity relation would predict an abundance of about 0.2 dex lower .",
    "similar metallicities between the parent galaxy and its tidal dwarf are instead expected as the latter is made from material pre - enriched in the former @xcite .",
    "this may in principle argue in favor of the tdg hypothesis for ugc  6741_b .",
    "this is however without taking into account the rather large intrinsic scatter of the m - z relation of 0.2 dex and of the systematic uncertainty in the abundance determination of the same order .",
    "besides , the existence of a prominent stellar continuum ( see fig .  [ spec ] ) suggests that the object has a significant fraction of old stellar populations and the presence of strong balmer absorption lines is a signature of star - formation over an extended period of time .",
    "the tdgs so far discovered are rather characterized by the overall dominance of young stars and of an on - going instantaneous starburst .",
    "this suggests that ugc  6741_b is a pre - existing dwarf , which is interacting with ugc  6741 .",
    "therefore , the system would in fact be rather a scale down version of arp  104 , with an overall luminosity @xmath24 mag fainter .",
    "evidence of in situ star - formation occurring in gas rich collisional debris has been reported in numerous massive interacting galaxies , including the tadpole galaxy discussed above .",
    "such regions are believed to be also a nursery of super star clusters ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "idealized numerical simulations of mergers reproduce the formation of massive and compact super star - clusters in tidal tails @xcite and predict they might be the progenitors of globular clusters , provided they survive internal feedback and external tidal shear .",
    "the most massive and extended of them may become independent tidal dwarf galaxies .",
    "the same phenomena seems to also apply to dwarf - dwarf major mergers .",
    "the bridge of ugc  6741 hosts at at least four distinct knots of star - formation .",
    "they are as massive as @xmath210@xmath3 m@xmath4 ; with stellar mass density reaching @xmath210@xmath19 m@xmath18 kpc@xmath9 , they could evolve into globular clusters or even ultra compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "their parent galaxies being low - mass systems with shallow potential well , one may speculate that they will survive longer than in the environment of systems involving massive merging galaxies .",
    "@xcite show that the statistical probability of merger of galaxies decreases towards the low mass regime .",
    "our study of ugc  6741 , however , proves that dwarf - dwarf tidal interactions and mergers occur in the nearby universe .",
    "how frequent are they ? on the one hand , exploring the millennium cosmological simulation , @xcite found that binary mergers in isolation are very rare , and claimed that satellite - satellite mergers should play a higher role than so far anticipated . on the other hand , @xcite used the constrained local universe simulation ( clues ) to conclude that interactions between satellites are unlikely . in a group environment , mergers between sub - haloes are predicted to occur only before they entered the host halo .",
    "interestingly , ugc  6741 is itself located in the very outskirts of a group .    in the real universe ,",
    "reported cases of possible dwarf - dwarf mergers have increased recently ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . distorted hi morphologies and the presence of gaseous tails around",
    "starbursting dwarf galaxies have also been attributed to mergers ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , direct evidence for an on - going tidal interaction between objects of roughly similar masses remains rare .",
    "@xcite found that the nearby magellanic irregular galaxy ngc  4449 makes a pair with a tidally disrupted dwarf galaxy .",
    "this interaction will lead to a 1:50 merger , whereas ugc  6741 corresponds to a 1:3 merger . in the world of massive galaxies , this would be considered as a major merger .",
    "several physical properties of ugc  6741 , i.e. color , metal content and star - formation rate , are fairly similar to typical blue compact dwarf galaxies and there is little doubt that its star formation activity is affected , if not triggered , by the interaction .",
    "once the burst is terminated and the galaxies have merged , which type of dwarfs will ugc  6741 resemble ?",
    "its position on the scaling relations between structural parameters can give clues on its future evolution .      )",
    "vs m@xmath0 ( top panel ) and surface brightness vs luminosity , @xmath20 vs m@xmath0 ( bottom panel ) are shown for a sample des ( gray dots , from @xcite ) and bcds ( blue dots , from @xcite ) .",
    "ugc  6741 is shown with the black solid circle.,width=321 ]    bcds occupy a position distinct from des in both m@xmath0 - @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23 and m@xmath0 - re scaling relations .",
    "in particular , they have a higher surface brightness than des of similar magnitude .",
    "ugc  6741 which has a total luminosity similar to the brightest bcds in the comparison sample lies within the locus of des .",
    "@xcite proposed a formation channel of some des through a bcd phase , an evolution scheme that ugc  6741 may also follow . yet , given its current star formation rate of 0.18 m@xmath18 yr@xmath9 and the mass of its gas reservoir estimated from the hi data , its gas depletion time is high ( @xmath233 gyr ) .",
    "thus additional processes other than star - formation are needed to remove the gas reservoir and make ugc  6741 a gas - poor red and dead galaxy .",
    "+ therefore , ugc  6741 appears as a scale down version of gas  rich massive interacting systems : like the latter , it hosts a prominent long tidal filament hosting young super star clusters that will possibly evolve into globular clusters or ultra compact dwarf galaxies .",
    "a further comparison study would require high resolution optical imaging and spectroscopy and to acquire hi / co gas maps , in additional to the wealth of multi - wavelength data already available in the archives . such observations would give clues on the future evolution of the system . whether gas  rich dwarf - dwarf mergers form dwarf elliptical galaxies the same way as spiral - spiral mergers form massive ellipticals is still an open question .",
    "cosmological simulations have so far given somehow contradicting results on the merger probability in the dwarf population . a statistical census of tidally interacting dwarfs",
    "should now be carried out .",
    "this was a motivation for us to systematically inspect large scale imaging surveys such as the sdss or the ngvs in the virgo cluster .",
