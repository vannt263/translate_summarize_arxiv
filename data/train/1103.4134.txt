    "the paradigm of hierarchical structure formation is based on the frequent mergers of galaxies and their dark matter halos , as predicted and quantified by cosmological simulations which construct merger trees to track the merger history of halos ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations of galaxies ` caught in the act ' of merging ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) support this theory .",
    "galaxy mergers are believed to be an important phase of galaxy evolution and are thought to be crucial to understanding super - massive black hole ( smbh ) growth , galaxy morphologies , and the truncation of star - formation within galaxies .",
    "while details of the merger process depend on the orbit , mass ratio and morphologies of the galaxies involved , the basic sequence of events for a major ( galaxy mass ratio @xmath13  1:4 ) is relatively well agreed upon @xcite .",
    "galaxies undergoing a merger typically have orbital angular momentum that prevents direct collisions and leads to a series of close passages which have progressively smaller apogees due to dissipation in the merger . during their first close passage ,",
    "the galaxies exert strong tidal forces on each other . for galaxies with a small bulge component , these tidal forces lead to bar formation . the stellar bar lags behind the gaseous bar inducing a torque on the gas which leads to the funneling of gas towards the center of the galaxy",
    "the inflow also leads to higher central gas surface densities which is predicted to spur enhanced star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent close passages lead to smaller inflows as a large fraction of the available gas was used up during a first - passage ` starburst ' .",
    "the second major phase of inflow , therefore , occurs later due to a different mechanism as the galaxies are engaged in final coalescence . at that time",
    ", the remaining gas is brought rapidly to the center by dissipation into a dense compact central structure that rapidly forms stars .",
    "the final remnant galaxy in merger simulations is commonly an elliptical , dispersion - dominated system that has ceased star - formation because its gas reservoir is used up in the starbursts and lost via stellar or agn feedback ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , the details of the effectiveness of ` quenching ' star - formation and the actual process that is responsible varies between different studies and depends on the choice of numerical prescription .    for galaxies with large bulge components ,",
    "the initial bar formation is suppressed and star formation is far less elevated in the early stages of the merger .",
    "consequently , there is a large reservoir of gas remaining until the stages of final coalescence and the final starburst is more extreme .",
    "because the galaxies coalesce over a short timescale , the final starburst can be more intense than that of a bulgeless galaxy during first passage .",
    "some studies @xcite argue that these merger events lead to elevated levels of agn activity and ultimately a quasar ( qso ) phase which is short ( @xmath14 yrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and extremely bright ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "this phase of the supermassive black hole ( smbh ) evolution is thought to dominate the mass accretion history of the black hole @xcite and can profoundly affect its host . during final coalescence ,",
    "the large gas densities near the center of the galaxy ( where the smbh is located ) leads to a large amount of efficient agn fueling that manifests as a qso phase .",
    "this scenario is supported by observations of quasar hosts showing disturbed morphologies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) consistent with being merger remnants .",
    "observations disagree on whether mergers lead to elevated levels of agn activity in the early stages of the merger ( i.e. between first and second passage ) with some ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting an increase and others ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggesting no increase in activity at these early stages .",
    "in addition to their obvious role in increasing galaxy mass , mergers provide a tantalizing solution to several observed cosmological trends .",
    "firstly , they offer a convenient explanation for the various smbh - host relations .",
    "navely , the smbh ( which only has a gravitational sphere of influence @xmath16 the size of the host ) should have no correlation with the properties of its host .",
    "however , smbhs have been observed to be correlated with their host s stellar mass @xcite , velocity dispersion @xcite , dark matter halo mass @xcite , and morphology @xcite .",
    "if black holes are growing in galaxy mergers at the same time that many of these other galactic properties are changing , then this may explain the observed correlations with the host .",
    "in fact , it has been proposed that this simultaneous evolution can lead to these various correlations even without invoking any agn feedback @xcite .",
    "mergers may also be a key ingredient in quenching star - formation within galaxies .",
    "the basic picture is that galaxies can be broadly classified into one of two groups : ( 1 ) actively star forming spiral  blue cloud \" galaxies or ( 2 ) passively evolving elliptical ",
    "dead \" red sequence galaxies .",
    "it appears that the red - sequence galaxies somehow evolve from actively star - forming galaxies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "these hypotheses raise the question of how actively star - forming galaxies are  terminated \" to produce red - sequence galaxies . while there have been many theories proposed ( e.g. , halo quenching ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , one of the more popular solutions is through the agn activity , starbursts , and feedback induced by galaxy mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in such a paradigm , the sequence of events ( as described above ) of the merger lead to a burst of star formation and agn activity whose feedback can unbind a large fraction of the remaining gas .",
    "this quenches the galaxy while the merger also leaves the remnant with an elliptical morphology , seemingly consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "this theory is not without its flaws .",
    "observational evidence suggests that galaxies transitioning from the  blue cloud \" to red sequence ( i.e.  green valley \" galaxies ) do not appear to be dominated by merger remnants @xcite nor the result of rapid quenching @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has established a theoretical framework that , in principle , can be tested with empirical observation .",
    "the details of smbh fueling and feedback as well as star formation and supernova feedback are crucial to understanding the actual role that mergers play in galaxy evolution .",
    "however , merger simulations can not realistically implement these processes due to the relevant physical scales spanning a dynamic range of sub - pc to many kpc scales .",
    "additionally , simulations are regularly unable to accurately couple radiative transfer to the hydrodynamics due to high computational expense .",
    "simulators are thus forced to implement tuned sub - grid models which sometimes are not physically well - motivated ( e.g. , using bondi - hoyle accretion ; see @xcite ) .",
    "thus there remain many open questions about the processes at work during a galaxy merger that simulations will be unable to enlighten for the foreseeable future . as such",
    ", observations are required to improve our understanding and guide future theoretical effort .",
    "however , observational studies of these processes are challenging for a number of reasons .",
    "in contrast to studies of nearby , merging galaxies which permit sensitive searches for disturbed morphologies and faint tidal structures ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , such analysis at higher redshift becomes prohibitive owing to the great distance .",
    "low surface brightness tidal features are too faint to observe and one requires much higher angular resolution to detect small morphological features at higher redshift .",
    "additionally , for all but the nearest galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , observational studies of mergers are limited to studying the stellar distribution because the emission from the bulk of the gas is invisible at cosmological distances .",
    "however , it has been shown that gas and stars may have completely different velocity structures and distributions , especially in systems where a galaxy is undergoing a phase of enhanced agn activity @xcite . since the dynamics of the gas and not the stars ultimately fuel agn activity and star formation , meaningful studies of these processes require the ability to study gas in mergers .",
    "lastly , while the various feedback prescriptions may be tuned to match global properties of an ensemble population of galaxies , they must also be tested against actual merging systems .",
    "this gap in our understanding motivated a novel method for finding and studying merging galaxies that is inspired by the serendipitous discovery of a remarkable prototype .",
    "in our method , we search for systems where the ionizing flux of the quasar `` lights up '' the gas in a merger in order to find new observational constraints on merger models .    with an ionizing photon flux ( @xmath17 ) of @xmath18 photons / s / sr @xcite ,",
    "a quasar can ionize gas to conditions comparable to regions out to distances of 60  kpc . while observations of highly ionized gas with large ( tens of kpc ) spatial extent known as extended emission line regions ( eelrs ) have been known for decades @xcite ,",
    "our study focuses on a novel application of this standard result where we utilize quasar photoionization to study a pair of merging galaxies . in detail , we focus on an eelr produced by a quasar that has been triggered by a merger event . during such a merger ,",
    "one also expects extended tidal features of gas out to distances of  100 kpc that may be photoionized by the quasar and could thus be rendered visible through recombination and forbidden lines .",
    "observations have confirmed that such extended material that may be associated with a galaxy merger can be seen in emission lines near at least one quasar @xcite .",
    "our prototype was serendipitously discovered while selecting targets for a study of gas in the extended halos of galaxies via quasar sight lines ( tumlinson et al in prep . ) .",
    "that study used the sloan digital sky survey dr5 @xcite to find foreground galaxies close to quasar sight lines based on photometric redshifts .",
    "however the galaxy they had hoped to be in front of j2049 - 0012 ( a z=0.369 quasar ) by a cosmological distance was in fact found to have the same redshift .",
    "further inspection revealed that the long - slit spectrum of the system contained bright emission lines along a remarkable gas `` bridge '' connecting the quasar to its companion galaxy , 38  away in projection , and photoionized by the hard spectrum of the quasar .",
    "this bridge is most likely the result of a tidal interaction of the galaxies during the first passage of their ongoing merger .",
    "the extended gas around these objects , normally completely invisible at this distance , is being lit - up by radiation from the quasar .",
    "this provides an unparalleled opportunity to study the kinematics and structure of the gas in the merger , which otherwise we would not have even known was occuring . at the same time",
    ", we have detailed measurements of the galaxy properties , including the outer regions of the quasar s host galaxy .",
    "the companion galaxy is also a member of the ` green valley ' and we are afforded the chance to examine this poorly understood and rare phase of galaxy evolution in this merger context .",
    "this is the first in a pair of papers on this particular system .",
    "this paper focuses on the details of the merging system ( mass ratio , timescales , separation , merger stage , companion galaxy properties , smbh mass and luminosity ) as well as discussion of the emission line bridge and an explanation for its ionization source .",
    "paper ii focuses on the quasar including its lifetime , isotropy , impact on companion galaxy , implications for its triggering , and the placement of the smbh on magorrian - like relations at a peculiar phase of its evolution .",

    "two long slit spectra were taken using lris with a 1.0@xmath23 slit width , d560 dichroic , 600/4000 grism , and 600/7500 grating tilted to an angle of 28.15@xmath24 .",

    "we used the 0.7@xmath23 long slit , d560 dichroic , and 1200/7500 grating blazed to an angle of 40.15 .",

    "the fwhm for each of these setups was estimated by measuring the parameters of gaussian models fit to sky lines in the science exposures .",
    "all of the above spectra were taken with the long slit aligned along the line connecting the two sources ( so that both the quasar and companion galaxy were within the slit ) .",
    "another spectrum was taken using the lick observatory s shane 3-meter with the kast spectrograph .",
    "this spectrum was taken with a position angle ( pa ) perpendicular to the line connecting the quasar / galaxy pair , roughly halfway in between ( such that neither the quasar nor the companion were in the slit ) .",
    "this spectrum was taken with the d55 dichroic and 600/7500 grating .",
    "this grating was tilted to span a wavelength range of approximately @xmath30   with a dispersion of 2.37  / pixel .",
    "additionally we imaged the system with the lris camera for one 60 , one 200 , and two 230 second exposures in the @xmath31 band as well as one 90 , and three 200 second exposures in the @xmath32 band ( 2008 - 10 - 03 ) .",
    "the seeing was @xmath33 fhwm .",
    "we reduced the spectra using the low - reduxxavier / lowredux/ ] pipeline developed by j. hennawi , s. burles , d. schlegel , and j. x. prochaska .",
    "we implemented this program to perform the following procedures : ( 1 ) process the flats , ( 2 ) use arcs to make a 2-dimensional wavelength image , ( 3 ) make a slit profile , ( 4 ) process the images , ( 5 ) identify objects in the slit and trace them , ( 6 ) perform sky subtraction , ( 7 ) extract the spectra , ( 8) correct for flexure of the spectrograph using sky lines , and ( 9 ) create a sensitivity function from a standard star .",
    "slight modifications to the standard pipeline were necessary to perform sky subtraction due to the extended emission and the proximity of the galaxy to the quasar .",
    "specifically , we turned off local sky subtraction after verifying that a global fit provided a good estimate of the sky background in the region of interest .",
    "next , we coadded the images using long - coadd2d , a code developed by robert da silva and michele fumagalli , removing cosmic rays through comparisons of the separate exposures .",
    "the atmosphere and instrument response influence the intensity and shape of the recorded spectrum . for point sources , the standard procedure to convert",
    "the observed spectrum into astronomical flux units is to construct a sensitivity function from the spectrum of a spectrophotometric standard star observed with the same instrumental configuration .",
    "this is done in 1-dimension , meaning that a 1-dimensional spectrum is extracted from the 2d output spectrum from the instrument and is then compared with a 1d model .",
    "we performed this procedure and applied the resulting sensitivity function to the objects extracted in the slit .",
    "unfortunately the region near the dichroic ( @xmath34 ) was particularly difficult to calibrate for the 2008 - 10 - 03 observations .",
    "in particular , we find that the fluxing resulted in a galaxy spectrum that had an unphysical behavior near the dichroic .",
    "we correct for this through comparison of our keck / lris spectrum of the qso and the sdss spectrum of the same qso .",
    "although the absolute and relative fluxes of quasars are known to vary , the color variation is generally small for rest wavelengths greater than 2500   @xcite . avoiding issues that may arise from fe emission lines we only sought to fit the general shape of the continuum across the boundary . in order to account for any discrepancies between ours and the sdss fluxing , we matched the spectra by allowing our keck / lris spectrum to be multiplied by a polynomial in wavelength . to find the best such 2nd order polynomial we used the singular valued decomposition method .",
    "once the overall shapes of the spectra was matched using the above procedure , we fit a 3rd degree polynomial to each side of the dichroic for both the sdss and matched lris 2008 - 10 - 03 spectra . the ratio of those polynomial fits was used to correct the lris spectra .",
    "thus the spectrum correction forces the lris spectrum of the qso to have the same shape in the region around the dichroic as the sdss spectrum .",
    "this same correction was then applied to the companion galaxy spectrum .",
    "the final product from the above procedure was a sensitivity function that converts electrons per second per spectral pixel into astronomical flux units .",
    "this allows us to calibrate the extracted , 1d spectrum of any object in the slit . our data , however , features extended emission that spans many arcseconds spatially . therefore we also require a 2-dimensional flux calibration that converts electrons per second per detector pixel into surface brightness units .",
    "to accomplish this task , we needed to apply the 1-dimensional fluxing ( which has a mapping of pixel to sensitivity that is accurate at the center of the slit ) , to the entire 2d spectrum . assuming that the appropriate correction factor is only a function of wavelength ( specifically that there was a 1-to-1 mapping of wavelength to sensitivity )",
    "we can apply this correction to the entire ccd using the 2-dimensional wavelength image constructed with low - redux from the arc - lamp images .",
    "interpolation of our sensitivity function evaluated at every pixel s wavelength gives a correction factor which we then apply to the spectra .",
    "since we had taken long slit data , each of our spectra had portions of the ccd illuminated only by the sky .",
    "we used these to test the 1-to-1 assumption described above by measuring sigma - clipped medians along the spectral direction across spatial regions .",
    "the spatial variation in sensitivity along the slit was found to be at most a 1% effect .",

    "this required construction of an accurate model of the flux from each object .",
    "we took the 2-dimensional profile fits from low - redux ( interpolating over the emission - line regions ) and multiplied by the 1-dimensional boxcar extraction .",
    "an additional complication arises from the companion galaxy s balmer absorption lines . to account for these spectral features",
    ", we used the stellar population model described in @xmath22  [ sec : stellarpops ] , to model the absorption for the h@xmath27 and h@xmath69 fluxes .",
    "this resulted in a spectrum containing only the emission lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lineprofs ] ) .",
    "the main contributions to the error are the statistical errors of the signal ( poisson errors ) and the errors associated with our data reduction ( i.e. sky subtraction and continuum subtraction ) . while the former is relatively straightforward to estimate , the latter is more difficult .",
    "we estimated this systematic error through analysis of our science images that had been sky and profile subtracted as follows .",
    "for every pixel in these images , we calculated the sigma - clipped mean and standard deviation in a square region with 10 pixels on a side ( after masking known cosmic rays and the emission lines themselves ) .",
    "we then have an image of the local means and an image of the local standard deviations . for each emission line we picked a region from these images of means and standard deviations that is nearby ( but does not include emission ) and proceeded to take their averages .",
    "we then add an additional error term in quadrature with the poisson errors equal to the average of the standard deviations in this region .",
    "we also include an additional error associated with over / undersubtracting the profiles that is characterized by applying the entire profile subtraction algorithm to regions that contain no emission lines and measuring fluxes in the same velocity apertures in those regions .",
    "lastly , when comparing line fluxes we must take care to consider the same spatial region for each of the emission lines . because our observations were taken with different cameras each with a different plate scale , the spatial region determined by an integer number of pixels for one of the plate scales",
    "is not generally equal to an integer number of pixels for others .",
    "therefore , we insure we are comparing the same region by interpolating the spectrum onto a grid 100 times finer in spatial and velocity resolution .",
    "we note that this is valid as our platescales , seeing , and dispersion render the data nyquist sampled in all of the observations .",
    "we then use the spatial centroid of the quasar continuum light as a reference and extract along the same spatial intervals for all the lines .",
    "we then apply velocity extraction windows as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lineprofs ] .",
    "the velocity extraction windows are broader for the [ ] lines because they form a doublet and are treated as a single line which is therefore seen to have a larger velocity spread .",
    "the h@xmath27 and [ ] lines have slightly smaller velocity windows to prevent overlap with nearby bright skylines .",
    "the flux measurements are presented in table  [ table : linefluxes ] .",

    "the dotted lines show theoretical estimates of this ratio at a range of temperatures spanning reasonable expectations for photoionized gas @xcite .",
    "the agreement between the observations and theoretical prediction implies that there is little dust in the bridge and only modest extinction within the companion galaxy .",
    "the figure also shows how the brightness of an emission line varies with distance from the quasar .",
    "the apparent trend is that lines coming from higher ionization species reach their brightest intensities ( relative to other lines ) closer to the quasar while lower ionization species show the opposite trend .",
    "thus the ratios [ ] /h@xmath69 , [ ] / [ ] , and [ ] / [ ] are decreasing with increasing distance from the quasar .",

    "the ratio of [ ] to [ ] constrains the ionization parameter of the gas ( which is an indicator of the ionization state of the gas ) .",
    "indeed , the presence of [ ] emission alone requires a source of high energy photons or high temperature ( @xmath91 ) gas ( with an ionization potential exceeding 7 rydberg , regions will not typically produce this line ) .",

    "we choose the [ ] @xmath92 line because it is the brightest observed line with the highest signal - to - noise ratio .",

    "the dominant source of uncertainty in these kinematic measures is related to systematic effects .",
    "specifically , the wavelength solution based on the arc lamp images has a typical rms residual of @xmath93pixels corresponding to a velocity of @xmath94 .",
    "the systematic velocity error due to this effect is calculated for each line by ( 1 ) measuring the rms of the residuals from our wavelength solution in units of pixels ( 2 ) multiplying the rms by the dispersion (  / pix ) to get the wavelength rms ( 3 ) then estimating the error that is introduced at each line s observed wavelength .",
    "these errors are added in quadrature with the fitting errors .",
    "we find that the kinematics of the [ ] @xmath95 line trace the [ ] @xmath92 emission@xmath95 kinematics to those derived from the r600/7500 grating for [ ] @xmath92 since they were measured with comparable resolution . ] ; it is thus very likely that these ions are co - spatial .",
    "this is a crucial point for the determination of the ionization source , as it allows us to demand that the same ionization mechanism produce each of these ions and their observed line ratio .",

    "the width of a nearby unresolved sky line is plotted as a dashed line to indicate the resolution limit of the spectrum .",
    "since the velocity dispersions are higher than those of a nearby skyline we appear to have spectroscopically resolved the emission of the bridge , but it is unclear if we have done so spatially . specifically , we emphasize that if there are spatial gradients in the velocity field that are unresolved they have the effect of artificially increasing the velocity dispersion because the gradient is smeared .",
    "thus one might misinterpret spatially unresolved velocity shear as random motions . to quantify this effect we created a mock 2d spectrum with the same central velocities and brightnesses as a function of position as those measured from our data . to isolate the effects of this spatial smearing we set the velocity dispersions of each spatial pixel equal to that of the unresolved skyline .",
    "we then smoothed this 2d spectrum in the spatial direction according to a spatial resolution element of 0.7@xmath23 and measured the velocity dispersion in the same manner as for the data .",
    "the result is represented as the red dotted curve and can be interpreted as the expected effective resolution limit as a result of both finite velocity resolution and astronomical seeing .",
    "since the velocity dispersion is still higher than this curve , it appears we are also spatially resolving the velocity dispersion ( as long as the gradients are not smaller than the seeing ) .",
    "the velocity of the quasar spectrum as measured from agn emission lines is generally a poor measure of the systemic velocity for its host galaxy ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "we conclude that the quasar is shining on the bridge and photoionizing the gas and test this hypothesis using cloudy models .",
    "shocks are common occurrences in galaxy mergers and also result from the interaction of quasar jets with the interstellar and circumgalactic media of the galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . if those shocks are fast enough , they could ionize gas along the bridge .",
    "there are two ways in which shocks can lead to ionization : ( 1 ) collisional ionization of the shocked gas or ( 2 ) radiative shocks that photoionize the pre - shock gas with the radiation emitted by the post - shock gas .",
    "we begin by addressing the first possibility : whether gas in the bridge has been collisionally ionized .",
    "if the gas were collisionally ionized , then emission from high ionization potential states such as , would require a very large electron temperature .",
    "we can estimate @xmath187 using the [ ] transitions as these form a temperature diagnostic in the density regime @xmath188 @xcite : @xmath189 this diagnostic is valid as long as the density is below the critical density of the [ ] transitions .",
    "if the density were higher than this critical density , the flux would be attenuated dramatically since at these densities collisional deexcitation dominates over radiative deexcitation .",
    "such high density , however , would imply much lower [ ] /h@xmath69 ratios than observed .",
    "such a density is also many orders of magnitude higher than normal ism densities and is highly unlikely .",
    "the conservative upper limit to the [ ] @xmath190 line flux sets an upper limit to the gas temperature of @xmath191 k. this is over 4 times lower than the characteristic temperature of ( @xmath192 k ; * ? ? ?",
    "the detection of [ ] @xmath1933426,3346 combined with the temperature upper limit from [ ] rules out the hypothesis that the primary ionization source is collisional ionization .",
    "radiative shocks , via photoionization , can produce high ionization lines in conditions with lower electron temperatures . in such shocks , the post - shock gas reaches high temperatures and its emission photoionizes the pre - shock gas .",
    "this produces a gas that is ionized by a relatively hard spectrum .",
    "however , the observed emission line ratios in the bridge are inconsistent with those given by the diagnostic diagrams of @xcite for fast radiative shock+precursor models that span shock velocities of 100 - 1000 km / s , magnetic paramters @xmath194 , @xmath195 , and a variety of abundance ratios .",
    "these models take into account both emission of the shocked material and emission from the pre - shock gas .",
    "the line ratios that are clearly discrepant with our observations include the [ ] @xmath196[]@xmath92 and [ ] @xmath197 [ ] @xmath198 ratios .",
    "most striking is that all of these models predict [ ] @xmath95 fainter than [ ] @xmath198 , in direct contradiction with our observations of the bridge ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : shocks ] ) .",
    "lastly , we stress that the bridge emission extends along the entire length of the @xmath199 kpc bridge connecting the two galaxies",
    ". it could be difficult to simultaneously generate shocks across such a large spatial extent .",
    "furthermore , if we assume that the beginning of this interaction ( and hence when the shocking began ) is consistent with the age that we estimate from the stellar population modelling , this could require shocks to be sustained over a very long spatial extent and for a very long time ( @xmath8 myr ) .    using all of the above reasoning , we rule out shocks as a viable mechanism for the ionization of the bridge .      studies of merging systems often reveal evidence for new star formation , and therefore elevated populations of young and massive stars .",
    "these star - forming regions are expected to be surrounded by regions of ionized gas which could produce the line emission observed in the bridge .",
    "we have tested this hypothesis in the following manner .",
    "looking at the bpt diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bpt ] ) as first presented in @xmath22  [ sec : metal ] , we see that the spatial bins that contain gas in the bridge ( 0b , 1b , 2b ) , show the bridge emission line ratios are consistent with gas ionized by an agn spectrum .",
    "the gas in these bins also emits [ ] lines ; common tracers of agn photoionization @xcite .",
    "in fact the detection of strongly rules out regions as the dominant ionization source because stars lack a hard enough spectrum to effectively ionize ne to this high of an ionization state .",
    "looking at the two bins which cover the galaxy ( 3 g and 4 g ) , the emission characteristics vary dramatically across the two regions . while bin 4 g ( the far - side of the galaxy ) has a strong contribution from regions , bin 3 g ( the near side of the galaxy ) falls somewhat in between the regions of agn and region ionization .",
    "this abrupt change in emission characteristics is consistent with a model where the quasar is photoionizing the gas in the bridge and the near side of the galaxy but where the galaxy effectively shields its own far side from the radiation .",
    "the abrupt change of the emission characteristics of bin 3 g from those of the bridge is likely the result of the gas changing from the optically thin conditions of bins 0b , 1b , and 2b to the optically thick conditions of the disk of the galaxy in bin 3 g .",
    "bin 3 g , also likely has some contribution from regions , complicating its analysis .      in the previous sections we ruled out shocks and stellar photoionization as the source of ionization for the bridge material .",
    "we also inferred , from investigation of the bpt diagram , that the line ratios were likely the result of photoionization by a quasar . in this section ,",
    "we test this hypothesis by comparing our observations with photoionization models .",
    "emission line ratios can inform one about the physical conditions of a photoionized gas as well as the properties of the incident ionizing radiation .",
    "we utilize cloudy version 08.00 photoionization simulations @xcite to determine if photoionization by a quasar s radiation field can reproduce our observed line ratios and then we infer physical conditions from these ratios .",
    "our observations include a variety of line ratios for this purpose .",

    "we included the appropriate cmb as well as cosmic rays , but these sources of ionization have little consequence for our calculations .",
    "we ran models with metallicities of @xmath201[fe / h]@xmath202 .",
    "we note that our implementation of metallicity is just a scaling of all elements equally relative to solar and hence [ fe / h ] can be interpreted as a generic [ m / h ] , [ o / h ] , or any [ x / h ] .",
    "we varied the strength of the ionizing radiation by varying the ionization parameter @xmath203 which is defined as the ratio of the ionizing photon density to hydrogen density : @xmath204 where @xmath45 is the distance from the ionizing source , @xmath205 is the number density of the gas , and @xmath17 is the ionizing photon luminosity of the source .",

    ", we analyzed the sdss photometry to estimate a stellar mass of @xmath122 .",
    "for the galaxy hosting the quasar , we can not directly measure the stellar light but instead estimate its stellar mass using standard smbh - host relations . taking the estimated smbh mass of @xmath211 @xcite and the @xcite relation @xmath259",
    ", we estimate @xmath260 for the stellar mass of the bulge component .",
    "this gives a stellar mass ratio of @xmath2581:4 .",
    "if the quasar host galaxy has a stellar mass in a disk component then this ratio shrinks even smaller .",
    "this result also hinges on whether the black hole currently lies on the magorrian relation .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the system has a mass ratio of approximately 1:4 with an uncertainty on the order of a factor of 2 .",
    "therefore , the event most likely either just satisfies the major - merger ( 1:4 ) definition or lies somewhat below the canonical threshold .",
    "our observational analysis of the  system provides a comprehensive and quantitative description of an interacting pair of galaxies at @xmath261 . in turn , it affords the opportunity to directly test the standard paradigm for galaxy mergers as modeled by numerical simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the current theoretical understanding of galaxy interactions is that galaxy mergers with mass ratios larger than @xmath258 1:10 generally follow a basic sequence of events with two possible phases of elevated star formation and agn activity : one right after first passage and the other during final coalescence .",
    "the absolute and relative strengths of these two phases depends on the galaxy morphology ( e.g.  whether the galaxies have gas , the presence of a bulge ) and details of the star - formation prescription .",
    "in such a paradigm , the combination of the detection of a tidal bridge and the current projected separation of @xmath262  kpc place a strong constraint on the merger stage . numerical simulations of major mergers with a variety of orbits ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show that after first passage the galaxies move to a distance of approximately 100 kpc where they reach their point of maximal separation ( first apogee ) .",
    "subsequent passages and separations do not achieve separations as large as 38  kpc .",
    "this result is nearly independent of gas fraction @xcite and mass ratio as long as the mass ratio is larger than 1:9 @xcite .",
    "we conclude , therefore , that the  merger is after first passage ( the bridge requires at least one tidal interaction ) and before second passage .",
    "as described above , the current paradigm predicts that gas - rich galaxies will undergo a burst of star - formation that initiates during or just after first passage ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this is also the only time aside from coalescence where gas inflow is predicted to be sufficiently strong to inspire strong agn activity @xcite .",
    "regarding the  merger , we identify examples of each : one galaxy hosts a bright quasar and the companion galaxy shows signatures of a starburst stellar population ( figure  [ fig : ssp ] ) .",
    "consistent with theory of interactions causing tidal stripping and strong gaseous inflows which lead to large central star bursts , the companion galaxy is observed to be consistent with being centrally concentrated ( we measure a concentration of at least 2.61 , limited by the image s spatial resolution ) .",
    "such compact companions to quasars have been observed around other more nearby qsos @xcite . with standard stellar population modeling",
    ", we found the burst occurred @xmath8  myr ago .",
    "this timescale is significantly shorter than the predicted period between first and second passage for galaxies with our allowed range of mass ratios for standard orbits ( @xmath263gyr ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in merger simulations ,",
    "the level of enhanced star formation during the first passage starburst is sensitive to the star formation prescription ( see * ? ? ?",
    "therefore characterizing this phase may allow greater insights on sub - grid models . to this end",
    ", we would like to constrain the observed mass fraction of the burst .",
    "unfortunately , various degeneracies limit us to only constrain the burst to consist of between @xmath264 of the stellar mass prior to the merger .",
    "another test of the merger paradigm combines the timing of the starburst and the observed configuration of the merger .",
    "the current projected separation of 38  combined with the timescale of @xmath265 myr requires that the galaxies have been moving apart from each other at an average speed of approximately @xmath266 .",
    "this is consistent with the observed timescales and distances seen in galmer merger simulations @xcite .",
    "the observed offset in radial velocities of the two galaxies also follows the standard picture .",
    "the centers of mass for the two galaxies ( as traced by the bright emission lines ) are moving at a relative radial velocity of @xmath97 .",
    "this is consistent with the system being close to apogee , as predicted for a system with an age of @xmath267myr post first passage ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "lastly , merger simulations also offer robust predictions on the physical characteristics of the tidal bridge . in the following few paragraphs",
    ", we discuss how measurements of the bridge properties test the merger paradigm and also present a means for gaining greater understanding into specific mergers .",
    "firstly , we note that the metallicity of the bridge , which we find to be a few tenths dex lower ( @xmath268[m / h]=@xmath269 ) than the companion galaxy , is consistent with having been tidally stripped from the ( presumed ) lower metallicity outskirts of that galaxy .",
    "this is the standard result of the merger paradigm first studied in detail by @xcite .",
    "the outer parts of these extended tidal features arise from the outskirts of galactic disks because the tidal forces are greatest in these regions .    due to the unique emission line bridge of our system , we are able to measure the gas surface density at a point midway between the two interacting galaxies ( @xmath22[sec : column ] ) .",
    "wishing to use this measurement to gain more insight on the interacting pair of galaxies , we turn to numerical simulations .",
    "as this is not a standard observable and lacks sufficient literature detailing its evolution , we have explored the galmer database of galaxy mergers to characterize the bridge s evolution @xcite . using a suite of 1:1 and 1:10 galaxy merger simulations with a variety of spiral morphologies ( 1:1 sa - sa , sa - sb , sa - sd , sb - sb , sb - sd , sd - sd ; 1:10 s0-sa , s0-sb , s0-sd )",
    ", we measured the gas surface density in the corresponding regions of these galaxy mergers at 64 viewing angles evenly spaced in solid angle at all applicable timesteps ( where the galaxies are separated by at least 20 projected kpc and have undergone at least one tidal interaction ) .",
    "the 1:1 mergers have 12 different orbits with each orbit also having 4 different relative orientations of the disks .",
    "the 1:10 mergers are limited by the availability of the models to only have 6 orbits with only 1 generic disk orientation each .",
    "we find that for 1:1 mergers , the bridge forms after first passage and that its surface density reduces roughly exponentially with time ( approximately @xmath270 $ ] with @xmath271100 myr and the normalization correlating with the gas mass of the two galaxies ) as the material rains back onto the two separating galaxies . in the vast majority of cases ,",
    "the gas density falls far below the measured surface density of our bridge ) , the dissipation is rapid enough that our result is relatively robust .",
    "we use our value of the upper limit corresponding to @xmath272 . ] before reaching second closest approach .",
    "these findings indicate standard merger scenarios of galaxies with high gas fraction can reproduce our observations provided we have caught the system before maximal separation .    for 1:10 mergers",
    "we find that the gaseous bridge does not reach sufficiently high surface densities in the bridge for any of the simulations we examined .",
    "we do note that in our 1:10 simulations the larger galaxy does not contain any gas ( we are limited by availability of simulations ) , which is likely a poor match to our system .",
    "this is unlikely to affect our overall results because in such a high mass ratio merger the contribution of the more massive galaxy to the extended tidal features will be minimal because the tidal force it feels is relatively small .",
    "in such a case , the smaller galaxy is much more greatly tidally perturbed , resulting in extended tidal features but at much smaller surface density than observed .",
    "if the mass ratio of the  system were as small as 1:10 , these models would be ruled out .",
    "the kinematics of the bridge further enlighten us about the system ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : kinematics ] ) .",
    "the velocity centroids of the bridge as a function of spatial position show that the side of the bridge closer to the companion galaxy has a higher radial velocity than the side closer to the quasar .",
    "if the gas is freely flowing towards the centers of mass of the two galaxies , this suggests that the companion galaxy is background to the quasar .",
    "this argument is confirmed by an examination of the galmer merger simulations .",
    "the measured velocity dispersion of @xmath273 km / s indicates an intrinsic velocity dispersion of @xmath274 km / s after we remove instrumental effects .",
    "this is much higher than that found in 21 cm maps of tidal debris around local interacting galaxies which have typical velocity dispersions of @xmath275 km / s @xcite .",
    "one possible explanation is suggested by the clumpy nature of the emission : portions of the bridge may have become self - gravitating .",
    "such structures are observed in the tidal features of local galaxies and can have large velocity gradients @xmath276 km / s @xcite .",
    "these structures are also a prediction of merger simulations @xcite .",
    "it is possible that one or several of these structures could add to the velocity dispersion .",
    "one immediate challenge to this possibility is the lack of obvious star formation associated with the bridge .",
    "however , if the bridge is fully ionized , it is possible that the large ionization fraction of the gas has suppressed star formation .",
    "this is supported by the recent observational evidence that there is a neutral gas column density threshold ( @xmath277 ) for star formation in tidal material @xcite .",
    "another possible explanation is that dispersion has been elevated by some sort of turbulence possibly associated with shocks that are thought to occur throughout the course of the merger as a result of the bulk motions of the galaxies .    given that we observe a bridge of material that we believe to be photoionized by the quasar , one might ask if other tidal material should be observable ( i.e. structures associated with extended tidal tails ) . we have not detected such material , to sensitive limits , in our keck / lris longslit observations .",
    "there are several reasons , however , why we may expect the non - detection of other extended emission .",
    "firstly , there may be no tidal tails .",
    "@xcite present a compilation of maps of merging galaxies and find 16 examples of merging galaxy pairs ( of 181 total unusual gas morphology examples ) with an observed bridge and no tidal tails .",
    "similarly , the galmer merger simulation database @xcite has many examples of such systems .",
    "secondly , the tidal tails may simply not have fallen into the longslit of our spectroscopic observations .",
    "finally , the tidal material could have too low density to render it observable ; emission is an @xmath278 process and a factor of 3 less dense gas results @xmath279 times fainter emission .",
    "we conclude that the non - detection of additional , tidal material is consistent with the observed bridge and standard merger scenarios .",
    "nevertheless , we are motivated to search for additional emission beyond our longslit observation , e.g.  with an ifu spectrometer .    before concluding , we wish to consider a few issues related to the ` green valley ' nature of the companion galaxy .",
    "we remind the reader that this is a rare and poorly understood phase of galaxy evolution which nevertheless may be critical to understanding the ( expected ) transition from the blue , star - forming sequence to the ` red and dead ' sample .",
    "the first consideration is to understand why the galaxy appears in this unusual portion of color space .",
    "we have found that the peculiar colors are consistent a declining starburst stellar population that would dominate the sed for only another few hundred myr .",
    "the next obvious consideration is whether the galaxy is currently moving toward the blue cloud or red sequence .",
    "unfortunately , any such prediction hinges on bold extrapolation of the future sfh .",
    "if we assume that the observed sfr continues indefinitely ( i.e.  at @xmath280 ) , then we find that the galaxy evolves to becomes slightly bluer ( @xmath139 decreasing by 0.1 mag ) over approximately 1 gyr .",
    "however if the star formation ceases then the stellar populations will passively evolve to become red after several hundred myr .",
    "if the galaxies are to undergo further interactions with each other , then the star formation history may follow one of the standard tracks towards quenching ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "this system may also provide insights on some of the large number of newly discovered double peaked [ ] emitters @xcite . if observed with sufficiently poor spatial resolution , it is possible that the bridge or the companion galaxy s emission associated with photoionization from the quasar may result in the appearance of a double - peaked [ ] profile separated by approximately 20 km / s resulting from just a single active smbh .",
    "one could imagine that if caught closer in time to a close passage , where the radial velocity difference of the two galaxies would be greater , the velocity difference may be large enough to produce the @xmath281 km / s offsets observed in that sample .",
    "this explanation is may be the most likely for a subset of their systems ( rosario et al . in prep . ) .",
    "in summary , we have compiled physical constraints on a galaxy merger at modest redshift which allows for a direct test of the merger paradigm developed by state - of - the - art simulations .",
    "impressively , the merger characteristics are consistent with the standard paradigm for each of the comparisons summarized in table  [ table : comparison ] .",
    "our analysis presents a relatively clear - cut example of a quasar being triggered during a first passage interaction .",
    "observational characteristics allow it to be directly compared with simulations to constrain triggering mechanisms .",
    "we have copious amounts of information about the companion galaxy and obvious questions emerge such as : why is one galaxy in a quasar phase while the other is not",
    "? has the companion galaxy already undergone a quasar phase ?",
    "are the black holes in each galaxy now and will they later be on the many black hole - host relations ? how does a first passage quasar affect the evolution of a merger vs. one where neither galaxy goes into a quasar phase until final coalescence ?",
    "paper  ii presents the insights that we gain from this system about some of these questions as well as discusses constraints on the quasar s lifetime and isotropy that we get by examining the effects of its ionizing radiation .      1 .",
    "we presented a unique interacting quasar / galaxy pair connected by a remarkable 38  bridge of ionized gas visible in emission lines .",
    "while one galaxy is in a quasar phase , its companion shows no detectable agn activity .",
    "3 .   after ruling out collisional ionization and radiative shocks",
    ", we conclude the bridge s source of ionization to be photoionization by the quasar light .",
    "4 .   the companion galaxy s color and spectrum are consistent with a declining starburst stellar population . in this scenario ,",
    "we date the burst stellar population to be @xmath8 myr old .",
    "this intermediate - age stellar population places the galaxy within the ` green valley ' .",
    "we found the companion galaxy to have a sfr of @xmath282 and to have a have a gas - phase oxygen abundance consistent with solar .",
    "the bridge between the two galaxies was characterized to be dependent on a geometric parameter @xmath169 , which we constrain ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cartoon ] ) .",
    "we found expressions for the volume density , column density along line of sight , and mass of the bridge as a function of this parameter .",
    "7 .   with cloudy photoionization modeling , we determine the ionization parameter and metallicity in two separate patches of the bridge .",
    "the bridge is nearly fully ionized in hydrogen and is primiarly comprised of higher ionization species .",
    "the metallicity is consistent with being a few tenths dex smaller than the companion galaxy .",
    "the bridge s velocity dispersion is larger than expected ( @xmath283km / s ) , possibly suggesting that some material in the bridge may be self - gravitating or there is some source of turbulence in the bridge .",
    "9 .   using the projected separation ,",
    "we find the merger stage to be between first and second passage .",
    "this interpretation is consistent with the observed bridge and the inferred starburst stellar population .",
    "10 . based on dynamical measurements and stellar photometry ,",
