    "ic  3418 , a faint low surface brightness galaxy ( @xmath1 ) in the virgo cluster was observed with the _ galaxy evolution explorer _  ( _ galex _ , * ? ? ?",

    "the uv morphology revealed in the moderately deep _ galex _ images of ic  3418 is a potentially powerful probe of its tail s formation mechanism .",
    "it has been suggested that similar tails are either star formation in ram pressure ( rp ) stripped molecular clouds  @xcite or a combination of cloud stripping and gravitational interactions  ( * ? ? ? * c07 ) .",
    "none of these tails appears like known tidal features , and they consist preferentially of gas and young stars .",
    "we estimate that the tidal radii of all of these systems are beyond the disks stellar radii .",
    "star formation occurs in simulated rp stripped wakes when cold clouds and diffuse h  i are tightly dynamically coupled  @xcite . assuming strong dynamical coupling between the gas phases is likely invalid during ram pressure stripping ( rps ) . in simulations that resolve the multiphase medium , high density clouds are not stripped  @xcite . for an observed example ,",
    "isolated star forming clouds remain in the disk of ngc  4402 , another virgo spiral , despite stripping of the h  i  @xcite .",
    "we suggest that the tail of ic  3418 represents in situ molecular cloud and star formation in the galaxy s turbulent wake following rps . in sections  [ ic3418 ] and  [ knots ]",
    "we discuss the observations of ic  3418 and its star - forming tail . in section  [ env ]",

    "we discuss the morphologies of ic  3418 and similar star forming tails ; demonstrating that they favor in situ molecular cloud formation .",
    "ic  3418 is beginning the transition between the blue and red sequences ( @xmath3 ) and is thus interesting in its own right .",
    "the stars in the tail may eventually contribute to the intracluster light ( icl ) , warranting a study of the frequency of these tails .",

    "the galaxy eso 137 - 001 in abell 3627 , a very dynamically young nearby cluster , was discovered to have an extended x - ray tail in which multiple h  ii regions were detected  @xcite .",
    "galaxies with arcs of h  ii regions following the bow shock morphology of the h  i have been observed in virgo  @xcite and abell 1367  @xcite .",
    "the morphology of these arcs suggests cloud stripping , but cloud formation likely occurred in the shock compressed gas while clouds in the outer disk were dissociated and then stripped .",
    "isolated dense clouds can be ablated by the icm wind  @xcite , dissociated if a shock is driven directly into them  @xcite , and heated by star formation and then stripped  @xcite .",

    "giant molecular clouds may spawn multiple episodes of star formation .",
    "the cloud experiences a force from the icm wind , but the newly formed stars do not . due to the differing accelerations ,",
    "the newly formed stars are essentially dropped from the cloud , which itself is supported by the icm wind .",

    "large @xmath103 create long filaments .",
    "accordingly , the long stellar filaments behind rb  199 are indicative of large @xmath103 , itself characteristic of dynamical coupling between the gas phases and therefore of cloud stripping . the @xmath106 can be estimated as @xmath108 , or , for the h  i disk , @xmath109 @xmath110 which can form a 10 kpc filament in 30 myr .",
    "assuming molecular clouds that are not dynamically coupled to the h  i , @xmath111 ( see section  [ env ] ) , corresponding to much shorter  filaments \" .",
    "the treatment above assumes that the cloud and its filament orbit together .",
    "in contrast , both tides , which increase the distance between two episodes as they fall , and the icm wind , which continuously increases the orbital energy of a cloud while it exists , work to lengthen filaments . therefore , if @xmath112 , then _ only _ long filaments are formed , which conflicts with the observations .",
    "we show below that a plethora of morphologies can be formed with @xmath113 .",
    "the influences of both gas physics and gravity are observed , requiring us to consider both forces .",
    "the streamer in ic  3418 s tail and the filaments observed by y08 and c07 are located close to the galaxy , where tidal forces are strongest .",
    "the extended objects are also redder , indicating that they are older and therefore potentially more dynamically evolved . on the other hand ,",
    "the streamer in ic  3418 shows a strong uv color gradient and , in rb  199 , when a star forming knot is associated with a filament , it is found downwind .",
    "both highlight the role of the icm wind .",
    "figure  [ model ] illustrates the next step in modeling complexity .",
    "we postulate clouds that are generated with a moderate initial velocity heading away from the galaxy .",
    "these clouds fall back toward the galaxy .",
    "each track with its related line segments represents two episodes of star formation separated by @xmath114  myr , which is motivated by the uv gradient in the streamer , as they fall in an nfw potential .",
    "both episodes have the same initial orbit , but the higher , later forming , episode has an additional acceleration for the first @xmath104 .",
    "the line segments represent potential knots and filaments .    in simulations , rp stripped gas is accelerated to the rest velocity of the icm , but travels away from the galaxy as it accelerates .",
    "gas located close to the galaxy has a lower velocity with respect to the galaxy and turbulent flow around the disk can cause gas to actually fall back onto the galaxy from the wake ( * ? ? ?",
    "* r08 ) . in the model , increasing a cloud s initial velocity increases the filament length until the velocity exceeds the escape velocity and the knot speeds away without forming a filament .",
    "the left and right panels of figure  [ model ] represent the tails of ic  3418 and rb  199 , respectively .",
    "they are differentiated by their overall length scale and age . in each , @xmath115 is within the range allowed by observations . in simulations ,",
    "tail length is determined by the mass loss per orbital length , which will vary considerably between galaxies ( r08 ) .",
    "several suggestive features are reproduced in figure  [ model ] .",
    "knots , short streamers , and long filaments all form .",
    "as seen in the observations , the filaments lengths and ages are correlated , particularly for neighboring objects , and in each tail the longest filaments are found closest to the galaxy . for a nice example of the first feature , compare d2 and its surrounding knots .",
    "that a simple variation in the length scale reproduces both ic  3418 and rb  199 is an additional success .",
    "tail morphologies are rich with information about their formation mechanisms , which should motivate further modeling .",
    "the current work indicates that the observations favor in situ cloud formation , or at least @xmath113 .",
    "rps of h  i is the only theoretically favored means of removing mass from ic  3418 s disk at its current position in the virgo cluster .",
    "nevertheless , star formation is occurring in the galaxy s wake , requiring the presence of @xmath2 .",
    "we suggest that @xmath2 forms within the stripped wake aided by turbulence .",
    "turbulence in the wakes of rp stripped galaxies has been seen in both simulations ( r08 ) and observations  @xcite . in simulations ,",
    "turbulence can drive both the formation of star clusters within clouds  @xcite and cloud formation itself  @xcite .",
    "the quasi - scale free hierarchical nature of turbulence works to enhance density contrasts in a turbulent region , increasing the chance that gas can cool and collapse .",
    "an alternate theory requires that the @xmath116 in the disk is tightly dynamically bound to the h  i , though no mechanism for this binding is advanced .",
    "we have shown that the morphologies of the tails disfavor this interpretation .    further constraining the tails formation mechanism , and in particular the possible role of turbulence , will require additional observations and improved modeling , presumably using hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "deep , high resolution , imaging of one or more tails in multiple optical bands , uv , and h@xmath0 , for which ic  3418 is a prime candidate , could provide detailed constraints on a model of tail formation .",
