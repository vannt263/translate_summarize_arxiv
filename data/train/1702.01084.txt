    "heavy quarks such as charm and bottom are excellent probes to understand the properties of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) created in high energy heavy - ion collisions .",
    "both charm and bottom quarks have masses significantly larger than the quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) scale parameter @xmath10 0.2 gev , and as such , their production is limited to the primordial nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "heavy flavor production in the subsequent early , hot stages of heavy - ion collisions is not significant and thus any modification of the primordial heavy flavor phase space distributions in heavy ion collisions will be the result of the quarks traversing the qgp and later phases in the space time evolution .",
    "prior to the studies of heavy flavor production done at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) , the high suppression @xcite of light flavor hadrons was primarily associated to radiative energy loss via medium - induced gluon radiation .",
    "this predicted a distinctive mass hierarchy of high suppression as measured via the nuclear modification factor @xmath11 , implying that hadrons with heavy flavor will have a smaller suppression : @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 denotes the nuclear modification of @xmath14 , defined as the ratio of yield measured in @xmath15 collisions to the yield measured in collisions scaled by the number of binary collisions for @xmath15 system , and @xmath16(or @xmath17 ) denotes the same for charm ( or bottom ) quarks .",
    "however , the measurements showed similar suppression for light and heavy flavor hadrons . including collisional energy loss via elastic scattering , which is more important for heavy flavor than for the light quarks , leads to a qualitative explanation of the large energy loss for heavy flavor  @xcite .",
    "but other approaches are similarly successful , including langevin - based transport models  @xcite and ads / cft ( anti de - sitter - space / conformal field theory ) string drag energy loss models  @xcite . despite significant effort , a full quantitative understanding of the energy loss",
    "has not been achieved yet .    to test different theoretical approaches , it is crucial to understand primordial heavy flavor production , and any modifications there in the presence of nuclei .",
    "primordial heavy flavor production can be studied in collisions . when nuclei are involved in a collision",
    ", one might expect modifications to the initial state , which can be described as shadowing or anti shadowing of the parton distribution functions .",
    "also modifications in the final state that can be expressed as changes of the fragmentation process are possible , for example , via energy loss or re - scattering in cold nuclear matter .",
    "it is commonly accepted that these effects are observable in collisions , where qgp formation is not expected .",
    "differences between the single electron spectra from heavy flavor decays from data and data have been interpreted as cold nuclear matter effects  @xcite .",
    "recently hints of collectivity have been found in high multiplicity events from collisions of small nucleus with a large nuclei , which suggests that hot matter might even be formed in small systems .",
    "however , one would not expect sizable collective effects on the heavy flavor phase space distributions even if hot matter is created due to the small reaction volume in these collisions .",
    "the primordial heavy flavor production can be calculated in the framework of perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) .",
    "therefore , measurement of heavy flavor in serves as a test for these calculations and can be used to improve monte - carlo ( mc ) generators .",
    "results from mc generators can be scaled to or collision systems with the number of binary collisions and serve as a reference for observables in the absence of data .    at rhic ,",
    "open heavy flavor production has been measured by both the phenix and star experiments in different collision systems , spanning , , cu@xmath2cu and systems , and by exploiting various techniques such as single electrons / muons via semi - leptonic decays  @xcite , electron - hadron correlations  @xcite , @xmath18  @xcite ,  @xcite and also via reconstruction of @xmath19-mesons  @xcite .",
    "this paper reports the measurement of heavy flavor production via dielectrons in collisions at midrapidity .",
    "the pairs coming from the semi - leptonic decays of charm and bottom dominate different regions in mass and allowing to disentangle the two contributions . studying the pairs from heavy flavor",
    "may also provide sensitivity to the heavy quark correlations which is important to constrain the mc models .",
    "the results from the data from this paper can be directly compared to the previously published data  @xcite that exploited the same technique .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii describes the experimental apparatus and trigger .",
    "section iii details the data analysis including electron identification , background subtraction , and efficiency corrections .",
    "a description of the hadronic cocktail and heavy flavor generators is outlined in section iv , followed by studies of systematic uncertainties in section v. the data are presented as double differential spectra in mass and @xmath6 in section vi . the final results and the comparison of and , as well as the comparison to several models of charm and bottom production are discussed in section vii .",
    "section viii gives our summary and conclusions .",
    "a detailed description of the phenix detector is available in  @xcite .",
    "we focus here on the components of the two central arm spectrometers and the beam - beam counters ( bbcs ) that are critical for the analysis of pairs .",
    "each of the two central arms cover a pseudorapidity range of @xmath200.35 ( 70@xmath21110@xmath22 ) and 90@xmath22 in azimuthal angle @xmath23 .",
    "they are located almost back - to - back , with an angular gap of 67.5@xmath22 between them at the top .",
    "they span a range from about 220 cm to 500 cm radially from the beam axis .",
    "the location of collision vertex in the beam direction , the collision time , and the minimum bias ( mb ) trigger are provided by a system of two beam - beam counters ( bbc ) that are located at a distance of 144 cm from the nominal interaction point on either side .",
    "each bbc covers the full azimuth and a rapidity range of 3.1 @xmath24 3.9 .",
    "the collision vertex resolution in the beam direction is approximately 2 cm for collisions .",
    "the mb trigger requires a coincidence between both sides with at least one hit on each side , and accepts the events if the bbc vertex is within 38 cm of the nominal interaction point .",
    "the bbc cross section in collisions was determined via the van der meer scan technique  @xcite and was found to be @xmath25 mb or 0.545 @xmath26 0.06 of the total inelastic cross section of @xmath27 mb .",
    "there are two primary charged particle tracking subsystems in phenix : drift chambers ( dc ) and pad chambers ( pc )  @xcite .",
    "the dc along with first layer of pc ( pc1 ) form the inner tracking system used here .",
    "the dc measures the trajectories of charged particles in the plane perpendicular to the beams and allows one to determine their charge and transverse momentum .",
    "the pc1 provides a space point along the trajectory of charged particles , which is used to determine the polar angle @xmath28 and @xmath29-coordinate of the track .",
    "the momentum resolution for this data set is @xmath30 = 0.011 @xmath31 0.0116@xmath32[gev/@xmath33 .",
    "each central arm is equipped with a ring imaging erenkov ( rich ) detector that serves as the primary device for electron identification . with @xmath34 as a radiator gas , an @xmath35 rejection of better than one part in @xmath3610@xmath37",
    "is achieved , for the tracks with momenta below the pion erenkov threshold of @xmath36 4.87 gev/@xmath38 . for each electron on average",
    "10 erenkov photons are reconstructed on a ring of 11.8 cm diameter with an array of photo multiplier tubes .",
    "further electron identification is provided by the electromagnetic calorimeters ( emcal ) that measure the spatial position and energy of the electrons .",
    "this is achieved by placing a cut on the ratio of the energy measured by emcal and momentum given by the dc  @xcite .",
    "to select potentially interesting events containing electrons , phenix uses a hardware trigger known as ert ( emcal - rich ) trigger .",
    "the trigger is based on the online sum of the energy signals in a tile of @xmath39 emcal towers @xcite .",
    "for all emcal trigger tiles above a predetermined threshold value , the location of the emcal tile is matched with hits in the corresponding rich tile ( @xmath40 pmts ) .",
    "the location of the rich tile depends on the energy of the trigger particle and is determined from a look - up table , assuming that the trigger particle is an electron . if a spatial match is found , an ert trigger is issued .",
    "the data reported in this paper were collected during the 2006 rhic run .",
    "the data were recorded with the phenix detector using a mb trigger and the ert trigger .",
    "the ert energy threshold @xmath41 was set to 400 mev for majority of the run , but was raised to 600 mev towards the end of the run .",
    "a total of 855 million ert triggered events corresponding to 143 billion sampled mb events were analyzed .",
    "the corresponding integrated luminosity is @xmath42b@xmath43 .",
    "the analysis described here is very similar to the analysis of pairs from collisions published in  @xcite . a detailed description of electron identification as well as pair cuts can be found in  @xcite .",
    "events selected were required to have a reconstructed @xmath29-vertex within 30 cm of the nominal interaction point .",
    "charged tracks reconstructed using the dc and pc1 must pass stringent quality cuts and an explicit cut of @xmath44 0.2 gev/@xmath38 .",
    "the track is then selected as an electron if at least two photomultiplier tubes registered erenkov photons on the expected ring . additionally , electron tracks are required to have a good match to a cluster in emcal , and the energy of the cluster must satisfy the requirement @xmath45 0.5 , where @xmath1 is the momentum measured by the dcs .",
    "all electron tracks in a given event are combined to form pairs .",
    "we apply a minimum cut on the transverse mass of the pair , @xmath46 650 mev/@xmath38 . for the data taken using an ert trigger",
    ", we require that one of the tracks of the pair has a of at least 500 ( 700 ) mev / c exceeding the nominal energy threshold 400 ( or 600 ) mev of the trigger .",
    "these pairs can be subdivided into three groups : ( i ) signal pairs that we want to extract . in collisions",
    "these are mostly from the decays of pseudoscalar mesons , vector mesons , heavy flavor mesons .",
    "( ii ) combinatorial pairs , which are an undesired background .",
    "these result from the combinations of unrelated tracks in any given event , such as combining tracks that originate from two different decays .",
    "( iii ) correlated background pairs , which are also undesired , but these pairs do not result from random combinations of tracks .",
    "the combinatorial and correlated background pairs should be removed to extract the signal pairs .",
    "most of this is done via a statistical subtraction discussed in detail in section  [ sec : ee_spec ] .",
    "however , some of the correlated background can be removed through cuts on the pairs referred to as pair cuts .",
    "there are several sources of correlated pairs which are treated separately .",
    "one type of correlated pairs result from detector problems or ambiguities in the pattern recognition .",
    "the most important contributor are hadron tracks that are parallel to electron tracks in the rich .",
    "both tracks share the same ring and are identified as electrons .",
    "these pairs can be removed by placing a cut on the distance between the projections of both pairs to the rich focal plane .",
    "similar cuts to avoid detector overlaps are placed on all detector systems .",
    "another type of correlated pairs are the ones that originate from the photons that convert to pairs in the detector material in front of the tracking detectors , e.g. in the beryllium beam pipe ( 0.3% of a radiation length ( @xmath47 ) for the year 2006 ) .",
    "the tracks from these pairs get reconstructed with an incorrect momentum , because the tracking algorithm assumes that all tracks originate from the vertex and hence traverse the full magnetic field .",
    "this leads to an artificial opening angle of the pairs that is always oriented perpendicular to the axial magnetic field .",
    "a cut on the orientation of the opening angle removes these pairs from the sample .",
    "see  @xcite for a full description of the pair cuts .",
    "there are also correlated pairs that are from the same interaction , these are two tracks that share the same ancestry",
    ". these pairs can arise if there are two pairs in the event from the same parent meson , e.g. from a double dalitz decay of @xmath14 or @xmath48 or from a @xmath49 decay where both photons convert in the detector material . in this case , the cross - combination of electrons that do not result from the same real or virtual photon are possible .",
    "another source of these correlated pairs are hadrons from jet fragmentation , either within the same jet or in back - to - back jets , that decay into electron pairs .",
    "these pairs are part of the statistical subtraction discussed in the next section .      because the source of any electron or positron is unknown ,",
    "we combine all the electrons and positrons in a given event into like - sign ( ) foreground pairs , which is defined as sum of pairs of electrons and pairs of positrons , and pairs referred to as unlike - sign ( ) foreground pairs .",
    "the unlike - sign foreground spectrum measures the sum of signal , combinatorial and correlated background . for this analysis we use the like - sign pairs to determine the backgrounds .",
    "the like - sign subtraction method compared to the event - mixing technique has the advantage that it also accounts for the the correlated pair background that exists in the unlike - sign pairs . however , one first needs to correct the like - sign spectrum for the relative acceptance difference between and pairs .     relative acceptance correction @xmath50 defined as the ratio of to as defined in eq .",

    "however , this is not the case for pairs from production , in particular for powheg , the pair momentum distribution is much harder as compared to other generators .",
    "because the contribution is essentially fixed in the mass region between 1.0 to 2.0 gev/@xmath52 at low pair , a harder distribution can only be accommodated in the overall fit by reducing production , which we expect to account for all the seen variation between the three generators .",
    "additional differences in the rapidity and momentum distribution also contribute to the very model dependent extrapolations of the cross section in @xmath7 .",

    "this is evident by more than 400 @xmath85b difference between the obtained cross sections , which is more than 100% compared to the average value .",
    "we find a smaller variation for , which is less than 50% of the average cross section value .",
    "this variation is entirely due to the model dependence of production .",
