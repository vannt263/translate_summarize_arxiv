    "the experimental observation of the @xmath5 performed by the leps collaboration at spring-8  @xcite , which is motivated by diakonov _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , has paved the way for intensive studies on the exotic five - quark baryon states , also known as _ pentaquarks _ , experimentally  @xcite as well as theoretically  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence of the finding of the @xmath6 , the existence of other pentaquark baryons , such as the @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath0 , which have also been predicted theoretically , is anticipated .",
    "the na49  @xcite collaboration reported a signal for the pentaquark baryon @xmath0 , which was also predicted theoretically .",
    "the @xmath0 was found to have a mass of @xmath9 , a strangeness @xmath10 , and an isospin @xmath11 .",
    "it is characterized by its narrow decay width of @xmath12 , like that of the @xmath5 .",
    "however , we have thus far no concrete experimental evidence for its quantum numbers such as _ spin _ and _",
    "parity_.    as for the parity of the @xmath5 , a consensus has not been reached .",
    "for example , the chiral soliton model  @xcite , the diquark model  @xcite , the chiral potential model  @xcite , and constituent quark models with spin - flavor interactions  @xcite prefer a positive - parity for the @xmath5 whereas the qcd sum rule approach  @xcite   state from the two - point correlation function may reverse the parity of @xmath5 . ] and the quenched lattice qcd  @xcite have supported a negative - parity . in the meanwhile , various reactions for @xmath6 production  @xcite",
    "have been investigated , where the determination of the parity of @xmath5 has been emphasized . in many cases , the total cross - sections of the positive - parity @xmath5 production is typically about ten times larger than those of the negative - parity one .",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite evaluated the @xmath13 reactions , assuming the positive - parity @xmath0 and its spin @xmath14 .",
    "however , since the parity of the @xmath0 is not known yet , it is worthwhile studying the dynamics of @xmath0 production with two different parities taken into account .",
    "however , we note that negative results for the pentaquark baryons have emerged recently . especially , the clas collaboration at jefferson laboratory could not see any obvious evidence for the @xmath5 pentaquark , which was expected to have a peak at about @xmath15 mev in the reaction @xmath16  @xcite . moreover , the existence of an @xmath17 penataquark , such as the @xmath0 or the charmed pentaquark ( @xmath18 ) , has not been completely confirmed yet .    in the present work , nonetheless ,",
    "for the unclear status of the pentaquark , we want to investigate the @xmath0 production from the @xmath1 and the @xmath19 reactions . due to the exotic strangeness quantum number the @xmath0 has , the reaction process at the tree level becomes considerably simplified .",
    "this is a very specific feature of the process containing the exotic strangeness quantum number .",
    "we will follow the same framework as in refs .",
    "we assume that the spin of the @xmath0 is @xmath20  @xcite .",
    "then , we estimate the total and the differential cross - sections for the production of @xmath0 with positive and negative parities .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii , we define the effective lagrangians and construct the invariant amplitudes . in section iii , we present the numerical results for the total and the differential cross - sections for both positive- and negative - parity @xmath0 . finally , in section iv , we briefly summarize our discussions .",
    "we study the reactions @xmath1 and @xmath2 by using an effective lagrangian at the tree level of born diagrams .",
    "the reactions are schematically presented in fig .",
    "[ nmset00 ] , where we define the four momenta of each particle for the reactions by @xmath21 .",
    "there is no @xmath22-channel contribution because strangeness - two ( @xmath23 ) mesons do not exist . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , we do not include the @xmath24 coupling because it is forbidden in exact su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "hence , the interaction lagrangians can be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath0 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 denote the corresponding fields for the octet @xmath26 , the antidecuplet @xmath0 , the nucleon , the pseudo - scalar @xmath28 , and the vector @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the isospin operators are dropped because we treat the isospin states of the fields explicitly .",
    "we define @xmath30 for the positive - parity @xmath0 whereas @xmath31 for the negative - parity one .",
    "@xmath32 is also defined by @xmath33 for the vector meson @xmath29 .    ",
    "( left ) and @xmath4channels ( right ) for @xmath0 productions , width=377 ]    the values of the coupling constants @xmath34 and @xmath35 are taken from the new nijmegen potential  @xcite as @xmath36 and @xmath37 whereas we assume @xmath38 flavor symmetry for @xmath39 so that we obtain the relation @xmath40",
    "@xcite . employing the decay width @xmath41 mev and @xmath42 mev",
    ", we obtain @xmath43 for the positive ( negative ) parity . the remaining one , @xmath44 , is not known , which we will discuss in the next section",
    ".    the invariant scattering amplitude for @xmath1 can be written as @xmath45 where @xmath46 labels either the @xmath3-channel or the @xmath4-channel , and the corresponding momenta are @xmath47 and @xmath48 . for @xmath2",
    ", we have @xmath49 as indicated in eq .",
    "( [ amplitudes1 ] ) , the coupling constants are commonly factored out for the @xmath3- and the @xmath4-channels in the @xmath28 production .",
    "therefore , there is no ambiguity due to the sign of the coupling constants . on the contrary",
    ", there is such an ambiguity due to the unknown sign of @xmath44 in the case of @xmath50 production ,    since the baryon has an extended structure , we need to introduce a form factor .",
    "we employ the form factor  @xcite @xmath51 in such a way that the singularities appearing in the pole diagrams can be avoided . here , @xmath52 and @xmath53 stand for the cutoff parameter and the @xmath26 mass , respectively .",
    "we set the cutoff parameter @xmath54 as in ref .",
    "this value was used to reproduce the cross sections of @xmath55 . in order to verify the dependence of the form factor ,",
    "we consider also the three - dimensional form factor @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the three momentum of the external meson . as for the cutoff parameter , we set @xmath58 , which was deduced from the @xmath59 reaction  @xcite .",
