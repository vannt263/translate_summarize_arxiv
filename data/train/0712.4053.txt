    "the nature of electroweak symmetry breaking remains unknown at the present status of our knowledge for high energy physics . in the standard model ( sm ) , a scalar isospin doublet field , the higgs field ,",
    "is introduced to be responsible for spontaneous breakdown of electroweak gauge symmetry .",
    "its vacuum expectation value  ( vev ) triggers the symmetry breaking , so that it provides origins of masses of weak bosons via the higgs mechanism , and also does those of quarks and charged leptons via yukawa interaction .",
    "although the sm higgs sector is simple , the higgs sector could have a more complicated structure in the actual world .",
    "in particular , when the higgs sector would play an additional role to explain phenomena which the sm can not , it should necessarily be an extended form from the sm one . therefore , experimental detection of the higgs boson and precision measurements of its properties are extremely important not only to confirm our basic idea of electroweak symmetry breaking but also to determine details of the higgs sector and further to outline the structure of new physics .    in constructing an extended higgs sector , there are two important requirements from current experimental data .",
    "first of all , the data indicate that the electroweak rho parameter ( @xmath3 ) is very close to unity .",
    "second , flavor of quarks and charged leptons is ( approximately ) conserved in the neutral current . in the sm ,",
    "these two conditions are satisfied respectively by the custodial symmetry which ensures @xmath4 at the tree level , and by the glashow - iliopoulos - maiani  ( gim ) mechanism which prohibits the tree - level flavor changing neutral current  ( fcnc ) .",
    "needless to say that these experimental requirements must be respected in extended higgs models which would appear in the low energy effective theory of a more fundamental theory beyond the sm .",
    "extension of the sm higgs sector can be considered by including additional scalar isospin singlets , doublets and higher multiplets .",
    "it is known that additional singlets and doublets keep @xmath4 at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "radiative corrections can slightly deviate the rho parameter from unity , corresponding to explicit violation of the custodial symmetry in the dynamics in the loop . on the other hand , extension with higher multiplets such as triplets",
    "is usually problematic , predicting the rho parameter to be explicitly different from unity already at the tree level  @xcite .",
    "one way to avoid this problem is to make a fine - tuning on the size of vacuum expectation values of the triplet fields ; i.e. , to set tiny values on them .",
    "another possibility is to impose the custodial symmetry to the higgs sector , so that the rho parameter is predicted to be unity at the tree level . in 1985 georgi and machacek proposed such a model with one real triplet ( @xmath5=0 ) and one complex triplet ( @xmath5=2 ) in addition to the higgs doublet  @xcite .",
    "chanowitz and golden have explicitly constructed the higgs potential of this model  @xcite ; i.e. , imposing the custodial @xmath6 symmetry to the potential , vevs of all the isospin triplets become common , and then the tree - level value of the rho parameter is unity .",
    "they also have shown that the quantum correction from the scalar sector is stabilized by such a global symmetry , so that the rho parameter is corrected at the loop level only due to explicit @xmath6 violation in the other sectors such as hypercharge interaction and yukawa interaction , just like in the sm .",
    "several phenomenological studies have been done on this model in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "generally in extended higgs models , there are many free parameters in the higgs potential , which spoil predictive power of the model .",
    "hence , it is important to clarify allowed regions in the parameter space not only by using current experimental data but also by investigating theoretical consistencies such as perturbative unitarity  @xcite , vacuum stability and triviality  @xcite .",
    "this kind of study has been often developed to constrain parameters of the higgs sector in the context of the two - higgs - doublet model  @xcite , and in a specific triplet model  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study bounds on higgs boson masses from perturbative unitarity in the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model .",
    "the higgs potential respects the global @xmath0 symmetry , so that the custodial @xmath6 symmetry remains after the electroweak symmetry breaking ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "there are ten physical scalar states , which can be expressed by a @xmath6 5-plet @xmath8 , a 3-plet @xmath9 and two singlets @xmath10 and @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "the scalar components in the same multiplet are degenerate in mass at the tree level . in the higgs potential of the gm model",
    ", explicit @xmath12 violation can only appear in the trilinear scalar interaction , but they must be forbidden to avoid excessive magnitudes for masses of neutrinos . neglecting such terms by imposing the @xmath12 symmetry , all higgs",
    "boson masses in this model are described in terms of the vev , the mixing angles and the dimension - less coupling constants @xmath13 in the higgs potential .",
    "this situation is somewhat similar to the two - higgs - doublet model with the discrete @xmath12 symmetry  @xcite , in which perturbative unitarity gives upper bounds on all the higgs boson masses  @xcite .    in our analysis , all possible two - body elastic scattering channels ( 91-channels )",
    "are taken into account to evaluate the s - wave amplitude matrix in the gm model .",
    "constraints on the higgs parameters are obtained by imposing the condition of partial wave unitarity on the eigenmatrix of the s - wave amplitude .",
    "masses of all scalar bosons turn out to be bounded from above , some of which receive much stronger bounds as compared to that in the sm ( 712 gev )",
    ". in particular , the mass of at least one of the charged higgs bosons should be less than about 400 gev .",
    "at least one of the neutral higgs boson is lighter than 322 gev .",
    "furthermore , the upper bound of the lightest scalar boson , whatever it would be , can be about 269 gev .",
    "we also find that by using the experimental constraints from @xmath14 results  @xcite , the combined upper bound for the lightest higgs boson is lower than 269 gev , depending on what the lighest is . therefore , the model can be well testable at current and future collider experiments .    in sec .  2 , a brief review of the gm model is given .",
    "the transition matrix for two - body elastic scatterings is calculated in the high - energy limit , and its eigenmatrix is obtained in sec .  3 .",
    "in sec .  4 , the condition of s - wave unitarity is imposed for the eigenmatrix of the transition matrix , and bounds on the higgs boson masses are evaluated .",

    "after electroweak symmetry breaking , the custodial @xmath6 symmetry remains in the higgs sector @xmath33 , by which the real and complex triplets have the same vev , @xmath34 .",

    "the vevs are constrained as @xmath35 , where @xmath36 gev .",
    "therefore , differently from usual triplet models , @xmath37 can be of order 100 gev in this model without explicit inconsistency with the experimental value of the rho parameter .",

    "the model is allowed to have the mass terms for the neutrinos by assigning of lepton number @xmath43 to the complex triplet field , i(h_)_ab_la^tc_2_lb+h.c . , where @xmath44 .",
    "in order to generate the tiny neutrino masses the yukawa coupling @xmath45 should be fine - tuned to be very small as @xmath46 for the triplet vev of order 100 gev . since we would like to avoid such fine tuning with respect to the neutrino masses",
    ", we require the discrete @xmath12 symmetry in the higgs potential and prohibit the last two terms in eq.([potential ] ) .",

    "however numerical analysis shows that the actual upper bound is a few decade gev greater .",
    "this excess comes from some delicate cancellation in eq.([x1 ] ) .",
    "when we impose the experimental data from @xmath61 which give the constraint on the combination of @xmath64 and @xmath38  @xcite , the allowed region is further limited in the dark shadowed regions .",
    "the upper bounds on @xmath64 and @xmath170 do not change , but the remained allowed region is in the vicinity of @xmath178 .    in fig .",
    "1(b ) we can see that the upper bound on @xmath57 is about 710 gev , which is almost the same as that on the mass of the sm higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "larger values of @xmath57 are allowed for smaller values of @xmath56 and @xmath185 as well as smaller @xmath170 and @xmath186 values .",
    "for instance , taking the limit @xmath187 and @xmath188 , we obtain @xmath189 ( @xmath190 gev ) in the condition @xmath191 .",
    "the mass bound for another singlet @xmath192 can be obtained by replacing @xmath57 with @xmath58 and @xmath56 with @xmath193 , which can be seen from eqs.([lambda1])-([lambda3 ] ) . consequently the allowed regions in the @xmath64 - @xmath58 plane are given by the same as in fig .",
    "we find that contrary to the result in fig .",
    "1(a ) there is only few difference in the case where we include the @xmath61 data .",
    "the allowed region in the @xmath194 - @xmath58 plane in fig .",
    "1(c ) is symmetrical about the line of @xmath195 .",
    "it is notable that at least one singlet receives very strict constraint from perturbative unitarity .",
    "the mass of lighter singlet , either @xmath196 or @xmath192 , is bounded from above by 322 gev . in analytic calculation , this upper bound is obtained as @xmath197 ( @xmath198 gev ) from @xmath174 .    in the following ,",
    "we evaluate the upper bound on @xmath199 @xmath200 $ ] .",
    "we start from the case in which the constraints from the @xmath14 results are switched off . when the 3-plet is the lightest , we obtain the upper bound on @xmath201 as m_lightest < 269  gev , [ lightest ] which is considerably lower than that of the sm higgs boson , 712 gev .",
    "this condition comes from the constraints @xmath191 and @xmath202 .",
    "similar analysis has been done for @xmath203 and @xmath58 in order , and the same bound as in eq.([lightest ] ) is derived for each case .",
    "when @xmath204 gev , all the masses are degenerate in mass ( @xmath205 ) .",
    "the situation turns out to be quite similar to the situation of the two - higgs - doublet model with the discrete symmetry , where the lightest of all higgs masses are bounded at 410 gev  @xcite . in the case of the gm model",
    "the number of the two - body states is greater than that in the two - higgs - doublet model .",
    "( the neutral two body states are 14 channels in the two - higgs - doublet model and 25 channels in the gm model . )",
    "thereby we have obtained the stronger bounds than the two - higgs - doublet model . finally , when we take into account the @xmath14 results  @xcite , the angle @xmath38 is more limited for smaller values of @xmath64 .",
    "consequently , the combined upper bound on @xmath199 becomes lower than 269 gev .",
    "depending on what the lightest is , the combined upper bound turns out to be about 249 gev ( 176 gev ) when @xmath64 , @xmath57 or @xmath58 ( @xmath170 ) is the lightest .",
    "we have not included the lep direct search results , which give the lower bound @xmath206 gev in the sm  @xcite . in the gm model",
    "similar lower mass bounds can be obtained for neutral higgs bosons but depending on the mixing angles , which would slightly affect the upper bounds by using the results in figs .",
    "1(a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) .",
    "we have taken into account only the @xmath61 result as the experimental constraint  @xcite , because this constraint drastically changes the bound in the @xmath64-@xmath170 plane and also that on @xmath207 .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed unitarity constraints on the higgs boson masses in the gm model , which includes a real and a complex isospin triplet fields but predicts @xmath4 at tree level .",
    "all possible two - body elastic - scattering channels ( 91 channels ) have been taken into account to construct the s - wave amplitude matrix in the high energy limit .",
    "the condition of s - wave unitarity in eq.([puconstraint ] ) has been applied to the eigenmatrix .",
    "we have found that all the higgs bosons receive their masses from the vev under the discrete @xmath12 symmetry , so that all the masses can be bounded from above by the condition of parturbative unitarity . in particular ,",
    "the upper bound on the mass of the @xmath6 3-plet is about @xmath208 lower than that on the sm higgs boson mass ( 712 gev ) .",
    "hence at least one of the singly - charged higgs boson masses is bounded from above at about 400 gev .",
    "the mass of the lighter @xmath6 singlet scalar state , either @xmath209 or @xmath210 , turns out to be bounded from above by about 300 gev .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the lightest higgs boson among the 5-plet , the 3-plet and the two singlet states , whatever it would be , receives very strong constraint from above ; i.e. , @xmath211 gev . the point of the parameter space at which @xmath199 takes its maximum value corresponds to that where all the mass parameters are degenerate .",
    "the combined upper bound with the @xmath14 results becomes about 150 gev ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "therefore , the model turns out to be well testable at collider experiments . the @xmath6 5-plet and 3-plet have the doubly- and singly - charged states , so that the distinctive phenomenological features of this model should also appear in physics of charged higgs bosons .",
    "detailed phenomenological features will be discussed elsewhere .    in the analysis above ,",
    "we have considered the higgs potential with the @xmath12 symmetry , neglecting the trilinear scalar terms of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the imposition of the @xmath12 symmetry in our analysis would be justified to avoid large excess of the neutrino masses .",
    "when we do not respect the @xmath12 symmetry , the upper bounds in above results become relaxed according to the scales of @xmath39 and @xmath40 which have linear mass dimension . unless @xmath39 and @xmath40 are substantially larger than @xmath212(100 ) gev , our results above can sufficiently be applied by small relaxation .",
    "finally , in this paper , we have employed partial wave unitarity to constrain parameters of the gm model at the tree level . a more detailed study with the radiative effects such as vacuum stability or triviality",
    "might give more strict bounds on the higgs boson masses in this model .",
