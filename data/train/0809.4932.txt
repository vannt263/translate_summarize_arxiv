    "layered high @xmath0 superconductors ( htscs ) represent a stack of alternating superconducting and insulating layers , which form a system of ijjs.@xcite coupling between layers leads to the multiple branch structure with hysteresis in the ivc of such stack . in the system ,",
    "hysteretic behavior is different from the case of single josephson junction .",
    "for example , the value of return current depends on from which branch the system has returned to the zero voltage state . in addition , it has been recently predicted that the system shows a new feature called as breakpoint region ( bpr ) , on the ivc.@xcite the bpr is characterized by the breakpoint current ( bpc ) @xmath1 and transition current @xmath2 .",
    "the former is a resonance point , at which the longitudinal plasma wave ( lpw ) is created in the stack with given number and with given distribution of the rotating and oscillating ijjs , while the latter corresponds to the jumping point from the given branch to the another one ( see fig .",
    "[ simulated](a ) ) .",
    "however , to our knowledge no precise experiment to observe the bpr has been carried out so far .",
    "furthermore , the problem to determine the value of the coupling parameter in the stack of the ijjs also attracts much interest , but there are still many questions concerning this topic . the new opportunity to make this problem clear gives the investigation of the breakpoint in the current - voltage characteristics and temperature dependence of the breakpoint current .    in this paper",
    "we present the experimental observation of the bpr as resulting from the longitudinal plasma excitation in ijjs .",
    "physical properties of the ijjs in htsc might be understood in the framework of the capacitively coupled josephson junction ( ccjj ) model .",

    "the ccjj+dc model is different from the ccjj model by the last term on the right hand side .",

    "the josephson oscillations , which frequency is determined by the voltage value , excite the lpw by their periodical actions , so that at @xmath25 the parametric resonance is realized and the lpw with definite wave number is created .",
    "@xcite then , the wave number depends on the number of junctions in the stack , boundary conditions , dissipation and coupling parameters .",
    "using maxwell equations the charge density @xmath26 on the superconducting layer @xmath6 can be expressed by the voltages @xmath27 and @xmath28 in the neighbor insulating layers .",
    "solution of the system of dynamical equations for the gauge - invariant phase differences between s - layers gives us the voltages @xmath27 in all junctions in the stack , and it allows us to investigate the time dependence of the charge on each s - layer .",
