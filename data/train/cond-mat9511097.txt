    "on the other hand , semiflexible filaments like actin are much more stretched and strongly interact with each other even at quite low concentrations ( figure  [ sem ] ) . as the scattering vector @xmath25 in our experiments is large enough in magnitude to resolve single actin filaments ( see eq .",

    "( [ res ] ) . in the opposite limit ",
    "i.e.  for local segment motion strictly transverse with respect to the mean contour  averaging over the different orientations is performed after calculating the anisotropic dynamic structure factor for an individual macromolecule , whose mean orientation and center of mass position is assumed to be fixed in space and time . in our case",
    "this is realized by the time scale separation mentioned above and by the fact that the macromolecules are imbedded in a network .",
    "it is found that the resulting dynamic structure factor is very similar to the stretched exponential form obtained by neglecting the anisotropy of the segment motion in the averaging procedure .",
    "we propose to use the stretched exponential form also in the intermediate regime , where the segment motion is neither strictly transverse nor isotropic .",
    "this allows for a simple fit to the experimental data and has the advantage that the relevant physical mechanisms are not obscured by complicated numerical analysis .",
    "but , as a consequence of the approximations made , the numerical value of the prefactor in the exponential of eq .",
    "( [ res ] ) should be taken with some precaution .",
    "unfortunately , the value obtained for the persistence length by eq .",

    "in addition the actual prefactor in the scaling law , eq .",
    "( [ mes ] ) , for @xmath28 is not known .",
    "hence the method described here is not capable of producing very accurate absolute values for the bending modulus so far . on the other hand ,",
    "relative changes in the stiffness , which may be caused by diverse chemical or physical mechanisms are readily detected .",

    "the presence of torsional modes may affect the dynamic structure factor in two ways : first , they cause  crankshaft \" motions of bent chains and thus provide an additional mechanism contributing to the time decay of the correlation function .",
    "second , they could lead to a scale dependent renormalized bending stiffness of actin as was recently observed for the railway track model @xcite . though we did not see any systematic @xmath49dependence of the bending modulus with the qels method , such effects may well occur in other @xmath49regimes .",
    "the more  exotic \" motions of actin are of great biological interest , since they could play an active role in the conformational changes of the actin - myosin - complex during atp - cleavage .",
    "it is hoped that future qels studies with enhanced precision and larger ranges of scattering vectors and measurement times will help to clarify this important point .",
