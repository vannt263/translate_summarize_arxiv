    "the purpose of the lipschitz truncation technique is to approximate a sobolev function  @xmath5 by @xmath6-lipschitz functions  @xmath7 that coincide with  @xmath8 up to a set of small measure .",
    "the functions @xmath7 are constructed non - linearly by modifying  @xmath8 on the level set of the hardy - littlewood maximal function of the gradient  @xmath9 .",
    "this idea goes back to acerbi and fusco@xcite .",
    "lipschitz truncations are used in various areas of analysis : calculus of variations , in the existence theory of partial differential equations , and in the regularity theory .",
    "we refer to  ref .",
    "@xcite for a longer list of references .",
    "we are interested in the motion of incompressible fluids .",
    "the balance of momentum reads in the stationary case as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the velocity , @xmath12 denotes the convective term , @xmath13 is the stress deviator , @xmath14 the pressure , and @xmath15 is the external force . in order to prescribe the properties of a special fluid one needs a constitutive law which relates @xmath13 and the symmetric gradient @xmath16 of the velocity field .",
    "the most common model for non - newtonian fluids is@xcite @xmath17 where @xmath18 and @xmath1 .",
    "such fluids are sometimes called generalized newtonian fluids . from the mathematical point of view",
    "this problem was firstly investigated by ladyzhenskaya@xcite and lions@xcite in the late sixties .",
    "the existence of a weak solution @xmath19 to ( [ 0.1])-([0.2 ] ) is today quite standard provided @xmath20 . here",
    "the solution is an admissible test function to the weak equation and one can directly apply the monotone operator theory . for smaller values of @xmath21 the lipschitz truncation",
    "was firstly used in the fluid context in ref .",
    "@xcite , the existence of a weak solution was shown provided @xmath22 .",
    "the idea is to rewrite @xmath23 as @xmath24 ( using @xmath25 ) and apply the lipschitz truncation to our test function .",
    "the technique was improved in ref .",
    "@xcite , where also electro - rheological fluids were considered . in this paper",
    "the following estimate is shown : @xmath26 where @xmath27 for a suitable sequence @xmath28 .",
    "this implies the convergence @xmath29 ( for @xmath28 ) in @xmath30 which does not follow from the results of acerbi - fusco@xcite .    for the system ( [ 0.1 ] )",
    "it is often convenient to work with the so called pressure free formulation .",
    "this is achieved by the use of solenoidal ( i.e. divergence - free ) test functions , since they are orthogonal to the pressure gradient .",
    "the problem of the standard lipschitz truncation is , that it does not preserve the solenoidal property .",
    "the easiest strategy to overcome this deficit is to correct the functions @xmath2 by means of the operator .",
    "this operator works nice in the uniform convex setting , i.e. on @xmath31 with @xmath1 .",
    "however , it can not be used in the non - uniform convex setting , e.g. @xmath32 , @xmath33 or @xmath34 with @xmath35 , since the correction is a singular integral operator .",
    "so in the limit cases the -corrected lipschitz truncation loses some of its important fine properties .",
    "this is particular the case in the setting of prandtl - eyring fluids@xcite , where the constitutive relation reads as @xmath36 to overcome these problems one needs a solenoidal lipschitz truncation .",
    "therefore in ref .",
    "@xcite a truncation method was developed which allows to approximate @xmath37 by a solenoidal lipschitz function @xmath2 without losing the fine properties of the truncation .",
    "now , let us turn to the parabolic problem : the balance of momentum reads as @xmath38 and all involved quantities are defined on the parabolic cube @xmath39 . here",
    "the situation is much more delicate since the distributional time derivative @xmath40 interacts with the pressure which also only exists in the sense of distributions . in ref .  @xcite it is shown how to get a weak solution to ( [ 0.4 ] ) provided @xmath22",
    "this is based on a parabolic lipschitz truncation and a deep understanding of the pressure .",
    "further results about parabolic lipschitz truncation are due to kinnunen - lewis@xcite . in addition to the properties one needs in the stationary",
    "setting we need to know what happens with the term @xmath41 ( which appears if one tests the equation with the truncated function @xmath2 ) . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that @xmath42 where @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "the main ingredients are a parabolic -inequality and a suitable scaling .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a lipschitz truncation @xmath2 for a function @xmath43 which , in addition to the properties in refs .",
    "@xcite , is also solenoidal .",
    "the main motivation for doing so , is to develop an existence theory for ( non - stationary ) generalized newtonian fluids which completely avoids the appearance of the pressure ( note that this can not be done by a -correction ) .",
    "this heavily simplifies the existence proof for generalized newtonian fluids from ref .",
    "@xcite , see section  [ sec : appl ] .",
    "we expect that our approach will be useful in the investigation of electro - rheological fluids@xcite and prandtl - eyring fluids@xcite . in this situations",
    "it is not possible to reconstruct the pressure in the right spaces .",
    "so the standard lipschitz truncation approach will fail .",
    "in this paper we will construct a solenoidal lipschitz truncation .",
    "let @xmath44 be a function with @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the space of compactly supported , smooth , solenoidal function .",
    "then there is a function @xmath2 with roughly the following properties ( see theorem  [ thm : ulwhole ] for a precise formulation ) .",
    "1 .   @xmath47 with @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "2 .   @xmath50 a.e .",
    "outside a suitable set @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath27 if @xmath28 .",
    "let us explain the rough ideas of the construction and some difficulties : we start with the open set @xmath51 , where the maximal functions of @xmath53 or @xmath54 is bigger than @xmath6 . consider a whitney decomposition of @xmath51 into cubes @xmath55 with a special parabolic scaling",
    "let @xmath56 be a subordinate partition of unity .",
    "on @xmath57 the gradient @xmath58 is already bounded , so we need to change the function only on @xmath51 . in refs .",
    "@xcite this is done via the following construction with mean values @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 of course @xmath2 is not solenoidal in general .",
    "so the first idea is to set @xmath61 where @xmath62 is a local linear approximation .",
    "this approach is very useful in the stationary context .",
    "it simplifies the construction of a solenoidal lipschitz truncation from ref .",
    "@xcite , which was based on local projections .",
    "we present this new approach in section  [ sec : sol_stat ] .",
    "however in the non - stationary situation we are confronted with the following problem : the @xmath33-estimates for @xmath58 require a parabolic inequality .",
    "this needs an information about the distributional time - derivative which is connected to the pressure via the equation of motion ( see ( [ 0.4 ] ) ) .",
    "it is not enough to control @xmath63 as a functional on the solenoidal test - functions .",
    "so the construction above leads to a solenoidal lipschitz truncation where its time derivative still needs information about the pressure and is therefore not very useful .",
    "the main problem in our construction is to overcome this difficulty which needs a deep understanding of the equation , especially the properties of the time derivative .",
    "the new solenoidal lipschitz truncation can be found in section  [ sec : soltrunc ] . in section  [ sec : appl ] we revisit the existence proof for non - stationary motion of generalized newtonian fluids in order to present how useful this approximation is .",
    "in this section we examine solenoidal functions , whose time derivative is only well defined via the duality with solenoidal test functions .",
    "let @xmath64 be a space time cylinder .",
    "let @xmath65 and @xmath66 satisfy @xmath67 where we use the subscript @xmath68 to denote the subspace of solenoidal functions .",
    "the goal of this section is to construct a solenoidal truncation @xmath2 of @xmath3 which preserves the properties of the truncation in refs .",
    "@xcite . in these papers ,",
    "equation   is valid for all @xmath69 , so one has more control of the time derivative  @xmath70 .",
    "this extra control allows to derive a parabolic estimate for @xmath3 in terms of @xmath71 and @xmath54 , see theorem  b.1 of ref .",
    "@xcite .    in our situation we are confronted with the problem , that the time derivative  @xmath70 is only defined as a functional on solenoidal test functions .",
    "therefore , we have not enough control of  @xmath70 to derive a parabolic estimate .",
    "this problem was overcome in ref .",
    "@xcite by introducing a pressure in  .",
    "this pressure splits into a pressure related to  @xmath54 and a time derivative of a harmonic pressure related to @xmath63 .",
    "then the sum of @xmath3 and the harmonic pressure solves a system of the form   for all test functions  @xmath72 . the truncation technique",
    "is then applied to this sum .",
    "we want to avoid the introduction of the pressure , since it is very inflexible and complicates the application of the truncation method .",
    "because @xmath3 and @xmath73 are both solenoidal in  , they can both be written as the curl of a vector field .",
    "this will allow us to rewrite   as a system that is valid for all functions .",
    "since the definition of the curl operator depends on the dimension , we will restrict ourselves in the following for simplicity to the case  @xmath74 .",
    "let us be more precise .",
    "first we extend our function @xmath3 in a suitable way on the whole space and then apply the inverse curl operator .",
    "let @xmath75 with@xmath76 , where @xmath77 is a ball .",
    "here we use the convention that @xmath78 is the scaled ball with the same center ( same for cylinders ) .",
    "let @xmath79 denote the annulus @xmath80 . then according to refs .",
    "@xcite there exists a operator @xmath81 from is the subspace of @xmath82 whose elements have mean value zero . ]",
    "@xmath83 which is bounded from @xmath84 for all @xmath85 such that @xmath86 .",
    "define @xmath87 then @xmath88 on @xmath89 and @xmath90 , so we can extend @xmath91 by zero in space to @xmath92 .",
    "since @xmath93 on @xmath94 , we have @xmath95    on the space @xmath96 with @xmath97 we define the inverse curl operator @xmath98 by @xmath99 the definition is correct , as in the sense of distributions @xmath100 where we used @xmath101 in the last step .",
    "moreover , @xmath102 since @xmath103 is a singular integral operator , we have @xmath104 for @xmath105 .",
    "analogously , we have @xmath106 for @xmath105 .",
    "now , we define pointwise in time @xmath107 overall , we get the following lemma .    [",
    "lem : defw ] we have @xmath108 and @xmath109 for @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath105 .",
    "let us derive from   the equation for @xmath112 .",
    "for @xmath113 we have @xmath114 we use @xmath115 and partial integration to get @xmath116 now , because @xmath117 and @xmath118 we gain @xmath119 for every @xmath120 .",
    "we can rewrite this as @xmath121 with @xmath122 pointwise .",
    "in particular , in the sense of distributions we have @xmath123 .",
    "so in passing from @xmath3 to @xmath112 we got a system valid for all test functions  @xmath124 .",
