    "quantum hall system is a system of two dimensional electrons in strong perpendicular magnetic field , and is realized in semiconductors .",
    "the system shows intriguing physical phenomena such as the integer hall effect and the fractional hall effect .",
    "the hall conductance agrees with @xmath1 or @xmath2 in finite parameter regions , hence , quantum hall effect is used as a standard of resistance and precise determination of the fine structure constant provided the above relations are exact.it is a theoretical issue to find out if the above relations are exact or not .",
    "the fractional hall effect shows that the ground state of many electron systems of certain fractional filling is unique and is a quantum liquid of having large energy gap .",
    "the energy gap vanishes and the ground state has an enormous degeneracy in the absence of interactions . to find the mechanism of forming this kind of incompressible liquid by interactions is another issue for the theorists .",
    "von neumann lattice is a spatial lattice which is defined from a complete set of coherent states , i.e. , eigenstates of annihilation operator .",
    "von neumann lattice representation preserves a spatial symmetry in lattice form and is useful in studying the above problems .",
    "we have used it for studying the quantum hall systems and for solving the quantum hall dynamics.the proof of the integer hall effect and others have been given .",
    "@xcite in quantum hall system , it is convenient to decompose the electron coordinates ( x , y ) into two sets of variables , guiding center variables and relative coordinates variables .",
    "guiding center variables ( x , y ) stand for the center coordinates of cyclotron motion and their commutation relation becomes an imaginary number that is inversely proportional to the external magnetic field .",
    "a minimum complete set of coherent states in this space has discrete complex eigenvalues and is known as von neumann lattice representation .",
    "relative coordinates ( @xmath3 ) satisfy the equivalent commutation relation and the one body free hamiltonian is proportional to the summation of squares of relative coordinates .",
    "hence the electron has a discrete eigenvalue of energy .",
    "each energy level is known as landau level and its degeneracy is specified by the center variables . from commutation relation , the degeneracy per area is proportional to the magnetic field .",
    "the coherent states are defined by @xmath4 where @xmath5 are integers and @xmath6 are complex numbers which satisfy @xmath7=1 $ ] and @xmath8 is a point on the lattice site in the complex plane ; an area of the unit cell is @xmath9 .",
    "we call this lattice the magnetic von neumann lattice . with a spacing @xmath10 , the completeness of the set @xmath11 is ensured .",
    "@xcite fourier transformed states denoted by @xmath12 are orthogonal , that is , @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is a vector with integer values and @xmath15 is a momentum in the brillouin zone ( bz ) , that is , @xmath16 .",
    "the function @xmath17 is calculated by using the poisson resummation formula as follows : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a theta function and the moduli of the von neumann lattice is defined by @xmath20 .",
    "the magnetic von neumann lattice is parameterized by @xmath21 . to indicate the dependence on @xmath21",
    ", we sometimes use a notation such as @xmath22 . for @xmath23 ,",
    "the von neumann lattice becomes a square lattice .",
    "for @xmath24 , it becomes a triangular lattice .",
    "some properties of the above functions are presented in references .whereas @xmath17 satisfies the periodic boundary condition , @xmath25 obeys a nontrivial boundary condition @xmath26 where @xmath27 .",
    "we can define the orthogonal state which is normalized with @xmath28-function as follows : @xmath29    it should be noted that the state @xmath30 is a null state , that is , @xmath31 , because @xmath32 .    the hibert space of one - particle states is also spanned by the state @xmath33 .",
    "we call the state @xmath33 the momentum state of the von neumann lattice .",
    "the wave function of the state @xmath33 in the spatial coordinate space is given in references .",
    "the probability density @xmath34 is invariant under the translation @xmath35 .",
    "thus , the momentum state is an extended state .      in the preceding section",
    "we obtain one - particle states based on the von neumann lattice , that is , the coherent state @xmath36 and the momentum state @xmath37 .now we develop the field theoretical formalism based on the momentum state . from now on ,",
    "we denote @xmath33 as @xmath38 . we expand the electron field operator in the form",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 satisfies the anti - commutation relation @xmath41 and the same boundary condition as @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 and @xmath44 are creation and annihilation operators which operate on the many - body states .",
    "the free hamiltonian is given by @xmath45 the density and current operators in the momentum space @xmath46 become @xmath47 here , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 .",
    "the explicit form of @xmath50 and @xmath51 are given in references .",
    "the free hamiltonian @xmath52 is diagonal in the above basis .",
    "however , the density operator is not diagonal with respect to the landau level index .",
    "this basis , which we call the energy basis , is convenient to describe the energy spectrum of the system . in another basis",
    ", @xmath52 is not diagonal and the density operator is diagonal .",
    "this basis , which we call the current basis , is convenient to describe the ward - takahashi identity and the topological formula of hall conductance .",
    "there is no basis in which both the hamiltonian and the density are diagonal .",
    "this is one of peculiar features in a magnetic field .",
    "the current basis is constructed as follows . using a unitary operator",
    ", we can diagonalize the density operator in the landau level indices .",
    "we define the unitary operator @xmath53 by introducing a unitary transformed operator @xmath54 , the density operator is written in the diagonal form and the current operator becomes a simple form : @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 satisfy the anti - commutation relation and boundary condition .",
    "here we show the ward - takahashi identity and the topological formula of hall conductance using the current basis .",
    "the one - particle irreducible vertex part @xmath58 is connected with the full propagator by the ward - takahashi identity .",
    "the identity has crucial roles in the following derivation of the topological formula of hall conductance .",
    "the ward - takahashi identity in this case becomes @xmath59 in a theory without a magnetic field , ward - takahashi identity gives a relation that the state of the dispersion @xmath60 moves with the velocity @xmath61 .",
    "however in a magnetic field , we can not diagonalize both the current and the energy simultaneously .",
    "therefore , the ward - takahashi identity does not imply the relation .    in a gap region",
    ", it was proven that the hall conductance is obtained not only from the retarded product of the current correlation function ( kubo formula ) , but also from the time - ordered product of it . from the time - ordered product of the current correlation function , the hall conductance is given by the slope of @xmath62 at the origin and is written as @xmath63 if the derivative @xmath64 acts on the vertex with the external line attached , its contribution becomes zero owing to the epsilon tensor .",
    "therefore , the case that the derivative acts on the bare propagator is survived .    by the ward - takahashi identity , @xmath65 is written as a topologically invariant expression of the full propagator : @xmath66 here , the trace is taken over the landau level index and the @xmath67 integral is a contour integral on a closed path .",
    "thus , we denote @xmath68 as the integration range .",
    "the integral @xmath69 gives a integer value under general assumptions and in fact counts the number or landau bands bellow the fermi energy .",
    "thus , the hall conductance is proved to be a integer times @xmath70 .",
    "the impurities and interactions dot not modify the value of the @xmath65 if the fermi energy is located in the gap region or in the localized state region .",
    "we propose a new mean field theory based on the flux state on von neumann lattices in this section .",
    "the dynamical flux which is generated by interactions plays an important role in our mean field theory .",
    "dynamics is described by a lattice hamiltonian , which is due to the external magnetic field , and by the induced magnetic flux due to interaction , although the original electrons are defined on the continuum space .",
    "consequently , our mean field hamiltonian is close to the hofstadter hamiltonian , which is a tight - binding model with uniform constant flux . for this reason",
    "there are similarities between their solutions .    due to the two scales of periodicity , the hofstadter hamiltonian exhibits interesting structure as is seen in figure .",
    "@xcite the largest gap exists along a line @xmath71 with a unit of flux @xmath72 .",
    "the ground state energy becomes minimum also with this flux .",
    "these facts may suggest that the hofstadter problem has some connection with the fractional hall effect .",
    "we pursue a mean field theory of the condensed flux states in the quantum hall system and point out that the hofstadter problem is actually connected with the fractional hall effect .",
    "@xmath73from the induced magnetic field , new landau levels are formed .",
    "if integer number of these landau levels are filled completely , the integer quantum hall effect occurs .",
    "the ground state has a large energy gap and is stable against perturbations , just as in the case of the ordinary integer quantum hall effect .",
    "we identify them as fractional quantum hall states .",
    "we postulate , in the quantum hall system of the filling factor @xmath74 , the induced flux per plaquette and magnetic field of the following magnitudes : @xmath75 where @xmath74 is the filling factor measured with the external magnetic field .",
    "we obtain a self - consistent solution with this flux .",
    "then the integer quantum hall effect due to the induced magnetic field could occur just at the filling factor @xmath74 , because the density satisfies the integer hall effect condition , @xmath76 the ground state has a large energy gap , generally .    at the half - filling @xmath77",
    ", the half - flux @xmath78 is induced .",
    "we first study the state of @xmath77 , and next the states of @xmath79 . at @xmath80 ,",
    "the band structure is that of a massless dirac field and has doubling symmetry .",
    "when an even number of landau levels of the effective magnetic field , @xmath81 , is filled , ground states have large energy gaps .",
    "this occurs if the condition of the density , @xmath82 is satisfied .",
    "the factor of 2 on the left - hand side is due to the doubling of states and will be discussed later .",
    "we study these states in detail based on the von neumann lattice representation .",
    "the action and density operator show that there is an effective magnetic field in the momentum space .",
    "the total flux in the momentum space is in fact a unit flux . in the thermodynamic limit , in which the density in space is finite",
    ", the density in momentum space is infinite .",
    "consequently , it is possible to make this phase factor disappear using a singular gauge transformation in the momentum space with infinitesimally small coupling .",
    "we make a singular gauge transformation of the field in the momentum space and we have the commutation relation and the charge density .    by a chern - simons gauge theory in momentum space",
    ", the gauge transformation is realized . here",
    ", the coupling constant @xmath83 is infinitesimally small , and hence fluctuations of the chern - simons gauge field have a small effect , and we ignore them .",
    "the most important part in the action in the coordinate representation is obtained and the corresponding hamiltonian in the lowest landau level space is given by @xmath84 where @xmath85 is zero - th order modified bessel function .",
    "we study a mean field solution of this hamiltonian .",
    "\\(i ) half - filled case , @xmath77    at half - filling @xmath77 , the system has a half flux , @xmath80 .",
    "the system , then , is described equivalently with the two - component dirac field by combining the field at even sites with that at odd sites .",
    "we obtained self - consistent solutions numerically .",
    "as is expected , the spectrum has two minima and two zeros corresponding to doubling of states .    around the minima ,",
    "the energy eigenvalue is approximated as , @xmath86 .",
    "the @xmath87 in eq.(21 ) is the effective mass , and is computed numerically : @xmath88    the @xmath77 mean field hamiltonian is invariant under a kind of parity , @xmath89 , and anti - commutes with a chiral transformation , @xmath90 . if the parity is not broken spontaneously , there is a degeneracy due to the parity doublet .",
    "the doubling of the states also appears at @xmath91 and plays an important role when we discuss the states away from @xmath77 in the next part .",
    "when an additional vector potential with the same gauge , @xmath92 , is added , the hamiltonian satisfies the properties under the above transformations , and doubling due to the parity doublet also appears .",
    "thus , the factor of 2 is necessary in eq.(19 ) and leads the principal series at @xmath79 to have the maximum energy gap .",
    "\\(ii ) @xmath93    if the filling factor , @xmath74 , is slightly away from 1/2 , the total system can be regarded as a system with a small magnetic field of magnitude @xmath94 .",
    "the band structure may be slightly modified .",
    "it is worthwhile to start from the band of @xmath77 as a first approximation and to make iteration in order to obtain self - consistent solutions at arbitrary @xmath79 .",
    "we solve the mean field hamiltonian @xmath95 under the self - consistency condition at @xmath96 . here",
    "we solve , instead , a hamiltonian which has the phase of eq.(23 ) but has the magnitude of the @xmath77 state .",
    "the integer quantum hall state has an energy gap of the landau levels due to @xmath97 .",
    "this occurs when an integer number of landau levels is filled completely .",
    "the landau level structure is determined by the phase factor .",
    "magnitudes of the physical quantities may be modified , nevertheless .",
    "@xmath98 was obtained in the previous part , and it is approximated with the effective mass formula .",
    "@xmath73from eq.(19 ) , @xmath99 landau levels are completely filled , and the integer quantum hall effect occurs at @xmath79 .",
    "the energy gap is given by the landau level spacing @xmath100    these equations were solved numerically , and the energy gaps and the widths of excited bands are obtained .",
    "some bands are narrow and some bands are wide . near @xmath77 , the effective magnetic field approaches zero , and the landau level wave functions have large spatial extension .",
    "the lattice structure becomes negligible , and the spectrum shows simple landau levels of the continuum equation in these regions . near @xmath101 ,",
    "the lattice structure is not negligible , and bands have finite widths .",
    "there are non - negligible corrections from those of continuum calculations .    due to the energy gap of the integer hall effect caused by the induced dynamical magnetic field ,",
    "the states at @xmath79 are stable , and fluctuations are weak .",
    "invariance under @xmath89 , moreover , ensures these states to have uniform density . in systems with impurities ,",
    "localized states with isolated discrete energies are generated by impurities and have energies in the gap regions .",
    "these states contribute to the density but do not contribute to the conductance .",
    "if the fermi energy is in one of these gap regions , the hall conductance @xmath65 is given by a topological formula , eq.(16 ) , and remains constant , at @xmath102 .",
    "the fractional hall effect is realized .    at a value of @xmath74 smaller than 1/3 ,",
    "the hofstadter butterfly exhibits other kinds of structures .",
    "they may be connected with the wigner crystall .      in the previous section we presented our mean field theory based on flux condensation , where lattice structure generated by the external magnetic field and condensed flux due to interaction are important ingredients .",
    "consequently , our mean field hamiltonian becomes very similar to that of hofstadter , which is known to show a large energy gap zone along the @xmath71 line .",
    "the line @xmath71 is special in the hofstadter problem and hence in our mean field hamiltonian .",
    "this explains why the experiments of the fractional quantum hall effects show characteristic behavior at @xmath79 .",
    "the ground states at @xmath79 have the lowest energy and the largest energy gap , and hence these states are stable . in this section",
    "we compare the energy gaps of the principal series in the lowest order , with experiments and with laughlin variational wave function .",
    "the effective mass @xmath87 of eq.(22 ) was obtained from the curvature of the energy dispersion and should show a characteristic mass scale of the fractional hall effect .",
    "the landau level energy in the lowest approximation is calculated , and the gap energy is given in eq.(24 ) .",
    "these values are compared with the experimental values and with the composite fermion mean field values .",
    "our mean field values are close to the experimental values .",
    "for example , at @xmath101 , the composite fermion mean field theory gives @xmath103=380[k ] , which is a factor of 40 larger than the experimental value .",
    "whereas , our effective mass formula gives @xmath103=24[k ] , and the other approximation gives @xmath103=36[k ] , which are a factor of two or three larger than the experimental value and close to the value of the laughlin wave function , @xmath103=26[k ] .",
    "the agreement is not perfect , but should be regarded as good as the lowest mean field approximation . near @xmath101 , the bands have finite widths , and near @xmath77 , the widths are infinitesimal .",
    "the dependence of the width upon the filling factor , @xmath74 , and the entire structure of the bands are characteristic features of the present mean field and should be tested experimentally .",
    "we formulated the quantum hall effect , integer hall effect and fractional hall effect with the von neumann lattice representation of two - dimensional electrons in a strong magnetic field .",
    "the von neumann lattice is a subset of the coherent state .",
    "the overlap of states is expressed with a elliptic theta function .",
    "they allow for a systematic method of expressing the quantum hall dynamics .",
    "a topological invariant expression of the hall conductance was obtained in which compactness of the momentum space is ensured by the lattice of the coordinate space . because the lattice has an origin in the external magnetic field , the topological character of the hall conductance is ensured by the external magnetic field .",
    "the conductance is quantized exactly as @xmath104 in the quantum hall regime .",
    "the integer @xmath105 increases monotonically with the chemical potential .",
    "a new mean field theory of the fractional hall effect that has dynamical flux condensation was proposed . in our mean field theory , lattice structure is introduced from the von neumann lattice and , flux is introduced dynamically . the mean field hamiltonian becomes a kind of tight - binding model , and the rich structure of the tight - binding model is seen as characteristic features of the fractional hall effect in our mean field flux states of having a liquid property with an energy gap .",
    "these states satisfy the self - consistency condition of having the lowest energy and the largest energy gap .",
    "the physical quantities of our mean field theory are close to the experimental values in the lowest order at @xmath79 .",
