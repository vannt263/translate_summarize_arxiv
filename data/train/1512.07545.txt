    "the spectral gap @xmath1 is reduced compared to the order parameter @xmath2 , and the bcs edge singularity @xmath3 is replaced by the square - root vanishing behavior @xmath4 .",
    "the effect of magnetic impurities on the superconducting state becomes more fascinating beyond the born limit . in this case",
    ", a single magnetic impurity produces a localized state inside the bcs gap @xcite , which can be visualized experimentally @xcite . at finite concentration of magnetic impurities , the states localized on different impurities overlap and form an impurity band .",
    "as the concentration grows , the band becomes wider . if it merges with the continuum of quasiparticle states , then the ag - like regime is realized .",
    "alternatively , the impurity band can touch the fermi energy ( @xmath5 ) before merging with the continuum ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a review ) .",
    "although various structures of the dos with several spectral edges can be realized depending on the parameters of magnetic disorder ( strength of individual impurities and their concentration ) , a general feature of the mean - field results @xcite is that all the gaps @xmath6 in the spectrum remain hard , sharply dividing energy regions with zero and finite [ with @xmath7 dos .",
    "the square - root vanishing of the dos is not specific to superconductors with magnetic disorder .",
    "the same qualitative behavior is observed , e.g. , in the mean - field treatment of proximity - coupled normal - superconducting ( ns ) structures @xcite , in the model of a random cooper - channel interaction constant @xcite , in the random - matrix theory ( wigner semicircle ) @xcite , for imbalanced vacancies in graphene @xcite , etc .",
    "existence of the sharp spectral edge is an artefact of the mean - field approximation .",
    "the exact treatment reveals a tail of the subgap states formed in the classically gapped region .",
    "the physical origin of these states is related to fluctuations , when some rear disorder configurations , missed on the mean - field level , lead to local shifts of the spectral edges . averaging over fluctuations then results in the spatially homogeneous nonzero subgap dos .",
    "fluctuation smearing of the gap edge was first considered by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) in the model of a diffusive superconductor with short - range disorder in the cooper - channel constant @xcite .",
    "they described formation of subgap states in the language of optimal fluctuations of the order - parameter field @xmath8 , generalizing the method originally developed in the studies of doped semiconductors ( for a review , see ref .",
    "the resulting average dos decays with the stretched - exponential law as a function of @xmath9 , with the width of the tail determined by the magnitude of @xmath8 fluctuations .",

    "they also obtained a stretched - exponential decay of the average dos as a function of the distance @xmath9 .",
    "in contrast to the lo theory , the smallness of this effect is controlled by the large normal - state conductance , @xmath10 , rather than by the magnitude of @xmath8 fluctuations , indicating that the tail obtained is determined solely by fluctuations of potential disorder .",
    "the same type of instanton was shown to describe the smearing of the minigap in sns junctions @xcite .",
    "physically , the subgap states obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite are due to mesoscopic fluctuations originating from the randomness of potential disorder . in this respect",
    ", they resemble the states beyond the wigner semicircle in the random - matrix theory @xcite .",
    "this analogy was exploited in refs .",
    "@xcite , where tail formation in zero - dimensional superconducting systems was studied . the results by simons _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite can then be considered as a direct generalization of previous random - matrix results to nonzero dimensionalities .",
    "the apparent discrepancy between the results of larkin and ovchinnikov @xcite and meyer and simons @xcite for the random - coupling model was recently resolved in ref .",
    "@xcite , where it was demonstrated that the two different regimes correspond to different limits of the same instanton solution .",
    "sufficiently close to the gap edge , at small @xmath9 , fluctuations of @xmath8 ( nonpotential disorder ) are more important , and the subgap dos is described by the lo theory . in the far asymptotics realized at sufficiently large @xmath9 , the dos tail is determined by more efficient mesoscopic fluctuations ( potential disorder ) .",
    "mathematically , interplay of these two different physical sources of disorder manifests itself as the competition between two types of nonlinearities in the instanton equations .",
    "an important feature of disorder - induced gap smearing is its large degree of universality in the vicinity of @xmath1 , where any type of nonpotential disorder can be mapped onto an effective random order parameter ( rop ) model @xcite .",
    "this mapping should be understood in a sense that the dos smearing in the original problem is equivalent to the dos smearing in an artificial model , where @xmath8 is the only fluctuating quantity ( even though the order parameter may not fluctuate in the original problem ) .",
    "the parameters of the initial quenched inhomogeneity are then encoded in the correlation function @xmath11 in the artificial rop model to be determined for a particular problem .",
    "the rop model thus provides a universal account of the subgap dos , describing the interplay of fluctuations due to potential and nonpotential disorder .",
    "the problem with infinitesimally weak magnetic impurities was reduced to the rop model in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the leading source of nonpotential fluctuations was identified as disorder in local magnetization ( triplet sector ) . due to the nonlinearity of the usadel equation",
    ", this disorder translates into fluctuations in the singlet sector , that are equivalent to an emergent inhomogeneity of the effective order parameter . this mechanism ( referred to as direct in ref .",
    "@xcite ) leads to a sufficiently small rop correlation function , so it is possible to have a situation when the lo regime is unobservable and the full tail is due to mesoscopic fluctuations as described by lamacraft and simons @xcite .",
    "subgap states due to magnetic impurities in otherwise clean superconductors were considered in refs .",
    "we are interested in the opposite situation , in which the underlying electron dynamics ( in the absence of magnetic impurities ) is diffusive due to potential scattering .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extend the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite to the case of strong magnetic impurities and to quantitatively describe fluctuation smearing of the gap edges ( see fig .  [ f : dos - smeared ] ) . in the vicinity of the mean - field edge , we reduce the problem to the rop model and calculate the effective correlation function @xmath12 .",
    "the principal difference from the born limit is that now the primary source of disorder is due to fluctuations of the concentration of magnetic impurities which leads to a larger correlation function @xmath12 in the rop model , as it does not require excitations of the triplet modes . as a consequence , the previous results by marchetti and simons",
    "@xcite describe only the far asymptotics of the dos tails due to mesoscopic fluctuations , whereas the main asymptotics is given by the lo - type expression arising due to poissonian fluctuations of magnetic disorder .",
    "the importance of the poissonian statistics of magnetic impurities was realized by silva and ioffe @xcite , who found the main asymptotics of the subgap dos in the case of weak impurities ( close to the born limit ) .",
