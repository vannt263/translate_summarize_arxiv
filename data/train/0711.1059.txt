    "it is now widely accepted that dark energy is responsible for driving the observed acceleration of the universe . in recent years , measuring and constraining the nature of this dark energy has become a central focus of current studies in cosmology .",
    "several different methods have been developed and shown to probe the nature of dark energy through its effects on the geometry and structure of the universe e.g. @xcite .",
    "large - scale sky surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey have no doubt aided this kind of study @xcite and more such galaxy surveys are now being planned to exploit the different techniques that will help us better understand the nature of dark energy .",
    "the proposed dark energy survey is one such experiment . it will use four independent probes namely galaxy clusters , galaxy power spectrum measurements , weak lensing studies and a supernova survey to constrain the nature of dark energy .",
    "each of these methods relies on accurate distance measurements extending over cosmological scales .",
    "given the wealth of data that will be available to us from such surveys , measuring distances and redshifts for all the objects using spectroscopic methods clearly becomes unfeasible .",
    "hence the need for photometric redshifts .",
    "photometric redshift estimation methods have been around since the 1960s but have undergone a recent revival with proposals for a new generation of large - scale photometric surveys such as the dark energy survey .",
    "new algorithms have been developed for photo - z estimation and made available to the community e.g. @xcite .",
    "furthermore , there is currently a lot of emphasis on optimising the depth and number of bands that will be used to image galaxies in future galaxy surveys so as to obtain accurate photometric redshifts .",
    "it is widely known that imaging in more bands can help reduce errors on photometric redshifts but the costs of adding more filters to planned surveys are significant .",
    "given the plethora of data that is now becoming available to us covering the whole range of the electromagnetic bands and a large portion of the observable sky , it is vital that we explore the overlap between different surveys and fully exploit the data sets available to us , in order to achieve the best compromise between cost and science .    in this paper",
    "we analyse the prospect of combining optical data from the dark energy survey ( des ) with near infra - red data from the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) in order to obtain accurate photometric redshifts that will help us better constrain the nature of dark energy .",
    "we begin with a brief description of these two proposed surveys and a description of the method used to generate mock galaxy samples for both of these surveys .",
    "we then proceed to a full photometric redshift analysis of simulated data from these two surveys using artificial neural networks .",
    "we assess the impact of reddening on our photometric redshift estimate as well as the effects of removing outliers and using different training sets . in each case",
    ", we present results obtained for the optical data from des only and for optical and near - infra red data from des and vhs .",
    "finally , we look at the implications of our results for cosmological constraints on dark energy . in particular",
    ", we concentrate on the impact of photometric redshift errors on constraints on dark energy using galaxy power spectrum measurements .",
    "all magnitudes quoted in this paper are in the ab system .",
    "the dark energy survey is a proposed ground - based photometric survey that will image 5000deg@xmath9 of the south galactic cap in the optical @xmath10 bands as well as the @xmath11-band .",
    "the survey will be carried out using the blanco 4-m telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile .",
    "the main objectives of the survey are to extract information on the nature and density of dark energy and dark matter using galaxy clusters , galaxy power spectrum measurements , weak lensing studies and a supernova survey . this will be achieved by measuring redshifts of some 300 million galaxies in the redshift range @xmath12 , tens of thousands of clusters in the redshift range @xmath13 and about 2000 type 1a supernovae in the redshift range @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "observations will be carried out over 525 nights spread over five years between 2010 and 2014 and when completed , des will provide a legacy archive of data extending around two magnitudes deeper than the sloan digital sky survey which is currently the largest existing ccd survey of the universe by volume . we have estimated the des volume to be @xmath15 in the range @xmath12 , about ten times that of the sdss lrg sample @xcite .",
    "this is assuming a 10@xmath16 ab magnitude limit of @xmath17 .",
    "the des survey area overlaps with that of several other important current and future surveys for example the southern equatorial strip of the sloan digital sky survey and the south pole telescope sze cluster survey .",
    "the entire des region will also be imaged in the near infra - red bands on two public surveys being conducted on the visible and infra - red survey telescope for astronomy ( vista ) at eso s cerro paranal observatory in chile .",
    "most of the time on the vista telescope has been dedicated to large - scale public surveys .",
    "two of these surveys that are relevant to cosmology are the vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) and the vista kilo - degree infra - red galaxy survey ( viking ) - @xcite .",
    "the vista hemisphere survey is a proposed panoramic infra - red survey that will image the entire southern sky ( @xmath620000deg@xmath9 ) in the near infra - red @xmath18 bands when combined with other public surveys .",
    "about 40% of the total vhs time has been dedicated to vhs - des , a 4500deg@xmath9 survey being carried out in the des region over 125 nights in order to complement the des optical data with near infra - red data .",
    "the initial proposal is for the survey to image in the @xmath1 bands with 120s exposure times in each band reaching @xmath19 magnitude limits of @xmath20,@xmath21 and @xmath22 . a second pass",
    "may then be obtained with 240s exposures in each of the three nir filters in order to reach the full - depth required by des .",
    "the vhs - des survey assumes that @xmath11-band photometry will come from the dark energy survey .",
    "the remaining 500deg@xmath9 of the des area not covered by vhs - des , will be imaged by viking which is a near infra - red survey designed to provide an important complement to the optical kids project being carried out on the vst .",
    "the details for all these surveys are summarised in table [ tab::surveys ] .",

    "[ tab::surveys ] [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we first quantify the difference in the bias when using different numbers of training set galaxies to calculate photometric redshifts for the same sample of testing set galaxies .",
    "note that the differences in the bias calculated here are used as empirical estimators of the systematic shift one would get when dealing with data .",
    "set3 and set4 are used as training sets to calculate photometric redshifts for sete .",
    "all three samples are complete and have no imposed colour cuts . in figure",
    "[ fig : nv ] we plot the biases obtained for each of the two cases and the difference between these .",
    "this shows us that changing the size of our training set by a factor of @xmath23 leads to a difference in the biases of the order of @xmath24 .",
    "we proceed now to look at effects of incomplete training sets on the photometric redshift bias . to do this , we use set1 and set2 as training sets to calculate the photometric redshifts for samples seta , setb , setc and setd .",
    "set1 is a complete training set while set2 has been cut to reflect the colour cuts of the deep2 survey .",
    "seta and setb are both complete testing sets with different galaxies in them from the des5yr mock catalogue , while setc is generated by imposing the deep2 colour cuts on setb and setd by imposing the deep2 colour cuts on seta .",
    "the biases on the photo - z estimate obtained for each of the different configurations of training and testing sets , are shown in figure [ fig : biases ] .",
    "note that throughout this analysis , we use bins of width 0.04 in redshift space .         from figure [",
    "fig : biases ] we can draw the following general conclusions . changing the galaxies that are present in the testing set when training with a complete and fully representative training set , leads to a change in the bias of the order @xmath24 . using",
    "an incomplete training set on these samples also leads to the same difference in the bias between them ( figure [ fig : biases ] - right panel , broken line ) . when using an incomplete training set such as that provided by the deep2 survey ( set2 ) on a testing set of galaxies with no imposed colour cuts ( seta and setb ) , the bias in the photometric redshift is worsened as expected .",
    "however , if we impose the same colour cuts as deep2 on our testing set ( setc ) , the bias is improved by @xmath620% for @xmath25 and by @xmath640% for @xmath26 - i.e. in the redshift ranges where the training set is incomplete .",
    "the difference in the bias when using a testing set with no colour cuts and one with imposed colour cuts to match those of the incomplete training set , is of the order of @xmath27 and always smaller than @xmath28 in the redshift range of the incomplete training set - inset , left - hand panel of figure [ fig : biases ] .    in @xmath29[sec :",
    "cosmology2 ] , we will briefly comment on how the errors on the photometric redshift bias propagate into errors in the calculation of the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , we look at the impact of photometric redshift estimation on dark energy science . in particular , we concentrate on the measurement of dark energy using galaxy power spectra and baryon acoustic oscillations .",
    "the galaxy angular power spectrum is a measure of the clustering in the galaxy population within time bins extending from the present to a time when the universe was only a third of its present age .",
    "large - scale surveys like des provide ideal data sets for studying the clustering properties of galaxies and therefore the clustering properties of their underlying dark matter distribution and hence are useful probes for mapping how the dark matter distribution evolves with time . furthermore , many other characteristic features appear in the power spectrum which provide _ standard rulers _ that can be used to determine the angular diameter distance , @xmath30 , as a function of redshift",
    ". baryon acoustic oscillations are one such feature of interest which appear as _ wiggles _ on the power spectrum .",
    "the position of the peaks and troughs of these wiggles in fourier space can be used to determine a set of cosmological parameters e.g. @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the accuracy with which we can measure this typical acoustic scale is proportional to the average fractional error in the power spectrum , @xmath31 .",
    "the fractional error on the power spectrum arises from two sources .",
    "firstly , the number of independant spatial modes that we can measure in a given volume is finite and this will lead to errors in the power spectrum that are proportional to @xmath32 .",
    "this is known as cosmic variance .",
    "secondly , there is a contribution from shot noise due to imperfect sampling of the fluctuations as we only have a finite number of tracers of these fluctuations within a given volume . if we assume a density field that follows gaussian statistics , we can follow @xcite and assume the error on the power spectrum measurement , @xmath33 is weighted in the following way :    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the mean number density in a given volume as seen by an observer and can be written in terms of the galaxy redshift distribution as follows :    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the fraction of the sky covered by the survey and @xmath38 is the comoving volume element .    the first term in eq .",
    "[ eq : errorps ] denotes the effect of cosmic variance while the second term is the contribution from shot noise . in order to minimise the error on the power spectrum",
    ", one has to design a survey with maximum volume provided there are enough sources within this volume for the shot noise contribution to be minimal . if @xmath39 the power spectrum is well estimated and there is no significant advantage to be gained with more galaxies @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we assume that to obtain a reasonable estimate of the power spectrum we need to satisfy the condition , @xmath40 . taking into account the galaxy bias , @xmath41 that scales the galaxy power spectrum to the matter power spectrum , and including the scaling of the matter power spectrum with redshift as a linear growth factor , @xmath42 we get the following expression for @xmath43 :    @xmath44    we have used the formalism for the transfer function set out in @xcite to calculate our power spectrum at @xmath45 as this is well within the linear regime of the power spectrum . at larger values of @xmath46 ,",
    "non - linearities due to clustering and other structure formation start to dominate and make it harder to detect the bao signal .",
    "we assume a survey with @xmath12 and @xmath47 .",
    "the bias is assumed to be 1.2 .",
    "will be for des galaxies .",
    "we have therefore used a reasonable scale independant bias in our calculations . ] in figure [ fig : powerspec ] , we plot @xmath43 as a function of the redshift .",
    "this is done for the entire catalogue and for clipped catalogues with different clipping thresholds .",

    "a reduction in @xmath49 corresponds to a reduction in the intrinsic scatter of our sample minus the outliers .    by clipping our catalogues in this way before performing any kind of cosmological analysis on them , we have effectively managed to reduce the errors in our measurement of the galaxy power spectrum without compromising on the precision with which this measurement has been made .",
    "adding nir data from vhs to our des photometry has also allowed us to clip our catalogues more effectively and therefore make more precise measurements of the galaxy power spectrum out to higher redshifts .",
    "we now follow @xcite and @xcite and take into account the photometric redshift errors explicitly in our galaxy power spectrum analysis .",
    "these authors have shown that the fractional error on the galaxy power spectrum is related to the photometric redshift error as follows :    @xmath64    where @xmath65 is the rms error in comoving coordinates in units of @xmath66 .",

    "our choice of redshift is motivated by figure [ fig : powerspec ] where it can be seen that there are enough galaxies in the survey out to a redshift of 2 for shot - noise errors not to be significant , provided we do not clip our sample .",

    "however this also reduces @xmath72 and therefore @xmath73 , thereby increasing the shot - noise contribution to the error in the power spectrum due to a lack of sufficient galaxies in the sample . clearly , there is a threshold error that needs to be determined and this is what we proceed to do .",
    "the results of our study are shown in figure [ fig : deltap ] and table [ tab : deltap ] where we plot the fractional error in the power spectrum for different levels of clipping divided by the fractional error in the power spectrum obtained using the entire sample .",
    "we only do this for clipping thresholds greater than or equal to 0.03 as below this , shot noise is dominant across the entire redshift range .",

    "most of the galaxies in the sample are used for analysis and shot - noise is not a problem . however , the scatter on the photometric redshift is large leading to larger errors in the power spectrum measurement . at very low values of the threshold error ,",
    "the photo - z scatter is reduced but there are too few galaxies in the sample and shot noise begins to dominate .",
    "there is an optimum value of the threshold error at which the fractional errors in the power spectrum are at a minimum .",
    "this value is different for different redshift ranges as well as for the two different catalogues .",
    "when we add the vhs nir data to the des optical catalogue , we can apply a smaller clipping threshold out to the same redshift range compared to the des only case in order to minimise the error in the power spectrum .",
    "this means we remove more outliers from the des+vhs catalogue and thereby reduce our photometric redshift errors without compromising on the precision with which we can do cosmology .",
    "also , we can see that using the des only catalogue , we are unable to clip in the highest redshift bin of @xmath79 as this increases the shot noise errors in our power spectrum .",
    "however , if we add the vhs nir photometry , we can remove @xmath620% of our galaxies in this bin and produce a power spectrum that is 15 - 20% more accurate than that obtained using all the galaxies .",
    "we can conclude that in the absence of large spectroscopic surveys like the proposed wfmos survey @xcite , photometric surveys could prove competitive in constraining dark energy through galaxy power spectrum measurements if the outliers were effectively removed .",
    "it is worth noting though that when applying this clipping procedure to a real survey , one would choose the optimal clipping threshold based on the training sets available and not from simulations .      in this section",
    "we look at the effect of the photometric redshift bias on the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath5 .",
    "we have already seen in @xmath29[sec : bias ] that systematic errors in the photometric redshift bias can arise when we use different numbers of galaxies in our training and testing sets and also when one or both of these samples is in some way incomplete .",

    "is equivalent to having a cosmic variance limited sample , we conclude that systematics on the photo - z bias due to cosmic variance do not hinder the calibration of @xmath5 to a percent level .",
    "however , the black solid line of figure [ fig : dw ] shows us that using an incomplete training set to calibrate photometric redshifts for des would lead to large uncertainties in @xmath5 unless the sample being tested was cut to match the training set .",
    "these results are relatively insensitive to the clipping procedure introduced in @xmath29 [ sec : clip ] and therefore have been carried out in all cases for the umclipped catalogues of galaxies .",

    "the addition of vhs nir data is crucial . in this redshift range , applying the optimal clipping threshold of 0.1 results in an improvement in @xmath31 by @xmath615 - 20% . * systematic errors on the photometric redshift bias arising from cosmic variance lead to uncertainties in the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath5 , of about a percent .",
    "* however if we use an incomplete training set to determine photometric redshifts on a testing set that hasnt been cut to match the training set , the resulting uncertainties in the photometric redshift bias can lead to errors in @xmath5 of the order of @xmath610% if we keep all other cosmological parameters as constant .",

    "<S> we conduct a detailed analysis of the photometric redshift requirements for the proposed dark energy survey ( des ) using two sets of mock galaxy simulations and an artificial neural network code - annz . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we examine how optical photometry in the des @xmath0 bands can be complemented with near infra - red photometry from the planned vista hemisphere survey ( vhs ) in the @xmath1 bands . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the rms scatter on the photometric redshift estimate over @xmath2 is @xmath3=0.2 from des alone and @xmath3=0.15 from des+vista , i.e. an improvement of more than 30% . </S>",
    "<S> we draw attention to the effects of galaxy formation scenarios such as reddening on the photo - z estimate and using our neural network code , calculate the extinction , @xmath4 for these reddened galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we also look at the impact of using different training sets when calculating photometric redshifts . in particular , we find that using the ongoing deep2 and vvds - deep spectroscopic surveys to calibrate photometric redshifts for des , will prove effective </S>",
    "<S> . however we need to be aware of uncertainties in the photometric redshift bias that arise when using different training sets as these will translate into errors in the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we show that the neural network error estimate on the photometric redshift may be used to remove outliers from our samples before any kind of cosmological analysis , in particular for large - scale structure experiments . by removing all galaxies with a neural network photo - z error estimate of greater than 0.1 from our des+vhs sample </S>",
    "<S> , we can constrain the galaxy power spectrum out to a redshift of 2 and reduce the fractional error on this power spectrum by @xmath615 - 20% compared to using the entire catalogue .    </S>",
    "<S> output tables of spectroscopic redshift versus photometric redshift used to produce the results in this paper can be found at @xmath7 .    </S>",
