    "one of the important tools for studying the properties of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions is the analysis of a qcd jet production .",
    "the medium - induced energy loss of energetic partons , `` jet quenching '' , should be very different in the cold nuclear matter and qgp , resulting in many observable phenomena  @xcite .",
    "recent rhic data on high - p@xmath0 particle production  @xcite ( the suppression of hadron spectra and azimuthal back - to - back two - particle correlations , strong elliptic flow ) are in agreement with the jet quenching hypothesis  @xcite . at lhc",
    ", a new regime of heavy ion physics will be reached at @xmath3 tev where hard and semi - hard particle production can stand out against the underlying soft events .",
    "the initial gluon densities in pb+pb reactions at lhc are expected to be significantly higher than those at rhic , implying a stronger partonic energy loss , observable in various new channels  @xcite .    in the most of available",
    "monte - carlo heavy ion event generators the medium - induced partonic rescattering and energy loss are either ignored or implemented insufficiently  @xcite .",
    "thus , in order to analyze rhic data on high - p@xmath0 hadron production , test the sensitivity of lhc observables to the qgp formation , and study the corresponding experimental capabilities of detectors , the development of adequate and fast monte - carlo models for jet quenching simulation is necessary .",
    "in this paper we present the model of jet quenching and discuss its validation basing on rhic data for high-@xmath4 hadron spectra . in sect .",
    "2 we give the physics frameworks of the model . section 3",
    "describes the event - by - event simulation procedure . in sect .",
    "4 the generalization of the model to the case of `` full '' heavy ion event ( superposition of soft hydro - type state and hard multi - jets ) is fulfilled . in sect .  5",
    "the efficiency of the model is demonstrated by means of the numerical analysis of hadron spectra at rhic .",
    "the detailed description of physics frameworks of the developed model can be found in a number of our previous papers  @xcite .",
    "our approach bases on an accumulating energy loss , the gluon radiation being associated with each parton scattering in the expanding medium and includes the interference effect using the modified radiation spectrum @xmath5 as a function of decreasing temperature @xmath6 . the basic kinetic integral equation for the energy loss @xmath7 as a function of initial energy @xmath8 and path length @xmath9 has the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the current transverse coordinate of a parton , @xmath12 is the scattering probability density , @xmath5 is the energy loss per unit length , @xmath13 is in - medium mean free path , @xmath14 is the medium density at the temperature @xmath6 , @xmath15 is the integral cross section for parton interaction in the medium .",
    "the collisional energy loss due to elastic scattering with high - momentum transfer has been originally estimated by bjorken in  @xcite , and recalculated later in  @xcite taking also into account the low - momentum transfer loss resulting mainly from the interactions with plasma collective modes .",
    "since the latter process does not contribute much to the total collisional loss in comparison with high - momentum scattering ( due to absence of large factor @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the debye screening mass ) and , in numerical estimates it can be effectively `` absorbed '' by means of redefinition of minimum momentum transfer @xmath18 , we used the collisional part associated with high - momentum transfer only  @xcite , @xmath19 and the dominant contribution to the differential cross section @xmath20 for scattering of a hard parton with energy @xmath8 and mass @xmath21 off the `` thermal '' parton with energy ( or effective mass ) @xmath22 . here @xmath23 for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 scatterings respectively , @xmath27 is the qcd running coupling constant for @xmath28 active quark flavors , and @xmath29 is the qcd scale parameter which is of the order of the critical temperature , @xmath30 mev . the integrated cross section @xmath15 is regularized by the debye screening mass squared @xmath31 .",
    "the maximum momentum transfer @xmath32 [ s-(m_p - m_0)^2 ] /   s$ ] where @xmath33 .",
    "there are several calculations of the inclusive energy distribution of medium - induced gluon radiation using feyman multiple scattering diagrams .",
    "the relation between these approaches and their basic parameters has been discussed in detail in the recent writeup of the working group `` jet physics '' for the cern yellow report  @xcite .",
    "we restrict ourselves to using bdms formalism  @xcite . in the bdms frameworks ,",
    "the strength of multiple scattering is characterized by the transport coefficient @xmath34 ( @xmath35 is the gluon mean free path ) , which is related to the elastic scattering cross section @xmath15 ( [ sigt ] ) . in our simulations",
    "this strength is in fact regulated mainly by the initial qgp temperature @xmath36 .",
    "then the energy spectrum of coherent medium - induced gluon radiation and the corresponding dominant part of radiative energy loss of massless parton have the form  @xcite : @xmath37   \\>\\ln{\\left| \\cos{(\\omega_1\\tau_1 ) } \\right| }   \\ > , \\\\",

    "@xcite . the integration ( [ radiat ] )",
    "is carried out over all energies from @xmath42 , the minimum radiated gluon energy in the coherent lpm regime , up to initial parton energy @xmath8 .",
    "note that we do not consider here possible effects of double parton scattering  @xcite and thermal gluon absorption  @xcite , which can be included in the model in the future .",
    "the simplest generalization of the formula for a heavy quark of mass @xmath43 can be done by using the `` dead - cone '' approximation  @xcite : @xmath44 one should mention the more recent developments on heavy quark energy loss calculations available in the literature  @xcite , which can be also considered as further model improvements .",
    "the medium is treated as a boost - invariant longitudinally expanding quark - gluon fluid , and partons as being produced on a hyper - surface of equal proper times @xmath45  @xcite . in order to simplify numerical calculations",
    "we omit here the transverse expansion and viscosity of the fluid using the well - known scaling solution obtained by bjorken  @xcite for a temperature and density of qgp at @xmath46 mev : @xmath47 the internal model parameters are the initial conditions for the qgp formation expected for central au+au ( pb+pb ) collisions at rhic ( lhc ) : @xmath48 , @xmath36 and @xmath28 .",
    "for non - central collisions and for other beam atomic numbers we suggest the proportionality of the initial energy density @xmath49 to the ratio of nuclear overlap function and effective transverse area of nuclear overlapping  @xcite .",
    "note that using other scenarios of qgp space - time evolution for the monte - carlo implementation of the model is also envisaged .",
    "in fact , the influence of the transverse flow , as well as that of the mixed phase at @xmath50 , on the intensity of jet rescattering ( which is a strongly increasing function of @xmath6 ) has been found to be inessential for high initial temperatures @xmath51 . on the contrary , the presence of qgp viscosity slows down the cooling rate , that implies a jet parton spending more time in the hottest regions of the medium . as a result the rescattering intensity increases , i.e. , in fact an effective temperature of the medium gets higher as compared with the perfect qgp case .",
    "we also do not take into account here the probability of jet rescattering in nuclear matter , because the intensity of this process and corresponding contribution to the total energy loss are not significant due to much smaller energy density in a `` cold '' nucleus .",
    "another important element of the model is the angular spectrum of in - medium gluon radiation .",
    "since the detailed calculation of the angular spectrum of emitted gluons is rather sophisticated and model - dependent  @xcite , the simple parameterization of gluon angular distribution over the emission angle @xmath52 was used : @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the typical angle of the coherent gluon radiation as estimated in  @xcite .",
    "other parameterizations are also envisaged .",
    "the model has been constructed as the fast monte - carlo event generator pyquen ( pythia quenched ) , and the corresponding fortran routine pyquen is available via internet  @xcite .",

    "we also set the poisson multiplicity distribution and the following particle ratios : @xmath105    the hard part of the event includes pythia / pyquen hadronic jets generated according to the binomial distribution .",
    "the mean number of jets produced in aa events at a given @xmath57 is proportional to the number of binary nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions and determined as @xmath106 where @xmath107 is the cross section of corresponding hard process in @xmath108 collisions ( at the same c.m.s .",
    "energy , @xmath109 , of colliding beams ) with the minimum transverse momentum transfer @xmath110 .",
    "the latter is another input parameter of the model . in the frameworks of our approximation , partons produced in ( semi)hard processes with the momentum transfer less than @xmath110",
    "are considered as being `` thermalized '' , so their hadronization products are included in a soft part of the event `` automatically '' .",
    "note that we can expect some adequate results only for central and semi - central collisions , but not for very peripheral collisions ( @xmath111 ) where the hydro - type description is not applicable .",
    "besides , the very forward rapidity region ( where other dynamical effects can be important ) is beyond our treatment here .",
    "the extended in such a way jet quenching model has been constructed as the fast monte - carlo event generator , and the corresponding fortran code is also available via internet  @xcite .",
    "let us remind in the end of this section , that ideologically our approximation is similar to the model of hirano and nara  @xcite .",
    "the difference is that we concentrate here on the detailed simulation of the parton multiple scattering in a qcd - medium ( the scattering - by - scattering generation of parton path length and energy loss in an expanding qgp , taking into account the collisional loss , lund string fragmentation model both for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons , etc . ) , while the treatment of the hydrodynamic part in  @xcite is much more detailed than in our simple ( and therefore fast ) simulation procedure .",
    "in order to demonstrate the efficiency of the model , the jet quenching pattern in au+au collisions at rhic was considered . the comparison of calculated and experimentally measured pseudorapidity @xmath113 and transverse momentum @xmath4 spectra of hadrons together with their dependence of event centrality allows the optimization of the model and specification of main model parameters .    the phobos data on @xmath113-spectra of charged hadrons  @xcite have been analyzed to fix the particle density in the mid - rapidity region and the maximum longitudinal flow rapidity , @xmath114 . for the calculation of ( multi)jet production cross section",
    ", we used the factor @xmath115 taking into account higher order corrections of perturbative qcd .",
    "the rest of the model parameters have been obtained by fitting phenix data on @xmath4-spectra of neutral pions  @xcite : the kinetic freeze - out temperature @xmath116 mev , maximum transverse flow rapidity @xmath117 and minimum transverse momentum transfer of `` non - thermalized '' hard process @xmath118 gev/@xmath119 .",
    "it was found that the nuclear modification of the hardest domain of @xmath4-spectrum ( @xmath120 gev/@xmath119 ) is determined in our case only by the intensity of the medium - induced parton rescattering .",
    "this fact allows us to extract from the data initial conditions of the qgp formation independently on other input parameters : the initial temperature @xmath121 mev , the formation time @xmath122 fm/@xmath119 and the number of active quark flavours @xmath123 .",
    "we will see below , that setting model parameters as it was described above , makes it possible to reproduce the main features of jet quenching pattern at rhic : the @xmath4dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath124 and two - particle azimuthal correlation function @xmath125 .",
    "figure 1 shows @xmath113-distribution of charged hadrons in au+au collisions for different centrality sets .",
    "the good fit of phobos data  @xcite is achieved excepting very forward rapidities .",
    "the @xmath4-distributions of @xmath126-mesons obtained at phenix  @xcite is also well reproduced by our calculations , even for relatively peripheral collisions ( figure 2 ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the nuclear modification factor @xmath124 for neutral pions , which is defined as a ratio of particle yields in @xmath127 and @xmath108 collisions normalized on the number of binary nucleon - nucleon sub - collisions : @xmath128 where @xmath129 mb is the inelastic non - diffractive @xmath108 cross section at @xmath130 gev . in the absence of medium - induced effects in the mid - rapidity region",
    "it should be @xmath131 for high enough @xmath132 gev/@xmath119 ) .",
    "such value of @xmath133 has been observed so for d+au and peripheral au+au collisions , but not for central and semi - central au+au events , where @xmath134 up to maximum measured transverse momenta @xmath135 gev/@xmath119 .",
    "one can see from figure 3 that our model calculations reproduce @xmath4 and centrality dependences of @xmath124  @xcite quite well .    another important tool to verify jet quenching is two - particle azimuthal correlation function @xmath125  the distribution over an azimuthal angle of high-@xmath4 hadrons in the event with @xmath136 gev/@xmath137 relative to that for the hardest `` trigger '' particle with @xmath138 gev/@xmath119 .",
    "figure 4 presents @xmath125 in @xmath108 and in central au+au collisions ( data from star  @xcite ) .",
    "clear peaks in @xmath108 collisions at @xmath139 and @xmath140 indicate a typical dijet event topology .",
    "note that almost the same pattern has been observed in d+au and peripheral au+au collisions .",
    "however , for most central au+au collisions the peak near @xmath141 disappears .",
    "it can be interpreted as the observation of monojet events due to the `` absorption '' of one of the jets in a dense medium .",
    "such event configuration corresponds to the situation when the dijet production vertex is close to the surface of the nuclear overlap region : then one partonic jet can escape the medium almost without re - interactions and then go to detectors , while second jet loses most of its initial energy due to a large number of rescatterings and therefore becomes unobservable  @xcite .",
    "figure 4 demonstrates that measured suppression of azimuthal back - to - back correlations is well reproduced by our model ( the same procedure of uncorrelated background subtraction as in  @xcite was applied ) .",
    "we leave beyond the scope of this paper the analysis of such important rhic observables as the azimuthal anisotropy and particle ratios .",
    "since these observables are very sensitive to the soft physics , in order to study them a more careful treatment of low-@xmath4 particle production than our simple approach is needed ( the detailed description of space - time structure of freeze - out region , resonance decays , etc . ) for example , our model can reproduce experimentally measured  @xcite @xmath4-dependence of the coefficient of azimuthal anisotropy @xmath142 ( the second harmonic of fourier decomposition of particle azimuthal distribution ) qualitatively , giving rapid hydrodynamical growth up to @xmath143 gev/@xmath119 with the subsequent saturation .",
    "however , the model calculations significantly underestimate the data at @xmath144 gev/@xmath119 .",
    "a solution of baryon - to - meson ratio `` puzzle ''  @xcite is also beyond our consideration here .",
    "further development of our model with special emphasis on the more detailed description of low-@xmath4 particle production is planed for the future .",
    "the model of jet quenching in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions has been developed .",
    "it includes the generation of the hard parton production vertex according to the realistic nuclear geometry , rescattering - by - rescattering simulation of the parton path length in a dense matter , radiative and collisional energy loss per rescattering , final hadronization with the lund string fragmentation model for hard partons and in - medium emitted gluons .",
    "the model is the fast monte - carlo tool implemented to modify a standard pythia jet event .",
    "the model has been generalized to the case of the `` full '' heavy ion event ( the superposition of soft , hydro - type state and hard multi - jets ) using a simple and fast simulation procedure for soft particle production .",
    "the efficiency of the model is demonstrated basing on the numerical analysis of high-@xmath4 hadron production in au+au collisions at rhic .",
    "the good fit of experimental data on @xmath113 and @xmath4 spectra of hadrons for different event centralities is achieved .",
    "the model is capable of reproducing main features of the jet quenching pattern at rhic : the @xmath4 dependence of the nuclear modification factor @xmath124 , and the suppression of azimuthal back - to - back correlations .",
    "the further development of the model focusing on a more detailed description of low-@xmath4 particle production is planed for the future .    _",
