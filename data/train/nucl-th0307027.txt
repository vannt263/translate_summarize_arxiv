    "<S> we calculate the transverse momentum distribution of net quarks ( quarks minus antiquarks ) in au+au collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider in the framework of the parton cascade model at two different rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> parton re - scattering and fragmentation is seen to lead to a substantial difference in the slopes of these distributions between mid- and forward - rapidities , in qualitative agreement with the corresponding data for the net baryon distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> collisions of heavy nuclei at relativistic energies are expected to lead to the formation of a deconfined phase of strongly interacting nuclear matter , often referred to as a quark - gluon - plasma ( qgp ) . </S>",
    "<S> evidences for several of the signatures for the formation of this novel state of matter have recently been reported by experiments conducted at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> many aspects of the experimental data indicate that an equilibrated state of hot and dense matter is formed in the collisions of au nuclei at rhic . </S>",
    "<S> one of the open theoretical problems is how quickly this thermalized state is formed and which mechanisms are responsible for the rapid equilibration .    </S>",
    "<S> it is thus of particular interest to identify processes that can give information about the pre - equilibrium dynamics in these collisions . </S>",
    "<S> one possible example of such probes of `` early phase '' physics is the distribution of net baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> baryon number is a locally conserved quantity , and thus its distribution is not easily influenced by final state interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the net baryon number in nucleons is carried by the valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the valence quark distribution in the nucleon is _ defined _ as the difference between the quark and antiquark , or net quark , distribution .    </S>",
    "<S> flavour conservation in strong interactions dictates that quarks and antiquarks are produced in equal numbers in interactions involving sea quarks and gluons , and thus pair production processes do not change the net quark distribution . during their passage through dense matter , </S>",
    "<S> valence quarks collide with other partons and radiate gluons , thereby losing some of their longitudinal momentum . in a recent publication @xcite we have shown how the valence quark distribution in the nucleon , combined with these multiple scattering effects , can explain the net baryon excess observed in au+au collisions at rhic in the central rapidity region .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> we shall demonstrate that the net quark distributions ( and thus the measurable net baryon distribution ) measured in the final state of a heavy ion collision exhibit a strong sensitivity to the dynamics of parton transport processes in these collisions . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the transverse momentum distributions of net quarks vary significantly with rapidity , and their broadening at central rapidities is a direct measure of the amount of rescattering experienced by the valence quarks . </S>",
    "<S> preliminary data reported by the brahms collaboration  @xcite show that the slopes of the net baryon transverse momentum distributions at central and forward rapidities differ significantly and thus support our findings .    </S>",
    "<S> the parton cascade model  @xcite ( pcm ) provides a suitable framework for the study of the formation of a hot and dense partonic phase , starting from clouds of valence quarks , sea quarks , and gluons which populate the nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the pcm was devised as a description of the early , pre - equilibrium phase of a nucleus - nucleus collision at high energy . </S>",
    "<S> the current implementation  @xcite does not include a description of the hadronization of the partonic matter and of the subsequent scattering among hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> these late - stage processes , however , are not expected to significantly alter the distribution of net baryon number with respect to rapidity , since the net baryon number is locally conserved and baryon diffusion in a hadronic gas can be shown to be slow @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> no such investigation has been made for the transverse momentum distribution of the net baryons , but obviously the same arguments apply . also , we have recently found extensive evidence that the transverse momentum distributions of hadrons at rhic reflect the momentum distribution of the partons from which they form  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us briefly recall the fundamental assumptions underlying the pcm . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the state of the dense partonic system can be characterized by a set of one - body distribution functions @xmath0 , where @xmath1 denotes the flavor index ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath3 are coordinates in the eight - dimensional phase space . </S>",
    "<S> the partons are assumed to be on their mass shell , except before their first interaction . in our numerical implementation </S>",
    "<S> , the grv - ho parametrization @xcite is used , and the parton distribution functions are sampled at an initialization scale @xmath4 to create a discrete set of particles . </S>",
    "<S> partons generally propagate on - shell and along straight - line trajectories between interactions . before their first collision , </S>",
    "<S> all partons move with the beam ( target ) rapidity and do not have an `` intrinsic '' transverse momentum .    </S>",
    "<S> the time - evolution of the parton distribution is governed by a relativistic boltzmann equation : @xmath5 \\label{eq03}\\ ] ] where the collision term @xmath6 is a nonlinear functional of the phase - space distribution function . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations discussed below include all lowest - order qcd scattering processes between massless quarks and gluons . </S>",
    "<S> a low momentum transfer cut - off @xmath7 is needed to regularize the infrared divergence of the perturbative parton - parton cross sections . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we include the branchings @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the soft and collinear singularities in the showers are avoided by terminating the branchings when the virtuality of the time - like partons drops below @xmath12 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the results to be discussed below have been obtained using the vni / bms  @xcite implementation of the pcm .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall start our investigation by exploring the transverse momentum distribution of the net quarks as a function of rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the left frame of fig .  [ fig1 ] shows the net quark rapidity distribution for a au+au collision at @xmath13  gev , using the initialization scale and low momentum cut - off scales of the pqcd cross sections , @xmath14  gev@xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations included multiple scatterings among the partons as well as their fragmentation by time - like branchings . </S>",
    "<S> we have already shown  @xcite that the corresponding value for the net baryons is in good agreement with the results obtained by phenix and star experiments  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now focus on the transverse momentum distribution of the net quarks ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> we see that the spectral slopes are essentially identical for @xmath16 and @xmath17 but significantly steeper for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that for @xmath19 the spectra are well represented by exponentials , with the `` temperature '' at mid - rapidity being about 20% larger than at more forward rapidity . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results for @xmath20  gev are given in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] and confirm our findings for @xmath13  gev . if the slopes of the momentum distributions of hadrons remain proportional to the slopes for the partons as predicted by the recombination model @xcite , the differences in the slopes of net baryons at @xmath16 and @xmath18 will reflect this difference in agreement with the preliminary experimental findings .    </S>",
    "<S> the rapidity dependence of the transverse momentum slopes may be caused by a combination of two effects :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> initial state rapidity@xmath21 correlations : as we have shown in a previous publication @xcite , initial ( primary - primary ) parton scattering `` releases '' valence quarks at a rapidity corresponding to the bjorken-@xmath22 they carry according to the parton distribution function of their mother hadron . </S>",
    "<S> this _ predetermined _ rapidity ( and thus longitudinal momentum and energy ) may cause the associated transverse momentum distribution in the primary - primary scattering to become a function of rapidity as well . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   </S>",
    "<S> parton - parton rescattering : the rapidity dependence of the slopes may be due to partons rescattering more often around mid - rapidity than at forward rapidities .    in order to distinguish between these two mechanisms ( or to determine their relative importance ) we perform two analyses . first , we perform a pcm calculation for a au+au collision at @xmath23 200 gev , in which we restrict the interactions among the partons to primary - primary collisions , i.e. allowing each parton to scatter only once . </S>",
    "<S> the results are shown in the left - hand frame of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the spectra at @xmath16 and @xmath18 have nearly identical shapes and both exhibit a power - law behaviour , as expected from pqcd . from this calculation </S>",
    "<S> we may conclude that the observed rapidity - dependence of the transverse momentum slopes is not caused by rapidity@xmath21 correlations in the initial state .    on the other hand , when we plot the average number of collisions suffered by partons as a function of their rapidity ( right frame of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) , we find that the partons ending up at the central rapidities suffer on an average many more collisions than those which end up at larger rapidities . </S>",
    "<S> this result provides a strong indication that the rapidity dependence of the spectral slopes is directly related to the amount of rescattering experienced by the partons , and that an exponential shape of the parton transverse momentum distribution has its origin in the multiple interactions included in the pcm . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find that the shape of the @xmath24 vs. @xmath25 distribution strongly resembles the shape of the rapidity distribution of direct photons produced in parton - parton scatterings , which we have previously shown to be proportional to the number of parton interactions occurring during the evolution of the heavy - ion collision @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the pcm allows us to study the full space - time evolution of the parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore are able to trace the evolution of the net quark momentum distributions at different rapidities from their initial release via primary - primary scattering to their final shape . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig5 ] shows the net quark rapidity distribution ( top frame ) as well as the net quark transverse momentum distributions at @xmath16 ( middle frame ) and @xmath18 ( bottom frame ) at times t=-0.2 fm/@xmath26 , 0 fm/@xmath26 , and 0.2 fm/@xmath26 , where @xmath27 fm/@xmath26 corresponds to the time of maximal overlap of the two colliding nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> note that the longitudinal spread of the partons according to @xmath28 around the centre of the nucleus , incorporated in the pcm , permits collisions between them even when the nuclei have not yet obtained full overlap , provided the collisions are permitted by the cut - offs implemented in the pcm .    </S>",
    "<S> several interesting observations emerge from this analysis : the momentum distribution of the net quarks at larger rapidities gets frozen fairly early during the collision , while the corresponding distributions at central rapidities continue to evolve . </S>",
    "<S> this is true for both the rapidity distributions as well as the transverse momentum distributions .    </S>",
    "<S> this observation suggests that the net quark ( or the net baryon ) distribution at different rapidities can serve as a useful tool to explore the interactions among partons ( quarks ) during the early phase of the heavy - ion collision . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the study of matter emitted at larger rapidities will offer insight into the very early stage of a relativisitic heavy - ion reaction at which the initial parton distributions decohere ( and at which saturation phenomena @xcite may be of importance ) , whereas the mid - rapidy domain will provide information about a system of strongly and multiply interacting partons with all its associated phemonena , ranging from parton equilibration to jet energy - loss .    in brief </S>",
    "<S> , we have studied the rapidity dependence of the net quark distribution in relativistic heavy ion collisions using the parton cascade model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the inverse slopes of the transverse momentum distributions at @xmath16 and @xmath18 in au+au collisions at @xmath13 and 200 gev differ by about 20% , in agreement with recently reported measurements by brahms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that this difference arises due to the different amount of multiple scatterings suffered by partons at central and forward rapidities .    </S>",
