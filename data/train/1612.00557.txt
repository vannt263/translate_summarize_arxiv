    "a standard scenario in quantum parameter estimation can be described as follows : firstly , a probe system would be prepared in an appropriate initial state @xmath116 , and then it undergoes an evolution which would imprint the parameter information onto the evolved state , say @xmath40 , and finally it would subject to a povm measurement . the overall process is repeated @xmath117 times , and we infer the parameter @xmath38 from the statistics of the measurement outcomes by choosing an unbiased estimator .",

    "we reconsider the order of @xmath30 in terms of qfi , by considering a weak resonant oscillating field of strength brf=150nt perpendicular to earth s magnetic field , which can completely disorient the bird @xcite . here",
    "we also take the singlet state @xmath92 as the initial state of rp as an example .",
    "our numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "a1 , and it can be seen that when @xmath185 , the qfi is almost immune to the oscillating field , and when @xmath69 , the qfi with the oscillating field is reduced to some extent compared with that without the oscillating field , but we are not sure whether this reduction of qfi can disrupt the birds or not . however , when @xmath91 , the qfi with the oscillating field reduces significantly .",
    "thus it is safe to say that if the oscillating field is to disorient the bird , it might be approximately @xmath91 , which is consistent with the previous works @xcite .",
    "below , we would further numerically show that when @xmath91 , for an arbitrary initial state of rp , a weak resonant oscillating field orthogonal to the geomagnetic field can highly reduce the value of qfi of the steady state @xmath43 . specifically , we randomly sample 100 initial states and plot in fig .",

    ", @xmath187 is larger than @xmath94 , which implies that a weak resonant oscillating field orthogonal to the geomagnetic field can completely disorient the bird for an arbitrary initial state of rp .",
    "the effect of external magnetic field and oscillating field on the value of qfi for @xmath188 has been discussed in the main text . here",
    "we consider the case @xmath189 , and calculate the corresponding qfi . in this case ,",
    "an approximately analytical expression of qfi can not be obtained , thus we calculate the qfi numerically . through our large numerical calculations , we find that our results are not quite sensitive to what the value of hf coupling is . here",

    "the numerical results are shown in fig .",
    "a3 , and we can see that the qfi of @xmath67 weaker ( @xmath192 t ) and stronger ( @xmath193 t ) fields do almost not change compared with that of geomagnetic field ( @xmath194 t ) , but is highly reduced when a weak resonant oscillating field perpendicular to earth s magnetic field is applied . besides , through our numerical calculations , we find that there is no effect at such weak fields when the oscillating field is parallel to earth s magnetic field .",
    "these results are similar to that without considering the horizontal hf coupling components in the main text .",
    "due to the quantum mechanical nature of rp mechanism , the effect of entanglement on the avian compass has been investigated in terms of the singlet yield @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we reconsider the effect of entanglement on the avian compass in terms of qfi , and use concurrence @xcite to quantify entanglement . the concurrence @xmath195 of two qubits",

    "( 4 ) in the main text . as an example",
    ", we plot the qfi and @xmath199 as functions of the recombination rate @xmath30 for @xmath200 t , @xmath201 , @xmath190 t , and @xmath188 with the rp initial state being the singlet state @xmath92 in fig . a4 .",
    "and we can see from fig .",
    "a4 that entanglement can not help to promote bird orientation , to be more specific , when @xmath30 is smaller , the qfi is relatively larger which actually corresponds to zero entanglement , and when @xmath30 is larger , the qfi is reduced to zero which corresponds to a relatively larger entanglement instead .",
    "it is noted that similar conclusions can be obtained for any other direction angles through our large numerical calculations .",
    "in fact , the behavior of entanglement as a function of @xmath30 can be also seen from the expression of @xmath43 .",
    "specifically , when @xmath30 is small , @xmath43 becomes a separable state ( see eq .",
    "( [ rhobar1 ] ) ) , which implies that there is no entanglement in @xmath43 as shown in fig . a4 .",
    "however , when @xmath30 is large , it can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ rhot ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ rho3 ] ) that @xmath43 becomes the singlet state , because in this case the lifetime of rp ( @xmath202 ) is too short to make a transition between the singlet and triplet states , so the concurrence @xmath199 equals to 1 as shown in fig . a4 .",
    "decoherence is unavoidable for the rp , and now we reconsider its effect on the avian compass in terms of qfi , with the singlet state @xmath92 being the initial state of rp as an example .",
    "specifically , we display three typical classes of independent markovian environmental noise , namely , the amplitude damping noise , dephasing noise and depolarized noise .",
    "we describe the environmental noises by the standard lindblad master equation : @xmath203+\\sum_{i}\\gamma_{i}\\bigl(l_{i}\\rho(t)l_{i}^{\\dag}-\\frac{1}{2}\\{l_{i}^{\\dag}l_{i},\\rho(t)\\}\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath204 ( see eq .

    "firstly , let us examine the effect of uncorrelated amplitude damping noise , with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "and we can see from fig .",
    "a5(a ) that when @xmath212 , the qfi of @xmath67 weaker and stronger fields are almost not changed compared with that of geomagnetic field . moreover , a weak resonant oscillating field @xmath213nt , which is perpendicular to earth s magnetic field , can highly reduce the qfi with @xmath200 t , and the percent decrease of qfi , i.e. , @xmath187 , can be larger than @xmath214 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "a5(a ) , which is large enough to imply that a weak oscillating field can completely disrupt the birds . and for @xmath215 in fig .",
    "a5(b ) , the @xmath67 stronger and weaker fields still have little influences on the value of qfi .",
    "meanwhile , there still exists an obvious difference in the value of qfi with and without the oscillating field , with @xmath187 being larger than @xmath216 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "however , when @xmath217 in fig .",
    "a5(c ) , we can see that although the curves of qfi for different magnetic field intensities overlap completely , it would render the bird almost immune to the weak oscillating field , with @xmath187 being smaller than @xmath218 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "a5(c ) , which can not account for the fact that a weak oscillating field can completely disrupt the avian compass . as a conclusion , the decoherence rate should be smaller than @xmath219 for this amplitude damping noise .",
    "next , we consider the effect of uncorrelated dephasing noise , with the numerical results shown in fig . a6 . from fig .",
    "a6 we can see that the @xmath67 stronger and weaker fields compared with the geomagnetic field have almost no influences on the value of qfi for @xmath220 and @xmath221 . however , the effects of a resonant oscillating field on the value of qfi are different . specifically , from fig .",
    "a6(a ) , we can see that when @xmath212 , the qfi would be highly reduced when the oscillating field is applied , with @xmath187 being larger than @xmath214 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "a6(a ) . and",
    "when @xmath215 , the oscillating field is still able to reduce the value of qfi to some extent , especially when @xmath48 is small , @xmath187 can reach approximately @xmath222 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "but when @xmath217 , we can see from fig .",
    "a6(c ) that bird becomes quite immune to the weak oscillating field with @xmath187 being approximately equal to 0 for large @xmath48 .",
    "thus for this dephasing noise , the decoherence rate should be smaller than @xmath219 .",
    "finally , we consider the effect of uncorrelated depolarized noise , with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "a7 we can see that when @xmath212 , the qfi of @xmath67 weaker and stronger fields are almost unchanged compared with that of geomagnetic field , and the difference in the value of qfi with and without the oscillating field is obvious , with the percent decrease @xmath187 being larger than @xmath223 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "a7(a ) . however , when @xmath224 , on the one hand , the value of qfi is significantly small despite of its insensitivity to the @xmath67 weaker and stronger fields . on the other hand ,",
    "the oscillating field has almost no effect on the value of qfi , with @xmath187 being approximately @xmath225 shown in the inset of fig .",
    "a7(b ) or smaller than @xmath226 shown in the inset of fig .",

    "<S> the present work allows us to understand many things about avian magnetoreception from a fully new perspective of quantum metrology , and provide a new route to establish a direct connection between quantum information and many other biological functions .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_. recent evidence suggests that some unique features of quantum mechanics can be harnessed to enhance biological functions in a large variety of living organisms , e.g. , in natural selection @xcite , olfaction sense @xcite , enzymatic reactions @xcite , photosynthetic light harvesting @xcite , avian magnetoreception @xcite , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , which indicates that quantum biology has been entering a new stage @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as one of the principal models of avian magnetoreception , the radical pair ( rp ) mechanism @xcite , based on singlet - triplet transitions due to the anisotropic hyperfine ( hf ) interaction , suggests that migratory birds depend on the photoinduced rps for navigation , which has been supported by intensive evidences and behavioral experiments with birds @xcite . due to the quantum mechanical nature of rp model , a growing interest in understanding the function of avian magnetoreception has extended from chemists , biologists to physicists , by using the rich fruits in the field of quantum information such as quantum coherence and entanglement @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , a deeper understanding of the mechanism of avian magnetoreception may need the ability to precisely measure the function of avian compass . with the development of various kinds of quantum techniques , particularly in the field of quantum metrology @xcite , which has primarily been developed to find the fundamental limit to precision of estimating an unknown parameter , </S>",
    "<S> can we use the method of quantum metrology to precisely characterize the sensitivity of avian magnetoreception ?    in this letter , we apply quantum metrology to avian magnetoreception , and use the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) to give a precise measure of sensitivity of avian magnetoreception , which represents the maximum information about the geomagnetic field direction extracted from the rp state . such an approach allows us to establish a quantitative connection between the performance of avian compass and the magnitude of qfi . </S>",
    "<S> although there have been a few works which noticed the potential relevance between quantum metrology and biology @xcite , we have not see any relevant works to date which really characterized the magnetic sensitivity of avian compass by means of quantum metrology . in the context of rp model , </S>",
    "<S> we first derive a statistical average state ( i.e. , a steady state ) of rp , then calculate the qfi of this state and finally compare the results with the relevant experimental results . the highly consistency between the behavior of qfi and the experimental results </S>",
    "<S> underlies a decisive role played by the qfi in avian magnetoreception . </S>",
    "<S> besides , within the framework of quantum metrology , we can judge the feasibility of any possible measurement scheme for avian magnetoreception , and shed light on an intriguing connection between the conventional approach ( i.e. , the singlet yield ) @xcite and a concrete measurement scheme of our approach .    </S>",
    "<S> _ rp model and its statistical average state_. in the avian compass , each photoinduced rp has a spatially separated electron pair coupled to an external magnetic field @xmath1 and a few nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> generally it is believed that only one of the electrons interacts with the nuclei with an anisotropic hf coupling and the other is free @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus this provides asymmetry and leads to singlet - triplet transition required for the directional sensitivity . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we only consider the simple case of one nuclear spin and the corresponding hamiltonian for each rp is @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the external magnetic field around the rp , @xmath4 is the gyromagnetic ratio , with @xmath5 being the bohr s magneton and @xmath6 being the @xmath7 factor of electron . here </S>",
    "<S> , we assume that the @xmath7 factor is the same for both electronic spins and set its value according to free electron , i.e. , @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath9 are the electronic spin operators ( @xmath10 ) , and @xmath11 is the nuclear spin @xmath12 operator . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath13 is the hf tensor which couples the nuclear spin and electron 2 with a diagonal form @xmath14 , and we assume an axially symmetric ( or cigar - shaped ) hf tensor , i.e. , @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> the rp density matrix at time @xmath16 can then be described as @xmath17,\\ ] ] where @xmath18 is the evolution operator corresponding to the hamiltonian eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) , and @xmath19 $ ] means taking the trace over the nucleus . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is the initial state of two electrons and one nucleus , and generally the nucleus is initially in a complete mixed state , i.e. , @xmath21 .    </S>",
    "<S> first we assume that the rps are identical and in the same initial state . </S>",
    "<S> due to the continuous optical excitation , the creation of each rp is entirely accidental and its decay is also random . </S>",
    "<S> however , with respect to all the rps existing in the bird s eye , they would be in a steady state . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> , we would derive a statistical average state of rp to describe this steady state . to be more specific , </S>",
    "<S> choosing an arbitrary fixed time to see ( here we set the fixed time as the reference time , denoted as @xmath22 ) , the rps at the reference time ( @xmath22 ) are constituted of those evolved from different time @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) , i.e. , the moment of rp formation . </S>",
    "<S> it is reasonable to assume that in time regime @xmath23@xmath25@xmath26 , the number of rps created by optical excitation is a constant which is not dependent on the specific time @xmath23 , denoted by @xmath27 . and </S>",
    "<S> the number of them which still exist ( not decay ) at the reference time is @xmath28 , where @xmath29 , with @xmath30 being the recombination rate @xcite . in other words , for each rp created by optical excitation in time regime @xmath23@xmath25@xmath26 , its existing probability at the reference time is @xmath31 and the corresponding state at the reference time ( @xmath22 ) is described as @xmath32 which is evolved from the time regime @xmath23@xmath25@xmath26 . due to the fact that each rp is subject to the optical excitation randomly , at the reference time </S>",
    "<S> , the state of the rp would be consisted of a large number of states evolved from different time @xmath23 with a corresponding weight @xmath33 . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> we can obtain a statistical average state ( i.e. , the steady state ) of rp : @xmath34 where in the second equation , we have replaced the integration variable @xmath23 with @xmath35 , and accordingly @xmath32 is equal to @xmath36 defined in eq . </S>",

    "<S> here it is noted that @xmath37 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ magnetic sensitivity quantified by qfi_. for the avian compass , the estimated parameter is the geomagnetic field orientation to the basis of hf tensor . and </S>",
    "<S> according to the quantum parameter estimation theory ( refer to appendix a for a brief introduction ) , the qfi for estimating an unknown parameter @xmath38 can be obtained as @xcite @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the parameter dependent state , with @xmath41 being its eigenstate and @xmath42 its corresponding eigenvalue . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we would calculate the qfi of the steady state @xmath43 of rp . in the main text </S>",
    "<S> , we only consider a simple case where @xmath44 ( and the case @xmath45 is considered in appendix c ) . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the geomagnetic field can be described as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the intensity of the geomagnetic field , and @xmath48 and @xmath49 describe the orientation of the geomagnetic field to the basis of hf tensor . </S>",
    "<S> the axial symmetry of hf tensor allows us to set @xmath50 and focus on @xmath48 in the range @xmath51 $ ] without loss of generality , and @xmath48 is the parameter to be estimated for the avian compass . </S>",
    "<S> and then we can calculate the qfi of the steady state @xmath43 of rp under the influence of the geomagnetic field , and in this case , @xmath52 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) . in most previous studies of avian compass , </S>",
    "<S> the recombination rate @xmath30 is generally considered to be the order of @xmath53 . and </S>",
    "<S> in this regime , for an arbitrary initial state of rp @xmath54 , an approximate expression of qfi of the steady state @xmath43 can be obtained , by making a strong hf coupling approximation , i.e. , @xmath55 ( the detailed derivation of qfi can be seen in appendix b ) : @xmath56^{2}(\\frac{1}{\\rho_{i}^{11}}+\\frac{1}{\\rho_{i}^{22}})+\\frac{(\\rho_{i}^{11}-\\rho_{i}^{22})^{2}}{\\rho_{i}^{11}+\\rho_{i}^{22}},\\ ] ] where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 , with @xmath59 ( @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 ( @xmath10 ) being the eigenstates of @xmath62 of electron 2 and hamiltonian of electron 1 , i.e. , @xmath63 , respectively , and @xmath64 $ ] represents the real part of @xmath65 . from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qfia ] ) we can see that for any given initial state @xmath54 , the qfi of the steady state @xmath43 is not dependent on @xmath47 , which implies that the change of the intensity of external magnetic field @xmath47 would not disorient the bird permanently . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the experimental result that bird can adapt to different magnetic field intensities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , without making any approximation , we numerically plot the qfi for different magnetic field intensities with the rp initial state being the singlet state @xmath66 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 as an example . </S>",
    "<S> we can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the @xmath67 weaker ( 32.2@xmath68 t ) and stronger ( 59.8@xmath68 t ) fields @xcite compared with the geomagnetic field ( 46@xmath68 t ) have almost no influences on the value of qfi , that is , bird would not disorient when the intensity of magnetic field is decreased or increased by about @xmath67 of that of geomagnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , the above results also hold .        </S>",
    "<S> next , we would investigate the influence of an additional weak resonant oscillating field , and in this case , @xmath71 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ h ] ) with @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the strength of oscillating field with frequency @xmath74 being resonant with the free electron . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath75 and @xmath76 represent the direction of oscillating field with respect to the basis of hf tensor . due to the axial symmetry of hf </S>",
    "<S> tensor we set @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we consider @xmath78 , i.e. , the weak oscillating field is perpendicular to earth s magnetic field . in this case , when @xmath30 is in the regime @xmath53 , for an arbitrary initial state of rp @xmath54 , we can also obtain an approximate expression of qfi of the steady state @xmath43 , by making a strong hf coupling approximation ( see appendix b for a detailed derivation ) : @xmath79 ^ 2}{(k^2+\\omega^2)^2}\\bigl(\\frac{1}{p_{i}^{11}}+\\frac{1}{p_{i}^{22}}\\bigr)+\\frac{(p_{i}^{11}-p_{i}^{22})^2}{p_{i}^{11}+p_{i}^{22 } } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 , @xmath81 , with @xmath82 having been defined below eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qfia ] ) , @xmath83 $ ] ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) , and @xmath86 $ ] represents the imaginary part of @xmath65 . through our calculation , we obtain that when @xmath87 ( without the oscillating field ) , eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qfibrf ] ) reduces to eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ qfia ] ) ; when @xmath88 , qfi@xmath890 , which implies that when the order of @xmath30 is much smaller than that of @xmath90 , the weak resonant oscillating field can completely disorient the bird . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that the present conclusions are also not dependent on the specific kind of initial state of rp .    </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , without making any approximation , for @xmath91 , we numerically plot the qfi with the weak resonant oscillating field orthogonal to the geomagnetic field in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 , for the rp initial state being the singlet state @xmath92 as an example . </S>",
    "<S> we can see from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 that the value of qfi is highly reduced when the weak resonant oscillating field is applied , which satisfies the experimental result that a weak resonant oscillating field can disrupt the bird completely @xcite . besides , we find that the oscillating field parallel to earth s magnetic field does not affect the value of qfi which is consistent with the experimental results @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize that in appendix b , we not only discuss the order of @xmath30 in terms of qfi , and obtain that @xmath30 should be the order of @xmath93 , which is in accordance with the previous works @xcite , but also numerically show that when @xmath91 , for an arbitrary initial state of rp , a weak resonant oscillating field orthogonal to the geomagnetic field can reduce the value of qfi by at least @xmath94 of that without the oscillating field .    _ </S>",
    "<S> discussionpossible implementations for avian compass_. in this letter , we use the qfi to quantify the magnetic sensitivity of avian compass , but it is only an upper bound of precision for magnetoreception . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , there may exists several possible implementations , and what specific kind of implementation is adopted by birds in nature is not clear for us , despite of the prevailing view that the external magnetic field information can be recorded by the singlet yield @xcite which can be detected by birds . </S>",
    "<S> given that the initial state of rp is in the singlet state @xmath92 , we give two possible implementations as examples here , which are the measurement of total angular momentum and that of the square of total magnetic moment .    </S>",
    "<S> when a specific povm measurement , corresponding to the observable @xmath95 , has been performed , the unknown parameter @xmath48 can be estimated from the mean value of @xmath95 , with the precision given by the standard error propagation formula @xmath96 @xcite , where @xmath97 and @xmath98 represent the variance and mean value of the observable @xmath95 obtained for @xmath43 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we give the measurement of total angular momentum , i.e. , @xmath99 . here it should be noted that @xmath100 , with @xmath101 representing the probability that the rp is found in the singlet state @xmath92 , besides , it can be seen from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rhoba ] ) that @xmath102 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the widely used signal contrast @xmath103 @xcite , which denotes the difference between the maximum and the minimum singlet yields along all the directions , is actually corresponding to the measurement of @xmath104 . moreover , </S>",
    "<S> through our calculations , we find that @xmath105 is equal to the inverse of the classical fisher information @xmath106 . </S>",
    "<S> although the signal contrast @xmath107 and the classical fisher information f(1/@xmath105 ) both describe the magnetic sensitivity of avian compass , f(1/@xmath105 ) , which denotes the maximum information about @xmath48 extracted from the steady state of rp for this measurement scheme , is more accurate and can better reflect the essence of avian magnetoreception than @xmath107 . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results of @xmath108 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , and we can see that the @xmath67 stronger and weaker fields compared with earth s magnetic field almost have no influences on the value of @xmath108 , however , a weak resonant oscillating field perpendicular to earth s magnetic field reduces the value of @xmath108 dramatically .        </S>",
    "<S> next , we give the measurement of the square of magnetic moment , i.e. , @xmath109 , where @xmath110 and @xmath111 represent the @xmath112 component of spin angular momentum of electron 1 and 2 of rp , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> when the initial state of rp is in the singlet state @xmath92 , @xmath113 . in this case , the measurement of @xmath114 can be considered as a sense of fluctuation of magnetic moment , for @xmath115 . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted that @xmath105 is also equal to the inverse of the classical fisher information @xmath106 through our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> our numerical results of @xmath108 are shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , and we can see that @xmath108 is robust to different magnetic field intensities , but would be highly reduced when a weak resonant oscillating field is applied . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , in the spirit of this line , we can judge the feasibility of any possible measurement scheme for avian magnetoreception by comparing the corresponding measurement results with the relevant experiment results .    </S>",
    "<S> _ other results_. following the present insight that the qfi can well quantify the magnetic sensitivity of avian compass , it is possible to study the effects of entanglement and different decoherence models on the value of qfi in a unified picture . </S>",
    "<S> here we also take the singlet state @xmath92 as the initial state of rp as an example . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we find that for an arbitrary direction angle @xmath48 , when @xmath30 is small , the qfi is relatively large while the entanglement is equal to 0 , however , when @xmath30 is large , the entanglement becomes large while the qfi reduces to 0 , which implies that entanglement can not help to promote bird orientation ( a detailed discussion can be seen in appendix d ) . </S>",
    "<S> next , we investigate the effects of three typical classes of independent markovian environmental noise on the value of qfi , namely , the amplitude damping noise , dephasing noise and depolarized noise . by comparing our numerical results with the experimental observations , we find that for the amplitude damping noise and the dephasing noise , the decoherence rate should be smaller than 10@xmath30 , while for the depolarized noise , the decoherence rate should even be smaller than @xmath30 ( a detailed discussion can be seen in appendix e ) </S>",
    "<S> .    _ summary and outlook_. as a precise measure of avian compass , the qfi essentially determines the ability of migratory birds to sense the direction of earth s magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> compared with the conventional phenomenological approach where the magnetic sensitivity is quantified by the signal contrast @xmath103 , our approach proves more accurate and can better reflect the essence of avian magnetoreception . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , in this unified approach of qfi , the order of the recombination rate and the effects of entanglement and decoherence on avian magnetoreception can be well understood . </S>",
    "<S> considering that the qfi is only an upper bound of precision for directional detection , it is desirable to seek for a potential measurement scheme to characterize the compass sensitivity . in the spirit of our approach , we can judge the feasibility of any possible measurement scheme for avian magnetoreception , and have found that the conventional phenomenological approach , i.e , the singlet yield , is just one of the several feasible measurement schemes . then an open question naturally arises : is the widely used singlet yield the optimal choice for describing the sensitivity of avian compass in a practical way ? we hope that our approach can provide a new route to apply the qfi into many other biological processes , such that a precise measure of biological function can be given , and a more profound understanding of biological phenomena can be obtained , which may in turn give us a few clues in the quest to develop quantum technology .    _ </S>",
