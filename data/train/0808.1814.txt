    "in this paper we consider the problem of discrete methods for dealing with functions that are intrinsically almost periodic , but not actually periodic .",
    "quasicrystals , quasicrystalline photonic crystals , faraday wave experiments , and other physical phenomena arising from the interaction of incommensurate frequencies , all display the features of almost periodicity . as a typical example one may think of a potential field of a physical quasicrystal .",
    "the salient features of quasicrystals are highly structured long - range order ( represented by pure point or near pure point diffraction ) but no periodic order .",
    "thus the potential is not a periodic function , but rather belongs to the domain of almost periodic functions .",
    "here we put forth a method for finite discrete analysis of almost periodic functions that has the following main features :    * it is entirely based on group theoretical methods , primarily finite groups and their duals . *",
    "the discretely computed fourier approximants are themselves almost periodic and uniformly approximate their target functions over their entire domains . *",
    "the fourier frequencies involved in the approximation lie in the module of fourier frequencies of the target function .",
    "a standard approach to modeling such structures is to take a finite part of it , impose periodic boundary conditions , rationalize and reduce the object to a periodic approximant , and then apply usual crystallography .",
    "although this type of periodization is used routinely and successfully for many modelling problems in the theory of quasicrystals , it is not entirely satisfactory .",
    "almost periodic order goes beyond periodic order in fundamental ways , its essence appearing as a underlying incommensurability which pervades every part of the theory .",
    "for instance , a key feature of quasicrystals appears in the fourier module which parameterizes the bragg spectrum and always has rank higher than ( typically double ) the dimension of the ambient space of the quasicrystal .",
    "periodization destroys this , and by its nature can only produce results that can fit data over the finite range specified by the imposed periodization boundaries , whereas the essence of the material is that its order is long - range",
    ". the present paper does not involve any periodization and avoids these issues .",
    "the theory of almost periodic functions was initiated by h.  bohr @xcite , on the basis of earlier work on uniform approximation of functions by trigonometric polynomials by p. bohl .",
    "it was greatly extended by the work of a.  besicovitch @xcite , s.  bochner , j.  von neumann , @xcite , n.  wiener @xcite , h.  weyl @xcite , and others @xcite .",
    "the advent of quasicrystals and aperiodic tilings instigated a revival of the field , and led to extensive study of the cut and project formalism and the theory of pure point diffraction @xcite which have become the mainstays of experimentalists and theorists alike .",
    "an important component of this is the use of dynamical systems and dynamical hulls .",
    "these are ideally suited to the phenomenon of almost periodicity , which appears in the dynamics as recurrence , and provide a natural setting for the fourier analysis that is used to study it .",
    "although our study is of almost periodic functions , their importance in the subject of quasicrystals is that they arise from functions whose behaviour is dominated by the local environments of the quasicrystal in question .",
    "the way in which this happens is mostly taken for granted , but in fact there are some interesting assumptions involved , and for this reason we begin by formally defining local functions with respect to a given point set @xmath0 , and showing how it is that they are connected with almost periodic functions .",
    "we can create a _ dynamical hull _",
    "@xmath1 from @xmath0 .",
    "this is a compact space that arises from @xmath0 and its translations , and it lies at the heart of the fourier analysis of local functions on @xmath0",
    ". one assumes ( in many important cases it is forced ) a probability measure @xmath2 on which @xmath3 acts in a measure preserving way .",
    "a local function @xmath4 lifts to some new function @xmath5 on @xmath1 , and this is an @xmath6 function .",
    "now the analysis of @xmath4 can be related directly to the analysis of @xmath5 , and for this we have a powerful tool in the form of the action of @xmath3 on @xmath7 , which is unitary .",
    "all of this material is explained in  2 .    to go further , we next place ourselves in the situation of the cut and project formalism , which is the standard method of modeling used in the study of quasicrystals .",
    "the set @xmath0 is now assumed to be a model set ( cut and project set ) . in this setting the hull @xmath1 , and more particularly @xmath7 , can be described explicitly in terms of a higher dimensional torus(higher dimensional periodicity ! ) , and it is a straightforward matter to carry out fourier analysis of @xmath5 . it is the restriction of this fourier analysis back to @xmath4 that provides the required fourier analysis of @xmath4 . by its very nature this is almost periodic and captures the full aperiodic nature of @xmath0 , including the correct fourier module in which physical information actually appears .",
    "this is the content of  3 .",
    "readers familiar with the cut and project method who do not wish to go through the theory of local hulls and local functions may read  [ cpsmstp ] and  [ fouriercoefficients ] , and then continue starting at  [ discretization ] .",
    "this theoretical analysis is based on higher dimensional structures that are not explicitly computatable , as well as the usual array of countably many fourier coefficients , each of which is the outcome of integration . to be a practical tool",
    ", the analysis has to be reduced to finitely many objects that are explicitly computable entirely in the context of the given function @xmath4 .",
    "the resulting approximants are trigonometric polynomials ( quasi - periodic functions ) whose frequencies come from the fourier module of the original function . in ",
    "4 we outline the method of discretization , which depends primarily on the construction of a refinement lattice of the lattice of the cut and project scheme and , along with it , its dual lattice . together",
    "these produce two finite groups which are in @xmath8-duality to each other .",
    "the selection of data points and appropriate fourier frequencies is governed by these two groups .",
    "this is best illustrated by examples and for this we have chosen two local functions based on one of the famous fibonacci point sets .",
    "this has the advantage of being straightforward to construct and easy to visualize , while at the same time containing all the essential features of more general model sets .",
    " 5 prepares the mathematics of the fibonacci cut and project scheme , and  6 shows some explicit computations for the particular local functions we have chosen .",
    "as is evident from the examples , the main effort required is in the creation of the data points .",
    "once this is done , the same set of data points and fourier frequencies will work for any almost periodic function arising from the same cut and project scheme .",
    "the results are striking in two ways .",
    "first of all , the approximating functions are remarkably good , given the amount of data from which they are produced .",
    "second , the approximating functions are not just local approximations they are also _ global _ approximations , in the sense that they provide finite fourier series that approximate @xmath4 throughout its entire domain ( namely @xmath9 ) .",
    "of course this was to be expected , but it is impressive to see it in action .",
    "the numerical methods we introduce here are designed to be efficient and , of course , to utilize the inherent almost periodicity . in the development of the theory we provide error estimates that can be worked out specifically in the cases of interest .",
    "we note that the primary weakness in the error estimates is not one that is due to the aperiodic nature of the problem , but one that always appears in fourier analysis , namely how well can one approximate a function if one uses only finitely many of its fourier coefficients .",
    "[ hulls ] we work in @xmath3 , a real euclidean space of finite dimension @xmath10 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath12 , be all point sets @xmath13 for which the distance @xmath14 for all @xmath15 .",
    "this means that @xmath16 consists of all discrete point sets with minimal separation @xmath17 between their points .",
    "the _ local topology _ on @xmath12 can be intuitively introduced as follows .",
    "two sets @xmath18 and @xmath19 of @xmath12 are ` close ' if , for some large @xmath20 and some small @xmath21 , one has @xmath22 where @xmath23 ( resp .",
    "@xmath24 ) is the ball of radius @xmath20 ( resp .",
    "@xmath21 ) around @xmath25 .",
    "thus for each point of @xmath18 within the ball @xmath23 , there is a point of @xmath19 within the distance @xmath21 of that point ; and vice versa .",
    "pairs @xmath26 satisfying are called @xmath27-close .     and @xmath19 of @xmath12 that are close .",
    "]    the local topology is actually a metric topology , although we make no use of this fact here .",
    "for @xmath28 the _ local hull _ of @xmath0 is @xmath29 i.e. take all translates of @xmath0 and take their closure in the local topology .",
    "@xcite the translation action of @xmath3 on @xmath0 lifts to a translation action on @xmath30 .",
    "the local hull @xmath30 is compact and the @xmath3-action on it is continuous .",
    "let @xmath0 be the lattice @xmath31 in @xmath3 .",
    "then @xmath32 is the @xmath10-torus ( with its usual topology ) .",
    "intuitively we translate the lattice around with @xmath3 . but translation by an element of @xmath31 leaves @xmath0 invariant .",
    "so @xmath33 parameterizes all distinct positions of @xmath0 under translation .",
    "let @xmath0 be any penrose tiling .",
    "then @xmath30 is the set of all penrose tilings that are locally indistinguishable from some translate of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath30 contains considerably more than just the translations of @xmath0 .",
    "in fact @xmath30 consists of all penrose tilings based on the same pair of penrose rhombs and the same orientations as appearing in @xmath0 .",
    "generally one may think of @xmath30 as some sort of local indistinguishability class of @xmath0 .",
    "we assume that @xmath34 and @xmath30 are as in  [ hulls ] .",
    "consider a function @xmath35 we can define from it a function @xmath36 by @xmath37 if @xmath5 is continuous then we note that for all @xmath38 , @xmath39 thus continuity of @xmath5 implies continuity of @xmath4 , and we see that @xmath4 is local , or almost periodic , with respect to @xmath0 in the following sense :    a function @xmath40 is called _ local with respect to a set @xmath28 _ , or @xmath0-_local _ , if for all @xmath41 there exist @xmath20 and @xmath21 so that whenever @xmath38 satisfy that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are @xmath27-close then latexmath:[\\[\\begin{gathered }     the intuitive meaning of this is that @xmath4 has the very natural property , at least from the perspective of physical systems , that it looks very much the same at places where the local environment looks the same .",
    "local functions are easily seen to be continuous on @xmath3 .",
    "using locality , we can go in the opposite direction .",
    "let @xmath28 and let @xmath45 be local with respect to @xmath0 .",
    "define @xmath46 ( so that @xmath5 is a function on a part of @xmath12 ) by @xmath47 then @xmath5 is continuous on @xmath48 with respect to the local topology .",
    "in fact it is _ uniformly _ continuous .",
    "the reason for this is that the continuity condition which defines the local - ness of @xmath4 is based on the uniformity ( i.e. the notion of @xmath27-closeness ) defining the local topology of @xmath48 .",
    "it follows that @xmath5 lifts uniquely to a continuous function on the local hull @xmath30 .    for each local function @xmath4 with respect to @xmath0",
    "there is a unique continuous function on the local hull , whose restriction to the orbit of @xmath0 is @xmath4 .",
    "every continuous function on the local hull of @xmath0 arises in this way .",
    "thus we see that a locality with respect to @xmath0 and the existence and continuity of an extension function on @xmath30 amount to the same thing .",
    "in the situation that @xmath30 is equipped with an @xmath3-invariant probability measure @xmath2 ( i.e. a positive borel measure @xmath2 with @xmath49 for all borel sets and with @xmath50 ) , the action of @xmath3 on @xmath30 leads to unitary action @xmath51 of @xmath3 on @xmath52 .",
    "namely for all @xmath53 and for all @xmath54 , @xmath55 is the function defined by @xmath56 and with @xmath57 we have @xmath58    in principle the spectral theory of @xmath52 should allow one analyze @xmath0-local functions @xmath59 by analyzing their corresponding functions @xmath5 on @xmath52 .",
    "for one very important class of subsets @xmath0 this can actually be carried out in detail  namely the class of model sets , which we now introduce .",
    "an important class of point sets @xmath60 for which we know a considerable amount about the corresponding hulls @xmath30 is the class of cut and project sets , or the model sets as they are often called @xcite .",
    "consider the cut and project scheme @xmath61 and a window @xmath62 . here",
    "@xmath63 is a lattice in @xmath64 which is oriented so that the projections into @xmath3 are @xmath65 and dense respectively .    in ( [ cps ] )",
    "the left - hand @xmath3 is _ physical space _ , the space in which @xmath0 is going to lie .",
    "the right - hand @xmath3 is _ internal space _ , the one that will be used to control the projection of the lattice @xmath63 into physical space . the image of @xmath63 under projection into physical space is denoted by @xmath66 .",
    "since this projection is one - one , @xmath67 as groups , so @xmath66 is a free abelian group of rank @xmath68 , i.e. it has a @xmath8-basis of @xmath68 elements .",
    "however , it necessarily has accumulation points , and the typical situation is that @xmath66 is dense in physical space .",
    "it is convenient to use notation like @xmath69 for the elements of @xmath70 and their respective left and right projections .",
    "then @xmath71 where @xmath72 runs through @xmath66 .",
    "this implies existence of the mapping @xmath73 defined by @xmath74 , which passes from physical to internal space .",
    "note that this mapping @xmath75 , as given , is only defined on @xmath66 .",
    "it can not be extended in any canonical way to a mapping @xmath76 .",
    "however it does extend canonically to the rational spans of the objects in question , and we shall make use of this later .",
    "we choose a subset @xmath62 in internal space .",

    "thus these model sets are parameterized by the torus of dimension @xmath68 , @xmath83 we note , though , that the parametrization need not necessarily be @xmath65 , i.e. in general , @xmath84 . in the sequel , for simplicity , we shall usually write @xmath85 for the congruence class @xmath86    there is a natural measure , the haar measure , @xmath87 on @xmath88 .",

    "we shall see how this looks in particular examples .",
    "it should be noted that although getting the computational details set up is somewhat involved , these details depend only on the cut and project scheme and the degree of accuracy required from the computation .",
    "once this is established the data points and choices of frequencies are already determined , and they suffice for the fourier analysis of _ all _ functions that arise out of the same almost periodic family , and are algorithmically easy to compute .",
    "we begin with the cut and project scheme with torus @xmath88 and note the natural extension of the mapping @xmath185 to the rational span of the module @xmath66 : @xmath186    we assume that @xmath187 is supplied with the standard dot product ( denoted @xmath188 ) , and then define the dual lattice : @xmath189    then @xmath130 is a @xmath8-module of the same rank as @xmath133 , namely @xmath68 .",

    "the approximation then works by throwing away the term which involves @xmath202 in .",

    "however , if we had used an element of @xmath30 at which the torus map were @xmath65 ( and this is the case with probabilistic certainty if one chooses randomly from @xmath30 ) then this phenomenon would not occur and the approximation would be uniformly valid over the entire space . all one need do is to shift the window so that its end points do not lie in the set @xmath144 $ ] , e.g. @xmath441 $ ] .",
    "we should point out that there is considerable scope for adapting the scenario sketched out here .",
    "it is possible to arrange things so that they are related to tilings .",
    "one elegant tiling method is the klotz construction @xcite .",
    "one begins with the decomposition into voronoi cells of the lattice @xmath131 in @xmath191 , and along with it the corresponding dual cell decomposition into delone cells . for each pair of @xmath442 consisting of intersecting @xmath10-dimensional faces @xmath443 and @xmath444 from a voronoi cell and a delone cell respectively , form the _ klotz _ @xmath445 in @xmath191 .",
    "the set of these kltze form a tiling of @xmath191 .",
    "furthermore the intersection of @xmath446 with this tiling produces a tiling of physical space .",
    "( if one chooses instead to do the projections the other way around , one gets a different tiling ) .",
    "several of these kltze can be combined to form a fundamental region for @xmath191 , as we see in fig .",
    "7 , and this type of choice should lead to computational methods that are adapted to the these tilings .",
    "for instance , the region @xmath118 of integration might well be chosen as the union of a finite number of tiles . for more on determining voronoi and delone cells in the context of high symmetry ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the method advocated here is based on the idea of local functions , the extending of them into the context of compact abelian groups , and the discretization of the resulting fourier analysis by the use of finite groups . in the 1d setting that was explored in detail here , the only symmetries involved arise from translational symmetry ( which is at the base of the almost periodicity ) . in higher dimensions , especially those of interest to the quasicrystal community , decagonal , icosahedral , or",
    "other symmetries appear . in these cases",
    "there are a number of ways of utilizing the symmetry to greatly improve the efficiency of the computation , in the same spirit as @xcite . as we have pointed out , the preparations required for this depend largely on the cut and project scheme and not so much on the actual model set involved .",
    "fortunately the cut and project schemes for these settings are essentially canonical and their strong algebraic nature makes this program quite feasible .",
    "finally , although we have not spelled it out here , the way in which finite groups and their duals are used here makes the process amenable to the technique of the fast fourier transform .",
