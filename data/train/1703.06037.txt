    "@xcite + in this work we clarified the impact of trap - assisted recombination on cwpa , with the aim of enabling investigation of bulk recombination using this contactless experiment .",

    "combined with the fact that the quadrature in this regime does nt depend strongly on the reaction order , it is motivated to only focus on the high intensity and low frequency ( near steady state ) behavior .",
    "while equation  [ grundro ] describes direct recombination , trap - assisted recombination does nt follow a constant reaction order , instead it varies depending on the physical circumstances .",
    "the rate for this recombination will depend on the density of free carriers ( @xmath63 or @xmath64 ) and trapped carriers of opposite charge ( @xmath65 or @xmath66 ) and be proportional to @xmath67 or @xmath68 .",
