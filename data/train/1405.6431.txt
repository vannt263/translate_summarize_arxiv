    "and rare cascading blackouts are complicated sequences of dependent outages that successively weaken a power system .",
    "they have substantial risk and pose great challenges in simulation , analysis , and mitigation @xcite@xcite .",
    "simulations of cascading outages from various models , such as opa model [ [ opa1]][[opa4 ] ] , ac opa [ [ ac opa ] ] , [ [ ac opa1 ] ] , opa with slow process @xcite , manchester model @xcite , hidden failure model @xcite , @xcite , and dynamic model @xcite , can produce massive amounts of data regarding line outages , generator tripping , and load shedding",
    ". however , simulations can not produce statistical insight or metrics with actionable information without a carefully designed information extraction method .",
    "existing such methods include the interaction network and interaction model @xcite , @xcite , the influence graph @xcite , and the branching processes @xcite@xcite . among these methods ,",
    "branching processes have descriptive parameters that characterize the system resilience to cascading .",
    "it is much more time efficient by first estimating the parameters of a branching process from a shorter simulation run and then predicting the distribution of total outages using the branching process than empirically estimating the distribution .",
    "branching processes can efficiently predict the distribution of line outages and the load shed of simulations from opa and its variants on the ieee 118- and 300-bus systems , and northeastern power grid of china @xcite[[bp13 ] ] , the distribution of the load shed for the trelss simulation on an industrial system of about 6250 buses @xcite , and the distribution of line outages in real data @xcite .    till now the branching process has only been used to describe the propagation of one type of outages . in real cascading blackouts , however , several outages such as line outages , load shedding , and isolated buses can exist simultaneously .",
    "more importantly , these outages are usually interdependent , because of which the propagation of cascading outages can be better understood only when these outages can be described jointly .",
    "also , if we want to evaluate the time needed to restore the system after a cascading outage event , we need to know how many buses and lines are still in service , as well as the amount of the load shed .",
    "but we may not have all these data and thus need to predict some of them by only using the available data .    in this paper , line outages ,",
    "the load shed , and isolated buses , are described by galton - watson multi - type branching processes @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the parameters of branching processes are estimated by the expectation maximization ( em ) algorithm @xcite .",
    "the joint distributions of total outages are efficiently estimated by multi - type branching processes via the lagrange - good inversion @xcite .",
    "we also show that the multi - type branching process can effectively predict the distribution of the load shed and isolated buses when there are no data for them .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ g - w bp ] briefly introduces the multi - type galton - watson branching processes .",
    "section [ estimating ] explains the estimating of branching process parameters .",
    "section [ total pdf ] discusses the estimation of the joint distribution of total outages by multi - type branching processes .",
    "section [ num needed ] determines how many cascades should be simulated and how many should be utilized to estimate the joint distribution by branching processes .",
    "section [ simulation ] tests the proposed method with simulated cascades of line outages , the load shed , and isolated buses by ac opa on the ieee 118-bus system .",
    "finally the conclusion is drawn in section [ conclusion ] .",
    "here , we will briefly introduce the galton - watson branching process , especially the multi - type galton - watson branching process . for more details ,",
    "the reader is referred to @xcite@xcite . as a high - level probabilistic model",
    ", the branching process can statistically describe how the number of outages propagate in a cascading blackout .",
    "its simplicity allows a high - level understanding of the cascading process without getting entangled in complicated mechanisms of cascading .    for one - type branching process , the initial outages propagate randomly to produce subsequent outages in generations .",
    "each outage ( a `` parent '' outage ) independently produces a random nonnegative integer number of outages ( `` children '' outages ) in the next generation .",
    "the children outages then become parents to produce another generation until the number of outages in a generation becomes zero .",
    "the distribution of the number of children from one parent is called the _ offspring distribution_. the mean of this distribution is the parameter @xmath0 , which is the average number of children outages for each parent outage and can quantify the tendency for the cascade to propagate in the sense that larger @xmath0 corresponds to faster propagation . for cascading blackout @xmath1 and",
    "the outages will always eventually die out .",
    "the multi - type branching process is a generalization of the one - type branching process .",
    "each type @xmath2 outage in one generation ( a type @xmath2 `` parent '' outage ) independently produces a random nonnegative integer number of outages of the same type ( type @xmath2  children \" outages ) and any other type ( type @xmath3  children \" outages where @xmath4 ) .",
    "all generated outages in different types comprise the next generation .",
    "the process ends when the number of outages in all types becomes zero .    for an @xmath5-type branching process there will be @xmath6 offspring distributions .",
    "correspondingly there will be @xmath6 offspring means , which can be arranged into a matrix called the _ offspring mean matrix _ @xmath7 .",
    "the criticality of the multi - type branching process is determined by the largest eigenvalue of @xmath8 .",
    "the process will always extinct if the largest eigenvalue of @xmath8 is less than or equal to 1 [ [ branching process ] ] , [ [ harris ] ] .",
    "the simulation of opa and its variants [ [ opa1]][[slow ] ] can naturally produce outages in generations .",
    "each iteration of the `` main loop '' of the simulation produces another generation .",
    "a total of @xmath9 cascades are simulated to produce nonnegative integer data that can be arranged as    [ data ]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     & 0.64 & @xmath10 $ ] & 8.54 + [ 4ex ]",
    "in this paper , the multi - type branching process is applied to statistically describe the propagation of line outages , the load shed , and isolated buses .",
    "the largest eigenvalues of the estimated offspring mean matrix for more than one type of outages are greater than the offspring means for one type of outages , indicating that the system is actually closer to criticality and only considering one type of outages will underestimate the extent of outage propagation .",
    "the joint distributions of two types of outages are efficiently estimated by the multi - type branching process with much smaller number of cascades than empirically estimating the joint distribution , which is a significant advantage since simulation time is a limiting factor when studying cascading blackouts .",
    "we also show that the multi - type branching process can effectively predict the distribution of the load shed and isolated buses when there are no data for them .",
    "finally , we demonstrate that a three - type branching process can provide joint analyses on line outages , the load shed , and isolated buses .",
