    "klein @xcite considered the reflection and transmission of electrons of energy @xmath1 incident on the potential step @xmath2 for @xmath3 in the one - dimensional time - independent dirac equation which can be written @xcite in terms of the usual pauli matrices as @xmath4 he found that the reflection and transmission coefficients @xmath5 when the step height @xmath6 were given by @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the kinematic factor @xmath9 @xmath10 is the momentum of the incident electron and @xmath11 is the momentum of the transmitted particle for @xmath12 provided @xmath13 is negative to be negative so that the group velocity of the particle for @xmath14 was positive . ] , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are both positive and satisfy @xmath17 telegdi @xcite has recently reviewed the history of the klein paradox , concentrating on the inaccuracies which followed from choosing the wrong sign of @xmath18 nowadays the paradox is taken to lie in the result that as @xmath19 for fixed @xmath20 tends to a non - zero limit .",
    "the physical essence of the klein paradox thus lies in the prediction that fermions can pass through large repulsive potentials without exponential damping .",
    "this we call klein tunnelling",
    ".       there have been various attempts over the last seventy years to explain the klein paradox . the preferred explanation given by telegdi and in textbooks",
    "@xcite is due to hansen and ravndal @xcite : the left - right asymmetric step emits electron - positron pairs just as a constant electric field does @xcite and it is the inability of an observer to distinguish between this emission and the static scattering properties of the step which gives rise to the paradox .",
    "@xmath21 measures the positrons emitted by the step while @xmath15 is not unity because the pauli principle causes destructive interference between the emitted electron and the reflected electron . in the absence of particle production",
    "@xmath22would indeed be @xmath23 and @xmath21 would be @xmath24       these claims are investigated in this paper .",
    "we begin from a viewpoint which sees no connection between left - right asymmetry and quantum tunnelling , nor indeed any necessary connection between either of these and particle production .",
    "we will seek to show that klein tunnelling is characteristic of relativistic wave equations as such , because negative energy states really do represent physical particles .",
    "our approach in this respect is similar to that of jensen et al @xcite .",
    "we therefore investigate a class of problems in which klein tunnelling takes place even in the absence of particle production .",
    "klein was unfortunate in that he considered a pathological problem which gives misleading results : the potentials we consider can be very similar to a klein step but are better defined and both their time - independent and emission properties can be found simply using eq.([dir ] ) in the presence of a four - potential @xmath25 .",
    "particle emission from strong potentials is well - understood in terms of supercritical positron production @xcite .",
    "a full field theoretic treatment is given in our earlier paper @xcite but provided we restrict ourselves to potentials which are switched on adiabatically we manage here with first quantisation ( except in the appendix where we derive the relation between the transmission coefficient @xmath21 and the current emitted by the step ) .",
    "finally we look at klein tunnelling in the context of the coulomb potential .",
    "consider the square barrier @xmath26 instead of the klein step . for @xmath27 this potential",
    "may be expected to give similar results to those found by klein .",
    "it does , but the results are perhaps surprising .",
    "it is easy to show that the reflection and transmission coefficients for the square barrier are given by @xcite @xmath28    note that klein tunnelling is enhanced for a barrier : if    @xmath29    corresponding to @xmath30 the electron passes right through the barrier with no reflection : this is called a transmission resonance @xcite . as @xmath31 becomes very large for fixed @xmath32 and @xmath33 ,",
    "we can average over the phase angle @xmath34 to find the limit    @xmath35    it may seem unphysical that @xmath36 and @xmath37 are not the same as @xmath15 and @xmath21 but it is not : it is well known in electromagnetic wave theory @xcite that reflection off a transparent barrier of large but finite width ( with 2 sides ) is different from reflection off a transparent step ( with 1 side ) . @xmath36 and",
    "@xmath38 thus involve klein tunnelling but they arise from a more physical problem than the klein step .",
    "the zero of potential is properly defined for a barrier whereas it is arbitrary for a step and the energy spectrum of a barrier is easily calculable .",
    "emission from a barrier or well is described by supercriticality : the condition when the ground state energy of the system overlaps with the continuum ( @xmath39 for a barrier ; @xmath40 for a well ) and so any connection between particle emission and the time - independent scattering coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be investigated .",
    "we discussed this topic in our previous paper @xcite which we refer to as cdi .",
    "we quickly review the argument .",
    "spontaneous fermionic emission is a non - static process and in the case of a seemingly static potential , it is necessary to ask how the potential was switched on from zero .",
    "we follow cdi in turning on the potential adiabatically .       the bound state spectrum for the well @xmath43 is easily obtained @xcite : there are even and odd solutions given by the equations    @xmath44    @xmath45    where now the well momentum is given by @xmath46 .",
    "we have changed the sign of @xmath33 so that it is now attractive to electrons rather than positrons in order to conform with other authors who have studied supercritical positron emission rather than electron emission .",
    "the simplest case to discuss is a very narrow deep well @xmath47 which is the limit of a square well with @xmath48 .",
    "the bound states are then given for even @xmath49 and odd ( @xmath50 wave functions by    @xmath51    when the potential is initially turned on and @xmath52 is small there is one bound state just below @xmath39 . as @xmath52 increases , @xmath1 decreases and at @xmath53 @xmath54 reaches zero . for @xmath55 , @xmath1 becomes negative and if the well were originally vacant , we now have the absence of a negative energy state which we must interpret as the presence of a ( bound ) positron according to dirac s hole theory .",
    "we can use the anticommutation relations for the electron field @xcite to write the charge @xmath56 as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is a c - number called the vacuum charge @xcite@xcite and @xmath59 is the particle ( or normal - ordered ) charge .",
    "the total charge @xmath56 is always conserved .",
    "for @xmath52 just larger than @xmath60 , @xmath61 because of the presence of the positron and so the vacuum charge @xmath58 must now equal @xmath62 to conserve charge@xmath63 as the potential is increased further , @xmath52 will reach @xmath64 here @xmath40 which is the condition for supercriticality : the bound positron reaches the continuum and becomes free .",
    "this is the well - known scenario of spontaneous positron production first discussed @xcite@xcite over 25 years ago .",
    "note that at supercriticality @xmath65 , the even bound state disappears and the first odd state appears .",
    "we can continue to increase @xmath52 and count positrons : the total number of positrons produced for a given @xmath52 is the number of times @xmath1 has crossed @xmath66 that is @xmath67   \\label{charge0}\\ ] ]    where @xmath68 $ ] denotes the integer part of @xmath69 the more interesting quantity for us is the number of supercritical positrons @xmath70 : the number of states which have crossed @xmath40 .",
    "this is given by    @xmath71   \\label{super}\\ ] ]    note that for any @xmath52 there is at most one bound positron state .",
    "we consider the general case of @xmath6 and then look in particular at the case @xmath27 most closely corresponding to the klein step .",
    "we must find first the condition for supercriticality of the potential @xmath33 , and then the number of bound and supercritical positrons produced for a given @xmath72 from eq ( [ even ] ) we see that the ground state becomes supercritical when @xmath73 and therefore @xmath74 from eq ( [ odd ] ) the first odd state becomes supercritical when @xmath75 and @xmath76 clearly the supercritical potential corresponding to the nth positron is    @xmath77    it follows from eq ( [ nth ] ) that @xmath78 is an accumulation point of supercritical states as @xmath79 .",
    "furthermore it is a threshold : a potential @xmath33 is subcritical if @xmath80 .",
    "it is not difficult to show for a given @xmath6 that the number of supercritical positrons is given by    @xmath81   \\label{super2}\\ ] ]    the corresponding value of the total positron charge @xmath59 can be shown u@xmath82 g eqs ( [ even],[odd ] ) to satisfy    @xmath83\\leq q_p   \\label{charge}\\ ] ]    so for large @xmath31 we have the estimates    @xmath84    @xmath85    now we can build up an overall picture of the wide square well @xmath86 . when @xmath33 is turned on from zero in the vacuum state an enormous number of bound states is produced .",
    "as @xmath33 crosses @xmath87 a very large number @xmath88 of these states cross @xmath89 and become bound positrons . as @xmath33 crosses @xmath90",
    "a large number @xmath70 of bound states become supercritical together .",
    "this therefore gives rise to a positively charged current flowing from the well .",
    "but in this case , unlike that of the klein step , the charge in the well is finite and therefore the particle emission process has a finite lifetime .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath91 large enough the transient positron current for a wide barrier is approximately constant in time for a considerable time as we shall see in the next section .",
    "we now restrict ourselves to the case @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "this is not necessary but it avoids having to calculate the dynamics of positron emission while the potential is still increasing beyond the critical value .",
    "we can assume all the positrons are produced almost instantaneously as the potential passes through @xmath94 it also means that the kinematics are non - relativistic .",
    "hence for a sufficiently wide",
    "well so that @xmath95 is large , @xmath96 .",
    "the well momentum of the nth supercritical positron is still given by eq ( [ quant ] ) @xmath97 which corresponds to an emitted positron energy @xmath98 .",
    "note that the emitted energies have discrete values although for @xmath31 large , they are closely spaced .",
    "the lifetime @xmath99 of the supercritical well is given by the time for the slowest positron to get out of the well .",
    "the slowest positron is the deepest lying state with @xmath100 and momentum @xmath101 .",
    "hence @xmath102 so the lifetime is finite but scales as @xmath103 . but",
    "a large number of positrons will have escaped well before @xmath99 .",
    "there are @xmath70 supercritical positrons initially and their average momentum @xmath104 corresponds to @xmath105 ; hence @xmath106 which is independent of @xmath31 .",
    "thus a transient current of positrons is produced which is effectively constant in time for a long time of order @xmath107 @xmath108 .",
    "we thus see that the square well ( or barrier ) for @xmath31 sufficiently large behaves just like the klein step : it emits a seemingly constant current with a seemingly continuous energy spectrum .",
    "but initially the current must build up from zero and eventually must return to zero .",
    "so the well / barrier is a time - dependent physical entity with a finite but long lifetime for emission of supercritical positrons or electrons . in the appendix",
    "we show that if we assume that the transient current emitted is constant in time ( which it is not ) , then it is possible to obtain a relationship between this current and the transmission coefficient just as for the klein step .",
    "note again that the transmission resonances of the time - independent scattering problem coincide with the energies of particles emitted by the well or barrier .",
    "it is therefore tempting to use the pauli principle to explain the connection . following hansen and ravndal",
    ", we could say that @xmath41 must be zero at the resonance energy because the electron state is already filled by the emitted electron with that energy .",
    "but it is easy to show that the reflection coefficient is zero for bosons as well as fermions of that energy , and no pauli principle can work in that case .",
    "furthermore emission ceases after time @xmath99 whereas @xmath109 for times @xmath110 .",
    "it follows that we must conclude that klein tunnelling is a physical phenomenon in its own right , independent of any emission process . in our next section",
    "we consider further ways to investigate this tunnelling theoretically and experimentally .",
    "it is clear from eq ( [ barr ] ) that while the reflection coefficient @xmath41 can not be @xmath111 , neither is the transmission coefficient @xmath42 exponentially small for energies @xmath3 , even though the scattering is classically forbidden .",
    "the simplest way to understand this is to consider the negative energy states under the potential barrier as corresponding to physical particles which can carry energy in exactly the same way that positrons are described by negative energy states which can carry energy .",
    "it follows from eq ( [ rs / ts ] ) that @xmath15 and @xmath21 correspond to reflection and transmission coefficients in transparent media with differing refractive indices : thus @xmath8 is nothing more than an effective fermionic refractive index corresponding to the differing velocities of propagation by particles in the presence and absence of the potential . on this basis",
    ", tuning the momentum @xmath13 to obtain a transmission resonance for scattering off a square barrier is nothing more than finding the frequency for which a given slab of refractive material is tranparent .",
    "this is not a new idea . in jensen s words",
    " a potential hill of sufficient height acts as a fabry - perot etalon for electrons , being completely transparent for some wavelengths , partly or completely reflecting for others  @xcite .",
    "we can now look in more detail at klein tunnelling : both in terms of our model square well / barrier problem and at the analogous coulomb problem .",
    "the interesting region is where the potential is strong but subcritical so that emission dynamics play no role and sensible time independent scattering parameters can be defined . for electrons scattering off the square barrier",
    "@xmath112 we would thus require @xmath113 @xmath114 together with @xmath6 so that positrons can propagate under the barrier .",
    "for the corresponding square well @xmath115 there are negative energy bound states @xmath116 provided that @xmath117 @xmath118 [ cf .",
    "eq.([charge ] ) ] .",
    "so when the potential well is deep enough , it will in fact bind positrons .",
    "correspondingly , a high barrier will bind electrons .",
    "it is thus not surprising that electrons can tunnel through the barrier for strong subcritical potentials since they are attracted by those potential barriers .",
    "another way of seeing this phenomenon is by using the concept of effective potential @xmath119 which is the potential which can be used in a schrodinger equation to simulate the properties of a relativistic wave equation . for a potential @xmath25 introduced as the time - component of a four - vector into a relativistic wave equation ( klein - gordon or dirac ) ,",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath120 hence as the energy @xmath1 changes sign , the effective potential can change from repulsive to attractive .       for the coulomb barrier , anchishkin @xcite has already suggested looking at scattering of @xmath121 off heavy nuclei to see if there was any experimental evidence for tunnelling : the klein - gordon equation like the dirac equation has negative energy solutions , so similar arguments apply .",
    "his calculations show a 20% enhancement in @xmath122 scattering compared with non - relativistic expectations",
    ". the analogous process for fermions would be positron - heavy nucleus scattering . for a positron of initial energy @xmath1 incident on a heavy nucleus of charge @xmath123",
    "the classical turning point @xmath124 so it would be interesting to measure the wave function at the origin for positron scattering off a heavy nucleus compared with the wave function at the origin for electron scattering off the nucleus at the same energy in order to demonstrate tunnelling .       provided that @xmath125 and normal coulomb wave functions should be accurate enough for the calculation of the ratio @xmath126 of wave functions at the origin .",
    "the wave function at the origin for a dirac particle is singular but the ratio is finite .",
    "the exact continuum wave functions for a dirac particle in a coulomb potential are discussed by rose@xcite .",
    "we shall just write down his results : if the particles are non - relativistic then    @xmath127    where p and @xmath1 are the particle momenta and energies and this is ofcourse exponentially small as @xmath128 .",
    "but if the particles are relativistic @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a ratio of complex gamma - functions and is approximately unity for large @xmath0 .",
    "so @xmath131 for @xmath132which is not specially small although it still decreases exponentially with @xmath133 it should be possible to measure @xmath134 by , for example , internal electron - positron pair production in positron - nucleus scattering versus pair production in electron - nucleus scattering .",
    "alternatively if the positrons were longitudinally polarised any resultant asymmetry in the scattering cross section would be due to weak processes .",
    "these could only occur at a distance @xmath135 which is effectively at the origin for atomic systems .",
    "so the asymmetry for polarised positron scattering could be compared with that for polarised electron scattering .",
    "the ratios of the asymmetries would give @xmath134 directly .",
    "but while experiments for @xmath136 should show tunnelling it will not yet amount to klein tunnelling .",
    "for that we require @xmath0 large enough so that bound positron states are present .",
    "this means that @xmath0 must be below its supercritical value @xmath137 of around @xmath138 but large enough for the @xmath139 state to have @xmath140 .",
    "the calculations of references @xcite and @xcite which depend on particular models of the nuclear charge distribution give this region as @xmath141 which unfortunately will be difficult to demonstrate experimentally",
    ". nevertheless , the theory seems to be clear : in this subcritical region positrons should no longer obey a tunnelling relation which decreases exponentially with z such as that of eq .",
    "( [ rel ] ) .",
    "instead the coulomb barrier should become more transparent as @xmath123 increases , at least for some energies .",
    "the work of jensen and his colleagues @xcite shows that a transmission resonance ( i.e. maximal transmission ) for positron scattering on a coulomb potential may well occur at @xmath142 although the onset of supercriticality implies that time independent scattering quantities will then no longer be well - defined .",
    "further detailed calculations are needed to clarify the situation for positron scattering off nuclei with @xmath0 just below @xmath137 .",
    "it is also important to see if the square well / barrier relationship we illustrate above that transmission resonances at barriers occur when the corresponding well becomes supercritical [ cf .",
    "eqs ( [ quant ] ) and ( [ even ] ] can be generalised to arbitrary potentials .",
    "we hope that this discussion has demonstrated that the klein step is pathological and therefore a misleading guide to the underlying physics .",
    "it represents a limit in which time - dependent emission processes become time - independent and therefore a relationship between the emitted current and the transmission coefficient exists , as we show in the appendix . in general no such relationship exists .",
    "the underlying physics discovered by klein in his solution of the dirac equation is not particle emission but tunnelling by means of the negative energy states which are characteristic of relativistic wave equations , similar to interband tunnelling in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "it is time to finally bring this 70 year old puzzle to a conclusion .",
    "we would like to thank a. anselm , g barton , j d bjorken , l b okun , r laughlin , g e volovik and d waxman for advice and help .",
    "consider the potential step @xmath143 for @xmath6 of section i. we will show that the expectation value of the current in the vacuum state in the presence of the step is non - zero . the derivation hinges on a careful definition of the vacuum state .",
    "scattering is usually described by a solution describing a wave incident ( say from the left ) plus a reflected wave ( from the right ) plus a transmitted wave ( to the right ) . it is convenient here to use waves of different form either describing a wave ( subscript @xmath145 incident from the left with no reflected wave or describing a wave ( subscript @xmath41 ) incident from the right with no reflected wave .",
    "positive and negative energy wavefunctions will be denoted by @xmath146 and @xmath147 respectively .",
    "it is clear that the nontrivial result we are seeking arises from the overlap of the negative energy continuum @xmath148 on the right with the positive energy continuum @xmath149 on the left .",
    "we are thus concerned with wavefunctions with energies in the range @xmath150 the expressions for @xmath151 in this energy range are given below .",
    "[ [ the - definition - of - the - vacuum - and - the - vacuum - expectation - value - of - the - current . ] ] the definition of the vacuum and the vacuum expectation value of the current . ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~      with @xmath162 given by the hermitean conjugate expansion.we must now determine the appropriate vacuum state in the presence of the step .",
    "states described by wavefunctions @xmath163 and @xmath164 correspond to ( positive energy ) electrons and positrons respectively coming from the left . hence with respect to an observer to the left ( of the step ) such states should be absent from the vacuum state , so          the wavefunctions that play the crucial role in the klein problem belong to the set @xmath166 for @xmath150 for an observer to the right these states are positive energy positrons and hence they should be filled in the vacuum state , i.e.        substituting ( [ exp ] ) in ( [ vev ] ) and noticing that all terms involving @xmath173 and @xmath174 can be dropped since the corresponding energies lie outside the interesting range @xmath175 we end up with @xmath176        @xmath177 if we use the anticommutation relations and ( [ a1 ] ) .",
    "the third term yields @xmath178 using ( [ vac ] ) and the fourth term vanishes using the anticommutation relations ( i.e. the exclusion principle ; the state @xmath179 already contains an electron in the state @xmath180 hence we get zero when we operate on it with @xmath181 ) .",
    "one energy integration is performed immediately using the @xmath182 function .",
    "the final result is      where the energy integration is over the klein range .",
    "this is the result first obtained by hansen and ravndal @xcite linking the pair production current with the transmission coefficient .",
    "but the fact that these quantities are linked does not represent a causal relationship between them .",
    "this is clear if we attempt to repeat this analysis for a square barrier for @xmath6 and @xmath27 .",
    "it is easily shown by the same method that      provided that averages over phase angles are understood , where now the current is measured by an observer situated at a point @xmath185 the result of eq .",
    "( [ cur ] ) of course can only be true in the approximation where the transient current is taken to be independent of time .",
    "note also that whereas for a klein step we describe the particle emission in terms of electron - positron pair production while we say that a supercritical well will spontaneously emit positrons .",
    "these terms are relative : an observer outside a supercritical well would see a positron current going to the right while an observer measuring the same phenomenon but inside the well would talk of an electron current going to the left .          a  a  grib , s  g  mamayev and v  m  mostepanenko ,  vacuum effects in strong fields  , friedmann , st petersburg , 1994 ; \" w greiner , b  muller and j  rafelski , ",
