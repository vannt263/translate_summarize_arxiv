    "super - massive black hole ( mbhs ) binaries are expected to form after major galaxy mergers .",
    "the main driving mechanism for the mbhs to sink to the centre is dynamical friction , where they will form a binary and start to shrink the semi - major axis on their way to the final merger .",
    "slingshot of stars from the surrounding stellar environment help the binary to further decay by exchanging energy and angular momentum , down to distances of about 1 pc @xcite .",
    "however , if the amount of stars to interact with is depleted , there is a risk of stalling , so that the mbhs would not coalesce within a hubble time .",
    "this is the so - called `` last - parsec problem '' ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a review on the whole process and references therein )",
    ".    key factors to surmount this last `` snag '' in the evolution are , among others , the fact that ( i ) in the case of binaries with a total mass of @xmath2 , slingshot ejections suffice to guarantee coalescence within a hubble time @xcite ; ( ii ) the role of gas may be crucial in the evolution of the binary , starting at larger scales .",
    "it might well be that in a merger of gas - rich galaxies , if mbhs are present , they will coalesce soon after the galaxies merge , in some @xmath3 myr , if the gas is distributed spherically . if , on the other hand , the gas is forming a nuclear disc , the galaxies need only to have @xmath4 of their total mass in gas for this to happen .",
    "@xcite found that such gas discs could indeed commonly help in the merger of smbhs with masses in the range of our study , whilst this mechanism fails for masses larger than @xmath5 ; ( iii ) following with stellar dynamics , resonant relaxation creates a steady state current of stars which can be as large as ten times the non - coherent two - body relaxation @xcite .",
    "this is a potential source of new stars populating the depleted loss - cone ; ( iv ) the work of @xcite shows that considering a non - spherically symmetric system the final parsec problem is largely solved ( v ) massive perturbers , such as giant molecular clouds or intermediate - mass black holes , can accelerate relaxation by orders of magnitude compared to two - body stellar relaxation , so that many new stars are supplied to interact with @xcite ; ( vi ) it has been observed that young , compact star clusters such as the arches and quintuplet systems reside near the galactic centre .",
    "if these star clusters have masses larger than @xmath6 , they can make their way down to the galactic centre even if they start from a distance as large as 60 pc within a few million years @xcite .",
    "the tidal stripping of these young stars could eventually provide the binary system with a new set of some @xmath7 stars ; ( vii ) if intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs ) , with masses ranging between @xmath8 exist in the centre of clusters , it has been predicted that within the innermost central 10 pc , we can expect to have some 50 imbhs of masses @xmath9 , and still some of them at scales of a few milliparsecs @xcite .",
    "the interaction of one of these imbhs with the binary of smbhs would obviously accelerate the process of shrinkage .",
    "the studies just cited provide a number of mechanisms to make the binary shrink .",
    "we expect then that a typical binary will be able to reach sub - pc separations , especially in the case of relatively low - mass mbhs in gas - rich environments . in this study , we concentrate on such a case ( see section  [ sec:2mbhdisc ] for details ) , which is expected when the parent galaxies are gas - rich and large amounts of gas fall to the centre of the new system , together with the mbhs . at that location ,",
    "the black holes get bound to each other , thus forming a binary , and are surrounded by a massive , parsec - scale gaseous disc ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such gaseous discs are similar to proto - stellar discs : due to their high density compared to the central object tidal force , the discs will be locally unstable to self - gravity , meaning that perturbations in their density field will grow .",
    "however , if the gas is unable to cool efficiently , then the gas will not be able to contract and form clumps , and the density perturbations will be sheared apart , creating a quasi - steady spiral pattern .",
    "remarkably , the spiral pattern transports the angular momentum outward , making the disc behave as an accretion disc . on the contrary , if the gas is able to cool quickly enough , then the density perturbations grow and form clumps , which shrink and further accrete gas , breaking up the gaseous disc completely and turning it into stars  the so - called _ fragmentation _ ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in either cooling regime , the situation where at the centre of the disc the central object is a binary will lead to a non - trivial interaction between them . on previous studies we have focused on the inefficient - cooling regime , showing that torques between the gas and the binary will shrink the orbit of the latter , while the angular momentum is driven out through the disc @xcite . in this paper",
    "we present the first numerical study of the fast cooling regime in which the disc fragments into stars , and follow the dynamical evolution of the binary  stars system .",
    "we carry out our study in two stages ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : first we model the fragmentation of the disc using smoothed particle hydrodynamics , and then we switch to our direct - summation @xmath0body models to both follow the long - term evolution of the system and to study the occurence of tdes .",
    "the reason for this two - step approach is that we first need to model the gas hydrodynamics in order to follow the fragmentation process of the gas , including the formation of stars and their growth via mergers and accretion of gas . in principle",
    ", one could wait for the gas to disperse or be accreted , and simply continue the same integration to follow the dynamical evolution of the stars for long time - scales .",
    "however , the sph code we are using is not designed to follow the collisional n - body dynamics of the system , therefore , it is necessary to use a different code that allow us to model the system of mbhs and stars in a meaningful way .",
    "following @xcite , we concentrate on a binary with the following initial parameters : total mass @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the masses of the individual mbhs , and mass ratio @xmath13 , in a circular ( newtonian ) orbit of separation @xmath14 . the binary is surrounded by a corotating gaseous disc with an initial mass @xmath15 and radial range @xmath16@xmath17 .",
    "the gas is modelled as an ideal gas with @xmath18 , and radiative cooling is mimicked with a cooling time defined as @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a free parameter that fixes the cooling rate , @xmath21 is the orbital frequency around the binary , and @xmath22 is the distance from the binary centre of mass . since we are interested in the fragmentation regime , in this paper we consider fast cooling rates , @xmath23 .",
    "the choice of a disc that fragments is realistic for self - gravitating discs that cool thermally , above a certain surface density threshold .",
    "@xcite showed that , for the masses and distances we are interested in here , that threshold lies in the 10100 g/@xmath24 range .",
    "this model for the system dynamics is scale - free , meaning that it can be scaled up or down to different masses and lenghts .",
    "however , in order to introduce star formation and also to estimate the rate of tidal disruption events ( tdes ) , we need to choose physical units . with that aim",
    "we set the total mass of the binary as @xmath25 and we choose @xmath26pc .",
    "this would be a typical mass for binary black holes in the range that could be detected by a lisa - like experiment @xcite .",
    "the chosen separation corresponds roughly to the value where we would expect binaries to spend the longest of their evolution in a simple model that considers binary shrinking due to stellar scattering from a spherical cusp @xcite and torques from a non - fragmenting disc ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* their eq .",
    "12).pc is below the classical @xmath27 pc separation of the `` final parsec problem '' , but for the range of masses considered in this work we deem it not a problem , as we summarized in the introduction . ]    while several studies @xcite have shown that stellar dynamical processes pump up the eccentricity of a binary mbh , in this case we are assuming the binary has reached the inner parsec in a gas - rich environment . in such a case , the dynamical friction of the gas on the mbhs drives them to form a circular binary ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus we choose a circular orbit for the initial configuration .",
    "to follow the process of circumbinary disc fragmentation , we use a modified version of the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code ( gadget , @xcite ) , combining the numerical methods of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "here we only briefly describe the methods , and refer the interested reader to those papers for more details .",
    "we model the gaseous disc as an ensemble of initially @xmath28 particles of @xmath29 each .",
    "the code calculates the gravitational and hydrodynamical interaction between gas particles , plus the gravitational interaction between all particles , including the mbhs as well as the `` proto - stars '' and `` stars '' that form during the simulation ( see below ) .",
    "we use a softening of @xmath30 for the gas particles and of @xmath31 for the proto - stars .",
    "the mbhs do not use softening , but a sink radius within which gas particles are accreted .",
    "this radius had a value of @xmath32 .",
    "as initial conditions , we take the initially - circular system modelled by @xcite , at a time @xmath33 . in this way",
    "we skip the transient initial evolution caused by the homogeneous initial conditions described in their work , and start from a steady - state configuration in which the circumbinary disc has developed spiral arms .",
    "notice , however , that their simulations used @xmath34 , avoiding fragmentation . in our new simulations we set the value of @xmath20 to either 1 , 2 , 3 , or 5 . as a result , the disc now forms clumps , which grow in a runaway fashion .",
    "treating this this with a pure sph model is not feasible , as the growing densities require ever shorter time - steps . to circumvent this problem , we introduce sink particles to model the proto - stars that we expect would form in these large density regions .    _ proto - star particles _ are created when the gas density reaches 30 times the roche tidal limit , @xmath35",
    "how many stars will form out of a gas density peak is a very complex question , whose solution is well outside the possibilities of our study . in our model",
    "we deal with this issue in an individual particle basis , i.e. , each gas particle is turned into one proto - star particle of the same mass .",
    "however , the newly formed proto - star particles can merge with each other , thus forming higher mass stars .",
    "the merger criterion is simply that their distance is smaller than @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the size of the proto - stars , which we typically take as @xmath38 cm , and @xmath39 is a free parameter with fiducial value of unity that mimics the effect of gravitational focusing .",
    "the size parameter corresponds to @xmath40 ( where @xmath41 is the disc scale - height ) , which is roughly the thickness of the gas arms we observe in the simulations .",
    "thus , in a two - step process we are in principle allowing all the dense gas within the same overdensity to form one proto - star .",
    "however , we only allow the proto - stars to merge with each other as long as their masses do not exceed @xmath42 .",
    "once they reach this mass we turn the proto - star particle into an actual _",
    "star particle_. the motivation for this threshold is twofold : numerically , we form an actual star out of @xmath43 gas particles ; physically , we avoid the rapid formation of extremely massive stars .",
    "stars can merge with proto - stars , but not among each other .",
    "stars and proto - stars also grow by accreting their surrounding gas .",
    "we use an eddington - limited bondi ",
    "hoyle prescription to calculate their accretion rate , and then pick up at random enough particles from the ( proto-)star neighbours that are merged with the sink particle @xcite . to calculate the bondi ",
    "hoyle and eddington accretion rates , we use the mass of the ( proto ) star , and a radius that is either the main sequence value corresponding to that mass ( eq .  11 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) for the star particles , or the fixed value @xmath37 for the proto - stars .",
    "this difference results in a much faster growth for proto - stars than for stars .",
    "the black holes also accrete the few gas particles that get too close to them .",
    "this procedure is done mostly to avoid the short time - steps that would be required to follow those gas particle orbits .",
    "accretion on to the black holes is modelled simply with a sink radius  all gas particles entering the region around @xmath32 of either black hole are taken away from the simulation , with their mass and momentum being added to the corresponding mbh @xcite .",
    "we have ran 6 different sph simulations .",
    "four of them use the fiducial values mentioned above , but differ on the strength of the cooling .",
    "we refer to these runs as beta1 , beta2 , beta3a and beta5 .",
    "additionally , since we tend to form many very massive stars , we explore the effect of decreasing the numerical size of the proto - stars , hindering their growth .",
    "for @xmath44 then we run two additional simulations , beta3b and beta3c , in both of which we use a smaller size for the protostars of @xmath45 instead of the fiducial value of @xmath46 . run beta3c has however a larger gravitational focusing factor of @xmath47 instead of the fiducial @xmath48 . for both extra simulations then there is a more severe ( eddington ) limit on the accretion rate for the proto - stars than in the fiducial beta3a , while simulation beta3b has additionally a smaller likelihood of proto - stellar mergers .",
    "these choices in the conditions for gas cooling and for transforming gas particles into `` stars '' arguably capture a sufficiently broad number of potential fragmentation scenarios so as to envisage our analysis representative of a self - gravitating disc , within the limitations of the rather expensive numerical experiments .",
    "we run the sph simulations of circumbinary discs for several hundred binary dynamical times . due to the gas self - gravity , clumps grow in the disc . given the short cooling times , these clumps contract , achieving the disc fragmentation . in most simulations , after only @xmath49 , the vast majority ( @xmath50% ) of the gas is turned into stars , as expected .",
    "the system then reaches a quasi - steady state in which stars very slowly accrete the tenous left - over gas ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the gas morphology at that stage for the different simulations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig.gasdens_all ] .",
    "the fragmentation rate is set by the cooling time of the disc , thus discs with lower values of @xmath20 will evolve faster .",
    "we can see this in figure [ fig.stellar_mass ] , which shows the mass in stars as a function of time for all the simulations .",
    "the fourth column in table  [ tab.nbody ] shows the number of stars formed in each simulation . considering only the variation of @xmath20 ,",
    "it is clear that shorter cooling times result in larger amounts of stars , as expected @xcite .",
    "as the total stellar mass is approximately constant , the typical stellar masses will be lower for shorter cooling times .",
    "it is interesting to note that the star formation process is not uniform .",
    "instead , it happens preferentially in a few localised , relatively large regions , whose sizes are set by the spiral - arm overdensities .",
    "even though we allow proto - stars to merge when they form close together , our numerical recipe avoids the formation of very large stars , which forces the formation of `` stellar clusters '' ( see the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig.3b_mosaic ] ) . some of these clusters feel a strong torque from the spiral arm and are driven towards the centre of the system , where the tidal force of the binary disperses them .",
    "this stellar distribution affects the long - term dynamics of the system and has interesting consequences for the production of tidal disruption events (  [ sec.clusterinfall ] ) .    in our tests with @xmath44 and different stellar growth recipes",
    "we first notice that runs beta3a and beta3c are practically identical , and that run beta3b has the same curve of stellar mass growth . from this",
    "we conclude that in our simulations accretion is not important and that stellar growth is driven by mergers of sink particles . , which corresponds to about hundred years for the density values required for the introduction of sink particles .",
    "on the other hand , the bondi accretion rate for a solar mass sink , even for those very high densities , is only @xmath51 in our models , so the time required to accrete _ a single _ sph particle turns out to be @xmath52yr . ]",
    "we also notice that the number of stars formed is about an order of magnitude higher in beta3b , which has 10 times smaller proto - stars than the fiducial run , and that the effect of having smaller proto - stars in the simulation is similar to having a shorter cooling time .    to continue our study of the evolution of the mbhs and circumbinary disc system",
    ", we will take the masses , positions , and velocities of all sink particles and use them as input in direct - summation @xmath0body simulations . for simplicity ,",
    "we take the snapshot at time @xmath53 for all configurations , except for beta5 .",
    "since in that run the evolution is slower , we use the snapshot at @xmath54 , by which time 90% of the gas has turned into stars .",
    "to analyse the dynamical evolution of the mbh binary embedded in the stellar system product of the stellar formation we use a direct - summation code , nbody6 .",
    "this is a very expensive method because we integrate all gravitational forces for all formed stars at every time step , without making any a priori assumptions about the system .",
    "this code belongs to the family of dynamical codes for particle systems with relaxation processes of sverre aarseth .",
    "the code uses the improved hermite integration scheme as described in  @xcite .",
    "since these approaches integrate newton s equations directly , all newtonian gravitational effects are included naturally .",
    "more crucial for this subject is that it also incorporates both the _ ks regularisation _ and the _ chain regularisation _ , so that when stars are tightly bound or their separation becomes too small during a hyperbolic encounter , the system is regularised @xcite .",
    "the advantages of this code as compared to the leap frog integrator of gadget for our particular problem are obvious , namely the high accuracy in the energy conservation , since we are interested in the correct evolution of the inner binary of mbhs as well as in potential tdes . for this aim , as we describe later , we modified the standard version of nbody6",
    ".    for each simulation , the initial masses , coordinates and velocities for the stars and mbhs are taken from the gadget data at the times shown in table  [ tab.nbody ] . at that moment , the gas mass  stellar mass ratio is very low ( see table [ tab.nbody ] , column @xmath55 ) .",
    "the gravitational effect of gas is almost negligible and we do not include it in the simulations . despite our limit to the growth of `` proto - star particles '' in the sph simulations ( see section  [ sec.fragm ] ) , some `` star particles '' did manage to achieve very large masses .",
    "we deem those unphysical , so in the initial conditions for our @xmath0body runs we replace stars with masses @xmath56 above @xmath57 with a cluster following a plummer distribution @xcite consisting of equal mass stars with total mass @xmath56 and radius    @xmath58    with @xmath22 the distance to the centre - of - mass of the binary .",
    "the last equation corresponds to the roche lobe of the massive star with respect to the mbh binary with mass @xmath59 .    in our @xmath0body simulations ,",
    "table [ tab.nbody ] , we exclude stars which are at a distance @xmath60 , where @xmath14 is the semi - major axis of the mbh binary .",
    "we assume those stars would have only a negligible effect on the binary evolution .",
    "they correspond to about a quarter of all stars in each simulation .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig.profile_evolution ] , this cut in the cluster did not affect its global structure , its density profile remains roughly constant at large radii .",
    "the figure also shows that the region inside a few times the binary semi - major axis gets depleted quickly by sling - shot interactions , as expected .    .",
    "initial data for the nbody6 runs .",
    "notice that we do not integrate run beta3c using the @xmath0body technique , because it turned out to be identical to beta3a .",
    "sph time is the moment at which we stop the gadget simulation , in units of @xmath61 , @xmath62 is the ratio between gas and stellar mass at that moment , @xmath63 is the number of stars that have been formed at that moment in the gadget simulation , @xmath64 is the number of stars within a distance @xmath65 from the centre of mass of the binary and @xmath66 is the number that we get after splitting all very massive stars into sub - clusters , as explained in section [ sec.shrinking ] .",
    "the reason why the last model has more stars than beta3b at @xmath67 is because it corresponds to a previous moment in the evolution and , as we explained above , protostars are allowed to merge with each other .",
    "this last case is a special one , and we ran a dedicated simulation for it .",
    "see section [ sec.clusterinfall ] . also , we note that while the gas was originally distributed in a rather narrow radial range ( @xmath68 ) , we end up with stars even at distances @xmath69 .",
    "this is due to @xmath0body scattering , as many star particles are formed in relatively crowded regions of the disc .",
    "[ tab.nbody ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "in this work we have presented the first realisations of fragmenting discs around a binary of two mbhs in sph with star formation followed by direct - summation @xmath0body simulations of the resulting systems .",
    "we have evaluated different fragmentation scenarios based on an approximation for the cooling rate of the gaseous discs and different prescriptions for the growth of protostars .",
    "when the gas is almost completely depleted , we take the masses , positions and velocities of the newly formed stars and feed them to the direct - summation @xmath0body integrations with the proviso that if the protostar has a mass above @xmath57 , we convert it into an agglomeration of stars following a plummer profile of radius the roche radius of the protostar to avoid artificially - created very massive stars .",
    "we simulate with a dedicated direct - summation integration the particular case of a simulation in which a cluster of stars that forms during the sph simulation falls on to the binary , the case beta3b95 . for this , we modify nbody6 to include `` gas cloud '' particles that allow the infalling cluster to hold together in the dynamical simulation in which we can not realistically simulate the gas .",
    "infalling clusters such as this and the scattering of isolated stars lead to a significant number of tdes . to make an accurate estimation",
    ", we made a second modification of nbody6 to implement stellar tidal disruptions , and we find that the event rates lie between @xmath71 per system per year , which lies on the high side of current ( uncertain ) estimates for the tde rate in standard galaxies , which typically lie between @xmath72 @xcite , and lie well within the observed rates @xcite .",
    "a particular interesting signature of these tdes is the `` reverberation mapping '' response of the circumbinary disc to a burst of emission produced by the tdes .",
    "the light from the burst excites the gas in the disc , producing emission lines .",
    "the time - variability of the spectra , the _ echo _ of the tde , during the months after the burst could in principle allow us to constrain the disc structure ( brem , amaro - seoane , cuadra & komossa ; part ii of this paper to be submitted ) .    while our simulations can not follow the evolution of the binary for much longer times , it is interesting to ask the question whether the semi - major axis of the binary reaches distances that would lead it to coalesce within a hubble time because of the emission of gravitational radiation , measurable in a lisa - like detector such as elisa @xcite . for this",
    ", the binary has to shrink from an initial semi - major of @xmath73 down to @xmath74 .",
    "this corresponds to an increase of orbital binding energy of about one order of magnitude .",
    "the net change in binding energy after an interaction with one bound star of mass @xmath75 can be estimated as @xmath76 .",
    "we start the direct - summation simulations with a ratio of stellar mass to mbh binary mass of @xmath77 , so that ab definitio the stellar mass that is formed is not enough for the binary to shrink down to the phase in which the evolution is dominated by gravitational radiation . indeed ,",
    "if we consider all stars in the disc to be ejected , we estimate in the limit of this low mass ratio that the total effect of the stellar disc is of about @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the mass ratio of stellar mass to bh mass . following an argument similar to e.g.",
    "@xcite , if we compare this to the orbital energy at semi - major axis @xmath14 , one finds that the relative change after ejecting all the stars is @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the symmetric mass ratio , well below what would be necessary to shrink the binary by one order of magnitude .",
    "we note that indeed ejecting half of the stellar mass only shrinks the binary semi - major axis by @xmath82 , as we see in the first 3 myr of our @xmath0body simulations , in figure [ fig.semimajor_numberstars ] .",
    "while this is true for our specific scenario , we note that further episodes of gas inflow towards the centre could potentially trigger more episodes of star formation in the disc , which would lead to star scattering and a further skrinkage .",
    "moreover , while we have focused on the effect of stars formed in - situ on the binary , but the system will be surrounded by a stellar cusp that constitutes an additional source of shrinkage for the binary .",
    "the supply of stars that will interact with it can be enhanced by additional mechanisms in a more realistic picture than that of an isolated , spherically symmetric galactic nucleus , as we discussed in the introduction .",
