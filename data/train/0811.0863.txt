    "this talk is the brief description of our attempt to find a self - consistent theoretical approach to soft ( long distance ) interaction at high energy ( see our paper of ref.@xcite for full presentation ) .",
    "our main idea is that there is no other dimemsionful scales except the saturation scale for high energy interaction in the entire kinematic region .",
    "this idea looks strange since the traditional approach to soft high energy interaction is based on the phenomenological soft pomeron , whose typical dimensionful scale is given by the slope of the pomeron trajectory ( @xmath0 ) . in simple words , we would like to replace the soft pomeron exchange in the scattering amplitude by the qcd scattering amplitude in the saturation region .",
    "@xmath1 for this amplitude and the saturation momentum ( @xmath2 ) is the only dimensionful scale for it .",
    "since this amplitude governs both short distances and long distances processes , all needed parameters in a such amplitude can be found from the dis on the contrary to soft phenomenology in which all parameters are extracted from the soft scattering . the idea is not new and it is scattered in a number of reviews and talks ( see references in ref.@xcite ) . however",
    "the first practical realization was suggested in ref.@xcite with an encouraging result : it is possible to describe the data on total cross section in the framework of such ideas . in this talk as well as in our paper",
    "@xcite we wish to check these ideas against the full set of experimental data in the region of accessible energies and even give some predictions for the lhc energy range .",
    "our approach is based on two theoretical inputs .",
    "* factorization of short and long distances : * using the dispersion relation we can prove ( see ref.@xcite that at least at large impact parameters the scattering amplitude for the bfkl pomeron can be written in the form @xmath3 * the scattering amplitude of dipole ( x , y ) near to the saturation boundary * has the form@xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the scattering amplitude of dipole @xmath6 with the target at low energy and @xmath7 is the green s function of the bfkl pomeron .",
    "using these two theory inputs we built our model assuming    * @xmath8 ; * @xmath9- the electromagnetic proton form factor ; * instead of the bfkl pomeron in eq.[af ] we use the solution to the dglap equation ; * the scale of hardness in the dglap evolution ia chosen in the form : @xmath10 .",
    "finally , @xmath11 all parameters in eq.[mo ] we found from fitting the dis data with @xmath12/d.o.f .",
    "the formulae for calculation of the physical observables are simple and can be found in ref . @xcite and",
    "the structure of them is seen from the expression for the total cross section for meson proton scattering : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the wave function of a meson which consists of one colourless dipole with size @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is dipole scattering amplitude .",
    "therefore , we need to specify the wave hadronic wave function in terms of t dipoles . as have been mentioned , we assume that mesons consist of one dipole , for baryon we have two possibilities for the dipole content : two dipoles or three dipoles .",
    "we used both in our comparison with the experiment . for one dipole in the hadron we used the simplest gaussian parameterization , namely @xmath17 where @xmath18 was chosen from comparison with the experiment .",
    "this is the only parameter that we found from the data on soft scattering .",
    "the second input that we need to calculate the scattering amplitude is to define the energy variable @xmath19 ( or @xmath20 ) .",
    "we did this in the following way , using our the only dimensionful scale ( saturation momentum @xmath2 ) : @xmath21",
    "using the model we obtain the description of the experimental data which is not too bad .",
    "we consider that it is much better than we could hope with such a simple model .    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "in the table we show our prediction for the lhc range of energy with comparison with other models .",
    "the most pronounced difference between our estimates and rmk model@xcite in the value of the survival probability for the central higgs production .",
    "it is worth mentioning , that in our approach the small value of @xmath22 stems from good - walker mechanism but not from the enhanced diagrams as in glmm model @xcite",
    ".    we will be happy if you , thinking about pomeron , would remember that ( i ) there is a possibility to describe the data without introducing soft pomeron ; ( ii ) the idea about the saturation momentum as the only dimensional parameter of the strong interaction works ; and ( iii ) all parameters for strong interaction can be found from dis .",
    "we are grateful to errol gotsman , uri maor and alex palatnik for useful discussions on the subject .",
