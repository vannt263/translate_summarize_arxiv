    "formula ( [ n55 ] ) is  valid under condition ( [ pf ] ) when the axial charge density exceeds @xmath96 of course , it does not imply that the number of tachyons must also exceed some finite bottom level . for thermodynamical relations ( [ z1 ] ) , ( [ p0])-([n5 ] ) does not provide us any information about quantity @xmath97 and it is not clear whether it is finite of has any physical meaning because the number of tachyons ( [ n ] ) is not conserved .",

    "particle number density  .",
    "it is finite in spite of the fact that each contribution of tachyons ( [ n+ ] ) and antitachyons ( [ n- ] ) are separately divergent .",
    "we deliberately leave helicity @xmath117 in ( [ n2 ] ) because it implies correct definition of @xmath118 . the total electric charge @xmath119 depends on the handedness and the sign of tachyonic charge :",
    "for example , if left - handed tachyon ( @xmath120 ) has electric charge @xmath33 equal to 1 electron charge , then , the total electric charge of a many - tachyon system @xmath121 has always opposite sign to the charge of electron .",
    "this can be compared with a hot nuclear matter where the number of protons always exceeds the number of antiprotons so that the total electric charge of nucleon is always positive ( and counterbalanced by the negative charge of electron gas ) .",
    "quantity @xmath122 is always positive and it can be called as effective particle number density , bearing in mind how it is incorporated in ( [ q2])-([n2 ] ) . at zero temperature ( [ hea ] ) it is reduced to @xmath123 and the total electric charge ( [ q2 ] ) is easily expressed @xmath124 \\ ,   \\label{q22}\\ ] ] in terms of the axial density @xmath6 ( [ n55 ] ) .",
    "the total scalar density @xmath125 is also finite while each contribution of particles ( [ s+ ] ) and antiparticles ( [ s- ] ) are divergent",
    ". the scalar density ( [ ns ] ) at zero temperature is determined by formula @xmath126 that coincides with expression derived in the earlier work @xcite in by means of intuitive analysis but without strict proof .",
    "note that the scalar density of an ordinary fermionic matter @xmath127 differs from ( [ ns22 ] ) by the sign before @xmath128 .",
    "the knowledge of ( [ n5 ] ) , ( [ n2 ] ) and ( [ ns ] ) is necessary for calculation the of thermodynamical functions of interacting tachyon fermi gas . comparing formulas ( [ n55 ] ) , ( [ n22 ] ) and ( [ ns22 ] ) , one notes that @xmath129 at any @xmath130 , and @xmath131 when @xmath132 , while @xmath133 when @xmath134 , see fig .",
    "maximum ratio @xmath135 is achieved at @xmath136 . at large @xmath137 and",
    "@xmath138 the tachyon matter behaves as an ordinary massless fermi gas , and @xmath139 .",
    "the limit of low density @xmath140 corresponds to @xmath141 and @xmath142 while the minimum axial density ( [ nt ] ) is achieved at the vanishing particle number density @xmath143 .",
    "however , this limit is not achieved in practice because a tachyon fermi gas is unstable with respect to hydrodynamical perturbations at such small density since their causal propagation takes place only at @xcite @xmath144 that , in the light of ( [ n22 ] ) , corresponds to @xmath145 the tachyon medium can exist only at finite material density @xmath146 while a rarefied tachyon fermi gas will be unstable , perhaps , decaying into an aggregate of dense droplets .    of course , we could avoid divergences in ( [ n+])-([s- ] ) , considering the only sector @xmath147 and excluding the low - momentum states @xmath148 as unphysical ones",
    ". however , in spite of attractiveness of this approach , it results in serious contradictions so that statistical description of a many - tachyon system becomes senseless @xcite .",
    "a many - tachyon system is looking strange and contrasting to an ordinary system of particles and antiparticles .",
    "the main invariant is the axial charge ( [ q5 ] ) while the number of tachyons ( [ n ] ) is not conserved ( like the number of photons in black body radiation , or the number of thermal excitation in solids ) .",
    "the axial charge density @xmath6 determined by formula ( [ n5 ] ) is incorporated in the thermodynamical equations ( [ z2])-([n5 ] ) of a tachyon fermi gas instead of the particle number density @xmath149 ( [ nn0 ] ) .",
    "the charge conjugation ( [ d2j ] ) changes the signs of electric charge while the axial charge remains the same implying that the tachyons and antitachyons have equal chemical potential @xmath150 ( [ mu ] ) .",
    "this fact is crucial in the thermodynamics of tachyon fermi gas because negative @xmath151 would not allow us to operate with unambiguous distribution function ( [ f ] ) at small momentum @xmath148 , implying impossibility of regularization of the total electric charge ( [ q2 ] ) .",
    "the number of tachyons @xmath152 and antitachyons @xmath153 as well as their summary number @xmath154 can not be defined or presented as a function on temperature .",
    "nevertheless , the difference between the particles and antiparticles @xmath155 is reflected in the total electric charge ( [ ee2 ] ) and we managed to estimate it in terms of the thermodynamical functions of tachyon gas ( [ q2 ] ) . the scalar density is also estimated ( [ ns ] ) and at zero temperature it coincides with expression found in the previous analysis @xcite . at zero temperature the axial density , particle number density , total electric charge and scalar density are given by formulas ( [ n55 ] ) , ( [ n22 ] ) , ( [ q22 ] ) and ( [ ns22 ] ) , respectively , see fig .",
    "[ ns5 ] .    as for the alternative dirac equation with imaginary mass @xmath156 it yields the same tachyonic dispersion relation ( [ tah ] ) . however , it is not associated with any conserved current because @xcite @xmath157 and @xmath158",
    ". the relevant partition function will be equivalent to ( [ z1 ] ) at zero chemical potential , i.e. when tachyonic thermal excitations are considered .",
    "when a may - tachyon system is put in external filed , the single - particle energy spectrum of particles @xmath159 and antiparticles @xmath160 will be different .",
    "the thermodynamical functions of the whole system will be calculated by formulas ( [ p0-])-([n5- ] ) and the distribution functions of the tachyons @xmath161 and antitachyons @xmath162 may not coincide . then , the total electric charge ( [ n2 ] ) should be carefully estimated because the divergent terms in ( [ n2 ] ) and ( [ n2 ] ) may occur finite and will not be mutually eliminated if @xmath163 in the presence of external field that may imply request for production of other sorts of charged particles .",
    "of course , for an electrically neutral system ( for example , a mixture of positive - charged tachyons and electrons ) , this effect may play visible role only beyond the classical or mean - field level when the quantum exchange and correlation corrections to interaction are taken into account .",
