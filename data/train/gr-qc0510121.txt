    "the inspiral of compact objects such as neutron stars and black holes are expected to be a major source of gravitational waves ( gw ) for the ground - based detectors ligo , virgo , geo600 and tama  @xcite , as well as for the future planned space - based detector lisa  @xcite . due to the effect of radiation reaction",
    ", the orbit of the binary system slowly decays over time . as this happens the amplitude and frequency of the waveform increases emitting a ` chirp ' waveform .",
    "the most prominently used method for detecting these waveforms is matched filtering  @xcite . in this method one",
    "creates a series of theoretical waveforms or templates which depend on the parameters of the system .",
    "these templates are then cross correlated with the detector output , weighted with the inverse of the power spectral density .",
    "we demand that the templates achieve a predetermined threshold in the root - mean - square correlation before having any confidence in the detection of a gw and the parameters it estimates .",
    "one of the main problems with matched filtering is that it is highly sensitive to the phase of the waveform .",
    "a template that goes out of phase with a possible signal , even for a small number of cycles , leads to a severe degradation in the recovered signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) .",
    "it is therefore imperative that we know the phase of the wave to very good accuracy .",
    "there have been many efforts to create templates which will approximate a possible signal to high accuracy .",
    "on one hand we have the post - newtonian ( pn ) expansion of einstein s equations to treat the dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "this works well in the adiabatic or slow - motion approximation for all mass ranges . on the other hand",
    "we have black hole perturbation theory  @xcite which works for any velocity , but only in situations where the mass of one body is much greater than the other .",
    "while templates have been generated to 5.5 pn order for a test - mass orbiting a schwarzschild black hole  @xcite , and to 3.5 pn order for non - spinning binaries of comparable mass  @xcite , a number of difficulties still need to be tackled .",
    "the main problem is that both templates are a function of the orbital energy and gw flux functions . in the test - mass case , an exact expression in known for the orbital energy , but we have a pn expansion for the flux function . in the comparable - mass case , a pn expansion is known for both functions .",
    "it has been shown that the convergence of both methods is too slow to be useful in creating templates that can be confidently used in a gw search  @xcite .",
    "we also know that the pn approximation begins to break down when the orbital separation of the two bodies is @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "this means that as we approach the last stable orbit ( lso ) the templates begin to go out of phase with a possible signal due to the increase of relativistic effects .",
    "it is because of this that we need to have the most accurate templates that we can possibly have , without being computationally expensive .    as well as the pn templates ,",
    "there are many other templates on the market at present , all of whom have certain advantages ( and disadvantages ) over others .",
    "it was shown  @xcite that templates based on resummation methods such as pad approximation have a faster convergence in modelling the gravitational waveform .",
    "this gave a superior template in the test - mass and comparable - mass case ( if the comparable - mass case can be treated as a smooth deformation of the test - mass case .",
    "see , for example , blanchet  @xcite for arguments against ) .",
    "the pad based templates were then used to partially construct effective one body templates  @xcite which went beyond the adiabatic approximation and modelled the waveform into the merger phase .",
    "other more phenomenological templates such as the bcv  @xcite templates seem to be excellent at detecting gw , but are not necessarily the best template to use in the extraction of parameters . in any ideal detection strategy",
    "we would like to have a single template which could provide a confident detection , while extracting the parameters of the system to very high accuracy .",
    "the question is can we improve on the construction of the templates .",
    "the answer , theoretically , is yes .",
    "the problem with expansions like a taylor series is that they are based on weierstrass s theorem .",
    "this states : _ for any continuous function @xmath4 $ ] and for any given @xmath5 , there exists a polynomial @xmath6 for some sufficiently large @xmath7 such that @xmath8_. so as long as we expand a series to a sufficiently large number of terms , we can always approximate a function very well .",
    "however , this is not always possible as the number of necessary terms may be too high ( for example , it takes about 5000 terms in an expansion of @xmath9 to deliver five significant figures at @xmath10 equal to unity  @xcite ) , or we may be dealing with an approximation to some function where it is very difficult to calculate more than a few terms ( e.g. the pn expansion of the flux function ) . we know that the flux function has been approximated by an expansion to 11 terms for a test - mass body , and 7 for a comparable mass body .",
    "we also know from previous studies that this may not be sufficient . a more promising possibility is based on the chebyshev alternation theorem for polynomials which states ` _ for any continuous function @xmath4 $ ] , a unique minimax polynomial approximation @xmath6 exists , and is uniquely characterised by the ` alternation property ' ( or ` equioscillation property ' ) that there are ( at least ) @xmath11 points in @xmath12 $ ] at which @xmath13 attains its maximum absolute value with alternating signs _ ' .",
    "thus , the reason the minimax polynomial is so sought after is that the chebyshev alternation theorem guarantees that there is only one such polynomial and it has the necessary condition of having an ` equal - ripple ' error curve .",
    "unfortunately , the minimax polynomial is extremely difficult , if not impossible , to find .",
    "however , all is not lost .",
    "the family of ultraspherical ( or gegenbauer ) polynomials are defined by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a constant .",
    "these polynomials are orthogonal over @xmath16 $ ] with respect to the weight function @xmath17 .",
    "a feature of the polynomials @xmath18 is that they have @xmath7 distinct and real zeros and exhibit an oscillatory behaviour in the interval @xmath19 $ ] . for values of @xmath20 ,",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations increase as we move from the origin to the endpoints . for @xmath21 ,",
    "the oscillations decrease as we move to the endpoints .",
    "however , for @xmath22 the amplitude of the oscillations remain constant throughout the interval .",
    "this value of @xmath23 corresponds to the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind , @xmath24 , ( hereafter chebyshev polynomials ) with @xmath25 .",
    "these polynomials are closely related to the minimax polynomial due to the fact that there are @xmath26 points in [ -1,1 ] where @xmath24 attains a maximum absolute value with alternating signs , i.e. @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this is their main strength over the taylor or pad type expansions as neither obey the alternation theorem and are thus nowhere close to the minimax polynomial .",
    "in fact it can be shown  @xcite that the chebyshev polynomials exhibit the fastest convergence properties of all of the ultraspherical polynomials .",
    "the @xmath26 extrema are given by @xmath28 with @xmath7 zeros given by @xmath29\\pi}{n}\\right)\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,k=1, .. ,n .\\ ] ] the chebyshev polynomials are formally defined by @xmath30 from de moivre s theorem , we know that @xmath31 is a polynomial of degree @xmath7 in @xmath32 , e.g. @xmath33 which allows us to write the chebyshev polynomials @xmath34 therefore , a chebyshev series in @xmath10 corresponds to a fourier series in @xmath35 .",
    "this close relation to a trigonometric function means these polynomials are extremely useful in approximating functions .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials are orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight @xmath36 according to @xmath37 with initial conditions @xmath38 we calculate the higher order chebyshev polynomials using the recurrance relation @xmath39 to calculate the higher order polynomials , given the initial conditions .    for our purposes",
    ", we need to approximate polynomials which are a function of the dimensionless velocity @xmath40 in the domain @xmath41 $ ] , where @xmath42 is the velocity at the lso for a test - particle orbiting a schwarzschild black hole . in this case",
    "we use the shifted chebyshev polynomials , designated @xmath43 .",

    "we define the restricted pn waveform .",
    "while not being completely correct , this waveform suffices to allow us to test the modelling of the gravitational wave flux function . in this section",
    "we define the flux function and the orbital energy function for a test particle in an equatorial circular orbit around a schwarzschild black hole . in section  [ sec : chebapprox ] we outline the steps involved in defining the chebyshev approximation to the gravitational flux function to 5.5 pn order .",
    "we also show in this section how the monomials in the velocity @xmath40 can be written in terms of chebyshev polynomials . in section  [ sec : model ]",
    "we first of all define chebyshev economization and examine the truncation errors involved in both the pn and chebyshev approximations to the flux .",
    "we then look at the graphical modelling of the flux function and analyse how the new approximation competes with both the pn and pad approximations when compared to a numerical flux .",
    "in particular we look at how the new approximation improves the fit to the numerical flux at the lso . in section  [ sec : results ]",
    "we look at fitting factors and parameter estimation for a choice of three test - mass systems . in this section",
    "we again compare the performance of the chebyshev , pn and pad templates when compared to an ` exact ' signal constructed using the exact orbital energy and a numerically calculated flux .    throughout the paper we use @xmath51 .",
    "in the tt gauge , the response of a detector to an impending gravitational wave is given by @xmath52 , where @xmath53 are the polarizations of the wave and @xmath54 are the beam pattern functions of the detector .",
    "for ground based detectors , the duration of the wave is so short ( less than a minute in most cases ) , we can take the beam pattern functions to be constant . in this case",
    "we can write the restricted pn waveform as  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the total mass of the system , @xmath57 is the reduced mass ratio , @xmath58 is the distance to the source , @xmath59 is a constant , @xmath60 is the orbital velocity of the bodies , @xmath61 is the phase of the wave and @xmath62 can be taken as being the phase at the time of arrival of the wave in the detector . in the stationary phase approximation",

    "we will use one of the projected third - generation detectors , euro  @xcite .",
    "the reason we use this particular curve is due to the fact that this detector has a predicted lower frequency cutoff of about @xmath70 allowing us to investigate larger mass systems that would have already begun coalescence in the bandwith of the first generation detectors .",
    "we have plotted the effective noise @xmath71 for the main first and third generation detectors in figure  ( [ fig : psd ] ) .",
    "solving the above equation for @xmath66 gives @xmath72^{-1/2}\\ ] ] the phase of the fourier transform in the stationary phase approximation , @xmath73 , is given by @xmath74 where @xmath75 can be taken as being the time of arrival and the phase of the wave at time of arrival of the gravitational wave , @xmath76 is the instantaneous velocity , @xmath77 is the derivative of the orbital energy with respect to the velocity @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the angular velocity as observed at infinity and @xmath10 is an invariant velocity parameter observed at infinity .",
    "finally , @xmath80 is the gravitational wave flux function . instead of solving the integrals in the above equation it is numerically more efficient to solve the following equivalent differential equations for the phasing formula in the fourier domain : @xmath81    for a test - mass particle in circular orbit about a schwarzschild black hole , an exact expression for the orbital energy exists  @xcite .",
    "for our purposes we need it s derivative with respect to the velocity , i.e. @xmath82 where we have introduced a finite - mass dependence through the reduced mass ratio .",
    "we can see from this equation the lso is found by demanding @xmath83 , giving @xmath84 .",
    "we can also see that a pole exists at @xmath85 .",
    "this corresponds to the last unstable circular orbit or photon ring .",
    "however , for the flux function we only have a pn expansion , i.e. @xmath86 .",
    "\\label{eq : flux}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 is the dominant _ newtonian _ flux function given by @xmath88 the coefficients in the expansion of the flux function are given by  @xcite @xmath89 @xmath90 + and + @xmath91 where @xmath92 is euler s constant .",
    "we can see that we begin to encounter logarithmic terms at @xmath93 and above .",
    "it is well know that terms such as these can destroy the convergence of a power series expansion .",
    "in general the chebyshev polynomials of the first kind , @xmath24 , are bound in the domain @xmath19 $ ] . for our purposes",
    "we need the shifted chebyshev polynomials , @xmath94 , which are bound in the domain @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "while the shifted polynomials naturally introduce a linear term , we found it better to forcefully introduce a linear term before expanding in shifted polynomials . to this extent ,",
    "the first part of our analysis mirrors the steps taken in preparing the flux for pading : firstly , factor out the logarithmic terms in the pn expansion to give @xmath95\\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\,c_{_{k}}v^{k}\\right],\\ ] ] where we have normalized the velocity in the log - terms with @xmath96 in order to minimize the effect of these terms as we approach the lso and the coefficients @xmath97 are now in general functions of @xmath96 .",
    "secondly , we introduce a normalized linear term according to @xmath98 where @xmath85 , to give @xmath99 \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\,f_{_{k}}v^{k}\\right ] , \\label{eq : fluxf}\\ ] ] where @xmath100 and @xmath101 @xmath102 .",
    "this is where the similarity stops with the pad based templates .",
    "the next step is to expand both power series in the above equation in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials .",
    "this is done by writing each monomial in the power series in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials ( see appendix  c ) and substituting back into the series above .",
    "so , for example , the shifted chebyshev polynomial @xmath103 , calculated from equation  ( [ eqn : reqeqn2 ] ) , is given by @xmath104 solving this equation for @xmath105 , and using the pre - calculated expressions for the monomials @xmath40 to @xmath106 in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials , we can write @xmath107.\\ ] ] proceeding like this for all monomials , it then allows us to write the power series in the pn expansion solely in terms of the shifted chebyshev polynomials",
    ". the final expressions are @xmath108 and @xmath109 we should emphasise the fact here that although the values of the coefficients @xmath110 are zero up to @xmath93 , the chebyshev expansion includes terms from @xmath111 .",
    "this allows us to define the chebyshev approximation to the gravitational wave flux function as @xmath112 \\left[\\sum_{k=0}^{11}\\,\\lambda_{_{k}}t_{n}^{*}(v)\\right],\\ ] ] where we re - introduce the pole at the photon ring .",
    ".the top two lines give the truncation errors associated with each order of approximation for both the pn and chebyshev flux functions .",
    "the bottom two lines give the total truncation error incurred as we reduce the order of approximation from 5.5 to 2 pn . [",
