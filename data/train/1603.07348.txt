    "<S> there has been increasing interest in studying the richardson model from which one can derive the exact solution for certain pairing hamiltonians . however , it is still a numerical challenge to solve the nonlinear equations involved . in this paper </S>",

    "<S> the total energy is given as a sum of richardson variables as @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages of the above model over the exact diagonalization method include : there is no dimension limitation and the richardson variable thus defined may provide interesting information on the pairing correlation of each pair . </S>",
    "<S> the latter problem can be of fundamental importance by considering the fact that all pairs condense to the same state within the bcs ansatz where s they are all different within the exact model .    </S>",
