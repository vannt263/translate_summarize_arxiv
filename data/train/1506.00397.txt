    "we focus on an idealized model for an electrostatically actuated microelectromechanical system ( mems ) .",
    "the device is built of a thin conducting elastic plate being clamped at its boundary above a rigid conducting plate .",
    "a coulomb force is induced across the device by holding the ground and the elastic plates at different electric potentials which results in a deflection of the elastic plate and thus in a change in geometry of the device , see figure  [ memsfig ] .",
    "an ubiquitous feature of such mems devices is the occurrence of the so - called `` pull - in '' instability which manifests above a critical threshold for the voltage difference in a touchdown of the elastic plate on the rigid ground plate . estimating this threshold value is of utmost interest in applications as it determines the stable operating regime for such a mems device . to set up a mathematical model",
    "we assume that the dynamics of the device can be fully described by the deflection of the elastic plate from its rest position ( when no voltage difference exists ) and the electrostatic potential in the varying region between the two plates .",
    "we further assume that the elastic plate in its rest position and the fixed ground plate can be described by a region @xmath1 in @xmath2 .",
    "after a suitable scaling the rigid ground plate is located at @xmath3 and the rest position of the elastic plate is at @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath5 for @xmath6 and @xmath7 describes the vertical displacement of the elastic plate from its rest position , then @xmath8 evolves in the damping dominated regime according to @xmath9 with clamped boundary conditions @xmath10 and initial condition @xmath11 here we put @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the aspect ratio of the device , i.e. the ratio between vertical and horizontal dimensions , @xmath14 is proportional to the square of the applied voltage difference , and @xmath15 denotes the dimensionless electrostatic potential .",
    "the latter satisfies a rescaled laplace equation @xmath16 in the cylinder @xmath17 between the rigid ground plate at @xmath3 and the deflected elastic plate .",
    "the boundary conditions for @xmath18 are @xmath19 in equation , the fourth - order term @xmath20 with @xmath21 reflects plate bending while the linear second - order term @xmath22 with @xmath23 and the non - local second - order term @xmath24 with @xmath25 and @xmath26 account for external stretching and self - stretching forces generated by large oscillations , respectively .",
    "the right - hand side of is due to the electrostatic forces exerted on the elastic plate and is tuned by the strength of the applied voltage difference which is accounted for by the parameter @xmath0 .",
    "the boundary conditions mean that the elastic plate is clamped .",
    "according to - , the electrostatic potential is harmonic in the region @xmath27 enclosed by the two plates with value  @xmath28 on the elastic plate and value  @xmath29 on the ground plate .",
    "we refer the reader e.g. to @xcite and the references therein for more details on the derivation of the model .",
    "equations - feature a singularity which reflects the pull - in instability occurring when the elastic plate touches down on the ground plate .",
    "indeed , when @xmath8 reaches the value @xmath30 somewhere , the region @xmath27 gets disconnected .",
    "moreover , the imposed boundary conditions imply that the vertical derivative @xmath31 blows up at the touchdown point @xmath32 and , in turn , the right - hand side of becomes singular .",
    "questions regarding ( non-)existence of stationary solutions and of global solutions to the evolution problem as well as the qualitative behavior of the latter are strongly related . due to the intricate coupling of the possibly singular equation and the free boundary problem - in",
    "non - smooth domains , answers are , however , not easy to obtain .",
    "it is thus not surprising that most mathematical research to date has been dedicated to various variants of the so - called _ small gap model _ , a relevant approximation of - obtained by formally setting @xmath33 therein .",
    "this approximation allows one to compute the electrostatic potential @xmath34 explicitly in dependence of @xmath8 , the latter to be determined via @xmath35 subject to and .",
    "we note that this small gap approximation is a singular equation but no longer a free boundary problem .",
    "we refer to @xcite and the references therein for more information on this case .",
    "the free boundary problem - has been investigated in a series of papers by the authors @xcite , though in a simpler geometry assuming @xmath1 to be a rectangle and presupposing zero variation in the @xmath36-direction , see also @xcite for the case of a non - constant permittivity profile . in this geometry",
    "the deflection @xmath37 is independent of @xmath36 and @xmath18 is harmonic in a two - dimensional domain . in the present paper",
    "we remove this assumption and tackle for the first time the evolution problem with a three - dimensional domain @xmath38 , assuming only a convexity property on @xmath1 .",
    "more precisely , we assume in the following that @xmath39 a typical example for @xmath1 is a disc .",
    "we shall see later on that condition   is used to obtain sufficiently smooth solutions to the elliptic problem - in order for the trace of @xmath40 to be well - defined on @xmath41 , a fact which is not clear at first glance as @xmath38 is only a lipschitz domain .",
    "still it turns out that the regularity of the square of the gradient trace of this solution occurring on the right - hand side of is weaker than in the case of a two - dimensional domain @xmath38 studied in @xcite restricting us to study the fourth - order case @xmath21 only , see remark  [ r1 ] for more information .",
