    "when a physical property in the material varies with the direction , the material is said to be anisotropic .",
    "anisotropy of physical properties is a crucial property of materials that are nowadays extremely important in science and technology .",
    "an example of such materials involves the liquid crystals that enable production of several devices used in everyday life ( flat - screen tvs , notebooks , ipads , calculators , etc . ) . even though students are in touch with such devices on a daily basis , they are not aware of anisotropy as a key property of the materials that enable the hi - tech products they use so eagerly . this ignorance might be due to the fact that the concept of anisotropy and in particular its consequences are rather difficult to comprehend .",
    "@xcite it is thus important to introduce the concept of anisotropy as soon as possible , taking into account students knowledge of physics and mathematics .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we focus on birefringence as one of the most widely used properties of anisotropic materials . in a birefringent material there are two distinct waves that can propagate in a general direction determined by the wave vector direction ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "the two waves are linearly polarized , their polarizations being perpendicular .",
    "they travel with different phase velocities , which means that the indices of refraction are different for the two waves although their wave vectors are in the same direction .",
    "both refractive indices depend on the direction of @xmath0 .",
    "an important property of light propagation in anisotropic materials is that the energy ( defined by the poynting vector @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the electric and @xmath3 the magnetic field ) does not propagate in the same direction as the wave vector ( i.e. , the wave fronts propagate in a different direction than the energy ) .",
    "the ray that we see is the direction of energy propagation .",
    "so , in order to avoid confusion , one should strictly state which velocity is considered ( phase or ray velocity ) , and when considering the direction of light propagation , state whether the ray or wave vector direction is being considered .    in a general anisotropic medium",
    "there are two directions of wave vector propagation , along which the two waves travel with the same phase velocity .",
    "these two directions are called the optic axes , and the material is said to be biaxial . in the biaxial material there are also two directions , along which the ray velocities for both waves are equal . these axes are called the ray axes and are distinct from the optic axes .",
    "when optic axes are identical , material is uniaxial . in uniaxial materials the optic and",
    "the ray axes are the same . in optically uniaxial materials",
    "the phase and ray velocities of one of the two waves are equal , independent of the direction of propagation .",
    "this wave is called _ the ordinary wave_. for the second wave , the phase and ray velocities are different in magnitude and direction , and they both depend on the direction of propagation .",
    "this wave is called _ the extraordinary wave_.    the most easily observed and striking optical property of transparent anisotropic materials is double refraction ( birefringence ) : the light incident on the interface between the isotropic and anisotropic material refracts into the anisotropic material in such a way that there are in general two rays of light propagating through the material in different direction ; the light in both rays is polarized ( even if the incident light is not polarized ) ; light polarizations in the two rays are perpendicular .",
    "double refraction is usually demonstrated by observing the doubling of a text observed through the calcite .",
    "@xcite when a polarizer is placed behind the calcite ( or in front of it ) , one of the figures disappears if the polarizer s transmission direction coincides with the polarization of the transmitted light .",
    "although the explanation for this phenomenon is rather straightforward for a trained physicist , it is usually not so easily comprehended by students .",
    "a more straightforward experiment demonstrates the splitting of the unpolarized incident light beam into two beams of linearly polarized light .",
    "one needs a large birefringent crystal that is thick enough so that two transmitted beams can be observed as two light spots on a distant screen . by changing the direction of the incident light by rotating the crystal , one can observe the direction dependency of the extraordinary wave refractive index in uniaxial crystals , as well as the direction dependency of both indices in biaxial crystals .",
    "unfortunately , the accuracy of quantitative measurements for both indices is poor , as any , even slight non - parallelism of the crystal surfaces results in a significant change in the transmitted light direction . since the most easily accessible crystals are biaxial ( e.g. , quartz ) , this additionally complicates the comparison of the experimental results and the theoretical considerations .",
    "liquid crystals are optically anisotropic materials that are easy and cheap to obtain ; even more , they can be synthesized in a school laboratory , not only at the university level but also at the high school level .",
    "liberko , verbit , wright , pavlin by using liquid crystals , the concept of anisotropy can be qualitatively introduced even at the elementary school level . at the high school level",
    ", anisotropic properties can be introduced through a set of carefully designed experiments .",
    "the concept can be efficiently reinforced at the university level , with an interdisciplinary teaching module consisting of lectures and lab work.@xcite the module is appropriate for both social and natural science students .",
    "while such a teaching module has proven to be very efficient in achieving the conceptual understanding of optical anisotropy , physics students also require experiments that allow quantitative measurements .",
    "liquid crystals offer a possibility to measure angular dependency of the refractive index in uniaxial materials . in this paper",
    "we present an experiment that enables quantitative measurements of the refractive index for light propagating at angles ranging from @xmath4 to @xmath5 with respect to the optic axis .",
    "in an anisotropic dielectric material , the polarization ( @xmath6 ) in the material depends on the direction of the external electric field ( @xmath7 ) , and it is , in general , not in the direction of the external field .",
    "this property is described by the electric susceptibility ( ) being a tensor quantity ( not scalar , as in isotropic materials ) , and the relation between the material polarization and the electric field is:@xmath8light is the propagation of an electromagnetic wave .",
    "the electric field in the electromagnetic wave interacts with the material and induces polarization , which varies over time with the same frequency as the frequency of light .",
    "interaction of light with matter reduces the speed of light . in materials where the field induced polarization is larger ( materials with greater electric susceptibility ) ,",
    "the speed of light is lower .",
    "the ratio between the speed of light in a vacuum and in a particular material is given by the index of refraction . since in anisotropic materials polarization in the material",
    "depends on the direction of the external electric field , in such materials the index of refraction varies with the direction of light propagation , and it depends on the direction of the electric field ( i.e. , the direction of light polarization ) .",
    "we point out that polarization of light ( direction of @xmath7 in light ) should not be confused with material polarization ( @xmath6 ) , which is a result of @xmath2 in light .",
    "the reader should once again carefully examine eq .",
    "( [ eq : pol ] ) to fully grasp the difference .",
    "propagation of light is described by the wave equation .",
    "we shall assume a nonmagnetic material ( no magnetization due to the external magnetic field ) that contains no volume charge and no conducting current .",
    "assuming a monochromatic plane wave with frequency @xmath9 propagating in any direction given by the wave vector @xmath10 , the electric and magnetic field vectors may be described by the harmonic representation , e.g. @xmath11 .",
    "the general _ plane wave equation _ in the anisotropic media is @xcite @xmath12where @xmath13 is the magnitude of the wave vector in a vacuum , and @xmath14 is the dielectric tensor ; it is the sum of an identity tensor and the electric susceptibility .",
    "for ordinary nonabsorbing materials the dielectric tensor is symmetric , so there always exists a coordinate system with a set of axes , called the principal axes , in which the dielectric tensor is diagonal . in optically uniaxial materials with the optic axis in the @xmath15-direction ,",
    "the @xmath16- and @xmath17-components of the dielectric tensor are equal : @xmath18where @xmath19 is called the ordinary and @xmath20 the extraordinary index of refraction .",
    "we shall solve the wave equation only for a special case of the wave vector direction , assuming that the wave vector is in the @xmath21-plane : @xmath22 .",
    "for the electric field , we assume a general direction @xmath23",
    ". one can not assume that the electric field is perpendicular to the wave vector , since such orthogonality is valid only in isotropic materials .",
    "using the ansatz for @xmath0 and @xmath2 and the expression ( [ eq : eps ] ) for the dielectric tensor , a set of three equations is obtained from the wave equation ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : valovnaen ] ) ) : @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26the nontrivial solutions of the set of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : we1 ] ) - ( [ eq : we3 ] ) are obtained if the determinant of the coefficients in front of @xmath27 is zero .",
    "the determinant is zero if one of the conditions    @xmath28    or    @xmath29    is satisfied .",
    "the condition ( [ eq : krog ] ) gives the magnitude of the wave vector in the anisotropic material , a magnitute that is the same for all directions of propagation in the @xmath21-plane .",
    "this solution presents the ordinary wave .",
    "the refractive index for the ordinary wave is isotropic and equal to @xmath30 .",
    "( [ eq : elipsa ] ) presents the constraint on the magnitude of the wave vector of the extraordinary wave .",
    "the allowed magnitudes of the wave vectors lie on an ellipse for the extraordinary wave and on a circle for the ordinary wave ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elip ] ) .",
    "when rotated around the optic axis , the circle draws the surface of a sphere , and the ellipse the surface of an ellipsoid ; we thus obtain the wave vector surfaces , giving us the magnitude of the wave vector for light propagation in a general direction .",
    "the reader is referred to any book in modern optics to prove this , or he / she can check it on his own by choosing different planes of wave vector direction ( for example , to the already studied @xmath21-plane , consider also the @xmath31- and the @xmath32-plane ) .    expressing the magnitude of the wave vector of the extraordinary wave as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the index of refraction of the extraordinary wave for the light propagating with the wave vector at an angle @xmath35 with respect to the optic axis",
    ", the wave vector can be expressed as @xmath36 . using this expression , the angular dependence of the index of refraction",
    "can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : elipsa ] ) : @xmath37the ordinary and extraordinary waves are linearly polarized . by using the condition ( [ eq : krog ] ) in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : we1 ] ) - ( [ eq : we3 ] ) , we find that @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "the ordinary wave is thus linearly polarized in the @xmath17-direction , i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the plane defined by the optic axis and the wave vector .",
    "when the condition ( eq : elipsa ) is used in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : we1 ] ) - ( [ eq : we3 ] ) , we find that @xmath40 while @xmath41 and @xmath42 can be different from zero .",
    "the polarization of the extraordinary wave is in the plane defined by the optic axis and the wave vector and is thus perpendicular to the polarization of the ordinary wave . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq : we1 ] ) and ( [ eq : we3 ] ) , it is straightforward to show that the polarization of the extraordinary wave is along the @xmath15-axis if @xmath0 is along the @xmath16-axis and vice versa . to find the direction of @xmath2 in the extraordinary wave with @xmath0 at a general angle with respect to the optic axis , is more elaborate",
    "so we state without a proof that @xmath2 is always in the direction tangential to the ellipse .",
    "the direction of the ray ( meaning the direction of the energy propagation and the direction of the ray velocity ) at a given direction of @xmath0 ( the direction of the phase velocity ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : elip ] .",
    "the difference in the two directions is obvious .",
    "however , one must bear in mind that even in materials with large anisotropy , the ratio between the ordinary and the extraordinary index is of the order of 10 % , so the actual difference in the direction of propagation of @xmath0 and @xmath43 is much smaller . in calcite @xmath44 , in quartz @xmath45 and in liquid crystals , where the anisotropy is very large , @xmath46 for the liquid crystal used in the experiment presented in this paper .      when a beam of unpolarized light is incident on the anisotropic uniaxial transparent medium , it refracts into two beams .",
    "the direction of the wave vectors for the two beams is determined by the boundary conditions at the interface ; these conditions follow from applying the maxwell equations to suitable regions containing the interface .",
    "the boundary conditions give us the amplitude matching condition , which determines the reflectivity and the transmissivity at the interface , and the phase matching condition , which leads to the law of reflection and law of refraction .",

    "nematic liquid crystals are composed of elongated molecules with orientationally ordered long molecular axes .",
    "the average direction of the long molecular axes is called the director .",
    "since all directions of molecular motion in the direction perpendicular to the long molecular axis are equally probable , the system is optically uniaxial with the optic axis along the director . in bulky samples , clusters of oriented molecules",

    "one can write snell s law as    @xmath115    the angle @xmath35 between the optic axis and the wave vector direction of the extraordinary / ordinary wave is equal to @xmath76 in the homeotropic cell and @xmath116 in the planar cell ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : celice ] ) .            as explained above",
    ", the sandwiched cells provide extra measurements of refractive indices at angles @xmath35 close to @xmath106 .",
    "since we have two cells with different alignments of molecules and two different orientations of sandwich as in figs .",
    "[ fig : slikasendvica ] and fig : sendvicshema , the refractive indices in four different directions of light propagation in the cell with respect to the optical axis can be measured .",
    "these measurements are shown as green diamonds in fig .",
    "fig : graf .",
    "one can clearly see that the accuracy of the refractive index measurement when the wedge cell is fixed between the prisms is much lower than when the prisms are absent .",
    "the reason is the glycerol , because it forms a slight wedge as well , which could not be precisely controlled . in most cases ,",
    "the wedge of the glycerol has the same orientation as the wedge of the liquid crystalline cell , a fact which results in larger values for refractive indices .",
    "less frequently , the glycerol wedge is in the opposite direction , which leads to lower values for the refractive index .",
    "the effect was verified in the absence of the liquid crystal .",
    "nevertheless , the experiment nicely shows that values of the refractive indices at @xmath35between @xmath94 and @xmath117 are consistent with the calculated direction dependence of the refractive index of the extraordinary wave in the uniaxial liquid crystal .",
    "students are confronted by the difficult concept of birefringence during physics lessons at university .",
    "we have shown that the concept can be fully demonstrated by using nematic liquid crystalline wedge cells with different orientation of molecules .",
    "most important , the experiment , the setup of which consists of a laser , rotatable table , two different wedge cells , two prisms with an apex angle of @xmath106 and a drop of glycerol , enables quantitative measurements of the angular dependence of the refractive index of the extraordinary wave for the whole range of propagation directions .",
    "the homeotropic cell permits the demonstration of the direction dependency of the refractive index of the extraordinary wave , as well as its measurement , when its value is close to the value of the ordinary refractive index .",
    "the planar cell can be used for quantitative measurement of the refractive index direction dependency close to its largest value . by using additional glass prisms to form a sandwich of prisms and the wedge cell",
    ", one can study the angular dependency of the refractive indices in a range of directions that can not be attained with a simple setup .",
    "the authors are grateful to miha karabot for producing the wedge cells , to martina ubic for the control set of measurements and to igor muevi for pointing out the paper by barnik _",
    "et al_.  @xcite this work was supported by the project j5 - 4002 financed by the slovenian research agency ( arrs ) .                        for a quick overview",
    ", we suggest the concise treatment in ref .  , but , of course , any book on optics or modern optics ( as refs .  ) will also have a thorough treatment of light propagation in anisotropic media .",
    "nematic liquid crystals with appropriate properties are commercially available from several companies like merck , sigma aldrich or nematel .",
    "different commercial mixtures are available which are in the liquid crystalline state around the room temperature .",
    "the measurements can be done with any nematic liquid crystals that have the nematic phase at the room temperature and have high birefringence .",
