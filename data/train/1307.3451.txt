    "the main result of the paper is the following theorem .",
    "[ optx ] let @xmath7 be a standard normal random variable .",

    "inequality ( [ optx ] ) was first obtained by pinelis @xcite with @xmath20 .",
    "bobkov , g \" otze and houdr ( bgh ) @xcite gave a simple proof of ( [ optx ] ) with constant factor @xmath21 .",
    "their method was to use induction on @xmath22 together with the inequality @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . using a method similar to the one in bgh @xcite , bentkus @xcite proved ( [ optx ] ) with @xmath26 and conjectured that the optimal constant in ( [ optx ] ) is @xmath27 .",
    "further progress was achieved by pinelis @xcite , where ( [ optx ] ) was proved with @xmath28 .",
    "let us briefly outline our strategy of the proof .",
    "for @xmath29 theorem  [ optx ] follows from the symmetry of @xmath30 . for @xmath31",
    "we consider two cases separately .",
    "if @xmath32 and all @xmath33 s are `` small '' we use berry  esseen inequality .",
    "otherwise we use induction on @xmath22 together with chebyshev type inequality presented in lemma  [ inequality ] .",
    "we remark that the analysis of weighted sums of random variables based on separate study of these two cases has proved recently to be effective idea , see @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "this idea was used to obtain asymptotically gaussian bound @xmath34 where @xmath35 .    a standard application of bounds like ( [ optx ] ) , following efron @xcite , is to the student s statistic and to self - normalized sums .",
    "for example , if random variables @xmath36 are independent ( not necessary identically distributed ) , symmetric and not all identically equal to zero , then the statistic @xmath37 is sub - gaussian and @xmath38 the latter inequality is optimal since it turns into an equality if @xmath39 , @xmath18 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 . this inequality was previously obtained in @xcite with constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 in place of @xmath44 .",
    "in this section , we use the following notation @xmath45 that is , @xmath46 is the tail probability for standard normal random variable @xmath47 and @xmath48 is the standard normal density . without loss of generality , we assume that @xmath49 and @xmath50 . using ( [ cheb2 ] )",
    "we have @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "the random variable @xmath53 is symmetric and independent of @xmath54 .",

    "to prove ( [ in1 ] ) , we use the obvious inequality @xmath64 where @xmath65 stands for the indicator function of the event @xmath66 . taking expectation ,",
    "we get ( [ in1 ] ) .    in similarity to ( [ in1 ] ) , one can derive a number of inequalities stronger than the standard chebyshev inequality @xmath67 .",
    "for example , instead of @xmath68 we have the much stronger @xmath69    we will make use of lyapunov type bounds with explicit constants for the remainder term in the central limit theorem .",
    "let @xmath70 be independent random variables such that @xmath71 for all @xmath72 .",

    "note that we actually do not need the best known bound for @xmath78 .",
    "even @xmath79 suffices to prove theorem  [ optx ] .    replacing @xmath80 by @xmath81 and using @xmath82 for all @xmath72 , the inequality ( [ clt0a ] ) implies @xmath83    proof of theorem  [ optx ] for @xmath29 theorem  [ optx ] follows from the symmetry of @xmath30 and chebyshev s inequality ( first it was implicitly shown in @xcite , later in @xcite ) . in the case",
    "@xmath84 , we argue by induction on @xmath22 .",
    "however , let us first provide a proof of theorem  [ optx ] in some special cases where induction fails .    using the bound ( [ clt ] ) , let us prove theorem  [ optx ] under the assumption that @xmath85 using @xmath86 , the numerical value of @xmath87 is @xmath88 .",

    "in this case in order to prove theorem  [ optx ] , we have to improve the arguments used to estimate the right - hand side of ( [ cheb3 ] ) .",
