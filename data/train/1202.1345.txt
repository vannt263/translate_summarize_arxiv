    "dust enrichment in galaxies is one of the most important topics in galaxy evolution .",
    "dust grains actually modify the spectral energy distribution of galaxies by reprocessing stellar radiation into far - infrared wavelengths ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "grain surfaces also regulate interstellar chemistry ; especially , formation of molecular hydrogen predominantly occurs on dust grains if the interstellar medium ( ism ) is enriched with dust ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these effects of dust grains point to the importance of clarifying the dust enrichment in galaxies ( see @xcite for a recent modeling ) .",
    "dust enrichment is governed by various processes depending on age , metallicity , etc.@xcite .",
    "dust grains are supplied by stellar sources such as supernovae ( sne ) and asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "dust is also destroyed by sn shocks in the ism . in the milky way ,",
    "the time - scale of dust destruction by sn shocks is @xmath2  yr ( @xcite ; but see @xcite ) , while that of dust supply from stellar sources is longer than 1  gyr @xcite .",
    "therefore , to explain a significant amount of dust in the ism , it has been argued that dust grains grow in the ism by the accretion of metals onto grains @xcite .",
    "dust grains grow efficiently in molecular clouds , where the typical number density of hydrogen molecules is @xmath3 @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "larger depletion of metal elements in cold clouds than in warm medium @xcite may indicate grain growth in clouds .",
    "in dense environments , dust grains grow not only by accretion but also by coagulation .",
    "indeed , a deficit of very small grains contributing to the 60 @xmath5 emission is observed around a typical density in molecular clouds @xmath6 @xmath4 , and is interpreted to be a consequence of coagulation @xcite .",
    "thus , we should treat accretion and coagulation at the same time , since these two processes could compete or collaborate with each other .",
    "moreover , accretion and coagulation may have different impacts on the extinction @xcite : coagulation shifts the grain sizes to larger ranges and flattens the extinction curve , while accretion also increases the extinction itself . which of these two effects dominates",
    "can also be clarified by solving accretion and coagulation simultaneously .",
    "thus , we examine in this paper how these two major processes of grain growth  accretion and coagulation  interplay . we also investigate the impact of grain growth in clouds on the extinction curve .",
    "when the dense clouds are dispersed after their lifetimes , the dust grains grown through accretion and coagulation are injected into the diffuse medium , where dust destruction by sn shocks occurs @xcite .",
    "@xcite show that grain shattering is also efficient in the diffuse ism .",
    "thus , our calculation results in this paper , which focuses on grain growth in clouds , can be used as ` inputs ' for subsequent grain destruction and shattering .",
    "sn shocks do not penetrate efficiently into dense environments and dust destruction by sn shocks can be neglected in dense clouds @xcite .",
    "other possible dust processing mechanisms in dense clouds such as destruction by protostellar jets and photo - destruction by radiation from stars are also neglected , since the efficiencies of these processes are not clear yet .",
    "thus , we do not treat these destructive processes and concentrate on the grain growth mechanisms ( i.e.  accretion and coagulation ) that work in the dense ism .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we explain the formulation in section [ sec : formula ] , and describe some basic results on the evolution of grain size distribution through grain growth ( accretion and coagulation ) in individual clouds in section [ sec : result ] . based on the calculation results , we discuss effects on the extinction curve and implication for the galaxy evolution in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "finally , section [ sec : conclusion ] gives the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we formulate the evolution of grain size distribution by the accretion of metals and the growth by coagulation in an interstellar cloud .",
    "these two processes are simply called accretion and coagulation in this paper .",
    "we particularly focus on the interplay between accretion and coagulation .    throughout this paper , we call the elements composing grains ` metals ' . we only treat grains refractory enough to survive after the dispersal of the cloud , and do not consider volatile grains such as water ice .",
    "we also assume that the grains are spherical with a constant material density @xmath7 , so that the grain mass @xmath8 and the grain radius @xmath9 are related as @xmath10    we define the grain size distribution such that @xmath11 is the number density of grains whose radii are between @xmath9 and @xmath12 at time @xmath13 . for simplicity , we assume that the gas density is constant and that the evolution of grain size distribution occurs only through accretion and coagulation . the dust mass density , @xmath14 is estimated as @xmath15 we adopt silicate and graphite as dominant grain species ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ) , and treat these two species separately to avoid the complexity arising from compound species .    accretion and coagulation are separately described in the following subsections , but we solve these two processes simultaneously in the calculation .",
    "the details of the numerical schemes are explained in appendix [ app : discrete ] .      because the knowledge about chemical properties of accretion is still poor @xcite ,",
    "we simplify the picture by assuming that grain growth is regulated by the sticking of the key species denoted as x ( x is si and c for silicate and graphite , respectively ; ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hk11 ) ) .",
    "the mass fraction of the key species in dust is denoted as @xmath16 : @xmath17 for silicate ( i.e.  a fraction of 0.166 of silicate is composed of si ) , while @xmath18 for graphite ( i.e.  graphite is composed of only c ) ( table [ tab : material ] ) .",
    "we follow the formulation in our previous paper ( hk11 ; see also @xcite ) , but modified for the purpose of numerical calculations .",
    "since the grain number is conserved in accretion , the following continuity equation in terms of @xmath19 holds : @xmath20 = 0 , \\label{eq : continuity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the growth rate of the grain radius , which is given by the following form ( hk11 ) : @xmath22 here the growth time - scale as a function of grain radius , @xmath23 , is estimated as @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number density of element x in both gas and dust phases , @xmath26 is the atomic mass of x , @xmath27 is the sticking probability for accretion , @xmath16 is the mass fraction of the key species in the dust ( see above ) , @xmath28 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath29 is the gas temperature . in equation ( [ eq : dadt ] ) , we also introduce the fraction of element @xmath30 in gas phase : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the number density of element x in gas phase as a function of time . note",
    "that @xmath33 is independent of @xmath9 .",
    "the gas - phase metals decrease by accretion as @xmath34    since we are often interested in the grain mass , it will be convenient to consider the grain size distribution per unit grain mass rather than per unit grain radius . thus , we define @xmath35 as the number density of grains with mass between @xmath8 and @xmath36 .",
    "the two functions , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , are related by @xmath39 ; that is , @xmath40 by using equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) .",
    "then , the time evolution of @xmath37 is obtained from equation ( [ eq : continuity ] ) as @xmath41 where we have used equation ( [ eq : mass ] ) , @xmath42 , @xmath43\\partial /\\partial a$ ] , and @xmath44 .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath45 as @xmath46 then , equation ( [ eq : dndt_acc1 ] ) is reduced to @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 . noting that @xmath50",
    ", we obtain from equation ( [ eq : dadt ] ) @xmath51 where @xmath52 is now expressed as a function of @xmath8 instead of @xmath9 .",
    "the evolution of @xmath53 is calculated by ( equations [ eq : tau ] , [ eq : xi ] , [ eq : depletion ] , and [ eq : sigma ] ) @xmath54 we solve equations ( [ eq : continuity_sigma ] ) , ( [ eq : dmudt ] ) , and ( [ eq : dxidt ] ) .",
    "the discretized form of equation ( [ eq : continuity_sigma ] ) is shown in appendix [ app : continuity ] .",
    "the initial conditions are described in section [ subsec : initial ] .      for the evolution of grain size distribution by coagulation",
    ", we apply the formulation developed in our previous work @xcite . here",
    "we adopt an analytic formula derived by @xcite for the turbulent velocities .",
    "below we briefly overview the method , focusing on the treatment of the grain velocities .",
    "we consider thermal ( brownian ) motion and turbulent motion as a function of grain mass ( or radius , which is related to the mass by equation [ eq : mass ] ) .",
    "the turbulent motion becomes important particularly for large grains @xcite .",
    "the velocity as a function of grain mass @xmath8 is given by a combination of thermal ( brownian ) and turbulent velocities ( @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively ) as @xmath57 the thermal velocity is given by @xmath58 @xcite , which is numerically evaluated as @xmath59 the velocity driven by turbulence is given by @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the number density of the molecular gas , which is related to the number density of hydrogen nuclei , @xmath62 , as @xmath63 for the cosmic abundance @xcite in @xcite should be @xmath63 ( note that @xmath61 is denoted as @xmath38 in @xcite ) .",
    "we can also easily check the validity of the `` intermediate regime '' by using the estimates in @xcite : with @xmath64 k and @xmath65 @xmath4 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 , where st is the stokes number and re is the reynolds number .",
    "thus , the condition for the intermediate regime , @xmath68 , is satisfied in the size range where the turbulent motion is dominant over the thermal motion .",
    "@xcite adopted larger size and velocity for the largest eddies , so re is larger than assumed above .",
    "in such a case , the intermediate regime is completely valid for all grain sizes treated in this paper . ] .",
    "in fact , equation ( [ eq : v_turb ] ) represents the relative velocity of equal - sized grains .",
    "we adopt this as a typical velocity for the following reasons : ( i ) a simple form for the velocity as a function of grain size fits our approximate treatment of the relative velocity ( see below ) ; ( ii ) the relative velocity is determined by the velocity of the larger grain , which is coupled with the larger - scale turbulent motion , so the relative velocity is always of the order of @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the radius of the larger grain ; ( iii ) the uncertainty caused by this rough treatment of relative velocities , compared with the analytic solution given by equation ( 28 ) of @xcite , is within a factor of 1.3 .",
    "grain velocities are dominated by thermal motion for small grains ( @xmath71 ) , while turbulence drives the motion of large grains efficiently .",
    "if the grain size is too large , the grain velocity becomes larger than the coagulation threshold , which is calculated by the same way as @xcite .",
    "yet , the grain velocities ( @xmath72 km s@xmath73 ) are too small for shattering or erosion to occur @xcite . for a grain colliding with @xmath74 grains , coagulation occurs if the grain has a size smaller than @xmath75 .",
    "each time - step is divided into four equal small steps , and we apply @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 ( @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the grain velocities evaluated at @xmath80 and @xmath81 , respectively , and @xmath82 is the relative velocity in the collision between two grains in bins @xmath28 and @xmath83 ; see appendix [ app : coag ] for the discrete formulation ) in each step to consider a variety of relative velocity directions @xcite .",
    "the initial grain size distribution is assumed to be described by a power - law function with power index @xmath84 and upper and lower bounds for the grain radii @xmath85 and @xmath86 , respectively : @xmath87 for @xmath88 . if @xmath89 or @xmath90 , @xmath91 . the dust mass density at @xmath92",
    ", @xmath93 satisfies equation ( [ eq : rho_d ] ) , and is given later by equation ( [ eq : rho_d0 ] ) .",
    "the dust mass density is related to the initial condition for @xmath53 as @xmath94n_\\mathrm{x , tot}$ ] , and the total number density of element x both in gas and dust phases is written as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the metallicity , and ( x / h)@xmath97 is the solar abundance ( the ratio of the number of x nuclei to that of hydrogen nuclei at the solar metallicity ) , and @xmath62 is the number density of hydrogen nuclei .",
    "therefore , @xmath93 is related to the initial condition for @xmath53 as @xmath98 \\left(\\frac{z}{\\mathrm{z}_{\\sun}}\\right ) \\left(\\frac{\\mathrm{x}}{\\mathrm{h}}\\right)_{\\sun } n_\\mathrm{h}.\\label{eq : rho_d0}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we apply @xmath99 ( note that the time - scales of both accretion and coagulation are simply scaled as @xmath100 ) .",
    "we assume @xmath101 , which roughly matches the depletion in the diffuse medium @xcite .",
    "although there is uncertainty in the depletion because of the assumed elemental abundance pattern ( usually the solar abundance pattern is assumed ) , the following discussions on the evolution of grain size distribution are not altered as long as we adopt a reasonable value such as @xmath1020.7 .",
    "@xcite show that the extinction curve in the milky way can be fitted with a power - law grain size distribution with @xmath103 .",
    "thus , we assume that @xmath103 .",
    "the effect of @xmath104 on accretion has already been investigated by hk11 . briefly ,",
    "for larger @xmath104 , small grains occupy a larger fraction of total dust surface and the total grain surface becomes larger ; as a consequence , the grain growth occurs more rapidly for larger @xmath104 .",
    "since the largest grains are not susceptible to accretion and coagulation as we show later , we fix the maximum size as @xmath105 @xcite",
    ". the lower bound of the grain size is poorly determined from the extinction curve @xcite ; thus , we examine @xmath106 and 1 nm .      as mentioned at the beginning of this section , we consider silicate and graphite separately .",
    "the quantities adopted in this paper are summarized in table [ tab : material ] , and are based on hk11 . since we are interested in the interplay between accretion and coagulation , we fix parameters which do not affect the relation between those two processes .

    "in this paper , we have focused on grain growth processes in interstellar clouds .",
    "we have formulated and calculated the evolution of grain size distribution by accretion and coagulation in an interstellar cloud .",
    "destructive processes are neglected in this paper , since they are considered to be ineffective in dense regions .",
    "we have confirmed the previous analytic results that grains smaller than @xmath112 are depleted by accretion on a time - scale of several myr .",
    "coagulation also occurs on a similar time - scale , but accretion has a prominent impact in making a large bump in the grain size distribution around @xmath113 because of the grain mass increase .",
    "after a major part of the gas phase metals are used up , accretion stops and coagulation is the only mechanism that pushes the grains toward larger sizes .",
    "it is only at this stage that grain motion driven by turbulence can affect the evolution of grain size distribution .",
    "regardless of whether accretion takes place or not , the typical grain size achieved by coagulation is similar .",
    "we have also examined the grain mass increase during the cloud lifetime by introducing @xmath114 in equation ( [ eq : beta ] ) such that the grain mass becomes @xmath115 times as much as the initial value .",
    "we have found that coagulation slightly suppresses accretion although this effect is not significant and can be neglected in discussing the evolution of the total grain mass in galaxies .",
    "in other words , coagulation can be neglected in discussing the evolution of the total grain mass in galaxies .",
    "finally , we have investigated the effects of accretion and coagulation on the extinction curve .",
    "we have found that accretion enhances the uv slope and the carbon bump in spite of the increases in the mean grain radius .",
