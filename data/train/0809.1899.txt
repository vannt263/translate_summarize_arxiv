    "the direct detection of a gravitational wave background will provide us with a probe of physical conditions in the early universe at the epoch when the gravitational radiation was generated .",
    "this is because gravitational waves are massless and after generation weakly - coupled gravitational radiation propagates freely .",
    "hence , once generated , any gravitational wave spectrum retains its shape , with all wavelengths simply scaling with the expansion of the universe .",
    "gravitational wave astronomy holds the potential for helping construct a picture of the universe at energy scales even higher than those the large hadron collider will reach , to probe in detail physics at the electroweak energy scale .",
    "there are various mechanisms that might generate gravitational waves in the early universe , for reviews see  @xcite .",
    "a well - known one is parametric amplification of quantum fluctuations  @xcite , which can also take place shortly after inflation  @xcite .",
    "other mechanisms include bubble wall motion and collisions during phase transitions ; gravitational wave generation during the electroweak and qcd phase transitions are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . cosmic strings and other defects",
    "can produce relic gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "cosmological magnetic fields  @xcite and hydrodynamical or magnetohydrodynamical turbulence can also induce primordial gravitational waves  @xcite .",
    "gravitational waves will also provide information on symmetries present in the universe .",
    "in particular , the relic gravitational wave background carries information about parity asymmetry , that might be generated at the electroweak phase transition , or earlier .",
    "parity symmetry testing based on the direct detection of gravitational waves in the near future ( with currently planned missions ) seems to be promising for gravitational waves with frequencies around the laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) sensitivity band at @xmath0 mhz  @xcite .",
    "the standard model electroweak phase transition , when parity symmetry breaking and magnetic helicity production might be expected  @xcite , produces gravitational waves with a significant amplitude in this frequency range .",
    "recently , some of us have investigated the generation of gravitational waves through inverse cascade mhd turbulence  @xcite and found that even a small amount of initial helicity enlarges the range of phase transition parameters for which gravitational waves are potentially detectable by lisa .",
    "this gravitational wave signal has an important feature : it is circularly polarized . for direct cascade hydrodynamical turbulence some of us have previously estimated the polarization degree  @xcite , which is obviously turbulence model dependent . polarized gravitational waves are present in other models  @xcite , and the polarization of the gravitational wave background is in principle observable , either directly  @xcite or through the cosmic microwave background  @xcite .",
    "the detection prospects of gravitational radiation from the early universe depend on the energy scale when gravitational waves were generated and even more so on the source duration time and efficiency of the generation process itself . in particular , to produce a detectable signal the electroweak phase transition must be strong enough  @xcite . the currently popular standard model of particle physics does not have a strong enough electroweak phase transition . also , all currently discussed electroweak phase transition models do not predict an observable gravitational radiation signal if one assumes only bubble collisions  @xcite .",
    "it is of particular interest to study gravitational wave production during phase transitions in the minimal and next to minimal supersymmetric standard models ( mssm and nmssm @xcite ) , @xcite .",
    "the gravitational wave signal produced in the mssm model is below the lisa sensitivity , while the nmssm results in a stronger electroweak phase transition @xcite and as a consequence a detectable gravitational wave signal @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , sources associated with stochastic vector fields in plasma , i.e.  kinetic velocity or magnetic fields , significantly change gravitational wave detection prospects  @xcite . in the case of unmagnetized hydrodynamical turbulence the peak frequency of the gravitational wave power spectrum is determined by the characteristic time of turbulence , i.e. the inverse turn - over time of the largest eddy .",
    "another important characteristic is the energy scale when gravitational radiation is generated . in recent modifications of the standard electroweak phase transition model where the transition is moved to a higher energy scale  @xcite ,",
    "the gravitational wave power spectrum peak frequency is shifted to a higher frequency , which , since the gravitational wave spectrum is sharply peaked , reduces the possibility of detection by lisa .",
    "the presence of a cosmological magnetic field affects the dynamics of turbulence . in the case of mhd turbulence",
    "the presence of an energy inverse - cascade leads to an increase in the effective size of the largest eddy ( now associated with a helical magnetic field ) , and can result in the gravitational wave power spectrum peaking in the lisa band , with amplitude large enough to be detected by lisa  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "@xcite by also considering a different model of mhd turbulence .",

    "we adapt the technique developed in ref .",
    "we model mhd turbulence and obtain the gravitational wave spectrum by using an analogy with the theory of sound wave production by hydrodynamical turbulence  @xcite .",

    "we assume that the kinetic and magnetic reynolds numbers are much greater than unity on scales of order @xmath7 , otherwise there is no turbulence .",
    "we also assume that the duration of the turbulence , @xmath8 , is no larger than the hubble time at the phase transition @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the value of the hubble parameter at the phase transition , so the expansion of the universe may be neglected during the generation of gravitational radiation  @xcite .",
    "this adiabatic assumption will be valid for any turbulence produced in a realistic cosmological phase transition  @xcite .",

    "we have analyzed the generation of gravitational waves at the electroweak phase transition , from hydrodynamic turbulence in the presence of a helical magnetic field .",
    "it is convenient to consider this as a two - stage process . during the first stage",
    "the effects of helicity are negligible when studying the production of gravitational waves from turbulence .",
    "the first stage ends when quasi - conservation of magnetic helicity starts to trigger an inverse cascade of the magnetic field , that is , a transfer of magnetic energy from small to large scales .",
    "the details of the inverse cascade process in helical mhd are still under debate and there exist in the literature two different models . in this paper",
    "we have examined gravitational wave generation in both models of helical mhd turbulence .",
    "we have found that , for realistic values of the parameters defining the electroweak phase transition , the generated gravitational wave spectrum is independent of turbulence modeling ( within a factor of order 2 ) .",
    "the inverse - cascade associated peak frequency always coincides with the hubble frequency at the moment of gravitational wave production .",
    "moreover , as clear from fig .  1 ,",
    "the main contribution to the total gravitational waves energy density is from the second , inverse - cascade stage , even for small values of magnetic helicity .",
    "gravitational waves produced _ via _ helical turbulence are strongly polarized , since magnetic helicity is a parity - odd quantity and is maximal at the end of the first stage  @xcite .",
    "lisa should be able to detect such a gravitational wave polarization  @xcite .",
    "also , in contrast to the unmagnetized case , the contribution to the gravitational wave amplitude coming from the inverse - cascade stage is large enough at @xmath220 mhz to be detectable by lisa . if the electroweak phase transition occurs at higher energy ( see fig .",
    "2 ) the peak frequency is higher , closer to the lisa sensitivity peak , which leads to a stronger signal .",
    "our formalism is also applicable to gravitational wave production at an earlier qcd phase transition , assuming the presence of colored magnetic fields  @xcite , or to any other phase transition  @xcite : the peak frequency will shift according to changes in @xmath3 and @xmath50 .",
    "finally , we stress that the gravitational wave signal arising from helical mhd turbulent motion exceeds that from bubble collisions  @xcite and that from hydrodynamical turbulence alone  @xcite . of course , the strong signal estimated here ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) assumes initial non - zero ( although small ) magnetic helicity , so detection of polarized gravitational waves by lisa will indicate parity violation during the phase transition , as proposed in refs .",
