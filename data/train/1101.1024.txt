    "conformal field theory ( cft ) has different formulations as well as multiple applications .",
    "one of the best known applications concerns the theory of 2d lattice models at their critical points .",
    "borrowing ideas and intuition from quantum field theory , belavin , polyakov , and zamolodchikov @xcite introduced an operator algebra formalism which relates some critical models to the representation theory of virasoro algebra .",
    "the underlying objects of bpz theory are correlation functions of certain  fields , \" apparently smeared - out and renormalized continuum versions of random fields on a lattice .",
    "the mathematical meaning of these objects is not completely clarified , but the focus is instead on the algebraic structure of  local operators \" which act on and are identified with the fields .",
    "the main assumption of the theory is that the operators ( or fields ) behave nicely under  conformal transformations . \"",
    "the operators related to the so - called stress - energy tensor ( defined as the local response of the action in the functional integral ) play a special role in generating a virasoro algebra representation whose central charge @xmath0 is the fundamental characteristic of a critical model .",
    "belavin , polyakov , and zamolodchikov showed that in the case of degenerate representations , the correlation functions satisfy a special type of linear differential equations .",
    "finally they defined a class of conformal theories (  minimal models \" ) which describe and  solve \" ( in a physically accepted sense ) discrete critical models such as ising , potts , etc .",
    "the paper  @xcite had a great influence on the developments of conformal field theory .",
    "the operator formalism , which does not depend on a specific ( e.g. , statistical ) nature of the underlying fields , has been applied to a variety of other physical problems , see @xcite . in mathematics ,",
    "the study of abstract vertex algebras became an important part of modern representation theory @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a different approach to critical lattice models was proposed by schramm @xcite who introduced stochastic loewner evolution ( sle ) as the only possible candidates for the scaling limits of interface curves in several such models .",
    "his idea turned out to be very successful and led to the rigorous proof of some important conjectures in statistical physics , in particular some very non - trivial predictions of cft .",
    "the work of lawler - schramm - werner ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite ) and smirnov ( @xcite , @xcite ) exemplifies the remarkable achievements of complex analytic / probabilistic methods . in connection with their developments in the sle theory ,",
    "there has been some interest in interpreting the original cft arguments in ( less abstract ) terms of statistical models , and more generally in understanding the precise relation between cft and sle , see e.g. , @xcite and , on the physical side , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .    the goal of these mostly expository lectures is to give an elementary introduction to cft from the point of view of random or statistical fields .",
    "more precisely , we will describe an ( rather pedestrian ) implementation of cft in the specific case of statistical fields generated by certain non - random modification of the gaussian free field ( gff ) .",
    "gaussian free field is the simplest (  trivial \" ) example of euclidean field theory ; its mathematical aspects are well understood , see @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the gaussian free field that we will consider in these lectures are implicit in the work of schramm and sheffield @xcite and explicit in the physical paper @xcite .",
    "related ideas are certainly present in the much earlier papers by cardy @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we will only cover some starting points of the bpz theory : we will accurately define and explain such basic concepts as ward s identities , stress tensor , and vertex fields in terms of correlation functions of our random fields , but we will not reach the part of the theory concerning minimal models , and the only degeneracy we study will be of level two . in appendix",
    "[ appx : op algebra ] we will briefly explain the relation of our constructions to the operator algebra formalism by explicitly describing some form of the  operator - field correspondence . \" in the last two lectures we will discuss connections with the sle theory .",
    "it should be mentioned that we only consider the simplest conformal type of the theory  the case of a simply connected domain with a marked point on the boundary , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , and we only consider the gaussian free field with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "this conformal type of cft is relevant to the theory of chordal sle .",
    "the more traditional setting  cft in the full plane ( @xcite )  is somewhat more involved and will not be discussed here .",
    "many computations in these lectures are completely standard from the cft perspective  we include them for the sake of consistency and to make the exposition self - contained .",
    "we want to emphasize one more time that what we are considering is a very specific model of cft , and modern physical and algebraic theories go so much further . at the same time , we believe that this model is interesting in its own right , and its generalizations to more sophisticated conformal geometries may turn out to be quite non - trivial .",
    "we introduce a class of random fields defined in a simply connected domain @xmath1 in the complex plane .",
    "all our fields , which we call fock space fields , are constructed from the gaussian free field and its derivatives by means of wick s calculus .",
    "fock space fields may or may not be distributional random fields but their correlation functions are well - defined , and we can think of the fields as functions in @xmath1 whose values are correlation functionals .    later , in lecture [ ch : conf geom ] , we will revise the definition so that the fields will have certain geometric / conformal properties in the sense that their values will depend on local coordinates (  conformal fields \" ) .",
    "the functionals and fields that we consider in this first lecture are conformal fields expressed in the identity chart of @xmath2 in lecture [ ch : chiral ] we will further extend the concept to include some  multivalued \" ( chiral ) fields .    in the first two sections we recall some basic facts concerning the gaussian free field , its fock space , and wick s calculus , see @xcite and @xcite . in section  [ sec : corr fcnl ] and section  [ sec : f - field ] we define correlation functionals and fock space fields ( as functional - valued functions ) . in appendix",

    "the joint distribution of such a family is determined by the means and covariances of the random variables .",
