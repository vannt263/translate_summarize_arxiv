    "if one of @xmath245 or @xmath238 is in @xmath104 but the other is not , then we are in almost the same situation as the previous case except that we now need to add the other of @xmath245 or @xmath238 to the part containing the first and then further partition that part into two , one containing @xmath245 and the other containing @xmath238",

    "furthermore , the vertices involved in the partitions can only be endpoints of edges in @xmath264 , that is they must be vertices of the copy of @xmath91 for @xmath259 .",

    "the remaining graph is now @xmath266 . on the polynomial side ,",
    "each summand from the sum of products of spanning forest polynomials on @xmath263 has itself become a sum of products of spanning forest polynomials on @xmath266 and in both cases the vertices involves in the partitions must be in the appropriate copy of @xmath91 .",
    "we can do the same for any product of @xmath267 spanning forest polynomials on @xmath268 which involve only vertices of @xmath91 regardless of whether it appeared in the expansion of @xmath261 .",
    "@xmath91 is a finite graph and so has a finite number of vertices .",
    "so there are only a finite number of partitions of subsets of these vertices .",
    "so there are also only finitely many lists of @xmath262 such partitions .",
    "call this set of products of partitions @xmath269 .",
    "we can view any product of @xmath262 spanning forest polynomials on @xmath263 involving only vertices of @xmath91 as being such a list of partitions .",
    "therefore the map described in the previous paragraph which takes a product of @xmath262 spanning forest polynomials on @xmath263 to a sum of such products on @xmath266 is a map from @xmath269 to itself .",
    "this map is independent of @xmath51 for @xmath51 sufficiently large because of the recursive structure of the family .",
    "for @xmath270 , let @xmath271 correspond to the cardinality over @xmath272 of the variety defined by the vanishing of the product of spanning forest polynomials corresponding to @xmath155 at the level of @xmath263 . then the map described above gives a system of linear recurrences relating the @xmath271 with the @xmath273 .",
    "such a system is always solvable by standard finite techniques .",
    "the values for any finite number of small values of @xmath51 can be computed directly in a finite amount of time by counting edge assignments or by working directly with the variety .",
    "hence we can obtain the base cases for the recursion and deal with @xmath274 and any other @xmath51 which is too small .",
    "furthermore the particular linear combination of @xmath271 giving @xmath261 is also independent of @xmath51 for @xmath51 sufficiently large because of the recursive structure of the family .",
    "therefore , the solution to the system of linear recurrences gives an expression for @xmath261 for all @xmath51 .",
    "now suppose @xmath275 . for @xmath51",
    "sufficiently large , we can assign the edges of @xmath260 and also @xmath276 as needed to assign 3 to 5 edges .",
    "this case then follows from the above .",
    "non - skew toroidal grids are a large family of graphs for which we now know @xmath277 .",
    "previous families with @xmath278 were known by double triangle or by small edge or vertex cuts ( see @xcite ) , but none of these apply to the toroidal grids .",
    "other than the non - skew toroidal grid @xmath37 , we do not know if non - skew toroidal grids have @xmath279 for primes @xmath280 .",
    "either way would be interesting giving either a new family of weight drop graphs ( see @xcite for more on weight in this sense ) or giving a family of graphs with @xmath277 for reasons other than weight drop",
    ".    the @xmath281-ladder result hints at how some structure of higher weight drops may be visible to these techniques as the larger the ladder the more independent symmetries forced @xmath282 to be @xmath196 .",
