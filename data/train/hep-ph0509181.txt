    "high precision of modern high - energy experiments stimulates interest to two  loop calculations .",
    "these calculations , in comparison with one - loop calculations , are technically much more complicated .",
    "the tensor reduction and integration - by - parts ( ibp ) method @xcite effectively reduces the integral , corresponding to any multi - loop diagram , to the linear combination of the master integrals ( mis ) .",
    "the coefficients in this linear combination often have poles of some finite order at @xmath2 ( space - time dimension is @xmath3 ) .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to know the expansion of the master integrals in @xmath4 , at least , a few first terms of this expansion .",
    "successful method of calculating this expansion term - by - term is based on the application of the differential equations method @xcite .",
    "the results for two - loop diagrams are usually expressed in terms of ( generalized ) harmonic polylogarithms @xcite ( see , however , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . due to rapid increase of calculational complexity when increasing the order of expansion , the calculations using this method are typically done up to @xmath5 terms . however , it may be not sufficient for the calculation of some diagrams .",
    "therefore , it is highly desirable to calculate master integrals exactly in @xmath0 .",
    "one of the most powerful methods of such calculation is the application of mellin  barnes transformation @xcite .",
    "however , for the case of several external invariants and/or many internal lines this method becomes hard to apply .    in this paper",
    ", we present a method of obtaining the asymptotic expansion ( ae ) in inverse powers of some large scale @xmath6 of multi - loop master integrals exact in space ",
    "time dimension @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , this expansion has a finite radius of convergence which can be determined from ode theory , thus being a power series representation accessible for numerical calculations in definite kinematic region . as an application",
    ", we calculate series representations of two  loop diagram presented in fig.[marquee ] in two different kinematics .",
    "our result can be easily expanded in @xmath4 and the @xmath7 term reproduces the known result .",
    "we also present the algorithm allowing to calculate , term  by  term , the asymptotical expansion of the diagrams in fig.[diamond ] .",
    "our method can be described as follows . for the calculation of the master integrals of given topology",
    "we differentiate them with respect to @xmath6 , and express the result of differentiation ( with help of integration by parts @xcite ) in terms of mis of the same topology and its subtopologies .",
    "thus , we obtain , in general case , the linear system of first  order odes .",
    "we assume that the mis of subtopologies are already known by means of this method or some other .",
    "when the given topology has only one mi , @xmath8 , the system is reduced to one equation .",
    "the authors of papers @xcite also used the differential equations method and searched for the solution in the form of @xmath4expansion imposing the boundary condition at some finite point .",
    "unfortunately , the results obtained by the method proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite quickly become very cumbersome with increase of the order in @xmath4 .",
    "the original point of our approach is the choice of boundary conditions .",
    "we impose boundary condition by fixing a definite term of asymptotical expansion of @xmath8 , namely , the term proportional to the main asymptotics of the solution of the homogeneous part of the differential equation , @xmath9 . in the cases considered in this paper , choice @xmath10 ( @xmath3 ) allows to fix the boundary condition by calculation of the main asymptotics of @xmath8 .",
    "we calculate this asymptotics by means of standard techniques ( feynman parametrization , mellin  barnes representation , etc . ) . given the asymptotical expansion of inhomogeneous term , of @xmath9 , and boundary condition , we find the asymptotical expansion of @xmath8 . from the standard theory of ode it follows that obtained power series has a finite radius of convergence .",
    "our approach can be also used in the case of system of several equations . in this case , the additional obstacles connected with finding the homogeneous solution arise .",
    "however , we can find the ae of the homogeneous solution up to any finite order .",
    "the same is true for solution of initial inhomogeneous system .",
    "thus , using our approach , one can reduce the calculation of the ae ( having the form of covergent power series ) of master integral in @xmath0 dimensions to the calculation of its main asymptotics .",
    "the radius of convergence can be determined by the methods of ode theory .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we consider the case of one mi in the topology .",
    "we calculate the ae of the integrals corresponding to the vertex diagrams shown in fig.[marquee ] . in section 3",
    ", we describe the algorithm which allows to calculate the ae of mis in the case of system of differential equations . as an example , we consider the crossed ",
    "box topology with three mis depicted in fig.[diamond ] . in the conclusion ,",
    "we discuss the main results of the present paper .",
    "consider inhomogeneous differential equation for the mi @xmath8 with respect to external scale @xmath6 @xmath11 the solution of this equation is @xmath12 where @xmath13 $ ] is the solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation .",
    "in our approach we are interested in the asymptotical expansion for large @xmath6 and assume that it is already known for @xmath14 . then it is convenient to let @xmath15 tend to infinity : @xmath16 for mis considered in the present paper , the choice @xmath10 allows to calculate the limit @xmath17 separately in the first and the second terms in eq . . in this case",
    "we can integrate term - by - term the ae of the integrand in eq . .",
    "in this stage the problem of finding of the whole ae of @xmath8 is reduced to the calculation of its main asymptotics . in the more general case ,",
    "when the limits can not be taken separately , the problem is reduced to the calculation of few first terms of the asymptotics of @xmath8 .",
