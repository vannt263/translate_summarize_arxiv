    "<S> we consider , in the electroweak standard model context , several left - right asymmetries in @xmath0 elastic scattering at fixed target and collider experiments . for the former case , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the muon mass effects are important in a wide energy range . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that these asymmetries are sensitive to the electroweak mixing angle @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of an extra @xmath2 neutral vector boson appearing in a 331 model is also considered . </S>",
    "<S> the capabilities of these asymmetries in the search of this extra @xmath2 are addressed .    </S>",
    "<S> several years ago derman and marciano  @xcite considered briefly the left - right asymmetry in @xmath3 , here denoted by @xmath4 , with unpolarized muon scattering on polarized electron target . according to them this asymmetry can be measured and the only difference between the high energy @xmath5 scattering and the high energy @xmath6 scattering is that in the former we must omit crossed amplitudes . with the attention received by muon colliders nowadays this issue become important  @xcite . beside , it has been shown that the mass effect of the muon can not be neglected in muon - muon scattering  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show that at the born approximation and in the context of the electroweak standard model there are appreciable effects coming from the mass of the muon .    some advantage to measure @xmath4 </S>",
    "<S> were commented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the first is that muon beams generally have energies at least one order of magnitude greater than the electron beams . </S>",
    "<S> thus experimentally , since the left - right asymmetry in @xmath7 and in @xmath0 are proportional to @xmath8 , a larger value for the asymmetry in the later case can be obtained . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , in @xmath9 scattering the background contribution from @xmath10 scattering is less severe because one could trigger on a single scattered electron which could not have arisen from a @xmath11 collision . </S>",
    "<S> the problem arisen by derman and marciano was that the experiment requires strictly zero muon polarization , otherwise the purely qed spin - spin effect would totally mask @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> however we will show below that this happens only for low values of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> this problem does not exist in a muon - electron fixed target experiment using the high - energy muon beam m2 of the cern sps as in the na47 experiment  @xcite . in this case left- and right - handed polarized muon </S>",
    "<S> can be scattered off unpolarized electron ( see below ) .    here </S>",
    "<S> we will calculate the @xmath4 asymmetry taking into account the muon mass but neglecting the electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> recently , @xmath13 purely qed spin - spin effect calculations ( with both particles polarized ) have been done in these conditions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the fact is that at na47 typical energies the muon energy is @xmath14 gev , _ </S>",
    "<S> i. e. _ , the invariant @xmath8 is only 20 times bigger than the muon mass squared and the effects of the muon mass can not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> hence , future electroweak radiative corrections to the @xmath4 asymmetry probably will have to take into account the muon mass also .    </S>",
    "<S> the left - right asymmetry with one of the particle being unpolarized is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the differential cross section for one right ( left)-handed lepton @xmath17 scattering on an unpolarized lepton @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> that is @xmath19 where @xmath20 denotes the cross section for incoming leptons with helicity @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , and they are given by @xmath23 notice that since the @xmath0 scattering is non - diagonal @xmath24 , so the asymmetry in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ asy2 ] ) is different from the asymmetry defined as @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> .    we will consider the process @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the transferred momentum . as we said before </S>",
    "<S> , we will neglect the electron mass but not the muon mass _ i.e. _ , @xmath28 for the electron and @xmath29 for the muon . </S>",
    "<S> in the non - diagonal elastic scattering in the standard model we have only the @xmath30-channel contribution . </S>",
    "<S> the relevant amplitudes are in appendix  [ sec : aa ] and in the appendices of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we will study here @xmath4 defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ asy2 ] ) in the context of two models : the electroweak standard model ( esm ) and in a model having a doubly charged bilepton vector field ( @xmath31 ) and an extra neutral vector boson @xmath2  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the latter model has also two doubly charged scalar bileptons but since their contributions cancel out in the numerator of the asymmetry we will not consider them . </S>",
    "<S> we identify the case under study by using the @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 labels in cross sections and asymmetries .    </S>",
    "<S> first , we will consider the @xmath0 elastic scattering in the context of the electroweak standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath35 asymmetry for @xmath36 and fixed target experiments is @xmath37 which is the expression obtained by derman and marciano  @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will not shown explicitly the @xmath35 expression for @xmath38 . for @xmath39 , </S>",
    "<S> the above asymmetry is @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> although it is a rather small value the cross section still depends on @xmath41 implying a large cross section which can allow to have enough statistics as in the case of @xmath7 scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ab1 ] ) we obtain a total cross section of @xmath42 mb for @xmath43 gev . </S>",
    "<S> ( in appendix  [ sec : ab ] we shown the differential cross section for @xmath0 scattering in the laboratory frame . )    from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ asydm ] ) and @xmath39 , we get @xmath44 for @xmath45 gev ( or @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 for @xmath14 gev ( or @xmath48 ) . taking into account the muon mass we get for the same conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> form fig .  1 and the illustrative values given above we see that for fixed target experiments the muon - mass effects can not be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , taking into account the muon - mass effects in @xmath51 will be crucial to correctly interpret the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> this is due to the high sensitivity of @xmath51 with the electroweak mixing angle as it can be seen in fig .  2 . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , for @xmath52 gev a 0.5% change in the @xmath51 value corresponds to a 0.04% change in @xmath53 , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ , a change from @xmath54 to @xmath55 .    in the na47 experiment </S>",
    "<S> the beam polarization was determined by measuring the cross - section asymmetry for the scattering of polarized muons on polarized atomic electrons . </S>",
    "<S> since the elastic cross section for fixed target experiments is large ( @xmath56 ) mb may be it is possible to extract information about the @xmath57 asymmetry with unpolarized electrons . </S>",
    "<S> this parameter is dominated by weak effects .    for collider experiments </S>",
    "<S> , that would be feasible if the muon - electron collider is constructed , we have that the asymmetry is large when comparing with the corresponding for fixed target experiments . </S>",
    "<S> for instance @xmath58 for @xmath14 gev ( @xmath59 gev ) and @xmath39 , as can be seen from fig .  3 . </S>",
    "<S> we show only one curve in fig .  3 because mass effects are not important in high - energy colliders . </S>",
    "<S> we have also verified that @xmath60 is as sensitive as @xmath61 to the value of @xmath53 . however , for statistical purposes we have to observe that the cross section for colliders is considerably smaller than that of fixed target experiments : @xmath62 nb for @xmath59 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting possibility is the case when both leptons are polarized . </S>",
    "<S> we can define an asymmetry @xmath63 in which one beam is always in the same polarization state , say right - handed , and the other is either right- or left - handed polarized ( similarly we can define @xmath64 ) : @xmath65    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 4 we show the asymmetry @xmath66 as a function of @xmath67 and we note that the muon  mass effects are relevant for a wide range of @xmath68-values . for @xmath39 and @xmath14 gev </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath69 while for the same condition the purely qed contribution gives @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we see that like in the electron - electron mller scattering this asymmetry is sensitive to the neutral vector contributions . </S>",
    "<S> this is interesting since this asymmetry , as we said before , can already be measured in experiments like the na47 at cern showing that it could be useful for doing electroweak studies also . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , this experiment has already measured the asymmetry for polarized muon - electron scattering expected in qed : the cross section asymmetry for antiparallel ( @xmath71 ) and parallel ( @xmath72 )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds in our notation to the asymmetry @xmath73 we have confirmed the value obtained by the smc collaboration for this asymmetry _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. , _ it ranges from 0.01 to 0.05 for low values of @xmath68 ( @xmath74 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath63 ( @xmath75 ) is not interesting for colliders experiments since it gives @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) due to the fact that @xmath78 ( @xmath79 ) largely dominates in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ar ] )    we have also investigated the effect of a doubly charged bilepton vector boson . in some models with vector bileptons like @xmath80 the decay @xmath81 ( and similar ones ) does occur . </S>",
    "<S> the branching ratio for this decay is @xmath82  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this bound strongly limits the @xmath83 couplings . </S>",
    "<S> the branching fraction for @xmath84 decay is @xmath85 for the case @xmath86 gev and @xmath87 the experimental value for the above branching ratio implies @xmath88 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we see that with such a large suppression the @xmath89-amplitudes given in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ua ] ) are negligible . however </S>",
    "<S> , since we do not know if the @xmath89-vector doubly charged bilepton ( if it exists ) prefers to couple in an almost diagonal way to charged leptons we are free to consider also the case @xmath90 and @xmath91 . in the first case </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath89-contributions to cross section and asymmetry are negligible and the asymmetry is the same as in the esm : @xmath92 for @xmath14 gev ( @xmath93 gev ) . in the second case </S>",
    "<S> we have @xmath94 for the same experimental conditions . </S>",
    "<S> in the following we will assume that we are in the first case and so we will not consider the @xmath89-contribution to the asymmetry .    in the model </S>",
    "<S> there is also a @xmath2 neutral vector boson which couples with the leptons as follows @xmath95\\,z'_\\mu , \\label{zpnc}\\ ] ] with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath30-channel @xmath2-exchange amplitudes are similar to those of the esm @xmath98 given in the appendix a2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite but now with the couplings @xmath99 s and @xmath100 s given in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zpnc ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the @xmath2 contributions the @xmath4 asymmetry is considerably enhanced as showed in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 5 . </S>",
    "<S> we see from fig .  5 that the measurement of the @xmath101 asymmetry will be appropriate for searching extra neutral vector bosons with a mass up to 1 tev . since in the 331 model </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2 couplings with the leptons are flavor conserving we do not have additional suppression factors coming from mixing . </S>",
    "<S> hence the non - diagonal mller scattering ( @xmath0 ) can be very helpful , even with the present experimental capabilities , for looking for non - standard physics effects . </S>",
    "<S> we will not consider the @xmath2 contributions to the @xmath35 and @xmath63 asymmetries in fixed target experiments because they are very small .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we would like to stress that other related processes like @xmath102 and @xmath103 deserve a detailed study . </S>",
    "<S> in particular the @xmath102 collision is interesting , as it was pointed out by hou  @xcite , because of its connection with @xmath104 conversion ( @xmath105 denote the muonium atom ) . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of resonance production involving lepton flavor violating couplings with hypothetical particles ( like doubly charged scalar or vector bileptons , flavor changing neutral scalar bosons ) at a @xmath0 collider have been considered in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , barger _ </S>",
    "<S> et al . </S>",
    "<S> , _ have shown that the resonance production of the known particles puts severe limits on the respective cross section  @xcite .    </S>",
