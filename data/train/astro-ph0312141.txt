    "recent x - ray observations have confirmed that collimated jets can be found emanating from pulsar engines ( weisskopf et al .",

    "these jets morphologically resemble those of young stellar objects ( reipurth & bally 2001 ) , planetary nebulae , ( balick & frank 2002 ) active galactic nuclei ( ferrari 1998 ) and microquasars ( mirabel 2001 ) . jets and disks",
    "are likely associated in these systems , even if the role of the disk vs. central object is not fully understood with respect to jet production . here",
    "we explore the possibility that there may also be disks around jetted pulsars , and that winds from these disks might collimate the pulsar wind .",
    "the motivation is that relativistic pulsar winds do not seem to self - collimate easily ( e.g. lyubarsky & eichler 2001 ; bogovalov & khangoulian 2003 ; komissarov & lyubarsky 2003 ) : strong outward electric forces compete with the self - collimating collimating hoop stresses .",
    "tsinganos & bogovalov ( 2002 ) simulated the generic efficacy of relativistic wind collimation by an ambient non - relativistic wind , but did not dynamically relate the external wind to the properties of an underlying disk .",
    "michel & dessler ( 1981 ) suggested that disks formed from the stellar collapse offer a physical similarity between radio and x - ray pulsars .",
    "such disks can also influence pulsar braking indices and timing ages : the former often deviate from those expected if spin - down were due only to dipole radiation , and the latter often differ from inferred actual ages .",
    "various intrinsic mechanisms for these deviations have been proposed ( macy 1974 ; manchester & taylor 1977 ; chanmugam & sang 1989 ; beskin et al .",
    "( 1993 ) ; chubarian et al .",

    "this would imply a weaker pulsar magnetic field than that inferred from the measured period @xmath0 and its derivative @xmath1 .",
    "this has been confirmed for one neutron star where the magnetic field was measured from cyclotron lines ( bignami et al .",
    "2003 ) .    here",
    "we calculate the effect of a wind - emitting accretion disk on the pulsar spin evolution by coupling the latter to evolution equations for accretion and radius dependent mass loss .",
    "we constrain the pulsar magnetic field strength and the initial outer accretion rate ( or disk mass ) for which the solutions match the observed periods , timing ages , and braking indices of crab and vela .",
    "the resulting solutions produce sufficient disk - wind momenta to potentially collimate and help illuminate the pulsar winds .",
    "we describe our wind and accretion parameterization in section 2 . in sec .",
    "3 we show that the launch mechanism determines the radial dependence of the mass outflow rate . in sec .",
    "4 we calculate the spin evolution of the pulsar and find best fit solutions for crab and vela .",
    "we compare the pulsar and disk - wind momenta in sec . 5 , and conclude in sec . 6 .",
    "given the accretion rate at the outer disk radius @xmath2 , the time - dependent mass loss from a disk - wind launched between radii @xmath3 and @xmath4 from the pulsar can be parameterized as _",

    "the disk is allowed to penetrate the magnetosphere up to the magnetospheric radius @xmath8 ( @xmath9 g is the pulsar s magnetic field and @xmath10 its mass ) where the torque exerted by the magnetic field on the disk is of order the viscous torque .    to constrain @xmath11 , we appeal to previous work .",
    "chevalier ( 1989 ) studied fallback accretion , but without angular momentum .",
    "here we adopt the menou et al .",
    "( 2001a ; see also chatterjee et al .",

    "cannizzo et al .",
    "( 1990 ) showed that there is a transient spreading phase of duration @xmath12 during which the accretion is nearly constant , @xmath13 but after which the accretion rate declines as a power - law with time , @xmath14^{-\\delta}$ ] , and the initial accretion rate depends linearly on the product of the viscosity parameter @xmath15 ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) and the initial mass of the disk .",
    "they also found that @xmath16 provides a good fit to the late time evolution and that the outer edge of the disk then evolves as @xmath17 .",
    "the initial @xmath18 is determined by the angular momentum of the presupernova star and the amount of ejected material .",

    "we can also write the total mechanical disk - wind luminosity as l_dw(t ) = 12 _ r_in^r_out ddr ( _ dw(r , t ) v_dw^2 ) dr [ eq : lwind ] where @xmath23 is the escape speed at the inner radius , and the last step holds when the total mass inside radius @xmath24 satisfies @xmath25 .",
    "note that the initial total disk mass is @xmath26 , so our equations could be scaled in terms of this quantity .",
    "for magnetically mediated outflows ( e.g. spruit 1996 ) , the mechanical wind luminosity is powered by poynting flux from large scale fields .",

[ 12 ] the last equation follows from the expression for @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and defining @xmath44 and @xmath45 . we can set ( [ 12 ] ) equal to ( [ eq : lwind ] ) , to obtain ( 1-p)(_o^p-1 ) = ( 1-p)(v_escv_dw)^2 ^1/2_ss2 ^_o_1^p-2d= ( v_escv_dw)^2 _ ss^1/22(1-_0^p-1 ) .",

    "( [ 13 ] ) shows that @xmath27 is not independent of @xmath46 and @xmath15 once a launch mechanism is chosen .",
    "the above formalism involves the relation that the mechanical disk - wind luminosity at a given radius is a constant fraction of the accretion luminosity , so ref ( [ 12 ] ) implies that both @xmath47 and the accretion luminosity increase with decreasing @xmath27 if all other quantities were fixed .",
    "this formalism breaks down when the value of @xmath27 is so low that @xmath48 .",
    "the pulsar dipole luminosity for a neutron star of angular speed @xmath49 and radius @xmath50 is given by l_pul(t ) , [ eq : lpuls ] where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 is the angle between the magnetic and spin axes .",

    "this was studied by beskin et al .",

    "the rotational energy evolution is determined by this dipole radiation and a model dependent accretion torque so that = i = - ^4 + 2_inr_m^2_k(r_m)^ , [ eq : spindown ] where @xmath54 is the moment of inertia of the star , @xmath55 , and we use a @xmath56 model .",
    "we also define the braking index and timing age as @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively .",
    "we determine the spin evolution of the star by numerically solving eq .",
    "( [ eq : spindown ] ) combined with the equations in section 2 . to do so",
    ", we also need the pulsar s magnetic field , the initial spin period , and the initial accretion rate in the disk .",
    "if the star were spinning down only by dipole radiation , then its magnetic field would be directly determined from measuring @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "but when a disk torque contributes to the spin - down , we only know that the magnetic field strength must be smaller than the value obtained for a pure dipole . for young pulsars",
    ", we expect @xmath59 g. the initial spin period @xmath60 is also uncertain , but typically , @xmath61 msec .",
    "the initial accretion rate is likewise unknown .",
    "to constrain these parameters in our model , we use observational values of the period , timing age and braking index for the specific pulsar under consideration .",
    "we then solve the coupled system of equations using a grid of values for @xmath60 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 to obtain a best fit parameter range that reproduces the observed values of @xmath0 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 to within a few percent .",
    "we specifically consider the crab and vela pulsars . in 1972 ,",
    "the crab s true age was 918 yr , and its measured timing age was @xmath66  yr , while the braking index was @xmath67 with period @xmath68 ms .",

    ". the values of @xmath86 in our formal solutions , like those in accretion models of gamma - ray bursts , are highly super - eddington .",

    "pavlov et al . ( 2003 ) estimated an energy injection rate @xmath88 g / s for the vela jet . in all of our solutions ,",
    "the corotation radius is less than the magnetospheric radius at all times , so the pulsars are always spun down by the disk .",
    "the precise value of @xmath27 is not crucial to obtain a good solution for @xmath0 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 ; what matters for the spin - down torque is the value of @xmath89 , and a different @xmath27 can be compensated with a different @xmath90 to yield a similar @xmath89 ( and hence a similar evolutionary track ) .",
    "this is why the two lines in the top three panels of fig.1 overlap .",
    "note that the higher @xmath27 curves for @xmath47 are @xmath91 the lower @xmath27 curves because @xmath2 is larger for the larger @xmath27 cases , and this counteracts the dependence of @xmath47 on @xmath27 discussed below eq .",

    "the predicted optical emission from a even a face - on thin disk would be below the optical detection ( sollerman 2003 ) .",
    "for vela , the observed optical flux limits require either ( i ) a disk almost edge - on to the line of sight ( ii ) disruption of the outer parts of the disk ( maybe through interaction with the supernova remnant ) or ( iii ) a geometrically thick and optically thin disk , like an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) ( e.g. esin et al .",
    "relativistic poynting flux pulsar winds do not easily self - collimate ( e.g. lyubarsky & eichler 2001 ) ; as strong outward electric forces compete with the collimating magnetic hoop stress .",
    "( this problem would not arise in non - relativistic outflows , as the electric field @xmath98 magnetic field . )",
    "we suggest instead that pulsar jets may be collimated by a surrounding disk wind .",
    "a necessary condition for the disk wind to collimate the pulsar wind is that the ram pressure associated with the disk wind exceed the magnetic pressure associated with the poynting flux dominated pulsar wind on scales at or less than those where the collimation is observed .",
    "since the jets appear on scales @xmath99 than that of the disk , it is reasonable to make this comparison far outside the pulsar s light cylinder .",
    "magnetic energy dominates the particle energy in the pulsar wind , so the energy outflow rate can be estimated as @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is a spherical radius . comparing the two pressures amounts to comparing @xmath102 to @xmath103 .",
    "but @xmath104 , so this amounts to comparing @xmath105 with @xmath106 , namely comparing the rate of change of the disk - wind momentum to that of the pulsar wind .",
    "2 shows precisely this comparison for crab and vela .",
    "the solutions indicate that a collimating influence of the disk - wind on the pulsar wind is possible for the @xmath73 case for both pulsars . that @xmath73 provides higher disk - wind momenta and higher @xmath107 than @xmath74 results because the @xmath2 which best fits the spin parameters is larger for the large @xmath27 cases .",
    "( for the same @xmath2 , the large @xmath27 case would have a lower @xmath47 and momentum than the low @xmath27 case , as discussed below eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) . )",
    "although this effect dominates , a competing effect is that @xmath108 increases with decreasing @xmath27 : for both pulsars , eq .",
    "( [ 13 ] ) for @xmath109 reveals that @xmath73 and @xmath74 correspond to @xmath110 and @xmath111 respectively .",
    "collimation also requires that the vector sum of the pulsar wind and disk wind momenta incurs a significant vertical component .",
    "even if the disk wind were spherical , when its ram pressure exceeds that of the pulsar wind the pulsar wind would incur some collimation .",
    "however , since the disk wind is largely non - relativistic , magnetic self - collimation of the disk wind is not as problematic as that of the pulsar wind .",
    "self - collimation of the disk wind would favor even more collimation of the pulsar wind . a more detailed model of the interacting outflows",
    "is required to further develop these ideas .",
    "note that tsinganos & bogovalov ( 2002 ) have found numerically that relativistic central outflows could in principle be collimated by non - relativistic disk winds , also motivating more detailed models .",
    "a standard limitation of such numerical calculations is the assumption of the disk field geometry as a given initial condition .    at the interface of the two winds ,",
    "significant dissipation can occur , and accelerated particles can produce the observed radiation .",
    "in addition , bending of the collimated jet could result from mutual non - axisymmetry of coaxial winds , or from misaligned pulsar and disk wind symmetry axes .",
    "pavlov et al . ( 2003 ) suggested that a hidden wind from within the supernova remnant is needed to account for vela s bent jet .",
    "winds from fallback accretion disks below presently detectable limits may deposit enough momenta to collimate and bend the crab and vela pulsar winds and account for their observed jets .",
    "these disks can also account for the observed periods , braking indices , and timing ages of the crab and vela pulsars through the action of the disk torque on pulsar spin - down .",
    "our results motivate further efforts to detect disks around jetted pulsars , and more detailed models of the nested interacting winds . collimating a relativistic central wind by a surrounding accretion disk - wind",
