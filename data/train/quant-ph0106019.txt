    "bit commitment(bc ) is a cryptographic primitive involving two mistrustful parties , alice and bob , wherein one seeks to have alice submit an encoded bit of information to bob in such a way that bob can not reliably identify the bit before alice decodes it for him , and alice can not reliably change the bit after she has submitted it . in other words , bob is interested in binding alice to some commitment , and alice is interested in concealing this commitment from bob .",
    "it is well known @xcite that a bc protocol that is both concealing and binding is impossible @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it _ is _ possible to devise a bc protocol that is both _ partially _ concealing and _ partially _ binding , that is , one wherein if alice is honest then the probability that bob can estimate her commitment correctly is strictly less than 1 , and if bob is honest then the probability that alice can unveil whatever bit she desires is strictly less than 1 .",
    "this paper addresses the problem of determining the _ optimal _ degrees of concealment and bindingness that can be achieved simultaneously in quantum bit commitment protocols .",
    "we establish an upper bound on the degrees of concealment and bindingness for all bc protocols .",
    "it is unclear at this time whether or not this upper bound can be saturated .",
    "nonetheless , we _ are _ able to provide a saturable upper bound for a more restricted class of bc protocols , namely protocols wherein alice initially holds all of the systems that play a role in the commitment phase of the protocol . we also introduce a new kind of bcprotocol that achieves this maximum .",
    "the protocol essentially consists of alice preparing two systems in an entangled state , submitting one system to bob at the commitment phase , and submitting the other system at the unveiling phase .",
    "we show that in such protocols the maximum achievable degree of bindingness is related in a simple way to the fidelity between the reduced density operators for the systems held by bob at the end of the commitment phase .",
    "bc appears as a primitive in the protocols of many different cryptographic tasks between mistrustful parties .",
    "as such , the kinds of security that can be achieved in bc has implications for the kinds of security that can be achieved in these other tasks . in this paper",
    "we consider only the implications of our results to the task of coin tossing @xcite .",
    "a bit commitment protocol involves three phases , which are called the commitment phase , the holding phase and the unveiling phase . during the commitment phase ,",
    "alice and bob engage in some number of rounds of communication , with at least one communication from alice to bob .",
    "the period after the end of the commitment phase and prior to the beginning of the unveiling phase is called the holding phase , and may be of arbitrary duration . during the unveiling phase , there is again some number of rounds of communication , with at least one communication from alice to bob . at the end of the unveiling phase , an honest bob performs a measurement that has three outcomes , labelled @xmath0,`@xmath1 ' and ` fail ' , corresponding respectively to alice unveiling a 0 , alice unveiling a 1 and alice being caught cheating .",
    "the protocol specifies the sequence of actions an honest alice performs in order to commit to a bit @xmath2 , and guarantees that if she follows the actions for committing a bit @xmath2 then an honest bob s measurement at the end of the unveiling phase yields the outcome @xmath2 with certainty .    to discuss the security of bc protocols",
    ", it is useful to introduce two quantities which we shall call alice s _ control _ and bob s _ information gain_. these quantities are defined under the assumption that the other party is honest , and depend on the sequence of actions performed by the party in question .",
    "alice s control is meant to quantify the extent to which she can influence ( after the commitment phase ) the outcome of bob s measurement beyond what she could accomplish by following the honest strategy .",
    "bob s information gain is meant to quantify his ability to estimate alice s commitment ( prior to the unveiling phase ) beyond what he could accomplish by following the honest strategy .",
    "we now present the specific measures of control and information gain which we make use of in this paper .",
    "we assume for simplicity that bob has no prior information on which bit alice has committed , and that alice is as likely to wish to unveil a bit @xmath3 as she is to wish to unveil a bit @xmath1 .",
    "we take our measure of bob s information gain for the strategy @xmath4",
    "which we denote by @xmath5 to be the difference between his probability of estimating alice s commitment correctly when he implements @xmath6 and when he is honest , @xmath7 we take our measure of alice s control for the strategy @xmath8 which we denote by @xmath9 to be the difference between her probability of unveiling whatever bit she desires when she implements @xmath10 and when she is honest , @xmath11 it follows that @xmath12 and @xmath13 vary between @xmath3 and @xmath14    we quantify the degrees of concealment and bindingness in a bc protocol by bob s maximum information gain and alice s maximum control@xmath15 defined respectively by @xmath16 a protocol is said to be _ partially concealing _ if bob s maximum information gain is strictly less than complete information gain , @xmath17 it is said to be _ perfectly concealing _ if his information gain is zero , @xmath18 finally , it is said to be _ arbitrarily concealing _ or simply _ concealing _ if his information gain can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the value of a security parameter @xmath19 , that is , @xmath20 , where @xmath21 as @xmath22@xcite@xmath23 similar definitions hold for the degrees of security against alice .",
    "a protocol is said to be _ partially binding _ if alice s maximal control is strictly less than complete control , @xmath24 it is said to be _ perfectly binding _ if her control is zero , @xmath25 finally , it is said to be _ arbitrarily binding _ or simply _ binding _ if her control can be made arbitrarily small by increasing the value of a security parameter @xmath19 , that is , @xmath26 , where @xmath27 as @xmath28    if a degree of security ( such as concealment or bindingness ) can be guaranteed by assuming only the laws of physics ( and the integrity of a party s laboratory ) , then it is said to hold _ unconditionally .",
    "_ in this paper , we shall only be concerned with unconditional security .",
    "thus , every time we assign some degree of security ( such as concealment or bindingness ) to a protocol , it is implied that the protocol has this feature unconditionally .    to understand the degree to which a protocol can be made concealing or binding",
    "we must answer the following questions :    * what is bob s maximal information gain , and what strategy achieves this maximum ?",
    "that is , find @xmath29 and find @xmath30 such that @xmath31 * what is alice s maximal control , and what strategy achieves this maximum ? that is ,",
    "find @xmath32 and find @xmath33 such that @xmath34    in another paper@xcite , we provide answers to these questions for bc  protocols that are generalizations of the bb84 bc protocol@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we provide the complete solution for a different type of bc protocol , which we call a _ purification _ bc protocol .",
    "the above questions involve an optimization over strategies",
    ". we will also be interested in optimizing over protocols .",
    "specifically , we wish to answer the following question :    * for a given class of protocols , what is the _ minimum _ alice s maximum control can be made for a given value of bob s maximum information gain , and which protocol in the class achieves this minimum ?",
    "in other words , denoting protocols by @xmath35 , the given class of protocols by @xmath36 and the subset of this class associated with @xmath37 by @xmath38 find @xmath39 and find @xmath40 such that @xmath41 .",
    "if this question can be answered for every value of @xmath42 then one obtains a curve in the @xmath37-@xmath43 plane .",
    "moreover , if this curve is monotonically decreasing then it is identical to what would have been obtained by minimizing bob s maximum information gain for a given value of alice s maximum control . in this case",
    ", we call the curve the _ optimal trade - off relation _ between @xmath43 and @xmath37 . specifying this relation for a given class of protocols is a convenient way of expressing the maximum degrees of concealment and bindingness that can be achieved with such protocols .    in this paper , we determine a lower bound on the optimal trade - off relation between @xmath43 and @xmath37 for all bc  protocols .",
    "unfortunately , we have not determined whether this lower bound is saturable or not .",
    "however , we do find the optimal trade - off relation for a restricted class of bc protocols , which we call _",
    "alice - supplied _ bc  protocols .",
    "the generalized bb84 bc protocols and the purification bc protocols mentioned above both fall into this class . in fact , we show that the purification bc protocols are optimal within this class .",
    "these protocols will be defined precisely in the next section .",
    "in order to perform optimizations over all quantum bc protocols , it is necessary to have a completely general model of such protocols .",
    "we make use of the following model for cryptographic protocols implemented between two mistrustful parties@xcite .",
    "the hilbert space required to describe the protocol is the tensor product of the hilbert spaces for all the systems that play a role in the protocol .",
    "every action taken by a party in their laboratory corresponds to that party performing a unitary operation on the systems in their possession .",
    "every communication corresponds to a party sending some subset of the systems in their possession to the other party ( it follows that the mere transmission of information from one party to the other does not change the quantum state of the total system , but does change the hilbert space upon which the parties can implement their unitary operations ) .",
    "it is assumed that the total system is initially in a pure state@xmath23    it has been previously argued@xcite that this model is completely general .",
    "it incorporates the possibility of random choices and measurements during the protocol , since these can always be kept at the quantum level until the end without any loss of generality .",
    "a random choice is performed at the quantum level by implementing a unitary transformation that is conditioned upon the state of an ancilla prepared initially in a superposition of states .",
    "measurements are performed at the quantum level by unitarily coupling the system to be measured to an ancilla that is prepared in some fixed initial pure state .    in the case of bc",
    ", the most general protocol may involve many rounds of communication during the commitment phase .",
    "denoting the number of rounds by @xmath44 denoting alice s honest sequence of operations for committing a bit @xmath2 by @xmath45 and denoting bob s honest sequence of operations by @xmath46 the total unitary operation they jointly implement is @xmath47 the transmissions that occur in each round will determine the hilbert space over which @xmath48 and @xmath49 act non - trivially .",
    "thus , despite the fact that we have assumed that alice implements the first unitary operation , this operation could be trivial and it remains arbitrary which party is first to submit a sytem to the other party .",
    "if the initial state of all systems is denoted by @xmath50 then the state at the holding phase if both parties are honest is @xmath51 it follows that the reduced density operator for bob s system at the holding phase , assuming both parties are honest , is @xmath52 where the trace is over all the systems that end up in alice s possession at the holding phase .    during the unveiling phase ,",
    "a similar process occurs .",
    "denoting the number of rounds by @xmath53 denoting alice s honest sequence of operations given that she committed to bit @xmath2 by @xmath54 and denoting bob s honest sequence of operations by @xmath55 the total unitary operation they jointly implement is @xmath56 thus , if both parties are honest , the state of the total system at the end of the unveiling phase is @xmath57 the protocol ends with bob performing a three - outcome projective measurement @xmath58 on the systems in his possession .",
    "if both parties are honest , then whenever alice commits to a bit @xmath59 the measurement must have outcome @xmath2 with probability @xmath60 this implies that @xmath61 and @xmath62 must be orthogonal , @xmath63 and that @xmath64 must be an eigenstate of @xmath65 with eigenvalue @xmath66@xmath67    as mentioned earlier , we will be interested in a restricted class of bc protocols , which we call _ alice - supplied _ bc protocols_. _ these protocols impose no restrictions on the details of the unveiling phase and may involve an arbitrary number of rounds of communication between alice and bob during the commitment phase .",
    "however , it is required that _ all _ of the systems that bob makes use of during the commitment phase are supplied by alice .",
    "the class of alice - supplied bc protocols includes the generalized bb84 bc protocols , defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , as well as the purification bc protocols defined below .",
    "an example of a protocol that falls _ outside _ this class is one wherein at the beginning of the commitment phase bob submits to alice a system that is entangled with one he keeps in his possession , and alice encodes her commitment in the unitary transformation she performs upon this system before resubmitting it to bob .",
    "another example of such a protocol is one wherein during the commitment phase bob uses ancillas that alice did not supply in order to make a random choice or perform a measurement .",
    "we now provide a precise definition of a purification bc protocol .    * a purification bc protocol .",
    "* such a protocol makes use of just two systems , which we shall call the token system and the proof system ( since one is the token of alice s commitment and the other is the proof of her commitment ) .",
    "these are associated with hilbert spaces @xmath68 and @xmath69 a purification bc protocol also specifies two orthogonal states @xmath70 and @xmath71 defined on @xmath72 .",
    "the honest actions are as follows .    1 .   at the commitment phase",
    ", alice prepares the two systems in the state @xmath73 in order to commit to bit @xmath59 and sends the token system to bob .",
    "2 .   at the unveiling phase",
    ", alice sends the proof system to bob , and bob performs a measurement of the projector - valued measure @xmath74 where @xmath75    so we see there is only a single communication from alice to bob during both the commitment and the unveiling phases . in the notation of the general model presented above , @xmath76 transforms @xmath77 to @xmath78 and @xmath79 so that @xmath80    we call this a purification bc protocol , since at the unveiling phase an honest alice is required to provide bob with a purification of the state that he received from her during the commitment phase .",
    "two measures of the distinguishability of density operators will be important in the present work : the trace distance and the fidelity , defined respectively by@xcite @xmath81 and @xmath82 where @xmath83 .",
    "we will find the following relations between these two measures to be very useful .",
    "for any two density operators , the fidelity and the trace distance satisfy@xcite @xmath84 and @xmath85 the second inequality is saturated for any pair of pure states , that is , @xmath86 for all @xmath87 and @xmath88 a stronger lower bound for the trace distance between @xmath89 and @xmath90 exists if one of the density operators is pure .",
    "specifically , @xmath91 this stronger lower bound also applies to the mixed states of qubits .",
    "more precisely , we have the following result .",
    "lemma 1 : :    for pairs of density operators @xmath92    @xmath90 whose supports lie in a single 2-dimensional    hilbert space ,    @xmath93    the proof of this is presented in the appendix . all of the above inequalities can be saturated .",
    "explicit examples will be presented in section vi .",
    "finally , we present some properties of the fidelity that will be useful for the present investigation . uhlmann s",
    "theorem@xcite states that the fidelity between two density operators is equal to the overlap of two maximally parallel purifications of these density operators .",
    "thus , if @xmath89 and @xmath90 are density operators on a hilbert space @xmath94 @xmath95 and @xmath96 are arbitrary purifications of @xmath89 and @xmath90 on @xmath97 and @xmath98 is a unitary transformation on @xmath99 then @xmath100    another critical property is given by the following lemma .",
    "lemma 2 : :    the fidelity satisfies    @xmath101    the proof of this can be found in the derivation of eq.([pumax4 ] ) from eq.([pumax3 ] ) in section vi and by making use of uhlmann s theorem .",
    "in this section , we demonstrate an upper bound on the simultaneous degrees of concealment and bindingness ( hence a _ lower _ bound on @xmath37 and @xmath43 ) for _ any _ bc protocol .",
    "it should be noted that the main ideas that go into the proof of this result are present in the work of mayers@xcite and lo and chau@xcite .",
    "theorem 1 : :    in any bc protocol , @xmath102    * proof*. we begin by proving ( i ) . to analyze security against bob , we assume that alice is honest .",
    "suppose that bob uses a strategy wherein he acts honestly throughout the commitment phase . in this case",
    ", the state of the total system at the end of this phase will be @xmath103 or @xmath104 depending on alice s commitment .",
    "the reduced density operators for bob s system will be @xmath105 or @xmath106 now suppose that during the holding phase bob does the measurement which optimally discriminates between @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "it is a well - known result of state estimation theory@xcite that his information gain in this case will be @xmath109 bob s maximum information gain may be greater than this value , since it may be beneficial for him to also cheat during the commitment phase ( for instance , if the reduced density operators on bob s systems are more easily discriminated at some point during the commitment phase than they are at the holding phase ) . bob s maximum information gain can not , however , be less than this bound .",
    "this establishes ( i ) .    we now prove ( ii ) . to analyze security against alice",
    ", we can assume that bob is honest .",
    "suppose that alice uses the following strategy . during the commitment phase",
    ", she follows the honest protocol for committing a bit @xmath3 , so that the total system is in the state @xmath110 at the holding phase .",
    "thereafter , if alice wishes to unveil a bit @xmath111 she acts honestly for the rest of the protocol , while if she wishes to unveil a bit @xmath112 then she applies a unitary transformation @xmath113 to the systems in her possession just prior to the unveiling phase , and thereafter acts honestly .",
    "@xmath113 is chosen such that @xmath114 the probability that alice succeeds at unveiling a bit @xmath3 when she attempts to do so is unity , @xmath115 since she has simply followed the honest protocol for committing a @xmath116 the probability that alice succeeds at unveiling a bit @xmath1 when she attempts to do so is @xmath117 now since the state @xmath118 is an eigenstate of @xmath119 with eigenvalue 1 ( see eq.([conditionofcorrectness ] ) ) , one can write @xmath120 for some non - negative operator @xmath121 , orthogonal to @xmath122 it follows that @xmath123 since we are assuming that alice is equally likely to wish to unveil a @xmath3 as a @xmath66 her probability of unveiling the bit of her choosing satisfies @xmath124 recalling the definition of @xmath113 ( eq.([defineu ] ) ) , and making use of uhlmann s theorem ( eq.([uhlmann ] ) ) , we conclude that alice s control for this particular strategy satisfies @xmath125 alice s maximum control may be greater than this bound , since she may be able to cheat during the commitment and unveiling phases as well , but it can not be less . this establishes ( ii ) .",
    "@xmath126     and @xmath37 for _ any _ bc protocol .",
    "the other curves are the optimal trade - off relations for alice - supplied bc  under different restrictions on @xmath107 and @xmath127 : ( ii ) no restrictions ; ( iii ) both qubit states or not both mixed states ; and ( iv ) both pure states .",

    "it is perhaps interesting to note that the proof of theorem 1 makes no restriction on @xmath129 .",
    "thus theorem 1 applies even if alice and bob share entangled states that they both trust prior to the initialization of the bc protocol .",
    "corollary 1 : :    in any bc protocol , the optimal trade - off between @xmath130 and @xmath43 is a curve satisfying    @xmath131 ( the lower bound    corresponds to curve i in fig .",

    "however , corollary 1 says _ more _ than this , since it also sets a lower bound on the extent to which any bc  protocol can be partially concealing and partially binding .",

    "* proof of theorem 2 .",
    "* inequality ( i ) follows trivially from theorem 1 , since if @xmath139 for _ all _ bc protocols then clearly @xmath140 for any alice - supplied bc protocol .",

    "we briefly discuss the relevance of these results to coin tossing@xcite .",
    "coin tossing(ct ) is a cryptographic task wherein at the end of the protocol both parties decide , based on the outcome of their measurements , whether they have won , lost , or detected the other party cheating .",
    "if neither party is caught cheating , then the protocol must be such that the two parties agree on who won the coin toss .",
    "we can define a party s _ bias _ in a ct protocol as the difference between their probability of winning and 1/2 .",
    "a ct protocol with maximum bias @xmath208 for alice and maximum bias @xmath209 for bob is one where if bob is honest , the maximum alice can make her probability of winning is @xmath210 , and if alice is honest , the maximum bob can make his probability of winning is @xmath211 ct can be built upon bc as follows . after the commitment phase",
    ", bob sends alice a bit which represents his guess of her commitment .",
    "if his guess corresponds to the bit alice unveils , he wins the coin toss ; if not , alice wins .",
    "our results show that it is possible to build a secure ct protocol for any pair of biases satisfying @xmath212 and that this inequality can be saturated . in particular , a fair ct protocol with both biases equal to @xmath213 can be built up in this way .",
    "since ct is a weaker primitive than bc@xcite , the impossibility of a bc protocol that is arbitrarily concealing and binding does _ not _ imply the impossibility of a ct protocol with arbitrarily small biases for both parties@xcite .",
    "whether such a protocol is possible remains an open question in quantum cryptography .",
    "it should be noted that even if such a ct protocol does not exist , the fact that there exist ct protocols with bounded biases for both parties is still potentially very useful .",
    "for instance , these can provide protocols for gambling@xcite wherein both parties ( the casino and the gambler ) can be assured that their probability of winning is greater than some bound , regardless of the actions of the other party .",
    "the central result of this paper has been the _ maximization _ of alice s control for certain bc protocols .",
    "however , alice may wish to sacrifice some control in order to reduce her probability of being caught cheating . specifically ,",
    "if alice assigns costs to the various outcomes of a bc protocol , then in order to optimize her costs she must know the _ minimum _",
    "probability of being caught cheating for every possible degree of control .",
    "since this probability quantifies the degree to which she has ` disturbed ' the outcome of the protocol from what it would have been had she been honest , we may call the result of this optimization problem the _ control vs. disturbance _ relation .",
    "it is also interesting to consider a simple generalization of bc ( which one might call ` integer commitment ' ) , wherein alice seeks to unveil one of a set of more than two integers ( rather than just ` 0 ' or ` 1 ' ) , and to consider the generalization of the optimization problems mentionned above , namely , the problems of determining the maximum probability that alice can successfully unveil the integer of her choosing . and the minimal probability of being caught cheating for every possible probability of success .",
    "these optimization problems have obvious analogies in the context of quantum state estimation .",
    "when discriminating a set of states , one often seeks to determine both the maximum probability of correctly estimating the state ( the maximum information gain ) , as well as the minimum disturbance upon the system that is incurred for every possible degree of information gain ( the information gain vs. disturbance relation ) .",
    "this suggests that it may be fruitful to pursue the analogy between the notions of control and information gain in more detail . in future work",
    "we hope to consider these optimization problems in the context of purification bc protocols .",
    "we have studied the extent to which bc protocols can be made simultaneously both partially concealing and partially binding .",
    "the degrees of concealment and bindingness were quantified by bob s maximum information gain about the bit committed and alice s maximum control over the bit she unveils . a lower bound on alice s maximum control and bob s maximum information gain for _",
    "any _ bc protocol has been derived , although it is not known whether or not this bound can be saturated .",
    "a stronger lower bound was obtained for a restricted class of bc protocols , called ` alice - supplied ' protocols , wherein alice provides bob with all of the systems that he makes use of during the commitment phase .",
    "moreover , this lower bound has been shown to be saturated by what we have called a ` purification ' bc protocol , wherein an honest alice must prove her commitment to bob by providing him with a purification of the state she submitted to him during the commitment phase .",
    "we have also considered the trade - off between concealment and bindingness for alice - supplied bc  protocols given different constraints on @xmath107 and @xmath127 ( these are the states of the systems in bob s possession during the holding phase given commitments of @xmath3 and @xmath1 respectively )",
    ". such constraints might arise from practical restrictions on the physical implementation of a bc protocol .",
    "we have shown that for bc protocols where @xmath105 and @xmath127 have supports in a single 2d hilbert space , or wherein @xmath107 and @xmath127 are not both mixed , one can not achieve the optimal trade - off relation ( that is , the optimal degree of bindingness for every degree of concealment ) . using protocols wherein @xmath107 and @xmath108 are both pure , one does even worse . the optimal trade - off for alice - supplied bc protocols",
    "is @xmath214 and can be achieved using a purification bc protocol wherein @xmath107 and @xmath127 are mixed but commuting states of a 3-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the following question concerning the degrees of concealment and bindingness in bc  protocols remains unanswered : do there exist any bc protocols with a trade - off relation that is better than the linear trade - off relation @xmath215 in order to settle this question , the scope of our analysis must be extended beyond alice - supplied protocols .",
    "we conjecture that the linear trade - off is in fact the optimal trade - off from among _ all _ bc protocols .",
    "we end with some comments on the broader significance of the results of this paper .",
    "alice s cheating strategy in a bc protocol is an example of a task that can be described as the preparation of quantum states at a remote location .",
    "there are many tasks of this sort , which differ in the constraints imposed upon the ` preparer ' .",
    "these constraints may specify what is known about the state to be prepared , whether the parties involved in its implementation are cooperative or adversarial , and how much resource material is available , such as the number of classical or quantum bits that can be exchanged , and the amount of prior entanglement the parties share .",
    "for instance , in purification bc protocols , alice seeks to maximize her probability of remotely preparing one of two states of a bipartite system ( which may be entangled ) , given that bob is adversarial and given that she only learns which state she wishes to prepare after she has already submitted half of the system .",
    "( equivalently , one may say that the states which alice must remotely prepare are improper mixed states , and that she proves that she has done so by providing purifications of these states . )",
    "there has also been interest recently in a different sort of task involving the preparation of quantum states at a remote location @xcite . in this task ,",
    "the parties are cooperative and the optimization problem to be solved is the minimization of the number of classical bits of communication asymptotically required to remotely prepare a state for a given amount of prior entanglement .",
    "although this task has been called ` remote state preparation ' , this term may be better suited as a label for all tasks involving the preparation of quantum states at a remote location , just as the term ` state estimation ' refers to many tasks differing in the constraints imposed on the ` estimator ' .",
    "we feel that the general problem of remote state preparation may be , in some sense , as fundamental in quantum mechanics as the general problem of state estimation .",
    "in particular , a greater understanding of remote state preparation may have significance for foundational research .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the structure of quantum mechanics might be deduced from some simple information - theoretic principles , for instance , assumptions about how well information can be gathered , manipulated and stored in our universe .",
    "critical to the program is determining the extent to which various information processing tasks can be successfully implemented using quantum resources .",
    "the implications of our results for various cryptographic tasks constitute a contribution to this endeavour .",
    "ultimately however , the program requires understanding the success of all achievable tasks in terms of a few simple facts about information processing , for instance , facts about a few ` primitive ' tasks .",
    "it has been speculated by fuchs that the task of state estimation is such a primitive .",
    "we add to this our own speculation , namely , that the task of preparing quantum states at a remote location is another such primitive .    _ note added .",
