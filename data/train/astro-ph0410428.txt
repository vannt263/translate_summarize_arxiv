    "for a magnetized spinning degenerate compact star covered with a thin plasma layer referred to as an _ ocean _ , various magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) tidal waves , excited by relevant processes , may exist .",

    "this letter describes the theory of mhd tidal waves that propagate in a thin magnetized ocean of a spinning compact star . when combined with pertinent dynamic processes and emission mechanisms",
    ", such mhd tidal waves may leave indelible signatures of electromagnetic emissions in a wide spectrum ranging from the radio to gev gamma rays and could provide key diagnostics that might offer clues and hints of otherwise complex phenomena . in general , mhd tidal waves may be excited gravitationally , thermally , electromagnetically , or by impacts of accreting materials .",
    "while accretion activities may stir up and sustain these waves , wave signals might be undesirably entangled with or overwhelmed by accretion noises .",
    "once observationally established , these waves may be utilized to probe the structures in the _ surface layers _ of neutron stars and white dwarfs by extending or adapting the helioseismological techniques ( papaloizou & pringle 1978 ; van horn 1980 ; saio 1982 ; lou 2000 , 2001b ) .",
    "furthermore , damping properties of these waves might provide information of the stellar constituent materials and diffusion processes ( lou 1995 ) .",
    "mhd tidal waves may exist on spinning magnetic degenerate stars in either isolation or binaries ( chanmugam 1992 ; phinney & kulkarni 1994 ; bildsten & strohmayer 1999 ) , although they might have a better chance to be detected in high - mass and low - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs and lmxbs ) or cataclysmic variables . by strong gravity ,",
    "the magnetized plasma ocean on a degenerate star of radius @xmath0 is thin . as the ratio @xmath1 of electric force",

    "it is presumed that the ocean and an extended magnetosphere coexist on a compact star , that the magnetosphere maintains a pressure at the interface between the ocean and the magnetosphere much as the earth s atmosphere does on the ocean ( gill 1982 ) , and that magnetic fields ( idealized as a split monople ) are in and out radially across the thin ocean of thickness @xmath9 . for a zonal magnetic field ,",
