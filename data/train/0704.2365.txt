    "polarized neutrons ( a beam of cold neutrons in almost all cases ) are let decay in a decay volume and electrons from the neutron decay are guided by a strong magnetic field towards one of the two electron detectors located at the ends of the decay volume .",
    "when the detectors have a @xmath29 coverage of @xmath1 decay events , the asymmetry in the count rate in the two detectors can be related to the @xmath23 coefficient as follows : @xmath30 where @xmath17 is the electron s energy , @xmath31 is the count rate in detector 1(2 ) , @xmath32 is the average polarization of the neutrons , and @xmath1 is the velocity of the electron in the units of the velocity of light .    three major sources of systematic uncertainties can be identified in the previous experiments .",
    "they are ( 1 ) neutron polarization determination , ( 2 ) background , and ( 3 ) detector effects including backscattering of @xmath1 particles . as evident from eq .",
    "[ eq : a ] , the polarization determination has to be done to a precision better than the precision to which @xmath23 is to be determined . also",
    ", incomplete knowledge of the background signal will lead to an erroneous determination of @xmath31 , thereby giving an erroneous determination of @xmath23 . with regard to the detector effects , due to the small end point energy of the electron spectrum ( @xmath33  kev ) ,",
    "a significant fraction ( @xmath34 for plastic scintillation counters ) of electrons from neutron @xmath1 decay directed to one detector can backscatter from the surface of the detector and are detected by the other detector .",
    "a non - negligible fraction of the backscattered electrons leave undetectably small energy deposition in the first detector , hence introducing an error in the asymmetry determination .",
    "( these electrons are called missed backscattered electrons . )",
    "understanding the backscattering of low energy electrons and properly characterizing the detector response is clearly of vital importance .    in order to address the unsatisfactory situation represented in fig .",

    "[ tab : systematics ] , major systematic corrections applied to the results of the recent four measurements are listed .",
    "it is seen that corrections that are significantly larger than the reported uncertainty were applied .",
    "experiments with low background , high polarization ( @xmath37% ) , and small detector effects are highly desirable since they do not require large corrections , thus improving the reliability of systematic error assignment .",
    ".major systematic correction in the recent @xmath23 measurements[tab : systematics ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "there are in fact several experiments ongoing or planned to measure @xmath23 with a higher precision .",
    "since their last publication  @xcite , perkeo ii collaboration have implemented some upgrades , including a new ballistic supermirror guide for a higher neutron flux  @xcite and a new crossed supermirror polarizers for a higher neutron polarization  @xcite . at the same time , a new experiment perkeo iii has been developed .",
    "there are two major efforts under way to measure @xmath23 in us .",
    "the ucna experiment  @xcite , currently being commissioned at los alamos national laboratory , aims at a 0.2% measurement of @xmath23 using ultracold neutrons ( ucns ) .",
    "the abba collaboration proposes to perform a simultaneous measurements of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and the fierz interference term @xmath38 ( which is zero in the sm ) at the spallation neutron source ( sns )  @xcite .",
    "the goal of the abba experiment is to determine @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath38 with an absolute precision of @xmath39 in order to address known problems in previous experiments , the abba experiment includes several new features such as , the use of pulsed neutron source , the use of a polarized helium-3 transmission cell as a neutron polarizer , coincidence detection of the decay electrons and the protons , and the use of segmented silicon detectors . since in the sm",
    ", @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 depends only on @xmath7 , the consistency among @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 will provide a powerful check for potential systematics .",
    "there are also efforts to improve the precision of @xmath22 .",
    "the acorn experiment , being prepared at nist , aims to determine @xmath22 to a statistical precision of 1% or less by performing coincidence detection of electrons and recoil protons and selecting two kinematic regions such that a comparison of the rates in the two regions directly yields a measurement of @xmath22  @xcite .",
    "the aspect experiment , currently being developed at mainz and will be run at ill , will measure the recoil proton energy spectrum using a magnetic spectrometer with electrostatic retardation potentials  @xcite .",
    "the expected precision is @xmath40% .",
    "below , we discuss the ucna experiment more in detail .",
    "the goal of the ucna experiment is a 0.2% measurement of @xmath23 . unlike previous experiments , which used a beam of cold neutrons from a reactor , the ucna experiment uses ucns produced by a pulsed spallation ucns source  @xcite .",
    "ucns are neutrons with total kinetic energy less than the effective potential @xmath41 presented by a material boundary .",
    "these neutrons , therefore , can be confined in a material bottle .",
    "typically @xmath42  nev , which corresponds to velocities of order 5  m / s , wavelengths of order 500   and an effective temperature of order 2  mk .",
    "there are two major advantages in using such a neutron source .",
    "first , the kinetic energy of ucn is so small that the potential energy associated with the interaction of the neutron magnetic moment with a magnetic field ( @xmath43 ) can be easily made comparable or even higher than the kinetic energy using an electromagnet that can produce a magnetic field of several tesla ( 1.7  t field gives @xmath44  nev ) .",
    "therefore , by passing ucns through a region with a large magnetic field ( @xmath45  t ) , it is possible to filter out neutrons with one spin state , thereby making them 100% spin - polarized .",
    "second , by operating the accelerator in a pulsed mode , it is possible to limit the emission of background radiation to the period in which the beam pulse strikes the target . by performing a measurement only when there is no beam pulse striking the target , it is possible to perform a measurement with very low background",
    "this is a big advantage of spallation sources over reactor sources , which generate continuous background radiation .",
    "ucns are produced by the lansce solid deuterium ucn source , sent through a polarizer / spin flipper , and then introduced into a decay volume .",
    "the wall of the decay volume is a 3  m - long diamond coated quartz cylinder 10  cm in diameter .",
    "the decay volume is in the warm bore of a superconducting solenoidal magnet , which provides a holding field of 1  t. the decay electrons spiral along the magnetic field lines towards one of the detectors , and then enter the field expansion region , where the magnetic field is reduced to 0.6  t. as an electron enters the field expansion region , the energy associated with the angular motion of the electron is transfered to longitudinal motion in order to conserve angular momentum as the diameter of the spiral increases due to the reduced field .",
    "this reduces the incident angle of the electron onto the detector surface ( reverse of the magnetic mirror effect ) and suppresses backscattering .",
    "the detectors are placed in a region where the expanded field is uniform .",
    "the schematic of the ucna experiment is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ucna_schematic ] .",
    "each electron detector is comprised of a thin low - pressure multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) placed in front of a plastic scintillator .",
    "the mwpc consists of a thin front window ( kelvar supported 6  @xmath46m - thick mylar ) , a gas volume filled with neopentane , cathode planes made of 50  @xmath46 m diameter aluminum wires strung with a 2.54  mm spacing , an anode plane made of 10  @xmath46 m diameter tungsten wires strung with a 2.54  mm spacing , and a thin exit window ( 6  @xmath46m - thick mylar )  @xcite . the mwpc provides the position information with a resolution of @xmath47  mm , which is important in rejecting @xmath1-decay events that occur near the wall of the decay volume .",
    "also the combination of the thin entrance window and the fact that mwpcs are in general more sensitive to small energy depositions than plastic scintillator reduces the fraction of missed backscattered events . on top of this",
    ", detailed studies of low energy electron backscattering were performed  @xcite to help build a reliable model of missed backscattered events , which will be necessary in applying a small correction due to the missed backscattered events to the final results .",
    "furthermore , a small spectrometer was built to provide a monoenergetic electron beam for off - line calibration of the detector system  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : beta ] shows an energy spectrum of the decay electrons from ucns that the collaboration obtained during their 2006 commissioning run .",
    "this is the first @xmath1 decay spectrum measured with ucns .",
    "the collaboration is hoping to make a @xmath48% measurement of @xmath23 during year 2007 .",
    "determination of @xmath0 from neutron @xmath1 decay with an improved precision will provide a useful cross check of the current determination of @xmath0 from nuclear @xmath1 decays .",
    "furthermore , precision measurements of neutron decay parameters hold the most promise for a further improvement of the determination of @xmath0 .",
    "currently there are a number of experiments ongoing and planned that will determine @xmath23 and @xmath22 to a relative precision of the order of 0.1% , which , combined with a neutron life measurement with a precision of 0.1% , provide a determination of @xmath0 with a similar precision to that from nuclear @xmath1 decay ."
