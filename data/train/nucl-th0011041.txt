    "recently , comprehensive measurements of total and differential cross sections of inclusive , coherent and incoherent @xmath5-photoproduction from the deuteron in the energy region from 200 to 792 mev were carried out at mami @xcite .",
    "it was found that the coherent data are in good agreement with theoretical predictions .",
    "however , in the case of the incoherent cross sections the situation is much less satisfactory .",
    "the theoretical predictions from refs .",
    "@xcite in the @xmath3-region are significantly above the data .",
    "it is evident that the model of ref .",
    "@xcite can hardly provide a reasonable description of the data on pion photoproduction from the deuteron since it takes into account the pole diagrams only .",
    "it is known that the effect of nucleon - nucleon final state interaction ( fsi ) is extremely important in incoherent photoproduction especially for small pion angles ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "although fsi was incorporated in the model of ref .",
    "@xcite , it nevertheless failed to reproduce the data . a possible reason for this may be that laget used in his calculations of the @xmath6 process the well - known blomqvist - laget ( bl ) parametrization @xcite of the pion photoproduction amplitude on the nucleon .",
    "this parametrization gives a satisfactory fit to the amplitude for charged pion photoproduction .",
    "but it is not able to describe @xmath7 production from the proton . since data on @xmath7 production from the neutron",
    "are absent there is no possibility to check the reliability of the bl model in the description of this channel .",
    "an attempt to remedy this defect in ref .",
    "@xcite led to a @xmath5-photoproduction amplitude which is not very suitable for the use in nuclear calculations .    in our previous analyses of @xmath5-photoproduction from the deuteron",
    "@xcite we also used the bl operator .",
    "however , in those cases it was quite justified due to the following reasons . in ref .",
    "@xcite we studied the incoherent reaction @xmath8 in the @xmath3-region in the neutron quasi - free kinematics .",
    "our main purpose was to estimate the relative contributions of the neutron pole diagram and background effects due to fsi and @xmath9 rescattering .",
    "since all these ingredients depend on the same pion photoproduction amplitude , the relative contributions are therefore not very sensitive to its magnitude . in ref .",
    "@xcite the reaction was considered in the threshold region . there , only the charged channels are of importance because of a big @xmath10 rescattering effect and the use of the bl operator is certainly possible .    in this article",
    "we present a new computation of the inclusive reaction @xmath11 in the first resonance region .",
    "the main difference between the present calculation and the one of ref .",
    "@xcite is , that a more realistic version of the elementary pion photoproduction operator is used .",
    "it is taken in the standard cgln form @xcite with four partial amplitudes @xmath12 calculated with the use of the said @xcite and maid @xcite multipole analyses .. needed in practical calculations , the nucleon compton scattering operator was taken in that work in on - shell form with partial amplitudes obtained in the framework of dispersion approach @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) . ] since a generalization of the approach into charged pion photoproduction is straightforward we take the opportunity to consider all possible inclusive channels @xmath13 restricting ourselves , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , to the first resonance region .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ kinema ] , kinematical relations used within calculations are briefly reviewed .",
    "a description of the theoretical model and its ingredients is given in sect .",
    "[ theory ] . in sect .",
    "[ results ] , we compare our results with all available experimental data . in appendix [ append2 ]",
    "an extension of the non - relativistic approximations of the bonn obe potential is described , in order to make them applicable to @xmath14 and @xmath15 scattering .",
    "kinematical relations between the variables in the so - called photon - nucleon c.m .",
    "frame and the ones in the @xmath16 c.m .",
    "frame are given in appendix  [ append1 ] .",
    "let us denote by @xmath17 and @xmath18 the 4-momenta of the initial photon and deuteron , the final pion and nucleons , respectively .",
    "a symbol @xmath19 is reserved for the lab photon energy ( @xmath20 ) and a symbol @xmath21 will be used for the photon energy in the @xmath16 c.m .",
    "frame : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being the deuteron mass .",
    "it is convenient to take as independent kinematical variables the photon energy and pion momentum @xmath25 in the used frame of reference ( generally , the lab or c.m . frame ) and the angles @xmath26 and @xmath27 of one of the nucleons in the c.m .",
    "frame of the final @xmath28 pair . using the equality [ p_cm ] w_nn=2_p=2= , where @xmath29 is the averaged mass of the final nucleons",
    ", one can find the momentum @xmath30 .",
    "after boosting the momenta @xmath30 and @xmath31 with the velocity @xmath32 the momenta of the outgoing nucleons are obtained and , therefore , the kinematics is totally determined .",

    "as in our previous papers on @xmath5-photoproduction from the deuteron @xcite we will exploit the diagrammatic approach to calculate the amplitude @xmath46 .",
    "however , we reduce the set of diagrams under consideration . for example , in ref .  @xcite working in the threshold region we were forced to take into account a two loop diagram which includes simultaneously @xmath47 and @xmath9 interactions .",
    "such a diagram is of importance at threshold energies since it involves a block with charged pion photoproduction from the nucleon . with increasing photon energy",
    "this diagram becomes less important ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . above 200 mev",
    "it can safely be disregarded .",
    "it is known ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) that there are kinematical regions where a one loop diagram with @xmath9 rescattering noticeable contributes to the amplitude . but",
    "this rather concerns the exclusive process @xmath48 .",
    "we have checked that @xmath9 rescattering changes the final results in the first resonance region only by a few percent .    as a result ,",
    "we retain in our calculations the two diagrams shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the pole diagram [ fig1]@xmath49 must be considered since at the integrations in eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) there are the kinematical regions where one of nucleons ( or both simultaneously ) has a small momentum , the so - called quasi - free regions .",
    "these lead to peaks in the exclusive cross sections .",
    "the inclusive cross section from the pole diagrams is mainly saturated in these peaks .",
    "when at the integration mentioned above @xmath50 is approaching @xmath40 and , therefore , @xmath51 , the relative momenta ( @xmath52 ) of the outgoing nucleons become small .",
    "now there are peaks in the exclusive cross sections due to strong @xmath0 interaction in the @xmath53-waves ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) which manifest themselves in a big contribution of diagram [ fig1]@xmath54 to the inclusive cross section .",
    "this effect is expected to be most pronounced at small pion angles since in this case the kinematics permits both for the deuteron wave function ( dwf ) and @xmath0 scattering amplitude to work simultaneously in low momentum regime .",
    "the above mentioned smallness of the @xmath9 rescattering effects can be explained also by the fact that the @xmath53-wave @xmath9 scattering lengths are about two orders smaller than those for @xmath0 scattering .",
    "let us now write out the matrix elements corresponding to the diagrams in fig .  [ fig1 ]",
    "( see also refs .",
    "one has for the pole diagram [ fig1]_a _ [ pole ] m_2m_1| t^a(k , q , p_2 ) | m_d=_m_1 ^m_d_m_2m_1(p_2 - 2 ) m_1| t_n_1(k_n_1,q_n_1 ) | m_1 , where @xmath55 is dwf and @xmath56 is the amplitude of the elementary process @xmath57 .",
    "the amplitude depends on photon ( @xmath58 ) and pion ( @xmath59 ) momenta taken in the c.m .",
    "frame of the @xmath60 pair .",
    "these momenta can be obtained from the corresponding momenta in the used frame of reference through a boost with the velocity @xmath61 .",
    "of course there is one more pole diagram identical to that in fig .",
    "[ fig1]_a _ but with the replacement @xmath62 .",
    "in case of @xmath5-photoproduction the corresponding matrix element should be added to eq .",
    "( [ pole ] ) .",
    "for the charged channels a subtraction of two matrix elements should be done .",
    "the calculations were done using dwf for the non - relativistic versions of the bonn obe potential ( obepr ) @xcite .",
    "in fact , in those papers three obepr models where built . a parametrization for one of them",
    "was given in table  14 of ref .",
    "two other parametrizations were given in table  a.3 of ref .",
    "@xcite denoted in that table by `` a '' and `` b '' . for these three versions we shall use the notations `` obepr'',``obepr(a ) '' and `` obepr(b ) '' , respectively .",
    "analytical parametrizations of the @xmath53- and @xmath63-amplitudes of dwf for these three models were taken from ref .",
    "we would like to note here that our results are practically independent of the choice of the potentials so that all results below were obtained with the obepr model .",
    "it has been noted in sect .",
    "[ intr ] that in our previous papers @xcite on @xmath5-photoproduction from the deuteron we used the bl operator to calculate the amplitude @xmath64 .",
    "in the present paper the latter was obtained with the use of multipole analyses .",
    "the cgln operator has the following form : [ cgln ] t_nn = m .",
    "it is written in the @xmath9 c.m .",
    "frame so that all vectors in eq .",
    "( [ cgln ] ) should be taken in this frame .",
    "of course , the partial amplitudes @xmath65 are also functions of the photon energy @xmath21 and pion angle @xmath66 in the same frame .",
    "therefore , in practical calculations , in particular at the numerical integration in eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) ( and in eq .",
    "( [ np - resc ] ) , see below ) one has to make lorenz transformations to this frame for every grid point .",
    "but such a procedure is of no principal difficulty and does not require time - consuming computations .",
    "we do not give here explicit expressions for the amplitudes @xmath12 through electric and magnetic multipoles and the derivatives of the legendre polynomials @xcite since they are very well - known .",
    "the multipoles are taken from the said @xcite and maid @xcite analyses .",
    "if not stated otherwise all results below have been obtained with the said multipoles .",
    "the matrix element corresponding to diagram [ fig1]_b _ is + & & m _ m_2m_1 , [ np - resc ] where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are the relative momenta of the @xmath28 pair after and before scattering , respectively , and @xmath69 is the half off - shell @xmath0 scattering amplitude .",
    "we will not discuss here details of the computations of the amplitude ( [ np - resc ] ) because they are given in ref .",
    "note that all partial waves with the total angular momentum @xmath70 and 1 were retained in the @xmath0 scattering amplitude .",
    "in fact , however , only two waves , @xmath71 and @xmath72 , are of importance when the inclusive channels are considered .",
    "all other waves give a few percent contribution to the cross section .",
    "the same obepr models of @xmath0 interaction were used when solving the lippmann - schwinger equation for the @xmath0 scattering amplitude needed for the calculations of diagram [ fig1]_b_. it must be noted , however , that those models are valid for @xmath47 interaction only .",
    "therefore , they should be modified in such a way that they may be applicable to @xmath14 and @xmath15 interactions as well .",
    "we follow a procedure for such a modification proposed in ref .",
    "it is described in some detail in appendix [ append2 ] .    as in our previous papers @xcite , all summations over polarizations of the particles in eqs .",

    "( [ np - resc ] ) have been carried out numerically . the number of chosen nodes at this integration and that in eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) was taken to be sufficient for prediction of the differential cross section with the numerical accuracy better than 2% .",

    "[ fig2 ] , the predicted differential cross sections of this reaction are shown at energies between 208 and 456 mev together with experimental results from ref .",
    "c.m . frame to the frame mentioned are presented in appendix   [ append1 ] .",
    "] one can see one more confirmation of a prediction of refs .",
    "@xcite that the effect of @xmath47 final state interaction should lead to a reduction of the cross section and this reduction is the stronger the smaller the pion angles are .",
    "this effect is mainly attributed to the strong repulsive @xmath47 interaction in the @xmath72 wave .    without fsi",
    "the model totally fails to reproduce the data . after including fsi one has a quite reasonable description of the data at all energies except for @xmath74 mev in the backward direction .",
    "only the points corresponding to @xmath75 at energies from 285 to 362 mev are noticeably below the curves .",
    "but it is difficult to draw smooth curves through the data if these points are included .    in the same figure",
    "we compare our results with those from refs .",
    "since in ref .",
    "@xcite fsi was disregarded one could expect the dotted curves to be close to the predictions of that work .",
    "in fact , one has some deviation which is reduced when the energy approaches the @xmath3-position .",
    "a reason for this deviation may be due to the use of different pion photoproduction operators since the only remaining ingredient of the models , namely the deuteron wave functions , are very similar for all modern @xmath0 potentials . indeed , a comparison of predictions for the total cross sections of the reaction @xmath76 given in fig .  2 of ref .",
    "@xcite with those calculated with the said ( and maid ) multipoles shows that these former go above the latter .",
    "an analogous reason seems to be responsible for the disagreement between our full calculation and the predictions from ref .",
    "@xcite where fsi was taken into account . as already mentioned in sect .",
    "[ intr ] , the bl operator is not good for the description of neutral pion photoproduction . the deviation is clearly seen at @xmath77 above 300 mev .    to illustrate ,",
    "we show at 324 mev the contribution from the pole diagram with @xmath5-photoproduction from the proton .",
    "a constructive effect of two mechanisms with quasi - free pion photoproduction on separate nucleons is obvious .",
    "one can see that at backward pion angles the total contribution of the pole diagrams is practically equal to the direct sum of the contributions of each diagram so that the interference term is very small .",
    "the reason for this is that at backward angles the kinematics does not allow both nucleons to have simultaneously small momenta and , therefore , both diagrams can not work in the quasi - free regime .    after integrating eq .",
    "( [ dcs ] ) over the solid pion angle one obtains the total cross section for a given channel . in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the total cross section for @xmath5-photoproduction is shown .",
    "as in the case of the differential cross section , one can see that without fsi the model clearly overestimates the data .",
    "after inclusion of fsi one has good agreement with the data . only in the center of the peak our model overestimates the measured cross sections by about 25 @xmath78 . note that the inclusion of fsi does not shift the position of this peak .",
    "this fact has a simple explanation .",
    "indeed , diagram @xmath54 in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] contains the same @xmath79 amplitude as the pole diagram @xmath80 . taking into account that the integral over the loop is saturated at small momenta due to the deuteron wave function , the boosts mentioned in sect .  [ theory ] lead only to small shifts in energies .",
    "therefore , the @xmath81 vertex works practically in the same energy regime as it does in the pole diagrams .",
    "it is clear that the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite totally fails to describe the data , as can be expected from the previous discussion .",
    "although fsi was taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite , the predictions from that work give still too high cross sections .",
    "we begin the discussion of charged pion photoproduction with the @xmath82 channel .",
    "there is one experimental article @xcite which supplies us with a lot of data points in the energy region from 0.2 to 2.0 gev .",
    "however , we will discuss the first resonance region only . in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the predicted differential cross sections are shown at energies ranging from 210 to 540 mev . the dotted curves which correspond to the contribution of one pole diagram , reproduce the behaviour of the angular dependence for the differential cross section of the elementary reaction @xmath83 .",
    "in particular , at energies above 400 mev the strong forward peak due to the contribution of the pion exchange in the @xmath84-channel is clearly seen .",
    "after inclusion of the second pole diagram one has a drastic reduction of the cross section at forward pion angles , exhibiting the total difference from the case of neutral pion photoproduction and showing how the pauli principle manifests itself .",
    "one can again see that at backward angles the cross section from two pole diagrams is practically equal to twice the cross section from one diagram .",
    "the effect of fsi in the case of the charged channels is expected to be quite different in comparison with the neutral one .",
    "since only @xmath53-wave @xmath0 interaction is of importance for the inclusive @xmath13 reaction , fsi shows up in the charged channels through attractive interaction in the @xmath71 wave .",
    "this interaction is again significant at small pion angles but has to lead to an increase of the differential cross section . a confirmation of our anticipations is seen in fig .",
    "a very interesting observation is that above 400 mev the cross section again becomes to be strongly forward peaked but now due to fsi .",
    "after inclusion of fsi we obtain good agreement with the data from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "at 350 mev we compare our results with those from ref .",
    "one can see that there is agreement in the shapes of the angular distributions but we predict lower values for the cross sections .",
    "the total cross section for @xmath85-photoproduction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] . here",
    "the contribution of fsi is noticeable smaller than that for @xmath5-production and leads to an increase of the cross section .",
    "we find good agreement with the data from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite but the data from ref .",
    "@xcite lie above our solid curve at @xmath86 mev . at the same time",
    "a data pion from ref .",
    "@xcite at 250 mev lies markedly below both our predictions and the data from refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "theoretical predictions from refs .",
    "@xcite are also shown in fig .",
    "they are very close to each other and are able to reproduce the data only below 250 mev .    in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] we give our results for @xmath87-photoproduction .",
    "all the theoretical conclusions we have just drawn for the case of @xmath85-photoproduction are valid for the @xmath87 channel as well . to our knowledge",
    "there are no data on this process in the first resonance region so that we can not compare our predictions with experimental results .    having results for the total cross sections in all the channels mentioned above one can try to make predictions for the total photoabsorption cross section on the deuteron in the first resonance region",
    "of course , two more reactions contribute to it as well .",
    "these are coherent @xmath5-photoproduction from the deuteron ( @xmath88 ) and deuteron photodisintegration ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "predictions for the former are taken from a theoretical paper @xcite which are in good agreement with the data from ref .",
    "the total cross sections for the latter reaction were calculated making use of a phenomenological fit @xcite to available experimental data up to 440 mev .    in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] we present our results for the total photoabsorption cross section per nucleon for the deuteron .",
    "good agreement with the data is seen excluding , however , the @xmath3-peak region . in the center of the peak at about 320 mev",
    "we find our results with said and maid multipoles to overestimate the experimental value of @xmath89 by 33 @xmath78 and 48 @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "we have no explanation for this disagreement .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results of the direct measurements of the total photoabsorption cross section for the deuteron from refs .",
    "@xcite and those which can be extracted from the data on the separate channels contributing to this cross section .",
    "let us try to put together all available data at 320 mev . from ref .",
    "@xcite one has for the @xmath73 and @xmath90 channels @xmath91 and @xmath92 , respectively ( the additional normalization error of 6% has been added ) .",
    "the result for the @xmath82 channel from refs .",
    "@xcite is @xmath93 ( again the additional normalization error of 5% has been added ) . at 320 mev",
    "the phenomenological fit @xcite gives @xmath94 for the contribution of deuteron photodisintegration .",
    "the errors in this number can be safely neglected . since there are no data on the @xmath95 channel in the @xmath3-region we accept for its contribution our theoretical prediction of @xmath96 .",
    "collecting all these numbers we obtain the value of @xmath97 for the total photoabsorption cross section per nucleon for the deuteron at 320 mev which is in disagreement with the results from refs .",
    "however , there exists good agreement with our values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 obtained with the said and maid multipoles , respectively .",
    "we have investigated inclusive single pion photoproduction on the deuteron in the first resonance region . unlike most previous calculations ,",
    "although not numerous , we have exploited as the elementary operator for pion photoproduction from the nucleon the one calculated with the said and maid multipoles rather than the commonly used blomqvist - laget one or an operator built in ref .",
    "we have found that the model involving the pole diagrams and fsi gives a good description of all available data both on the differential and total cross sections .",
    "this description is much better than that in other theoretical approaches .",
    "the only unsolved problem is that our predictions for the total photoabsorption cross section for the deuteron in the @xmath3-peak region overestimate the data by about 10% .",
    "we suppose , however , that there is some inconsistency in the experimental results .",
    "new measurements , both inclusive single pion photoproduction on the deuteron in all inelastic channels and total photoabsorption cross section for the deuteron , would be extremely desirable and could shed more light on possible reasons for the above disagreement .",
    "we would like to thank b. krusche and a.i .",
    "lvov for many fruitful discussions .",
    "we are very grateful to s.s .",
    "kamalov for providing us with the results of his calculations and to r. machleidt for a computer code for the cd - bonn potential .",
    "this work was supported by deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft under contract 436 rus 113/510 .",
    "used through this article the bonn obepr model @xcite is valid , strictly speaking , for @xmath47 interaction only . since in our consideration of charged pion photoproduction the amplitudes of @xmath14 and @xmath15 interactions",
    "are also needed we have to modify the potential so that it could be applicable to these interactions too . to do this",

    "@xcite which consists in adding coulomb interaction to the original bonn model and making small adjustments of the parameters of the model .",
    "interaction . such a model called ` cd - bonn '",
    "has recently been built by machleidt @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , all our main calculations had already been finished when we got to know about the new potential .",
    "very first estimates made with this potential show only small variations , within less than 1% , of the presented results . ]    a method to handle coulomb interaction in momentum space was proposed by vincent and phatak @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss it here since it is described in full detail in that article ( see also refs .",
    "we only mention that we applied the method to the @xmath71 partial wave .",
    "all other waves with @xmath70 and 1 were taken for the switched off coulomb potential .",
    "it makes no sense to include the coulomb modifications for the waves other than @xmath71 , since the contributions of these former to the differential and total cross sections were found to be very small .",
    "coulomb interaction is mainly responsible for the difference of the @xmath14 and @xmath15 scattering lengths .",
    "but the difference of the @xmath14 and @xmath47 scattering lengths is due to the breaking of the charge independence of the nuclear force .",
    "the major reason for it is the pion mass splitting . this effect was not taken into account in the construction of the bonn potentials .",
    "at least quantitatively , the differences above can be modelled by a procedure given in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that article",
    "it was proposed to vary the coupling constants of the @xmath100 ( for the isospin @xmath101 channel ) and @xmath102 vertices keeping all other parameters of the model unchanged .",
    "these coupling constants were changed in such a way that the new model with the switched on coulomb potential describes the @xmath71 scattering length in the @xmath15 channel . at the same time in the @xmath72@xmath103 partial wave",
    "there were the same deuteron properties as for the original version of the potential .",
    "carrying out the proposed procedure we obtained the following coupling constants for the obepr , obepr(a ) and obepr(b ) models , respectively : 7.7135 , 8.6226 and 8.7316 for @xmath104 ( @xmath105 the former values 7.7823 , 8.7171 and 8.8322 ) and 2.586 , 2.81 and 6.744 for @xmath106 ( @xmath105 the former values 2.6713 , 2.742 and 6.729 ) .",
    "the resulting scattering lengths and effective ranges for three obepr models together with experimental values are given in table  [ tab1 ] .",
    "solving the lippmann - schwinger equation with the original and modified versions of the obepr models we directly obtained the partial half - off shell amplitudes for @xmath47 and @xmath14 scattering , respectively .",
    "for the @xmath15 scattering we used a prescription from ref .",
    "@xcite consisting of the following parametrization of the half - off - shell @xmath71 partial amplitude : t_off^^1s_0(|p_out|,|p_in| ) =   t_on^^1s_0(|p_out|,|p_out| ) , with @xmath107 @xmath108 and the on - shell amplitude @xmath109 is obtained with the use of the vincent and phatak method for the modified potentials with switched on coulomb interaction .",
    "in ref .  @xcite",
