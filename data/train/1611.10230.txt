    "neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields ( a.k.a . , magnetars ;  @xcite ) are characterized by highly energetic , short ( of ms duration ) repetitive x - ray bursts during active episodes lasting days to months . of the 29 magnetar candidates currently known  @xcite ,",
    "24 sources have emitted bursts with peak luminosities close to / in excess of the non - magnetic eddington limit .",
    "burst repetition behavior varies significantly among magnetar candidates .",
    "some magnetars emit tens , or even a few hundred bursts during an active episode  @xcite .",
    "others emit only one or several bursts , usually coincident with the onset of rapid x - ray intensity increase ( transient ) episodes , which last for months or even years @xcite .    according to the standard magnetar paradigm ,",
    "bursts are the results of sudden fracturing of the neutron star crust under high magnetic pressure  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , magnetar bursts have also been suggested to be the result of magnetic re - connection  @xcite . for both scenarios ,",
    "strong dipolar or multi - polar magnetic fields are expected .",
    "recently identified magnetars with low inferred dipole magnetic fields , seem to be in conflict with the magnetar burst picture .",
    "for example , sgr  0418 + 5729 was found to have an inferred dipole field of 6@xmath010@xmath1  g  @xcite .",
    "however , its surface magnetic field strength was determined to be 10@xmath2  g  @xcite via continuum x - ray spectral analysis , which is strong enough to trigger bursts .",
    "this finding was later confirmed by phase - resolved spectroscopy  @xcite , indicating that much stronger field strengths are likely in multi - polar magnetic structures .",
    "is the brightest , persistent x - ray source among magnetars and a prominent emitter in hard x - rays  @xcite , as well as in the optical and infrared  @xcite .",
    "this is the only magnetar with a debris disk  @xcite , however , it is still debated whether it is an active gaseous one  @xcite or a passive dust disk  @xcite .",
    "was once considered one of the most stable sources , emitting x - rays at a steady level  @xcite and exhibiting a secular spin - down trend .",
    "monitoring observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) revealed that emitted energetic bursts in 2006 and 2007 ; the first activation is also associated with a sudden rotational frequency jump or timing glitch @xcite .",
    "bursts from were highly unusual in the framework of typical magnetar bursts ; two of them were extremely long ( 434 , 1757  s ) and their spectra showed peculiar emission features  @xcite . recently ,",
    "@xcite re - analyzed the same data set and showed that these long events were bursts with extended tails , similar to those seen from sgr  1900 + 14  @xcite , sgr  1806@xmath320  @xcite , and sgr  1550@xmath35418  @xcite .",
    "time - resolved spectral analysis of these bursts using rxte data also revealed variable but highly prominent x - ray absorption features around 6.5 and 11 kev , and an emission line at at @xmath4 kev only during the very early episodes of their prolonged burst tails  @xcite .",

    "burst alert telescope ( bat )  @xcite and the gamma - ray burst monitor ( gbm )  @xcite on the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope .",
    "the bursts that triggered both bat and gbm , were typically short events with most durations less than 0.1  s. in this study , we have performed deep searches in the archival bat and gbm data to find additional events that were not luminous enough to trigger these instruments .",

    "_ swift_/bat triggered on a burst from on 2015 february 28 , at 04:53:25 ut  ( barthelmy el al .",
    "2015 ) . the rapid slew of the spacecraft to the direction of the source resulted in follow up observations in windowed timing mode with the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) on - board _ swift _ , starting at @xmath580  s after the bat trigger .",
    "we show in figure  [ bat_xrt_lc ] the simultaneous _ swift_/bat and xrt lightcurves in 1s time resolution .",
    "the initial burst trigger was not captured with xrt , however , a decaying extended emission tail is observed , with superposed periodic x - ray modulations . to precisely determine the source spin period , we employed two additional xrt observations ( 2015 february 26 ; observation i d : 00030738054 , exposure of 4.1 ks , & 2015 march 1 ; i d : 00030738055 , exposure of 4 ks ) .",
    "we were able to establish a short term phase - connected spin ephemeris of the source covering the duration of the tail .",
    "our timing solution yields a spin period p@xmath6 = 8.68892(3 ) s. on figure  [ bat_xrt_lc ] we indicate the peaks of the source spin phases as dotted vertical lines .",
    "further examination of the xrt lightcurve indicates the presence of sharp , short , intense bursts riding on the periodic x - ray modulations .",
    "the durations of these bursts do not exceed 100milliseconds , which is @xmath7 of the pulse period . to determine the statistical significance of these bursts we estimate the average level of the decaying emission tail ; we find that it follows an exponential trend with an initial rate of @xmath8 counts / s and an e - folding time of @xmath9s ( red line in left upper panel of figure  [ xrt_kt ] ) . to estimate the tail duration , we compared its intensity level to the two xrt observations of before and after the burst ( mentioned above ) .",
    "we find an average x - ray count rate of @xmath10 counts / s in both exposures , which is indicated with the overlapping horizontal dot - dashed lines in the upper left panel of figure  [ xrt_kt ] .",
    "we conclude that the x - ray tail emission had declined to the average pre- and post- burst level ( within errors ) by the end of the xrt pointing , thus constraining the total tail duration to @xmath11s .",
    "we now compare the position of the different structures ( pulses and bursts ) in the xrt lightcurve relative to the peaks of the pulse phase .",
    "we first estimate the 3.0 , and 4.5 @xmath12 levels above the average decay level ( blue and green lines in left upper panel of figure  [ xrt_kt ] ) .",
    "we define all intensity levels larger than 4.5 @xmath12 as bursts ; we consider data below this level as part of the pulsed modulation .",
    "we then fold the xrt lightcurves both below and above the 4.5 @xmath12 level .",
    "figure  [ xrt_kt ] ( right panel ) shows the two folded profiles : the upper closely reproduces the source pulse profile , while the lower exhibits the position of the bursts relative to the pulse peak phase .",
    "we note that the majority is within @xmath13 to @xmath14 of the pulse peak , with one exception at @xmath15 .",

    "the vertical dotted line indicates the pulse peak . ]",
    "although the xrt follow - up observation was short ( about 300 s ) , enough x - ray data were acquired for performing a spectral analysis of the tail emission , due to the enhancement of the persistent x - ray emission induced by the bursts . to search for spectral evolution over the course of the tail ,",
    "the spectrum was divided into three segments , each with a similar number of counts , defined as : interval i ( t+90  s to t+160  s ) , interval ii ( t+160  s to t+240  s ) , and interval iii ( t+240  s to t+390  s ) . the x - ray spectra extracted from all three segments , were simultaneously fit with an absorbed black - body ( bb ) plus power law ( pl ) model . as the interstellar hydrogen column density and power law index are not expected to vary over such a short duration , both parameters were linked so that they would converge to common values for all three spectra . during this process , we obtain a perfect fit ( @xmath17/degrees of freedom = 215/214 ) yielding @xmath18 = ( 1.2@xmath190.2)@xmath010@xmath20  @xmath21 , and @xmath22 = 2.7@xmath190.5 .",
    "the temperature trend of the bb component is clearly shown to decline over the three spectra , with temperatures of 1.61@xmath190.15  kev , 1.25@xmath190.09  kev and 0.96@xmath190.13  kev , measured for intervals i , ii and iii respectively ( see the lower left panel of figure  [ xrt_kt ] ) .",
    "the corresponding x - ray flux of this thermal component over the 0.5@xmath310 kev range for intervals i , ii and iii , was calculated to be ( 1.07@xmath190.13)@xmath010@xmath23 , ( 0.63@xmath190.14)@xmath010@xmath23 and ( 0.20@xmath190.10)@xmath010@xmath23  erg  @xmath21  s@xmath24 , respectively .",
    "the radius of the bb emitting region remains constant ( within errors ) at @xmath25  km , ( assuming the distance to the source to be 3.6  kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "the normalization ( i.e. , the flux ) of the power law component , which was allowed to float as a free parameter during the fitting process , remains constant within the determined errors . the spectra of the xrt observations two days before and a day after the enhancement are also suitably modeled with the absorbed bb plus pl , yielding @xmath26kev for the temperature of both intervals , and @xmath27 and @xmath28 for the pl indices before and after the reactivation episode , respectively .",

    "therefore , the first adjustment uses a likelihood function based on gaussian statistics rather than poisson statistics .",
    "secondly , in order to focus on the signals from the source direction , we provided mask - weighted lightcurves to the search rather than the event lists .",
    "the lightcurve was extracted in the 15 - 150  kev energy band with 4  ms resolution and the box - car size was set to 4  s. a more detailed description of the search procedure can be found in  @xcite . as a result of the aforementioned adjustments , our search found 13 additional bursts following the triggered event on 2011 july 29 , and eight un - triggered bursts on the 2015 february 28 ( which include three before the trigger ) .",

    "the compt model fits to some of these events were statistically acceptable , but yielded poorly constrained or unconstrained model parameters ( _ i.e. _ , the photon index , @xmath98 ) .",
    "further analysis fixed the photon index to be -1 , effectively turning the compt function into the functional form of the optically - thin thermal bremsstrahlung model .",
    "this resulted in the spectral cut - off energy parameter ( e@xmath101 ) being better constrained , with values varying between 30 and 50  kev ( see table  [ tab : spec ] ) .    in order to better constrain the parameters from the spectral fitting of the data using the aforementioned models ,",
    "a joint - stacked analysis was applied to all ten _ fermi_/gbm events .",
    "in addition to better constraining the spectral parameters through the minimization of the background using the limited amount of data available ( one detector per outburst episode satisfies the @xmath102@xmath10340@xmath54 criterion ) .",
    "this analysis also served to independently verify the _",
    "swift_/bat spectral results of the same events , which were analyzed using xspec .",
    "using an energy range of 8 - 200  kev and 8  ms time resolution , the bb+bb model was found to fit the combined data best .",
    "the bb+bb model fit to the stacked data , resulted in bb temperatures of @xmath104 = 3.9@xmath190.6 kev and @xmath105 = 16.6@xmath190.7 kev .",
    "the compt model fit the spectrum nearly well , yielding the pl index of @xmath98=-0.29@xmath190.18 and e@xmath106=60.9@xmath107 kev .",
    "the joint spectral analysis of the bat bursts observed in 2015 , also found the combined bb+bb model to best fit the data ( @xmath17/dof = 56.2/54 ) .",
    "the bb temperatures were determined to be @xmath104 = 3.9@xmath190.7 kev and @xmath105 = 16.9@xmath190.8 kev , which are in perfect agreement with the results of the gbm joint spectral analysis .",
    "for the joint spectra of the bat events , the compt and bb models performed worse with a @xmath17/dof = 64.6/55 and @xmath17/dof = 105.2/56 , respectively .",
    "the joint spectrum for all of the weak bursts detected by bat in 2011 , is equally well described with the compt ( @xmath17/dof = 46.1/55 ) and bb+bb models ( @xmath17/dof = 44.8/54 ) . for the former model , @xmath98",
    "was found to be unconstrained ( -0.31@xmath108 ) , while the temperatures of the latter model were well constrained : @xmath104 = 7.3@xmath191.2  kev and @xmath105 = 17.1@xmath109  kev .",
    "we have compiled the most comprehensive burst sample of , comprising 27 bursts from its three burst active episodes in 2011 , 2012 and the latest one in 2015 observed with _ swift_/bat and _ fermi_/gbm : we have enhanced the number of bursts from by about six - fold compared to what was previously observed ( gavrill et al .",
    "we discuss below characteristic properties of these bursts in relation to the bursts from other magnetars , the persistent emission behavior of the source , as well as the properties of extended tail emission we identified with _ swift_/xrt .",
    "the morphological properties of bursts from are similar to typical magnetar events .",
    "they all have a duration ranging from 4 to 700  ms , with more than 80  % of the bursts detected by bat lasting @xmath103 50  ms .",
    "although this sample size is too small to make any definitive conclusions regarding the duration of all bursts from this source , they do appear to be shorter than the burst durations of other magnetars ( see e.g. , g et al .",
    "2001 , gavriil et al .",
    "2004 , van der horst et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "the spectra of bursts from exhibit diverse characteristics .",
    "relatively dim bursts , with fluences less than 8@xmath010@xmath23  erg  @xmath21 , and almost all events observed during the 2011 activity episode , were best represented with a single black - body ( bb ) function .",
    "this is quite similar to what has been observed for the october 2008 bursts of sgr j1550 - 5418 ( von kienlin et al .",
    "2012 ) as well as the bursts from the first transient magnetar , xte j1810 - 197 .",
    "the bursts of the 2015 active episode are comparatively brighter and their spectral shapes are statistically better represented with more complex models , such as the sum of two black - bodies ( bb+bb ) or compt .",
    "the dilemma of whether typical magnetar burst spectra are predominately thermal ( bb+bb ) or non - thermal ( compt ) , is largely unresolved ( lin et al .",
    "2011 , van der horst et al .",
    "the thermal scenario of magnetar bursts may be indicative of emission originating from the neutron star surface due to either energy dissipated in the crust or surface heating by return currents from twisted magnetic field lines ( see _ e.g. _ , beloborodov & thompson 2007 ) , while the non - thermal model implies magnetospheric processes are more dominant .",
    "in reality , what unfolds in the vicinity of highly - magnetized systems is likely to be more complicated , and both surface and magnetospheric processes could be coupled together as a consequence of these environmental conditions .",
    "we find that the peak energy parameters of the compt model were of the order of or larger than 50  kev .",
    "this is in agreement with what has been measured for dim bursts from sgr 0501 + 4516 ( lin et al .",
    "2011 ) and sgr j1550@xmath35418 ( van der horst et al . 2012 ) . when the spectra are fit with a special case of the compt model , namely when its pl index is fixed to -1 , we obtained statistically acceptable fits to nearly all brighter bursts , and the peak energy was of the order of 40@xmath350  kev , or less .",
    "the temperatures of the bb+bb fits were around 3@xmath34  kev and 17  kev , similar to the spectral characteristics of bursts from other magnetars .",
    "broad - band spectral coverage is required to conclusively determine which of these models best represents the magnetar spectra ( lin et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the three burst - active episodes from presented here are not the only ones from this source .",
    "short bursts from were detected in monitoring observations of the source with rxte in 2006 and 2007 ( gavriil et al .",
    "a total of six bursts were reported , four of which were seen within about 4.5 minutes on 2006 june 25 .",
    "none of these six events were able to trigger the bat , which was the only wide - area sky - monitoring satellite at that time .",
    "magnetar burst - active episodes resemble that of magnetars with low - bursting rates ( with one or a few bursts per reactivation ) , such as sgr 0418 + 5729 ( van der horst et al .",
    "2010 ) , and sgr 1833@xmath30833 ( g et al . 2010 ) .",
    "however , there is an important difference between and the latter , namely , their outbursts usually lead to long - lasting ( months to years ) flux enhancements ( rea & esposito 2011 ) , while those of are not observed to cause any significant long - lasting flux enhancements , similar to the behavior observed with 1e 1841@xmath3045 ( lin et al .",
    "2013 ) .    undergoes an activity episode on a time - scale that ranges from several months to a few years . according to the magnetar model , the neutron star crust",
    "is stressed by the diffusion of the strong magnetic field which drives it to a critical strain , at which a slight disturbance could fracture the crust and give rise to energetic bursts ( thompson & duncan 1995 , thompson , yang and ortiz 2016 ) .",
    "this so - called self organized criticality ( soc ) , has been shown to occur in magnetar bursts ( g et al .",
    "1999 , 2000 ; gavriil et al .",
    "2004 , scholz & kaspi 2011 ) .",
    "the cluster of bursts seen in the 2011 and 2015 reactivation of also suggests the soc scenario : the impact of a leading burst in an activity phase brings the strain of nearby crustal sites to the level of criticality , quicker than their natural progression under internal and external magnetic stresses .",
    "note the important fact that the soc behavior is also expected to occur in the magnetic reconnection process ( aschwanden et al .",
    "2016 ) .",
    "the initial burst that triggered _",
    "swift_/bat on 2015 february 28 , led to the detection of the decaying flux enhancement or extended tail of the source emission .",
    "similar burst tails have been observed from other magnetars , such as ; sgr 1900 + 14 ( lenters et al . 2003 ) , sgr 1806 - 20 ( g et al .",
    "2011 ) , sgr 1550 - 5418 ( amaz mu et al .",
    "2015 ) , as well as from in 2006 ( gavriil et al . 2011 , chakraborty et al . 2016 ) .",
    "more recently , such a tail was identified following a burst from a rotation powered pulsar , psr j1119@xmath36127 ( g et al .",
    "the leading bursts in such events tend to be more energetic , however , an energetic event does not necessarily mean that an extended tail will be present .",
    "the x - ray spectra of all the extended tails exhibited thermal signatures .",
    "the tail discovered in this study is no exception ; the bb temperature declined from 1.6  kev to about 1  kev over the course of about 300  s. this is in line with previously observed extended burst tails ( see _ e.g. _ , lenters et al .",
    "2003 , g et al .",
    "2011 ) , indicating thermal cooling of burst - induced phenomena .",
    "x - ray pulsation properties of the underlying neutron stars are usually affected by these events . in particular , the pulsed amplitude of their x - ray emission was enhanced in the burst tails ( see related references cited above ) .",
    "we present clearly noticeable pulsations from during the tail in figure  [ bat_xrt_lc ] .",
    "amplified pulsations were also the case in its 2006 extended burst tails ( gavriil et al .",
    "it is possible that the leading burst in this event caused a trapped fireball , similar to the agent responsible for the oscillating tails of giant flares ( thompson & duncan 1995 ; 2001 ) , but on a much smaller scale .",
    "the periodic modulations are then naturally observed when the cooling fireball came into the field of view of _ swift_. it is important to note that sustaining an optically thick pair plasma fireball would require much higher temperature than about 1 kev .",
    "however , the required energy budget might not necessarily need to be supplied from the burst , but might be readily available , as is a persistent emitter of bright hard x - rays . alternatively , a burst - induced heating of a portion of the neutron star surface , a hotspot , could also account for the enhanced pulsations in the decaying x - ray flux enhancement .",
    "we found that many bursts during the flux enhancement align near the maximum of the neutron star spin phase .",
    "extensive investigations for phase alignment of magnetar bursts were mostly inconclusive , except for xte j1810 - 197 : in that case energetic bursts ( identified as spikes of @xmath110s duration ) were seen separated from each other by 5.54 s , the spin period of the source ( woods et al . 2005 )",
    ". however , peak - phase aligned x - ray bursts are difficult to accommodate , either with a localized fireball scenario or with a hotspot .",
    "it is possible that they might arise from a different mechanism at a similar location on the neutron star surface , such as the leading burst driven instabilities causing small scale magnetar bursts near the magnetic pole of the neutron star .",
    "next generation space telescopes with large collecting area and x - ray polarimetry capability could solve the puzzle of whether the enhanced x - ray pulsations and peak aligned x - ray bursts are driven by the same mechanism , or they are caused by somehow associated and spatially coincident different physical phenomena .",
    "is an active magnetar . besides its persistent emission of radiation from infrared to hard x - rays",
    ", it is also emitting energetic bursts .",
    "its unpredictable burst active episodes repeat on a timescale from about six months to @xmath10 years .",
    "bursts from this source morphologically resemble typical short bursts from magnetars , but less energetic compared to the bulk of magnetar bursts .",
    "the extended burst tail emission following a burst on the 2015 february 28 , has a thermal nature , cooling over a time - frame of several minutes .",
    "this behavior is similar to what has been observed previously from other magnetars , as well as from itself in 2006 . finally , we uncovered phase aligned x - ray bursts / spikes during the 2015 extended burst tail , which are likely associated to a contemporaneous but different physical phenomenon .",
