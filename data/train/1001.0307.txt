    "recently , the pamela satellite experiment has observed an excess in the positron fraction from 10 to 100 gev @xcite , which confirmed the previous hints from heat @xcite , caprice @xcite and ams-01 @xcite .",
    "the reports from atic balloon experiment showed a rapid rise of the total electron and positron flux at a range 300 - 800 gev@xcite with a peak at around 600 gev , which agreed with the ppb - bets results@xcite .",
    "more recently , the fermi - lat @xcite and the hess @xcite cherenkov experiments have released their results for the sum of electron and positron flux . although they did not fully confirm the previous results reported by the atic experiment , both the measurements indicated excesses over the expected background , which suggests the presence of extra sources for the @xmath2 spectra . besides the astrophysical explanations for @xmath2 anomalies by some nearly sources like pulsars and supernova remnants , the dark matter ( dm ) annihilation or decay is one of the most interesting explanation from particle physics .",
    "the pamela , atic , and fermi - lat anomalies may be a consequence of dm particle annihilating mainly into lepton final states .",
    "however , if the dark matter is generated thermally , the annihilation cross section obtained from the observed relic density is significantly lower than that required by the current data .",
    "one has to resort to a large boost factor ( about @xmath3 ) to explain the observed large positron flux .",
    "note that the most probable boost factor from the clumpiness of dm structures is estimated to be less than @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "the large boost factor may come from nonperturbative sommerfeld enhancement @xcite or breit - wigner enhancement @xcite .",
    "an other possibility is that the dm particle may slightly decay , and dominantly decay into leptons @xcite . in this case",
    "the bound from the dm relic density is relaxed .",
    "the current data require that the lifetime of dm particle should be of the order @xmath5s ) .",
    "if the mass of dm particle is very heavy , it may first decay into some lighter intermediate states rather than directly into standard model ( sm ) particles .",
    "an interesting intermediate state might be @xmath0 triplets , as it is known in many models that they may carry nonzero lepton numbers , and do not couple to quarks directly .",
    "this leptophilic feature can naturally account for the pamela results on both the excesses of positrons and the absence of large anti - proton flux .",
    "the stability of the dm particle is usually protected by imposing extra discrete symmetries . in our previous work @xcite , we have shown that the fundamental symmetries of quantum field theory such as parity ( @xmath6 ) and charge - conjugation ( @xmath1 ) can be used to stabilize the dm particle .",
    "we have explicitly demonstrated that in a left - right ( lr ) symmetry model with @xmath6 and @xmath7 only broken spontaneously , a gauge singlet scalar with odd @xmath7 parity can be automatically stable without imposing any extra discrete symmetries .    motivated by the recent experimental results , we consider in this work the possibility of dm particle decay by adding soft @xmath8violating interactions into our previous model , which will result in the decay of dm particle with @xmath0 triplet scalars as intermediate states .",
    "the decays of the triplets into the sm gauge boson pairs @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 as well as the sm - like higgs bosons @xmath12 are all suppressed by the smallness of the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the left - handed triplet as required by the tiny neutrino masses .",
    "thus the triplets decaying into quarks indirectly through these states are strongly suppressed .",
    "if the reported positron excess indeed originates from dm particle decay through the intermediate @xmath0 triplets , the possible associating signals such as the high energy neutrinos and gamma - rays are expected .",
    "this is because the neutral and singly charged components of the triplets couple to neutrinos in the same way as the doubly charged components couple to charged leptons .",
    "the final state leptons may generate high energy gamma - rays through inverse compton scatterings ( ics ) and final state radiations ( fsr ) , which is common to many dm models .",
    "in this model the doubly and singly charged components of the triplet can also produce extra gamma - rays through virtual internal bremsstrahlung ( vib ) , which gives additional contributions to the gamma - ray spectrum at very high energy region .    in this work",
    "we first show how the dm particle decay caused by the soft @xmath1-violating interactions can naturally explain the observed excess of the positron and electron excesses , and then focus on the cosmic - ray signals associated with dm particle decay through intermediate @xmath0 triplets in a lr symmetric model with two higgs bidoublets @xcite . after exploring the typical parameters which can explain the current pamela as well as fermi - lat or atic data , we present predictions for the flux of neutrinos and gamma - rays .",
    "we find that the predicted neutrino - induced muon flux can be significantly larger than the case in which dm particle only directly decays into charged leptons .",
    "the energy spectrum of diffuse gamma - rays can be enhanced by the vib processes from internal charged triplets as well .",
    "although the analysis is done in a particular model , the conclusions are generally valid for other models which involve @xmath0 triplets as intermediate states , such as the dm models in connection to the type ii seesaw mechanism for neutrino masses ( see , e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] , we discuss the main features of the model and focus on the decay of dm particle induced by the soft @xmath1-breaking terms . in sec . [",
    "sec : propagation ] , we calculate the dm decay signals which includes the positron fraction , total flux of electron and positron , neutrino - induced muon flux and high energy gamma - ray flux . the results are summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we begin with a brief review of the lr model with two higgs bidoublets described in ref .",
    "the model is a simple extension to the minimal lr model @xcite , which is based on the gauge group @xmath13 .",
    "the left- and right - handed fermions belong to the @xmath0 and @xmath14 doublets respectively .",
    "the higgs sector contains two higgs bidoublets @xmath15 ( 2,@xmath16,0 ) , @xmath17 ( 2,@xmath16,0 ) , a left(right)-handed higgs triplet @xmath18 ( 3(1),1(3),2 ) , and a gauge singlet @xmath19(0,0,0 ) with the following flavor contents @xmath20 the two triplets @xmath21 are responsible for breaking the left - right symmetry at high energy scale and generating small neutrino masses through the seesaw mechanism .",
    "the introduction of higgs bidoublets @xmath15 and @xmath17 accounts for the electroweak symmetry breaking and overcome the fine - tuning problem in generating the spontaneous @xmath7 violation in the minimal lr model .",
    "meanwhile it also relaxes the severe low energy phenomenological constraints .",
    "the gauge singlet @xmath19 is relevant to the dm candidate .",
    "the kinematic terms for the scalar fields are given by @xmath22 % + \\mbox{tr}[(d_\\mu\\chi)^\\dagger ( d^\\mu\\chi ) ] + \\mbox{tr}[(d_\\mu \\delta_l)^\\dagger(d^\\mu \\delta_l ) ] + ( \\phi \\leftrightarrow \\chi , l \\leftrightarrow r ) \\ ; , % + \\mbox{tr}[(d_\\mu \\delta_l)^\\dagger(d^\\mu \\delta_l ) ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23-i g ' b_\\mu \\delta_{l } \\;.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] due to constraints from low energy phenomenology , the mixing between @xmath24 and @xmath25 is rather small .",

    "the terms proportional to even powers of @xmath36 can be rewritten in terms of @xmath41 and @xmath35 .",
    "the absence of odd power term of @xmath36 means that @xmath42 is a potential dm candidate .",
    "the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) scheme is to realize the breaking pattern @xmath43 . after the ssb ,",
    "the higgs multiplets obtain nonzero vevs @xmath44 where @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are in general complex , and @xmath49 gev represents the electroweak symmetry breaking scale .",
    "the value of @xmath48 sets the scale of lr symmetry breaking which is directly linked to the right - handed gauge boson masses @xmath50 .",
    "it is required that @xmath51 does not develop a vev directly from @xmath30 , namely @xmath7 is not broken by the singlet sector .",
    "it follows that after the ssb , although @xmath6 and @xmath7 are both broken , there is a residual @xmath52 type of discrete symmetry on @xmath51 in the gauge singlet sector , which is induced from the original @xmath7 symmetry .",

    "thus the hierarchies in neutrino masses , sm gauge boson masses and the right - handed gauge boson masses require that @xmath77 an important consequnce of the smallness of @xmath47 is that the couplings between left - handed triplets and sm gauge bosons @xmath78 and @xmath79 are strongly suppressed , as @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath82 couplings are all proportional to @xmath47 .",
