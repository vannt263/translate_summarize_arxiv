    "cyg  x-2 is a typical low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) z - source ( see van der klis 2000 for a review ) exhibiting features which can be attributed to z - sources : z - shape color - color diagram ( ccd ) , 15 - 60 hz quasi - periodic oscillation ( qpo ) frequencies for horizontal branch oscillations ( hbo ) and 5 - 20 hz frequencies for normal - flaring branches ( n / fbo ) .",
    "large numbers of strong hbo and n / fbo frequencies have been found in power density spectrum ( pds ) of this source .",
    "one of the particular features of cyg  x-2 as a z - source is that the z - track undergoes secular changes ( evolution ) on the time - scale of days @xcite .",
    "there is still no consensus in the community on the nature of these changes .",
    "when considering the components of the x - ray spectrum rather than x - ray colors @xcite have demonstrated the clear correlation between khz qpos and spectral shape in neutron star ( ns ) lmxbs . when fitting the x - ray spectra of 4u  0614 + 09 and 4u  1608 - 52 with simple power laws , @xcite observed a correlation between the index of the power law and the qpo frequency , the larger the index , the higher the qpo frequency . on the other hand @xcite",
    "have shown that there is a one - to - one correlation between the flux of the blackbody ( bb ) component of the x - ray spectrum and the qpo frequency in 4u  0614 + 09 , it worth noting that no such correlation exists between the total x - ray flux and the qpo frequency .",
    "one can infer the disk mass accretion rate @xmath2 using the blackbody flux .",
    "combination of these qpo - index and qpo - bb flux correlations imply that the spectral index increases when @xmath2 increases .",
    "@xcite reviewed the broad band ( 0.1 - 200 kev ) spectral and timing observations of lmxbs performed by beppo - sax and rxte and discussed all of these aforementioned correlations in detail .",
    "@xcite , hereafter ts05 , suggested that black hole ( bh ) and ns binaries could be observationally distinguished by the correlation between the spectral indices and qpo low frequencies in the binary x - ray spectra .",
    "they reported that there was a correlation between the spectral indices and qpo frequencies in the ns binary ( the atoll - source ) 4u  1728 - 34 .",
    "ts05 implemented a thorough analysis of spectral and temporal properties of 4u  1728 - 34 using rxte data .",
    "they studied a spectral evolution of this source from hard spectra at low luminosities to soft spectra at high luminosities .",
    "they found that the hardest spectra are described by the sum of compton upscattering of the disk and ns surface soft photons .",
    "these spectra are very similar to the hard - state spectra of black hole candidates ( bhcs ) but they are softer ( @xmath3 for bhc , @xmath4 for ns ) as expected from the theory [ see , for example , @xcite ] . on the other hand the high luminosity soft state spectrum of 4u  1728 - 34",
    "consists of the sum of two blackbody - like components with color temperatures of about 1 kev and 2.2 kev respectively .",
    "the softer blackbody component is presumably related to the disk emission as the harder one is related to the ns compact photosphere emission .",
    "recently @xcite , hereafter p06 , confirmed this spectral evolution picture of ns sources using a sample of twelve ns bright low - mass x - ray binaries observed by integral [ high - energy ( @xmath5 kev ) observations ] .",
    "their sample comprises the six galactic z - sources and six atoll - sources , four of which are bright gx bulge sources while two ( h  1750 - 440 and h  1608 - 55 ) are weaker in the 2 - 10 kev range . comparing their results with those obtained by @xcite on 4u  1728 - 34 , p06 were able to identify four main spectral states for ns lmxbs ( see fig . 4 in p06 )",
    ": very soft state ( e.g. gx  3 + 1 ) , intermediate state ( e.g. , gx  5 - 1 ) , hard / power - law ( pl ) state ( h  1750 - 440 and h  1608 - 55 ) and low / hard state ( 4u  1728 - 34 ) .         in p06",
    "the low / hard state spectra are described by thermal comptonization with plasma temperature @xmath6 30 kev and thomson optical depth @xmath7 1 .",
    "the hard / power - law ( pl ) state spectra , as suggested by the name , show simple pl - like emission .",
    "the intermediate state spectra are characterized by the presence of a thermal comptonization component with spectral parameters similar to those of the soft state plus additional pl - like emission above @xmath8 30 kev .",
    "the soft state spectra are described by a single thermal comptonization component with low @xmath9 and high @xmath0 .",
    "the power - law state was also found by piraino et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , hereafter psfk , in 4u  0614 + 09 .",
    "the steep extended power laws , which indices were about @xmath10 , were interpreted by psfk as thermal comptonization of low energy photons on electrons having a very high temperature @xmath11 greater than 220 kev and small optical depth @xmath0 less than 0.2 .",
    "however one should realize that the real information in the 4u  0614 + 09 data is the values of the power - law indices about 2.4 but small optical depth and high electron temperature are a matter of interpretation in terms of the thermal comptonization model ( see  6 for more discussion of this small optical depth interpretation and its relation to non - detection of pulsations from 4u  0614 + 09 ) .",
    "it is important to emphasize that some of these sources do not undergo the spectral transition from the hard to soft states through the intermediate state but they only evolve within a particular state . using rxte data @xcite , hereafter btk07 ,",
    "have found that sco  x-1 is always in the high luminosity soft state for which the photon index @xmath12 is between 3.3 and 4.1 .",
    "the photon spectral model is described by the thermal comptonization component with low-@xmath9 , ranging from 2.5 to 3 kev and high-@xmath0 with values at about @xmath13 along with a strong 6.4 kev iron line .",
    "these results suggest that cooling of compton cloud ( cc ) is dictated by the strong soft emissions coming from the disk and from the neutron star .",
    "the photons and plasma are almost in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other .",
    "the cc plasma temperature is very close to the color temperature of the blackbody - like emission of the ns compact photosphere ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore btk07 demonstrate the distinct presence of a correlation between qpos and photon index in sco  x-1 similar to the previously reported correlation in 4u  1728 - 34 .",
    "this observed correlation of khz frequencies with photon index in sco  x-1 ( btk07 , fig .",
    "3 ) leads to the conclusion that the cc contracts when the source evolves to the softer states .",
    "@xcite noted that there is a similar correlation between the fast time variability and the source position along the track described in the color diagram ( its color ) for both high and low luminosity sources .",
    "in this paper we suggest that in high - luminosity lmxbs like cyg  x-2 and sco  x-1 _ index - qpo correlations _ should be similar because the physical processes producing the power and photon spectra are similar in these sources .",

    "in fact , the pulsated ns emission is attenuated by scattering off electrons of the compton cloud and the detected signal consists of two components , the directed and the scattered ones .",
    "the directed component is exponentially attenuated with attenuation factor @xmath87 where @xmath88 is optical path along the line of sight .",
    "thus even the cc optical depth is between 1 and 2 in the hard state of atoll - sources the optical path along the line of sight can be a factor 2 - 3 more , i.e. @xmath89 and consequently the directed component would be barely visible .",
    "on the other hand the pulsations of scattered component is completely is washed if the cc optical depth more than two and the cc geometrical thickness is order of few times of ns radius [ see @xcite ] .",
    "@xcite recently tried to revisit this compton scattering scenario to explain lack of pulsations in the majority of lmxbs .",
    "they use archival data of rxte observations of three representative lmxbs ( gx  9 + 9 , gx  9 + 1 , and sco  x-1 ) covering the full range of atoll / z phenomenology .",
    "they argue that the optical depth of the compton region ( corona ) in these sources does not exceed @xmath90 unless the electron temperature is very low , @xmath91 kev .",
    "ultimately @xcite conclude that lack of coherent pulsations can not be attributed to the electron scatterings because such small values of the optical depth ( that they inferred ) are by far insufficient to suppress the pulsations .    on the contrary",
    "if the electron temperature of the corona is low as that is in our scenario ( see fig .",
    "3 , top ) then the compton cloud is optically thick [ see fig .",
    "3 , bottom , @xcite , @xcite ] .",
    "in addition if the ns surface is surrounded by the quasi - spherical cloud ( which is presumably the case for the sources in the high / soft state ) then the ns pulsations are completely washed out .",
    "the low frequency oscillations that are detected from cyg  x-2 and sco x-1 can be also be considered as observational evidence of the presence of the bounded compton cloud in these sources ( see details in tsa07 ) .",
    "an other interesting example of the small optical depth interpretation was presented by psfk . as we emphasize in introduction section that the real information in the 4u  0614 + 09 data is a detection of the extended power laws which indices are about 2.4 but small optical depth and high electron temperature are a matter of interpretation in terms of the thermal comptonization ( tc ) model .",
    "in fact , btk07 show that the spectral index @xmath92 is a reciprocal of the comptonization parameter @xmath93 which is a product of average number of scattering @xmath94 and average fractional energy change per scattering @xmath95 . as for tc @xmath96 ,",
    "i.e independent of @xmath0 whereas for the converging ( diverging ) flow ( cf ) @xmath95 is inverse proportional to @xmath0 ( see e.g. laurent & titarchuk 2007 ) .",
    "it implies that even when the cf @xmath94 is large , the @xmath93-parameter ( or @xmath12 ) can saturate to some low value because @xmath94 is proportional to @xmath0 in this case .",
    "in contrast , in the tc case one needs to keep @xmath0 at small values in order to have values of @xmath93 about @xmath97 since the high energy cutoff requires @xmath98 kev ( see psfk ) .",
    "in fact , @xmath99 and @xmath100 because @xmath101 in the tc case .",
    "then one obtains a value of @xmath102 which is similar to that using the tc model ( see psfk ) .",
    "titarchuk & farinelli 2007 ( in preparation ) made extensive calculations of the hydrodynamics of the transition layer ( compton cloud ) presumably located between the neutron star surface and geometrically thin keplerian disk .",
    "they found that in the innermost part of the transition layer ( tl ) of the size about ns radius the matter is almost in free - fall regime .",
    "probably the hard spectra detected from 4u  0614 + 09 are rather formed in this tl region than they are a result of the thermal comptonization in some optically thin corona surrounding neutron star .",
    "the real optical depth of the compton cloud ( cc ) can be large given that the 4u  0614 + 09 observations show a relatively high temperature of the blackbody component of about 1.5 kev .",
    "such a high temperature is definitely related to the ns surface temperature and it can be only in the state when mass accretion rate , and consequently cc optical depth , is high .",
    "thus , it is not by chance , we do not see pulsations from 4u  0614 + 09 because they are presumably blocked by optically thick compton cloud .",
    "we demonstrate a definite correlation of qpos with photon index in cyg x-2 which has no sign of the index saturation at high values of qpo frequency .",
    "the similar correlations were previously reported in four nss : 4u  0614 + 09 , 4u  1608 - 52 , 4u  1728 - 34 and sco  x-1 .",
    "the observed correlations of qpo frequencies with photon index in the ns soft state lead us also to conclude that the comptonization efficiency is suppressed in the high / soft state of cyg  x-2 , namely the disk and ns photons reach almost an equilibrium with surrounding plasma of the compton cloud .    in the bh high / soft state conversely",
    ", the index saturates with qpo frequency ( actually with mass accretion rate ) . in terms of the physics of photon - plasma interaction",
    "this implies that photons are trapped in converging flow i.e. they are driven by the flow across an event horizon rather than emerging .",
    "the bulk motion comptonization ( upscattering ) efficiency saturates with the mass accretion rate .",
    "we acknowledge the referee for his / her important questions and for the constructive suggestions which improve of the paper quality . this research has made use of data obtained through the high energy astrophysics science archive research center online service , provided by the nasa / goddard space flight center .",
