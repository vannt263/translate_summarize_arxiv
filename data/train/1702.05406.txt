    "[ fig:1 ] , the coldest patches are those on the top of the structures ( class t ) .",

    "highest temperatures are observed on the vertical surface patches with an increase in temperature from the top to the bottom .",
    "this pattern results from a decreased view of open space ( `` sky '' ) for vertical patches and reflections from the base patches close to the bottom of the elevated structures .",
    "the base patches temperature decays away from the structures which is clearly visible for the low structures of model m1 .",
    "the non - central unit cells show colder surface patches towards the edges of the surface due to their proximity to the boundaries which enables an increased emission of heat .",

    "panels ( c ) and ( d ) show the distributions for the vertical patches only , again for @xmath97 and @xmath98 , respectively , with different colors labeling now equidistant height intervals over the base plane in which the patches are located .",
    "a general feature of all models is that the surface temperatures increase from top patches over base patches to vertical patches .",
    "it is interesting to note that only for model m1 there is a clear separation of base and vertical temperature ranges whereas for m2 and m3 the base temperatures fall into the mid or lower range of vertical temperatures .",
    "another interesting observation is that the vertical temperature distribution has a single peak for models m1 and m3 , particularly in the latter , and a two - peak structure for model m2 .",
    "we interpret this as a consequence of the proximity of two cuboids of different height .",
    "this view if supported by the variation of the distribution of vertical temperatures with height , see fig .",
    "[ fig:3](c ) and ( d ) : only the peak at smaller temperatures contains patches of the largest height class h4 , and hence must represent mainly the taller cuboid . in generel ,",
    "models m1 and m2 display little overlap between the temperatures corresponding to different height intervals while model m3 shows less separated temperature ranges for the height intervals .",
    "this is presumably related to the continuous range of vertical surface patch orientations for cylinders as compared to cuboids .",
