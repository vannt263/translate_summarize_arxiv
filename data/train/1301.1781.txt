    "this paper is a survey of the joint work with xavier gmez - mont and luis giraldo spread over some 15 years .",
    "we give a formula for calculating the index of singularities of real vector fields on singular hypersurfaces .",
    "some partial results are published in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .    in @xcite , gmez - mont , seade and verjovsky studied vector fields tangent to a complex hypersurface with isolated singularity .",
    "they introduced a notion of index , now called gsv - index at a common singularity of the vector field and the hypersurface ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it is a kind of relative version of the poincar - hopf index at a singularity .",
    "a natural question is how can one calculate this index .",
    "complex case was studied first .",
    "it was solved by gmez - mont in his seminal paper @xcite .",
    "gmez - mont s formula expresses the gsv index via dimensions of certain local algebras .",
    "the gsv index can be generalized to the real case .",
    "more precisely , depending on the side of the singular hypersurface , there are two gsv indices .",
    "real case , is more difficult than the complex case since in the real case a simple singularity can carry the index @xmath6 or @xmath7 , whereas in the complex case all simple singularities count as @xmath6 .    in the absolute real case eisenbud ,",
    "levine and khimshiashvili expressed the poincar - hopf index of a vector field in terms of the signature of a bilinear form .",
    "our result in the relative real case expresses the gsv - index of a real vector field on a singular variety as a sum of certain terms .",
    "each term is a signature of a non - degenerate bilinear form on some local algebra .",
    "our proof has two essential ingredients : on one hand gomez - mnt s result in the singular complex case and on the other hand the eisenbud , levine , khimshiashvili s result in the real absolute case .",
    "let us recall first the definition of the poincar - hopf index of a singularity of a real vector field in @xmath5 .",
    "let @xmath8 be a smooth vector field in @xmath5 having an isolated singularity at the origin @xmath9 .",
    "one can identify the vector field @xmath1 with a mapping @xmath10 .",
    "taking a small sphere @xmath11 around the origin , the vector field @xmath1 induces a map @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the unitary sphere in @xmath5 .",
    "the poincar - hopf index @xmath14 of the vector field @xmath1 at the origin is defined as the degree of @xmath15 .",
    "that is , @xmath16 is the number of pre - images of generic points taken with orientation .",
    "let @xmath1 be the vector field @xmath17 in @xmath18 having a node at the origin and let @xmath19 be the vector field @xmath20 having a saddle at the origin .",
    "then @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "consider the complex @xmath23-dimensional space @xmath24 , with complex coordinates @xmath25 and a complex vector field @xmath1 of the form @xmath26 .",
    "we can identify @xmath24 with @xmath27 . with this identification a holomorphic vector field on @xmath24",
    "becomes a smooth real vector field on @xmath27 and one can apply the previous definition of the poincar - hopf index @xmath14 to a singularity of a holomorphic vector field . note that not every smooth real vector field on @xmath27 comes from a holomorphic vector field on @xmath28 . by holomorphy , a holomorphic vector field seen as a map preserves orientation .",
    "hence the index of a singularity of a holomorphic vector field is necessarily positive .",
    "let @xmath29 and let @xmath30 and @xmath31 be vector fields in @xmath32",
    ". then @xmath21 and @xmath33 .    in the complex case ,",
    "the poincar - hopf index is simply the multiplicity .",
    "one counts how many points are hidden at the singularity at the origin .",
    "let now @xmath34 be a germ of an analytic function .",
    "then @xmath2 is a germ of a hypersurface at @xmath35 .",
    "we say that a vector field defined in a neighborhood of @xmath36 is a vector field tangent to @xmath37 , if there exists an analytic function @xmath38 such that    @xmath39    the function @xmath38 is sometimes called the _ cofactor _ of @xmath1 .",
    "assume first that @xmath36 is a regular point of @xmath4 .",
    "then the variety @xmath37 is smooth in a neighborhood of @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath40 be a chart of @xmath37 in a neighborhood of @xmath35 .",
    "we assume moreover that the orientation of @xmath41 is positive .",
    "the chart @xmath40 transports the vector field @xmath1 to @xmath42 .",
    "one then applies the usual definition of the poincar - hopf index .",
    "thus we define the _ relative poincar - hopf index _ @xmath43 of a vector field tangent to a hypersurface , relative to the surface .",
    "it is easy to verify that the definition is independent of the choices .",
    "if @xmath44 is a germ of holomorphic function instead , @xmath45 is a regular point of @xmath4 , @xmath46 is a complex hypersurface , and @xmath1 a holomorphic vector field tangent to @xmath37 , one transports as previously the vector field to @xmath24 and defines the _ relative poincar - hopf index _ @xmath43 in the complex case .",
    "note that in the relative complex case , just as in the absolute complex case , the relative index is always positive .",
    "let as previously , @xmath47 be a germ of a holomorphic function .",
    "assume now that @xmath45 is an isolated singularity of @xmath4 .",
    "then @xmath48 is a complex hypersurface with isolated singularity at @xmath35 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a holomorphic vector field defined in a neighborhood of @xmath49 tangent to @xmath37 .",
    "that is , relation holds . in @xcite , gmez - mont , seade and verjovsky",
    "defined what is now called the gsv - index of a vector field tangent to a singular variety at the singularity @xmath50 .    in order to formulate the definition ,",
    "let us first recall that the holomorphic function @xmath47 having an isolated singularity at the origin defines a milnor fibration : @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is a small ball around the origin .",
    "denote @xmath53 .",
    "for @xmath54 small , close enough to zero , all fibers @xmath55 are isotopic .",
    "note that the vector field @xmath1 is not necessarily tangent to the fibers @xmath55 , for @xmath54 .",
    "we modify x slightly , giving a @xmath56 vector field @xmath57 tangent to a fiber @xmath55 , for @xmath54 close to zero .",
    "we assume moreover that the restriction of the vector field @xmath57 on @xmath58 is isotopic to the restriction of the vector field @xmath1 to @xmath59 see @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the gsv - index can be defined by the formula    @xmath60    it follows from the poincar - hopf theorem that the definition is independent of all choices .",
    "indeed , the poincar - hopf theorem says that the right - hand side of is the euler characteristic @xmath61 up to some correction term given by the behavior of any vector field @xmath57 on @xmath58 .",
    "note that by the milnor fibration theorem all regular fibers @xmath55 , @xmath54 , have the same euler characteristic .",
    "moreover , the behavior of any vector field in @xmath57 on @xmath58 is the same as the behavior of @xmath1 on @xmath59 .",
    "hence the correction term is independent of the choices .    for an equivalent topological definition",

    "hence , the dimension of the multilocal algebra obtained after deformation @xmath63 of @xmath1 is equal to the dimension of the local algebra @xmath162 before the deformation .",
    "this permits to extend continuously the bilinear form @xmath163 from the algebra @xmath123 to its deformation . by nondegeneracy of the form @xmath163",

    "let us note that complex zeros of @xmath63 come in pairs .",
    "one verifies that the contribution to the signature of each pair is equal to zero .",

    "the law of conservation of number ( in the real case ) for the formula @xmath165 follows .    the final step in proving the formula in the case @xmath93 odd is to adjust the constant @xmath166",
    "this is difficult in the odd case .",
    "we will come back to it in subsection [ 7.4 ] .      in the @xmath93 even case theorem [ xavier ]",

    "one has the highest codimension for the hamiltonian vector field @xmath173 given by , when @xmath174 .",
    "note that in this case the two algebras @xmath136 and @xmath99 coincide and @xmath175 .    in this case",

    "the hamiltonian vector field @xmath173 has no zeros on @xmath53 , for @xmath54 .",
    "hence @xmath177 . on the other hand @xmath178 , as @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "it follows that no correction term has to be added to @xmath181 in order to obtain the formula for @xmath0 .",
    "we explain here why @xmath182 in the @xmath93 even case and not in the odd case .",
    "note first that the index of a vector field in the ambient space is an even function if the dimension @xmath93 of the ambient space is even and is an odd function if @xmath93 is odd .",
