    "we make predictions for antiproton - nucleus collisions at the @xmath0 threshold . this measurement will be possible at the future antiproton - nucleus experiment at the gsi  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate that in these collisions the cross section for the nondiagonal transition @xmath8 can be measured .",
    "we account for the dependence of the cross sections on energy , and the dependence of the elastic cross section on the momentum transfer .",
    "the charmonium production in @xmath1 collisions at the @xmath0 threshold is well suited to measure the genuine charmonium - nucleon cross sections . at higher energies",
    "formation time effects makes the measurement of these cross sections more difficult  @xcite .",
    "these cross sections and the cross section for the analysis of charmonium production data at sps - energies  @xcite . at collider energies ,",
    "i.e.  at rhic and lhc , the formation time effects will become dominant and charmonium states will be produced only far outside of the nuclei  @xcite .",
    "however , measurements of the genuine charmonium - nucleon cross sections as well as the cross section for the nondiagonal transition @xmath9 are also important at collider energies for the evaluation of the interaction of charmonium states with the produced secondary particles .",
    "in the semiclassical glauber - approximation the cross section to produce a @xmath0 in an antiproton - nucleus collision is    @xmath10    in this formula , @xmath11 is the impact parameter of the antiproton - nucleus collision , @xmath12 is the number of protons in the nuclear target , @xmath13 is the coordinate of the production point of the @xmath0 in beam direction , and @xmath14 is the nuclear density .",
    "@xmath15 is the cross section to produce a @xmath0 in an antiproton - proton collision .",
    "@xmath16 is the inelastic antiproton - nucleus collision .",
    "@xmath17 is the inelastic @xmath0-nucleon cross section .    all the factors in eq .",
    "( [ antipapsiprim ] ) have a rather direct interpretation .",
    "the first exponantial gives the probability to find an antiproton at the coordinates @xmath18 , which accounts for its absorption , and @xmath19 is the probability to create a @xmath0 at these coordinates .",
    "the factor @xmath20 accounts for the fact that close to the threshold the antiproton can produce a @xmath0 only in a collision with a proton but not with a neutron .",
    "the second gives the probability that the produced @xmath0 has no inelastic collision in the nucleus , i.e.  that it survives on the way out of the nucleus .",
    "similarly , in the semiclassical glauber - approximation the cross section to subsequently produce a @xmath7 in an antiproton - nucleus collision is @xmath21    in fig .",
    "[ antipa ] we used five sets of parameters . `` normal '' means that the inelastic antiproton - nucleon cross section is @xmath2250  mb , the inelastic cross section of the @xmath0 is @xmath237.5  mb , the inelastic cross section of the @xmath7 is @xmath240  mb , and the cross section for the nondiagonal transition @xmath9 is @xmath250.2  mb .",
    "the other sets differ by only one of these parameters each :    * in `` @xmath26-absorption '' @xmath27  mb . * in `` large @xmath0 absorption '' @xmath28  mb . * in `` small nondiagonal '' @xmath29  mb . * in `` large nondiagonal '' @xmath30  mb .",
    "_ one can see that the result depends much more strongly on the nondiagonal cross section than on the absorption cross sections of the @xmath7 and the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , this process is well suited to measure the nondiagonal cross section .",
    "_     is shown for 5 different sets of parameters ( see text for further details ) . shown",
    "are the nuclear targets o , s , cu , w , and pb . the lines are just to guide the eye . ]",
    "the cross section for the production of @xmath0 that does nt undergo an inelastic rescattering is @xmath31 is given by eq .",
    "( [ antipapsiprim ] ) . the cross section for the production of @xmath0 , whether they have subsequent inelastic scatterings or not is given by @xmath32 assuming that the @xmath4 channel is the only possible final state in inelastic collisions ( i.e.  the @xmath33 channel as well as the nondiagonal transition is neglected as a correction here ) , the fraction of the initially produced @xmath0 that ends up in the @xmath4 channel is @xmath34 here we neglected the final state interactions of @xmath4 as they may only effect the momentum distribution of @xmath4 since the @xmath4 energy is below the threshold for the process @xmath35 . for this reaction",
    "the @xmath4 would need an energy of 4.2  gev in the rest frame of the proton , while it has in average less than 3  gev .",
    "the change of the momentum distribution of @xmath4 would provide unique information about the @xmath36 interaction and could be a promising method for forming charmed hypernuclei .",
    "obviously eq .",
    "[ lamdacfrac ] is valid also for @xmath5 production .",
    "the fraction for the @xmath0 and the @xmath7 threshold is depicted in fig .",
    "[ lambdac ] .",
    "_ one can see that the result depends strongly on the inelastic cross section of the @xmath7 and the @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , this process is well suited to measure the inelastic cross section .",
    "_     divided by the number of produced @xmath7 and @xmath0 respectively states at the threshold of @xmath7 and @xmath0 production respectively .",
    "shown are the nuclear targets o , s , cu , w , and pb . the lines are just to guide the eye . ]",
    "it was shown that the future @xmath1-experiments at the gsi are well suited to measure genuine @xmath7 nucleon and @xmath0 nucleon cross sections , i.e. the inelastic and the nondiagonal ( @xmath37 ) cross sections .",
