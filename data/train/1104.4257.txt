    "many so - called `` xyz '' charmonium - like states such as @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 have been observed by belle , cdf , d0 and babar collaborations  @xcite during the past few years . despite the similar production mechanism",
    ", some of these structures do not easily fit into the conventional charmonium spectrum , which implies other interpretations such as hybrid mesons , heavy meson molecular states etc .",
    "might be responsible for these new states  @xcite@xcite .",
    "a natural idea is that some of the `` xyz '' states near two heavy meson threshold may be bound states of a pair of heavy meson and anti - heavy meson .",
    "actually , rujula _ et al .",
    "_ applied this idea to explain @xmath18 as a p - wave @xmath19 bound resonance in the 1970s  @xcite .",
    "tornqvist performed an intensive study of the possible deuteron - like two - charm - meson bound states with the one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential model in ref .",
    "recently , motivated by the controversy over the nature of @xmath15 and @xmath20 , some authors proposed @xmath15 might be a @xmath21 bound state  @xcite .",
    "our group have studied the possible molecular structures composed of a pair of heavy mesons in the framework of the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model systematically  @xcite .",
    "there are also many interesting investigations of other hadron clusters  @xcite .",
    "the boson exchange models are very successful to describe nuclear force  @xcite . especially the deuteron is a loosely bound state of proton and neutron , which may be regarded as a hadronic molecular state",
    ". one may wonder whether a pair of heavy baryons can form a deuteron - like bound state through the light meson exchange mechanism . on the other hand ,",
    "the large masses of the heavy baryons reduce the kinetic of the systems , which makes it easier to form bound states .",
    "such a system is approximately non - relativistic .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to study whether the obe interactions are strong enough to bind the two heavy baryons ( dibaryon ) or a heavy baryon and an anti - baryon ( baryonium ) .",
    "a heavy charmed baryon contains a charm quark and two light quarks .",
    "the two light quarks form a diquark .",
    "heavy charmed baryons can be categorized by the flavor wave function of the diquark , which form a symmetric @xmath22 or an antisymmetric @xmath23 representation . for the ground",
    "heavy baryon , the spin of the diquark is either @xmath24 or @xmath25 , and the spin of the baryon is either @xmath26 or @xmath27 .",
    "the product of the diquark flavor and spin wave functions of the ground charmed baryon must be symmetric and correlate with each other .",
    "thus the spin of the sextet diquark is @xmath25 while the spin of the anti - triplet diquark is @xmath24 .    the ground charmed baryons are grouped into one antitrpilet with spin-1/2 and two sextets with spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 respectively .",
    "these multiplets are usually denoted as @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in literature @xcite . in the present work , we study the charmed dibaryon and baryonium systems , i.e. @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath31 and @xmath11 .",
    "other configurations will be explored in a future work .",
    "we first derive the effective potentials of these systems .",
    "then we calculate the binding energies and root - mean - square ( rms ) radii to determine which system might be a loosely bound molecular state .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "we present the formalism in section [ form ] . in section [ const ] ,",
    "we discuss the extraction of the coupling constants between the heavy baryons and light mesons and give the numerical results in section [ numer ] .",

    "the isospin of the @xmath56 is @xmath24 .",
    "because strong interactions conserve isospin symmetry , the effective potentials do not depend on the third components of the isospin .",
    "for example , it is adequate to take the isospin function @xmath57 with @xmath58 when we derive the effective potential for @xmath59 , though the wave function @xmath60 indeed gives the same result . in the following ,",
    "we show the relevant isospin functions used in our calculation ,",
    "@xmath61    we are mainly interested in the ground states of dibaryons and baryonia where the spatial wave functions of these states are symmetric .",
    "the tensor force in the effective potentials mixes the @xmath62 and @xmath63 waves .",
    "thus a physical ground state is actually a superposition of the @xmath62 and @xmath63 waves .",
    "this mixture fortunately does not affect the symmetries of the spatial wave functions . as a mater of fact , for a dibaryon with a specific total spin @xmath64",
    ", we must add the spins of its components to form @xmath65 first and then couple @xmath65 and the relative orbit angular momentum @xmath66 together to get @xmath67 .",

    "but the tenser force only mixes states with the same @xmath62 and @xmath75 . in our case",
    "we must deal with the @xmath70-@xmath72 mixing . after stripping off the isospin function ,",
    "the mixed wave function is @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in short , for the spatial wave functions , we will discuss the ground states in @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and the latter mixes with @xmath72 .    finally , we point out that the @xmath78 and @xmath62 of states in eq .",
