    "this memoir has two main goals .",
    "first , we develop some foundations on what we call `` sheaves on graphs '' and their invariants .",
    "second , using these foundations , we resolve the hanna neumann conjecture of the 1950 s .",
    "although our foundations of sheaves on graphs seem likely to impact a number of areas of graph theory , the theme that is common to most of this memoir is the hanna neumann conjecture ( or hnc ) . both this conjecture and a strengthening of it , known as the strengthened hanna neumann conjecture ( or shnc ) have been extensively studied ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these conjectures are usually stated as an inequality involving free groups , although both conjectures have well - known reformulations in term of finite graphs . in this memoir",
    "we prove both conjectures , using the finite graph reformulations , reducing both to the vanishing of a homology group of certain sheaves on graphs .",
    "this work was originally written and posted to arxiv.com as two separate articles .",
    "the first aritcle , @xcite , contains the foundational material on sheaves of graphs , and comprises chapter  1 of this manuscript .",
    "the second article , @xcite , resolves the shnc ( and hnc ) , and chapter  2 of this manuscript consists of this material .",
    "this manuscript is easier to read than both articles separately , in that redundant definitions have been discarded , and references in chapter  2 to material in chapter  1 are now more specific . yet , as we now explain , chapters  1 and 2 are largely independently of one another , and chapter  1 , the foundations of sheaves on graphs , is of interest beyond the hnc and shnc . to explain this interest , let us recall a bit about sheaf theory and its connection to discrete mathematics .    among many ( co)homology theories of topological spaces ,",
    "the sheaf approach has many advantages .",
    "for one , it works with non - hausdorff spaces , as done first by serre in algebraic geometry with the zariski topology ( see @xcite ) .",
    "grothendieck s sheaf theory of @xcite defined a notion of a sheaf on very general spaces now called `` grothendieck topologies . ''",
    "while grothendieck s work has had remarkable success to cohomology theories in algebraic geometry , we believe that graph theory and combinatorics may greatly benefit by studying very special grothendieck topologies formulated from finite , discrete structures . in particular , we will resolve the shnc using a simple , finite grothendieck topology associated to any finite graph .",
    "another aspect of sheaf cohomology is that it vastly generalizes the cohomology of a space .",
    "each sheaf has injective resolutions that give cohomology groups .",
    "when the sheaf is take to be the `` structure sheaf '' of the space , we recover the cohomology groups of the space . however , there are many sheaves apart from the structure sheaf , and the resulting cohomology groups can represent a variety of aspects of the space .",
    "in particular , each open subset of a space , @xmath2 , has an associated sheaf on @xmath2 that reflects many properties of @xmath2 ; we will use such sheaves in our proof of the shnc .",
    "one fundamental aspect of any ( co)homology theory is that it expresses relations between related ( co)homology groups in terms of exact sequences .",
    "furthermore , any exact sequence yields a triangle inequality between the dimensions or ranks of any three consecutive elements .",
    "in @xcite we began an investigation into applying such inequalities to complexity theory , in particular to construct formal complexity measures to obtain lower bounds for formula size .",
    "similarly , in this manuscript , we prove the shnc from such an inequality .    in chapter  1",
    "we define a sheaf on a graph with no reference to sheaf theory , rather as a collection of vector spaces indexed on the vertices and edges of the graphs along with certain `` restriction '' maps .",
    "we add that one can view such a sheaf as a simple genelization of an incidence matrix of a graph ; it follows that sheaves on graphs can be viewed as a vast generalization of classical algebraic graph theory ( of adjacency matrices , laplacians , etc . ) .",
    "however , our sheaves on graphs can also be viewed as the very special case of sheaves of finite dimensional vector spaces on a simple grothendieck topology that we associate to a finite graph . in the case where the graph has no self loops ,",
    "the grothendieck topology is equivalent to a simple topological space .",
    "chapter  1 begins with a simple definition of sheaves on graphs and some examples .",
    "however , quickly we begin to study `` limits '' of betti numbers of these sheaves .",
    "the most remarkable invariant that we study in chapter  1 is the _ maximum excess _ of a sheaf .",
    "we give a number of strong results regarding the maximum excess , and the related `` twisted '' homology .",
    "these are related to the @xmath0 betti numbers first studied by atiyah ( see @xcite ) ; however , the results we obtain in the case of finite graphs , especially regarding the maximum excess , seem especially strong .    to summarize the above few paragraphs",
    ", here are some reasons that chapter  1 is of interest independent of the hnc :    1 .",
    "sheaf theory on graphs generalizes algebraic graph theory and , therefore , may strengthen its applications ; 2 .   our results on maximum excess give tools to study certain graph invariants such as the `` reduced cyclicity '' and number of `` acyclic components ; '' 3 .",
    "our results on the maximum excess of sheaves may indicate what one can expect of limits of betti numbers on more general structures ; 4 .",
    "any results on sheaves on graphs may give new results and examples of what to expect on more general finite grothendieck topologies , such as those of possible interest to complexity theory ; 5 .",
    "any results on betti numbers of sheaves may yield new inequalities on other integers that can be viewed as akin to betti numbers on some discrete grothendieck topology .",
    "of course , despite the above reasons for interest in sheaves on graphs , the reader will see that chapter  1 is largely developed with an eye toward the reduced cyclicity and the hnc .",
    "let us summarize aspects of chapter  2 , our proof of the shnc , in general terms .",
    "this will serve to highlight our approach to this problem via sheaves on graph , which is very different than previous approaches .",
    "we use a graph theoretic formulation of the shnc that involves the reduced cyclicity of three graphs .",
    "however , using what we call `` galois graph theory '' ( of @xcite , but also @xcite ) , the shnc amounts to showing that the reduced cyclicity of one graph is less than that of another graph , and both of these graphs admit a natural map to the same cayley graph .",
    "we wish to emphasize that , to the best of our knowledge , our manuscript represents the first application of galois graph theory to other parts of graph theory .",
    "that is , galois graph theory occurs for its own interest ( in @xcite ) and for its connection to number theory ( in @xcite ) .",
    "however , in this manuscript we make essential use of galois graph theory to two independent questions not obviously related to galois graph theory .",
    "first , in chapter  1 we use galois graph theory to show that maximum excess scales under pulling back by a covering map ; first we prove this for galois morphisms , making essential use of the symmetry in galois theory , and then we deduce the general case by the normal extension theorem of galois graph theory .",
    "second , galois graph theory is the basis of our construction of @xmath1-kernels , upon which our approach to the hnc and shnc is based , and the symmetry of these @xmath1-kernels is used constantly in chapter  2 .",
    "let us return to the shnc , and recall that exact sequences give triangle inequalities on the dimensions of consecutive terms .",
    "the reduced cyclicity is a type of limiting first betti number .",
    "hence , one graph has smaller reduced cyclicity than a second graph provided that there is a surjection from the first graph to the second , such that the kernel of this surjection has vanishing limiting first betti number .",
    "unfortunately there is no such graph surjection in the graphs that arise from the shnc .",
    "however , both graphs admit a natural map to the same cayley graph , and hence can be viewed as sheaves on this cayley graph ( much as open subsets of a topological space have associated sheaves ) .",
    "remarkably , there is a surjection from the first graph to the second when viewed as sheaves .",
    "the kernel of such a sujection ( generally a sheaf ) will be called a @xmath1-kernel , and the shnc turns out to be implied by the vanishing limiting first betti number , or maximum excess , of an appropriate collection of @xmath1-kernels .",
    "we emphasize that the @xmath1-kernels that we build seem almost forced upon us , once we look for the surjections described above . however , it does not seem to be an easy question , essentially of linear algebra , to determine whether or not these @xmath1-kernels have vanishing maximum excess .",
    "in fact , if we define a @xmath1-kernel as the kernel of any surjection of the two graphs of interest , then there are @xmath1-kernels whose maximum excess does not vanish .    to complete the proof of the shnc",
    ", we shall show that the maximum excess of a `` generic '' @xmath1-kernel vanishes .",
    "this main idea is that there is a symmetry property of the `` excess maximizer , '' which implies that maximum excess of a generic @xmath1-kernel must be a multiple of the order of an associated galois group ( the group associated to the cayley graph mentioned above ) .",
    "from this point one knows that if the generic maximum excess does nt vanish , it would be large ; one can then use two different inductive arguments to show that this is impossible .    for the reader interested only in a proof of the hnc",
    ", we mention that can read its proof in chapter  2 while skipping most of the material in chapter  1 .",
    "indeed , chapter  2 is based on the `` stand alone '' paper , @xcite , written without explicit reference to homology theory , using only sheaves and maximum excess .",
    "so to read chapter  2 , one needs the definitions of sheaves and maximum excess , of section  [ se : shmain ] , the galois graph theory of section  [ se : shgalois ] , and the submodularity of the excess in section  [ se : shme ] . aside from these results , the proof in @xcite needed the fact that the maximum excess is a `` first quasi - betti number , '' which relies on the main ( and most difficult ) theorem of chapter  1 .",
    "however , we have recently found a variant of the proof in @xcite which does not require this fact . hence one can read a complete proof of the hnc and snhc in this manuscript , without most of chapter  1 and any reference to homology .",
    "however , as explained in chapter  2 , homology still gives valuable insight into the proof .",
    "we mention that as of writing @xcite , mineyev has informed us of his independent proof of the hnc and shnc , first using hilbert modules ( @xcite , based on @xcite ) , and then using only combinatorial group theory ( @xcite ) .",
    "his approaches seem very different from ours .",
    "we wish to thank laurant bartholdi , for conversations and introducing us to the shnc , and avner friedman , for comments on a draft of this manuscript .",
    "we thank luc illusie , for an inspiring discussion regarding our ideas involving sheaf theory , homology , and the shnc ; this discussion was a turning point in our research .",
    "we wish to thank for following people for conversations : goulnara arjantseva , warren dicks , bernt everitt , sadok kallel , richard kent , igor mineyev , pierre pansu , and daniel wise .",
    "finally , we thank alain valette and the centre bernoulli at the epfl for hosting us during a programme on limits of graphs , where we met bartholdi and pansu and began this work .",
    "the main goal of this chapter is to introduce a notion of a sheaf on a graph and to establish some foundational results regarding the homology groups of such sheaves and related invariants . after developing some general points we shall focus on a remarkable invariant of a sheaf that we call the _",
    "maximum excess_.    the _ maximum excess _ of a sheaf arises naturally as a `` limit '' of betti numbers , akin to @xmath0 betti number defined by atiyah .",
    "although such limits have been studied in many contexts , we are able to show some compellingly strong results about these limits in the case of sheaves on graphs .",
    "first , the maximum excess can be defined , with no reference to homology theory , in a manner that makes it resemble quantities seen in matching theory or expander graphs .",
    "second , this definition amounts to the maximum of an `` excess '' function that is supermodular ; this gives additional structure to the maximum excess that is not apparent from homology theory .",
    "third , for any given sheaf , the limit is attained from `` twisted betti numbers '' by passing to a finite cover ( as opposed to an infinite limit of covers ) .",
    "our motivation for studying the maximum excess and certain betti numbers arose from studying an important graph invariant that we call the _ reduced cyclicity _ of a graph .",
    "this invariant arises in one formulation of the much studied hanna neumann conjecture of the 1950 s ( see @xcite ) ; in chapter  2 we shall use the results of this chapter to prove this conjecture .",
    "moreover , our methods will prove what is known as the strengthened hanna neumann conjecture ( or shnc ) of @xcite .",
    "our sheaf theory on graphs is based on the sheaf theory of grothendieck ( see @xcite ) , built upon what are now known as grothendieck topologies . in the special case when the graph has no self - loops ,",
    "the sheaf theory we describe is equivalent to the sheaf theory on certain topological spaces ( see @xcite ) . the basic definition of sheaves on graphs and their homology groups are special cases of theory developed in @xcite and are probably special cases of situations arising in the fields of toric varieties and quivers .",
    "however , in this chapter we study a special case of this general notion of sheaf theory , proving especially strong theorems particular to sheaves on graphs and obtaining new theorems in graph theory . in this process",
    "we also introduce new invariants in sheaf theory  such as `` maximum excess '' and `` twisted homology''and establish theorems about these invariants that may become useful to sheaf theories in other settings .    in this chapter",
    "we explore primarily those aspects of sheaf theory directly related to our future study of the shnc , namely general properties of the maximum excess . however , we believe sheaf theory is a concept fundamental to graph theory , and that there will probably emerge other applications of these ideas .",
    "one reason for this belief is that many areas in graph theory , such as expanding graphs , work with the adjacency matrix of a graph .",
    "any sheaf on a graph , @xmath3 , has an adjacency matrix ( and incidence matrix , laplacian , etc . ) with many of the properties that graph adjacency matrices have .",
    "a graph has a particularly simple sheaf that we call its `` structure sheaf . ''",
    "the adjacency matrix of the structure sheaf turns out to be the adjacency matrix of @xmath3 . in this way the adjacency matrix of a graph , and all of traditional algebraic graph theory , can be generalized to sheaf theory ; the sheaf theory , given its more general nature and expressiveness , may shed new light on traditional algebraic graph theory and its applications .",
    "new graph theoretic inequalities arise in our sheaf theory out of `` long exact sequences , '' analogous to long exact sequences that appear in virtually any homology theory .",
    "indeed , relations between different homology groups are often expressed in exact sequences , and in any exact sequence of vector spaces , the dimensions of three consecutive elements satisfy a triangle inequality .",
    "it is such triangle inequalities that inspire and form the basis of our approach to the shnc .",
    "one remarkable aspect of our sheaf theory is that it adds `` new morphisms '' between graphs . in other words , consider two graphs , @xmath4 and @xmath5 that each admit a morphism to another graph , @xmath3 .",
    "it is possible to associate with each @xmath6 a sheaf , @xmath7 , over @xmath3 , that contains all the information present in @xmath6 .",
    "any @xmath3-morphism from @xmath4 to @xmath5 gives rise to a morphism of sheaves , from @xmath8 to @xmath9 ; however , there are sheaf morphisms from @xmath8 to @xmath9 that do not arise from any graph morphism . for example",
    ", there may be a surjection from @xmath8 to @xmath9 when there is no graph theoretic surjection @xmath10 .",
    "some such `` new surjections '' are crucial to our proof of the shnc ; the kernel of such `` new surjections '' give a type of sheaf that we call a _",
    "@xmath1-kernel _ , which is the basis of our approach to the shnc . said otherwise , for any graph , @xmath3 , there is a faithful functor from the category of `` graphs over @xmath3 '' to the category of `` sheaves over @xmath3 ; '' however this functor is not full , and some of the `` new morphisms '' between graphs over @xmath3 , viewed as sheaves over @xmath3 , ultimately yield new concepts in graph theory needed in our proof of the shnc .",
    "this chapter will focus on four types of invariants of sheaves : ( 1 ) homology groups and resulting betti numbers , ( 2 ) twisted homology groups and resulting twisted betti numbers , ( 3 ) the maximum excess , and ( 4 ) limiting twisted betti numbers .",
    "let us briefly motivate our interest in these invariants and describe the main theorems in this chapter .",
    "this discussion will be made more precise , with more background , in section  [ se : shmain ] .",
    "our first type of invariant , homology groups of sheaves and resulting betti numbers , will not involve any difficult theorems .",
    "the main novelty of this type of invariant is in its definition ; it is chosen in a way that it has appropriate properties for our needs and can express some traditional invariants of a graph ; these invariants include its euler characteristic and the traditional zeroth and first betti numbers . in sheaf theory ,",
    "usually sheaf cohomology based on the global section functor is a central object of study ; however , these cohomology groups do not yield the invariants of interest to us in this chapter . instead",
    ", our homology groups are based on global cosections ; i.e. , our homology groups are essentially ext groups in the first variable , where the second variable is fixed to be the structure sheaf .",
    "the shnc conjecture can be reformulated in graph theoretic terms , involving a more troubling graph invariant , @xmath11 , of a graph , @xmath3 , which we call the _ reduced cyclicity _ of @xmath3 .",
    "the reason this graph invariant is troubling is that its usual definition seems to require that we know how many connected components of @xmath3 are acyclic , i.e. , are isolated vertices or trees . prior to this paper , all non - trivial techniques we know to bound @xmath11 either presuppose something about the number of acyclic components of @xmath3 , or else they overlook such components ; as such , previous results on the reduced cyclicity usually either require special assumptions or give results that are not sharp .",
    "our second set of invariants , the twisted homology groups and their dimensions , i.e. , the twisted betti numbers , give @xmath12 as the first twisted betti number of a certain sheaf on @xmath3 , for any graph , @xmath4 , with a graph morphism to @xmath3 .",
    "as such , the long exact sequences arising in twisted homology give the first sharp relations between values of @xmath1 ; however , these relations usually involve sheaves and not just graphs alone .",
    "let us sketch the idea of why reduced cyclicity is a special case of a twisted betti number .",
    "in this chapter we observe that @xmath11 is the limit of @xmath13 $ ] over `` generic abelian coverings maps , '' @xmath14 , where the degree , @xmath15 $ ] , of the covering map tends to infinity . it",
    "is well known that for abelian covering maps @xmath14 , we can recover spectral properties of the adjacency matrix of @xmath16 by working with that of @xmath3 and `` twisting its entries , '' i.e. , multiplying certain entries by roots of unity that appear in the characters of the underlying abelian group .",
    "so we form `` twisted '' homology groups by `` generically twisting '' a sheaf , with twists that are parameters or indeterminates , and compute that the reduced connectivity , @xmath11 , equals the first `` twisted '' betti number of the structure sheaf of @xmath3 .",
    "this gives a generalization of the definition of @xmath1 from graphs to sheaves , and the resulting twisted betti numbers satisfy triangle inequalities coming from the long exact sequences in twisted homology .    another promising fact about twisted betti numbers is that , via the theory of long exact sequences , one can reduce the shnc to the vanishing of the first twisted betti number of a collection of sheaves that we call @xmath1-kernels .",
    "the problem is that the twisted homology approach often seems to be the `` wrong '' way to view the reduced cyclicity , mainly for the following reason .",
    "the euler characteristic and reduced cyclicity have a remarkable scaling property under covering maps , @xmath17 , i.e. , @xmath18 twisted betti numbers do not always scale in this way ; this makes us suspect that the twisted betti number is not always a good generalization of the reduced cyclicity .",
    "the remedy comes in our third type of invariant , a single invariant of a sheaf that we shall define and call its _",
    "maximum excess_. this is an integer that one can define simply and with no reference to homology theory .",
    "its definition resembles combinatorial invariants arising in matching theory or expander graphs .",
    "the maximum excess of any sheaf is at most the first twisted betti number , and the two are equal on many types of sheaves , including all constant sheaves .",
    "hence the two concepts are related but not identical .",
    "furthermore , the shnc is implied by the ( _ a priori _ weaker ) vanishing maximum excess of @xmath1-kernels , and the maximum excess satisfies stronger properties that yield better bounds than what one would get for the first twisted betti number .",
    "so for the shnc , we largely abandon the idea of using twisted betti numbers to generalize @xmath1 from graphs to sheaves , and instead use the maximum excess .",
    "the problem is that to proof the shnc we require inequalities involving the maximum excess akin to those holding of betti numbers of homology theories via long exact sequences ; there is no _ a priori _ reason that such inequalities should hold .",
    "the main theorem of this chapter , theorem  [ th : shmain ] , says that for any fixed sheaf on a graph , @xmath3 , there is an integer , @xmath19 , with the following property : the maximum excess and first twisted betti number agree when the sheaf is `` pulled back '' along a covering map @xmath20 , provided that the girth of @xmath21 is at least @xmath19 .",
    "the main theorem implies that the maximum excess is a _ first quasi - betti number _ , meaning that the maximum excess satisfies certain triangular inequalities that we use to prove the shnc .",
    "however , in chapter  2 we see that a variation of our proof avoids these triangular inequalities .",
    "another view of our main theorem is that there exists a `` limit '' to the ratio of a twisted betti number of a pullback of a fixed sheaf along a graph covering to the degree of the covering .",
    "we shall call this limiting ratio a `` limiting twisted betti number , '' which is our fourth type of invariant .",
    "our main theorem can be rephrased as saying that the first limiting twisted betti number is just the maximum excess .",
    "it is easy to see that limiting twisted betti numbers satisfy the triangular inequalities we desire for the maximum excess ; hence proving the main theorem proves the desired inequalities for the maximum excess .",
    "however , as a limiting betti number , the maximum excess actually has associated homology groups whose dimensions divided by the covering degree approximate the maximum excess . and it may turn out that the homology groups themselves may contain useful information beyond knowing merely their dimension ; however , for our proof of the shnc , all that we need is the dimensions of these homology groups , i.e. , their betti numbers .",
    "lior silbermann has pointed out to us that our notion of limiting twisting betti numbers is a discrete analogue of `` @xmath0 betti numbers '' introduced by atiyah on manifolds ( @xcite ) ; the theory involved in the study of @xmath0 betti numbers ( see@xcite ) , especially the von neumann dimension of certain `` matrices '' of this theory , may already imply that our limiting twisting betti numbers do have a limit and that it is an integer ( because the fundamental group of a graph is a free group ) .",
    "so part of our results can be viewed as a very explicit type of @xmath0 or limiting betti number calculation ( for the very special case sheaves on graphs ) , that includes stronger information ; indeed , we give a simple interpretation of this number ( the maximum excess ) and a finite procedure for computing it ( pulling back to a graph of sufficiently large girth and computing a twisted betti number ) .",
    "we note that for the purpose of proving the shnc , the main results needed from this chapter are the definitions of a sheaf and its maximum excess , and a few properties we prove regarding the maximum excess .",
    "if we could prove such properties without using homology theory , we could study the shnc without homology theory .",
    "nonetheless , we find that twisted homology gives important intuition for the maximum excess ; for example , we first proved the shnc using twisted homology , and only discovered during the writing of @xcite that the proof could be written entirely in terms of the maximum excess .",
    "as we remark at the end of chapter  2 , there is a way to prove the shnc with no reference to homology theory , but this requires some extra combinatorial analysis ( namely appendix  a ) .",
    "the rest of this chapter is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "se : shmain ] we give precise definitions and statements of the theorems in this chapter . in section  [ se : shgalois ] we review part of what might be called `` galois theory of graphs '' that we will use in this chapter . in section  [ se : shsheaf ]",
    "we give the basic properties of sheaves and homology , pullbacks and their adjoints ; then we explain everything in terms of cohomology of grothendieck topologies ( this explanation will help the reader to understand the context of our definitions , but this explanation is not necessary to read the rest of this paper ) . in section  [ se : shtwist ] we define the twisted homology and compute the twisted homology of the constant sheaf of a graph ; we also interpret twisted homology in terms of abelian covers . in section  [",
    "se : shme ] we establish the basic properties of the maximum excess , including its bound on the twisted homology .",
    "the next two sections establish our main theorem . in section  [ se : shabel ] we show how to interpret elements of the first twisted homology group of a graph in terms of the first homology group of the maximum abelian covering of the graph . in section  [ se : shequal ] we prove theorem  [ th : shmain ] , that says that the first twisted betti number and the maximum excess agree after an appropriate pullback . in section  [",
    "se : shconclude ] we make some concluding remarks .      in this section",
    "we will define sheaves and all the main invariants of sheaves that we use in this paper .",
    "we will state the main theorem in this chapter , and state or describe other results in this chapter . in most of this paper we work with directed graphs ( digraphs ) , which makes things notationally simpler ; as we remark in section  [ se : shconclude ] , all this sheaf and homology theory works just as well with undirected graphs , although it is slightly more cumbersome if one wants to avoid orienting the edges .",
    "we will allow directed graphs to have multiple edges and self - loops ; so in this paper a directed graph ( or digraph ) consists of tuple @xmath22 where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are sets  the vertex and edge sets  and @xmath25 is the `` tail '' map and @xmath26 the `` head '' map . throughout this paper ,",
    "unless otherwise indicated , a digraph is assumed to be finite , i.e. , the vertex and edge sets are finite .    recall that a morphism of digraphs , @xmath27 , is a pair @xmath28 of maps @xmath29 and @xmath30 such that @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we can usually drop the subscripts from @xmath33 and @xmath34 , although for clarity we shall sometimes include them .",
    "recall that fibre products exist for directed graphs ( see , for example , @xcite , or @xcite , where fibre products are called `` pullbacks '' ) and the fibre product , @xmath35 , of morphisms @xmath36 and @xmath37 has @xmath38 @xmath39 @xmath40 for @xmath41 , respectively , there are natural digraph morphisms , @xmath42 called projection onto the first and second component , respectively , given by the respective set theoretic projections on @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "we say that @xmath45 is a covering map ( respectively , tale ) if for each @xmath46 , @xmath47 gives a bijection ( respectively , injection ) of incoming edges of @xmath48 ( i.e. , those edges whose head is @xmath48 ) with those of @xmath49 , and a bijection ( respectively , injection ) of outgoing edges of @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "if @xmath45 is a covering map and @xmath3 is connected , then the _ degree _ of @xmath47 , denoted @xmath15 $ ] , is the number of preimages of a vertex or edge in @xmath3 under @xmath47 ( which does not depend on the vertex or edge ) ; if @xmath3 is not connected , one can still write @xmath15 $ ] when the number of preimages of a vertex or edge in @xmath3 is the same for all vertices and edges .    given a digraph , @xmath3 , we view @xmath3 as an undirected graph ( by forgetting the directions along the edges ) , and let @xmath50 denote the @xmath51-th betti number of @xmath3 , and @xmath52 its euler characteristic ; hence @xmath53 is the number of connected components of @xmath3 , @xmath54 is the minimum number of edges needed to be removed from @xmath3 to leave it free of cycles , and @xmath55 let @xmath56 denote the connected components of @xmath3 , and let @xmath57 which we call the _ reduced cyclicity of @xmath3_.    for each digraph , @xmath3 , and field , @xmath58 , our sheaf theory is the theory of sheaves of finite dimensional @xmath58-vector spaces on a certain finite grothendieck topology ( see @xcite , where a grothendieck topology is called a `` site '' ) that we associate to @xmath3 ; this grothendieck topology has many properties in common with topological spaces ; in @xcite we have called these spaces _ semitoplogical _ , and have worked out the structure of their injective and projective modules , which allows us to compute derived functors ( e.g. , cohomology , ext groups ) , used in @xcite .",

    "it is well known that for @xmath156 coverings @xmath20 , or for any abelian covering , the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of @xmath21 can be computed from those of @xmath3 after `` twisting '' appropriately ; here `` twisting '' means multiplying the entries of @xmath3 s adjacency matrix by appropriate roots of unity , according to the characters of the `` galois group '' of @xmath21 over @xmath3 ( see section  [ se : shgalois ] ) . the same holds for homology groups .",
    "this leads us to a new homology theory , as follows .",

    "we give two reasons why we nonetheless use the maximum excess .",
    "first , the shnc is more directly related to the vanishing maximum excess of a certain sheaves we call @xmath1-kernels ; and this vanishing is weaker ( at least _ a priori _ ) than the vanishing of @xmath176 of the @xmath1-kernels .",
    "second , the euler characteristic , reduced cyclicity , and the maximum excess have a nice scaling property under `` pullbacks '' via covering maps , that @xmath179 does not share .",
    "this makes @xmath179 seem to be , at times , the `` wrong '' invariant for certain situations , like those arising in the shnc .",
    "let us discuss the above remarks in more precise terms .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath180 and one can show that equality holds if for each @xmath181 , @xmath63 is either zero or one dimensional . in particular , this holds for @xmath182 for any subgraph , @xmath183 of @xmath3 .",
    "however , there are sheaves , such as the `` unhappy 4-bundle , '' that we will soon describe , which have maximum excess zero but positive @xmath179 .",
    "the above inequality does show that if @xmath179 vanishes then so does the maximum excess ; in the case of the shnc and @xmath1-kernels this means that vanishing @xmath179 of @xmath1-kernels is at least as strong a condition as the shnc .",
    "we now describe a sheaf we call the _",
    "unhappy @xmath178-bundle_. it is a highly instructive example that illustrates a number of points on maximum excess and twisted homology .",

    "has the effect of exchanging open and closed sets , exchanging projectives and injectives , etc .",
    "let us briefly explain the name `` structure sheaf . ''",
    "generally speaking , in sheaf theory each topological space or grothendieck topology comes with a special sheaf called the `` structure sheaf '' that has several properties .",
    "one key property is that the `` global sections '' of a sheaf , @xmath60 , should reasonably be interpreted as the sheaf homomorphisms to @xmath60 from the structure sheaf .",
    "this makes `` global cosections , '' on which our homology theory is based , to be sheaf homomorphisms from @xmath60 to the `` structure sheaf . ''",

    "the general construction of @xmath515 is given in @xcite , expos i , proposition  5.1 ) .",
    "alternatively , the reader can simply take the @xmath515 that we describe and verify that it satisfies equation  ( [ eq : shadjoint ] ) .",
    "according to @xcite , expos i , proposition  5.1 , given a sheaf , @xmath60 , on a graph @xmath3 , i.e. , a presheaf on @xmath462 , the value @xmath519 for @xmath68 is determined as follows : form the category @xmath520 whose objects are @xmath521 with a morphism from @xmath522 to @xmath523 being a morphism @xmath524 in @xmath525 such that @xmath526 ; then the projection @xmath527 followed by @xmath60 gives a contravariant functor from @xmath520 to @xmath58-vector spaces , and we take the inductive limit in @xmath520 .",
    "it follows that if @xmath181 , then @xmath528 is category whose objects are @xmath529 where @xmath330 lies over @xmath337 , and @xmath530 is the identity at @xmath337 .",
    "it follows that @xmath531 if @xmath311 , then @xmath532 contains the following :    1 .",
    "@xmath533 for each @xmath314 over @xmath48 ; 2 .",
    "@xmath534 for every @xmath535 over an @xmath181 with @xmath536 , with @xmath205 the morphism from @xmath48 to @xmath337 given by the head relation ; and 3 .",

    "we claim that each object @xmath534 has a unique morphism in @xmath532 to an element @xmath533 , where @xmath537 in part  ( 2 ) and @xmath538 in part  ( 3 ) .",
    "so the inductive limit for @xmath539 can be restricted to the subcategory of objects in part  ( 1 ) , and we again get a direct sum : @xmath540 we leave it to the reader to verify that the restriction maps of @xmath541 are just the natural maps induced by @xmath60 .    now we see that @xmath542 with @xmath543 and @xmath544 identified under the isomorphism .",

    "however if @xmath17 is any digraph morphism , then @xmath105 determines a functor @xmath587 of the associated categories , and this functor is always `` target liftable , '' i.e. , for any morphism , @xmath130 , of @xmath462 and object , @xmath467 , in @xmath588 with @xmath589 being the target of @xmath130 , there is a morphism , @xmath590 , for @xmath588 whose target is @xmath467 and with @xmath591 . in @xcite",
    "we see that the `` target liftable '' property for @xmath105 ( or , more precisely , @xmath592 ) guarantees the isomorphism in the base change morphism ( actually @xcite speaks of the dual morphism @xmath593 and `` source liftable '' in the discussion after theorem  10.2 there ) .",
    "so if we , for example , spoke of graphs without requiring the edges to have both endpoints , then the simple example of @xcite shows that equation  ( [ eq : base_change ] ) would fail . of course , if @xmath16 is a subgraph obtained from @xmath3 by deleting any number of edges , then the inclusion @xmath105 ( or , more precisely , associated @xmath592 ) is not source liftable .",
    "hence `` target liftability '' ( and not `` source liftability '' ) should guide us in generalizing sheaves on graphs to more general discrete structures , if we wish to have similar theorems about analogues of the maximum excess being invariant under @xmath429 for tale @xmath105 .      in this section",
    "we describe a number of aspects of twisted homology , and give its relationship to the homology of pullbacks under abelian covers .",
    "we show that the first twisted betti number of the structure sheaf of a graph , @xmath3 , agrees with @xmath11 .",

    "we make a few remarks on the definitions .    in our definition of twists , for symmetry",

    "we conclude with a few remarks about the results in this chapter and ideas for further research .",
    "we would like to know how much we can prove about the maximum excess without appealing to homology theory .",
    "our main application of homology theory to the maximum excess was theorem  [ th : shmain ] , which implies that the maximum excess is a first quasi - betti number .",
    "but part of the proof of theorem  [ th : shmain ] , namely subsection  [ sb : main_theorem ] , involved a lot of direct reasoning about the maximum excess and short exact sequences .",
    "while we believe that the interaction between twisted homology and maximum excess is interesting , we also think that a treatment of maximum excess without homology might give some new insights into the maximum excess .",
    "the maximum excess gives an interpretation of the limit of @xmath1332 over covering maps @xmath233 for a sheaf , @xmath60 , of @xmath58-vector spaces on a digraph @xmath3 .",
    "it would be interesting to have an interpretation of @xmath1333 for any sheaves @xmath1334 ; the maximum excess gives the interpretation in the special case where @xmath382 is the structure sheaf , @xmath74 , in which case the ext groups reduce to ( duals of ) homology groups .",
    "we would also be interesting in generalizations of this to a wider class of settings , such as an arbitrary finite category , or an interesting subclass such as semitopological categories ( defined as categories where any morphism of an object to itself must be the identity morphism ; see @xcite ) .",
    "we would also be interested in knowing if there is a good algorithm for computing the maximum excess of a sheaf exactly , or even just giving interesting upper and lower bounds on it .",
    "this would also be interesting for certain types of sheaves .",
    "for example , it would be interesting to know classes of sheaves for which the first twisted betti number equals the maximum excess , in addition to edge simple sheaves of theorem  [ th : shedge_simple ] . notice that if @xmath3 is an undirected graph , all the discussion in this chapter goes through .",
    "either one can orient each edge and use the notation in this chapter , or just rewrite the notation in this chapter without reference to heads or tails .",
    "we see that the distinction between heads and tails is never essential . for example , rather than having twists at the tails of edges , we can have them at the heads and tails of edges . rather than define a canonical @xmath1335 to define homology ,",
    "we simply define homology as @xmath1336 which , by the injective resolution of @xmath74 , becomes the homology groups of @xmath1337 where each @xmath63 is really @xmath1338 where @xmath1339 is the diagonal in @xmath1340 ( see the discussion regarding equation  ( [ eq : shbetter_than_standard ] ) that appears just below equation  ( [ eq : shbetter_than_standard2 ] ) ) . choosing an identification of @xmath1341 with @xmath63 via @xmath1342 or @xmath1343 amounts to choosing an orientation for @xmath337 .",
    "the price of giving a `` canonical '' treatment of the undirected case , i.e. , avoiding edge orientations , is that one has to work with @xmath1341 instead of @xmath63 .",
    "howson , in @xcite , showed that if @xmath1344 are nontrivial , finitely generated subgroups of a free group , @xmath1345 , then @xmath1346 is finitely generated , and moreover that @xmath1347 hanna neumann , in @xcite improved this bound to what is now called the hanna neumann bound , @xmath1348 furthermore , she conjectured that one can remove the factor of @xmath500 in this bound , i.e. , that @xmath1349 this conjecture is now known as the hanna neumann conjecture ( or hnc )",
    ". one goal of this chapter is to prove the hnc .",
    "moreover , we shall prove a strengthened form of the conjecture , first studied by walter neumann in @xcite , known as the strengthened hanna neumann conjecture ( or shnc ) ; we will state the strengthened conjecture in the next section .",
    "[ th : shnc ] the hanna neumann conjecture and the strengthened hanna neumann conjecture hold .",
    "these conjectures have received considerable attention ( see @xcite ) .",
    "however , our proof uses very different methods from the previous papers .",
    "the main new idea in our approach to the shnc is to reduce it to the vanishing maximum excess of a type of sheaf we call a _",
    "@xmath1-kernel_. although this was described in the introduction to this paper , we can be a bit more precise here in view of the developments in chapter  1 .",
    "the shnc has a well - known reformulation in terms of an inequality involving the reduced cyclicity of graphs ; we shall reformulate this in terms of two graphs , the inequality now saying that the reduced cyclicity of one graph is less than that of another .",
    "this would follow if we can ( 1 ) realize both graphs as sheaves over some base graph , @xmath3 , ( 2 ) find a surjection of the first onto the second , and ( 3 ) show that the kernel ( a sheaf ) has vanishing maximum excess , in view of the fact that the maximum excess is a first quasi - betti number than reduces to the reduced cyclicity on a sheaves associated to graphs .",
    "we shall use galois graph theory to carry this out ; then the base graph , @xmath3 , will be a cayley graph ; the resulting kernels ( for the shnc ) will be called @xmath1-kernels .",
    "it is interesting to note the surjections we use for the shnc do nt generally exist as surjections of graphs , rather only as surjections of sheaves ; hence in representing graphs as sheaves , the `` additional morphisms '' we get are crucial to the construction of @xmath1-kernels and hence to our proof of the shnc .",
    "it turns out that some @xmath1-kernels have nonvanishing maximum excess ( at least if one defines @xmath1-kernels in a broad sense ) .",
    "however , any graph , @xmath183 , of interest to us in the shnc , will have a family of associated @xmath1-kernels , and we will prove that the generic maximum excess in this family is zero , for each @xmath183 . to do this",
    "we shall use galois theory and symmetry to argue that if this generic maximum excess does not vanish then it is large , i.e. , a multiple of the order of the associated galois group .",
    "then we will give an inductive argument , showing that if the generic maximum excess of @xmath1-kernels for @xmath183 is positive , then the same is true when we remove some edge from @xmath183 , provided that @xmath183 has positive reduced cyclicity . the base case of the induction , when @xmath183 has vanishing reduced cyclicity , is trivial to establish .",
    "hence each @xmath183 of interest in the shnc has a @xmath1-kernel of vanishing maximum excess , and this establishes in shnc .",
    "we emphasize that our proof of the shnc also uses theorem  [ th : shmain ] , that implies that the `` maximum excess '' is first quasi - betti number .",
    "however , it is quite possible that one can prove the inequalities we need for the shnc for without theorem  [ th : shmain ] .",
    "furthermore , in the conclusion to this chapter we will give a slight variant of our proof of the shnc that will avoid any reference to theorem  [ th : shmain ] or any homology theories ( although this would require the lengthy combinatorial argument of appendix  [ ap : elem ] ) .",
    "however , regardless of how we present the proof , we shall explain in the conclusion that the homology theory can provide valuable insight into the maximum excess .",
    "this paper shows that the shnc is not merely an attempt to improve an inequality by a factor of two ; our study of the shnc has lead to new ideas in sheaves on graphs that can be applied to graph theory .",
    "this came as a surprise to us at first , although it is perhaps less surprising in retrospect , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the hnc and shnc seem to describe a fairly fundamental question in group theory ( of how rank behaves under intersection ) .",
    "second , the shnc can be viewed as a graph theory question involving the reduced cyclicity , which is an interesting graph invariant ( e.g. it scales under covering maps ) .",
    "third , the shnc , viewed in terms of the galois graph theory , has a simple homological explanation , namely the vanishing of a limit homology group .",
    "the vanishing of ( co)homology groups has a vast literature and importance ; the shnc is an interesting and seemingly difficult result in the family of homology group vanishing theorems .",
    "fourth , lior silberman has pointed out to us that the reduced cyclicity is the discrete analogue of @xmath0 betti numbers ; the @xmath0 betti number was defined first by atiyah ( @xcite ) , and has been the subject of much surrounding the `` atiyah conjecture '' ( see @xcite ) .",
    "mineyev s article , @xcite , also makes a connection between the shnc and @xmath0 betti numbers .    at this point",
    "we can give more motivation for the use sheaf theory in this chapter , i.e. , why we do not just use graphs and their homology .",
    "our reformulation of the shnc begins by searching for a morphism involving the graphs of interest to the shnc . in order for this morphism to exist , to be surjective , and to have a kernel",
    ", we must work with more general objects than graphs .",
    "in many topological situations , the topological spaces are sufficiently `` robust '' that one does not have to generalize the objects .",
    "however , in non - hausdorff spaces , such as graphs or those in algebraic geometry , many geometric notions , such as `` connect two points with a path , '' `` form a cone , '' etc . , do nt make sense or are very awkward to implement .",
    "so for graphs we use sheaf theory , which is a simple ( co)homology theory that is adapted to our spaces , but general and expressive enough for appropriate surjections and kernels to exist . of course , it is possible that there are other reasonable frameworks that one could use instead of sheaves .",
    "the rest of this chapter is organized as follows . in section  [",

    "we finish this paper with a few concluding remarks .    in this chapter",
    "we have made no explicit reference to homology theories .",
    "in @xcite we have used the twisted homology to prove that the maximum excess is a first quasi - betti number ; hence the theorems in this paper ostensibly rely on homology theories .",
    "however , we think it quite possible that one may able to prove that the maximum excess is a first quasi - betti number directly , or give a direct proof of the inequalities we made use of in this paper .",
    "for example , if @xmath1879 is a monomorphism , then since the maximum excess is a first quasi - betti number we know that @xmath1880 but this inequality is clear from the subsheaf formulation of maximum excess in theorem  [ th : me_as_subsheaf ] .",
    "we remark that we first proved the shnc using twisted homology theory , and then rewrote our proofs to use only maximum excess .",
    "in fact , twisted homology theory offers some additional intuition regarding the maximum excess .",
    "twisted homology theory shows that ( after pulling back appropriately , see @xcite ) , the maximum excess can be interpreted as the dimension of a certain vector space of `` twisted harmonic one - forms '' of the sheaf .",
    "when this dimension is @xmath1881 , one can impose @xmath1882 linear conditions on the twisted harmonic one - forms and still have a @xmath1883 dimensional space of one - forms .",
    "this is how we view the variance in @xmath183 of @xmath1766 , as in the exact sequence of equation  ( [ eq : second_induct_exact ] ) : to take a space of one - forms on @xmath1766 and obtain a one - form in @xmath1764 , one has to impose @xmath1884 conditions on the one - forms , namely the conditions that they vanish on the edges in @xmath1535 that do not lie in @xmath1885 .",
    "of course , one has to pullback by an appropriate covering map to make this rigourous ( see @xcite ) , but all the edge counts and dimension counts scale appropriately under any covering .",
    "the @xmath257-th power kernels in this paper are subsheaves of the constant sheaf @xmath1886 .",
    "we believe that subsheaves of constant sheaves satisfy some stronger properties than general sheaves , regarding their homological invariants and maximum excess . it would nice to study this further .",
    "finally , we give a variant of our proof of the shnc that involves no homology theory and , in particular , avoids any use of theorem  [ th : shmain ] . as before , let @xmath183 be any subgraph of a cayley bigraph , @xmath3 , on a group , @xmath270 , and let @xmath58 be a field .",
    "first note that using appendix  [ ap : elem ] , we can show that if there is a @xmath1-kernel for @xmath1538 with vanishing maximum excess , then the shnc holds for all pairs @xmath1399 , with @xmath1350 any subgraph of @xmath3 ; appendix  [ ap : elem ] makes no use of homology or theorem  [ th : shmain ] .",
    "( appendix  [ ap : elem ] is a bit tedious and long , however avoids use of applying theorem  [ th : etale_contagious ] with @xmath133 being the maximum excess , and the proof that the maximum excess is a scaling first quasi - betti number used theorem  [ th : shmain ] . ) furthermore , if the generic maximum excess of @xmath1875 were greater than zero , then it would be at least @xmath1581 .",
    "then , by induction , for @xmath1887 we have that the generic maximum excess of @xmath1888 would be at least @xmath1889 , in view of theorems  [ th : generic_divisible ] and [ th : increase ] ( which makes no use of homology or theorem  [ th : shmain ] ) .",
    "but this is impossible for @xmath1890 , since the generic maximum excess of @xmath1891 is @xmath1892 , because a @xmath102-th power kernel is plainly just @xmath1893 , which has maximum excess @xmath1894 .",
    "hence the shnc holds for all pairs of subgraphs of cayley bigraphs , and hence holds for all pairs of tale bigraphs , by theorem  [ th : sub_bi_enough ] .",

    "so , once again , we have the shnc fails on @xmath1978 for some a proper subgraph , @xmath1974 , of @xmath1480 ; this contradicts the minimality of @xmath1480 .",
    "third , we claim that over each @xmath1984 there are at least @xmath1607 vertices in @xmath856 .",
    "indeed , if @xmath48 is incident upon some edge , @xmath337 , in @xmath1480 , then @xmath337 has at least @xmath1607 vertices in @xmath856 above it , so @xmath48 does as well . if @xmath48 is isolated in @xmath1480 , i.e. , incident upon no edge , then @xmath1480 consists of only @xmath48 , since @xmath1480 is connected ; but this contradicts the fact that @xmath1972 .    to @xmath856",
    "is associated a vertex family , @xmath186 , and an edge family , @xmath1899 .",
    "according to the three claims established in the previous three paragraphs , we have @xmath1985 clearly also @xmath1986 it follows that , as before @xmath1987 @xmath1988 using the fact that @xmath1480 is connected and @xmath1972 ( so that @xmath1989 ) .",
    "hence @xmath1934 , which shows item  ( 4 ) in the conclusion of the lemma .",

    "<S> our sheaf theory can be viewed as a vast generalization of algebraic graph theory : each sheaf has invariants associated to it  such as betti numbers and laplacian matrices  that generalize those in classical graph theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall use `` galois graph theory '' to reduce the strengthened hanna neumann conjecture to showing that certain sheaves , that we call @xmath1-kernels , have zero maximum excess . </S>",
    "<S> we use the symmetry in galois theory to argue that if the strengthened hanna neumann conjecture is false , then the maximum excess of `` most of '' these @xmath1-kernels must be large . </S>",
