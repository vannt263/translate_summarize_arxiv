    "zink introduced certain moduli spaces of quasi - isogenies of @xmath4-divisible groups with additional structures called the _ rapoport - zink spaces_. they constructed systems of rigid analytic coverings of them which we call the _ rapoport - zink towers _ , and established the @xmath4-adic uniformization theory of shimura varieties generalizing classical erednik - drinfeld uniformization . these spaces uniformize the rigid spaces associated with the formal completion of certain shimura varieties along newton strata .    using the @xmath0-adic cohomology of the rapoport - zink tower , we can construct a representation of the product @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the reductive group over @xmath7 corresponding to the shimura datum , @xmath8 is an inner form of it , and @xmath9 is the weil group of the @xmath4-adic field @xmath7 .",
    "it is widely believed that this realizes the local langlands and jacquet - langlands correspondences ( @xcite ) .",
    "classical examples of the rapoport - zink spaces are the lubin - tate space and the drinfeld upper half space ; these spaces were extensively studied by many people and many important results were obtained ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) . however",
    ", very little was known about the @xmath0-adic cohomology of other rapoport - zink spaces .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study cuspidal representations in the @xmath0-adic cohomology of the rapoport - zink tower for @xmath1 .",
    "let us denote the rapoport - zink space for @xmath1 by @xmath10 .",
    "it is a special formal scheme over @xmath11 in the sense of berkovich @xcite .",
    "let @xmath12 be the raynaud generic fiber of @xmath10 , that is , the generic fiber of the adic space @xmath13 associated with @xmath10 .",
    "using level structures at @xmath4 , we can construct the rapoport - zink tower @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an tale galois covering of rigid spaces with galois group @xmath16 .",
    "we take the compactly supported @xmath0-adic cohomology ( in the sense of @xcite ) and take the inductive limit of them .",
    "then , on @xmath17 ( here @xmath18 ) , we have an action of a product @xmath19 where @xmath8 is an inner form of @xmath20 .",
    "the main theorem of this paper is as follows :    [ thm : main - thm - introduction ] the @xmath1-representation @xmath21 has no quasi - cuspidal subquotient unless @xmath3 .    for the definition of quasi - cuspidal representations ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "note that since @xmath22 is 3-dimensional for every @xmath23 , @xmath24 unless @xmath25 .",
    "our proof of this theorem is purely local .",
    "we do not use global automorphic methods .",
    "the main strategy of the proof is similar to that of @xcite , in which the analogous result for the lubin - tate tower is given ; we construct the formal model @xmath26 of @xmath27 by using drinfeld level structures and consider the geometry of its special fiber . however , our situation is much more difficult than the case of the lubin - tate tower . in the lubin - tate case ,",
    "the tower consists of affine formal schemes @xmath28 , and we can associate it with the tower of affine schemes @xmath29 . in @xcite , the second author defined the stratification on the special fiber of @xmath30 by using the kernel of the universal drinfeld level structure , and considered the local cohomology of the nearby cycle complex @xmath31 along the strata . on the other hand ,",
    "our tower @xmath32 does not consist of affine formal schemes and there is no canonical way to associate it with a tower of schemes . to overcome this problem",
    ", we take a sheaf - theoretic approach . for each direct summand @xmath33 of @xmath34",
    ", we will define the complex of sheaves @xmath35 on @xmath36 so that the cohomology @xmath37 substitutes for the local cohomology of @xmath31 along the strata defined by @xmath33 in the lubin - tate case . for the definition of @xmath35",
    ", we use the @xmath4-adic uniformization theorem by rapoport and zink .",
    "there is another difficulty ; since a connected component of @xmath10 is not quasi - compact , the representation @xmath38 of @xmath1 is far from admissible .",
    "therefore it is important to consider the action of @xmath39 on @xmath38 , though it does not appear in our main theorem .",
    "however , the cohomology @xmath37 has no apparent action of @xmath39 , since @xmath39 does not act on the shimura variety uniformized by @xmath10 .",
    "we use the variants of formal nearby cycle introduced by the second author in @xcite to endow it with an action of @xmath39 . furthermore ,",
    "to ensure the smoothness of this action , we use a property of finitely generated pro-@xmath4 groups ( section [ sec : pro - p ] ) .",
    "in fact , extensive use of the formalism developed in @xcite make us possible to work mainly on the rapoport - zink tower itself and avoid the theory of @xmath4-adic uniformization except for proving that @xmath26 is locally algebraizable .",
    "however , for the reader s convenience , we decided to make this article as independent of @xcite as possible .",
    "the authors expect that the converse of theorem [ thm : main - thm - introduction ] also holds .",
    "namely , we expect that @xmath21 has a quasi - cuspidal subquotient if @xmath3 .",
    "we hope to investigate it in a future work .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section [ sec : pro - p ] , we prepare a criterion for the smoothness of representations over @xmath40 .",
    "it is elementary but very powerful for our purpose . in section [ sec : rapoport - zink - space ] , we give some basic definitions concerning with the rapoport - zink space for @xmath41 and state the main theorem .",
    "section [ sec : p - adic - unif ] is devoted to introduce certain shimura varieties related to our rapoport - zink tower and recall the theory of @xmath4-adic uniformization .",
    "the proof of the main theorem is accomplished in section [ section : proof ] .",
    "the final section [ sec : coh - corr ] is an appendix on cohomological correspondences .",
    "the results in the section are used to define actions of @xmath1 on various cohomology groups .",
