    "comparing with the hidden flavored heavy quarkonia such as charmonia and bottomonia , the heavy meson @xmath1 and its family , being explicitly double flavored , have not been thoroughly studied yet .",
    "the reason is that not sufficient experimental data about @xmath1 meson are available and the experimental data about @xmath12 meson ( the lowest one ) still are unavailable at all so far . @xmath1 and @xmath0 are composed of two different heavy flavors , so that unlike the production of the hidden flavored heavy quankonia , they can not be produced via a simple qcd process even at the hadron colliders . at @xmath13 colliders ,",
    "the production is even more suppressed because of absence of gluon fusion .",
    "the earlier work @xcite indicates that one can not expect to find @xmath1 in the cases with a luminosity and collision energy as that of the lep - i and ii owing to the production rate is small . as estimated by the authors of ref.@xcite , the meson @xmath1",
    "was first observed at a hadronic collider , tevatron @xcite .",
    "it is natural that one would expect to make a detailed study on the @xmath1 family at the lhc , because the available energy and luminosity are much higher than that of tevatron and the @xmath1-involved events should be thousand times more .",
    "however , the messy qcd background of the hadron colliders and the fact , that one can not control the total longitude momentum of the hadronic production , would contaminate the environment and make precise measurements on @xmath1 very difficult , and the observation on the other members of the @xmath1 family , i.e. the excited states of @xmath1 , almost impossible . in this aspect ,",
    "the proposed @xmath7 factory possesses obvious advantage over the hadronic colliders .",
    "@xmath7 factory , an @xmath14 collider with sufficiently high luminosity and running at @xmath7-boson pole , now is , as a phase of ilc or independently , considered seriously . even though the inclusive production @xmath15 where two pairs of heavy quarks ( @xmath16 and @xmath17 ) emerges from a hard gluon emission is suppressed , the high luminosity and the @xmath18-pole effects would greatly enhance the event - accumulation rate so that the @xmath1 meson and its excited states ( the other members of its family ) may be expected to be observed .",
    "thus if the luminosity is really high enough so the mesons @xmath1 and @xmath0 may be produced numerously , thus the magnetic dipole radiative transitions may be used to recognize the production of the excited states .",
    "in fact , lep - i did search for the @xmath1 meson and could not make any definite conclusion , such as that the @xmath1 meson has been observed , due to  low luminosity , so the small statistics for the events @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 being the ground state , its decay characteristics are completely distinct from the hidden flavored heavy - quarkonia .",
    "namely , the @xmath1 can only decay via weak interaction , and its lifetime has been carefully studied@xcite . whereas an excited state of @xmath1 meson must decay to a lower excited or the ground state via gluon ( strong interaction ) and/or photon ( electromagnetic interaction ) emissions , and it depends on the quantum number and the mass difference of the initial and final states .",
    "moreover , it is known that of the electromagnetic decays , the magnetic dipole @xmath19 transitions between the vector and pseudoscalar states play an important role .    in another work @xcite , we discussed the possibility of observing the radially excited states @xmath20 via processes @xmath21 at lhc and the @xmath7 factory .",
    "our calculation is based on the qcd multi - pole expansion method@xcite and we find that at the @xmath7 factory , it would be optimistic to observe the two - pion emission decays . on other aspect , the nearest member to @xmath1 in the family is the vector - boson @xmath22 . with possible and precise spin - spin interaction , one may estimate the splitting between @xmath23 and @xmath24 explicitly as @xmath25 mev , so that @xmath26 is forbidden by the energy - momentum conservation .",
    "thus the dominant decay mode of @xmath0 would be the magnetic dipole radiative decay @xmath27 .",
    "the decay @xmath28 is also governed by the electromagnetic process and the products @xmath13 would be easily caught by the detector as a clear signal . even though comparing with @xmath29 , its rate is suppressed by the three - body final phase space and an extra electromagnetic vertex , its observation",
    "may still be expected , because tracks of @xmath13 would be easier to be identified than that of a photon . definitely , we can gain more information about the @xmath0 and determine the mass splitting @xmath30 from the data which will be available at the @xmath7 factory .",
    "in ref.@xcite the authors explored radiative of @xmath31 in the bathe - salpeter(bs ) frameork@xcite . solving the bs equation",
    "one can obtain the wave functions and eigenvalues of the bound state . with the mandelstam formula@xcite",
    ", we calculate the transition matrix elements between the bound states with appropriate bs wave functions . concretely , in terms of the formula given in ref.@xcite we evaluate the transition matrix element of @xmath32 in the bs framework and extract the corresponding form factor @xmath33@xcite . with the form factor we are able to calculate the rate of @xmath27 .",
    "then we go on to evaluate the rate of @xmath28 where the photon is virtual . in view of the progress in the experimental aspect we also evaluate the transitions @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "our strategy is follows : first we solve the bs equation using the parameters given in ref.@xcite and get the spectra and the wave functions of @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively ; then with the formula obtained in ref.@xcite , we evaluate the transition matrix element of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 and extract the form factors @xmath43 ; using these form factors the rates of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 @xmath47 , @xmath48 @xmath49 , @xmath50 @xmath51 are eventually obtained .",
    "after the introduction , we present the theoretical formulae for calculating the rates of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54(@xmath55 ) , and then in sec.iii , we list our numerical results , the last section is devoted to our discussion and conclusion .",
    "in the bs framework the corresponding s - matrix element was formulated as @xcite @xmath59 where @xmath60 are the initial and daughter mesons , @xmath61 are their four - momenta and @xmath62 are their energies .",
    "@xmath63 is the momentum of the emitted photon , @xmath64 is its polarization vector and @xmath65 is its energy .    for the photon emission , the transition matrix element reads @xmath66 \\right.\\nonumber \\\\ & & + \\left . q_{2 } \\left [ \\bar{\\varphi'}^{++}_{\\mathcal{p}'}({q}_{\\mathcal{p}\\perp}-\\alpha_1{\\mathcal{p}'}_{\\mathcal{p}\\perp } ) \\frac{{\\mathcal{p}}\\!\\!\\!\\!\\slash}{m_{_{m_1}}}{\\varphi}^{++}_{\\mathcal{p}}({q}_{\\mathcal{p}\\perp } ) \\right]\\gamma_{\\mu } \\right\\}\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the charge carried by the quark(antiquark ) and other notations are listed in the appendix . in the processes",
    "@xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) , @xmath37 is a vector(@xmath70 ) and @xmath71 is a pseudoscalar(@xmath72 ) . due to the quantum numbers of the initial and final states",
    ", the transitions must be the nature of magnetic dipole , and there is only one form factor for the current matrix elements , namely as that in ref.@xcite the general form factor @xmath73 for @xmath74 is related to the current matrix element as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the four momentum of the virtual photon , @xmath77 is the polarization vector of the initial meson .",
    "@xmath73 can be extracted by evaluating the @xmath78 in eq.([2s2 ] ) . for real photon case",
    "@xmath79 is equal to 0 i.e. @xmath80 .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     with the wave functions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , @xmath81 gev we also can obtain the form factor @xmath73 for @xmath82 @xmath83 the emitted photon is an off - shell virtual one . for the transition @xmath9 , @xmath79 varies from @xmath84 to @xmath85 .",
    "we find the @xmath86 is almost a constant for our calculation accuracy , thus we set @xmath87 gev@xmath88 . integrating @xmath89 , we eventually obtain the width @xmath90 kev .",
    "the decay rates including the transitions : @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are listed in tab.[tab : modes ] .",
    "the family of @xmath1 meson is composed by two different heavy flavors : @xmath95 , the members production and decays are different from those for hidden - flavored heavy quarkonia , and the study of the @xmath95 system must be helpful in gaining insights into the hadron structure and the governing physical mechanisms .",
    "the two heavy quarks with different flavors can not annihilate into gluons , in addition to that the physics is rich , the influence of the relativistic effects is alleviated , and in the bs framework the instantaneous approximation seems to work well and the results are more reliable .",
    "even though the ground state , @xmath1 of @xmath96 , was found several years ago , its partner @xmath0 of @xmath97 has not been seen yet .",
    "fortunately lhc begins running and a @xmath7 factory is proposed , both of them will offer us optimistic opportunity to explore @xmath95 family , especially , @xmath0 .    in this work",
    "we mainly study the transitions @xmath98 and @xmath99 in the bs framework . writing the transition matrix element in the form of eq.([2s2 ] ) , we determine the form factor @xmath73 . in the calculation , we substitute the bs wave functions of initial and daughter mesons which are obtained by solving the bs equation . with the form factor @xmath73 , we evaluate @xmath10 and @xmath100 .",
    "when the mass of @xmath101 is 6.3308 gev and @xmath102 gev ( the measured value @xcite i.e. @xmath103 mev ) , we obtain @xmath104 kev and @xmath90 kev .",
    "the branching ratio of @xmath105 is three orders larger than that of @xmath9 , it means that the chance of observing @xmath105 seems to be superior to @xmath9 , however the positron and electron are charged and their tracks would be easier caught by the detector than a single photon , so that @xmath106 may still have its advantage for detection .",
    "we will rely on the monte - carlo simulation made by our experimental colleagues to make a judgement if at the @xmath7 factory it is a possible process to be measured .    since the value of @xmath105 is sensitive to the vary of @xmath107 we study the dependance of @xmath108to @xmath107 .",
    "our calculation indicates that the value of @xmath73 is not sensitive to the @xmath101 but @xmath10 is rather sensitive to the mass splitting @xmath107 .",
    "we calculate the decay width based on the bs framework , the obtained @xmath10 is accordant with that obtained in terms of the light - front - quark model by the authors of ref.@xcite . in the work of ref.@xcite",
    ", the authors used the variational method to fix the free parameters , whereas we determine the parameters by fitting the data for quarkonia .",
    "application of both the light - front quark model and the bs framework seems to be reasonable to deal with the radiative process , however , the difference of the two theoretical evaluated values may hint the feasibility of their application in this case .",
    "fortunately , the future experiments at the @xmath7 factory will make a more accurate measurement on @xmath10 and @xmath109 , and the data would judge which model to be more reasonable .",
    "we are expecting the new data .",
    "it is worth emphasizing again , even though at lhc , a large database on @xmath1 and @xmath0 will be available , but the complicated background makes a precise observation of @xmath110 rather difficult , so we lay our hope on the proposed @xmath7 factory .",
