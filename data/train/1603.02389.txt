    "precise measurement of cosmic distance has become a key targeted observable for probing the cause of cosmic acceleration . the cosmic acceleration has been confirmed by many observations @xcite , and our understanding of the universe has undergone a revolution with this new discovery .",
    "the standard model of the universe needs to be altered to either contain the yet unknown dark sector energy components , or to modify gravitational physics at large scale .",
    "the cosmic distance probes will provide us with the evolution of cosmic expansion from the epochs in which the cosmic expansion starts to be accelerated , and with the clues to include dark materials or dark gravity in order to complete the standard model of the universe .",
    "cosmic distances are observed by cosmic parallax , standard candles and standard rulers , but most methods suffer from their own systematics . among all of these diverse approaches , the standard ruler method is considered the most risk  free technique to probe cosmic distance .",
    "the acoustic peak structure of the baryon  photon fluid in the early universe is developed by the tension between gravitational infall and radiative pressure and imprinted on the last - scattering surface .",
    "the fossil record remain imprinted on the large - scale galaxy clustering even today ( hereafter bao * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the characteristic scale of the bao can be used as a standard ruler , which enables us to determine geometric distances for high-@xmath4 galaxies to great precision .",
    "previously geometric distances were determined by analysing simultaneously the clustering anisotropies over the bao scales .",
    "the galaxy clustering at the targeted area is observed in the redshift space ( hereafter rsd ) , which is contaminated by non  linear physics .",
    "the transformation between real and redshift space is intrinsically non  linear , in that the density perturbation and velocity fields are coupled together and evolve nonlinearly .",
    "the factorized formulation has been proposed to achieve the rsd theoretical model , which turns out to be the combination of non ",
    "separable linear squeezing effect and non  linear smearing effects caused by those higher order polynomials .",
    "the small scale distortion along the line of sight is caused by the randomness of the velocity field , called the finger of god ( hereafter fog ) effect .",
    "this effect is non  perturbative , and there is little clue of its exact theoretical form neither in scale nor in time .",
    "all of these systematics are combined in the full rsd analysis , which make lowers our confidence on the cosmological constraints from the rsd effect beyond a conservative limited scale at the quite linear regime .",
    "however , the characteristic bao distances can be probed alternatively , being independent of the detailed knowledge of galaxy clustering in redshift space , by making measurements of the oscillation scale while ignoring or otherwise marginalising the overall shape . in recent efforts",
    "several works have targeted the bao scale using the 1d isotropic density power spectrum and correlation functions @xcite while ignoring or otherwise marginalising out the overall shape of the clustering signal .",
    "the bao scale has been shown to be quite insensitive to non - linear physics and other systematics @xcite , however for near future experiments e.g. desi some of these systematics will have to be understood or controlled to a greater degree @xcite .",
    "the anisotropies of the clustering pattern of the galaxy distribution can also arises from any discrepancy between the true underlying cosmological model and the model used to convert the redshift and angular position of each galaxy to the co - moving radial and transverse distances .",
    "this is the so - called alcock - paczynski ( a - p ) effect @xcite and with a prior knowledge of the characteristic scale of the bao , the hubble parameter @xmath5 and angular diameter distance @xmath6 at the high-@xmath4 galaxies can be separately measured @xcite",
    ".    there have been several methods proposed that apply the ap test to the large scale structure by measuring the clustering of galaxies @xcite , symmetry properties of galaxy pairs @xcite , and cosmic voids @xcite . among them , the method of galaxy clustering has been widely used to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "the main caveat of this method is that , because the radial distances of galaxies are inferred from redshifts , ap tests are inevitably limited by redshift - space - distortions ( rsd ) , which leads to apparent anisotropy even if the adopted cosmology is correct @xcite .    in this work we will introduce our anisotropic ( 2-dimensional ) galaxy clustering statistic and show how in an ideal case , free of systematics , this can be used to locate the bao peak location and thus obtain information on @xmath2 and @xmath7 independently .",
    "we also show that this methodology is robust against the systematics of unknown bias and undetermined shape of the underlying power spectrum .",
    "however , as we will show later , the unknown fog effect causes an anisotropic shift in the bao location which induces a degeneracy been it and hubble parameter @xmath5 .",
    "thus we proceed to model this shift and marginalise out its effects reducing the systematic bias .",
    "this methodology is robustly tested using monte carlo simulations of the galaxy distribution where we show that we can reliably recover the fiducial input cosmological parameters .",
    "the outline of this paper proceeds as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly review the alcock - paczynski effect in a cosmological context and describe the statistical methods we will employ . in ",
    "3 we investigate the bao peak structure and its sensitivity to various systematic uncertainties . in ",
    "4 we test our methodology on simulated mock galaxy catalogs and derive cosmological parameter constraints .",
    "we conclude in  5 .",
    "the observed galaxy clustering anisotropies are plagued by systematic uncertainties which causes the measured geometric distances through bao feature unreliable compared to other distance probes of the universe .",
    "when the galaxy clustering is viewed from the redshift space , the cosmological density and velocity fields couple together and evolve nonlinearly .",
    "in addition , the mapping formula between the real and redshift space is intrinsically nonlinear .",
    "these nonlinearities prevent us from inferring the linear coherent motion from the redshift space clustering straightforwardly .",
    "although an accurate theoretical model for the redshift distortion was proposed in , there is no confirming statement whether the measured distances are immune from the complexity arising from all different types of theoretical models to explain the cosmic acceleration .",
    "we propose that the geometrical distances can be determined with exploiting bao feature as minimal as possible . in the context of standard cosmology , the bao peak structure",
    "is known by analysing cosmic microwave background ( hereafter cmb ) anisotropy produced before the last scattering surface .",
    "the primordial bao feature is probed in precision by cmb experiments .",
    "then we claim that there is a unique correspondence between the measured primordial bao feature by cmb and the observed geometrical bao signature by galaxy clustering survey , which is nearly independent of other cosmological uncertainties .",

    "dash lines represent boundaries of different wedges which are divided by linear @xmath10 scale from @xmath11 to 1 .",
    "the squared points denote the bao peak of one - dimensional correlation function of @xmath12 at each wedge , which are located on the great circle bao ring connecting tip points of all contours of @xmath8 . ]    the geometrical signature of primeval bao is precisely observed through galaxy clustering correlation function @xmath8 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 denote the transverse and radial distances .",
    "the two point correlation distance @xmath15 is defined by @xmath16 .",
    "the clustering patterns are different between inner and outer contours .",
    "the monotonous anisotropic shape is observed with inner contours at @xmath17 . the squeezed clustering pattern along the radial direction is determined by the competition between monopole and quadrupole amplifications which are caused by density and velocity fluctuations respectively .",
    "bao peak structure is observed at outer contours encompassing to cross @xmath18 .",
    "the primordial wiggles on the spectra turns out continuous peaks along the bao ring at @xmath19 which takes an important role to measure distances .",
    "the appearance of bao ring is presented in fig .  [",
    "fig : sigpi_contour ] .    in our previous work",
    ", the full anisotropy analysis is exploited to measure distances .",
    "the bao ring is observed to be invariant by the variation of structure formation when the broadband shape of spectra is previously determined by cmb experiments .",
    "thus we are able to probe distances after marginalising over all structure formation parameters , such as the density & velocity growth functions , the galaxy bias and the random velocity effect .",
    "although it is a thorough methodology , the measured distances can be biased by unknown clustering systematics .",
    "inspired by the invariance of the bao ring , we suggest a new methodology to determine it , independent of any knowledge of the galaxy clustering . in practice , the observed spectra are estimated using referenced coordinates , not true coordinates , because the transformation rule between the observed ( ra , dec , z ) and the cartesian coordinates of distance measures is unknown .",
    "the fiducial cosmology is used to convert the observed ( ra , dec , z ) into comoving cartesian coordinates .",
    "the degree of spatial distortion from this fiducial coordinate can be described by the following quantities , @xmath20_{\\rm fid}}{[\\delta \\pi/\\delta \\sigma]_{\\rm true } } =    \\frac{[d_a(z)h(z)]_{\\rm true}}{[d_a(z)h(z)]_{\\rm fid}},\\ ] ] where @xmath21 , @xmath22 are the angular and radial sizes of the objects , and `` true '' and `` fid '' denote the values of quantities in the true cosmology and fiducial cosmology . @xmath2 and @xmath7 are the angular diameter distance and hubble parameter , respectively .",
    "these geometrical quantities can provide us with information on the particular energy components of the universe and in the specific case of a model with constant dark energy equation of state .",
    "however , if we independently determine the bao ring , which spans both transverse and radial cosmological coordinates , it can be exploited to probe the distance measures of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
