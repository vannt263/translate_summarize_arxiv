    "it is widely believed that the quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) has been created in relativistic heavy ion collisions at relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",

    "these higher order flow harmonics also reveal that the created qgp fireball strongly fluctuates event by event , which finally transforms into final state correlations of the produced hadrons after the collective expansion  @xcite . meanwhile , other flow measurements , such as @xmath3 in ultra - central collisions  @xcite , the distributions of event - by - event flow harmonics  @xcite , the correlations between flow angles  @xcite , and the correlations between flow harmonics of different order  @xcite etc .",
    ", provide more information on the initial state fluctuations , which help to constrain the initial conditions of hydrodynamic simulation for a precise extraction of the qgp transport properties .    besides these flow data of all charged hadrons , the elliptic flow of identified hadrons have also been extensively measured and studied at rhic and the lhc  @xcite . as a typical feather of the collective expansion , the mass ordering of elliptic flow among various hadron species has been observed in different colliding systems  @xcite , which reflects the information of the hadronic evolution after the phase transition .",
    "recently , the alice collaboration has measured the higher order flow harmonics of identified hadrons in ultra - central and semi - central pb+pb collisions at @xmath4 = 2.76 tev  @xcite , which showed that @xmath5 and @xmath6 present similar mass ordering patterns among pions , kaons and protons as observed in the elliptic flow .",
    "it is thus the right time to systematically study these new flow measurements with sophisticated model calculations . in this paper",
    ", we will implement iebe - vishnu hybrid model that couples 2 + 1-d viscous hydrodynamics to the hadron cascade model , together with the fluctuating ampt initial conditions , to calculate @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 of pions , kaons and protons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions .",
    "we will compare our model calculations with the recent alice measurements at 20 - 30% centrality and make predictions for other centrality bins . in the later part of this article",
    ", we will explore the development of @xmath3 mass orderings / splittings during the hadronic evolution through the comparison runs from iebe - vishnu and from pure hydrodynamics decoupled at different temperatures .",
    "@xcite is an event - by - event version of vishnu hybrid model  @xcite which combines ( 2 + 1)-dimensional viscous hydrodynamics ( )  @xcite to describe the qgp expansion with the hadron cascade model ( )  @xcite to simulate the evolution of the hadronic matter .",

    ", we neglect the initial flow  -spectra and the elliptic flow  @xcite . ] because one can not precisely construct both initial flow and initial energy density for ( 2 + 1)-d hydrodynamics with an exact boost invariance from the ( 3 + 1)-d simulations without such boost invariance .",
    "we thus truncate the total produced partons of ampt within @xmath16 ( @xmath21 ) and then construct the needed boost invariant initial energy density profiles in the transverse plane according to eq .",

    ", 4 , 5 , 6 ) of all charged hadrons can not be simultaneously fitted without further considering the effects from bulk viscosity , nucleon - nucleon correlations in the initial state , etc .",
    "therefore , we will not further explore @xmath37 of identified hadron at 0 - 1% centrality as already measured by alice in our current investigations . ] .    to explore in depth the development of flow anisotropy and its distribution among various hadron species during the hadronic evolution",
    ", we further calculate the @xmath24 spectra and differential flow harmonics of identified hadrons at 20 - 30% centrality with three comparison runs , using the same ampt initial conditions and parameter sets : ( 1 ) / ( 2 ) viscous hydrodynamics simulations + resonance decays , with the decoupling temperature set to @xmath38 / @xmath39 , ( 3 ) simulations that combines viscous hydrodynamics with the urqmd hadronic afterburner , which are the same simulations as presented in fig .  1 and fig .  2 for 20 - 30% centrality .",
    "please note that @xmath40 is also the switching temperature between the macroscopic and microscopic approaches in the simulations . with @xmath40 ,",
    "we therefore eliminate the hadronic evolution in the hydrodynamic simulations and concentrate on the flow developed in the qgp phase . for the hydrodynamic simulations with @xmath41 , the hadronic matter below @xmath42",
    "expands like a fluid , which keeps the local thermal equilibrium till the kinetic freeze - out .",
    "meanwhile , the specially constructed equation of state s95p - pce maintains the partially chemical equilibrium of the system during the hadronic evolution .",
    "in contrast , iebe - vishnu below @xmath8 simulates the microscopic expansion of a hadron resonance gas with both scatterings and decays , which quickly evolves out of equilibrium and finally becomes free - streaming hadrons in the very late stage of evolution .",
    "3 shows that , for pure hydrodynamic simulations with eos s95p - pce , the calculated spectra of pions and kaons are not sensitive to the decoupling temperature @xmath43 , both of which are almost overlap with the counterparts from iebe - vishnu .",
    "the spectra of protons from hydrodynamic simulations become flatter as @xmath43 decreased from 165 mev to 120 mev , indicating the development of additional radial flow during the hadronic fluid expansion . the urqmd hadronic evolution below @xmath8",
    "also build up additional radial flow .",
    "meanwhile , the baryon anti - baryon annihilations tend to eat - up the ( anti-)protons at lower-@xmath24 . with these two factors ,",

    "the theoretical calculations are respectively compared with the alice data .",
    "the iebe - vishnu results in the right panels are exactly the same as the corresponding ones shown in fig.2 , which nicely fit the alice data of pions , kaons and protons at 20 - 30% centrality .",
    "in contrast , pure hydrodynamics simulations without hadronic evolution ( @xmath40 , left panels ) under - predict the pion s @xmath0 , @xmath1 @xmath2 due to the insufficient flow anisotropy development in the qgp phase . meanwhile , the smaller radial flow there ( indicated by fig .",
    "3 ) also leads to smaller mass - splittings between pions and protons for different flow harmonics . with @xmath43",
    "decreased to @xmath44 , the hydrodynamics simulations ( middle panels ) roughly fit the alice data for pions and show enhanced the mass - splittings between pions and protons for @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 due to the additional collective flow developed in the hadronic stage . however , the mass - splittings are still under - predicted when compared with the alice data since @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 of protons are still well above the experimental data .",
    "such situation is similar to the case of elliptic flow as found in ref .",
    "@xcite , which showed that , although pure hydrodynamics could nicely fit many soft hadron data of all charged hadrons and pions , the elliptic flow of protons below 2 gev are still over predicted in central and semi - central pb+pb collisions .",
    "a later calculations from vishnu hybrid model  @xcite pointed out that the hadronic scatterings in the urqmd evolution rebalance the generation of radial and elliptic flow , leading to improved descriptions of the proton @xmath0 as well as the mass - splitting of @xmath0 between pions and protons .",
    "the comparison runs in fig .  4 here",
    "demonstrate that microscopic hadronic scatterings in iebe - vishnu are also important for the nice fit of @xmath5 and @xmath6 of protons , which leads to an improved description of the mass - splitting between pions and protons for these higher order flow harmonics .",
    "using the event - by - event vishnu hybrid model iebe - vishnu that couples 2 + 1-d viscous hydrodynamics to the hadron cascade model urqmd , together with the fluctuating ampt initial conditions , we studied the @xmath31-spectra , differential flow harmonics @xmath7 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 of identified hadrons in 2.76 a tev pb+pb collisions . with fine tuned parameters ,",
    "our model calculations nicely described the alice data at 20 - 30% centrality , especially for the mass - orderings among pions , kaons and protons .",
    "we also predicted the higher order flow harmonics of identified hadrons at other centrality bins , which showed a similar mass - ordering pattern as measured / calculated at 20 - 30% centrality .",
    "we explore the development of @xmath3 mass orderings / splittings during the hadronic evolution through the comparison runs from iebe - vishnu simulations and from pure hydrodynamic simulations decoupled at different temperatures .",
    "we found that , in pure hydrodynamics , the additional radial flow developed in the fluid - like hadronic phase could enhance mass splitting between pions and protons for all @xmath3 ( n=2 , 3 , 4 ) .",
    "however , the protons data are still over - predicted there . in contrast , the microscopic hadronic scatterings in iebe - vishnu rebalance the generation of radial and anisotropy flow , leading to nice descriptions of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 data for pions , kaons and protons .    at last",
    ", we would like to remind the interested readers that the past research on elliptic flow  @xcite has showed , although vishnu hybrid model improves the description of elliptic flow for pions , kaons and protons from most central to semi - central collisions , it still slightly under - predicts the proton @xmath0 in semi - peripheral collisions .",
    "further investigations on strange and multi - strange hadrons  @xcite also showed that vishnu simulations can not correctly reproduce all the @xmath0 mass orderings among various stable hadrons , especially for the mass ordering between protons and lambdas .",
    "currently , the alice collaboration only release the measurement of higher order flow harmonics of pions , kaons and protons in ultra - central ( 0 - 1% ) and semi - central ( 20 - 30% ) pb+pb collisions at @xmath45 2.76 a tev .",
    "in fact , extending the current measurements to various centrality bins and collision energies , and even to rarely produced strange and muti - strange hadrons will further test our model calculations , broadening our knowledge on the hot and evolving hadronic matter after the qcd phase transition .",

    "<S> , we explore the development of @xmath3 mass ordering / splitting during the hadronic evolution through the comparison runs from iebe - vishnu hybrid model and pure hydrodynamics with different decoupling temperatures . </S>"
