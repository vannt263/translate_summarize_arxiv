    "one of the fundamental assumptions underpinning modern theories of galaxy formation is that galaxies form and evolve in massive virialised haloes of dark matter @xcite . characterising the properties of these haloes is an important problem , both theoretically and observationally , and its study has been one of the main objectives of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations over the last two decades .",
    "the majority of these simulations have modeled halo formation and evolution in a purely cold dark matter ( cdm ) universe ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with the focus primarily on their equilibrium structure ( cf .",
    "various studies have revealed that cdm haloes in dynamical equilibrium are triaxial structures ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the qualification that a halo is in dynamical equilibrium is a particularly important one when seeking to characterise the structure and kinematics of simulated haloes in cosmological simulations .",
    "previous studies have shown that dynamically unrelaxed haloes tend to have lower central densities ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and higher velocity dispersions ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",

    "yet haloes do not exist in isolation , and the degree to which they are dynamically relaxed or unrelaxed bears the imprint of both their environment and their recent mass assembly and merging history .",
    "as previous studies have shown , dynamically unrelaxed haloes tend to have suffered one or more recent significant mergers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for this reason , it is common practice to use dynamical state and recent merging history interchangeably , with the understanding implicit that unrelaxed haloes are ones that have suffered one or more recent major mergers .",
    "however , it is important to establish this practice on a more quantitative footing and to assess how well a halo s dynamical state and its recent mass assembly history correlate .",
    "this is because of the need to identify robustly haloes that are in dynamical equilibrium  or indeed disequilibrium  in cosmological simulations for further discussion . ] .",
    "the goal of this paper is to quantify this relationship using a statistical sample of haloes drawn from cosmological @xmath0-body simulations of the cdm model .",
    "the cdm model is the ideal testbed for this study because of the fundamental role merging plays in halo mass assembly ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and because we expect massive haloes , which on average form later than their less massive counterparts , to have more violent recent merging histories .",
    "such an undertaking has practical implications .",
    "for example , if we want to robustly characterise the predicted variation of , say , concentration @xmath8 with virial mass @xmath4 on galaxy group and cluster mass scales ( @xmath11 ) , then it is essential that we can identify relaxed systems in a robust fashion .",
    "should we use mass assembly histories directly and select only haloes that have quiescent recent merging histories , or are commonly used measures that estimate dynamical state based on material within the halo s virial radius @xmath12 adequate ?",

    "<S> using a statistical sample of dark matter haloes drawn from a suite of cosmological @xmath0-body simulations of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) model , we quantify the impact of a simulated halo s mass accretion and merging history on two commonly used measures of its dynamical state , the virial ratio @xmath1 and the centre of mass offset @xmath2 . quantifying this relationship is important because the degree to which a halo is dynamically equilibrated will influence the reliability with which we can measure characteristic equilibrium properties of the structure and kinematics of a population of haloes . </S>",
    "<S> we begin by verifying that a halo s formation redshift @xmath3 correlates with its virial mass @xmath4 and we show that the fraction of its recently accreted mass and the likelihood of it having experienced a recent major merger increases with increasing @xmath4 and decreasing @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 increase with increasing @xmath4 and decreasing @xmath3 , which implies that massive recently formed haloes are more likely to be dynamically unrelaxed than their less massive and older counterparts . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis shows that both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are good indicators of a halo s dynamical state , showing strong positive correlations with recent mass accretion and merging activity , but we argue that @xmath2 provides a more robust and better defined measure of dynamical state for use in cosmological @xmath0-body simulations at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that @xmath6 is sufficient to pick out dynamically relaxed haloes at @xmath7=0 . </S>",
