    "quasi - stellar object ( quasar or qso ) absorption lines have long been used to probe the intergalactic medium and also the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies at all redshifts . the damped lyman-@xmath1 systems ( dlas ) ( log @xmath5 @xmath6 ) are thought to contain most of the neutral gas in the universe at high - redshifts @xcite , with sub - dlas ( @xmath7 @xmath5 @xmath8 ) also believed to have significant fraction at high - redshift @xcite . at lower redshift",
    ", a survey for sub - dlas at @xmath9 by @xcite found that they contain @xmath1015% of the universe s h atoms .",
    "the large h  i column densities of both dlas and sub - dlas are typical of what is seen in the disks and nearby environments of galaxies . as such , these systems are believed to be strongly related to galaxies at their observed redshift . at @xmath11",
    ", dlas have been associated to galactic ism @xcite .",
    "these systems provide a unique means to probe galaxies over @xmath12 of the cosmic history , without the biases introduced in magnitude - limited samples of galaxies studied in emission .",
    "since these systems have such large column densities , the majority of the h is expected to remain neutral due to self - shielding .",
    "these high column densities also make absorption lines from metal atoms more detectable .",
    "any metals inside one of these clouds will be dominantly in states with ionization potentials greater than that of h@xmath13 , since photoionization effects will be negligible . for sub - dlas ,",
    "the lower column densities make these photoionization effects more significant and corrections are typically applied through use of ionization models .",
    "dlas are of particular importance to chemical evolution studies",
    ". measurements of element abundances in such systems provide insights into the production of metals through cosmic time .",
    "this task is complicated by the large scatter in metallicities seen at any given redshift , due to the random sampling of galaxies with different masses and different environments .",
    "however , this is actually beneficial , since the sample will naturally probe a more representative range of all metallicities and provide an unbiased description of chemical enrichment .",
    "despite the large scatter , using the large sample size of dlas measured at high - redshift , @xcite found evidence for an increase in elemental abundances with increasing cosmic time .",
    "this picture is consistent with our expectation that the universe becomes more metal - rich as it evolves .",
    "interestingly , many dlas and sub - dlas appear to be underabundant in n with respect to the other metals in these systems @xcite , even at low - redshifts . observations of n in dlas and sub - dlas are important for the study of n production and galactic chemical evolution in general @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , relatively few measurements of low - redshift dlas and sub - dlas have been made @xcite because the atmospheric cutoff of light below @xmath103000 makes ground based observing of the lyman-@xmath1 line impossible for redshifts @xmath14 . with the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) aboard the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , we are able to study these low - redshift systems with unprecedented efficiency .",
    "this instrument provides us with a great opportunity to expand this small sample .",
    "these systems are crucial for a clear understanding of chemical evolution since @xmath15 spans @xmath1040% of the age of the universe .",
    "although much can be learned from absorption line data , the difficulty in the interpretation of these systems stems from the lack of information about the host galaxies of dlas and sub - dlas at all redshifts .",
    "the number of dlas with spectroscopically confirmed hosts is very small and this is in part due to the much lower number of low - redshift dlas compared to high - redshift . at high - redshift , the cosmological dimming of the surface brightness of galaxies ( @xmath16 ) makes galaxy detections more difficult .",
    "low - redshift dlas present a unique opportunity to study the absorber - galaxy connection , since the host will be more easily detected .    in this paper",
    ", we report on 3 dlas and 5 sub - dlas over a redshift range of @xmath17 . in ",
    "2 we give background information on the discovery of these systems and on the observations . in ",
    "3 we describe our techniques for determining column densities from absorption lines . in  4.1",
    "we report the total column densities and abundances of each system , correction for photoionizing effects in the sub - dla cases . in  4.2 we report the depletion patterns of systems with a sufficient number of detected lines for analysis . in",
    " 4.3 the metallicities of our absorbers will be compared to those in the literature and also with chemical evolution models . in  5 we discuss nitrogen measurements for each system and possible implications on nitrogen nucleosynthesis . in  6 we identify affiliated galaxies for 3 of the sub - dlas using observations from a redshift survey with keck / lris .",
    "conclusions are summarized in  7 . throughout this paper ,",
    "we adopt a cosmological model with @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20  mpc@xmath4 .",
    "the dlas and sub - dlas in this sample were discovered serendipitously as part of programs go11598 and go12248 ( pi : tumlinson ) , programs focused on studying multiphase baryons in halos of @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 galaxies and dwarf galaxy halos , respectively .",
    "early results from these programs can be found in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the names and basic properties of these absorbers are presented in table [ tab : prop ] .",
    "the dla with the highest column density in our sample , sdss j1009 + 0713 , was presented in detail in @xcite along with basic information of the other systems .",
    "the details of our cos observations are summarized in table [ tab : observ ] .",
    "follow - up keck / hires @xcite observations were acquired for three of our absorption systems to see more detailed component structure , since cos has lower resolution ( r@xmath1020,000 ) compared to hires ( r@xmath1044,000 ) , and those are also summarized in table [ tab : observ ] .",
    "a more detailed description of the cos observations for this project along with its data reduction methods were outlined in @xcite .",
    "the velocity centroids and @xmath24 values for this system were determined using o  i because of the large number of observed lines at differing line strengths .",
    "the kinematics of this system appear complex with 4 components over a large velocity spread being needed to properly fit the observed profile at cos resolution .",
    "the o  i parameters were then used to fit n  i , si  ii , pii , and fe  ii , and the results can be seen in figure [ fig : j1001vel ] .",
    "this sub - dla shows a lyman limit break in the continuum at a wavelength of 1195 in the cos rest frame .",
    "the velocity centroids and @xmath24 values for this system were determined using n  i because there are 6 observed lines and most of the o  i lines appear saturated or blended .",
    "the kinematics of this system appear simple with only 2 components needed to properly fit the observed profile at cos resolution .",
    "the velocity parameters from the n  i fit were then used to fit si  ii , s  ii , and fe  ii , and the results can be seen in figure [ fig : j1435vel ] .",
    "the velocity centroids and @xmath24 values for this system were determined using si  ii since it was the most extensively covered line .",
    "the kinematics of this system appear very simple with only a single component needed to properly fit the observed profile at cos resolution .",
    "the si  ii parameters were then used to fit n  ii and fe  ii , and the results can be seen in figure [ fig : j1553vel ] .",
    "the velocity centroids and @xmath24 values for this system were determined using fe  ii .",
    "the kinematics of this system appear simple with only 3 components needed to properly fit the observed profile at cos resolution .",
    "the parameters from the fe  ii fit were then used to fit c  ii * , p  ii , s  ii , and fe  ii and the results can be seen in figure [ fig : j1616vel ] .",
    "optical spectra of j1619 + 3342 were obtained with the keck / hires spectrograph .",
    "the absorption lines detected by keck for this system are shown in figure [ fig : j1619keckvel ] .",
    "the mg  ii lines lie at the edge of the detector and so have very low s / n .",
    "the velocity centroids and @xmath24 values for this system were determined using mg  i. the kinematic structure of this system is simple and required only 2 components to properly fit the observed profile . for very strong transitions ,",
    "such as mg  ii , c  ii , and si  iii , an additional component at @xmath25  seems to appear .",
    "however , this additional component was not used in the fits of the weaker lines .",
    "the mg  i fit parameters were then used to fit n  i , si  ii , p  ii , s  ii , ca  ii , fe  ii , and fe  iii and the results can be seen in figure [ fig : j1619vel ] . since the resolution of the cos instrument is lower than that of keck , some of the cos fits utilize only the component at @xmath26 , since it appears to contain most of the column density ."
