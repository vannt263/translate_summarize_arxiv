    "the standard model of particle physics requires a number of fundamental physical constants as inputs .",
    "these constants are defined by dimensionless ratios of physical quantities , e.g.  the charge of the electron , or the speed of light , but , as dimensionless ratios , they have the same value for any choice of physical units . no physical theory predicts their values , so we must derive their values from measurements .",
    "the fine - structure constant , @xmath4 , is the coupling constant that sets the scale of electromagnetic interactions , and its possible variation will be the focus of this paper : @xmath5 with the value of @xmath3 at some redshift @xmath6  denoted as @xmath7 and the current laboratory value as @xmath8 .",
    "experimental and observational limits have been placed on @xmath9 over a range of precisions and time - scales , with @xcite reviewing the various methods and constraints .",
    "these generally range from a very tight constraint over several years in laboratories , e.g.  a few parts per 10@xmath10 ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , to somewhat looser constraints at cosmological scales , e.g.  a few percent with the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "however , measurements of @xmath11 in absorption systems found within quasar spectra probe values of @xmath3 over cosmological time and distance with a typical precision of several parts per million ( ppm ) .",
    "the interest in the possibility of the variation of two fundamental constants ( @xmath3 and @xmath12 ) has intensified over the past 15 years since the emergence of some evidence for a cosmological variation of @xmath3 from quasar studies .",
    "this evidence came with the increased sensitivity to @xmath3 variation enable by the ` many - multiplet ' ( mm ) method @xcite : the comparison of many different metal ion transitions whose frequencies have widely differing dependence on @xmath3 .",
    "absorption systems that lie along the line - of - sight to a quasar imprint a number of narrow metal absorption lines onto its spectrum , and @xmath11is measured by comparing the relative wavelength spacing of these features .",
    "the mm method was first applied to a sample of 30 quasar absorption systems with the keck  hires in @xcite . in the years since",
    ", the mm method has been applied to several other individual absorption systems .",
    "however , the most statistically significant results have come from two large samples : a substantially increased keck ",
    "hires sample and a more recent sample measured with the vlt  uves spectrograph .",
    "hires and uves are high resolution ( @xmath1380,000 ) echelle spectrographs on 8-to-10-m class telescopes : keck ( hawaii ) and vlt ( chile ) respectively . the final keck sample combined @xmath9 measurements from 140 absorption systems , along 78 lines of sight , to yield a statistically significant non - zero weighted average of @xmath14 ppm @xcite .",
    "@xcite later analyzed 153 systems with the vlt and found a statistically significant positive average value .",
    "however , by combining the vlt sample with the keck sample , @xcite and @xcite found evidence for a spatial dipole in the value of @xmath3 across the sky . these surprising results demand detailed investigations into possible systematic effects in high resolution spectrographs that might mimic this possible evidence for a varying @xmath3 .",
    "we continue that effort here .",
    "any significant distortion of the wavelength scale , especially over long wavelength ranges ( @xmath151000 ) , could have a serious impact on the accuracy of @xmath11measurements from quasar absorption spectra .",
    "the predicted relative wavelength shifts for @xmath16 few ppm correspond to 1/10th of a pixel wavelength accuracy across the wavelength range of the spectrograph .",
    "thus , having an accurate wavelength scale is extremely important .",
    "the standard method used to calibrate the wavelength scale of quasar exposures on high resolution spectrographs is by comparison with a separate thar arc lamp exposure .",

    "these studies uncovered and quantified new systematic errors , such as a varying instrument profile ( ip ) , intra - order wavelength scale distortions , ccd pixel - size irregularities and , more recently , long - range wavelength scale distortions : in their study of possible variations in @xmath12 , @xcite cross - correlated asteroid spectra , observed with vlt  uves , with laboratory solar spectra and found differential velocity shifts between them of up to 400  over @xmath0600-  scales .",

    "the light path when observing an astronomical object is as follows .",
    "the light reflects off the primary , secondary and tertiary mirrors of the telescope , into a pre - slit unit ( containing calibration lamps and optics ) where it passes through an image derotator and then into the nasmyth - mounted uves enclosure .",
    "when a dichroic mirror is in use , the light is split into red and blue light to pass through to the different arms .",

    "uves has a total of 3 ccds , one in the blue arm and two ( denoted ` upper ' and ` lower ' ) in the red arm .",
    "the thar calibration lamp is housed in the uves enclosure and when a calibration exposure is taken , a mirror is swung into the light path immediately after the telescope shutter , where it reflects the lamp light through the rest of the spectrograph . when an iodine cell is being used",
    "it is heated and placed in the light path in front of the derotator within the uves enclosure .",
    "we use the standard european southern observatory ( eso ) data reduction software , common pipeline library ( cpl ) version 4.7.8 .",

    "the principle aim of this paper is to understand the effect of any wavelength miscalibration on quasar spectra that could lead to errors in previous @xmath3 measurements . as most of the keck spectra used in @xcite",
    "were reduced with the reduction software makee , we use makee to reduce the supercalibration spectra throughout this paper .",
    "the other main reduction software available is hiresredux ] maintained by j.  x.  prochaska .",
    "we tested the two software packages by comparing their relative wavelength solutions to the same supercalibration exposures and our tests did not find substantive differences .",
    "the standard method for wavelength calibrating a quasar exposure on a slit spectrograph is by comparison with a thar arc lamp exposure .",
    "the calibration source is a thar lamp that emits a spectrum with very sharp emission lines at known wavelengths .",
    "a 2d wavelength solution maps the detector s ccd pixels to wavelengths .",
    "the thar wavelength solution is simply adopted as that of the quasar exposure .",
    "when accurate wavelength scales are needed , thar exposures should clearly be taken before slewing the telescope after the quasar exposure and without changing any of the spectrograph settings . however , even when such care is taken , the thar light may still follow a different light path through the spectrograph compared to the quasar exposure because the thar lamp is typically mounted within the spectrograph .",
    "and , at the very least , the thar light typically illuminates the slit ( close to ) uniformly , whereas most science objects , e.g. , quasars and stars , are point - like , so different point - spread functions are to be expected .",
    "if those differences are wavelength dependent , a potentially important calibration error will ensue .    in principle",
    ", the accuracy of the thar calibration method can be tested by comparing a thar - calibrated spectrum with a reference spectrum of the same science object on a different ` absolutely calibrated ' spectrograph .",
    "the supercalibration method that we use in this paper follows this basic procedure .",
    "we take an exposure of a source with the telescope s spectrograph , and compare its final calibrated spectrum with the reference spectrum of the same source from a fourier transform spectrometer ( fts ) .",
    "we then solve for a relative velocity shift between these two spectra as a function of wavelength .",
    "in general , the most useful reference spectra have a large amount of spectral information , i.e. , containing many sharp , narrow absorption features .",
    "we call this the ` supercalibration ' method : it aims to check the normal calibration against a more reliable reference",
    ".    the basic implementation of the supercalibration method takes advantage of two different reference spectra : a molecular iodine ( i@xmath18 ) absorption spectrum and the solar spectrum .",
    "these spectra have a near continuous forest of narrow absorption features that allows us to consider small chunks of each spectrum , typically 500wide ( @xmath198  at 5000  ) .",
    "we determine the relative velocity shift between the reference chunk and the object spectrum using the following five transformations to each reference chunk : 1 ) a constant wavelength shift , 2 ) a flux scaling factor , 3 ) a constant flux offset , 4 ) a linear continuum slope correction , and 5 ) the velocity width of a gaussian instrument profile ( ip ) . because we are solving for transformations of the entire spectrum within each chunk we are using all of the spectral information available .",
    "we solve for the best - fitting model parameters by minimizing @xmath20 between the transformed reference chunk and the object spectrum using iminuit , the python implementation of seal minuit ] .    in all that follows",
    ", the reference will be a high fts spectrum of the relevant reference source , either the solar spectrum or the iodine cell absorption spectrum .",
    "the fts is an instrument that works under a fundamentally different process than the echelle spectrographs on telescopes , and we expect the relative fts frequency scale ( and thus wavelength scale ) to be much more accurate .",
    "therefore , the reference fts spectrum s wavelength scale is assumed to be correct ; this assumption can be relaxed in certain ways that are detailed later ( see section  [ ssub : methods_solar_test ] ) .",
    "the best - fit wavelength shift for each chunk is given by the following relation : @xmath21 .",
    "we plot our results in this paper with this wavelength shift turned into a velocity shift via @xmath22 the final , reported shift should be added to the standard thar calibration solution to obtain the ` correct ' wavelength , i.e. , that matching the fts reference .",
    "for example , a for a given chunk of + 50 means that the science spectrum needs 50 added to its wavelength scale for that chunk to align with the reference spectrum .",
    "we note two practical details here about implementing the supercalibration method before describing our two implementations in the following two subsections .",
    "first , for all the analysis that follows , we mask atmospheric lines by removing the portion of the spectrum around and including the wavelength of known telluric emission and absorption lines ] . the presence of strong atmospheric lines can cause a spurious value for the derived from the supercalibration method .",
    "second , our method is applied to each echelle order separately and not on order - merged or redispersed exposures , so no artifacts or spurious velocity shifts can enter from redispersing or combining overlapping edges of adjacent orders .",
    "the uves and hires instruments each contain a glass enclosure containing molecular iodine gas ( i@xmath18 ) called an iodine cell .",
    "this is heated to either 70@xmath23c ( uves ) or 50@xmath23c ( hires ) and , at the observers request , placed directly in the light path of the spectrograph . as light passes through the iodine cell a forest of narrow absorption features",
    "is imprinted from roughly 50006200 .",
    "the iodine cell has been used extensively for exoplanet detection @xcite .",
    "we make use of the iodine cell as an independent check of the thar wavelength solution .",
    "the first implementation of this method used the iodine cell spectra imprinted onto a quasar spectrum ( see * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * for details ) , and we use it again for the current work with a few minor improvements ( allowing a constant flux offset , for example ) .",
    "the main difference is that here we use a fast - rotating bright star as the source because these are much brighter than quasars .",
    "the rotation effectively blurs any sharp spectral features from the star itself . after calibrating this exposure with a thar exposure in the standard way",
    ", we use the supercalibration method to compare it with a laboratory fts spectrum of the iodine cell as the reference .",
    "the fts spectrum ] of the iodine cell has much higher resolving power ( @xmath24 ) than the telescope echelle spectrographs , uves or hires ( @xmath1380,000 ) , used in the relevant quasar studies .",

    "the much higher resolving power of the fts is clearly visible . during the fitting process ,",

    "we use the iodine supercalibration method in section  [ sub : results_sliteffects ] , where we characterize the effect of object placement within the spectrograph slit .          the main results of this paper derive from using the supercalibration method with the solar spectrum .",
    "we extend the same supercalibration method used by the iodine cell , but instead of iodine , we use the solar atmosphere as the reference source .",
    "the main advantage of using the solar spectrum is that sharp , narrow absorption lines are present at all optical wavelengths , not just at 50006200  as in the iodine method .",
    "another advantage is that no change in the telescope s optical path is required .",
    "in contrast , after placing the iodine cell in the light path , adjustments usually have to be made to the focus and slit alignment .",
    "the solar fts reference spectrum we use comes from the chance / kurucz fts vacuum solar spectrum @xcite , which they refer to as kpno2010 ] . to access the solar spectrum at the telescope we observe two types of astronomical objects : asteroids and ` solar twins ' .",
    "the first uses the sun s spectrum itself reflected off solar system objects , in this case asteroids ( moons are another possibility ) .",
    "the second uses stars that have almost identical spectra to our sun and , for the intents and purposes here , can be treated as real solar spectra .",
    "we present the latter method here for the first time , demonstrating that it is effective and has several advantages over the other methods .",
    "the asteroid - reflected solar spectrum has been used before for spectrograph calibrations . @xcite",
    "first fitted for a relative radial velocity difference between the centroids of a small number of selected , individual absorption lines and others in the same spectrum and also with the corresponding lines in a laboratory fts solar spectrum .",
    "@xcite instead used a cross - correlation technique to compare spectral regions approximately one echelle order wide ( @xmath1980 ) , containing many absorption lines , between asteroid and laboratory fts spectra .",
    "our technique uses small spectral chunks , 500  ( @xmath198 ) wide , which allows us to map wavelength calibration distortions not only over long wavelength ranges , but also in detail across each echelle order .",
    "we present a new technique for comparing spectra of ` solar twin ' stars and solar fts spectra .",
    "this technique is the same as for the asteroids in all respects ( same reference fts , same velocity chunk size , etc . ) , except that it uses a solar twin as the object spectrum , rather than solar light reflected from solar system objects . in this work we restricted observations to stars defined as ` twins ' or ` analogues ' of the sun in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite",
    "however , we have recently observed other ` solar - like ' stars  those with similar spectral types to our sun , e.g.  g1v ",
    "g4v  and compared their supercalibration results with those from known solar twins ; the results are very similar and it may well be possible to obtain reliable supercalibration information from a much larger number of stars than just those deemed as solar ` twins ' or ` analogues ' .",
    "the close match between the solar fts and typical solar twin spectra from the telescope can be easily seen in  = 1001 figure  [ fig : best - single - bin]fig .",
    "[ fig : best - single - bin]figure  [ fig : best - single - bin ] .",
    "the number density of spectral features in the solar spectrum is such that the solar twin ( and asteroid ) supercalibration technique provides a velocity shift measurement with statistical precision of @xmath1912  for each 500-  chunk when the spectral is @xmath19120per 1.3-  pixel .",
    "with @xmath1910 chunks per echelle order , this is adequate for diagnosing relative velocity distortions of @xmath2530  over intra - order and/or long - range wavelength scales .",
    "this statistical error derives only from the photon noise in the spectra , so it will diminish as @xmath1 .",
    "however , it will only improve with increasing resolving power if the solar absorption lines are individually unresolved and not substantially blended together .",
    "= 1001 figure  [ fig : best - single - bin]fig .",
    "[ fig : best - single - bin]figure  [ fig : best - single - bin ] illustrates that , at least at resolving powers typical of most quasar observations ( @xmath26 ) , the latter is not generally true .",
    "therefore , the statistical precision of this method is unlikely to improve substantially with increasing resolving power .",
    "several concerns can be raised about the use of solar twins .",
    "first of all , the absorption features of sun - like stars change , so individual absorption lines in the fts reference and the solar twin spectrum may have slightly different relative optical depths . however , the way we derive the supercalibration information is not from any particular line , but from chunks of a spectrum which contain many lines . and , even if relative optical depth changes to many lines conspired to produce a spurious velocity shift in one chunk , the effect will be different in other chunks .",
    "second , it is important to realize that , even if the solar twin is not exactly the same as our sun and the relative strengths of some lines differ , the underlying transition frequencies in the two spectra are the same . despite this , stellar activity , including the motions of convective cells and starspots , will cause shifts between the centroids of the absorption features in the star relative to the fts solar spectrum .",
    "these effects will have both random and systematic components which are much less than the typical line width , i.e.  @xmath27100 .",
    "line - to - line random shifts are diminished in our technique because each chunk includes many lines , while the systematic component should not be important for determining wavelength calibration distortions ( i.e.  systematic velocity shift variations with wavelength ) . due to similar activity variations in our own sun",
    ", our asteroid technique will also suffer from some of these effects .",
    "however , a line - by - line analysis , like that first conducted by @xcite , coupled with monitoring of solar activity , can in principle remove these effects .    finally , if wavelength calibration distortions are driven by drifts in the spectrographs , it may be a problem that there is a substantial difference in the exposure times between solar twins and quasars .",
    "however , the benefit of a short exposure time is that the calibration check is relatively rapid and can be taken during the night . a possible advantage of this technique over using reflected solar light from solar system objects ( e.g. asteroids like in section  [ ssub : methods_solar_asteroid ] , or the moon ) or sky emission spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is that stars are unresolved point sources02 which , for the purposes of most optical observations , where the seeing is typically @xmath2505 , is unresolved .",
    "however , the brightest asteroids ( e.g.  ceres and vesta ) can be marginally resolved in such conditions . ] .",
    "this means that they offer the closest comparison to the quasar observations [ aside from directly comparing two spectra of the same object , which can provide information about relative calibration distortions , e.g.  @xcite ] .",
    "solar twins are also at fixed positions in the sky  they do not move at substantially non - sidereal rates like asteroids and other solar system objects .",
    "this increases the practicality of solar twin supercalibration .",
    "another possible concern about using the solar fts reference is the assumption that its wavelength scale is correct and does not suffer from any systematic distortions itself .",
    "the fts spectrum was constructed by stitching together several overlapping fts scans of the solar spectrum @xcite , and this stitching could introduce long - range wavelength distortions .",
    "a few of these concerns can be addressed by some relatively simple checks .",
    "the high accuracy radial velocity planet searcher ( harps ) spectrograph is a very stable , well - calibrated , temperature controlled and , most importantly for the present considerations , fibre - fed vacuum spectrograph on the eso la silla 3.6 m telescope @xcite .",
    "it differs in a number of ways from a slit spectrograph in air ( uves and hires ) : the optical fibre feeds the light directly to the instrument , the instrument is held to a constant temperature , a second fibre can constantly input the thar spectrum to monitor any potential change in the wavelength scale , the instrument is kept in a vacuum , and the fibre scrambles the image before it is fed into the instrument .",
    "nevertheless , studies of harps using highly accurate laser frequency - comb calibration by @xcite and indicate that thar calibration results in @xmath1970distortions on echelle order scales ( @xmath19100 ) .",
    "the intra - order distortions were proposed to arise from pixel size changes near the edges of the 512-pixel manufacturing stamp pattern and ruled out errors in the laboratory wavelengths of the thar lines as another possible origin .",
    "neither study revealed evidence for long - range distortions , though they covered relatively short / moderate wavelengths ranges ( @xmath050  at 5150  and 48005800 , respectively ) . nor are long - range distortions evident in the results of the line - by - line comparison by @xcite between harps asteroid spectra and solar altases @xcite at 40004100 and 54006900 .",
    "the results of a solar twin supercalibration using harps is shown in = 1001 figure  [ fig : uves - hires - harps]fig .",
    "[ fig : uves - hires - harps]figure  [ fig : uves - hires - harps ] .",
    "we see clear evidence intra - order distortions in these harps results , but with very little long - range wavelength calibration distortion .",
    "the intra - order distortions are similar in both shape and magnitude to those seen in the laser frequency - comb calbibrated harps spectra of @xcite and .",
    "this confirms that the solar twin supercalibration technique returns reasonably reliable information about relative distortions .",
    "however , our results are not identical to the frequency - comb results : our intra - order distortions typically span approximately @xmath28  across each order , with either a flattening or slight reversal of the intra - order slope towards the order edges , whereas the results of @xcite and generally show a @xmath29  span with the slope reversing completely towards the order edges .",
    "an important possibility is that the intra - order distortions are somewhat variable within harps , so further testing of different supercalibration techniques with harps is desirable .",
    "there may be some evidence in = 1001 figure  [ fig : uves - hires - harps]fig .",

    "we do not attempt to correct this possible effect in the results of this paper because it is significantly smaller than the typical distortions we find in the uves and hires instruments .",

    "interestingly , it appears that each arm of uves suffers from a long - range distortion with a similar slope , while the single arm of hires is characterized by a single distortion .",
    "the supercalibration for each of these three instruments uses the same fts reference , so any intrinsic distortions from the supercalibration method itself must be much smaller than the effect we are detecting in uves and hires . finally , even if there is some conspiratorial way that the fts and harps spectrographs have wavelength distortions that effectively cancel each other , the relative differences between hires and uves still remain ( though their absolute levels of distortion would be unknown ) .    in summary ,",
    "the solar twin supercalibration is a new approach that reliably exposes and quantifies distortions in the thar wavelength solution .",
    "the next section details the different long - range wavelength scale distortions in both the uves and hires instruments .",
    "one key advantage of the solar twin supercalibration method is that exposures of various solar twin stars have been taken with keck  hires and vlt  uves over many years . applying the solar twin supercalibration method to both",
    "the keck  hires and vlt  uves archival exposures , taken across a wide range of dates and conditions , therefore allows us to quantify the historical record of long - range velocity distortions of the instruments .",
    "below , we find significant long - range velocity distortions in both keck  hires and vlt  uves over most of their lifetimes , albeit somewhat sparsely sampled .",
    "we examine the distortions themselves in this section , while we analyze the impact that these distortions may have had on previous fundamental constant measurements in section  [ sec : implications ] .        as described in section  [ sub : observations_uves ] , the uves spectrograph has the option of using a dichroic mirror to split incoming light into two arms ( red and blue ) .",
    "the red arm consists of two ccds , while the blue arm has a single ccd .",
    "there are a number of standard wavelength settings for uves that are referred to by their central wavelength in nm for the two arms .",
    "for example , the 390/580 setting centres the blue arm at 3900  and the red arm at 5800 . the central wavelength of the blue arm falls in the centre of the blue ccd , while in the red arm the central wavelength falls between the two ccds .",
    "uves was designed so that the gratings could be reliably set , changed , and reset to the same position such that dispersed wavelengths were directed to the same ccd location to within @xmath191/10@xmath30 of a pixel .",
    "the goal of this design was to maximize time during the night spent taking science exposures , with the thar calibration exposures to be taken at the end of the night . because of this design , the gratings are automatically reset after each observation block ( ob ) during the standard observation protocol .",
    "thar exposures taken in this way are referred to as `` unattached '' .",

    "in addition to these inherent differences , the practical goal of keeping a quasar centred in the slit during long exposures is often difficult to maintain .",
    "the quasar often drifts within  both along and across  the slit .",
    "drifts across the slit are particularly problematic because they translate to velocity shifts in the spectral lines and possibly higher - order effects leading to velocity distortions .",
    "for example , the effective instrument profile will change as one side of the quasar seeing disc is vignetted by the slit .",
    "if that effect has a wavelength - dependent component ( e.g.  seeing dependence on wavelength ) , a velocity distortion could be induced .",
    "also , as discussed above ( section  [ ssub : ssub : results_longrange_hires ] ) , if observations are not made at the parallactic angle , differential atmospheric refraction may cause long - range velocity distortions .",
    "however , as discussed in @xcite , this is only relevant for hires quasar spectra taken before the image rotator was installed in 1996 ; all other spectra were observed with the slit held at the appropriate angle .",

    "the star was then placed in the centre of the slit and a second exposure was taken , followed by a third exposure with the star displaced by about a third of the slit width in the opposite direction to the first exposure .",

    "the solar twin method presented here also carries significant advantages over the asteroid method : solar twins are located at fixed sky positions , at all right - ascensions , and many are brighter ( @xmath79mag ) than most asteroids .",

    "the distortions are on scales of both echelle orders ( @xmath050100 , `` intra - order '' ) and entire spectrograph arms ( @xmath010003000 , `` long - range '' ) , and seem to occur over the full variety of instrument setups and epochs .",

    "many of the supercalibration exposures show evidence for a somewhat non - linear distortion , typically with a flattening in the bluest @xmath03rd of the wavelength range . characterizing each spectrograph arm with a linear distortion , we find similar magnitudes for the slope in both spectrographs : typically @xmath80but up to @xmath0800  in some exposures .",
    "the sign of the slope seems to fluctuate in both spectrographs over the 11.5 decades for which we have ( sparse ) supercalibration information .",

    "see figs .",
    "[ fig : uves - slope - history ] and [ fig : hires - slope - history ] .",
    "we explored the possible physical drivers of these distortions in both spectrographs and established a working hypothesis for their cause : differential vignetting of the astronomical object and thar calibration light paths within the spectrograph , with the likelihood that the thar vignetting dominates and is most variable .",
    "some evidence supporting this hypothesis is that ( i ) the long - range and , at least for uves , intra - order distortions do not appear to change as the position of the astronomical object within the spectrograph slit is varied ; ( ii ) the long - range slope for uves changes significantly when thar exposures taken at different ( de)rotator angles are compared .",
    "if this hypothesis is correct and the ultimate , mechanical cause can be firmly established , it may be possible to accurately predict the long - range distortions expected in previous quasar exposures . however , at present , the available information is not sufficient to confirm our hypothesis .",
    "the results of ongoing , dedicated tests on uves and hires will be reported in a future paper .    finally , we estimated the approximate effect of the long - range distortions on the measurements of @xmath11from large samples of archival hires @xcite and uves @xcite using simulated quasar spectra . in the absence of a causal , physical model to predict the long - range distortions , we instead modelled them with a single , linear slope per spectrograph arm , as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : vlt - split - linear - model ] and [ fig : hires - linear - model ] for uves ( 2 arms ) and hires ( 1 arm ) , respectively .",
    "the slope assumed for each spectrograph was simply representative of the significantly variable but sparsely sampled information about the long - range distortions over the epochs in which the relevant quasar spectra were recorded ( figs .",
    "[ fig : uves - slope - history ] and [ fig : hires - slope - history ] ) . even with these simplifying assumptions , the effect on simulated quasar spectra mimics many of the features of the uves results obtained in @xcite , including a slow change in the sign of @xmath11from @xmath81 to @xmath251.8 and a sharp change at @xmath58 .",
    "further , the simulated @xmath11values correlate strongly with the uves quasar values , and correcting the latter with the former significantly reduces the scatter in @xmath11 .",
    "however , the hires model does not simultaneously reproduce a mean @xmath11of the same sign at both low and high redshifts , as observed in the quasar results @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it may explain a component of the additional scatter in the hires @xmath11measurements obtained around @xmath822.4 .    in summary ,",
    "it is clear that long - range distortions of the wavelength scale identified here have the characteristics required to adequately explain the vlt  uves quasar measurements of @xmath11 , though they can not entirely explain those from keck  hires .",
    "that is , if both sets of quasar measurements are corrected with our distortion models , the vlt measurements are consistent with @xmath52 at all redshifts , while the keck results deviate from zero at either @xmath75 or @xmath76 depending on the sign of the prevailing distortions . as a consequence , combining the datasets to search for subtle variations with redshift or across the sky , for example , requires a more detailed understanding of the possible systematic errors in the keck  hires quasar measurements ( at least ) .",
    "the long - range distortions therefore significantly weaken the possible evidence for variations in the fine - structure constant over cosmological time and spatial scales . understanding the causes of the intra - order and long - range distortions , and whether they can be corrected ,",
