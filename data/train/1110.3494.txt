    "the early 1970s witnessed the start of the intensive study of radiation emanated by superluminal sources @xcite , which received a new impetus due to possibility of launching propagation - invariant localized waves @xcite , whose fundamental representations and classification schemes are discussed in @xcite . among different types of the localized wave structures , the x - shaped waves are one of the most well - known @xcite .",
    "recami et al .",
    "@xcite proposed a toy model of localized x - shaped field generation by an axisymmetric superluminal four - current @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the speed of light , @xmath2 the electric charge density , and @xmath3 the only non - zero component of the current density vector @xmath4 in the cylindrical coordinates @xmath5 .",
    "considering the inhomogeneous electromagnetic problem for the four - potential in the form @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is a @xmath10-cone variable , introduced for constant superluminal velocity @xmath11 , and @xmath12 the time variable , the investigation was inevitably constrained to the cases that ( i ) describe a steady - state process that lasts all times from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , ( ii ) require similar four - current dependence @xmath15 , and ( iii ) bound the nonzero components of the four - vectors by relations @xmath16 and @xmath17 due to , respectively , the continuity equation and the lorentz gauge .",
    "the problem was solved for the case of the rectilinear motion of a point - like charge using the spectral method ( fourier - bessel and fourier transforms with respect to @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) , yielding a localized `` true x wave '' solution @xmath20 being symmetric with respect to time reversal and involving equally the advanced and retarded components , such a model of x wave generation is acausal .",
    "later attempts to remedy this drawback introducing the unilateral conical - wave source @xcite and applying the unidirectional decomposition @xcite resulted in more realistic models .",
    "all these studies , however , do not take into account the temporal constraint of the source motion  even in its weak form that assumes the existence of an initial moment , prior to which neither the source pulse nor the emanated wave can exist .",
    "the present work considers wave generation by superluminal charges within the framework of the riemann - volterra approach , introducing a direct space - time domain method that , in contrast to constructing the wavefunctions via the bateman transform @xcite or green s method @xcite , deals with the initial value problem that includes , in addition to the inhomogeneous wave equation @xmath21\\psi \\left ( \\tau , \\rho , z \\right ) = s \\left ( \\tau , \\rho , z \\right ) , \\ ] ] the time asymmetric initial condition @xmath22 which defines the _ arrow of time _ and , as will be shown , represents a sufficient condition for existence of a unique causal solution . for",
    "the electromagnetic waves , we assume that @xmath23 and @xmath24 represent , respectively , the @xmath25-components of the four - potential @xmath26 and four - current @xmath27 ( @xmath28 stands for the magnetic constant ) . furthermore , let us get over one singularity , considering , instead of the line @xmath29-pulse , a line source of arbitrary shape @xmath30 propagating with a constant superluminal speed in the positive @xmath25-direction .",
    "in view of ( [ inhomogenwaveeq ] ) , ( [ timeasyminicond ] ) , such a source can be expressed in the form @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the elementary charge while @xmath33 and @xmath34 stand for the dirac delta and heaviside step functions .",
    "one can easily notice that due to ( [ timeasyminicond ] ) in no case the problem in question can yield a pure localized solution meeting the propagation - invariant condition stated by lu ( ref .",
    "@xcite , p.  98 ) as reducibility to the form @xmath35 . instead , it provides us with bounded - support , finite - energy wavefunctions ( signals ) that can serve as real - world , physically admissible approximations of the ideal temporally unbounded localized waves . borrowing the terminology from the numerical analysis",
    ", we may say that the description of a localized propagation - invariant wave by such a signal is convergent if the signal asymptotically approaches the localized wave structure as @xmath36 .",
    "the continuity equation @xmath37 and representation ( [ sourcecurrent ] ) immediately implies that the charge density is uniquely defined by equation @xmath38 = \\frac{1}{c\\beta } j+             \\left ( -e \\right)\\frac{\\delta \\left ( \\rho   \\right)}{2\\pi \\rho } h\\left ( \\tau   \\right)\\delta \\left ( z             \\right )             \\int_0^{\\beta \\tau}{d \\xi f \\left ( \\xi \\right ) } , \\end{split}\\ ] ] and the other non - zero component of the four - potential @xmath39  automatically satisfying @xmath40  can be obtained as a consequence of ( [ inhomogenwaveeq ] ) , ( [ timeasyminicond ] ) , and ( [ formulaforelcharge ] ) from the lorenz gauge @xmath41 by a simple integration @xmath42 here the second term describes accumulation of the opposite charge at the pulse - generation point @xmath43 due to current outflow .    for models concerning the wave emanation by hypothetical superluminal particles , tachyons",
    ", such an accumulation can be nulled if we suppose that the generation of a particle is accompanied by generation of an antiparticle ( an opposite point - like charge ) moving in different direction .    for other models involving more traditional source structures the excessive charge accumulation",
    "can be avoided in the long term by considering ( bipolar ) current pulses for which @xmath44 is vanishing or , at least , limited ( demonstrating , for example , oscillating behavior ) .",
    "one of such embodiments discussed by ziolkovski et al .",
    "@xcite and later by saari @xcite envolves superluminal sink - source - type fictitious currents @xcite . as discussed in @xcite with reference to fig .  1",
    "therein , the simplest and most straightforward implementation of the superluminal wave motion can be achieved with a type of `` scissor effect '' , creating an interference pattern of two ( luminal - speed ) plane waves whose fronts are inclined with respect to each other .",
    "similar patterns can be created , e.g. , at oblique incidence of wavefronts onto locally plane targets ( screens ) . on the cosmic scale , this phenomena is well discussed by astrophysicists ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "remarkably , recent advances in ultraintense laser interaction science enables such huge - scale phenomena to be reproduced in the micrometer scale in the laboratory conditions .",
    "excitation of a source current pulse by an ultra - intense , ultra - short pulsed laser beam , incident at an angle to a thin plasma filament  induced in a medium by another laser beam  is an example ( here significant current density can be obtained due the effects akin to the wake - field acceleration while the desired orientation of the macroscopic current along the filament can be asserted by imposing a strong magnetic field ; description of pertinent phenomena can be found in @xcite ) .",
    "separating @xmath18 by the fourier - bessel transform @xmath45 one gets from ( [ inhomogenwaveeq ] ) , ( [ timeasyminicond ] ) and ( [ sourcecurrent ] ) a simpler time asymmetric initial value problem for the klein - gordon equation @xmath46 with the initial condition @xmath47 one can easily check by direct enumeration that condition ( [ conditionforkge ] ) uniquely defines the transition to the ( characteristic ) variables @xmath48 that : ( i )  transforms the klein - gordon equation to the first canonical form and ( ii )  results in the geometry of the solution support , the area of @xmath49 , corresponding to the well - established layout of the riemann - volterra method ( see , e.g. , fig .  30 in @xcite or fig .  1 in @xcite ) .",
