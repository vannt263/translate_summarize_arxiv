    "young neutron stars are believed to be strongly magnetized , based on measurements of their spin behavior ( @xcite , and references therein ) and the polarization of their pulsed emissions ( @xcite ) .",
    "the inferred dipole fields are in the range @xmath4 g . in a broader sense ,",
    "neutron star magnetic fields of this magnitude are weak .",
    "consider , for example , a newly formed neutron star within which neutrinos of all types are temporarily trapped : near the neutrino photosphere ( neutrinosphere ) this dipole field makes only a tiny contribution to the hydrostatic stresses , @xmath5 , as compared with @xmath6 in the sun . over the last several years",
    "there has been a growing accumulation of evidence pointing to the existence of neutron stars in which the magnetic fields are so strong as to be transported rapidly throughout the core and deep crust of the star , even at the remarkably short age of @xmath7 yr .",
    "this evidence has come in several forms : the short but dramatically bright outbursts of the soft gamma repeaters ; the persistent , pulsed output of x - rays from these sources and the non - bursting anomalous x - ray pulsars ; and the rapid braking of the rotation of the sgrs and axps .",
    "these developments are exciting , in part , because direct physical measures of strong magnetic fields in isolated neutron stars such as radio pulsars have been difficult to obtain .",
    "the physical origin of magnetism in neutron stars is difficult to pin down because there are few direct observational probes of the evolving cores of massive stars .",
    "nonetheless , a simple physical argument points directly to the violent convective motions that develop in the supernova core as the predominant source of free energy .",
    "the kinetic energy carried by this convection ( both inside the neutrinosphere of the nascent neutron star , and between the neutrinosphere and the shock ) is @xmath8 times greater relative to the gravitational binding energy than it is during any convective episode driven by nuclear burning ( @xcite , hereafter td93 ) . from this perspective , the strength of the seed magnetic field ( present , e.g. , at the end of the main sequence evolution ) becomes of secondary consequence to the final disposition of magnetic fields in the neutron star .",
    "there is growing empirical evidence  from chromospheric and coronal activity in fully convective stars ( delfosse et al .",
    "1998 ; @xcite ) and from the small scale , intranetwork magnetic field of the sun ( e.g. @xcite )  that magnetic and turbulent stresses reach a dynamical balance in a fluid of very high magnetic reynolds number , even if that fluid is slowly rotating .    in this paper",
    ", we consider afresh the transport of magnetic fields in the collapsed core of a supernova .",
    "we focus in particular on the role of the intense neutrino flux in facilitating transport of magnetic fields across convectively stable layers that would otherwise bury dynamo - generated magnetic fields . before the supernova shock escapes to large radius ,",
    "the neutrinosphere is enveloped by a fairly thick layer of material ( @xmath9-@xmath10 ) which is stabilized to convection by a gradient in electron fraction @xmath11 ( keil , janka & mueller 1996 , hereafter @xcite ) . even as the shock propagates outward , a reverse shock forms that can deposit up to @xmath12 onto the neutron core over @xmath13 s ( @xcite ; fryer , colgate , & pinto 1999 , and references therein ) .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows .",
    "section 2 and the appendix give a fresh analysis of persistent convection inside the neutrinosphere of a newly formed neutron star .",
    "we focus on the forcing of convection by secular neutrino cooling , when the lepton number gradient begins to stabilize the star but a negative entropy gradient persists .",
    "we connect our calculation to those of lattimer & mazurek ( 1981 ) and reisenegger & goldreich ( 1992 ) , who calculate the brunt - visl frequency in hot and cold neutron stars .",
    "we also note that continuing fallback onto the neutron core will induce rapid convection outside the neutrinosphere that can deposit a strong ( but tangled ) magnetic field in the surface layers of the star .",
    "the rate of radial transport of a magnetic field in and around the forming neutron core is calculated in detail in section [ transport ] .",
    "turbulent pumping moves magnetic flux outward rapidly through the convective core , in the direction of decreasing turbulent diffusivity (  [ pumping ] ) outside the neutrinosphere , neutrino absorption increases the entropy of a magnetic flux rope with respect to its surroundings and allows it to move outward through a stably stratified atmosphere (  [ fivetwo ] ) . at late times , when the optically thick interior of the star is no longer convective , neutrinos induce transformations between protons and neutrons that allow a strongly magnetized parcel of fluid to move across a stablizing lepton number gradient (  [ latet ] ) .",
    "the net result is that magnetic fields stronger than @xmath14 g will rise buoyantly to the surface of a newly formed neutron star .",
    "the equilibrium configuration of a magnetic flux rope that extends outward from the convective interior of the star through the dense outer atmosphere is addressed in section 4 .",
    "we summarize in  5 the implications for pulsar magnetism , discussing the relative importance of the interior and exterior dynamos , and applying our results to the case of late fallback ( over @xmath15 s ) .",
    "the gravitational binding energy of the accreting material is converted to electron - type neutrinos , whose luminosity @xmath16 erg s@xmath17 is smaller , by about two orders of magnitude , than the luminosity emitted during the prompt @xmath18 s kelvin - helmholtz phase .",
    "nonetheless , this neutrino flux is high enough to induce many convective overturns within @xmath8 km of the neutron star ( thompson 2000 , hereafter @xcite ;  [ secfive ] ) , and thus to wind up a seed magnetic field within the accretion flow . as the result of the",
    "the supernova core is subject to a violent convective instability inside the @xmath19-sphere , driven by optically thick neutrino cooling ; and a distinct convective instability below the shock , triggered by heating by the outward - streaming neutrinos ( fig .",
    "1 ) . this second instability will persist as long as substantial accretion continues onto the neutron core , and the core remains a luminous source of neutrinos .",
    "we first show that entropy gradients will drive convection below the neutrinosphere of a young neutron star .",
    "we then consider the response of a magnetic field to instabilities either above or below the neutrinosphere .",
    "the stability of a neutron star to convection depends on gradients in both entropy and composition .",
    "the key compositional parameter is the net lepton number per baryon , @xmath20 , where @xmath11 and @xmath21 are respectively the numbers of electrons and electron neutrinos per baryon . during the first @xmath22 seconds , when the star is optically thick to neutrinos , it is unstable to convection ( @xcite ; burrows 1987 ; td93 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the ledoux criterion for convective instability is expressed most conveniently as [ ledcon ] dsdr + ( /y_l)_p , s ( /s)_p , y_ldy_ldr = dsdr - ( sy_l)_p , dy_ldr < 0 .",
    "( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it is worth explaining here why this deep convective instability is generic , because its existence has been called into question on the basis of hydrodynamical simulations of the outer neutron core , at relatively low optical depth to neutrinos ( @xcite ) .",
    "deep convection is distinct from the short - lived overturn which occurs where the weakening shock establishes a negative entropy gradient and which , according to some simulations such as those of @xcite and bruenn & mezzacappa ( 1994 ) , may be quenched by neutrino diffusion in the first 20 - 50 ms after bounce . in deep convection",
    ", the gradients of @xmath23 and @xmath24 both tend to be reduced ( e.g. @xcite ) , but are not entirely eliminated .",
    "rather , they are constantly regenerated by radiative losses from the neutrinosphere .",
    "thus , convection must continue until the magnitude of the radiative gradient drops below the adiabatic gradient .",
    "the reduction of the radiative gradient results primarily from the decrease in flux over the kelvin time , which is of order ten seconds .",
    "ledoux convection is always encouraged by negative @xmath25 , but the effect of @xmath26 on convective instability depends on the temperature and composition .",
    "negative @xmath26 is quickly established in a cooling neutron core by neutrino transport at high @xmath23 and by chemical equilibrium between electrons , protons and neutrons at at low @xmath27 ( where the lepton number is carried almost entirely by the electrons ) .",
    "the sign of the thermodynamic derivative @xmath28 is therefore crucial to the nature of the convective instability .",
    "the negative lepton - fraction gradient is de - stabilizing [ @xmath29 if the neutrino chemical potential @xmath30 is high enough _ and _ if the temperature is lower than a critical value @xmath31 .",
    "in this situation , where a compositional gradient is potentially the main driving force behind the convective instability , salt - finger effects may play an important role in its non - linear development ( @xcite ) .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath31 can be estimated analytically when the protons , neutrons , electrons , and electron neutrinos are all treated as ideal and almost degenerate fermi gases . as derived in appendix a.2 ( eq . [ [ tstarb ] ] ) ,",

    "we have scaled the density to the nuclear saturation density @xmath36 @xmath37 ( corresponding to a mass density @xmath38 g @xmath37 ) .",
    "this critical temperature is comparable to the initial peak temperature in the neutron core .",
    "negative @xmath26 induces convection below the temperature @xmath31 , but only as long as @xmath39 , or equivalently y__e > 116 y_e .",
    "in fact , @xmath21 falls below this bound quickly in the outer parts of the neutron core , in about 1 second according to the cooling models of pons et al .",
    "thereafter , the composition gradient becomes stabilizing ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; see  [ brunt ] ) .",
    "however , we now show that a negative entropy gradient can drive convection in a multicomponent , noninteracting fermi gas , even in the presence of a stabilizing composition gradient .",
    "such a `` late phase '' of convection occurs if the radiative temperature gradient is sufficiently super - adiabatic .",
    "the radiative gradient is set by the neutrino opacity , the energy flux , and the temperature : [ radiative ] f_rad=-(7n_8 ) 16_sb t^43(1n_b_r ) dtdr .",
    "here , @xmath40 is the neutrino cross section and the angular brackets indicate a rosseland mean . during the intermediate stages of cooling , the energy flux is carried primarily by @xmath41 and @xmath42 neutrinos : their opacity is due to scattering and is smaller than the absorption opacity of @xmath43 on neutrons above a temperature of @xmath22 mev ( where the absorption is not fermi - blocked by the degenerate electrons ; @xcite ) .",
    "in this situation , the effective number of neutrino species in expression ( [ radiative ] ) is @xmath44 .",
    "however , the production rate of @xmath41 and @xmath42 neutrinos may be so low that they can not carry the flux , in which case @xmath45 .",
    "a negative entropy gradient is generated by steady radiative transport , as is easily seen from the following argument .",
    "the opacity of non - degenerate neutrinos scattering from degenerate nucleons scales as @xmath46 ( as compared with the @xmath47 energy dependence of the weak neutral current in a non - degenerate plasma ; @xcite ) .",
    "the rosseland mean free path is @xmath48 for a fermi - dirac distribution of neutrinos with temperature @xmath49 and vanishing chemical potential .",
    "the mean - free path for neutron scattering is = 210 ^ 3(e _ 30  mev)^-3 at a density @xmath50 ( we normalize to fig .",
    "12 of @xcite ) .",
    "the radiative temperature gradient can , then , be directly related to the total radiative flux @xmath51 : ( dtdr)_rad = -1.3(n_2)^-1 ( l_10 ^ 52  erg  s^-1 ) ( t10  mev)^-1 ( r10  km)^-1 .",
    "this radiative gradient must be compared with the gradient required to trigger convection in the face of a ( possibly ) stablizing composition gradient .",

    "the radiative temperature gradient becomes too weak to induce convection below a luminosity @xmath64 erg s@xmath17 and temperature of @xmath65 mev .",
    "since the binding energy is @xmath66 ergs , the luminosity will be high enough to drive convection for 10 seconds or more .    unlike a main sequence star",
    ", the thermal energy in the young neutron star is not generated in the central core .",
    "heat is generated through the entire star as the lepton fraction relaxes to its equilibrium value .",
    "the absence of shock heating in the inner half of the star leads to a positive temperature gradient at small radii , which delays the onset of convection deep in the star ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , as the outer layers cool by neutrino loss , a negative entropy gradient is produced at smaller and smaller radii .",
    "the above argument shows that passive neutrino transport through a newly formed neutron star leads inevitably to convective instability .",
    "once the inconsistency of purely radiative heat transport is established , one knows that some fraction of the heat flux must be carried by convection .",
    "in other words , the negative entropy gradient is not entirely erased by the convection ( as is apparent in the simulations of kjm ) .",
    "rather , it is maintained at a large enough magnitude to carry the flux needed to supply that lost at the neutrinosphere  until the magnitude of the radiative gradient drops due to decreasing luminosity or increasing neutrino mean free path .",

    "since the ratio of magnetic energy to gravitational binding energy is approximately conserved during gravitational collapse , these violent fluid motions during the supernova event are expected to be the dominant source of free energy for pulsar magnetism .",

[ [ eqbscale ] ] ) .",
    "the bulk of the crust of a neutron star is derived from material that is either processed through the convective shell below the accretion shock ; or rises buoyantly from the deep interior of the neutron core through the convectively stable layer that straddles the @xmath19-sphere .",

    "this suggests that a prompt convective dynamo can explain the observed magnetic dipole fields of radio pulsars only if the dynamo operates stochastically  generating a true dipole component through the incoherent superposition of stronger , small scale fields ( td93 ) .",
    "even after the shock is pushed to large radius , continuing fallback ( driven by the formation of a reverse shock ) can keep the hydrostatic pressure at the surface of the nascent neutron star well above the surface value of @xmath264 inferred for the dipole fields of young radio pulsars .",

    "next , we consider how the continuing flux of electron - type neutrinos will promote the buoyancy of magnetic fields which are anchored below the final layer of accreted material .",

    "it is now straightforward to derive the critical @xmath271 above which a parcel of magnetized fluid will rise buoyantly over the infall time @xmath272 s. one obtains [ betapcrit ] _ p 1.6 _ heat_infall = 110 ^ -5(m10 ^ -4m_)^-11/10(_infall10 ^ 3  s)^-1 ( r_ns10  km)^3 ( m_ns1.4m_)^-1 from equations ( [ theat ] ) and ( [ uneu ] ) .",
    "the tiny numerical factor shows that the surface magnetic field almost certainly can not be shielded diamagnetically by the accreted material ( @xmath273 ) , because in that circumstance @xmath274 .",
    "burial is possible only if the pre - existing magnetic field undergoes partial turbulent mixing with a fraction of the accreted material , so as to force @xmath185 below the value ( [ betapcrit ] ) .",
    "at least two distinct types of hydromagnetic dynamos can give rise to the dipole magnetic fields of neutron stars .",
    "the dipole field can either be amplified by fluid stresses that are coherent over a substantial fraction of the stellar radius ( e.g. the classical @xmath275 dynamo driven by a combination of rapid differential rotation and convection ) ; or it can be built up by much smaller units that themselves are more strongly magnetized . in the convective interior of a neutron star , the first type of dynamo requires very rapid rotation , @xmath276 ms , and has been conjectured to result in magnetars with dipole fields in excess of @xmath277 g. the second type of stochastic dynamo has been conjectured to generate the small scale , intranetwork magnetic field of the sun ( td93 ; @xcite ) , but is ineffective at generating low order magnetic multipoles in a main sequence star . for example , the pressure scale height at the solar photosphere is only @xmath278 of the solar radius , which implies that the dipole flux density resulting from the incoherent superposition of the small scale dipoles is suppressed by a factor @xmath279 .",
    "by contrast , @xmath280 at the neutrinosphere of a newly formed neutron star , during the last stages of kelvin - helmholtz cooling .",
    "the corresponding suppression factor is @xmath281 .",
    "this can comfortably accommodate the dipole fields of young radio pulsars , which characteristically lie in the range @xmath282 g.    a similar stochastic dynamo may operate in the convective accretion flow onto a nascent neutron star . during _",
    "fallback , within @xmath110 s after collapse , this mechanism could generate a dipole field as large as @xmath283 gauss ( eq . [ [ bconval ] ] ) .",
    "however , the equipartition magnetic field in the convective settling flow becomes weaker with increasing fallback time ( and decreasing @xmath87 ; eq . [ [ bdipolescale ] ] ) .",
    "this means that variability in the amount of fallback is an alternative explanation for the presence of a range of dipole fields in young neutron stars  with magnetars representing those objects with the smallest amount of late fallback .",
    "it is interesting to note that the current ( uncertain ) estimates of the mass accreted during late fallback ( @xmath284 ; e.g. fryer , colgate , & pinto 1999 ) typically exceed the mass of the rigid crust in model neutron stars ( @xmath285 ) . as a result ,",
    "the field generated during fallback will tend to be anchored in the neutron star core .",
    "given the extreme difficulty of inferring the initial spins of radio pulsars , models of the dynamo origin of pulsar magnetic fields are most tightly constrained by searches for correlations between @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "the stochastic dynamo does not depend in any way on rotation , and so predicts that these two vectors are randomly oriented with respect to each other .",
    "by contrast , the magnetic field formed by a large - scale helical dynamo in a rapidly rotating neutron star should be strongly correlated with the rotation axis .",
    "in addition , a neutron star containing a toroidal magnetic field stronger than @xmath255 g ( and an external magnetic dipole that is approximately aligned with the symmetry axis of the internal field ) has a tendency to reach an alignment between @xmath287 and the external magnetic moment ( cf .",
    "goldreich 1971 ) .",
    "this effect is more likely to induce alignment in the soft gamma repeaters and anomalous x - ray pulsars , than in young radio pulsars ( duncan , li & thompson 1994 ) .",
    "a small scale magnetic field of strength @xmath288 g in radio pulsars would be manifested through sudden fractures of the neutron star crust .",
    "this phenomenon could possibly play a role in triggering glitches ( td93 ) by intermittently heating the crust , or inducing rapid translations of the coulomb lattice with with respect to the neutron superfluid .",
    "nonetheless , the absence of x - ray bursts associated with radio pulsars , combined with the seismic quiescence of old radio pulsars , suggests that if such a field is present it must be buried fairly deeply .",
    "either a radio pulsar must have accreted upwards of @xmath289 of _ weakly _ magnetized material ( @xmath290 g ) following the brief dynamo epoch ( eq . [ [ bdipolescale ] ] ) , or the high order magnetic multipoles produced by convection were effectively smoothed out .",
    "the stability of higher magnetic multipoles depends on the ability of the gravitationally stratified fluid to undergo fully three - dimensional motions ( td93 ) .",
    "stable stratification , which forces the fluid to move along the equipotential surfaces of the star , may allow more complicated magnetic topologies .",
    "however , we have shown that the absorption and emission of electron - type neutrinos facilitates the buoyant motion of magnetic fields as weak as @xmath291 g ( during the prompt kelvin - helmholtz phase of a proto - neutron star ) , and so will facilitate the reconnection and unwinding of stronger fields .    0.4 in    acknowledgements",

    "<S> material accreting onto the core is heated by neutrinos and also becomes strongly convective . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the expected magnetic stresses in this convective ` gain layer ' with those deep inside the neutron core .    </S>",
    "<S> buoyant motions of magnetized fluid are greatly aided by the intense neutrino flux . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the transport rate through a medium containing free neutrons , protons , and electrons , in the limiting cases of degenerate or non - degenerate nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> fields stronger than @xmath2 g are able to rise through the outer degenerate layers of the neutron core during the last stages of kelvin - helmholtz cooling ( up to 10 seconds post - collapse ) , even though these layers have become stable to convection . </S>",
    "<S> we also find the equilibrium shape of a thin magnetic flux rope in the dense hydrostatic atmosphere of the neutron star , along with the critical separation of the footpoints above which the rope undergoes unlimited expansion against gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the implications of these results for pulsar magnetism are summarized , and applied to the case of late fallback over the first @xmath3 s of the life of a neutron star .    v     .3 in    _ astrophysical journal , in press _ </S>"
