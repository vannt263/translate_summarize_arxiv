    "in the last decade there is a renewed interest for studying the fingerprints of pairing correlations in the thermodynamic properties of excited nuclei .",
    "this interest was triggered by the new accurate measurements of level density at low excitation energies .",
    "thus , a special attention was payed lately to the influence of pairing on the low - temperature behavior of the specific heat in the isotopes @xmath0dy and @xmath1yb , extracted from the level density measurements performed by the oslo group @xcite .",
    "the possible thermal signatures of pairing correlations in these rare earth isotopes have been studied either with schematic models or employing various approximations which go beyond the standard bcs approach .",
    "as it is by now well documented , due to its drawbacks , i.e. , particle number fluctuation and quasiparticle parity mixing , the bcs theory is not well - suited to describe pairing effects in hot nuclei .",
    "one alternative to cure these drawbacks is to use the particle - number projected bcs approximation extended to finite temperature .",
    "how this approximation can be implemented for performing variation after projection calculations at finite temperature ( ft - vap ) was recently discussed in ref @xcite .",
    "this approach will be applied here to investigate the effect of pairing on thermal properties of dy and yb isotopes mentioned above .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was argued that the s - shaped form of the specific heat in dy and yb isotopes is generated by the transition from the superfluid to the normal phase .",
    "this conclusion was drawn by the comparison with the specific heat of a non - interacting fermi gas which was described by the back - shifted bethe formula @xcite . however , this comparison is misleading because the bethe formula is not valid for low energy excitations ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , where the pairing correlations are expected to be important . in this study",
    "we shall re - analyze this issue in the framework of ft - vap approximation and using for low energy excitations level densities extracted from self - consistent mean field calculations .",
    "the article has the following structure .",
    "first , we present the calculation scheme we use to evaluate the thermodynamic properties of nuclei related to the pairing interaction . afterwards , using single - particle spectra generated by self - consistent mean field models , we analyze the effect of pairing on the partition function and heat capacity .",
    "finally , a critical discussion on the comparison with experimental data is made .",
    "to analyze the effects of pairing correlations upon the thermodynamic properties of hot nuclei we consider the hamiltonian : @xmath2 where the second term is the pairing interaction which scatters pairs among time - reversed single - particle states @xmath3 .",
    "this hamiltonian can be used for realistic description of pairing correlations in heavy nuclei for which proton - neutron pairing can be neglected .    for many years",
    "the pairing correlations in hot nuclei have been described in the framework of finite - temperature bcs / hfb models ( ft - bcs / hfb ) @xcite",
    ". however , ft - bcs is the proper theory for infinite systems but not for finite systems such as atomic nuclei .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that ft - bcs predicts a sharp ( second order ) superfluid - normal phase transition , in contrast to a smooth transition , as expected in hot nuclei @xcite .",
    "this drawback of ft - bcs is related to the improper treatment of particle number conservation , pleading in favor of approaches that explicitly conserve particle number .",
    "several calculation schemes have been proposed along this line , e.g. , based on shell - model monte - carlo ( smmc ) calculations @xcite or the method proposed recently in ref",
    ". @xcite . in the present study",
    "we shall explore a variational method which is the generalization of the particle - number projected bcs model to finite temperature .",
    "this method , called below finite - temperature variation after projection ( ft - vap ) approach , has been recently tested @xcite in the case of schematic pairing models . here",
    "the ft - vap approach will be extended and applied to describe thermodynamic properties of hot nuclei . in order to test the validity of ft - vap in realistic applications ,",
    "we perform also thermodynamic calculations based on the spectrum of the pairing hamiltonian ( [ hamn ] ) obtained by direct diagonalization .      in the applications presented below the single - particle ( s.p .",
    ") states employed in the hamiltonian ( [ hamn ] ) are taken from mean - field models .",
    "thus , we have used two sets of s.p .",
    "states obtained , respectively , from skyrme - hartree - fock ( hf ) and relativistic mean - field ( rmf ) calculations allowing , in both cases , axial symmetry deformation .",
    "the skyrme - hf equations are solved with the code ev8 @xcite and using the force sly4 @xcite while the rmf calculations are done with the force pk1 @xcite .",
    "energies around the fermi energy for the isotopes @xmath4dy and @xmath5yb obtained in skyrme - hf and rmf @xcite calculations are shown in figure 1 .",
    "these energies are also considered in the calculations done for the odd isotopes @xmath6dy and @xmath7yb . in hf and rmf calculations",
    "a deformation of about @xmath8 is found both for @xmath4dy and @xmath5yb , @xmath9 being defined by @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the mass number , @xmath12 and @xmath13 is the quadrupole operator .",

    "the matrix elements of the pairing interaction are taken equal to a constant strength , i.e. , @xmath14 . in the calculations presented below for dy and yb isotopes we have considered an energy window of 3 mev .",
    "the pairing strength @xmath15 is fixed at bcs level in order to give a pairing gap approximately equal to @xmath16 mev both for protons and neutrons .",

    "such approach is certainly the most direct way to describe statistical properties of pairing at fixed particle number .",
    "however , this approach can be only applied at low temperatures because only in this case the pairing active window can be taken small enough for allowing exact diagonalization .",
    "alternatively , the statistical properties of pairing interaction are usually investigated in the framework of quasiparticle models , such as bcs or hfb , in which the excitations can be easily obtained and the pairing gap is built from outset .",
    "thus , in the finite - temperature bcs ( ft - bcs ) approximation the partition function ( [ excitation - partition ] ) is calculated with the bcs effective hamiltonian while the variation of the pairing correlations with the temperature are characterized by the pairing gap ( see for example @xcite ) . for illustration , in the top panel of fig .",

    "[ fig : allgaps ]    the results corresponds to the rmf s.p . spectrum . as can be seen , the ft - bcs predicts a sharp second order type transition from the superfluid to the normal phase , at variance with what it is expected for small finite systems .",
    "as it is well known , the sharp transition predicted by ft - bcs is connected to the breaking of particle number conservation , leading automatically to a grand - canonical treatment instead of a canonical one .",
    "a more involved but more appropriate approach , which keeps the physical insight of quasiparticle models , can be obtained working with the particle number projected density @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 is the bcs effective hamiltonian , and @xmath34 is the projector onto good particle number .",

    "<S> the pairing gap and the specific heat calculated in the ft - vap approach vary smoothly with the temperature , indicating a gradual transition from the superfluid to the normal phase , as expected in finite systems . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the predictions of the ft - vap approach are very accurate when compared to the results obtained by an exact diagonalization of the pairing hamiltonian . </S>",
    "<S> the influence of pairing correlations on specific heat is analysed for the isotopes @xmath0dy and @xmath1yb . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the ft - vap approach , applied with a level density provided by mean field calculations and supplemented , at high energies , by the level density of the back - shifted fermi gas model , can approximate reasonably well the main properties of specific heat extracted from experimental data </S>",
    "<S> . however , the detailed shape of the calculated specific heat is rather sensitive to the assumption made for the mean field . </S>"
