    "it is a well - known experimental fact that highly negative ions do not exist : in fact , a neutral atom can bind at most one or two additional electrons .",

    "the constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 are positive numbers , whose precise values are not important in our analysis .",
    "the first and the last terms in @xmath2 are the semiclassical approximations of the kinetic energy and the self - interaction energy of electrons .",
    "they were introduced independently by thomas @xcite and fermi @xcite in 1927 in their celebrated theory for the electron distribution in atoms and molecules .",
    "although the thomas - fermi theory captures the precise leading order of the ground state energy of large systems @xcite , it has some serious defects , most notably teller s no - binding theorem @xcite and the absence of negative ions .",
    "therefore , further corrections are necessary . in 1930 , dirac @xcite proposed the correction @xmath10 which models the exchange energy and in 1935 , von weizscker suggested the correction @xmath11 to the kinetic energy . when only one of these two corrections is taken into account ,",
    "we are left with the thomas - fermi - dirac and the thomas - fermi - von weizscker theories .",
    "the simultaneous appearance of two corrections makes the tfdw theory more precise but also more difficult to analyze than its ancestors .",
    "we refer to @xcite for a pedagogical introduction to these density functional theories and their connections to many - body quantum mechanics .",
