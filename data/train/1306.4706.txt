    "the ability to use optical lattices to study the properties of ultracold atoms provides a testing model to simulate different strongly - correlated fermi systems .",
    "optical lattices are also tailored - made to study the effects of dimensionality on correlated fermi systems as the former are created by standing laser waves in one , two or three dimensions @xcite .",
    "since the frequency and intensity of the lasers can be tuned up to specific values , the properties of ultracold fermi or bose systems loaded onto these lattices can be studied with impressive detail @xcite .",
    "in addition , when the atoms are near a feshbach resonance their interaction can be finely tuned to explore the crossover from the weakly - interacting bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) regime characterized by cooper pair formation to the strongly - interacting regime where the formation of molecular pairs with zero spin can undergo a bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) at sufficiently low temperatures @xcite .",
    "although most experimental and theoretical models of correlated fermi systems have dealt with balanced populations of spin states , more recently @xcite the ability to manipulate ultracold atomic clouds has motivated the interest to study systems when the mixture of two hyperfine states in , for example , an atomic fermi gas is not balanced . in this case , the two fermi surfaces are no longer aligned and the lowest energy pairs have non - zero total momenta .",
    "such phases were first studied by fulde and ferrell ( ff ) @xcite , who used an order parameter that varies as a single plane wave , and by larkin and ovchinnikov ( lo ) @xcite , who suggested that the order parameter is a superposition of two plane waves .",
    "although the ff and lo phases ( presently referred as fflo ) were introduced quite a long time ago , they are still of very high interest because the question whether the superconductivity / superfluidity can survive in 3d polarized systems remains experimentally unanswered . in the fflo phase",

    "the mean - field treatment of the fflo phase in a variety of systems , such as superconductors with zeeman splitting and heavy - fermion superconductors sc , atomic fermi gases with population imbalance loaded in optical lattices @xcite and harmonic traps @xcite , and dense quark matter @xcite shows that the fflo phase competes with a number of other phases , such as the sarma ( @xmath6 ) states @xcite , but in some regions of momentum space the fflo phase is more stable as it provides the minimum of the mean - field expression of the helmholtz free energy .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the polarization dependence of the gap , chemical potentials and pair - momentum as well as the collective excitations of an imbalanced mixture of two hyperfine states @xmath7 and @xmath8 of a @xmath0li atomic fermi gas under an attractive contact interaction loaded into a cubic optical lattice .    in section",
    "ii we summarize the properties of the hubbard hamiltonian used here to model a two - component fermi gas in a lattice produced by standing waves of three pairs of counter - propagating laser beams .",
    "section iii is devoted to the calculation of the thermodynamic potential of the system . when the number of particles is fixed , the helmholtz free energy is obtained as a function of the order parameter and total pair momentum .",
    "we also analyze the extent of the phase separation region determined by the minimal free energy of a normal and a bcs mixture . the polarization _ vs _ temperature phase diagram is calculated and compared with previous results for a 2d system @xcite . in section iv we derive a bethe - salpeter equation for two - body amplitudes assuming a generalized random - phase approximation .",

    "<S> we study fermion pairing in a population - imbalanced mixture of @xmath0li atomic gas loaded in a three - dimensional lattice at very low temperatures . using the number equation for each population , the gap equation and the equation for the helmholtz free energy </S>",
    "<S> , we determine the gap , chemical potentials and pair - momentum as functions of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters define the stability regions for : a fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov phase ; a phase separation region where bcs and normal phases coexist ; a sarma phase when the pair - momentum vanishes , and the transition to the normal phase when the gap disappears . </S>",
    "<S> the collective - mode energies are then calculated using a bethe - salpeter approach in the generalized random phase approximation assuming that the system is well described by the single - band hubbard model . </S>",
    "<S> a novel result is that this fermionic gas has a superfluid phase revealed by rotonlike minima in the asymmetric collective - mode energy spectrum . </S>"
