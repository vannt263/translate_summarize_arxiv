    "a nonextensive entropy definition was proposed in 1988 [ 1 ] by tsallis , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a positive constant , _",
    "p_@xmath4  is the probability of the system in the _ i _ th microstate , _ w _  is the total number of the configurations of the system and _ q _ is any real number .",
    "since then , tsallis thermostatistics ( tt ) has commonly been used for the investigation of the physical systems . as well - known , boltzmann - gibbs ( bg ) statistics is a powerful one to study a variety of the physical systems .",
    "however it falls for the systems which @xmath5 have long - ranged interactions , @xmath6 have long - ranged memory effects , and @xmath7 evolve in multifractal space - time . in this manner , it has been understood that extensive bg statistics fails to study nonextensive physical systems not having these conditions .",
    "consequently the standard bg thermostatistics is not universal and is appropriate for extensive systems .",
    "the parameter , @xmath0 , in eq.(1 ) is called the entropy index and measures the degree of the nonextensivity of the system under consideration .",
    "after a few years from 1988 , the formalism was revised [ 2 ] introducing the unnormalized constraint to the internal energy .",
    "this generalization included the celebrated bg thermostatistics , which could be recovered when @xmath8 .",
    "after this work , this formalism has been commonly employed to study various physical systems .",
    "some of them can be given such as ; self gravitating systems [ 3,4 ] , turbulence [ 5 - 8 ] , anomalous diffusion [ 9 - 12 ] , solar neutrinos [ 13 ] , liquid crystals [ 14 - 18 ] etc .    in spite of the successes of tt , some drawbacks were noted in the original formalism . these can be summarized as follows : @xmath9 the density operator was not invariant under a uniform translation of energy spectrum , @xmath10 the @xmath0-expected value of the identity operator was not the unity , @xmath11 the energy of the physical system was not conserved .",
    "to overcome these difficulties , tsallis et al .",
    "introduced the normalized constraint to the internal energy of the system [ 19 ] : @xmath12 the optimization of tsallis entropy given by eq.(1 ) according to this internal energy constraint results in @xmath13 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}}}{z_{q}}\\ ] ] with @xmath14 ^{\\frac{1}{1-q}},\\ ] ] where @xmath15    therefore the @xmath0-expectation value of any observable is defined as @xmath16 where @xmath17 represents any observable quantity which commutes with hamiltonian .",
    "as can be expected , the @xmath0-expectation value of the observable reduces to the conventional one when @xmath8 .",
    "as for our motivation in this study , it was found in literature [ 20 ] that the structure of the micellar and liquid crystalline phases can be considered as self - similar .",
    "based on this fact , recently a model of self - similar aggregation of alkylbenzenesulphonates ( abs ) molecules was proposed [ 21 ] .",
    "then the fractal structure of the sample was investigated experimentally [ 20 ] where the influence of the geometry of abs molecules on the formation of their liquid crystalline phases was reported and the authors emphasized that abs molecules are the fractal objects .",
    "as mentioned above , the nonextensivity may appear in systems where fractality exists .",
    "therefore the main motivation of the present study comes from having fractal structure of some liquid crystals .    as well - known from the literature and our last studies on nematic liquid crystals , maier - saupe theory ( mst ) , which is a mean - field one , has some insufficiencies coming from ; 1 ) as being a mean - field theory , 2 ) neglecting higher interaction terms in the interaction potential function . due to these insufficiencies",
    ", mst gives , for instance , the critical value of the long range order parameter @xmath18 for all nematics .",
    "considering these terms ( i.e. the possibility of the fractality in liquid crystals and the insufficiencies of the mean - field approach ) , we apply tt to the nematic liquid crystals . to this end , in [ 14 ] , mst was generalized within tt and it was showed the influences of the nonextensivity on the nematic - isotropic transition . next the dimerization process was handled using tt in [ 15 ] which can be regarded as the first application of tt to a liquid crystalline system . in [ 15 ] , the influence of the dimerization process on the nematic ordering is investigated by using a nonextensive thermostatistics ( tt ) .",
    "a theoretical model taking into account the dimerization influence on the nematic scalar order parameter has been summarized and theoretical predictions for the nematic order parameter are improved by using tt . then the @xmath19 model with @xmath19-interaction ( @xmath19 indicates the legendre polynomial for @xmath20 ) was investigated and generalized within tt in [ 16 ] .",
    "the dependence of the second order parameter ( @xmath21 ) on the fourth one ( @xmath22 ) was studied  in [ 17 ] and the generalized theory was applied to paa ( para - azoxyanisole ) , a nematic liquid crystal . in [ 18 ] ,",
    "a generalized mean - field theory was presented relating helix tilt in a bilayer to lipid disorder .",
    "it has been observed from all these studies that if one uses a generalized form of the mst within tt , the deviations between the theory ( mst ) and the experimental data are minimized and the obtained results agree with the experimantal data very well .    in this study , the influence of the photoisomerization on the orientational ordering is handled by using a generalized theory .",
    "the standard theory has been recently proposed in literature [ 22 ] .",
    "it is an extension of the mst and could be an appropriate one to investigate the variation of the concentration of @xmath1 isomers and of the scalar order parameter with the time of exposure to the illumination . as expected , as it is an extension of a mean - field theory ( mst ) , it might have some deviations form the experimental data ; for instance it also gives a universal value of the long range order parameter at transition point , @xmath23 . to overcome similar insufficiencies ( considering the possible fractality of the liquid crystalline system )",
    ", we use a generalized form of the standard theory and investigate the physical quantities concerning physical system .  to this end , we first summarize the standard and generalized theories . then we investigate the effects of nonextensivity on the nematic - isotropic transition and also on the evolution of the concentration of @xmath1 isomers and of the scalar order parameter with the time of exposure to the illumination .",
    "the standard theory [ 22 ] assumes that the liquid crystalline system is formed by a mixture of two elements , namely two miscible nematogens @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "according to the system under consideration can be dimers and monomers , if an energy to break the hydrogen bonding is considered [ 23 ] , or trans and cis isomers in the case of azobenzene materials [ 24 ] .",
    "both kinds of molecules , namely @xmath24 and @xmath25 , are supposed to be rodlike . in the mean - field approximation , the total nematic potential function can be given by [ 25 - 27 ] @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the angles formed by the molecular long axes of the molecules of @xmath24 and @xmath25 with the nematic director of the mixture respectively , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the mean - field potentials acting on a molcule of @xmath24 due to the other molecules of @xmath31 and due to the molecules of @xmath25 respectively .",
    "a similar meaning has @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "these potential functions can be written as @xmath34 in the mst , where @xmath35 s are coupling constants and they depend on the distance between the center of mass of the molecules , on a molecular property and also on the concentration of one of the constituents in the system [ 23 ] . using these terms above , we can write the nematic potential function as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the scalar order parameters of the molecules of @xmath38 .",
    "the scalar order parameters are determined by solving the set of coupled equations according to eq.(5 ) for @xmath39 self consistently .",
    "these coupled equations depend on the temperature @xmath40 and on the quantities @xmath41 appearing in the nematic potential function .",
    "the @xmath35  quantities contain the strengths of mean - field interaction among the molecules forming the nematic @xmath42 , among the molecules forming the nematic @xmath43 , and among the molecules of @xmath42 and those of @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 are assumed as @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 , with @xmath49 being the number of molecules of the nematic @xmath50 [ 23 ] .",
    "the generalized free energy of the system is given by @xmath51 where @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "since we assume @xmath54 , the free energy density of the system can be given by @xmath55 + un_{1}n_{2}p_{2}\\left ( \\theta _ { 1}\\right ) p_{2}\\left ( \\theta _ { 2}\\right ) \\right\\ } , \\ ] ] where @xmath56 .",
    "let us now consider the case in which one of the constituents do not contribute to the nematic order .",
    "the experimental evidence shows that the molecules of the cis isomers are of banana shape . according to  recent investigations ,",
    "this banana shape can be approximated by two linear parts forming an angle between them not very far from @xmath57 [ 22 ] . as a result of this configuration ,",
    "the molecules of the cis isomer behave as spherical objects due to the spinning and tumbling motions of thermal origin .",
    "consequently in the liquid phase they can originate just an isotropic phase . in this manner ,",
    "the molecules of cis isomer lead to a kind of neutral background , where the molecules of trans isomer are responsible for nematic order .",
    "so we will consider that the trans isomers have cylindrical symmetry and can exhibit a nematic order , whereas the cis isomers will tend to reduce this orientational order .",
    "in addition , we also assume that at zero temperature the system under consideration is made by @xmath58 isomers . at a given temperature @xmath40",
    "we have @xmath59 where @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the equilibrium concentration of trans and cis isomers and are given by @xmath62 at a given temperature respectively .",
    "thus the quantities @xmath35 are reduced to the case of trans isomer - trans isomer interaction , i.e. , @xmath63 and @xmath64 [ 23 ] .    in the case of one component , @xmath65  will be the scalar order parameter of trans isomers .",
    "the standard theory is based on mst with a ingredient represented by temperature - dependent concentration .",
    "this dependence in the standard theory plays an important role and it departs from the one represented by the concentration dependence characteristic of the excluded volume theories of onsager type [ 28,29 ] . as well - known , in onsager model the number of particle is fixed . in this manner , the critical density , below which the isotropic phase is stable , follows from a balance between the energy connected with the excluded volume and the thermal energy .",
    "in contrast , according to the standard model which will be generalized below , the number of particles responsible for the nematic phase depends on the temperature . in onsager",
    "s theory , this is equivalent to having an excluded volume that is temperature dependent .    in fig.(1 ) , we show the dependence of the long range order parameter on the concentration of cis isomers for a fixed reduced temperature @xmath66 and for some @xmath0 values . the nematic scalar order parameter vs. the concentration of the cis isomers in the system for @xmath66 ( reduced temperature ) is illustrated in fig.(1 ) .",
    "since the standard theory ( @xmath8 ) depends on maier - saupe mean - field interaction energy , the system , as expected , exhibits a first - order phase transition to the isotropic phase for @xmath67 and @xmath68 decreases suddenly to zero from @xmath23 which mst gives for all nematic liquid crystals .",
    "however it is experimentally known [ 30 ] that the critical value of the nematic order parameter varies from one nematic to the other and it lies in a range of @xmath69 for nematic liquid crystals .",
    "we think therefore that the standard model based on mean - field approach appears to be insufficient and alternative approach is needed . on the other hand ,",
    "as @xmath0 is varied , we observe that the critical value of the order parameter changes .",
    "the obtained results are summarized in table in which the entropy change at transition point is also reported as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the entropy of the system as @xmath70 .    in fig.(2 ) , the phase diagram of temperature vs. concentration of cis component for the system is plotted .",
    "one observes that the usual critical temperature ( @xmath71 ) for mst [ 31 ] is reached when @xmath72 as expected , since the concentration of the molecules leading to the nematic phase is fixed in mst .",
    "an interesting point is that the experimental data reported in [ 25 ] show that the critical temperature for the nematic - isotropic phase transition of the mixture is a linear function of the concentration of the solute . in this framework",
    ", we observe from fig.(2 ) that the entropic index @xmath0 just affects the slope of the line associated with this linear dependency .",
    "at a given temperature , the isomerization reaction follows the reaction scheme @xmath73 , depending on some rate constants that , in turn , depend on the intensity of the light in the illumination process [ 32,33 ]",
    ". then time variation of the concentrations of two constituents can be approximated by @xmath74 within tt , where @xmath75 is a characteristic time and @xmath76 is a parameter to control the fraction of trans - cis isomers at a given temperature after the illumination .",
    "when @xmath77 , we have @xmath78 . from @xmath79 and assuming for @xmath60 the approximate expression given by eq.(13 ) , we obtain @xmath80 it is the experimental fact that with the exposure time to the illumination , the concentration of cis isomers increases , whereas the trans isomer concentration does not tend to zero , but to some fraction , controlled by the parameter @xmath76 , of the equilibrium concentration @xmath81 .",
    "now we would like to discuss about the equilibrium distribution of the concentrations of the different constituents forming the mixture . at a given temperature",
    ", the equilibrium distributions of cis and trans isomers in tt could be given by @xmath82 respectively , where @xmath83 is the chemical potential of the mixture .",
    "now if the above results are used in eq.(12 ) , it is possible to observe the behaviour of the order parameter with the exposure time to the illumination . in fig.(3 ) , we illustrate the variation of the order parameter with the exposure time for the reduced temperature of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and for some @xmath0 values .",
    "we observe that for a given value of c , the entropic index @xmath86 plays an important role and has a considerable effect on the variation of scalar order parameter with the exposure time .",
    "the similar behaviour can be easily seen in fig.(4 ) in which the order parameter vs. exposure time is plotted for @xmath87 and some values of @xmath0 .",
    "probably the most interesting result is seen in fig.(5 ) ; for @xmath8 ( standard theory ) and @xmath88 , there is no phase transition at temperature @xmath84 .",
    "however for @xmath89 and @xmath90 , a first order phase transition occurs at this temperature ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "this conclusion implies that the permenance of the liquid crystalline phase depends not only on the concentration of cis isomers in the system , but also on the entropic index @xmath0 ( i.e. probably long range interactions or fractality ) .",
    "@xmath91    table .",
    "we have presented a generalized model to study on the behaviour of the scalar order parameter in liquid crystalline systems , consisting of more than one nematogen component .",
    "it is the experimental fact that some liquid crystals have fractal structure .",
    "this fact implies that tt can be applied to the liquid crystalline systems .",
    "in addition ,  the standard model , which has been generalized , is an extension of mst and thus some drawbacks coming from insufficiencies of mean - field approach could be expected . in this framework ,",
    "a generalized model which is an extension of mst has been used .",
    "the generalized theory  can be successfully applied to distinct systems , such as one formed by cyclic dimers and monomers , and also to the systems where azobenzene compounds play an important role .",
    "for example , a similar system , consisting of closed and open dimers , has been studied in [ 15 ] , where the experimental data related to the dimeric system has been successfully explained by using a generalized theory .",
    "it must be noted that the success of the generalized mean - field theories in our earlier studies may come from being fractal structure of liquid crystals , apart from considering long range interactions .",
    "similar successful explanations can be expected in other dimeric and liquid crystalline systems .",
    "it has been also studied on the systems where the illumination process gives rise to the appearance of new objects with different symmetries in the systems .",
    "we have shown that fractality or long range interactions ( i.e. @xmath92 ) might affect the characteristics of the phase transition in the physical system .",
    "this conclusion might shed light on the interaction potential energy terms or fractal structure in the similar system in future possible experiments , even to be performed on new objects with different symmetries .",
