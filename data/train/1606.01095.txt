    "et al_.  @xcite studied the ( low- and mid - latency ) prospects for sky localization .",
    "et al_.  @xcite repeated the analysis using more realistic noise ( detector noise from the sixth science run of initial ligo @xcite recoloured to match the expected sensitivity of early aligo @xcite ) , in contrast to ideal gaussian noise .",
    "in addition to considering sky localization , berry _ et al_.  @xcite also investigated measurements of source distance and mass .",

    "sky localization can be computed at low - latency by bayestar @xcite or at mid- to high - latency by lalinference @xcite .. ] both are fully bayesian pe codes ; bayestar uses the output of the detection pipeline , while lalinference matches gw templates to the measured detector strain @xcite .",
    "computing templates is computationally expensive ; mid - latency pe is done with ( non - spinning ) taylorf2 and high - latency pe is done with ( fully spin - precessing ) spintaylort4",
    ". both are inspiral - only post - newtonian waveforms @xcite .",
    "bayestar takes a median time of @xmath4 to calculate the location @xcite ; the median times for the non - spinning and spinning lalinference analyses to collect @xmath5 posterior samples are @xmath6 @xcite and @xmath7 @xcite respectively .    despite their differences ,",
    "bayestar and lalinference produce consistent results for a two - detector network .",
    "the inclusion of spin in pe does not change sky localization for this slowly spinning population ( the same may not be true for rapidly spinning black holes ) . at a constant signal - to - noise ratio ( snr )",

    "[ fig : offset ] shows the offset between chirp - mass estimates ( maximum likelihood values for gstlal and posterior means for lalinference ) and the true values .",
    "all methods produce accurate results ( offsets @xmath29 ) and there is no noticeable difference between recoloured and gaussian noise .",
    "the mid - latency offsets are smaller than the high - latency ones , because our bnss are slowly spinning ( which need not be the case in reality ) . however , the mid - latency offsets are more statistically significant .",
    "the mean values of @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the posterior standard deviation , are @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the recoloured non - spinning , gaussian non - spinning and gaussian spinning analyses respectively . ignoring spin yields posteriors that are too narrow @xcite , the distribution of @xmath31 is shown in fig .",

    "measurements of other mass parameters , such as the mass ratio @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) or @xmath25 , are less precise , and the degeneracy with spin is more pronounced @xcite : the median @xmath9 ( @xmath11 ) credible interval for @xmath40 is @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) . for our population of low - spin bnss ,",
