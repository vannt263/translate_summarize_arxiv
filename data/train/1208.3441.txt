    "these axioms are the conditions required to ensure that each labeling of an oriented framed knot or link diagram according to the semiarc labeling rule above before a framed oriented reidemeister move corresponds to a unique such labeling after the move . by construction",

    "the bijection @xmath11 defined by @xmath12 represents going through a positive kink : @xmath13 this bijection @xmath14 , called the _ kink map _ , is an element of the symmetric group on @xmath1 ; if @xmath1 is finite , then @xmath14 has a finite exponent @xmath15 such that @xmath16 for all @xmath17 .",

    "@xmath22 on a link of @xmath23 components , we can specify framings with framing vectors @xmath24 where the @xmath25th component of @xmath26 is the number of times the @xmath25th component crosses over itself at a positive crossing minus the number of times the @xmath25th component crosses over itself at a negative crossing .",

[ ex0 ]    given an @xmath1-labeling @xmath58 of an oriented framed link diagram @xmath28 and a @xmath0$]-module @xmath59 , we can give the semiarcs in @xmath28 a secondary labeling by elements of @xmath59 , usually visualized as beads : @xmath60 the ideal @xmath53 in definition [ def2 ] is chosen so that bead labelings before and after @xmath1-labeled framed reidemeister and @xmath18-phone cord moves are in one - to - one correspondence .",

    "the greatest common divisor of the @xmath72-minors of @xmath67 with respect to a fixed choice of term ordering , denoted @xmath73 is a generator for the minimal principal ideal @xmath74 containing @xmath70 .",
    "if @xmath67 is a square matrix , then @xmath75 is simply the determinant of @xmath59 .",
    "we note that @xmath76 extends to virtual knots and links in the usual way , i.e. , by ignoring the virtual crossings .",
    "see @xcite for more . by construction",

    "the examples we have selected for inclusion in this paper use biracks and polynomial birack modules of small cardinality for speed of computation and convenience of presentation ; even so , the @xmath76 invariant appears to be quite effective at distinguishing virtual knots with only these small @xmath59 and @xmath1 . we anticipate that biracks of larger cardinality and polynomial birack modules with more variables or over larger rings should be even more effective at distinguishing knots and links .",
