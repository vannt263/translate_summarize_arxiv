    "it is also intended to force that if we add in a new cardinal @xmath93 and add condition @xmath360 between @xmath358 and @xmath361 then there is a pair @xmath362 in some @xmath363 such that @xmath364 and @xmath365 .",
    "this motivates the ordering ( which we do not spell out in detail here ) ; a condition is refined either by refining the `` constraint parts '' or by adding in new quintuples that obey the current constraints and which impose constraints compatible with the current ones .",
    "the key fact about @xmath123 is that given a condition @xmath115 , any question about the generic extension can be decided by refining the constraint parts of @xmath115 ( this is modelled on prikry s well - known lemma about prikry forcing ) .",

    "it remains to be seen that forcing with @xmath123 preserves the large cardinal character of @xmath29 ; this is done via a master condition argument which succeeds because @xmath366 is quite long ( it has a so - called _ repeat point _ ) and the forcing @xmath367 is @xmath368-directed - closed .",

    "our modification of @xcite is simply to restrict attention to those pairs @xmath374 such that @xmath375 is sweet ( there are sufficiently many because @xmath376 is sweet in @xmath5 ) and then to replace the forcing @xmath377 by the forcing @xmath378 .",
    "it turns out that the proofs in @xcite go through essentially unaltered , because they only make appeal to rather general properties ( chain condition , distributivity , directed closure ) of cohen forcing .",
    "there is one slightly subtle point , which is that is we will need a certain uniformity in the dependence of @xmath272 on @xmath178 , as expressed by the equation @xmath379 .",
