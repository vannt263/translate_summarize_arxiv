    "a timelike surface in the 3-dimensional lorentz - minkowski space @xmath1 is a surface whose first fundamental form is a lorentzian metric .",
    "in contrast to surfaces in the 3-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 and spacelike surfaces in @xmath1 , timelike surfaces have not always real principal curvatures , that is , their shape operators are not always diagonalizable even over the complex number field @xmath3 . in general the diagonalizability of the shape operator of a timelike surface",
    "is determined by the discriminant of the characteristic equation for the shape operator , which is @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mean curvature and @xmath6 is the gaussian curvature of a timelike surface . in this paper",
    "we consider the case that @xmath5 vanishes identically .",
    "a timelike surface whose mean curvature vanishes identically is called a _ timelike minimal surface _ and mcnertney @xcite proved that any such surface can be expressed as the sum of two _ null curves _",
    "( see also fact [ fact : mcnertney ] ) , where a null curve is a regular curve whose velocity vector field is lightlike . for timelike minimal surfaces ,",
    "several kinds of representation formulas with or without singular points have been obtained as follows : magid @xcite derived a weierstrass - type representation formula for timelike minimal surfaces with null coordinate systems .",
    "inoguchi and toda @xcite studied timelike minimal surfaces via a loop group method and derived a normalized version of the weierstrass representation formula in @xcite .",
    "konderak @xcite derived a global version of weierstrass - type representation formula by using the notion of paracomplex numbers .",
    "after that kim , koh , shin , and yang @xcite introduced the notion of _ generalized timelike minimal surfaces _ with singular points of rank zero ( branch points ) and rank one .",
    "this notion corresponds to the notion of _ generalized maximal surfaces _ introduced in @xcite for spacelike case , where a spacelike surface whose mean curvature vanishes identically is called a _",
    "maximal surface_. moreover they gave regular and singular bjrling formulas for such surfaces .",
    "on the other hand , based on the studies @xcite for spacelike case , takahashi @xcite also introduced the notion of timelike minimal surfaces with some kind of singular points of rank one , which are called _ minfaces _ ( see definition [ def : minface0 ] and definition [ def : minface ] ) .",
    "the notion of minfaces corresponds to the notion of _ maxfaces _ which was introduced in @xcite as a class of spacelike maximal surfaces with singular points of rank one .",
    "moreover , takahashi also gave criteria for cuspidal edges , swallowtails , and cuspidal cross caps which appear frequently on minfaces by using a weierstrass - type representation formula for minfaces .",
    "we should remark that timelike minimal surfaces have been also studied from the viewpoint of the string theory , see , for example , @xcite and their references .",
    "the diagonalizability of the shape operator of a timelike minimal surface is determined by the sign of the gaussian curvature @xmath6 .",
    "more precisely the shape operator is diagonalizable over the real number field @xmath7 on points with negative gaussian curvature and diagonalizable over @xmath8 on points with positive gaussian curvature .",
    "flat points consist of umbilic points and _ quasi - umbilic points _",
    "( see definition [ def : quasi - umbilic ] ) .",
    "therefore the problem of the diagonalizability of the shape operator of a timelike minimal surface is reduced to the problem of the sign of the gaussian curvature . in this paper",
    "we investigate how to determine the sign of the gaussian curvature of a timelike minimal surface from a viewpoint of null curves .",
    "in other words , we determine when a timelike minimal surface has real principal curvatures or complex principal curvatures .",
    "moreover , if a timelike minimal surface has some kind of singular points , we determine the behavior of the gaussian curvature near these singular points .    to achieve our goals , we first give a characterization of flat points of a timelike minimal surface by the notion of non - degeneracy of null curves which generate the surface ( proposition [ prop : flat points ] ) .",
    "near non - flat points , we also prove that the sign of the gaussian curvature is determined only by the _",
    "orientations _ of two generating null curves ( see definition [ ori ] ) .",
    "essentially this result was obtained by milnor @xcite .",
    "in addition to this result , by using the notion of pseudo - arclength parameters of null curves , we can also give a construction method of conformal curvature line coordinate systems and conformal asymptotic coordinate systems near non - flat points according to the sign of the gaussian curvature of a timelike minimal surface ( theorem [ theorem : p - weierstrass_real ] ) .",
    "about the behavior of the gaussian curvature near singular points of surfaces in the @xmath0-dimensional euclidean space @xmath2 or an arbitrary 3-dimensional riemannian manifold , some notions of curvatures along singular points of _ frontals _ and _ wave fronts _ ( or _ fronts _ for short , and the definitions of frontals and fronts are given in section [ sec.4 ] ) were introduced in @xcite and many relations between the behaviors of these curvatures and the gaussian curvature along singular points of frontals and fronts were revealed in @xcite . on the other hand , in @xmath1 ,",
    "takahashi @xcite proved that any minface is a frontal and gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a minface to be a front as well as the case of maxfaces ( see also fact [ lemma t-2 ] ) .",
    "based on these backgrounds , in this paper we also discuss relations between the behavior of the gaussian curvature near singular points of minfaces and structures of frontals and fronts . more precisely we prove the following result :    [ maintheorem ] let @xmath9 be a minface and @xmath10 a singular point of @xmath11 .    *",

    "moreover , as corollaries of theorem [ maintheorem ] , we determine the behavior of the gaussian curvature if cuspidal edges accumulate to another non - degenerate singular point ( ( iii ) of corollary [ cor : ce - s - ccr ] ) , and determine when umbilic points and quasi - umbilic points accumulate to a non - degenerate singular point of a minface ( corollary [ cor : accumulate points ] ) .",
