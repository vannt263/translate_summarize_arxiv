    "electronic properties of simple one and quasi - one dimensional model systems have been studied with keen interest over the past few years .",
    "this is mainly due to the success of nanofabrication techniques in producing extremely small quantum objects characterised by discrete energy levels and novel transport properties , which can be examined in a controllable way @xcite-@xcite .",
    "precision instruments such as the scanning tunnel microscope ( stm ) can now be used to build low dimensional nanostructures with tailor made geometries , such as one dimensional wires and confined two dimensional structures @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the tip of an stm can act as tweezers and can practically ` place ' individual atoms on a substrate .",
    "thus , simple low dimensional model quantum systems are now closer to reality .    in recent times , there has been some attention on the study of electronic transport properties of linear atomic chains with side coupled finite segments in the forms of chains or rings @xcite-@xcite . motivated by the ability of an stm to place metal atoms along a line on an insulating substrate , thus creating what one may call an ideal metallic chain , vasseur et al @xcite have theoretically studied the spectral properties of periodic arrays of atomic sites attached to linear chains to simulate the band structure of one dimensional atomic wires of alkali elements .",
    "pouthier and girardet @xcite have reported transport studies on similar systems , but with the side attached chains occupying randomly selected positions along the quantum wire . the resonance and anti - resonance",
    "have been studied in details on the basis of a scaling theory . within the tight binding formalism , a model of a quantum wire with a side coupled",
    "array of non - interacting quantum dots has been persued by orellana et al @xcite and later , by dominguez - adame et al @xcite .",
    "the conductance oscillations with an odd - even parity effect , depending on the number of ` quantum dots ' in the dangling chain have been observed .",
    "interestingly , similar models involving a random distribution of finite sized chains attached to different sites of a lattice ( the backbone ) were studied earlier by guniea and vergs @xcite .",
    "they discussed the localization properties exhibited by such systems .    while the localization , conductance and band structure of an ordered array of atomic sites with one or more finite chains attached to it have exhibited non - trivial behavior , the observation of fano resonance @xcite in the transmission properties of such systems has been another interesting aspect .",
    "the fano lineshape in known to occur in different branches of physics , such as atomic physics @xcite , atomic photoionization @xcite , optical absorption @xcite , raman scattering @xcite , scanning tunneling through a surface impurity atom @xcite .",
    "the manifestation of fano resonance is in the form of a sharp asymmetric profile in transmission or absorption lines , arising out of the interference effect between the discrete energy level ( caused by an impurity ) and the continuum of states .",
    "the general formula describing the fano lineshape is given by , @xmath0 where , @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath2 is the energy of the electron , @xmath3 is the resonance energy and @xmath4 is the line width .",
    "@xmath5 is the so called ` fano factor ' which controls the asymmetry in the line shape .",
    "very recently , it has been reported that similar fano line shapes are observed in simple geometries such as a finite chain of atoms connected to one or more sites in a perfectly ordered array of atomic sites . using the fano - anderson model @xcite , miroshnichenko et al @xcite",
    "have studied the linear and non - linear fano resonance in the transmission across a periodic array of identical sites at one point of which a single defect site is side coupled .",
    "it is shown that the fano resonance is observed as a specific feature in the transmission coefficient as a function of the frequency @xcite .",
    "extending the idea to the case when the attached fano defect is no longer a single atom , but a chain of atoms , miroshnichenko and kivshar @xcite have proposed a possible engineering of fano resonances .",
    "such simple models , as the authors argue , can be used to model discrete networks of coupled defect modes in photonic crystals and complex waveguide arrays and ring - resonator structures .",
    "earlier , guevara et al @xcite and orellana et al @xcite had studied electronic transport through a model of a double quantum dot molecule attached asymmetrically to leads .",
    "the fano and dicke profiles were observed and analysed , and the role of an applied magnetic field was discussed as well @xcite .",
    "the above studies @xcite-@xcite are made within the framework of a tight binding model , the hamiltonian being described in the wannier basis .",
    "the ` interaction ' with the defect state is described by a hopping amplitude @xcite .",
    "thus , in such works the coupling in energy space between the continuum of states and the discrete quasi - bound state , as in fano s original work @xcite , is alternatively viewed , in a real space description , as a ` hopping ' between an atomic site in a perfect infinite lattice and that in a side attached chain , which we shall refer to as a ` fano defect ' .",
    "what really is interesting is that , such a simple real space description allows one to handle the problem analytically , get some insight into how the fano lineshapes are controlled by various parameters of the system .",
    "these model studies thus , as observed by miroshnichenko et al @xcite ` may serve as a guideline for the analysis of more complicated physical models ' .",
    "an important isuue however , has not been addressed so far , to the best of our knowledge .",
    "how does the nature of the distribution of eigenvalues of the isolated fano defect affect the transmission through the quantum wire , when one or more fano defects are coupled to the wire ?",
    "it is known that the zeroes of transmission occur at the discrete eigenvalues of the hanging chain when it is decoupled from the quantum wire @xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "therefore , the spectral character of the isolated fano defect is likely to produce interesting features in the transmission spectrum .",
    "motivated by this idea , in this communication , we investigate the transport across a tight binding chain of periodically placed atomic sites with a quasiperiodic defect chain side coupled to it .",
    "the defect chain in the present work is chosen to be a fibonacci chain @xcite .",
    "in particular , we focus on the situation when the length of the dangling fibonacci chain extends to infinity . in this limit , the fibonacci chain ,",
    "when isolated , will give rise to a singular continuous spectrum with the eigenvalues distributed in a multifractal cantor set @xcite-@xcite . by properly choosing the parameters of the system the entire spectrum of the side coupled fibonacci chain can be made to lie within the allowed band of the periodic lattice ( our ` quantum wire ' , in the spirit of ref.@xcite ) .",
    "this may lead to interesting transmission properties . in what follows",
    "we demonstrate that indeed , very interesting transmission properties are obtained , in which continuous zones of high transmission are punctuated with sharp drops to zero transmission . such feature , for a long enough chain , is observed at various scales of energy , exhibiting a self - similar pattern .",
    "the self similarity becomes pronounced at smaller and smaller intervals of energy as the size of the defect chain is increased .",
    "this might provide us with an option of designing molecular switches which can tune a system from an ` on ' to an ` off ' state over an arbitrarily small range of energy .",
    "we have also investigated transport properties in presence of multiple hanging fibonacci chains separated by an arbitrary number of sites .",
    "in particular , for two such hanging chains we have come across a special feature in transmittivity which may give rise to an idea of designing spin filters with such geometries . in what follows",
    "we describe our systems and the results .    in section",
    "ii we describe the model .",
    "section iii provides the first results in the context of a single side coupled chain . in section",
    "iv we present the band structure and transmission when multiple chains are attached to the wire , and in section v we draw conclusions .",
    "we begin with a reference to fig.1 .",
    "the hanging chain with the shaded circles represent the quasiperiodic fano defect , which we will refer to as a fibonacci - fano ( ff ) defect .",
    "the fibonacci chain is grown recursively by repeated application of the inflation rule @xcite , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , where , @xmath8 and @xmath9 may stand for two ` bonds ' .",
    "the first few generations are , @xmath10 and , so on . at any @xmath11th genetarion ,",
    "the total number of the ` bonds ' is a fibonacci number @xmath12 , where , @xmath13 for @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 .",
    "depending on the nearest neighbour topology , we identify three kinds of sites , viz , @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , flanked by @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22 bonds .",
    "the hamiltonian of the system , in the standard tight binding form , is written as , @xmath23 where , @xmath24 in the above , @xmath25 and @xmath26 represent the creation ( annihilation ) operators for the wire and the defect respectively . @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the on - site potential and the constant hopping integral in the periodic array of sites , which is our ` wire ' .",
    "the on - site potential in the bulk of the defect fibonacci chain takes on three different values , viz @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 corresponding to the three kinds of sites referred to above .",
    "the first ( top ) and the last ( bottom ) sites of the hanging chain are assigned on - site potentials @xmath32 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the nearest neighbor hopping integral takes on two values @xmath34 and @xmath35 for electron hopping along an @xmath8 or an @xmath9 bond . the fibonacci chain is assumed to be connected to the site indexed ` zero ' in the quantum wire . @xmath36 represents the hopping integral between the zeroth site of the wire and the first site of the fibonacci chain .",
    "so , @xmath36 is the ` interaction ' which locally couples the two subsystems , viz , the periodic chain , and the dangling ff defect .",
    "if we decouple the two , the spectrum of the periodic quantum wire is absolutely continuous , the band extending from @xmath37 to @xmath38 .",
    "the dispersion relation is @xmath39 , @xmath40 representing the lattice spacing . with non - zero @xmath36",
    "it is not right to view the two subsystems separately . in this case",
    ", the defect chain may be looked upon as a single impurity with a complicated internal structure and located at a single site in an otherwise periodic array of identical potentials @xmath27 .",
    "therefore , while examining the transmission across the impurity , one has to be careful to adjudge whether the concerned energy really belongs to the spectrum of the entire system , that is , the ordered backbone plus the ff defect .    to calculate electronic transmission across the quantum wire",
    ", we use the real space renormalization group ( rsrg ) method @xcite .",
    "we renormalize the hanging fibonacci chain by decimating the internal sites selectively . for this",
    "we have to ` fold ' the chain backwards by using the growth rule in opposite direction . to get unique recursion relation for the site at the chain",
    "s lower boundary , we consider fibonacci chains with odd index of generation only .",
    "thus , instead of the growth rule , as pointed out before , we fold the chain by using the rule @xmath41 and @xmath42 , which is one step ahead of the usual deflation rule @xmath6 and @xmath7 . this is to be appreciated that , it is not a limitation of the scheme . as our interest is the large size behaviour of the impurity , by considering successive odd generations only of the fibonacci chain we do not lose any physics whatsoever . staring with a @xmath43-th generation fibonacci chain , decimation of @xmath11-steps folds it to a diatomic molecule with two end atoms having on - site potentials @xmath44 and @xmath45 , and connected to each other by an effective hopping integral @xmath46 .",
    "the process is outlined in the appendix . using this method",
    ", we can create a single , _ effective impurity _ with site potential @xmath47 sitting at the @xmath48-th site of the ordered backbone ( quantum wire ) .",
    "the recursion relations are given by , @xmath49 where , @xmath50 here , @xmath51 for @xmath52 , @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "finally , for the single impurity site we get , @xmath53 where , @xmath54 the problem is now reduced to calculating transmission across a single @xmath5-like impurity with an effective potential @xmath47 .",
    "this is easily done @xcite .",
    "the transmission coefficient is given by , @xmath55 where , @xmath56/t_c$ ] .",
    "eq.(8 ) resembles the fano formula ( 1 ) , if we make the asymmetry parameter @xmath5 disppear .",
    "the resonance line width is , @xmath57 with @xmath58 corresponding to the wave vector at resonance . in this case , comparing with the fano expression ( 1 ) , we see that , @xmath59 .",
    "@xmath60 is an energy dependent quantity .",
    "this , as we shall see , may give rise to asymmetric fano profiles for a single hanging fibonacci chain , as compared to a perfectly ordered chain .",
    "we begin by considering a single fibonacci - fano defect . in figs.2b and",
    "2c we present results of the calculation of transmission coefficient across an effectively single defect that has been obtained after @xmath11-times renormalizing the fibonacci chain of @xmath43th generation .",
    "in particular , we discuss the ` transfer model ' of the fibonacci chain with @xmath61 , and @xmath62 .",
    "the energy spectrum of an infinite ( or , semi - infinite ) fibonacci lattice with such specifications exhibits a three sub - band structure , each sub - band splitting up into three other sub - bands as one makes a closer scan in energy @xcite . the result for an ordered chain is presented in fig.2a for comparison .",
    "transmission zeroes are obtained from the roots of the equation @xmath63 at each real root of this equation @xmath64 , and a total reflection occurs . for all real roots the incoming electron faces an infinitely high potential barrier . naturally , among these roots we are concerned about those , which fall in the allowed band of the ordered backbone .",
    "the electron can not be transmitted at these energies , and we get transmission zeroes . it should be appreciated that these roots also yield the discrete eigenvalues of the isolated fibonacci chain . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the eigenvalues of the fibonacci chain are distributed in a cantor set of measure zero @xcite .",
    "therefore , when the length of the side coupled fibonacci - fano defect increases to infinity , we expect a cantor set distribution of transmission zeroes in the @xmath65 vs @xmath2 diagram .",
    "the hierarchical structure of the spectrum is apparent in the transmission profiles , as shown in fig.2c . by tuning the values of the parameters it is possible to include the entire spectrum of the isolated defect chain in the allowed band of the ordered chain playing the role of the quantum wire .",
    "the fragmented character of the spectrum of the defect fibonacci chain then allows one to control the conductance of the wire with the defect , as every subcluster exhibits windows of finite transmission separated from each other by abrupt fano drops to zero .",
    "transmission resonances may be obtained from the solutions of the equation @xmath66 this makes @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the ` impurity ' in this case becomes indistinguishable from a site in the perfectly ordered quantum wire .",
    "for all such energy values the transmission coefficient @xmath69 , independent of the wire - defect coupling @xmath36 .",
    "the solutions of the equation @xmath70 are also distributed in a cantor set structure .",
    "an essential difference in the transmission spectrum offered by a quantum wire with an attached ordered chain @xcite and that with a single attached fibonacci - fano defect is the observation of asymmetric fano profiles . to appreciate the difference we look at the expanded form of the effective impurity potential , viz , @xmath71}{[e-\\epsilon_{t , n}][e-\\epsilon_{b , n } ] -t_{l , n}^2}\\ ] ]",
    "as already noted , perfect transmission occurs at the energy eigenvalues satisfying eq.(12 ) and , the transmission zeroes are obtained from the solution of @xmath72 , or equivalently , @xmath73[e - \\epsilon_{b , n } ] - t_{l , n}^2 = 0\\ ] ] owing to the highly fragmented nature of the spectrum of the isolated fibonacci chain , any energy we hit upon will be arbitrarily close to a gap in the spectrum . as a result , for a big enough fibonacci - fano defect , @xmath46 ( and , @xmath74 as well ) , after @xmath11 steps of renormalization will become vanishingly small .",
    "thus , if we deviate slightly from the resonance energy by setting @xmath75 , with @xmath76 being an arbitrarily small number that we can choose at our will , the left hand side of eq.(12 ) can be made arbitrarily close to zero .",
    "but , at the same time , @xmath46 becomes very very small as well ( for an appreciable size of the defect chain ) , as the chosen energy , in all probability , will lie in a gap .",
    "also , both @xmath44 and @xmath45 are of the same order of magnitude .",
    "thus , the left hand side of eq.(15 ) can be made to have a magnitude at least @xmath77 .",
    "this may make @xmath64 and consequently , @xmath78 in the immediate neighborhood of a transmission resonance .",
    "this leads to the possibility of observing asymmetric profiles in the transmission spectrum with a fibonacci - fano defect chain . for an ordered chain as a defect ,",
    "all the energy values extracted from the equation @xmath79 correspond to extended eigenstates of the chain ( when isolated ) . as a consequence , the hopping integral under successive renormalization never flows to zero for any such energy . in the thermodynamic limit , the spectrum of the isolated chain will be a continuum .",
    "that is , any deviation from the roots of the equation @xmath79 will also be in the spectrum , and would correspond to an extended state .",
    "the hopping integral remains non zero for all such energies as well .",
    "this disapproves the juxtaposition of transmission zero and unit transmission , and hence an asymmetry in resonance profile . in fig .",
    "3 ( bottom panel ) we highlight the concommitant zeroes which give rise to the asymmetry in lineshape in case of a fibonacci - fano defect in its @xmath80th generation ( @xmath81 bonds ) .",
    "the uniformity in spacing of the eigenvalues of an ordered fano defect does not allow for any asymmetry .",
    "this is shown in fig.3 ( top panel ) .",
    "the profile of the transmission window is sensitive to the choice of the wire - defect coupling @xmath36 . for low @xmath36",
    ", we can have reasonably flat windows suddenly dropping down to provide zero transmission at @xmath82 , while , with large enough values of @xmath36 , the entire spectrum practically consists of sharp delta like transmission peaks arranged in a self similar triplet of clusters , typical of a fibonacci lattice .",
    "the behavior is not difficult to understand if one remembers that @xmath36 is proportional to the width of resonance .",
    "before we end this section , it is worth mentioning that a non - zero flow of the hopping integrals , which usually implies the presence of extended eigenstates , may take place in a fibonacci chain as well .",
    "one such energy , leading to a sharp asymmetric fano resonance is shown in fig.4 .",
    "the defect chain is a @xmath83th generation fibonacci lattice in the transfer model .",
    "resonance takes place at @xmath84 in unit of @xmath28 .",
    "the hopping integrals @xmath46 and @xmath74 do not flow to zero at this energy indicating that the corresponding eigenstate is not localized within the size of the defect .",
    "in the spirit of vasseur et al @xcite and pouthier and girardet @xcite we have investigated the effect of attaching muliple fibonacci - fano ( ff ) defects of identical size at regular interval on the ordered backbone . just as in the case of an array of ordered side coupled chains @xcite , the ff defects , when grafted periodically along the backbone open up a series of absolute band gaps in the spectrum . for a fibonacci chain in the @xmath11th generation we have @xmath12 bonds , and",
    "the band structure of an infinite array of grafted ff defects shows @xmath85 bands , where @xmath86 in the number of sites in the ordered backbone which separate two neighboring ff defects .",
    "a simple algebra leads to the most general expression for the transmission coefficient of identical @xmath11 grafted chains separated from each other by @xmath86 atoms in the backbone .",
    "each chain is renormalized into a single defect sitting on the backbone and separated from its nearest defect by @xmath86 ` pure ' sites .",
    "the system is further reduced , for convenience , to an array of identical pseudo - atoms by decimating the intermediate ` pure ' sites .",
    "the new lattice spacing is now @xmath87 and , the effective potential @xmath88 at each site as well as the effective nearest neighbour hopping integral @xmath89 are given by , @xmath90 where , @xmath91 and , @xmath92 is the @xmath93th order chebyshev polynomial of the second kind .",
    "it is now straightforward to compute the transmission coefficient of @xmath11 such defects embedded in a perfect lead .",
    "the result is ,    @xmath94 ^ 2 + \\left [ ru_{n+2}(y)-\\frac{u_{n}(y)}{r}\\right ] ^2 \\sin^2 qa}\\ ] ]    where , @xmath95 , and , @xmath96 . in fig.5",
    "we show transmission spectrum for more that two fibonacci - fano defect chains .",
    "two such cases are presented with @xmath97 and @xmath98 in unit of @xmath28 . in each case",
    "there are ten grafted chains separated by three sites of the backbone .",
    "each grafted chain is a @xmath80th generation fibonacci lattice containing @xmath81 bonds . with @xmath97 ,",
    "the absolute gaps are not formed with only @xmath99 chains .",
    "however , an increase in the value of @xmath36 to unity opens up gaps in the spectrum . with a small number of chains",
    "one may still look for asymmetric fano profiles .",
    "however , quantum interference between the waves reflected back and forth between the grafted defect chains mask such resonances , and it is difficult to locate them numerically .",
    "the self similarity in the distribution of the eigenvalues of each defect , when they are decoupled from the backbone are lost as well .",
    ".3 in    _ inversion of peak - dip positions : two fibonacci - fano defects _    .25 in",
    "we now address separately the problem of transmission through two defect chains spaced @xmath86 sites apart .",
    "it is found that , irrespective of whether the defect chain is quasiperiodic or not , at special values of energy the positions of resonance and the anti - resonance can be _ swapped _ by varying the number of ` pure ' atoms in the backbone separating the hanging defects .",
    "incidentally , a similar phenomenon was also reported in ref.@xcite when an additional impurity atom was placed in the main array .",
    "thus , it is sensible to attribute this feature ( in systems such as we address here ) to the presnece of two defects in an ordered backbone , at least one of which is a fano defect .",
    "the significance of such swapping has already been pointed out elsewhere @xcite .",
    "for example , with a magnetic impurity , the transmission peak of the spin ` up ' ( down ) electrons may coincide with the transmission zero of the spin ` down ' ( up ) electrons .",
    "this opens up the possibility of desiging a spin filter with such systems .",
    "it may be mentioned that , tight binding model of a quntum wire with an attached tight binding ring has already been proposed as a model of a spin filtering device @xcite .    as an example of the above phenomenon , in fig.6",
    ", we demonstrate the swapping of the peak - dip positions for two cases .",
    "fig.6a corresponds to the simpler one , where each of the two defect chains consists of just two atoms coupled to the backbone at two different sites separated by @xmath86 intermediate atomic sites of the backbone .",
    "the zeroes of transmission are at , @xmath100 .",
    "the swapping has been demonstrated around @xmath101 by changing @xmath86 from @xmath102 ( solid line ) to @xmath103 ( dashed line ) . in fig.6b ,",
    "a similar transmission profile is exhibited for a fibonacci - fano defect with @xmath104 bonds . in each case",
    ", the swapping of the peak - dip profile takes place around a transmission - zero , which is obtained by solving the equation @xmath105 . using a fibonacci chain as a fano defect opens up the possibility of getting a fractal distribution of such inversion of the resonance - anti resonance positions .",
    "one can perhaps then think of a spin filter that can operate on arbitrarily narrow scales of energy .",
    "however , detecting such swapping of resonance profiles at various energies remains a non trivial task , as the spectra of the grafted chains , when quasiperiodic in character , offer a highly fragmented band structure .",
    "this aspect needs further attention .",
    "getting an anlytical insight into the phenomenon of swapping is difficult with big fibonacci chains , as the expression for the transmission amplitude turns out to be a formidable one .",
    "however , we explicitly demonstrate that , for the case of the simpler diatomic chains , it is indeed possible to ` see ' the effect as @xmath86 changes .",
    "let us look back at fig.1b with just two atoms in each of the defect chains .",
    "we assign on - site potential @xmath27 to each atom in the two chains , while the inter - atomic hopping in each chain has a value @xmath28 .",
    "the expression for @xmath106 , defined in eq.(8 ) now becomes , @xmath107 with two such chains hanging @xmath86 atoms ( of the backbone ) apart , the problem is reduced to the calculation of electronic transmission through a system of @xmath108 atoms .",
    "the outer ones are the ` impurity ' atoms , each with site energy @xmath47 defined in eq.(7 ) .",
    "the @xmath86 ` inner ' atoms are ` pure ' , and have on - site potential equal to @xmath27 .",
    "the nearest neighbour hopping integral is @xmath28 in this sample .",
    "the sample is then connected to two ideal semi - infinite leads at the two ends , and the transmission amplitude can be worked out in a straightforward way @xcite as , @xmath109 where , @xmath110 , @xmath111 , and @xmath112 are the elements of the transfer matrix @xcite , @xmath113 here , @xmath114 and @xmath115 stand for the transfer matrix across the ` impurities ' and the ` pure ' site respectively",
    ". the explicit form of @xmath116 is ,    @xmath117    where , @xmath118 stands for the @xmath86th order chebyshev polynomial , already defined in eq.(16 ) .",
    "we now look at the behavior of the transmission amplitude in the neighborhood of a transmission zero , which we choose to be @xmath119 .",
    "we set @xmath120 and neglect terms @xmath121 or more ( compared to @xmath122 or terms free from @xmath122 ) in the expanded matrix elements @xmath112 .",
    "the approximate expression of the transmission amplitude , in the neighborhood of the transmission zero becomes ,    @xmath123    the above expression immediately tells us that the ` zero ' of the numerator occurs at @xmath124 ( @xmath125 evaluated at the above energy is not going to be zero ) , while the zero of the real part of the denominator occurs at @xmath126/[2t_0(u_n(x)-u_{n-1}(x)]=\\delta$](say ) .",
    "the locations of the two zeroes are different .",
    "this set of detuned zeroes results in a non - zero fano parameter and an asymmetric resonance around @xmath119 .",
    "the quantity @xmath5 plays the role of the non - zero fano parameter in this case .",
    "a swapping of the peak - dip positions can take place if the fano parameter @xmath5 flips sign with a change in the value of @xmath86 .",
    "we have chekcked that this precisely is the case here , as @xmath86 changes from three to four .",
    "in fact , different pairs of values of @xmath86 can be obtained for which the asymmetry parameter flips sign . as a result , when @xmath127 , the peak appears after the dip , and when @xmath128 , the peak precedes the dip .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , the transition from the pole - zero ( or , equivalently , peak - dip ) to zero - pole positions was also investigated for model quantum systems by several authors @xcite -@xcite .",
    "the change in the asymmetry parameter was shown to be caused by a variation in some _ continuous _ parameter of the system , for example , the strength of the impurity in ref.@xcite , or the magnetic flux in ref.@xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in our case , the asymmetry parameter is a function of the discrete variable @xmath86 , the number of sites between the two dangling chains .",
    "it is the change in the discrete variable @xmath86 that causes the interesting swapping in the peak - dip positions .",
    "we have tested for other cases also , namely , when each of the hanging chains contain three or four atoms . in each case , in a @xmath122- neighborhood of a transmission zero , we find @xmath129 , leading to a @xmath86-dependent fano parameter that flips sign when @xmath86 is made to change suitably .",
    "the case of two fibonacci - fano defects has also been examined numerically , and the result indicates that it is true for this system as well .",
    "thus , we get confidence to predict that , the swapping is a generic feature of two fano defects . whether this remains true when more defect chains are incorporated , needs to be examined carefully .",
    "it may be mentioned that similar fano - like profiles are also found in cases where the distribution of stubs follows a quasiperiodic sequence @xcite-@xcite .",
    "however , the aspect of fano effects in transmission was not addressed in any of these papers .",
    "before we end this section , a comment on the nature of the eigenstates will be in order .",
    "the most important thing to remember is that , to adjudge the character of an electronic state at a particular energy , one has to make sure that the energy concerned corresponds to an ` allowed ' state of the full system , i.e. the sample plus the semi - infinite leads .",
    "this implies that , a consistent solution of the schrdinger equation will exist at that energy all over the sample .",
    "it can be checked , at least for small fano defects such as the case discussed above , by explicitly working out the amplitudes of the wave function at all sites of the system .",
    "it will be found that consistent solution can be obtained for various values of @xmath86 , by assigning _ zero _ amplitude to the sites where the defect chains join the ordered backbone .",
    "the profile of amplitude will resemble a standing wave pattern between the potential barriers ( existing at the defect - backbone junction points ) whose height in given by @xmath60 . at @xmath130 ,",
    "the effective potential @xmath47 becomes infinitely high . as a result , though a non - trivial distribution of amplitudes with finite values can be written throughout the system , the electronic transport reduces to zero .",
    "an electron , released in any one of the intermediate @xmath86 sites and in between the potential barriers , will be reflected back and forth . beyond the well , however",
    ", one can have a perfectly periodic distribution of amplitudes .",
    "thus , it is not right to call such states exponentially localized in the language of conventional localization studies . as the nearest neighbouring sites are still coupled by non - zero hopping integral , it may be tempting to call them extended states .",
    "but , this will also be wrong , as the transmission across the sample for such an energy is zero . in a previous work , in the context of transport through a vicsek fractal ,",
    "such states were encountered , and have been termed ` atypically extended ' @xcite .",
    "we have examined the effect of coupling a quasiperiodic chain of increasing length to an ordered backbone on the electronic transmission .",
    "the self similar spectrum of the side coupled chain leads to an interesting transmission spectrum across the ordered lattice comprising of continuous zones of finite transmission inter - connected by sharp asymmetric fano drops to zero .",
    "this does not disregard the presence of breit wigner type of resonance profiles .",
    "but we have not discussed this . within a framework of real space renormalization group method",
    ", we also discuss the band structure for an infinite array of ff defects .",
    "finally the transmission properties when more than one ff defect chains are attached , are discussed . with two chains",
    "there is a swapping of fano resonance profiles is observed at a specific energy .",
    "this has been explained using a simpler system .",
    "this aspect , as also observed earlier , may be utilised in designing novel spin filters .          .25 in we briefly discuss the way to obtain eq.(5 ) to eq.(8 ) .",
    "real space decimation method ( see @xcite , @xcite , and references therein ) is used .",
    "the basic set of difference equations to be used has the general shape , @xmath131    where , @xmath132 stands for the amplitude of the wave function at the @xmath93th site and @xmath133 represents the nearest neighbour hopping integral between the @xmath93th and the @xmath134th site . as an illustration",
    ", we refer to fig.8 .",
    "@xmath65 stands for ` top ' and @xmath135 stands for ` bottom ' atoms in fig.1 .",
    "a fibonacci chain with eight bonds ( @xmath136th generation ) is attached to a site of the backbone ( marked by the open circle in fig.8a ) .",
    "the set of difference equations for the fibonacci chain are , @xmath137 here , @xmath138 implies the amplitude of wave function at the zeroth site of fig.1 ( which is the open circle here ) where , the defect chain joins the back bone .",
    "the renormalization scheme @xmath41 and @xmath42 implies that we eliminate the amplitudes at sites numbered @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 and @xmath143 in terms of the remaining sites .",
    "this brings the @xmath144-bond ff defect to an effectively @xmath145-bond fibonacci chain with renormalized values of the site energies and the hopping integrals .",
    "such a decimation scheme , when applied to a @xmath43th generation fibonacci chain , leads to the set of equations ( 5 ) . consequently",
    ", the top and the bottom sites , which remain un - decimated , also have renormalized values of the on - site potential .",
    "one further decimation of the two intermediate sites ( the second stage in fig.8a ) brings the entire chain down to a diatomic molecule with renormalized ` top ' and ` bottom ' atoms .",
    "finally , the amplitude at the bottom site is eliminated in terms of the amplitude at the top site to get the expression for @xmath60 .",
    "this is depicted in fig.8b . with bigger ff defect chains",
    "the renormalization process is continued , till the final diatomic molecule ( fig.8a ) is obtained .",
    "thus we get @xmath60 in eq.(8 ) .",
