    "in recent years , two homological invariants for oriented links @xmath0 have been studied extensively : khovanov homology and knot floer homology .",
    "our purpose here is to calculate these invariants for the class of quasi - alternating links introduced in @xcite , which generalize alternating links .",
    "the first link invariant we will consider in this paper is _",
    "khovanov s reduced homology _ ( @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "this invariant takes the form of a bigraded vector space over @xmath1 , denoted @xmath2 , whose euler characteristic is the jones polynomial in the following sense : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the number of components of @xmath5 .",
    "the indices @xmath6 and @xmath7 are called the homological and the jones grading , respectively .",
    "( in our convention @xmath7 is actually half the integral grading @xmath7 from @xcite . )",
    "the indices appear as superscripts because khovanov s theory is conventionally defined to be a cohomology theory .",
    "it is also useful to consider a third grading @xmath8 described by the relation @xmath9    khovanov s original definition gives a theory whose euler characteristic is the jones polynomial multiplied by the factor @xmath10 ; for the reduced theory , the euler characteristic is the usual jones polynomial , i.e. normalized so that it takes the value @xmath11 on the unknot , cf .",
    "note that @xmath12 can be also be defined with integer coefficients , but then it depends on the choice of a component of the link .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath12 is a link invariant over @xmath1 ; see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 3 ) .",
    "the other homological link invariant that we consider in this paper is _ knot floer homology_. this theory was independently introduced by szab and the second author in @xcite , and by rasmussen @xcite . in its simplest form ,",
    "it is a bigraded abelian group @xmath13 whose euler characteristic is ( up to a factor ) the alexander - conway polynomial @xmath14 : @xmath15 knot floer homology was originally defined using pseudo - holomorphic curves , but there are now also several combinatorial formulations available , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the two gradings @xmath6 and @xmath7 are called the _",
    "maslov _ and _ alexander gradings _ respectively ; we also set @xmath16 as above .",
    "knot floer homology detects the genus of a knot @xcite , as well as whether a knot is fibered @xcite .",
    "there exists also an improvement , called link floer homology ( @xcite , @xcite ) , which detects the thurston norm of the link complement , but that theory will not be discussed in this paper . also ,",
    "even though @xmath17 can be defined with integer coefficients , in this paper we will only consider it with coefficients in the field @xmath18    for many classes of links ( including most knots with small crossing number ) , the khovanov and knot floer homologies over @xmath19 or @xmath20 take a particularly simple form : they are free @xmath21-modules supported in only one @xmath22-grading .",
    "we call such links _ khovanov homologically thin ( over @xmath21 ) _ , or _ floer homologically thin ( over @xmath21 ) _ , depending on which theory we refer to . various versions of these definitions appeared in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "further , it turns out that typically the @xmath22-grading in which the homology groups are supported equals @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the signature of the link .",
    "when this is the case , we say that the link is ( khovanov or floer ) _ homologically @xmath24-thin_. ( floer homologically @xmath24-thin knots were called _",
    "perfect _ in @xcite . )",
    "if a link @xmath5 is homologically @xmath24-thin over @xmath19 or @xmath20 for a bigraded theory @xmath25 ( where @xmath25 could denote either @xmath12 or @xmath17 ) , then @xmath26 is completely determined by the signature @xmath24 of @xmath5 and the euler characteristic @xmath27 of @xmath25 ( the latter being either the jones or a multiple of the alexander polynomial ) . indeed , if @xmath28 we must have : @xmath29    in the world of khovanov homology , the fact that the vast majority ( 238 ) of the 250 prime knots with up to 10 crossings are homologically @xmath24-thin was first observed by bar - natan , based on his calculations in @xcite .",
    "lee @xcite showed that alternating links are khovanov homologically @xmath24-thin . since 197 of the prime knots with",
    "up to 10 crossings are alternating , this provides a partial explanation for bar - natan s observation .    at roughly the same time",
    ", a similar story unfolded for knot floer homology .",
    "rasmussen @xcite showed that 2-bridge knots are floer homologically @xmath24-thin ; and this result was generalized in @xcite to all alternating knots .",
    "in this paper we generalize these results to a larger class of links , the _ quasi - alternating links _ of @xcite .",
    "precisely , @xmath30 is the smallest set of links satisfying the following properties :    * the unknot is in @xmath30 ; * if @xmath5 is a link which admits a projection with a crossing such that 1 .",
    "both resolutions @xmath31 and @xmath32 at that crossing ( as in figure  [ fig : skein ] ) are in @xmath33 2 .",
    "@xmath34 + then @xmath5 is in @xmath35    the elements of @xmath30 are called quasi - alternating links .",
    "it it is easy to see ( cf .",
    "* lemma 3.2 ) ) that alternating links are quasi - alternating .    in this paper",
    "we prove the following :    [ khovanov ] quasi - alternating links are khovanov homologically @xmath24-thin ( over @xmath36 ) .",
    "[ floer ] quasi - alternating links are floer homologically @xmath24-thin ( over @xmath1 ) .    for knots with up to nine crossings , theorem  [ khovanov ] and theorem  [ floer ]",
    "provide an almost complete explanation for the prevalence of homological @xmath24-thinness ( over the respective coefficient ring ) .",
    "indeed , among the 85 prime knots with up to nine crossings , only two ( @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) are not khovanov homologically @xmath24-thin , and these are also the only ones which are not floer homologically @xmath24-thin . by the results of @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , 82 of the 83 remaining knots are quasi - alternating .",
    "( among them , 74 are alternating . )",
    "this leaves only the knot @xmath39 , which the authors do not know if it is quasi - alternating .",
    "in general it is difficult to decide whether a larger , homologically @xmath24-thin knot is quasi - alternating .",
    "it remains a challenge to find homologically @xmath24-thin knots that are not quasi - alternating ; @xmath39 could be the first potential example .",
    "a few words are in order about the strategy of proof and the organization of the paper .",
    "both theorem  [ khovanov ] and theorem  [ floer ] are consequences of the unoriented skein exact triangles satisfied by the respective theories . for khovanov homology , this exact triangle ( which relates the homology of @xmath5 to that of its resolutions @xmath31 and @xmath32 , cf .",
    "figure  [ fig : skein ] ) , is immediate from the definition of the homology groups .",
    "the only new ingredient used in the proof of theorem  [ khovanov ] is an observation about relating the gradings to the signature .",
    "we explain this in section  [ sec : khovanov ] of the paper .",
    "in fact , the proof of theorem  [ khovanov ] is an adaptation of the proof of the corresponding fact for alternating links due to lee  @xcite .    for knot",
    "floer homology , an unoriented skein exact triangle was described by the first author in @xcite . in that paper , the maps in the triangle were ungraded . in section  [ sec : floer ] , we show that they actually respect the @xmath22-grading , up to a well - determined shift",
    ". this will imply theorem  [ floer ] .",
    "it is interesting to note that this strategy is quite different from the earlier proofs for two - bridge and alternating links ,  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we remark that theorem  [ floer ] has a number of formal consequences .",
    "the full version of knot floer homology is a graded , filtered chain complex over the polynomial algebra @xmath40.$ ] it was shown in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.4 and the remark immediately after ) that for floer homologically @xmath24-thin knots , their full complex ( up to equivalence ) is determined by their alexander polynomial and signature .",
    "theorem  [ floer ] implies then that this is true for quasi - alternating knots .",
    "furthermore , according to @xcite and @xcite , the full knot floer complex has enough information to determine the heegaard floer homology of any dehn surgery on that knot .",
    "thus , the floer homologies ( over @xmath20 ) of dehn surgeries on quasi - alternating knots are determined by the alexander polynomial , the signature , and the surgery coefficient ; we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for the precise statements .",
    "it is natural to expect theorem  [ floer ] to hold also over @xmath36 .",
    "note that theorem  [ floer ] , combined with the universal coefficients theorem , implies that quasi - alternating links are floer homologically @xmath24-thin over @xmath41 .",
