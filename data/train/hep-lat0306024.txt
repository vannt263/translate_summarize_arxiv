    "i am honored to have this opportunity to talk at this meeting in honor of nicholas metropolis .",
    "his historic work has played a crucial role in many fields , and was absolutely crucial to the development of lattice gauge theory . in this talk",
    "i will reminisce a bit about the early days , trying to explain why a technique from a rather different field became such a crucial tool to the particle theory community .",
    "i will summarize some of the successes and mention a few unsolved problems .",
    "i begin by summarizing the situation in particle physics in the late 60 s , when i was a graduate student .",
    "quantum - electrodynamics had already been immensely successful , but that theory was in some sense `` done . '' while hard calculations remained , and indeed still remain , there was no major conceptual advance remaining .    these were the years when the `` eightfold way '' for describing multiplets of particles had recently gained widespread acceptance .",
    "the idea of `` quarks '' was around , but with considerable caution about assigning them any physical reality ; maybe they were nothing but a useful mathematical construct .",
    "a few insightful theorists were working on the weak interactions , and the basic electroweak unification was beginning to emerge .",
    "the slac experiments were observing substantial inelastic electron - proton scattering at large angles , and this was quickly interpreted as evidence for substructure , with the term `` parton '' coming into play . while occasionally there were speculations relating quarks and partons , people tended to be rather cautious about pushing this too hard .",
    "a crucial feature at the time was that the extension of quantum electrodynamics to a meson - nucleon field theory was failing miserably .",
    "the analog of the electromagnetic coupling had a value about 15 , in comparison with the 1/137 of qed .",
    "this meant that higher order corrections to perturbative processes were substantially larger than the initial calculations .",
    "there was no known small parameter in which to expand .    in frustration over this situation , much of the particle theory community set aside traditional quantum field theoretical methods and explored the possibility that particle interactions might be completely determined by fundamental postulates such as analyticity and unitarity .",
    "this `` s - matrix '' approach raised the deep question of just `` what is elementary . ''",
    "a delta baryon might be regarded as a combination of a proton and a pion , but it would be just as correct to regard the proton as a bound state of a pion with a delta .",
    "all particles are bound together by exchanging themselves .",
    "these `` dual '' views of the basic objects of the theory persist today in string theory .",
    "as we entered the 1970 s , partons were increasingly identified with quarks .",
    "this shift was pushed by two dramatic theoretical accomplishments .",
    "first was the proof of renormalizability for non - abelian gauge theories @xcite , giving confidence that these elegant mathematical structures @xcite might have something to do with reality .",
    "second was the discovery of asymptotic freedom , the fact that interactions in non - abelian theories become weaker at short distances @xcite .",
    "indeed , this was quickly connected with the point - like structures hinted at in the slac experiments .",
    "out of these ideas evolved qcd , the theory of quark confining dynamics .",
    "the viability of this picture depended upon the concept of `` confinement . ''",
    "while there was strong evidence for quark substructure , no free quarks were ever observed .",
    "this was particularly puzzling given the nearly free nature of their apparent interactions inside the nucleon .",
    "this returns us to the question of `` what is elementary ? ''",
    "are the fundamental objects the physical particles we see in the laboratory or are they these postulated quarks and gluons ?    struggling with this paradox led to the now standard flux - tube picture of confinement .",
    "the gluons are analogues of photons except that they carry `` charge '' with respect to each other .",
    "massless charged particles are rather singular objects , leading to a conjectured instability that removes zero mass gluons from the spectrum , but does not violate gauss s law .",
    "a coulombic @xmath0 field is a solution of the equations of a massless field , but , without massless particles , such a spreading of the gluonic flux is not allowed .",
    "the field lines from a quark can not end , nor can they spread in the inverse square law manner . instead , as in fig .",
    "[ fluxtube ] , the flux lines cluster together , forming a tube emanating from the quark and ultimately ending on an anti - quark .",
    "this structure is a real physical object , and grows in length as the quark and anti - quark are pulled apart .",
    "the resulting force is constant at long distance , and is measured via the spectrum of high angular momentum states , organized into the famous `` regge trajectories . '' in physical units , the flux tube pulls with a strength of about 14 tons .",
    "the reason a quark can not be isolated is similar to the reason that a piece of string can not have just one end . of course one",
    "ca nt have a piece of string with three ends either , but this is the reason for the underlying @xmath1 group theory .",
    "the confinement phenomenon can not be seen in perturbation theory ; when the coupling is turned off , the spectrum becomes free quarks and gluons , dramatically different than the pions and protons of the interacting theory .",
    "the mid 70 s marked a particularly exciting time for particle physics , with a series of dramatic events revolutionizing the field .",
    "first was the discovery of the @xmath2 particle @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of this object and its partners as bound states of heavy quarks provided the hydrogen atom of qcd .",
    "the idea of quarks became inescapable ; field theory was reborn .",
    "the @xmath1 non - abelian gauge theory of the strong interactions was combined with the electroweak theory to become the durable `` standard model . ''",
    "this same period also witnessed several remarkable realizations on the more theoretical front .",
    "non - linear effects in classical field theories were shown to have deep consequences for their quantum counterparts .",
    "classical `` lumps '' represented a new way to get particles out of a quantum field theory @xcite .",
    "much of the progress here was in two dimensions , where techniques such as `` bosonization '' showed equivalences between theories of drastically different appearance .",
    "a boson in one approach might appear as a bound state of fermions in another , but in terms of the respective lagrangian approaches , they were equally fundamental .",
    "again , we were faced with the question `` what is elementary ? '' of course",
    "modern string theory is discovering multitudes of `` dualities '' that continue to raise this same question .",
    "these discoveries had deep implications : field theory can have much more structure than seen from the traditional analysis of feynman diagrams .",
    "but this in turn had crucial consequences for practical calculations .",
    "field theory is notorious for divergences requiring regularization .",
    "the bare mass and charge are infinite quantities .",
    "they are not the physical observables , which must be defined in terms of physical processes . to calculate , a `` regulator '' is required to tame the divergences , and when physical quantities are related to each other , any regulator dependence should drop out .",
    "the need for controlling infinities had , of course , been known since the early days of qed . but all regulators in common use were based on feynman diagrams ; the theorist would calculate diagrams until one diverged , and that diagram was then cut off .",
    "numerous schemes were devised for this purpose , ranging from the pauli - villars approach to forest formulae to dimensional regularization . but with the increasing realization that non - perturbative phenomena were crucial , it was becoming clear that we needed a `` non - perturbative ''",
    "regulator , independent of diagrams .",
    "the necessary tool appeared with wilson s lattice theory .",
    "he originally presented this as an example of a model exhibiting confinement .",
    "the strong coupling expansion has a non - zero radius of convergence , allowing a rigorous demonstration of confinement , albeit in an unphysical limit .",
    "the resulting spectrum has exactly the desired properties ; only gauge singlet bound states of quarks and gluons can propagate .",
    "this was not the first time that the basic structure of lattice gauge theory had been written down .",
    "a few years earlier , wegner @xcite presented a @xmath3 lattice gauge model as an example of a system possessing a phase transition but not exhibiting any local order parameter . in his thesis ,",
    "jan smit @xcite described using a lattice regulator to formulate gauge theories outside of perturbation theory .",
    "the time was clearly ripe for the development of such a regulator . very quickly after wilson s suggestion , balian , drouffe , and itzykson @xcite explored an amazingly wide variety of aspects of these models .    to reiterate , the primary role of the lattice is to provide a non - perturbative cutoff .",
    "space is not really meant to be a crystal , the lattice is a mathematical trick .",
    "it provides a minimum wavelength through the lattice spacing @xmath4 , _",
    "i.e. _ a maximum momentum of @xmath5 .",
    "path summations become well defined ordinary integrals . by avoiding the convergence difficulties of perturbation theory",
    ", the lattice provides a route to the rigorous definition of quantum field theory .",
    "the approach , however , had a marvelous side effect . by discreetly making the system discrete , it becomes sufficiently well defined to be placed on a computer .",
    "this was fairly straightforward , and came at the same time that computers were growing rapidly in power .",
    "indeed , numerical simulations and computer capabilities have continued to grow together , making these efforts the mainstay of lattice gauge theory .",
    "now i wish to reiterate one of the most remarkable aspects of the theory of quarks and gluons , the paucity of adjustable parameters .",
    "to begin with , the lattice spacing itself is not an observable .",
    "we are using the lattice to define the theory , and thus for physics we are interested in the continuum limit @xmath6 .",
    "then there is the coupling constant , which is also not a physical parameter due to the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the lattice works directly with a bare coupling , and in the continuum limit this should vanish @xmath7 in the process , the coupling is replaced by an overall scale .",
    "coleman and weinberg @xcite gave this phenomenon the marvelous name `` dimensional transmutation . '' of course",
    "an overall scale is not really something we should expect to calculate from first principles .",
    "its value would depend on the units chosen , be they furlongs or light - fortnights .",
    "next consider the quark masses . indeed , measured in units of the asymptotic freedom scale , these are the only free parameters in the strong interactions .",
    "their origin remains one of the outstanding mysteries of particle physics .",
    "the massless limit gives a rather remarkable theory , one with no undetermined dimensionless parameters .",
    "this limit is not terribly far from reality ; chiral symmetry breaking should give massless pions , and experimentally the pion is considerably lighter than the next non - strange hadron , the rho .",
    "a theory of two massless quarks is a fair approximation to the strong interactions at intermediate energies . in this limit",
    "all dimensionless ratios should be calculable from first principles , including quantities such as the rho to nucleon mass ratio .",
    "the strong coupling at any physical scale is not an input parameter , but should be determined .",
    "such a calculation has gotten lattice gauge theory into the famous particle data group tables @xcite . with appropriate definition",
    "the current lattice result is @xmath8 where the input is details of the charmonium spectrum .",
    "while other techniques exist , large scale numerical simulations currently dominate lattice gauge theory .",
    "they are based on attempts to evaluate the path integral @xmath9 with @xmath10 proportional to the inverse bare coupling squared .",
    "a direct evaluation of such an integral has pitfalls . at first sight ,",
    "the basic size of the calculation is overwhelming . considering a @xmath11 lattice , small by today standards , there are 40,000 links .",
    "for each is an @xmath1 matrix , parametrized by 8 numbers .",
    "thus we have a @xmath12 dimensional integral .",
    "one might try to replace this with a discrete sum over values of the integrand .",
    "if we make the extreme approximation of using only two points per dimension , this gives a sum with @xmath13 terms !",
    "of course , computers are getting pretty fast , but one should remember that the age of universe is only @xmath14 nanoseconds .",
    "these huge numbers suggest a statistical treatment .",
    "indeed , the above integral is formally just a partition function . consider a more familiar statistical system , such as a glass of beer .",
    "there are a huge number of ways of arranging the atoms of carbon , hydrogen , oxygen , etc .  that still leaves us with a glass of beer .",
    "we do nt need to know all those arrangements , we only need a dozen or so `` typical '' glasses to know all the important properties .    this is the basis of the monte carlo approach .",
    "the analogy with a partition function and the role of @xmath15 as a temperature enables the use of standard techniques to obtain `` typical '' equilibrium configurations , where the probability of any given configuration is given by the boltzmann weight @xmath16 for this we use a markov process , making changes in the current configuration @xmath17 biased by the desired weight .    the idea is easily demonstrated with the example of @xmath3 lattice gauge theory @xcite . for this toy model the links are allowed to take only two values , either plus or minus unity .",
    "one sets up a loop over the lattice variables .",
    "when looking at a particular link , calculate the probability for it to have value @xmath18 @xmath19 then pull out a roulette wheel and select either 1 or @xmath20 biased by this weight .",
    "lattice gauge monte - carlo programs are by nature quite simple .",
    "they are basically a set of nested loops surrounding a random change of the fundamental variables .",
    "the results of these simulations have been fantastic , giving first principles calculations of interacting quantum field theory .",
    "i will just mention two examples .",
    "the early result that bolstered the lattice into mainstream particle physics was the convincing demonstration of the confinement phenomenon .",
    "the force between two quark sources indeed remains constant at large distances .",
    "a summary of this result is shown in fig .",
    "[ force ] , taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "another accomplishment for which the lattice excels over all other methods has been the study the deconfinement of quarks and gluons into a plasma at a temperature of about 170190 mev@xcite .",
    "indeed , the lattice is a unique quantitative tool capable of making precise predictions for this temperature .",
    "the method is based on the fact that the euclidean path integral in a finite temporal box directly gives the physical finite temperature partition function , where the size of the box is proportional to the inverse temperature .",
    "this transition represents a loss of confining flux tubes in a background plasma .",
    "[ finitetemp ] shows one calculation of this transition @xcite .",
    "while the gauge sector of the lattice theory is in good shape , from the earliest days fermionic fields have caused annoying difficulties .",
    "actually there are several apparently unrelated fermion problems .",
    "the first is an algorithmic one .",
    "the quark operators are not ordinary numbers , but anti - commuting operators in a grassmann space .",
    "as such the exponentiated action itself is an operator .",
    "this makes comparison with random numbers problematic .    over the years various clever tricks for dealing with this problem",
    "have been developed ; numerous large scale monte carlo simulations do involving dynamical fermions .",
    "the algorithms used are all essentially based on an initial analytic integration of the quarks to give a determinant .",
    "this , however , is the determinant of a rather large matrix , the size being the number of lattice sites times the number of fermion field components , with the latter including spinor , flavor , and color factors . in my opinion ,",
    "the algorithms working directly with these large matrices remain quite awkward .",
    "i often wonder if there is some more direct way to treat fermions without the initial analytic integration .",
    "the algorithmic problem becomes considerably more serious when a chemical potential generating a background baryon density is present . in this case",
    "the required determinant is not positive ; it can not be incorporated as a weight in a monte carlo procedure .",
    "this is particularly frustrating in the light of striking predictions of super - conducting phases at large chemical potential @xcite .",
    "this is perhaps the most serious unsolved problem in lattice gauge theory .",
    "the other fermion problems concern chiral issues .",
    "there are a variety of reasons that such symmetries are important in physics .",
    "first is the light nature of the pion , which is traditionally related to the spontaneous breaking of a chiral symmetry expected to become exact as the quark masses go to zero .",
    "second , the standard model itself is chiral , with the weak bosons coupling to chiral currents .",
    "third , the idea of chiral symmetry is frequently used in the development of unified models as a tool to prevent the generation of large masses and thus avoid fine tuning .    despite its importance , chiral symmetry and the lattice",
    "have never fit particularly well together .",
    "i regard this as evidence that the lattice is trying to tell us something deep .",
    "indeed , the lattice fully regulates the theory , and thus all the famous anomalies must be incorporated explicitly .",
    "it is well known that the standard model is anomalous if either the quarks or leptons are left out , and this feature must appear in any valid formulation .",
    "these issues are currently a topic with lots of activity @xcite .",
    "several schemes for making chiral symmetry more manifest have been developed , with my current favorite being the domain - wall formulation , where our four dimensional world is an interface in an underlying five dimensional theory .",
    "lattice gauge theory has grown into a powerful tool .",
    "indeed , it is becoming essential to the interpretation of experiments at all the high energy and nuclear physics laboratories .",
    "but in many cases the theoretical errors dominate , and we need improved computing resources for further progress . realizing the need to work together on this , the us lattice gauge community has put together a collaborative effort towards the goal of providing terascale computing resources .",
    "currently 66 us lattice theorists are signed on and have set up a 9 member executive committee , chaired by r. sugar of uc santa barbara and including myself as a member .",
    "we are proposing a two pronged approach , with a next generation special purpose machine to be based at brookhaven lab , and two large scale commodity clusters to be based at fermilab and jefferson lab .",
    "the goal is to have in a few years three 10 teraflops scale resources available to the community .",
    "the machine to go at brookhaven is called the qcdoc for `` qcd on a chip . ''",
    "a single node is designed into a single application specific integrated circuit , designed in collaboration between columbia university and ibm .",
    "these will be integrated into a six dimensional mesh .",
    "the riken / bnl research center and the ukqcd collaboration have each ordered 5 teraflops sustained versions of this machine .",
    "the hope is to have in addition a doe sponsored 10 teraflops sustained qcdoc for the us community by the end of 2004 .    in conjunction with this project",
    "is a software effort to make these machines easily accessible to the community .",
    "we want the same software at the top level to run with minimal modifications on all machines , including both the clusters and the qcdoc .",
    "more information on this project can be found at www.lqcd.org .",
    "i conclude by mentioning two problems that particularly interest me .",
    "these are all directly connected with the problems of quarks .",
    "the first is the chiral symmetry problem , alluded to above . here",
    "the recent developments have put parity conserving theories , such as the strong interactions , into quite good shape . the various schemes , including domain - wall fermions , the overlap formula , and variants on the ginsparg - wilson relation , all quite elegantly give the desired chiral properties .",
    "chiral gauge theories themselves , such as the weak interactions , are not yet completely resolved , but the above techniques appear to be tantalizingly close to a well defined lattice regularization .",
    "it is still unclear whether the lattice regularization can simultaneously be fully finite , gauge invariant , and local .",
    "the problems encountered are closely related to similar issues with super - symmetry , another area that does not naturally fit on the lattice .",
    "this also ties in with the explosive activity in string theory and a possible regularization of gravity .",
    "the other area in particular need of advancement lies in dynamical fermion methods . as i said earlier ,",
    "i regard all existing algorithms as frustratingly awkward .",
    "this , plus the fact that the sign problem with a background density remains unsolved , suggests that new ideas are needed . it has long bothered me that we treat fermions and bosons so differently in numerical simulations .",
    "indeed , why do we have to treat them separately ?",
