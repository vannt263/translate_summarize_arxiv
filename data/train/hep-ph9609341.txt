    "in the last few years numerous theoretical and experimental studies have focused on the electron spectrum in semileptonic inclusive @xmath8 decays .",
    "the electron spectrum from free quark decays receives both perturbative and nonperturbative corrections .",
    "knowledge of the shape of the spectrum can provide insights into nonperturbative effects in @xmath9 meson decays , and thereby also give some information on the weak mixing angle @xmath7 . in the framework of heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) it is possible to show that the quark level decay rate is the first term in a power series expansion in the small parameter @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "for infinitely heavy quarks the free quark model is an exact description of heavy meson physics . at finite quark",
    "masses the first few terms in the heavy quark expansion have to be taken into account .",
    "expressions for these nonperturbative corrections to the lepton spectrum are known to order @xmath11 @xcite and the @xmath12 perturbative corrections to the free quark decay were given in @xcite .",
    "the dominant remaining uncertainties are the two - loop corrections to the quark level decay rate and the perturbative corrections to the coefficients of the hqet matrix elements in the operator product expansion . here",
    "we examine the former . while a full two - loop calculation of the electron spectrum is a rather daunting task , it is possible to calculate the piece of the two - loop correction that is proportional to @xmath13 with relative ease by performing the one - loop qcd corrections with a massive gluon .",
    "the @xmath0 parts of the two - loop correction may then be obtained from a dispersion integral over the gluon mass@xcite .",
    "if there are no gluons in the tree level graph , the @xmath0 part of the two - loop contribution is believed to dominate the full @xmath14 result because @xmath15 is rather large .",
    "several examples supporting this belief are listed in @xcite .",
    "a recent calculation @xcite of the @xmath16 correction to the total inclusive rate for @xmath17 decays showed that the @xmath0 parts of the two - loop correction are approximately half as big as the one - loop contribution , resulting in a rather low blm scale @xcite of @xmath18 .",
    "for the electron spectrum we find that this part of the second order correction also amounts to about 50% of the order @xmath19 contribution , at all electron energies except those close to the endpoint .",
    "close to the endpoint the corrections are roughly equal in magnitude .",
    "the hqet matrix elements @xmath20 and @xmath21 can be extracted from the electron spectrum in @xmath17 decays @xcite . even though this method of obtaining hqet matrix elements was found to be rather insensitive to the first order perturbative corrections ,",
    "it is useful to extract @xmath22 including the @xmath0 corrections .",
    "then these matrix elements can be used to relate the pole quark mass to the @xmath4 masses at order @xmath0 .",
    "similarly , one can include the @xmath0 parts of the two - loop contribution in the theoretical prediction for the total rate , which is needed for the determination of @xmath7 .",
    "since the @xmath0 corrections are rather large the resulting changes in the quark masses and @xmath7 are not negligible .    in sect .",
    "ii and iii we give analytic expressions for the contributions from virtual and real gluon radiation .",
    "the last phase space integral in the virtual correction and the last two integrals in the bremsstrahlung are done numerically .",
    "readers not interested in calculational details are advised to skip these sections . in sect .",
    "iv we combine the results from the previous two sections to obtain the @xmath0 corrections to the electron spectrum , and discuss the implications for the extraction of @xmath23 , the @xmath4 quark masses , and @xmath7 . in appendix [ ap2 ]",
    "we give an interpolating polynomial which reproduces the two - loop correction calculated here .",
    "the corrections from massive virtual gluons can be calculated in complete analogy to the usual one - loop qcd corrections .",
    "the ultraviolet divergence in the vertex correction cancels when combined with the quark wave function renormalizations .",
    "there is no infrared divergence since we do the calculation with a massive gluon .",
    "the virtual one - loop correction to the differential rate can be written as @xmath24   \\label{v1loop}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the rescaled gluon mass , and @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 are the rescaled electron energy , charm mass , and momentum transfer , respectively .",
