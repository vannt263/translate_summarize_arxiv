    "anisotropic flow is a response of the system created in a heavy - ion collision to the anisotropies in the initial geometry .",
    "thus , anisotropic flow is very sensitive to the properties of the system at an early time of its evolution .",
    "the sizable azimuthal momentum - space anisotropy observed at rhic energies ( for a review , see  @xcite ) is the main evidence for the nearly perfect liquid behavior  @xcite of the created matter .",
    "quantitatively , anisotropic flow is characterized by coefficients in the fourier expansion of the azimuthal dependence of the invariant yield of particles relative to the reaction plane  @xcite : @xmath0 here @xmath1 is the energy of particle , @xmath2 is the transverse momentum , @xmath3 is its azimuthal angle , @xmath4 is the rapidity , and @xmath5 the reaction plane angle ( see fig  [ geometry ] ) . the first coefficient , @xmath6 , is usually called _ directed flow _ , and the second coefficient , @xmath7 , is called _ elliptic flow_. in general the @xmath8}$ ]",
    "coefficients are @xmath2 and @xmath4 dependent  in this context we refer to them as _",
    "differential flow_. the _ integrated _ flow is defined as a weighted average with the invariant distribution used as a weight : @xmath9        since the reaction plane @xmath5 is not known experimentally , the anisotropic flow is estimated using azimuthal correlations between the observed particles .",
    "for example , using 2-particle azimuthal correlations : @xmath10 where the first term , @xmath11 , is the part due to anisotropic flow , and @xmath12 represents the so called non - flow contribution , that comes from correlations not related to the initial system geometry .",
    "if non - flow is small , eq .  ( [ twoparticleflowestimate ] ) can be used to measure @xmath13 , but in general the non - flow contribution is not negligible . to suppress non - flow",
    "one can exploit the collective nature of anisotropic flow using multi - particle correlations .",
    "the method based on multi - particle cumulants ( _ genuine _ multi - particle correlations ) to measure anisotropic flow was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "this method allows to subtract non - flow effects from flow measurements order by order .",
    "note that some experimental artifacts , such as track splitting , in the analysis also contribute to the two particle correlation ; in this respect multi - particle techniques are also valuable , as they suppress such contributions as well .",
    "one of the problems in using multi - particle correlations is the computing power needed to go over all possible particle multiplets , which practically prohibits calculations of correlations of order larger than @xmath14 ( three - particle correlations ) . to avoid this problem ,",
    "it was suggested in  @xcite to express cumulants in terms of moments of the magnitude of the corresponding flow vector @xmath15 , defined as : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the number of particles .",
    "unfortunately , flow estimates from cumulants constructed in such a way were systematically biased by the interference between various harmonics .",
    "an improved cumulant method using the formalism of generating functions suggested in  @xcite fixed the problem of interfering harmonics while keeping the number of operations still linear with multiplicity @xmath17 . for this approach",
    "the analytical calculations become rather tedious and therefore the solutions are obtained using interpolation formulae .",
    "unfortunately this introduces numerical uncertainties and requires tuning of interpolating parameters for different values of the flow harmonics @xmath13 and multiplicity .",
    "more recently a lee - yang - zero s sum method  @xcite has been developed to suppress non - flow contribution to all orders .",
    "closely related to that are methods of fourier and bessel transforms of the @xmath18-distributions  @xcite , and the method of direct fitting of the @xmath18-distribution .",
    "all these methods , while indeed being almost insensitive to non - flow , are biased by interference of different harmonics .    in this paper",
    "we present a new method to calculate multi - particle cumulants in terms of moments of ( in general , different harmonics ) @xmath18-vectors . in our approach",
    "the cumulants are not biased by interference between various harmonics , interpolating formulas used in the formalism of generating functions are not needed , and , moreover , all detector effects can be disentangled from the flow estimates in a single pass over the data at the level of or better than any other method .",
    "the number of operations required in our approach is still @xmath19 for each @xmath20 . since in our approach cumulants",
    "are calculated without any approximation and directly from the data we often call them _ direct cumulants _",
    "( also referred to as _",
    "@xmath18-cumulants _ because they are expressed analytically in terms of different harmonic @xmath18-vectors ) .",
    "flow fluctuations are an important part of an anisotropic flow study .",
    "it is believed that flow fluctuations are mostly determined by initial geometry fluctuations  @xcite of the system created in a collision .",
    "an important consequence of this is that the anisotropic flow develops relative to the so - called participant plane(s ) instead of the reaction plane determined by the direction of the impact parameter  @xcite .",
    "we note that the method to calculate cumulants proposed in this paper is not influenced by how exactly the anisotropic flow is being developed .    in our simulations",
    "we show results obtained up to the 8-th order cumulant , although we think that in practice there is little advantage to go higher than order six , because going to higher order does not remove the systematic uncertainty related to contribution from clusters exhibiting flow ( see the discussion of systematic uncertainties associated with cumulant analysis in  @xcite ) .",
    "for example , in a 4-particle correlation analysis this bias corresponds to the situation when two particles are correlated because they are coming from the same cluster and , in addition , correlated with another two particles via flow .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "after the main definitions are introduced in section  [ sec : defs ] , we describe how the so - called _ reference flow _ can be calculated .",
    "the reference flow is an average flow in some momentum window ; it is needed for the calculation of the differential flow of particles of interest . to optimize the procedure",
    ", the reference flow can be calculated using weights , e.g. weighted with transverse momentum of the particle .",
    "thus the reference flow can be noticeably different from integrated flow of the same particles .",
    "section  [ sec : diffflow ] describes how the differential flow is calculated . to show how the method works in different environments and how it compares to some other methods we show simulation results in section  [ sec : simu ] .",
    "finally , we summarize the main features of the method . technical details , including the derivation of the main equations , equations in case of using non - unity weights in the calculation of reference flow , and acceptance effects are provided in appendices .",
    "in this paper we discuss mostly 2- and 4-particle azimuthal correlations ( formulae for 6-particle correlation are provided in the appendix ) , but the generalization to azimuthal correlations involving more particles is straightforward .",
    "the method can be easily applied for calculations of _ mixed harmonics _ multi - particle correlations . in fact , mixed harmonics correlations are needed in our approach for calculations of any multi - particle correlations with order higher than 2 .",
    "presenting 4-particle correlations below , we also show how the 3-particle correlations , involving one particle of a double harmonic can be calculated .",
    "all the correlations are obtained by first averaging over all particles in a given event and then averaging over all events .",
    "the latter may involve weights depending on event multiplicity .",
    "we define _ single - event _ average 2- and 4-particle azimuthal correlations in the following way : @xmath21 where @xmath22 , and the prime in the sum @xmath23 means that all indices in the sum must be taken different .",
    "the second step involves averaging over all events : @xmath24 where by double brackets we denote an average , first over all particles and then over all events . @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the event weights , which are used to minimize the effect of multiplicity variations in the event sample on the estimates of 2- and 4-particle correlations . in general , the optimal choice of weights would be determined by the multiplicity dependence of @xmath13 .",
    "the best approach might be to calculate the cumulants at fixed @xmath17 and then average over the entire event sample . in our calculations , with @xmath13 independent of multiplicity , we use : @xmath27 the above choice for the event weights takes into account the number of different 2- and 4-particle combinations in an event with multiplicity @xmath17 .",
    "the general formalism of cumulants was introduced into flow analysis by ollitrault _",
    "we will use below the notations from those papers .",
    "the @xmath28 order cumulant , @xmath29 , is simply an average of 2-particle correlation defined in eq .",

    "to obtain the @xmath38 order cumulant it suffices to separate diagonal and off - diagonal terms in @xmath39 : @xmath40 which can be trivially solved to obtain @xmath41 : @xmath42 the event averaging is being performed via eq .",

    "( [ 4p : result ] ) , such terms do appear in the analytic results and are crucial in disentangling the interference between harmonics .",

    "this is done by using different weights ( e.g. particle transverse momentum ) in the definition of flow vectors used in reference flow calculations .",
    "we provide all the equations necessary for calculations with weights in appendix  [ apw ] .",
    "the equations so far are applicable for an analysis with a detector with full uniform azimuthal coverage . in a non - ideal case",
    "one needs to take into account the acceptance corrections  @xcite .",
    "acceptance affects the cumulants in three ways : ( i ) contributions from additional terms , e.g. proportional to @xmath61 or @xmath62 , that for a detector with full uniform azimuthal coverage are identical to zero , ( ii ) contributions from other flow harmonics , and ( iii ) the cumulant might be rescaled , which at the end can affect the final extracted flow values .",

    "<S> to improve anisotropic flow measurements advanced methods based on multi - particle correlations ( cumulants ) have been developed to suppress non - flow contribution . </S>",
    "<S> these multi - particle correlations can be calculated by looping over all possible multiplets , however this quickly becomes prohibitively cpu intensive . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the most used technique for cumulant calculations is based on generating functions . </S>",
    "<S> this method involves approximations , and has its own biases , which complicates the interpretation of the results . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we present a new exact method for direct calculations of multi - particle cumulants using moments of the flow vectors . </S>"
