    "<S> the present study deals with dissipative future universe without big rip in context of eckart formalism . </S>",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that , if the cosmic dark energy behaves like a fluid with equation of state @xmath1 ; @xmath2 , as well as chaplygin gas simultaneously then the big rip problem does not arises and the scale factor is found to be regular for all time .     </S>",
    "<S> +   +   +    pacs : 98.80cq , 98.80 jk + keywords : dissipative effect ; phantom fluid ; big rip ; accelerated universe +    recent observations like cmb anisotropy , supernova and galaxy clustering strongly indicate that our universe is spatially flat and there exists an exotic cosmic fluid called dark energy with negative pressure , which constitutes about 70 percent of the total energy of universe . the dark energy is usually described by an equation of state ( eos ) parameter @xmath3 , the ratio of spatially homogeneous dark - energy pressure p to its energy density @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> a value @xmath5 is required for cosmic acceleration . </S>",
    "<S> the simplest explanation for dark energy is cosmological constant , for which @xmath6 . the increasing evidence from observational data indicates that @xmath7 lies in a narrow strip around @xmath6 quite likely being less than this value @xcite@xmath8@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the region where eos parameter @xmath9 , is typically referred to as a phantom dark energy universe . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the region with @xmath9 opens up a number of fundamental questions . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the entropy of such universe is negative . the dominant energy condition ( dec ) for phantom fluid </S>",
    "<S> is violated , as a rule . </S>",
    "<S> the phantom dominated universe end up with a finite time future singularity called big rip or cosmic doomsday @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the last property attracted much attention and brought the number of speculations upto the explicit calculation of the rest of the life - time of our universe . </S>",
    "<S> +    soon after caldwell @xcite proposed phantom dark energy model with cosmic doomsday of future universe , cosmologists started making efforts to avoid this problem using @xmath9 @xcite@xmath8@xcite . in the braneworld scenario , sahni and shtanov </S>",
    "<S> has obtained well - behaved expansion for the future universe without big rip problem with @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> they have shown that acceleration is a transient phenomenon in the current universe and the future universe will re - enter matter dominated decelerated phase @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that general relativity ( gr ) based phantom model encounters `` sudden future singularity '' leading a divergent scale factor , energy density and pressure at finite time @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus the classical approach to phantom model exhibits big rip problem . for future singularity model , </S>",
    "<S> curvature invariant becomes very strong and energy density is very high near @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> so , quantum effects should be dominated for @xmath11 one unit of time ( early universe ) @xcite@xmath8@xcite and it is shown that the an escape from the big rip is possible on making quantum corrections to the energy density and pressure in friedmann equations . </S>",
    "<S> +    in the framework of robertson - walker cosmology , chaplygin gas ( cg ) is also considered as a good source of dark energy for having negative pressure , given as @xmath12 where p and @xmath4 are , respectively , pressure and energy density in a co moving reference frame , with @xmath13 ; a is a positive constant . </S>",

    "<S> is modified as @xmath14 where @xmath15 . + for @xmath16 , equation ( [ eq2 ] ) corresponds to equation ( [ eq1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> +    other approaches have considered dissipative effects in cg models , using the framework of elkhart theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thai et al @xcite , have investigated a viscous gcg , assuming that there is a bulk viscosity in a linear borotropic fluid and gcg . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the equation of state of gcg can cross the boundary @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> also in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , it is found that a dissipative chaplygin gas can give rise to structurally stable evaluational scenarios . </S>",

    "<S> + on using equation ( [ eq9 ] ) in equation ( [ eq8 ] ) , we obtain @xmath28 to solve equation ( [ eq10 ] ) , we use the transformation @xmath29 , accordingly equation ( [ eq10 ] ) leads to @xmath30^\\frac{3(1+\\alpha)}{\\alpha(1 - 3\\xi_{0})}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 and @xmath32 ; @xmath33 is the present time . </S>",
    "<S> + in the present model , it is assumed that the dark energy behaves like gcg , obeying equation ( [ eq2 ] ) as well as fluid with equation of state @xmath34 with @xmath9 simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> + from equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( 12 ) , we obtain @xmath35 so , evolution of equation ( [ eq13 ] ) at @xmath36 leads to @xmath37 with @xmath38 . </S>",

    "<S> similar result are obtained by hoyle and narlikar in c -field with negative kinetic energy for steady state theory of universe @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> therefore the present model is free from finite time future singularity . </S>",
    "<S> + now the horizon distance is obtained as @xmath66 @xmath67}\\ ] ] * fig . 1 * depicts the variation of scale factor @xmath68 and horizon distance @xmath60 versus cosmic time , as a representative case with appropriate choice of constants and other physical parameters . </S>",
    "<S> from equation ( [ eq24 ] ) and ( [ eq25 ] ) it is clear that @xmath69 i. e. horizon grows more rapidly than scale factor which is clearly shown in * fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1*. + in this case , the hubble distance is given by @xmath70\\ ] ] equation ( [ eq26 ] ) is showing the growth of hubble distance @xmath71 with time such that @xmath72 as @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour of @xmath74 is clearly depicted in * fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2*. thus in present case , the galaxies will not disappear when @xmath73 , avoiding big rip singularity . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , one can conclude that if phantom fluid behaves like gcg and fluid with @xmath1 simultaneously then the future accelerated expansion of universe will free from catastropic situation like big rip . </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ eq15 ] ) may be written as @xmath75^\\frac{\\alpha}{1+\\alpha}\\ ] ] from equation ( [ eq27 ] ) , it is clear that as @xmath64 , @xmath76 ( since @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus one can conclude that energy density increases with time , contrary to other phantom models having future singularity at @xmath10 @xcite . based on ia supernova data , singh et al @xcite </S>",
    "<S> have estimated @xmath77 for model in the range @xmath78 up to @xmath79 percent confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> taking this estimate as an example , with @xmath16 , @xmath80 is found in the range @xmath81 and with @xmath82 , @xmath80 is found in the range @xmath83 and so on . this does not yields much increase in energy density as @xmath73 but if the future experiments supports large value of @xmath84 then @xmath80 will be high . + it is interesting to see here that present model is derived by bulk viscosity in the context of eckart formalism @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we see that big rip problem does not arises in the present model . in refs @xcite@xmath8@xcite , for models with future singularity escape from big rip , is demonstrated using quantum corrections in the field equations near @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> however the present study deals phantom cosmology with accelerated expansion without catastrophic situations using classical approach . </S>",
    "<S> it is also seen that the model of future universe presented by srivastava @xcite is a particular case of the model presented in this letter . </S>"
