    "moreover , the guiding center changes upon each reflection at the wall ( see fig.6 in ref .  ) .",
    "in contrast , our approach tells that the guiding center remains the same throughout the motion .",
    "we think that this is physically plausible because the guiding center is a constant of motion .",

    "note the different vertical scale with respect to fig .",

    "[ fig : focusing - main ] ]    figure .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main](a ) shows the transmission @xmath231 a function of the magnetic field @xmath0 .",
    "we used parameter values that approximately correspond to the measurements of ref .",
    "on insb quantum wells : electron density @xmath232 , effective mass @xmath233 and rashba coefficient @xmath234 .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that the effective giromagnetic factor @xmath235 of insb is quite large and therefore the zeeman spin splitting can be noticeable already at relatively weak magnetic fields .",
    "therefore in our numerical calculation we took into account the zeeman term as well and assumed @xmath236 .",
    "the distance @xmath6 was @xmath237 and both contacts were tuned to accommodate one ( spin - degenerate ) open channel .",
    "we find that for these parameters the first focusing peak is split [ see the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main](a ) ] .",
    "that for strong enough @xmath32 the first peak is split was first noticed in ref .  .",
    "the peak splitting in good approximation corresponds to @xmath238 .",
    "comparing now the numerical result on the first focusing peak to our analytical prediction , we see that the dip between the peaks is at the magnetic field value where the analytics predicts that destructive interference may take place for @xmath239 ( corresponding to @xmath240 ) but that the presence of the twin peaks at @xmath241 and @xmath242 is not explained by our approach .",
    "it appears that the most straightforward way to understand them is to assume spin - split cyclotron orbits , as in refs .  .",
    "looking at the second focusing peak , one observes that it is located at @xmath219 ( which happens for @xmath243 ) quite accurately , in accordance with our edge - state based theory .",
    "the fact that its amplitude is significantly larger than the amplitude of the first peaks seems to corroborate the theoretical prediction that in this case edge states belonging to different quantization branches [ eq .  ( [ eq : semi - quant - cond-1 ] ) and eq .  ( [ eq : semi - quant - cond-2 ] ) ] can constructively interfere with each other . whether this enhancement of the amplitude could be observed in an actual experimental situation , however , depends on how specular the reflection at the confinement potential is .",
    "( note that in the classical picture the second focusing peak correspond to trajectories which bounce off the boundary between the injector and collector once , see the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - geometry ] . )",
    "a small amount of diffuse scattering at the boundary may render the observation of this enhancement difficult .",
    "finally , we find that close to @xmath244 ( @xmath245 ) , where our calculations predict that the wave functions of the edge states may cancel , the amplitude of the transmission is indeed small , but the focusing peak at a slightly higher magnetic field is again not captured by our calculations .",
    "it seems that peaks which appear when @xmath6 is odd multiple of @xmath206 can not be described with the presented theoretical approach .",
    "the splitting of the third peak close to @xmath246 , reminiscent of the splitting of the first one , is due to the zeeman interaction and not to the soi . as we mentioned , because of the large @xmath235 the zeeman energy can be important at smaller magnetic fields than in e.g. gaas .",
    "this is illustrated in the left inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main](a ) where we show the calculation for the third peak but without taking into account the zeeman term in the hamiltonian .",
    "one can see that for the assumed strength of @xmath247 the third peak is not split in this case .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main](b ) and ( c ) we show the partial transmissions assuming spin polarized injection / detection .",
    "thus , e.g. @xmath230 refers to the transmission probability of electrons being injected in spin @xmath248 eigenstate and collected in @xmath249 .",
    "in contrast to ref .",
    "we chose as spin quantization axis the @xmath250 direction ( for the definition of the coordinates , see fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - geometry ] ) .",
    "the motivation to choose this axis comes from ref .   where it was shown that the average spin of the edge states ( at least the low energy ones ) pointed mainly in the direction perpendicular to the confinement potential , i.e. along the @xmath251 axis in our case .",
    "comparing fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main](b ) and ( c ) one can observe that except for the first focusing peak , the spin - flip transmissions @xmath230 , @xmath229 are always significantly smaller than @xmath252 , @xmath228 .",
    "we also performed calculations ( not shown here ) where the injected electrons were polarized in the @xmath253 direction , as in ref .  , and we found that @xmath230 , @xmath229 were , apart from the vicinity of the first peak , usually smaller in the case of @xmath250 polarized injection than for @xmath253 polarized one .",
    "further investigation of the average polarization of the spin of the edge states in the semiclassical limit and its effect on the partial transmissions in a focusing setup is left to a future work .",
    "in summary , we studied the role of edge states in transverse electron focusing setup for strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "as a first step , employing a semiclassical approach we derived a good approximation for the dispersion relation of the edge states and briefly compared our results to other approximation methods that can be found in the literature .",
    "we then studied the interference of the edge states as this is expected to have ramifications on the focusing spectrum .",
    "comparison of our theoretical results with numerical transport calculations suggests that certain properties of the focusing spectrum can be quite well understood in terms of the interference of the edge states .",
    "nevertheless , the presented semiclassical approach can not capture all the important characteristics of the transport calculations .",
    "finally , we studied numerically the electron focusing when spin polarized injection was used .",
    "the tight binding parameters we used in the numerical computations shwon in fig .",
    "[ fig : focusing - main ] were as follows : in terms of the lattice constant @xmath254 , the scattering region was @xmath255 wide , the distance between the injector and collector was @xmath256 , the width of the probes was @xmath257 and the rashba coupling constant was @xmath258 , where the hopping @xmath259 was set to unity ."
