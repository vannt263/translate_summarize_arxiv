    "i , blue - shifted lines dominated the spectrum and the red - shifted lines were all relatively weak by comparison , so most work focused on modeling the blue jet .",
    "the jet velocity was determined very accurately due to the small scatter of individual line doppler shifts and the narrowness of their profiles , indicating that all line - emitting gas flows at the same speed .",

    "the goal of the observation was to determine which parts of the jets would be occulted due to this eclipse .",
    "the results of the optical observations presented by @xcite , along with the length of the jets determined assuming an adiabatic cooling model , are utilized to measure the size and mass of the companion .",

    "our conclusions rely on the postulate that adiabatic cooling dominates over radiative losses , and we will discuss the limitations of this model in @xmath195.1 .",
    "previous x - ray observations of the ss 433 system during eclipse @xcite also displayed weak emission lines from the receding jet . this result has led some to believe the entire inner region of the jets was eclipsed . however , our spectrum during occultation shows numerous emission lines from the receding jet .",
    "particularly , the presence of strong , highly - ionized fe lines indicates only the low - energy portion of this jet was eclipsed .",

    "based on the precession ephemeris by @xcite as updated by @xcite , the angle of the jet to the line of sight during this observation was predicted to be @xmath20=80.0 . from the precession and binary ephemeris by @xcite , the binary phase range was 0.96 to 0.98 . for observation 1020",
    ", @xmath20 was 96.0  ( meaning that the normally appoaching western jet was temporarily pointed farther from the line of sight than than the normally receding eastern jet ) and the binary phase range was 0.68 - 0.70 .      the zeroth - order image from the three observations ( the paper i observation and the two presented in this paper ) is shown in figure 1 and is distinctly elongated in the east - west direction .",
    "the extended x - ray emission was first reported in paper i. this result is consistent with @xcite who found evidence for outflowing hot plasma in the extended x - ray emission .",
    "the scale of emission is 10@xmath21 larger than the region producing the bulk of the x - ray spectrum , indicating plasma is reheating very far from the compact object .",
    "the excess emission in the east - west direction is associated with the arcsecond - scale radio jet , as observed by @xcite using the vla .",
    "based on the dispersed spectra ( because the point source is somewhat piled up , as in paper i ) , the x - ray flux from ss 433 was constant during observation 1019 but increased by about 15% on a time scale of 10000 s in november 2000 .",

    "unlike paper i where some red jet lines were undetectably weak , every blue jet line has a corresponding red jet line in the march 2001 observation .    for each line ,",
    "the i d was determined based on the expected shifts of the blue and red jets from the kinematic model and the measured redshift . for the precession phase of our observation ,",
    "the predicted blue- and red - shifts were 0.011 and 0.063 , respectively , using the equation and parameters in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "wavelengths of line blends were obtained using wavelengths from the astrophysical plasma emission database ( aped ) weighted by the relative fluxes of each component based on the models from @xmath195 . the s xv and si",
    "xiii triplets were analyzed as in paper i. precise redshifts for these profiles were determined by fitting these blends with several variable width gaussian components and with fixed rest wavelength values given by aped , as implemented in interactive spectral interpretation system ( isis ) . unlike in paper",
    "i , the red and blue jet lines were prominent enough to facilitate accurate measurement of the redshift for both jets .",
    "two lines were not assigned to either the red or blue jets : a neutral fe - k line and a si i - k line , both at rest in the observed frame .",
    "table  [ tab : linefluxes ] shows that the doppler shifts of the lines in the blue jet system are consistent with a single velocity to within the uncertainties , as are those in the red jet system .",
    "the few deviations are mostly due to blended lines ( e.g. , line triplets ) in each jet and are not likely indicative of intrinsic variations .",
    "furthermore , all deviations are substantially smaller than the observed line widths , which are on the order of @xmath22z = 0.006 . the doppler shift of the blue jet was determined to be @xmath23 during this observation ( as opposed to the @xmath24 in paper i ) .",
    "for the red jet , the unblended lines give @xmath25 ( compared to the @xmath26 reported in paper i ) .",
    "as in paper i , we assume the system is comprised of two perfectly opposed jets at an angle @xmath20 to the line of sight .",
    "then , the doppler shifts of the blue and red jets are given by    @xmath27    where v@xmath28 is the velocity of the jet flow , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 .",

    "this value is slightly smaller than the @xmath14 obtained in the first paper , @xmath35 , and is closer to , but still larger than , the jet velocity determined by @xcite based on the h-@xmath20 lines . substituting the value for @xmath14 back into eq .",

    "the line widths in table  [ tab : linewidths ] are consistent with the weighted average value ( @xmath36 ) of @xmath37 km s@xmath17 .",
    "we note that @xmath36 is @xmath92 times the value in paper i : the observed lines are twice as broad as those reported in paper i. marginal evidence exists indicating a trend that the lower energy lines are slightly narrower than average .",
    "as found in paper i , the widths of the red jet lines are consistent with those of the blue jet .",
    "the line widths are too large to result from thermal broadening for @xmath38 kev ( see @xmath194 )  100 - 200 km s@xmath17 .",
    "the doppler broadened widths may result from the divergence of a conical outflow @xcite or from doppler shift variations during the observation .",
    "we will investigate the relationship between broadening and doppler shift variations in a subsequent paper on a recent hetgs observation of ss 433 ( marshall et al .",
    "the origin of the line broadening does not affect the line flux measurements and the plasma modeling of the next section .",
    "to model the x - ray spectra , we use a plasma diagnostic approach where emission lines correspond to specific jet temperatures . in both the red and blue jets ,",
    "we observe comparable line strengths in fe , ca , and ar .",
    "longward of 4 the red jet lines become weaker than the blue jet lines .",
    "we assume that this effect arises from occultation of the low - energy part of the red jet by the companion star .",
    "although si and s are present in the red jet , these lines are not as strong as expected given the blue jet line fluxes .",
    "therefore , we model the red jet with comparatively lower emission measures at longer wavelengths .    as in paper",
    "i , the spectra were modeled using isis and the aped atomic database of line emissivities and ionization balance .",
    "the emission measure distribution was estimated by fitting the line flux data to a multitemperature emission model assuming approximately solar abundances .",
    "starting from the model used to analyze the first observation , a moderately good fit was obtained to the line fluxes with a four - component model for both jets , as given in table 3 .",
    "we assumed that the ism absorption was the same as determined in : @xmath39 @xmath40 .",

    "the abundances of fe , s , si , mg , and ne in the models for both jets were increased by 70% relative to h and he in order to reduce the model continuum to match the observed continuum . in paper",
    "i , the abundances were increased 30% over the solar values .",
    "the continuum fits well over much of the spectrum , but in the 812   region , the model predicts a continuum that is systematically low by up to a factor of 2 . adding a fifth , low temperature component , however , predicted emission lines that are not observed .    for the red jet ,",
    "the same four - temperature model was used as the blue jet .",
    "the two low - temperature components were set to zero to model the low - energy portion of the red jet as blocked by the companion due to eclipse .",
    "the resulting two - temperature model is given in table 3 .",
    "this method produced reasonable agreement with the data except around the red jet si xiii line .",
    "given the broader emission lines in the march 2001 observation , the lack of doppler boosting , and the slightly shorter exposure time compared to the paper i observation , the analysis of the si xiii triplet did not produce stringent limits on the jet electron density . in the blue jet , the value of the ratio of the forbidden and intercombination lines , @xmath41 , is consistent with the value determined in paper i. however , it is also consistent with the asymptotic value as @xmath42 drops below @xmath43 @xmath44 for a plasma with @xmath45 k ( where si xiii is formed ) .",
    "we note that the blue jet si xiii triplet was better resolved in the paper i observation , and the paper i measured @xmath46 value corresponded to @xmath42 @xmath9 @xmath47 @xmath44 .",
    "this electron density is consistent with the assumption that flow time is much greater than the recombination timescale .",
    "the si i fluorescence line is confused somewhat with the si xiii of the red jet , making it difficult to compare its @xmath46 or @xmath48 values with those of the blue jet .",
    "the spectrum is more complex than the model suggests : additional lines may be present at 8.1   and 10.1   that are not included in the model , and the line at 5.1   ( s xv in the blue jet ) appears to be slightly stronger in the model than in the data .",
    "the si xiii red jet line and the fe xxiii / xxiv blue jet line are much stronger than the model s prediction .",
    "we note that fe xxiii / xxiv is not detected from the red jet due to eclipse , and the blue jet fe xxiii / xxiv discrepancy may arise from deviation from ionization equilibrium at low temperatures in both jets .",
    "almost all the other line fluxes are matched to within 50% , and the strongest lines are modeled to within 10%-20% .",
    "we consider the overall fit to be reasonably satisfactory .",
    "it is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum1 ] that the highly ionized fe lines are not occulted during the eclipse , whereas lower ionization states of si are not as strong in the receding jet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum2 ] ) as in the approaching jet .",
    "thus , we interpret this result as indicating the cooler part of the red jet is blocked by the companion , whereas the hotter portions ( where the fe lines are produced ) are unocculted .",
    "we assume the jet flow is conical and has a constant opening angle and jet velocity ( as in fig .",
    "9 of paper i ) because ions in different temperature ranges have similar line widths and doppler shifts .",
    "consequently , the electron density @xmath49 is proportion to @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the distance from the apex of the cone .",
    "approximate values for the plasma parameters were determined iteratively in about fifty runs of the isis four - zone model .",
    "once we found a satisfactory model for the blue jet ( see table 3 ) , the next step was to distinguish the physical differences in the red jet . to calculate the range of acceptable emission measures for the red jet in the four - zone model , we varied the emission measures in zone 2 and zone 3 , while the zone 1 emission measure was set to zero and the zone 4 emission measure was set equal to the value of the blue jet .",
    "initially , the second- and third - component emission measures were set to zero , as displayed in fig .",

    "other conditions ( besides eclipse ) might cause the dimming observed in the cool portion of the red jet . for example , an electron scattering region could exist that linearly increases in optical depth with distance from the disk .",
    "optical depth @xmath69 is related to jet length through the scattering region @xmath70 by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the thomson scattering cross - section and @xmath42 is the electron density . at the far side of the red jet , @xmath73 , where @xmath51 is the jet length @xmath74 cm and @xmath75  from @xmath193 .",

    "this density is implausibly high , and we discount the possibility of either electron scattering by an ionizing gas or absorption by a cold , neutral gas .",

    "2004 obtained different values for the mass ratio @xmath95 ( and consequently semimajor axis @xmath94 ) than the one used above .",
    "based on weak absorption features in the optical spectra , they predict the companion is an evolved a - star with a mass @xmath910.9 @xmath53.1 @xmath1 and the compact object is a black hole with mass @xmath112 .",
    "this classification of the donor star is difficult because of the bright accretion disk that swamps signatures of the companion .",
    "our model requires accretion to occur through a wind process , so the companion can not be an a supergiant by our analysis .",
    "future high - resolution optical and x - ray spectral observations of ss 433 are necessary to distinguish the true nature of the donor star .    to check the robustness in our determination of the companion s radius , we calculate @xmath46 for different values of @xmath95 .",

    "7.615.5 @xmath114 produces companion mass values between 2580 @xmath1 , and the resulting compact object mass is 660 @xmath1 .",
    "this work generates numerous questions we will address in upcoming papers .",
    "foremost , our results rely on the assumptions that the adiabatic model adequately fits the observed spectra and that the jets have identical velocities and directions . as discussed in @xmath19[sec : models ] and @xmath19[subsec : adiabatic ] , the adiabatic model has shortcomings , and we plan to reexamine the jet cooling using recent 200 ks hetgs observation of ss 433 ( obsids 5512 , 5513 , 5514 , 6360 ) .",
    "additionally , the observed line broadening may arise from the divergence of conical outflow or from doppler shift variations through the course of an observation ( see @xmath193 ) .",
    "we plan to constrain the origins of this broadening in our next paper as well .",
    "further optical measurements are needed in order to determine @xmath106 and @xmath105 more definitively .",
    "these velocities are vital to firmly establish the nature of ss 433 .",
    "we are currently completing simultaneous observations of ss 433 in the x - ray , optical , and radio bands in order to examine the jets and their changes as they move outward from the disk in a more comprehensive manner .",
