    "<S> in this contribution we study the photoproduction of quarkonium in coherent proton - proton and nucleus - nucleus interactions at the lhc . the integrated cross sections and rapidity distributions </S>",
    "<S> are estimated using the color glass condensate ( cgc ) formalism , which takes into account the parton saturation effects at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear shadowing effects are also taken into account .    in this contribution we study the photoproduction of vector mesons in the coherent @xmath0 interactions at the lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> the main advantage of using colliding hadrons and nuclear beams for studying photon induced interactions is the high equivalent photon energies and luminosities that can be achieved at existing and future accelerators ( for a review see ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , studies of @xmath1 interactions at lhc could provide valuable information on the qcd dynamics at high energies . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea in coherent hadron collisions is that the total cross section for a given process can be factorized in terms of the equivalent flux of photons of the hadron projectile and the photon - photon or photon - target production cross section . in exclusive processes , </S>",
    "<S> a certain particle is produced while the target remains in the ground state ( or is only internally excited ) . </S>",
    "<S> the typical examples of these processes are the exclusive vector meson production , described by the process @xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> ( @xmath3 ) . in the last years </S>",
    "<S> we have discussed this process in detail considering @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath5 @xcite and @xmath6 @xcite collisions as an alternative to investigate the qcd dynamics at high energies . here , we revised these results and present for the first time our predictions for the @xmath7 production . </S>",
    "<S> the cross section for the photoproduction of a vector meson @xmath8 in an ultra - peripheral hadron - hadron collision is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the photon energy and @xmath11 is the equivalent flux of photons from a charged hadron . </S>",
    "<S> the total cross section for vector meson photoproduction is calculated considering the color dipole approach , which is directly related with the dipole - target forward amplitude @xmath12 . in the color glass condensate ( cgc ) </S>",
    "<S> formalism ( see e.g. @xcite ) , @xmath12 encodes all the information about the hadronic scattering , and thus about the non - linear and quantum effects in the hadron wave function . in our analyzes </S>",
    "<S> we have used the phenomenological saturation model proposed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> nuclear effects are also properly taken into account .    </S>",
    "<S> our predictions for the rapidity distributions are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and for the total cross section in table [ tab1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the main uncertainties are the photon flux , the quark mass and the size of nuclear effects for the photonuclear case . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , specific predictions for @xmath13 and @xmath14 phoproduction in @xmath5 collisions can be found in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the rates are very high , mostly for light mesons . </S>",
    "<S> although the rates are lower than hadroproduction , the coherent photoproduction signal would be clearly separated by applying a transverse momentum cut @xmath15 and two rapidity gaps in the final state .
