    "<S> we calculate nuclear enhanced power corrections to structure functions measured in deeply inelastic lepton - nucleus scattering in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . </S>",

    "<S> the ratio of longitudinal cross sections @xmath6 measured by hermes collaboration was as large as @xmath7 for scattering off a @xmath8n target . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , due to nuclear shadowing in the small @xmath9 region , the ratio of the transverse cross section @xmath10 is much less than 1 , which leads to a very large nuclear enhancement in a double ratio @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> the key difference between hermes data and other data is the range of @xmath12 and @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath5 is small , the @xmath12 of hermes data is much smaller than that of other data sets . </S>",
    "<S> it is then natural to investigate the role of @xmath32 type power corrections to the ratio of the dis cross sections , @xmath33 .    </S>",
    "<S> when energy exchange of the collision , @xmath34 , is much larger than the typical momentum scale of the hadron wave function , the dis process is dominated by a single hard collision between the lepton and a quark via the virtual photon , as shown in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> [ fig1](c ) is a part of the hard collision . </S>",
    "<S> because of the extra interactions with the scattered quark , physical contributions from such multiparton scattering are suppressed by inverse powers of @xmath12 , known as the high twist contributions @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> clearly , figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) and [ fig3](b ) reproduce all the key features of the hermes data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 1 and 2 of ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the detailed numerical comparison with the hermes data requires better knowledge of original data analysis and reliable low @xmath12 parton distributions , and will be presented elsewhere .    in the rest of the letter </S>",
    "<S> , we explain why the nuclear enhanced power corrections are consistent with the hermes data . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) or fig .  1 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the ratio @xmath93 or @xmath3 shows a steep falling feature when @xmath5 decreases , which is not observed in other experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the steep falling was mainly caused by strong @xmath5 dependence of the @xmath18 and a large @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> substituting @xmath108 into eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ epsilon ] ) , we find that @xmath18 falls steeply from 0.9 to 0.25 when @xmath5 decreases from 0.03 to 0.0125 at @xmath104  gev@xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the ratio @xmath109 falls along with the @xmath18 .    the @xmath12 dependence , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](b ) or in fig .  2 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is the most counterintuitive . </S>",
    "<S> normally , when @xmath12 increases , we expect the effect of power corrections to go away , or the ratio @xmath93 to approach one . </S>",
    "<S> however , the hermes data shows an opposite behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such a counterintuitive behavior in hermes data was caused by the strong @xmath12 dependence of the @xmath18 parameter . </S>",
    "<S> for example , when @xmath12 changes from 0.5  gev@xmath26 to 0.9  gev@xmath26 , the @xmath18 at @xmath110 decreases from 0.78 to 0.13 by dropping a factor of 6 , while the size of power corrections changes for less than a factor of 2 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the decrease of the double ratio @xmath93 when @xmath12 increases is due to the steep falling of the combination @xmath111 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rr ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the @xmath18 dependence of the hermes data , shown in fig .  3 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is a direct consequence of explicit @xmath18 dependence in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ ratio - sigma ] ) or eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ rr ] ) . from our numerical estimate </S>",
    "<S> , we also find that the observed large double ratio @xmath112 for @xmath113 , as shown in fig .  5 of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , is due to a strongly nuclear enhanced @xmath114 at @xmath104  gev@xmath26 and a relatively small @xmath115 , which is consistent with other measurements @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that strong nuclear effects in @xmath3 and @xmath4 , observed by hermes collaboration , are direct consequences of strong nuclear enhanced power corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that our numerical estimate reproduces all the features of the hermes data . </S>",
    "<S> when the @xmath12 is as small as 0.6  gev@xmath26 , we find that the structure function @xmath39 is still dominated by the leading twist contributions , while the longitudinal structure function @xmath116 is dominated by the nuclear enhanced power corrections . </S>",
    "<S> since the leading power corrections are large , it is therefore important to study the nuclear enhanced power corrections at even higher powers of @xmath32 to have a better qcd prediction . </S>"
