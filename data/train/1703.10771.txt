    "the cooperative output regulation problem aims to design a control law for a multi - agent system to drive the tracking error of each follower to the origin asymptotically while rejecting a class of external disturbances .",
    "the problem is interesting because its formulation includes the leader - following consensus , synchronization or formation as special cases . like the output regulation problem of a single linear system @xcite , there are two approaches to handling the cooperative output regulation problem of multi - agent systems .",
    "the first one is called feedforward design @xcite .",
    "this approach makes use of the solution of the regulator equations and a distributed observer to design an appropriate feedforward term to exactly cancel the steady - state tracking error .",
    "the second one is called distributed internal model design @xcite .",
    "this approach employs a distributed internal model to convert the cooperative output regulation problem of an uncertain multi - agent system to a simultaneous eigenvalue assignment problem of a multiple augmented system composed of the given multi - agent system and the distributed internal model .",
    "the internal model approach has at least two advantages over the feedforward design approach in that it can tolerate perturbations of the plant parameters , and it does not need to solve the regulator equations .    recently , the study on the cooperative output regulation problem has been extended to linear multi - agent systems with time - delay and/or communication delay .",
    "specifically , the cooperative output regulation problem for linear continuous - time multi - agent systems with time - delay was studied in @xcite via the distributed observer approach and in @xcite via the distributed internal model approach .",
    "the cooperative output regulation problem for linear discrete - time multi - agent systems with time - delay was studied in @xcite via the discrete distributed observer approach .",
    "since the discrete distributed observer approach can not handle the model uncertainties and the control law has to rely on the solution to the discrete regulator equations , we will further develop a distributed internal model approach to deal with the cooperative output regulation problem for discrete - time multi - agent systems with both input and communication delays .    to solve our problem",
    ", we will first introduce a distributed internal model for linear discrete - time time - delay multi - agent systems .",
    "this distributed internal model together with the given multi - agent system defines a so - called auxiliary augmented system .",
    "we will show that , if the communication network of the multi - agent system is connected , then our original problem can be converted to the stabilization problem of the auxiliary augmented system . due to this result",
    ", it suffices to stabilize the auxiliary augmented system via either static state feedback control law or dynamic output feedback control law .",
    "it is noted that the stabilization problem of the auxiliary augmented system is challenging for two reasons .",
    "first , the auxiliary augmented system is also a time - delay system , and , second , it is also subject to communication constraints . we have managed to overcome these challenges by both distributed static state feedback control law and distributed dynamic output feedback control law .",
    "technically , our approach is related to the references @xcite and @xcite . the reference @xcite deals with the robust output regulation problem for continuous - time linear multi - agent systems with both communication and input delays .",
    "our current work can be viewed as a discrete - time analog of the framework in @xcite . since ,",
    "for time - delay systems , the regulator equations for continuous - time systems and discrete - time systems are somehow different and the stabilization techniques for continuous - time systems and discrete - time systems are also different , an independent study on the discrete - time multi - agent delay systems is necessary . on the other hand , the reference @xcite studies the robust output regulation problem for a single linear system with both communication and input delays .",
    "the current paper can be viewed as an extension of the results of @xcite to multi - agent systems .",
    "compared with @xcite , the main technical challenge is to find a distributed control law to satisfy the communication constraints .",
    "it is also noted that the cooperative robust output regulation problem for delay - free uncertain discrete - time multi - agent systems was also considered by distributed state feedback control in @xcite .",
    "however , for delay - free systems , the regulator equations for continuous - time systems and discrete - time systems are the same , and the stabilization techniques for the auxiliary augmented system of the continuous - time systems and discrete - time systems are also the same .",
    "the techniques used in @xcite for continuous - time multi - agent systems is directly applicable to the discrete - time multi - agent systems .",
    "it is also worth mentioning some other references relevant to the topic of this paper can be found in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
