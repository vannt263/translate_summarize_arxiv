    "recent advances in @xmath0-ray instrumentation have led to the discovery of gev and tev emission from a handful of high - mass x - ray binaries .",
    "most of these binaries appear to be either wind accreting or colliding wind binaries in which a compact object ( a neutron star or a black hole ) is orbiting an early - b or late - o type massive companion .",
    "however , for most of these high - mass @xmath0-ray binaries ( hmgbs ) the energy release mechanism and the type of compact object are unknown .",
    "it is possible that systems with a young pulsar orbiting a massive star may dominate the population of hmgbs . in these hmgbs most of the high energy emission",
    "is believed to be produced at the shock located between the pulsar wind and the massive - star wind .",
    "although the spatially - integrated multiwavelength spectra and variability have been the subject of multiple studies , they only provide indirect diagnostics of the complex wind interaction .",
    "theoretical models suggest that the shocked flow can be accelerated to relativistic velocities , forming a spiral which might then be disrupted by instabilities .",
    "these predictions are yet to be verified observationally because it is challenging to achieve the high angular resolution required to directly resolve the structure of the interacting winds in these systems .",
    "some recent intriguing evidence of extended emission comes from vlbi observations which indicate variable , subarcsecond - scale structures in a few known hmgbs @xcite .",
    "the only hmgb in which the compact source has been detected as a radio pulsar @xcite is b125963/ls2883 ( hereafter b1259 ) .",
    "the radio pulsations are seen during a large fraction of the 3.4 yr orbital period , but they disappear for about four weeks @xcite when the pulsar is moving through the dense wind of its massive companion around periastron .",
    "it is possible that other hmgbs , whose orbits are more compact , also host young pulsars which can not be seen in the radio because the radio emission is blocked by the dense stellar wind . studying the high - energy emission from b1259 allows one to probe the properties of both the massive - star and pulsar winds and study the mechanisms of their interaction . in particular",
    ", the pulsar wind properties can be studied in a regime inaccessible in observations of isolated pulsars . in this paper",
    "we report the discovery of variable extended x - ray emission around b1259 and discuss the implications for colliding wind models of such binaries for the theory of pulsar winds and for the nature of high - energy emission in hmgbs .",
    "the radio pulsar psr b125963 has the following properties : period @xmath3ms , characteristic age @xmath4kyr , spin - down power @xmath5ergs@xmath6 , magnetic field @xmath7 g , and distance @xmath8kpc @xcite .",
    "the orbit of the b1259 binary is highly eccentric ( @xmath9 ) , with semimajor axis @xmath10au , period @xmath11d , and inclination @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "the massive companion , a fast - rotating late o - type star with a luminosity @xmath13 @xcite , has an equatorial excretion disk and is a source of a strong stellar wind .",
    "the disk is thought to be inclined to the orbital plane at an angle of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "x - ray and radio data suggest that the pulsar passes through the disk during time intervals of @xmath15 days before periastron and @xmath16 days after periastron @xcite .",
    "it has been known from multiple observations that the x - ray flux and spectrum of b1259 vary with the orbital phase @xcite , but no x - ray pulsations with the pulsar s period have been detected @xcite .",
    "this and the relatively high x - ray luminosity of b1259 , compared to isolated pulsars with similar parameters , suggest that the observed x - ray emission is mainly caused by the collision of the pulsar wind with the massive companion wind , which produces a shock whose properties are modulated with the orbital period in this highly eccentric binary .",
    "although most of the x - ray emission is likely generated within the binary and in its immediate vicinity , the shocked matter blown out from the binary can be visible at larger distances in high - resolution observations .",
    "extended radio emission of 1050 mas ( @xmath17120 au ) size has been detected near periastron of b1259 and interpreted as synchrotron radiation of shocked pulsar wind ejected from the binary @xcite .",
    "such a size is too small to be resolved in x - ray observations , which can , however , probe the blown - out matter at larger distances .",
    "the only previous high - resolution x - ray image of b125963 was obtained in a 28 ks _",
    "chandra _ x - ray observatory ( _ cxo _ ) observation carried out on 2009 may 14 , when the pulsar was very close to apastron .",
    "very faint , amorphous , asymmetric extended emission ( up to @xmath1 south - southwest from the pulsar position ) was detected at a @xmath18 confidence level @xcite .",
    "this emission was tentatively interpreted as a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) confined by a shock between the two winds and ultimately blown out from the binary by the wind of the massive companion . here",
    "we report the results of two deeper observations .",
    "we observed b1259 with the advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) on board on 2009 may 14 , 2011 december 17 , and 2013 may 19 ( see table 1 for obsids and mjd dates ) .",
    "as the first observation was already analyzed and the results were published @xcite , we only refer to it as needed to supplement our analysis and discussion of the results of the last two observations .",
    "details of the binary phases and exposure times are listed in table 1 .",
    "the target was imaged on the front - illuminated acis - i3 chip , in timed exposure mode .",
    "we used ` very faint ' ( vfaint ) telemetry format to reduce the detector background and optimize the sensitivity for the faint extended emission .",
    "a 1/8 subarray was used to reduce the frame time to 0.4s and mitigate the effect of pile - up .",
    "the highest count rate ( see table 1 ) corresponds to the pile - up fraction of @xmath19% and hence can be neglected .    for our analysis",
    "we downloaded the pipeline - produced level 2 event files , which have been cleaned of various artifacts .",
    "no episodes of anomalously high background rates occurred in the observations .",
    "no randomization was applied to the event positions in the level 2 event files we used . to further improve the accuracy of the event positioning , the energy - dependent subpixel event repositioning ( edser ) procedure was applied during the pipeline processing .",

    "as we know from observations of pwne of isolated pulsars , the pulsar wind is predominantly concentrated around the pulsar s equatorial plane .",
    "if this plane coincides with the orbital plane , and the high - mass companion wind is nearly isotropic , the location of the contact discontinuity , separating the shocked winds on the line connecting the two stars ( the stagnation point ) is at the distance @xmath60 from the pulsar , where @xmath61 is the separation between the binary companions , @xmath62 is the ratio of the momentum fluxes of the pulsar wind and stellar wind at the half - distance between the pulsar and the star , @xmath63 is the mass - loss rate of the high - mass companion , @xmath64 is terminal wind velocity , and @xmath65 is the half - opening angle around the equatorial plane into which the pulsar s wind is blowing ( @xmath66 for an isotropic wind ) . at @xmath67",

    "the pl spectrum of the resolved extended emission could be interpreted as synchrotron emission of the shocked pulsar wind , while the thermal plasma emission could be produced by the massive companion wind heated to x - ray temperatures by the interaction with the energetic pulsar wind ( e.g. , in oblique shocks and instabilities ; ) and ejected from the system .",

    "this mass is much larger than @xmath76 g lost by the high - mass companion wind during the whole orbital period .",
    "therefore , we conclude that thermal emission from the heated o - star ejecta alone can not explain the observed extended x - ray emission",
    ".    the other possible interpretation could be synchrotron emission from pulsar wind particles .",
    "using standard formulae for synchtrotron radiation ( e.g. , ) , we can estimate the lorentz factors of the emitting electrons as @xmath77 .",

    "the lower limit on magnetic field can be obtained by requiring the electron larmor radius to be smaller than the transverse size ( @xmath101 ) of the arc - like extended emission seen in the 2013 image , @xmath102  @xmath96 g ( which implies @xmath103 ) .",
    "the corresponding magnetic and electron energies are @xmath104 erg and @xmath105 erg , respectively , in the volume @xmath106 @xmath56 .",
    "the total energy , @xmath107 , in the emitting volume is much smaller than the energy lost by the pulsar spin - down during one orbital period , @xmath108 , in a broad range of magnetization parameter , @xmath109 , which means that the cloud energy can be supplied by the pulsar in a fraction of the binary period . in the following subsections we describe two scenarios that could explain the origin of the extended synchrotron - emitting structure .",
    "the first scenario assumes that we observed the same cloud in december 2011 and may 2013 , which had been moving with the average velocity @xmath110 since the launch .",
    "however , if such a cloud is created and ejected from the binary in the course of interaction of the pulsar wind with the dense excretion disk close to the nearest preceding periastron ( i.e. , about one year before the first observation ) , it should decelerate very rapidly .",
    "the drag force exerted on the light , fast - moving cloud by the ambient medium is very large : @xmath111 , where @xmath112 cm@xmath33 is the frontal area of the cloud , and @xmath113 is the ambient density .",
    "the deceleration caused by this force can be estimated as @xmath114 cm s@xmath115 , where @xmath116 erg is the total ( particle and magnetic field ) energy in the emitting volume .",
    "the characteristic deceleration time is then @xmath117 s. this means that if the circumbinary medium is filled with the stellar wind of the high - mass companion , the cloud of relativistic electrons would be decelerated and/or destroyed in a time much shorter than the interval of 519 days between our two observations .",
    "the deceleration time could be larger if the cloud is loaded with a substantial amount of the o - star wind .",
    "for instance , it will exceed the apparent travel time from the binary , @xmath118 d , if @xmath119 g , which still requires a rather low ambient density , @xmath120 @xmath54 , to be consistent with the mass and energy budget .",
    "therefore , this scenario seems rather unlikely",
    ". the drag force could be much smaller if the matter ahead of the cloud is mostly comprised of the pulsar wind particles and is moving away from the binary with a high velocity .",
    "the presence of such a lepton - dominated medium would be more plausible on the apastron side of the orbit where the pulsar spends most of the time .",
    "overall , the moving cloud scenario seems to require somewhat artificial assumptions , but it can not be firmly ruled out without further investigation ( e.g. , another _ cxo _ observation could confirm or rule out the translational motion of the cloud ) .      in the second scenario , which we consider more plausible , the extended structures are formed at the _ extrabinary termination shock _ in the pulsar wind at large distances from the binary , comparable to those observed in pwne around isolated pulsars @xcite , so that the different locations of the structures in december 2011 and may 2013 are due to different conditions at the epochs of their formation , rather than to the motion of a cloud of relativistic electrons from the binary .",
    "formation of such a distant termination shock can be understood as follows . in a high mass binary",
    "the pulsar s wind collides with the companion s wind and forms a double - shock structure within the binary and in its vicinity @xcite .",
    "if the pulsar wind is dynamically dominant , it escapes freely in the directions away from the high - mass companion and , similar to an isolated pulsar wind , shocks in the ambient medium at a distance @xmath121 , where the wind s ram pressure becomes comparable to the ambient pressure , @xmath122 .",
    "synchrotron radiation from the shocked pulsar wind can be observed as an extrabinary pwn . as the pulsar orbits the heavy companion , this extrabinary shock rotates around the binary , seeding the medium with x - ray emitting relativistic electrons ( positrons ) .",
    "if their cooling time is larger than the orbital period , one can expect a uniformly bright extended structure to form around a circular binary at distances @xmath123 ; such a structure would be brighter on the apastron side for an eccentric binary because the pulsar spends more time around apastron than around periastron .",
    "the location of the structure can vary due to variations in the ambient pressure or because of instabilities that can destroy the contact discontinuity , separating the two winds , and mix the stellar wind matter into the pulsar wind .",
    "the extended x - ray structures detected near the b1259 binary could be associated with such an extrabinary termination shock formed at a distance @xmath124 cm , where @xmath125 dyn @xmath31 .",
    "the corresponding angular separation from the binary , @xmath126 ( where @xmath127 is the angle between the line of sight and the line connecting the binary and the emitting region ) is close to the observed separations of the detected extended structures at @xmath128 .",
    "such high pressures are possible in wind - blown bubbles around massive stars @xcite .",
    "the magnetic field immediately beyond the shock can be estimated as @xmath129 @xmath96 g for @xmath130 , where @xmath131 is the pre - shock magnetization parameter @xcite .",
    "this field is consistent with @xmath132 @xmath96 g , inferred assuming a synchrotron origin of the detected emission .",
    "the synchrotron cooling time in such a field , @xmath133 yr , exceeds the orbital period , which means that the pwn structure created in a given orbital cycle could be seen in a few following cycles , and its azimuthal extent around the binary can be rather large .",
    "the latter conclusion does not contradict to the small azimuthal extent ( @xmath134 ) of the observed structures because the pwn brightness is proportional to the amount of pulsar wind particles supplied in a given direction .",
    "this amount strongly varies throughout the eccentric orbit , with a maximum around apastron .",
    "it should be noted that a major restructuring of both the extrabinary and intrabinary pwn components is expected when the pulsar moves through the dense excretion disk of the o star around periastron .",
    "however , since the pulsar spends only a small fraction ( @xmath135 ) of the orbital period in this stage but sweeps a large range ( @xmath136 ) of true anomalies ( see figure [ orb ] ) , we do not expect a significant contribution of this stage to the extrabianry pwn .",
    "the observed shift of the extended structure during 1.5 years can be reconciled with the large @xmath137 if the apparent motion is interpreted as a shift of the termination shock caused by a 30% change of the ratio of the pulsar - wind pressure to the ambient pressure .",
    "the extended emission was the faintest during the 2009 observation , which occurred near apastron at the true anomaly intermediate between those of the 2011 and 2013 observations .",
    "therefore , the extended emission flux is not a periodic function of true anomaly , even for adjacent orbital cycles , which could be explained either by variations in the density / velocity of the o - star wind or by instabilities developing at the interface between the winds .",
    "these arguments may also explain a factor of three different x - ray fluxes from the entire binary ( at nearly the same true anomalies ) seen in the earlier observations with other satellites ( see figure 2 from @xcite ) . in this interpretation we neglected the role of possible mixing of the stellar wind into the pulsar wind , which could lead to mass loading and deceleration of the pulsar wind at large distances from the binary",
    "the unexpected morphology and transient behavior of the resolved extended emission have not been captured in the existing models of such systems .",
    "most likely , the observed structures can be interpreted as the synchrotron emission from the pulsar wind shocked by the interaction with the circumbinary medium or with the heavy stellar wind entrained into the pulsar wind outflow .",
    "the appearance of the pwn and the parameter estimates suggest that in either case most of the observed extended emission comes from the pulsar wind ejected from the binary near apastron .",
    "if our interpretation of the discovered x - ray emission is correct , then b1259 can be used to probe the properties of stellar and pulsar winds , to study baryonic mass loading of pulsar winds , and to shed light on the complex relativistic shock dynamics .",
    "systematic monitoring of b1259 , using high - resolution x - ray , uv , optical , ir , and mm - band observations , is needed to fully utilize this unique laboratory offered by nature .",
