    "the h - mode - which usually exhibits elm bursts - is the target regime of operation for next step fusion devices e.g. iter @xcite .",
    "the elms pose a major threat to the plasma - facing components and should be controlled .",
    "a means to control elms relies on resonant magnetic perturbations ( rmps ) @xcite .",
    "since there is evidence of residual turbulence in h - mode , and the turbulence can affect the profiles and thus stability , there is no reason - a priori - to neglect turbulence effects in the elm control experiments . in other words",
    ", turbulence persists in h - mode .",
    "moreover , rmps should be activated _ before _ the 1st elm , as the latter can cause large damage to the divertor and wall . hence",
    ", understanding rmp effect on lh power threshold is crucial for iter @xcite .",
    "the rmp effect on turbulence is , to our knowledge , not broadly considered .",
    "we emphasize that _ experiments clearly show _ that rmps have an effect on turbulence @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed experimentally that rmps damp gam zonal flows , as revealed by the decrease of long - range - correlations during rmp .",
    "we have shown in refs .",
    "( @xcite ) , that drift - wave turbulence levels and associated zonal flows are modified by rmps .",
    "we used a basic representative model , i.e. an extension of the hasegawa - wakatani system to include rmp effects , neglecting the plasma response .",
    "we applied a modulational stability analysis to the latter system and coupled it to the evolution equation for turbulence energy . the resulting coupled drift wave - zonal mode ( dw - zm ) predator - prey model exhibits modified zonal flows .",
    "the underlying physical mechanisms of this modification of zonal flows are : i ) rmps tilt the magnetic field lines , thereby inducing a quasilinear @xmath4 torque .",
    "ii ) the projection of the rmp - induced quasilinear torque yields a quasilinear stress which can compete against the reynolds stress drive of zonal flows and hence damp them .",
    "we identified two asymptotic regimes , analogous to the - adiabatic electron and fluid electron - regimes of the linear hasegawa - wakatani model , depending on the strength of the rmp coupling parameter , proportional to the square of rmp amplitude [ tab .",
    "[ tab : one ] ] . in the regime where electron force balance is satisfied",
    ", the extended hasegawa - wakatani system reduces to a single equation analogous to the linear hasegawa - mima equation .",
    "the dw - zm model has two possible states , thus a bifurcation is possible for a critical value of the linear drive , i.e. input power .",
    "below threshold , the system is in a low confinement regime ( l - mode like ) , characterized by a high turbulence energy and no zonal modes . above threshold ,",
    "the system is characterized by an enhanced confinement , i.e. lower turbulence energy , due to the presence of zonal modes .",
    "this is similar to the reference case without rmps .",
    "however , in presence of rmps , the threshold for the bifurcation between these two states depends on rmp amplitude . in the weak - rmp regime ,",
    "the threshold increases linearly with the rmp coupling parameter . for sufficiently strong rmps ,",
    "the system undergoes a back - transition to l - mode .",
    "another result is that the drift - wave frequency is radially modulated by the zonal density perturbations .",
    "as the lh transition is thought to be triggered by zonal flows @xcite , our model predicts that rmps increase the lh power threshold , a key result consistent with experiments near - transition @xcite .",
    "physically , rmps enhance ( collisional ) radial transport of electrons by coupling parallel transport to the tilting of magnetic flux - surfaces . the resulting cross - field radial flux can compete with the cross - field transport of polarization charge which is the agent of guiding - center ambipolarity breaking responsible for zonal flow formation .",
    "this simple model shows that in presence of rmps , a pure drift - wave - zonal flow paradigm is no longer sufficient . with rmps ,",
    "the zonal flows , in addition to being nonlinearly coupled to primary drift - waves , are also linearly coupled to secondary zonal density perturbations @xcite , resulting in increased damping of ( secondary ) zonal flows .",
    "taking into account the mean density evolution , the density profile - sustained by the particle source - has an increased turbulent diffusion due to the increased turbulence saturation level , compared to the reference case without rmps .",
    "the later result provides one possible explanation for the puzzling _ density pump - out _ effect .",
    "this coupling mechanism - acting here on mesoscales - is quite universal and also acts on profile scales .",
    "more precisely , with rmps , the density profile - sustained by the particle source - is linearly coupled to the mean flow by the rmps .",
    "the key , bottom line result is that , through this direct coupling , the mean flow shear is decreased relative to its reference value without rmps .",
    "based on the rmp effect on zonal modes , we include mean flow shear effects , thereby extending the 0d model of ref .",
    "@xcite to include rmps .",
    "table [ tab : two ] summarizes the group of different 0d predator - prey models .",
    "this list is not exhaustive , we focus here on 0d models directly related to the present study .",
