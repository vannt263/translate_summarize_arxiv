    "this implies that the bulk and surface terms , one being the derivative of the other , contain the same information . according to padmanabhan this has relevance to both the physics of black holes and the universe as a whole .",

    "padmanabhan s general procedure to study relativity is to use accelerated noninertial rindler frames the same way einstein used inertial frames . it will not be possible to give a detailed exposition of all of padmanabhan s results in this short paper but see @xcite or @xcite  for a synopsis .",
