    "pricing financial derivatives is a main subject in mathematical finance with multiple implications in physics . in 1900 ,",
    "five years before einstein s classic paper , bachelier  @xcite proposed the _",
    "arithmetic _ brownian motion for the dynamical evolution of stock prices with the aim of obtaining a formula for option valuation .",
    "samuelson  @xcite noticed the failure of such market model that allowed negative values in stock prices , and introduced the _",
    "geometric _ brownian motion which corrects this unwanted feature . within his log - normal model ,",
    "samuelson obtained the fair price for perpetual options , although he was unable to find a general solution for expiring contracts .",
    "the answer to this question must wait until the publication of the works of black and scholes  @xcite , and merton  @xcite .",
    "the celebrated black - scholes - merton formula has been broadly used by practitioners since then , mainly due to its unambiguous interpretation and mathematical simplicity .",
    "this mathematical simplicity in the black - scholes - merton scheme has nevertheless a drawback : the model poorly adapts to those evolving conditions that affect actual derivatives and real markets present . in particular , empirical analyses conclude that volatility , roughly the diffusion parameter , must be considered as a changing ( random ) magnitude rather than a mere constant , as in the black - scholes - merton formula .",
    "many models have been developed in this direction , but among them a few deserve special emphasis because their historical imprint : the works of hull and white  @xcite , wiggins  @xcite , scott  @xcite , stein and stein  @xcite , or heston  @xcite belong to this selected group .",
    "they are collectively termed as _ stochastic volatility _",
    "models because volatility becomes a continuous process that follows its own stochastic differential equation .",
    "quite in the opposite direction we find another possible approach to the issue : the markov - modulated geometrical brownian motion models . within these models",
    "the market coefficients change in a deterministic way but at random times , and according to that they are generically known as regime - switching models . behind these lies",
    "the theory that the value of the parameters depends on the state of the economy , that suffers from seasonal changes .",
    "seeds of this idea appeared in barone - adesi and whaley  @xcite , but the first time a model of this kind was properly settled is in the work of naik  @xcite .",
    "since then such models have been used to discuss european  @xcite , russian  @xcite or american  @xcite option prices , but also in asset allocation and portfolio optimisation problems  @xcite .",
    "once we have mentioned different option flavours , we must also recall that the black - scholes - merton formula is only is applicable to european options |derivatives that can be exercised at maturity alone| , whereas most of the exchange - traded options are american |they can be exercised anytime during the life of the contract .",
    "kim  @xcite provided an integral representation of the american _ vanilla _ option price , but the explicit solution remains still unknown .",
    "the real difficulty behind pricing american options lies in the fact that one has to solve free boundary problems for partial differential equations , equations which sometimes have clear physical interpretation : mckean  @xcite , in what is the earliest approach to the issue , unambiguously speaks about the _ heat equation _ in an economic publication . here",
    "the boundary represents the optimal exercise price , the stock price that triggers the early exercise of the option , and in general one can determine it just once the pricing expression is known , what leads to a circular problem . as a consequence ,",
    "only restricted circumstances allow for closed formulas in american - like problems , whereas in the most general scenario analytical or numerical approximate methods must be used instead .",
    "one of theses favourable instances corresponds to a major simplification in the american problem : the assumption that the option never expires .",
    "non - expiring or _",
    "options serve as a good stating point in the resolution of the complete problem  @xcite because the absence of maturity usually removes any explicit temporal dependence that those differential equations present .    in this article",
    "we are going to tackle the problem of pricing perpetual american vanilla calls and puts within a market model that can be considered as a degenerated instance of a regime - switching model with only two states and where one of the transition probabilities is set to zero : we will let volatility and dividend rate perform a _",
    "regime change at some unknown instant in the future .",
    "the value before and after the regime change of such magnitudes are assumed to be known in advance , what indeed determines if the change in the dynamics has taken place or not .",
    "part of the present analysis is formally included as a limiting case in the paper by guo and zhang cited above  @xcite , where the authors studied perpetual american vanilla put options with regime switching in absence of dividends , but there are divergences as well . on the one hand , we will also pay attention to the call case . since dividend - paying assets are considered , a perpetual call may differ in price from its underlying , even though the option must not be early exercised . on the other hand ,",
    "their study on puts is complete and very general but few explicit details about the closed - form solution found are given .",
    "this is specially relevant in the analysis of the properties of the equations that determine the optimal exercise price : in essence one obtains different pricing formulas , each of them coming from an extreme value problem , and must elucidate the right choice at every moment . in spite of the multiplicity of parameters that our model involves , we will show how the value of a single magnitude answers the dilemma . therefore , there is a formal resemblance between this behaviour and a phase transition in thermodynamics .    the paper is structured as follows : in we present the market model , the securities traded in it and their general properties . in we introduce the concept of hedging portfolio and show how it can be used for pricing derivatives .",
    "is specifically devoted to perpetual american vanilla options , we settle the properties of these ideal derivatives , and stress their interest from the point of view of finance and physics as well . in",
    "we quote the analytic expressions found , and emphasize the interpretation of the optimal exercise price as the outcome of an extremal problem . in",
    "we discuss the most appealing properties and particularities of the formulas that conform the solution to the problem , by illustrating our inferences through graphical examples .",
    "conclusions are drawn in , and the paper ends with a lengthy appendix where we present step - by - step calculations for call options .",
    "let us begin with the general description of the stochastic properties of the securities that are traded in the market .",
    "the first security to be considered is a zero - coupon bond , a riskless monetary asset with a market price @xmath0 with deterministic evolution : @xmath1 where @xmath2 , the risk - free interest rate , is assumed to be constant and positive .",
    "the second security present in the market is the stock @xmath3 , whose time evolution for @xmath4 fulfils the following it stochastic differential equation ( sde ) : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is a wiener process , a one dimensional brownian motion with zero mean and variance equal to @xmath7 .",
    "the drift , @xmath8 , and the volatility , @xmath9 , are stochastic processes as well : we will assume that their initial values are @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and after that moment they may simultaneously change to some other ( different ) fixed values , @xmath12 and @xmath13 , known in advance .",
    "such a turnover can take place only once in a lifetime :   will denote the indicator function , which assigns the value 1 to a true statement , and the value 0 to a false statement . ]",
    "@xmath14 @xmath15 we state that these magnitudes are stochastic because the instant @xmath16 in which the regime change occurs is a random variable . we will consider that @xmath17 follows an exponential law with @xmath18=\\lambda^{-1}>0 $ ] .",
    "in mathematical terminology both processes are _ cdlg _ ( right - continuous with left limits ) semimartingales  @xcite . in spite of the fact that @xmath8 and @xmath19 are not continuous processes ,",
    "the price itself is continuous because we are not considering any jump contribution in  ( [ ds ] ) .",
    "therefore we may safely replace @xmath20 by @xmath3 hereafter .",
    "let us now analyse the meaning of  ( [ mu ] ) and  ( [ sigma ] ) .",
    "the case of @xmath19 is somewhat simpler since when @xmath21 we may speak of a ( elementary ) stochastic volatility market model with just two possible volatility levels .",
    "the meaning of the change in @xmath8 admits several interpretations  @xcite , but we will concentrate our attention in the existence of two different ( continuous - time ) dividend pay - off regimes , @xmath22 , @xmath23 with @xmath24 .    a third kind of securities are negotiated in the market : the derivatives of @xmath25 .",
    "derivatives  @xcite are financial instruments whose value depends on ( derives from ) present and past quotes of one or more underlying assets , which commonly are simply referred as _",
    "the underlyings_. in particular , we are interested in options : contracts between two parties that give the buyer the right , but not the obligation , to buy ( call ) or sell ( put ) shares of the underlying stock at some prearranged price , the _ strike price _",
    "@xmath26 , at or before some specific instant in the future , the maturity or expiration time @xmath27 .",
    "more precisely , we will assume that the option depends on the underlying by means of the present asset value alone , @xmath28 .",
    "however , the option price does also depend on the stochastic process @xmath29 , @xmath30 , through the market parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "the statement that an indicator function with a random variable in its argument constitutes a stochastic process may seem a delicate issue but it is mathematically correct : in fact , @xmath29 is a submartingale under our measure and , by virtue of the doob - meyer decomposition theorem  @xcite , it can be expressed as a sum of two terms , @xmath34 , the increasing adapted process @xmath35 , @xmath36 and the _ cdlg _ ( local ) martingale @xmath37 , @xmath38 .   \\ ] ] in the previous expression @xmath39 represents all the available information up to time @xmath7 , and corresponds to what is known in mathematical terminology as a filtration : an increasing one - parameter family of sub @xmath40-algebras of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , where @xmath41 is a @xmath40-algebra of subsets of the sample space @xmath44 .",
    "the sample space , @xmath41 and the measure @xmath45 |which appeared beside the expectation symbol| define the probability space ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "finally , note that maturity introduces explicit temporal dependency in the value of the option as well , so we will have that @xmath47 .    in the present case in which the price of the option is a function of two stochastic processes ,",
    "one of them with discontinuous sample paths , the appropriate it formula  @xcite reads : @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "we can infer the discontinuous nature of the option price from the presence of the last term in  ( [ itop ] ) .",
    "the differential form of this expression is : @xmath52 where the property @xmath53 has been systematically used .",
    "depending on the notation used , one can find that the @xmath54 term from the above expression is simply replaced with @xmath55 , but then one must define the random measure associated to the jumping process .",
    "we have decided not to proceed in that way because the appearance of @xmath56 in the forthcoming expressions stresses the option price dependence on a stochastic process different from @xmath57 .",
    "therefore , it is a source of risk that can not be explained in terms of the random evolution of the underlying asset . when part of the risk is not directly traded in the market , the market may be incomplete : we will not be able to reproduce the behaviour of the option by means of a replicating or _ hedging _ portfolio .",
    "the immediate consequence of such eventuality is that the risk premium coming from @xmath17 is arbitrary to a certain extent , because investors can evaluate it on the basis of their own perceptions .",
    "we will see all of this in more detail in the next section .",
    "in this section we will obtain pricing expressions for the derivatives of @xmath25 under the market conditions specified above , by resorting to the hedging - portfolio technique .",
    "this approach is based on the idea that the fair price of an option must be equal to the value of some portfolio @xmath58 made of different securities that mimics the behaviour of the derivative and hedges all the risk . if such a portfolio can be defined , the market model does not admit arbitrage  @xcite .    the first security to be included in the portfolio is the underlying asset , which will reproduce changes in the option price due to the evolution of the stock price @xmath25 .",
    "the second security in our portfolio is @xmath59 : a long position in this security will provide a secure resort where to keep the benefits of an effective trading strategy , whereas a short position in these bonds will allow us to borrow money when we need it .",
    "these two securities can not counterbalance all the stochastic behaviour of the price of the option as we have pointed out before : not all the influence of @xmath60 and @xmath19 on the option price may be explained through @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , we need another security that can account for this contribution to the global risk . since in the most usual situation markets do not trade such assets , we will consider the inclusion of a _ secondary _ option @xmath61 in the portfolio : a derivative of the same nature of @xmath62 , but with a different set of contract specifications .",
    "in particular we will assume that @xmath61 has a striking price @xmath63 , different from @xmath64 .",
    "this is a standard technique  @xcite intended to complete the market .    summing up",
    ", our aim is to reproduce the evolution of @xmath65 by means of a portfolio @xmath66 built out of a mixture of @xmath67 shares @xmath28 , @xmath68 units of the riskless security @xmath0 , and @xmath69 secondary options with value @xmath70 : @xmath71 in such a way that @xmath72 holds almost surely .",
    "the predictable _ cgld _ ( left - continuous with right limits ) processes @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 constitute what is known in mathematical finance terminology as a trading strategy , and the capital gain @xmath73 associated to it is given by : @xmath74 where the last term represents the amount of money received as dividends .",
    "the cost process @xmath75 associated to the strategy is just the difference between the value of the portfolio @xmath66 and the revenues @xmath73 , @xmath76 , and the trading strategy is said to be _ self - financing _",
    "if @xmath77 , because in that case there is no net cash flow entering or leaving the replicating portfolio  @xcite .",
    "when @xmath77 the variation in the value of the portfolio @xmath78 coincides with the change in the capital gain @xmath79 : @xmath80    now we have to demand to that sde  ( [ dp ] ) matches  ( [ itodp ] ) : @xmath81 in an analogous way to @xmath82 , @xmath83 follows a sde , @xmath84 where @xmath85 we may now combine  ( [ db ] ) and  ( [ dq ] ) with equation  ( [ pde_1 ] ) and get : @xmath86{{\\rm d}}t= \\nonumber \\\\",

    "\\label{pde_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in order to transform  ( [ pde_2 ] ) from a sde into a deterministic partial differential equation we must guarantee that terms containing the stochastic magnitudes @xmath57 and @xmath56 cancel out , by selecting the self - financing trading strategy .",
    "therefore , we must demand that @xmath87 a condition named _ delta hedging _ , and also that @xmath88 which is usually referred as _",
    "vega hedging_. the previous hedging conditions reduce  ( [ pde_2 ] ) to @xmath89 an expression that still involves @xmath90 .",

    "moreover , let us restrict our considerations to a subset in which we have simultaneously @xmath115 and @xmath116 |note that both quantities are predictable .",
    "the only thing we ought to do in order to obtain what is known as a `` free lunch '' , _",
    "i.e. _ sure earnings without capital exposure , is to wait until convenient market conditions are reached and costless construct @xmath117 immediately , because then @xmath118 .",
    "the possibility of performing this kind of investment is named _",
    "arbitrage opportunity _ , and it constitutes an undesirable feature of any market model . even if @xmath119 we would get a `` free ticket '' for a lottery , @xmath120 with probability @xmath121 |the regime change either takes place| and @xmath122 with probability @xmath123 |or not .",
    "note that if @xmath124 the trick is to compose the reverse portfolio . finally , the conclusion is valid for @xmath125 as well , because @xmath126 and @xmath127 are continuous in @xmath7 and @xmath28 .",
    "@xmath128 is the only strong constraint on this magnitude , which depends in essence on how every investor measures volatility and dividend risks , that are not traded in the market .",
    "since @xmath129 can not be unambiguously settled , the market is not complete strictly speaking .",
    "therefore one must resort to some sound financial criteria to choose @xmath129 .",
    "a conventional choice is the one that removes the so - called statistical arbitrage that appears when the growth of the expected value of a null portfolio is different from zero . in our case",
    "this is attained under the measure @xmath45 if @xmath130 , since then for @xmath131 we have @xmath132= \\left(\\lambda - \\xi_a \\right)\\delta p_{t-}{{\\rm d}}t=0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "the main assumption that determines the range of validity of equation  ( [ xi ] ) is the irrelevance of past values of the underlying in the valuation of the derivative .",
    "this constraint is satisfied for any option whose value at the exercise time , @xmath133 , depends only on the present price of the underlying , @xmath134 , and @xmath133 itself : @xmath135 when the option can be exercised at the end of the contract lifetime only , @xmath136 , the exercise time is deterministic , and the option is said to be european . if the option can be exercised at any time before expiration it is called american , and @xmath133 becomes a stochastic magnitude as well .",
    "note that the contract is always worthless after maturity , @xmath137 , and therefore the option buyer must decide under which conditions the option can be optimally exercised before this deadline . since the decision",
    "may be based on @xmath28 and the natural time variable , the time to maturity , @xmath138 , one deduces that the optimal exercise boundary , the stock price for which it is better to exercise the option than to keep it alive , will be of the form @xmath139 , with the usual auxiliary expressions @xmath140 and @xmath141 assumed .",
    "the very definition of @xmath142 entails that for any live american option it holds that @xmath143 and that @xmath144 must be settled in such a way that relationship @xmath145 is satisfied . as a consequence , the computation of the option price and the optimal exercise boundary must be tackled contemporarily .",
    "here lies the root of the difficulty in pricing american derivatives : first one must solve the partial differential equation  ( [ xi ] ) for any possible boundary condition , @xmath146 , @xmath147 and then infer the value of @xmath144 from some other financial argument .",
    "note that option holders try to delay the exercise of the option as much as they can , since the worth of a live option is never lower than the pay - off of the contingent claim ,  ( [ better_alive ] ) .",
    "then @xmath144 is the function that maximizes the price of the option with respect to the boundary condition : @xmath148 when the pay - off function is regular enough , the above demand is equivalent to the classical smooth pasting condition that states  @xcite : @xmath149 in conclusion , the option price must be continuous with continuous derivative in the asset price when it crosses the boundary .",
    "few closed solutions for this general problem are known even when the stock price follows a standard geometric brownian motion . in particular",
    "the question stands open for the most ubiquitous pay - off function , @xmath150 this kind of derivatives are known as _ vanilla _ options , and the plus ( respectively minus ) superscript stands for call ( respectively put ) options .",
    "the difficulty deceases dramatically if one can deduce the way in which the optimal exercise boundary depends on time .",
    "this is the case when the option is perpetual , when it does not mature .",
    "it can be objected that perpetual american options have limited practical interest since actual derivatives commonly expire . however , since they can be understood as an approximation of a far - from - maturity contract , perpetual options may help in the valuation process when theoretical prices can not be computed  @xcite .",
    "moreover , as we will stress later , the emerging problem is still akin to physics because it involves mechanical or thermodynamic concepts like equilibrium and stability .",
    "we will translate now the absence - of - expiration assumption into our expressions by letting @xmath151 .",
    "this will remove any _",
    "explicit _ temporal dependence from @xmath65 , @xmath152 and from @xmath144 , @xmath153 .",
    "so , the remaining _ implicit _ time dependence in @xmath142 is fruit of a possible future change in the dynamics exclusively , and therefore @xmath154 with @xmath155 and @xmath156 non - negative constants to be determined .",
    "in this section we will present the solution to equations  ( [ xi_a ] ) and  ( [ xi_b ] ) , with @xmath130 , when the pay - off function is  ( [ vpo ] ) . the detailed derivation of the expressions to appear can be found in  [ aa ] for the case of call options , and one may use the procedure developed there as a guideline for finding put formulas .    after the regime change we will have  @xcite :   hereafter for notational brevity . ]",
    "@xmath157 with @xmath158 here and hereafter we will denote by @xmath159 the following combination of the model parameters @xmath2 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 : @xmath162 where @xmath163 is a shorthand for @xmath164 note that @xmath165 .",
    "in fact , one can prove that @xmath166 and @xmath167 , where equalities hold if and only if @xmath168 .",

    "as we have explained above one can recover @xmath181 by demanding the so - called smooth pasting condition  ( [ smooth ] ) on the solution  ( [ vcaputa1 ] ) .",
    "this one is the approach we follow in the appendix because it naturally provides ordinary differential equations with cauchy boundary conditions on @xmath182 . here",
    "we will show how  ( [ smooth ] ) is just a consequence of the general maximal principle  ( [ max ] ) which in this case takes the form : @xmath183 if one differentiates  ( [ vcaputa1 ] ) with respect to @xmath181 gets @xmath184 where we have defined the auxiliary function @xmath185 , @xmath186 and the constant positive - definite coefficients   @xmath187 therefore we have to look for @xmath188 , @xmath189 , because then the value of @xmath181 will follow , @xmath190 it is shown in the appendix that function @xmath191 has one and only one zero in the interval @xmath192 , but the same kind of analysis performed there leads to the conclusion that @xmath193 has a single solution in @xmath194 . thus the problem is properly settled .    when @xmath195 the optimal exercise price for vanilla calls ( respectively puts ) is higher ( respectively lower ) before the regime change than after it .",

    "there are some other situations with deeper financial relevance that deserve a closer study",
    ". we will introduce and illustrate them in the next section .",
    "let us analyse in the first place the consequences on call option prices of a stoppage in the payment of dividends , @xmath210 and @xmath211 .",
    "after the change we have @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and @xmath214 .",
    "this ensures that the right choice here is the solution for which @xmath215 .",

    "this result has its origins in the uneven rights that option holders and stock owners have before the change due to the dividend payment .",
    "remember that after the change @xmath225 , so the call holder must face the following dilemma : if the option is not exercised there is still a chance for the sudden revaluation of the option price , since @xmath226 , but at the same time , the longer he / she waits the higher is the amount of dividends he / she will never receive .",
    "the optimal exercise price @xmath222 comes from a trade - off between these two competing reasons .",
    "thus the difference disappears if we consider the limit @xmath227 : we can see how we recover @xmath228 , the option is never exercised also in this case , and @xmath229 as well . therefore if the share pays no dividend at all , american call options quote as its underlying even if the volatility changes .",
    "let us assume next that @xmath230 but with @xmath231 , the stock can start suddenly to pay dividends . since @xmath232 the appropriate pricing expressions follows from  ( [ vcaputa2 ] ) and  ( [ vcaputa3 ] ) , and @xmath233 should be a zero of the auxiliary function @xmath234 .",
    "the first point that deserves attention is the fact that in this case we have @xmath235 , @xmath236 and , as a consequence , @xmath234 is strictly positive .",
    "then the only way in which one can satisfy the maximal condition  ( [ maxh ] ) is by demanding that @xmath237 .",
    "this conclusion must hold regardless the value of the rest of the parameters in general , and @xmath238 in particular .",
    "the validity of this result was already conjectured in  @xcite , but no prove was given there . note that in this case the price of the call differs from the underlying , @xmath224 , due to the existence of the post - change scenario , @xmath239 : @xmath240 and @xmath241 only in the limit @xmath242 , the solution @xmath243 is recovered .",
    "figure  [ figca2d0 ] shows how @xmath222 increases when one considers lower and lower values for @xmath244 , until the limit @xmath230 is attained . in this case",
    "the price never intersects the pay - off function .    ) , for different values of @xmath244 .",
    "we observe how both the optimal exercise price and the option price itself increase as @xmath244 tends to zero .",
    "when @xmath230 the option price never touches the pay - off function , depicted in a solid black line . we have used the following values for the parameters : @xmath245 , @xmath246 , @xmath247 and @xmath248 years.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ]    another aspect of the previous solutions that it is worthwhile devoting attention to is the behaviour of those expressions out of their range of validity .",
    "as we have pointed out in the previous section , and partially shown in the appendix , equation @xmath203 has a unique solution in the interval @xmath204 when @xmath195 .",
    "the fact is that if one considers arbitrary relative values for @xmath159 and expands the domain of @xmath249 to the whole positive real axis , it _ always _ presents a single zero , because @xmath250 , @xmath251 , and the function is either monotonous or has a single local extreme .",
    "therefore one can compute @xmath252 , @xmath253 , when @xmath254 , and compare it with the right value @xmath255 .",
    "the same kind of analysis can be performed on the two associated pricing expressions : @xmath256 , the correct one in the present circumstances , found in  ( [ vcaputa1 ] ) , and the heuristic one @xmath257 , obtained by using formula  ( [ vcaputa2 ] ) . note that solution  ( [ vcaputa3 ] ) does not apply in any case .",
    "this is not a mere academic exercise , because both expressions solve the _ same _ equation , namely  ( [ odecalla1 ] ) for call options , and @xmath258 still obeys to a maximization principle .",
    "the divergence emerges as a consequence of the different boundary conditions to be satisfied : in particular it is no longer true that @xmath259 .",
    "since this condition is deduced from arguments on optimality , one can consider the heuristic expression as a non - optimal solution . in figure  [ figprel ]",
    "we can observe the relative difference between pricing expressions , @xmath260 , for a perpetual put option in a market model with @xmath261 and @xmath262 .    ) , for different values of @xmath263 , expressed in years .",
    "we analyse here the difference between expressions  ( [ vcaputa1 ] ) and  ( [ vcaputa2 ] ) when a sudden increment in the volatility of the stock is presumed .",
    "we have used the following values for the parameters : @xmath245 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 and @xmath266 . note",
    "how the right solution dictates a higher price.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=80.0% ]    the heuristic solution underprices the put in a quantity that reduces for large and small values of @xmath25 and @xmath95 , because then the mismatch in the boundary reduces its relevance . in any case , the error introduced by the heuristic pricing expression in the terms analysed is relatively small and bounded .",
    "in fact , as we show below with a different example , if we simply superimposed the two prices in a single plot it would seem that they just collapse .",
    "besides @xmath267 we have also @xmath268 .",
    "this is tenable because the sudden change in the heuristic solution at @xmath269 , clearly noticeable in figure  [ figprel ] .",
    "@xmath270 also crosses the pay - off function at @xmath271 , what reinforces the heuristic character of the solution .",
    "let us consider now the opposite situation in which one tries to use  ( [ vcaputa1 ] ) instead of expressions  ( [ vcaputa2])-([vcaputa3 ] ) when @xmath272 .",
    "the immediate conclusion is that in this case  ( [ vcaputa1 ] ) does not solve the appropriate differential equation , because @xmath273    settled , but right boundary conditions are to be satisfied eventually .",
    "this may result into incompatibility .",
    "note that @xmath274 , and @xmath275 as well .",
    "this implies here that @xmath276 has either two zeros or none .",
    "if @xmath277 we have stated that the problem has always a univocal solution , but when @xmath272 it is possible that no extremal solution can be defined . this problem was already detected and depicted in  @xcite . in figure  [ fig3ok ]",
    "we observe how , for a given market conditions , no heuristic solution can be found beyond a critical value of @xmath95 , @xmath278 . once again the value of the heuristic optimal exercise price is smaller than @xmath279 , and since the heuristic solution fulfils all the boundary conditions , it overprices the value of the option .    ) , for different values of @xmath95 , expressed in years@xmath280 , when one awaits a severe reduction in the volatility of the stock .",
    "we observe how right prices ( solid lines ) coincide optically with heuristic ones ( dots ) up to the threshold @xmath278 is attained , even for large stock prices |see the inset . for higher values of @xmath95",
    "we have only the correct solution .",

    "in this article we have obtained the complete set of analytic pricing expressions for perpetual american vanilla options within a market model that may present a single change of regime in both the dividend - payment rate and the volatility level of the underlying stock .",
    "we further assume that the value of these parameters after the change are known quantities .",
    "the problem is relevant from the point of view of mathematical finance and shows interesting connections with physics .",
    "the most exciting financial result is perhaps that the price of a perpetual american vanilla call when the underlying does not pay dividends may differ from the spot price of the stock , regardless the fact that the option will be never early exercised as long as the market conditions remain fixed .",
    "the risk associated to the fact that this non - dividend policy can be eventually revised in the future reduces the value of the option .    on the realms of physics one",
    "finds certain parallelisms between some properties shown by this model and phase transitions in thermodynamics : when one analyses the issue before the regime change , two different formulas are found for both the price of the option and the optimal exercise boundary , and the appropriate expression to be used is elucidated on the basis of the value of a some sort of  order parameter \" .",
    "this analogy with thermodynamics extends to the mutual relationship between the two available exercise prices . like state functions in thermodynamics , exercise prices characterize equilibrium states in the sense that they are solutions to extreme value problems .",
    "when two possible values for a function of state coexist , the one that is smaller ( or larger , depending on the state quantity analysed ) is seen as the stable solution , whereas the alternative solution is named as metastable . in our case",
    "this kind of behaviour is observed , and one can trace the reason back to the same origin : each solution reflects different environmental conditions , and only one of them incorporates the actual constraints . and as in physical problems , the metastable solution may become eventually unstable and just disappear .",
    "we have shown how this phenomenon was on the basis of the spurious bizarre results reported in  @xcite .",

    "let us consider the case of call options in detail .",
    "the equation to be solved if the regime has changed is  ( [ xi_b ] ) : @xmath287 whose general solution reads @xmath288 where @xmath170 first appeared in  ( [ betapm ] ) .",

    "@xmath292 is obtained after ( [ vb_2 ] ) , @xmath293 and therefore  @xcite : @xmath294 the value of @xmath295 emerges from  ( [ vb_3 ] ) : @xmath296 it can be proven that @xmath297 , and that @xmath298 is equivalent to @xmath211 . therefore we will have @xmath299 for @xmath300 , and for @xmath298 the value of @xmath295 diverges : there is no optimal boundary , the option is never exercised and quotes as the underlying stock , @xmath301 note that  ( [ call_b ] ) is valid for @xmath302 , whereas the value of the call for @xmath303 is just @xmath304 .",
    "some remarks about this statement can become very revealing for a better understanding of future developments .",
    "the exercise price of a call marks the threshold above which it is better to execute the option rather than to keep it alive .",
    "however , this does not ensure that one will be able to exercise the option exactly when @xmath305 .",
    "let us think , for instance , in the case of a market with quantified quotes ,   and observe how in general the _ executed _ price will exceed the optimal exercise price unless it coincides with one of the admissible prices . in our case , the process @xmath28 is continuous but the optimal exercise price is not , it changes from @xmath306 to @xmath295 , what can end in the same result if @xmath307 .",
    "let us consider now the call price before the change , the one we are primarily interested in .",
