    "one of the unequivocal characteristics of string theory @xcite is its possession of a fundamental length scale which determines the typical spacetime extension of a fundamental string .",

    "moreover , @xmath3 is understood to be the _ minimal length _ below which spacetime distances can not be resolved @xcite : @xmath4 quantum theory , on the other hand , is completely oblivious to the presence of such a scale , despite its being the putative infrared limit of string theory . a natural question to ask is ,",
    "therefore , whether the formalism of quantum theory can be deformed or extended in such a way as to consistently incorporate the minimal length .",
    "if it is at all possible , the precise manner in which quantum theory must be modified may point to solutions of yet unresolved mysteries such as the cosmological constant problem @xcite , which is quantum gravitational in its origin .",
    "it should also illuminate the nature of string theory @xcite , whence quantum theory must emerge @xcite .",
    "the idea of introducing a minimal length into quantum theory has a fascinating and long history .",
    "it was used by heisenberg in 1930 @xcite to address the infinities of the newly formulated theory of quantum electodynamics @xcite . over the years",
    ", the idea has been picked up by many authors in a plethora of contexts , e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite to list just a few .",
    "various ways to deform or extend quantum theory have also been suggested @xcite . in this paper , we focus our attention on how a minimal length can be introduced into quantum mechanics by modifing its algebraic structure @xcite .",
    "the starting point of our analysis is the minimal length uncertainty relation ( mlur ) @xcite , @xmath5 which is suggested by a re - summed perturbation expansion of the string - string scattering amplitude in a flat spacetime background @xcite .",
    "this is essentially a heisenberg microscope argument @xcite in the s - matrix language @xcite with fundamental strings used to probe fundamental strings .",
    "the first term inside the parentheses on the right - hand side is the usual heisenberg term coming from the shortening of the probe - wavelength as momentum is increased , while the second - term can be understood as due to the lengthening of the probe string as more energy is pumped into it : @xmath6 eq .",
    "( [ mlur ] ) implies that the uncertainty in position , @xmath7 , is bounded from below by the string length scale , @xmath8 where the minimum occurs at @xmath9 thus , @xmath10 is the minimal length below which spatial distances can not be resolved , consistent with eq .",
    "( [ minimallength ] ) .",
    "in fact , the mlur can be motivated by fairly elementary general relativistic considerations independent of string theory , which suggests that it is a universal feature of quantum gravity @xcite .    note that in the trans - planckian momentum region @xmath11 , the mlur is dominated by the behavior of eq .",
    "( [ dpproptodx ] ) , which implies that large @xmath12 ( uv ) corresponds to large @xmath7 ( ir ) , and that there exists a correspondence between uv and ir physics .",
    "such uv / ir relations have been observed in various string dualities @xcite , and in the context of ads / cft correspondence @xcite ( albeit between the bulk and boundary theories ) . thus , the mlur captures another distinguishing feature of string theory .",
    "in addition to the mlur , another uncertainty relation has been pointed out by yoneya as characteristic of string theory .",
    "this is the so - called spacetime uncertainty relation ( stur ) @xmath13 which can be motivated in a somewhat hand - waving manner by combining the usual energy - time uncertainty relation @xmath14 @xcite with eq .",
    "( [ dpproptodx ] ) .",
    "however , it can also be supported via an analysis of d0-brane scattering in certain backgrounds in which @xmath7 can be made arbitrary small at the expense of making the duration of the interaction @xmath15 arbitrary large @xcite .",
    "while the mlur pertains to dynamics of a particle in a non - dynamic spacetime , the stur can be interpreted to pertain to the dynamics of spacetime itself in which the size of a quantized spacetime cell is preserved .    in the following ,",
    "we discuss how the mlur and stur may be incorporated into quantum mechanics via a deformation and/or extension of its algebraic structure . in section  ii",
    ", we introduce a deformation of the canonical commutation relation between @xmath16 and @xmath17 which leads to the mlur , and discuss its phenomenological consequences . in section  iii , we take the classical limit by replacing commutation relations with poisson brackets and derive the analogue of liouville s theorem in the deformed mechanics .",
    "we then discuss the effect this has on the density of states in phase space . in section",
    "iv , we discuss the implications of the mlur on the cosmological constant problem . we conclude in section  v with some speculations on how the stur may be incorporated via a nambu triple bracket , and comment on the lessons for the foundations of string theory and on the question `` what is string theory ?

    "if we identify @xmath207 , then we must have @xmath215 , which is even more problematic than @xmath210 .",
    "as these considerations show , our simple choice for @xmath26 and @xmath216 succeeds in rendering the cosmological constant finite , but does not provide an adequate suppression .",
    "would some other choice of @xmath26 and @xmath216 do better ? to this end , let us try to see whether we can reverse engineer these functions so that the correct order of magnitude is obtained .",
    "let us write @xmath217 to generate the correct value for the cosmological constant , we must have @xmath218 , as we have seen . at this point",
    ", we invoke some numerology and note that if the susy breaking scale @xmath219 is on the order of a few @xmath220 , then the seesaw formula , @xmath221 would give the correct size for @xmath222 as observed by banks @xcite .",
    "this expression is reminiscent of the well - known seesaw mechanism used to explain the smallness of neutrino masses @xcite .",
    "one way to obtain this result is to have the density of states scale as @xmath223 , and place the uv cutoff at @xmath219 , beyond which the bosonic and fermionic contributions cancel .",
    "this would yield @xmath224 .",
    "unfortunately , this density of states is problematic since @xmath225 for the entire integration region , so we are effectively suppressing everything .",
    "furthermore , to obtain this suppression , we must have @xmath226 , making the effective value of @xmath164 , and thus the size of the quantum cell , huge at low energies in clear contradiction to reality .",
    "in retrospect , this result is not surprising since raising the uv cutoff from @xmath227 to much higher values naturally requires the drastic suppression of contributions from below the cutoff .",
    "thus , it is clear that the modification to the density of states , as suggested by the mlur , by itself can not solve the cosmological constant problem .      in the above discussion of summing over momentum states ,",
    "the unstated assumption was that states at different momentum scales were independent , and that their total effect on the vacuum energy was the simple sum of their individual contributions .",
    "of course , this assumption is the basis of the decoupling between small ( ir ) and large ( uv ) momentum scales which underlies our use of effective field theories .",
    "however , there are hints that this assumption is what needs to be reevaluated in order to solve the cosmological constant problem .",
    "first and foremost , the expression for the vacuum energy density itself , @xmath228 , is dependent upon an ir scale @xmath211 and a uv scale @xmath229 , suggesting that whatever theory that explains its value must be aware of both scales , and have some type of dynamical connection between them .",
    "note that effective qft s are not of this type but string theory is , given the uv / ir mixing relations discovered in several contexts as mentioned in the introduction .",
    "second , the contributions of the sub - planckian modes ( @xmath230 ) independently by themselves are clearly too large , and there is a limit to the tweaking that can be done to the density of states in the ir since those modes undeniably exist . the only way out of the dilemma would be to cancel the contribution of the ir sub - planckian modes against those of something else , say that coming from the uv trans - planckian modes ( @xmath231 ) by introducing a dynamical connection between the two regimes @xcite .",
    "that the sub - planckian ( @xmath230 ) and trans - planckian ( @xmath231 ) modes should cancel against each other is also suggested by the following argument : consider how the mlur , eq .",
    "( [ mlur2 ] ) , would be realized in field theory .",
    "the usual heisenberg relation @xmath232 is a simple consequence of the fact that coordinate and momentum spaces are fourier transforms of each other .",
    "the more one wishes to localize a wave - packet in coordinate space ( smaller @xmath7 ) , the more momentum states one must superimpose ( larger @xmath12 ) . in the usual case",
    ", there is no lower bound to @xmath7 : one may localize the wave - packet as much as one likes by simply superimposing states with ever larger momentum , and thus ever shorter wavelength , to cancel out the tails of the coordinate space distributions .",
    "on the other hand , the mlur implies that if one keeps on superimposing states with momenta beyond @xmath233 , then @xmath7 ceases to decrease and starts increasing instead .",
    "( see fig  [ mlurfig ] . )",
    "the natural interpretation of such a phenomenon would be that the trans - planckian modes ( @xmath231 ) when superimposed with the sub - planckian ones ( @xmath230 ) would ` jam ' the sub - planckian modes and prevent them from canceling out the tails of the wave - packets effectively .",
    "the mechanism we envision here is analogous to the ` jamming ' behavior seen in non - equilibrium statistical physics , in which systems are found to freeze with increasing temperature @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been argued that such `` freezing by heating '' could be characteristic of a background independent quantum theory of gravity @xcite .",
    "we should also note , that in our calculation presented above , the phase space over which the integration was performed was fixed and flat .",
    "quantum gravity will naturally change the situation , leading to a fluctuating dynamical spacetime background .",
    "furthermore , the mlur implies that energy - momentum space will be a fluctuating dynamical entity as well @xcite .",
    "first , the necessity of `` jamming '' between the sub - planckian and trans - planckian modes to implement the mlur in field theory clearly illustrates that momentum space can not be the simple fourier transform of coordinate space , but must rather be an independent entity .",
    "second , the quantum properties of spacetime geometry may be understood in terms of effective expressions that involve the spacetime uncertainties : @xmath234 the uv / ir relation @xmath235 in the trans - planckian region implies that this geometry of spacetime uncertainties can be transferred directly to the space of energy - momentum uncertainties , endowing it with a geometry as well : @xmath236 the usual intuition that local properties in spacetime correspond to non - local features of energy - momentum space ( as implied by the canonical uncertainty relations ) is obviated by the linear relation between the uncertainties in coordinate space and momentum space .",
    "what would a dynamical energy - momentum space entail ? let us speculate .",
    "it has been argued that a dynamical spacetime , with its foamy uv structure @xcite , would manifest itself in the ir via the uncertainties in the measurements of global spacetime distances as @xcite : @xmath237 a relation which is reminiscent of the famous result for brownian motion derived by einstein @xcite , and is also covariant in @xmath238 dimensions .",
    "let us assume that a similar ` brownian ' relation holds in energy - momentum space due to its ` foaminess ' @xcite : @xmath239 if the energy - momentum space has a finite size , a natural uv cutoff , at @xmath240 , then its fluctuation @xmath241 will be given by @xmath242 .",
    "the mlur implies that the mode at this scale must cancel , or ` jam , ' against another which shares the same @xmath7 , namely , the mode with an uncertainty given by @xmath243 , that is : @xmath244 all modes between @xmath245 and @xmath246 will ` jam . '",
    "therefore , @xmath245 will be the effective uv cutoff of the momentum integral and not @xmath246 , which would yield @xmath247 this reproduces the seesaw formula , eq .",
    "( [ seesaw ] ) , and if @xmath248 , we obtain the correct cosmological constant .",
    "in the concluding section we wish to discuss a few implications of our work for non - perturbative string theory and the question : what is string theory @xcite ?",
    "our discussion of this difficult question , being limited by the scope of our work on the minimal length , will neccesarily be a bit speculative .",
    "our toy model for the mlur was essentially algebraic .",
    "as such , it raises the possibility that more general algebraic structures may play a key role in non - perturbative string theory . in the introductory section",
    ", we mentioned that the mlur is motivated by the scattering of string like excitations in first quantized string theory .",
    "if one takes into account other objects in non - perturbative string theory , such as @xmath63-branes , one is lead to the stur , eq .",
    "( [ stur ] ) , proposed by yoneya .",

    "another hint of cubic algebraic structure appears in the non - perturbative formulation of open string field theory by witten @xcite .",

    "we recall that in the ads / cft correspondence , one computes the on - shell bulk action @xmath270 and relates it to the appropriate boundary correlators .",
    "the conjecture is that the generating functional of the vacuum correlators of the operator @xmath271 for a @xmath119-dimensional conformal field theory ( cft ) is given by the partition function @xmath272 in ( anti - de - sitter ) ads@xmath273 space : @xmath274 \\;,\\ ] ] where in the semiclassical limit the partition function becomes @xmath275 . here",

    "this would mesh nicely with the ideas presented in refs .",

    "this leads to the question of background independence and vacuum selection .",
    "the issue of background independence in string theory is that the fundamental equations should not select a quantum theory the same way einstein s gravitational equations do not select any geometry ; only asymptotic or symmetry conditions select a geometry .",
