    "one of the most nontrivial and striking observations of relativistic thermodynamics @xcite is that probability distributions can depend on frames .",

    "recently , relativistic quantum information theory has attracted particular interests @xcite .",
    "current investigations show that a single quantum spin is not covariant under lorentz transformations @xcite , and maximal entanglement between spins in the rest frame will most likely degrade due to mixing with the momentum if viewed from a moving frame @xcite , depending on the initial momentum wave function . for many quantum information protocols",
    "@xcite , coherence and entanglement are extremely important and expensive .",
    "the observation that coherence and entanglement of the reduced state for spins may degrade when viewed in moving frames implies that there are particular problems for relativistic quantum information processing , particularly for relativistic quantum communication .",
    "it is known that , for a single quantum spin , if and only if we consider the momentum eigenstates ( plane waves ) , can the reduced density matrix for the spin be covariant under lorentz transformations . but momentum eigenstates are not localized so they may be difficult in feasible applications @xcite .",
    "the similar difficulties exist for multipartite states @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the lorentz boost - induced decrease in the purity of the reduced density matrix for spins , when a state which has pure reduced state for spins in the rest frame is viewed from a moving reference frame . taken to the leading order ,",
    "the decrease in spin purity observed in the moving frame is linear with respect to the momentum mean square deviation observed in the rest frame , which according to the position - momentum uncertainty relationship can be reasonably regarded as a measure of how much the spacial wave package is localized .",
    "we also present numerical studies as instance of our general analysis .",
    "furthermore , we prove that , for any localized pure state with separable spin and momentum in the rest frame , its reduced density matrix for spins can not be covariant under any lorentz boosts , i.e. it inevitably appears to be mixed when viewed from a moving reference frame . considering that in practical applications states should be localized",
    ", our results may have important consequences for relativistic quantum information processing .",
    "we start by briefly recalling peres et al.s paper @xcite . consider a spin half massive particle ( of mass @xmath1 ) that is prepared with spin in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "the spin state can be represented by the bloch vector @xmath3 with @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",

    "the spin and momentum may appear to be entangled , thus the purity of spins may appear to degrade viewed by this observer .",

    "( [ eq 4 ] ) . as the momentum mean square deviation increases , corresponding to stronger localization , the boost - induced decrease in spin purity increases monotonously .",
    "the deviation from linearity is due to terms of higher than second orders , such as @xmath112 and @xmath113 etc .",

    "this requirement excludes nonlocalized states , such as momentum eigenstates and the singular ones presented in ref .",

    "( [ eq 2 ] ) now turns to be the lebesgue integral over @xmath126 : @xmath127    since the state is localized , @xmath128 must be integrable .",
    "in addition , @xmath129^{2}=1 $ ] implies that @xmath128 is bounded almost everywhere .",
    "hence one must have @xmath130 @xcite . otherwise supposing @xmath131 , one necessarily encounters the contradiction that @xmath132 and @xmath133 .    denote @xmath134 and @xmath135 . it can be easily verified that @xmath136has lebesgue measure zero in @xmath137 for any given @xmath7 when @xmath54 does not degenerate to a pure three - dimensional rotation . then , using the tonelli s theorem @xcite , one obtains @xmath138",
