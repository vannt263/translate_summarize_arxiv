    "synthetic spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) , a recent addition to the toolbox available for quantum simulation in ultracold atomic gases , can give rise to interesting two - body and many - body properties by modifying the single - particle dispersion spectrum of the underlying system @xcite . in ultracold fermi gases , it has been shown that the implementation of synthetic soc can lead to an unconventional superfluid with non - trivial topological features , or a superfluid with non - zero center - of - mass ( com ) momentum , or a combination of both , depending on the spatial dimensions of the gas , and on the form of synthetic soc implemented @xcite .",
    "most of these studies have assumed the system to be close to a feshbach resonance , so that the interaction is tunable via an external magnetic field .",
    "however , to characterize the feshbach resonance , most of the previous studies on spin - orbit coupled fermi systems have adopted a single - channel model @xcite . while on a phenomenological level , a two - channel model is more appropriate , where the feshbach resonance is described as a multi - channel resonant scattering process when the bound state in a closed channel is tuned close to the continuum threshold of an open channel @xcite .",
    "the two - channel model reduces to a single - channel model only when the population of the closed channel molecule becomes negligible , which is not always the case , particularly under soc @xcite .",
    "recently , there have been several studies using two - channel models for the characterization of spin - orbit coupled fermi gases near a feshbach resonance @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting finding is that the soc can induce a new branch of two - body bound state .",
    "while it has been reported before that in the absence of soc , two branches of bound state can be found near a feshbach resonance for a fermi gas with positive background scattering length , the extra bound state under negative background scattering length is purely induced by soc .",
    "the existence of this new two - body bound state should leave signatures on the many - body level .",
    "indeed , for a fermi gas without soc , a quantum phase transition exists for a positive background scattering length , which is intimately connected with the corresponding two - body bound state @xcite .",
    "we expect that similar phase transitions may appear in a spin - orbit coupled fermi gas when the proper two - channel resonant scattering process is considered .    in this work ,",
    "we study an ultracold fermi gas under rashba soc close to a feshbach resonance using a two - channel model .",
    "we first confirm the two - body calculations in refs .",
    "@xcite , and study the branching of the two - body bound state in the presence of a finite background scattering length . for a positive background scattering length , the open channel supports a bound state even in the absence of soc , and the two branches of two - body bound state originate from the avoided level crossing between the bound states in the open and the closed channels . for a negative background scattering length ,",
    "an soc - induced bound state emerges in the open channel for any finite soc .",
    "the soc - induced bound state then couples with the bound state in the closed channel , also leading to two branches of bound state .    with these understandings ,",
    "we characterize many - body properties of the system using a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) mean field approach . as expected , we find two - branches of many - body solutions , the upper and the lower branch , for any finite background scattering length . with a positive background scattering length , we find that the lower branch is always bosonic with negative chemical potential , essentially a condensate of tightly bound molecules .",
    "a quantum phase transition exists in the upper branch , across which the ground state of the fermi gas changes from a superfluid state to a normal state .",
    "the position of the phase transition can be controlled by tuning the soc strength .",
    "we also notice that by tuning the interaction or the soc strength , a bardeen - cooper - schrieffer to bose - einstein condensate ( bcs - bec ) crossover occurs in the upper branch . with a negative background scattering length ,",
    "the upper branch emerges from the scattering threshold on the low - field - side of the feshbach resonance via a quantum phase transition for any finite soc .",
    "we discuss in detail the many - body properties of different branches under various parameters , and characterize the critical detuning for the onset of the quantum phase transition .",
    "we show that the results in this work , the quantum phase transitions in particular , should best be observed in narrow feshbach resonances under appropriate soc .",
    "while experimentally , only an equal mixture of rashba and dresselhaus soc has been realized in cold atomic gases @xcite , there have been various proposals for realizing the rashba - type soc @xcite . with the recent experimental implementation of feshbach resonance in spin - orbit coupled degenerate fermi gases @xcite , we expect that the soc - induced quantum phase transition reported here can be experimentally probed in the future .",

    "ii , we introduce the two - channel model for a fermi gas under rashba soc and close to a feshbach resonance . in sec .",
    "iii , we study the two - body bound state solutions under a finite background scattering length . in sec .",

    "there exists a weakly - bound state in the open channel away from the fesbach resonance . as the magnetic field",
    "is tuned close to the resonance point , the coupling between the bound states in the open and the closed channels gives rise to the two branches of many - body solution in the absence of soc .",
    "previous studies have shown the existence of a quantum phase transition in the upper branch where the many - body ground state changes from a superfluid state to a normal state @xcite .",

    "an interesting feature here is the existence of a quantum phase transition , whose location can be identified as the detuning where the order parameter approaches zero [ see fig .",
    "[ abgzug ] ( a ) ] . as the resonance width narrows , the location of the phase transition point moves towards the bec - side of the feshbach resonance .",
    "importantly , with appropriate resonance width and soc strength , the location of the quantum phase transition point may cross the feshbach resonance and reach the bec side , as we will show in sec .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ abgzug](d - f ) the properties of the lower branch , which corresponds to the deeply - bound state in the two - body case .",

    "physically , the solution in the lower branch corresponds to a condensate of tightly bound molecules , which become rashbons in the large soc limit  @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the case with negative background scattering length @xmath71 . in the absence of soc , there is only one branch of many - body solution , which features a bcs - bec crossover as the interaction strength is tuned @xcite . when soc is turned on ,",
    "however , this picture is drastically modified .",
    "similar to the two - body case , a new branch ( upper branch ) of many - body solution emerges .",
    "interestingly , a quantum phase transition can also be identified in this upper branch .    in fig .",
    "[ abgfug ] ( a - c ) we show the results of the order parameter , the shifted chemical potential , and the molecular fraction as functions of detuning for the upper branch . here",

    "[ abgfug ] ( d - f ) , we show the same quantities for the lower branch .",
    "notice that there is no quantum phase transition in this branch , as the order parameter is always finite . for small soc ,",
    "the shifted chemical potential is positive in the bcs - limit , indicating the existence of a fermi surface .",
    "hence , the system in the lower branch undergoes a bcs - bec crossover as the interaction becomes stronger or as the soc strength increases .",
    "in previous sections , we see that the quantum phase transition in the upper branch is intimately connected with the soc . for positive background scattering length , soc can modify the location of the phase transition point , while for negative background scattering length , soc can induce a new quantum phase transition . in this section , we discuss in detail the dependence of the phase transition point on various parameters .",
    "the condition for the onset of this quantum phase transition can in fact be obtained analytically by examining the gap and the number equations ( [ equf ] ) . at the critical detuning where the quantum phase transition occurs , we have @xmath72 . for the upper branch , regardless of the sign of the background scattering length ,",
    "this is only possible when the right - hand - side of the gap equation also tends to infinity as the quantum critical point is approached .",
    "therefore , at the critical point , the denominator of the left - hand - side of the gap equation must vanish , leading to @xmath73 here , @xmath74 is the critical detuning of the quantum phase transition point in the upper branch .",
    "similarly , the number equation at the critical point takes the form @xmath75 where @xmath76 . from these equations",
    ", we see that soc only affects the quantum critical point through the chemical potential @xmath77 .     for the quantum phase transition in the upper branch as functions of @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",

    ", the critical detuning can be made to cross the resonance point when either the resonance width or the soc strength is tuned [ see fig . [ qpt](a ) and [ qpt](c ) ] . for systems with negative background scattering length , however",
    ", the critical point is always lying on the bec side of the feshbach resonance in any realistic situation . by choosing a narrow resonance with small soc strength ,",
    "this quantum phase transition can be tuned closer to the resonance points , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ qpt](b ) and [ qpt](d ) .",
    "this observation suggests that for the experimental observation of this quantum phase transition , a system with narrow feshbach resonance under moderate soc strength should be preferred .",
    "we have studied a spin - orbit coupled ultracold fermi gas near a feshbach resonance by using a two - channel model . we find that under a finite soc and with a finite background scattering length , there are in general two branches of solution for both the two - body and the many - body ground states .",

    "these lead to the interesting situation that a quantum phase transition exists in the upper branch of the many - body solution .",
