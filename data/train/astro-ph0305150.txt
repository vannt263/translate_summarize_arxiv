    "x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies revealed the presence of large amounts of iron @xcite and other heavy elements @xcite in the intracluster medium ( icm ) .",
    "supernova - driven galactic winds , which were first considered in detail by @xcite , are now widely believed to be the origin of icm enrichment .",
    "based on this hypothesis , several constraints on contributions of various galaxies to the icm enrichment and on the past supernova ( sn ) activities in the galaxies were obtained by comparing observations with theoretical expectations .",
    "the mass of icm , which is proportional to the iron mass , highly correlates with the luminosity from ellipticals and lenticulars and its correlation with that of spirals is poor @xcite .",
    "this indicates that only ellipticals and lenticulars have participated in the iron enrichment of the icm . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite argued that the observed iron mass - to - light ratio can not be explained unless the past average rate of type ia supernova was at least a factor of @xmath1 10 higher than the present rate in ellipticals , or massive stars in clusters formed with a very flat initial mass function .",
    "a similar conclusion was obtained by comparing the total observed amounts of not only iron , but also oxygen and silicon with calculated yields from type ii supernovae @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the @xmath0-dependence of the iron abundance in clusters of galaxies , and found little or no evolution of it out to @xmath2 0.5 . by combining this with a passive evolution of elliptical galaxies known at least up to @xmath2 0.3  0.4 ,",
    "most of the iron enrichment should have occurred at @xmath3 1 .",
    "@xcite proposed a detailed model for bimodal star formation in elliptical galaxies and the enrichment of the icm , that is , at least , consistent with the above constraints from the observations . in this model , it is considered that about 10@xmath4 type ii supernovae occurred during the initial star - formation burst for about 10@xmath5 years in proto elliptical galaxies at around @xmath2 5  10 , and that most of iron was produced then .    if this very high rate of sn ii explosions really happened in proto elliptical galaxies at a very early stage of the universe , trials to obtain its observational evidences should be very important . in this paper",
    ", we present an interesting possibility to find them with x - ray observations .    advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ( asca : @xcite ) found a firm evidence of presence of very high energy electrons in supernova remnants ( snrs ) from sn 1006 @xcite .",
    "it was further confirmed by a detection of tev @xmath6-rays from sn 1006 with the cangaroo cerenkov light telescope @xcite .",
    "the tev @xmath6-rays are well explained as the inverse - compton scattering of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) by the same high energy electrons as are responsible for the synchrotron emission in the radio and x - ray bands . in relation to the origin of the cosmic - ray particles ,",
    "such a presence of high - energy particles as in sn 1006 would be common to every snr .",
    "if so , we would expect an enhancement of the inverse - compton emission of the cmb from an snr at an early epoch of the universe because of the ( 1@xmath7 dependence of the cmb flux on the cosmological redshift factor @xmath0 .",
    "the importance of the inverse - compton emission of the cmb in the early universe has been pointed out by @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we consider the detection possibility of the inverse - compton emission of the cmb from type ii snrs in star - formation - bursting proto - elliptical galaxies in the early universe .",
    "let us consider the case that a hot plasma with thermal energy , @xmath8 , was produced through shock , and that a fraction , @xmath9 , of @xmath8 was transferred to the total energy of non - thermal protons , @xmath10 : @xmath11 when the distribution functions in terms of the lorentz factor , @xmath6 , of the non - thermal protons and electrons in @xmath12 are expressed as @xmath13 and @xmath14 , respectively , the two normalization factors are related to each other as @xmath15 , according to @xcite , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the electron and proton mass , respectively .",
    "thus , the normalization factor of the electron distribution , @xmath18 , can be given with the help of equation ( 1 ) as @xmath19,\\ ] ] for @xmath20 , since @xmath21 .",
    "here , @xmath22 is the velocity of light .    in an snr",
    ", these non - thermal electrons will collide with the cmb photons , and radiate inverse - compton emission .",
    "since the photon energy , @xmath23 , after a collision of a cmb photon with an average energy , @xmath24 , with an electron with @xmath6 is approximated as @xmath25 electrons with @xmath26 are responsible for x - ray emission . here , @xmath27 is the boltzman constant and @xmath28 is the blackbody temperature of the cmb .",
    "these electrons will lose their energy mainly through ionization loss , and their life , @xmath29 is roughly given as ( for the ionization loss rate , see e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the number density of ambient matter .",
    "hence , their life is expected to be 10@xmath32 years at shortest in an interstellar medium .",
    "the electrons will also lose their energy through inverse - compton emission , and the life time of the electrons in a universe at @xmath0 for the inverse - compton emission of the cmb photons is given as @xmath33 the lifetime of electrons with @xmath26 for the inverse - compton emission is longer than 10@xmath32 years unless the electrons exist in a universe at @xmath0 close to 10 .",
    "thus , we assume the lifetime of electrons responsible for the inverse - compton emission in the x - ray band to be 10@xmath32 years hereafter .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of the inverse - compton emission from a snr with an age less than 10@xmath32 years is given as ( see equation 7.31 in @xcite ) @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the classical electron radius and the planck constant respectively , and @xmath37 is given as in rybicki and lightman ( ) .",
    "thus , the x - ray luminosity of the inverse - compton emission in an energy range between @xmath38 and @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 , \\ ] ] for @xmath20 .",
    "if we assume @xmath41 erg , @xmath42 k , @xmath20 , and ln(@xmath43 ) = 10 , the 1  10 kev luminosity is estimated as @xmath44 the inverse - compton emission was really detected from sn 1006 by a tev @xmath6-ray observation with the cangaroo cerenkov light telescope @xcite , although the synchrotron emission is dominant over the inverse - compton emission in the x - ray band @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed a joint spectral analysis of rxte - pca , asca - sis , and rosat - pspc data of sn 1006 , and obtained @xmath45 erg s@xmath46 , @xmath47 , and ln(@xmath48 .",
    "these values are all consistent with those expected from general arguments on galactic cosmic - ray acceleration ( see discussion in @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let us consider how an x - ray flux of the inverse - compton emission from a snr evolves with the cosmic redshift factor , @xmath0 . since @xmath49 and @xmath50 , a flux of the inverse - compton emission in an energy range between @xmath38 and @xmath39 detected from a snr at @xmath0 , @xmath51 , is given as @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the luminosity distance .    here , we compare this @xmath0-dependence with that of the synchrotron emission in the same x - ray band from the same electrons in the snr .",
    "an x - ray spectrum of the synchrotron emission is @xmath54 in an energy range , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the turn - over energy corresponding to a turn - over lorentz factor , @xmath57 , above which the slope of the electron distribution becomes @xmath58 .",
    "@xmath6 of electrons responsible for the synchrotron emission in the x - ray band is as large as @xmath59 , while @xmath57 in 10@xmath32 years is calculated to be @xmath60 from equation 5 on an assumption that the main energy loss of the high - energy electrons is due to inverse - compton emission .",
    "since @xmath61 , the ratio of the flux of the inverse - compton emission to that of the synchrotron emission is proportional to @xmath62 for @xmath20 . hence , the inverse - compton emission should be dominant over the synchrotron emission in the x - ray observations of relics of star - burst activities in distant galaxies .    the integrated flux from a proto - elliptical galaxy at @xmath0 is expected to be @xmath63 here",
    ", @xmath64 is the average life of non - thermal electrons responsible for inverse - compton x - ray emission , and is assumed to be 10@xmath32 years . @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the total sn - number in a star - formation burst and the duration of the star - formation burst .",
    "they are roughly 10@xmath4 and 10@xmath5 years , respectively , as in @xcite .",
    "a result of calculations of equation ( 10 ) for @xmath67 erg s@xmath46 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 yr and @xmath70 yr , is shown in figure 1 as a function of @xmath0 . in these calculations ,",
    "@xmath7170 km s@xmath46mpc@xmath46 are assumed .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the observed flux is expected to rather increase as @xmath0 increases beyond unity .",
    "this is simply due to an increase of the cmb flux in association with a @xmath0-increase .",
    "as can be seen in figure 1 , the expected flux in 1  10 kev can exceed @xmath72 erg @xmath73 s@xmath46 at @xmath74 . if the parameters adopted above are really adequate , such an initial star - burst activity in proto elliptical galaxies could be detectable in a 10@xmath75 s observation with a large x - ray telescope with a photon collecting area of several 10@xmath75 @xmath76 , such as intended in the xeus mission @xcite .",
    "such a large telescope could be realized in fairly near future .",
    "according to results from optical deep survey observations ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the number of galaxies with @xmath77 is about 10@xmath78 deg@xmath79 .",
    "even if such a distant galaxy has a violent star formation burst ( sfb ) with a period of 10@xmath5 years as discussed above , a chance to hit the sfb in a galaxy will be only @xmath1 1% .",
    "hence , if a fraction , of the order of 10% , of the galaxies experience the violent sfbs , we could be able to detect the inverse - compton x - rays from a number , of the order of 10 , of star - bursting galaxies in a deg@xmath80 field .",
    "such an x - ray source would have the spectrum of a power law with a photon index of around 1.5 .",
    "although this spectrum is similar to that of agns , the star - burst activity in a proto galaxy could have a spatial extension of several ten kpc .",
    "if so , these sources should be detected as sources with an extension of several arc seconds , and hence be distinguishable from agns .",
    "even if we detect star - bursting proto galaxies , it might be difficult to determine their distances .",
    "one possibility to do it could be redshift determination of nuclear @xmath6-ray lines from the sn ejectas .    in a type ii sn",
    ", an fe@xmath81 atom is produced through a process , ni@xmath81  co@xmath81 ",
    "fe@xmath81 , and a co@xmath81 emits a 1.2 mev or 0.85 mev line in decaying with a time constant of 111 days .",
    "these nuclear lines are down - scattered by ambient cool electrons and are fully absorbed by the ambient matter at the initial phase of a sn explosion . however , as the ejecta expands , the ambient matter gradually becomes transparent for @xmath6-ray lines in one or two years . at this stage ,",
    "@xmath6-ray lines from co@xmath82 , 122 kev or 136 kev in a sequence , ni@xmath82co@xmath82fe@xmath82 , are considered to be more detectable than those from co@xmath81 .",
    "the amount of fe@xmath82 is only @xmath83 of that of fe@xmath81 but the time constant of the co@xmath82 decay to @xmath84 is as long as 391 days .",
    "since this decay time is comparable to the time scale for the ejecta to become transparent , about 10% of the 122 kev or 136 kev lines emerges without any interaction with the ambient matter ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .    the expected co@xmath82 line ( a total of 122 kev lines and 136 kev lines ) flux can be estimated as @xmath85 where @xmath86 are a probability for a co@xmath82 line to be directly detected , the abundance ratio of fe@xmath82 to fe@xmath81 , the total iron mass produced in a star - formation burst , and the mass of an iron atom , respectively .",
    "the co@xmath82 line flux was calculated from equation ( 11 ) based on assumptions of the following parameter values , @xmath87 ( from @xcite ) ; @xmath88 @xcite ; @xmath89 ( from @xcite ) , as a function of @xmath0 .",
    "the estimated photon flux of the co@xmath82 lines from proto elliptical galaxies is about 2  6 @xmath90 photons @xmath73 s@xmath46 for sources at @xmath2 510 .",
    "this is far below the detection limit of such large telescopes having a photon collecting area as large as 10@xmath78 @xmath76 in 10  20 kev ( the co@xmath82 lines will appear in this range for sources with @xmath91 510 ) .",
    "however , after picking up a sufficient number of serendipitous , slightly extended sources with agn - like spectra , possible candidates of star - bursting proto elliptical galaxies , we might be able to sum up all of those spectra and to see the @xmath0-distribution of the co@xmath82 lines .",
