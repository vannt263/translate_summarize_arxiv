    "the flow of complex fluids near interfaces is governed by a subtle interplay between the fast microscopic dynamics within a small localised region of the system close to the interface and the slow dynamics in the bulk fluid region .",
    "this scenario is encountered in a wide variety of applications ranging from nanotechnology ( nanofluidics ) and other industrial processes ( such as wetting , droplet formation , critical fluids near heated surfaces or crystal growth from a fluid phase ) to biological systems ( for example , membranes or biomolecules near interfaces ) .",
    "the dynamics of these systems depends on the intimate connection of many different spatio - temporal scales : from the nanoscale to the microscale and beyond .",
    "realistic simulations of such systems via standard classical molecular dynamics ( md ) are prohibitive , while continuum fluid dynamics ( cfd ) can not describe the important details within the interfacial region . in view of this fact",
    ", the field of computer simulation is now faced with the need for new techniques , which bridge a wider range of time and length scales with the minimum loss of information .",
    "a hybrid particle - continuum approach provides a resolution to this dilemma .",
    "a hybrid algorithm retains all the atomistic detail within the relevant localized domain and couples this region to the continuum hydrodynamic description of the remainder of the system .",
    "indeed hybrid algorithms for liquids can be expected to provide a powerful tool for the fast growing field of nanofluidics in micro electro - mechanical systems ( mems ) and our ongoing contributions have been recognized by the nanoscience community ( r. delgado - buscalioni and coveney 2003a ) as offering a promising simulation technique with nanotechnological applications .",
    "hybrid algorithms for solids ( abraham _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and gases ( garcia _ et al _ 1999 ) were the first to be fully developed in the literature .",
    "as expected in most theoretical descriptions of matter , the hybrid description of the liquid state is the most challenging one .",
    "the general procedure is to connect the particle domain ( p ) and the continuum domain ( c ) within an overlapping region comprised of two buffers : c@xmath0p and p@xmath0c ( see figure 1 ) . within the p@xmath0c buffer",
    "the particle dynamics are coarse - grained to extract the boundary conditions for the c - region .",
    "the most complicated part of any hybrid scheme is the c@xmath0p coupling where the microscopic dynamics need to be reconstructed to adhere to the prescriptions given by the continuum variables .",
    "moreover , in doing so the unphysical artifacts thereby introduced should be minimized ( following occam s razor ) .    in this paper",
    "we provide an overview of the state - of - the - art of the hybrid modelling of liquids . in  [ s - o ] we start by presenting an overview of the hybrid scheme and some preliminary topics such as the inherent constraints on the continuum time step and the spatial - grid size .",
    "section [ t - c ] discusses several implementations of the temporal - coupling .",
    "the c@xmath0p coupling scheme is then explained in  [ s - cp ] for the general case of mass , momentum and energy .",
    "we illustrate this important part of the scheme by reproducing the three hydrodynamic modes ( shear , sound and heat ) governing the relaxing flows in an infinite medium .",
    "section [ s - pc ] is devoted to the p@xmath0c coupling , based on a finite volume method solving the flow within the c domain .",
    "some comments on the effect of noise on the accuracy of the scheme are made .",
    "the full method is used in  [ osc ] to solve the problem of shear flow driven by oscillatory wall motion in a nano - slot .",
    "finally , conclusions and future directions for this research are described in  [ cn ] .",
    "the domain decomposition deployed in our hybrid scheme is depicted in figure 1 . within domain",
    "p the fluid is described at the atomistic level via newtonian dynamics .",
    "the position of the @xmath1 atoms at time @xmath2 inside p is updated each @xmath3 time interval using a standard md scheme .",
    "the present calculations were done with a lennard - jones ( lj ) fluid . throughout the ongoing discussion",
    "all quantities are given in reduced lennard jones units : length @xmath4 , mass @xmath5 , energy @xmath6 , time @xmath7 and temperature @xmath8 .",
    "we refer to hoheisel 1996 , for the estimated physical values of the lj parameters for several substances ( as an example , for a simple molecular fluid as n2 , @xmath9 nm and @xmath10k ) .",
    "the rest of the computational domain ( c ) is described by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "the fluid variables at c are the densities of the conserved quantities for which the equations of motion in conservative form are @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 standing for the mass , momentum and energy fluxes respectively . here",
    "@xmath14 is the density , @xmath15 the local velocity , @xmath16 the specific energy , @xmath17 the stress tensor which contains the pressure @xmath18 and the viscous tensor @xmath19 ( for a newtonian fluid ) and @xmath20 , the heat flux by conduction expressed via fourier s law .",
    "these continuum equations may be solved via standard cfd methods .",
    "alternatively , for low - reynolds number flows ( @xmath21 ) the equations can be solved analytically ( delgado - buscalioni & coveney 2003b ) , as is done in the tests presented in ",
    "[ s - cp ] .",
    "the kind of information to be transferred in the overlapping region has been the subject of some discussion .",
    "the first attempts in the literature ( delgado - buscalioni & coveney 2003b and references therein ) considered the transfer of momentum in steady shear flows and proposed a matching procedure based on the continuity of velocity across the overlapping region .",
    "this sort of coupling strategy may be referred to as `` coupling - through - state '' .",
    "an alternative formulation of the information exchange for liquids based on matching the fluxes of conserved quantities ( to / from p and c ) was proposed by flekky _",
    "these authors considered steady shear flows with mass transfer . in subsequent work by delgado - buscalioni & coveney ( 2003b )",
    "the flux - coupling scheme was generalized to enable transfer of mass , energy and momentum ( along both transversal and longitudinal directions ) .",
    "delgado - buscalioni & coveney 2003b also present a comparative study of the coupling - through - fluxes and coupling - through - state schemes for flows involving energy transfer ( longitudinal waves ) .",
    "it was shown that the coupling - through - fluxes scheme provides the correct physical behaviour , while the coupling - through - state scheme does not guarantee positive entropy production .",
    "consequently the coupling of fluxes is of central importance in our hybrid scheme ( see  [ s - cp ] and  [ s - pc ] ) .",
    "in general there are three times involved in the coupling scheme : the md time - step @xmath3 , the time - step for the c - solver @xmath22 and the averaging time @xmath23 , which are presented below as outline two possible strategies for merging the time - evolution of c and p. the information transfer ( from c@xmath0p and p@xmath0c ) is updated over each time interval , @xmath24 . as stated above , the p@xmath0c coupling consists firstly of a coarse - graining procedure .",
    "in particular , for any particulate quantity , @xmath25 , the spatial average over each p@xmath0c cell of volume @xmath26 ( @xmath27 , in figure 1 ) is defined as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the position of the cell in the coarse - grained coordinates and @xmath30 is the number of particles inside @xmath26 .",
    "the time average also needs to be local with respect to the coarse - grained dynamics . to that end",
    ", the microscopic quantities are sampled over a time interval @xmath23 which is treated as an independent parameter of the simulation : @xmath31 the magnitudes @xmath24 and @xmath23 are constrained by several physical and numerical prerequisites quoted in table 1 .",
    ".constrains on the coarse grained time and length scales within our hybrid md - cfd scheme .",
    "condition c.1 ensures the local thermodynamical equilibrium at the averaging region : the coarse - graining time @xmath23 and grid - spacing @xmath32 needs to be larger than the collision time @xmath33 and the mean free path @xmath34 , respectively . in c.1 @xmath33 and @xmath34",
    "are estimated by the hard - sphere approximation .",
    "condition c.2 is needed to resolve the fastest flow characteristic time @xmath35 and the spatial variation of any physical variable @xmath36 over the control cell @xmath37 .",
    "depending on the flow behaviour , in c.2 , @xmath35 may stand for the period of the oscillatory flow @xmath38 or for the diffusive time @xmath39 , etc .",
    "the accuracy condition in eq.(c.3 ) ensures that the signal - to - noise ratio of the transversal momentum flux in a flow with shear rate @xmath40 is greater than one ( similar kind of relationships can be derived for the longitudinal momentum and energy fluxes ) .",
    "the conditions c.1 , c.2 and c.3 are applied within the p@xmath0c cell .",
    "the last condition , c.4 , ensures the stability of the numerical ( explicit ) scheme used for time - integration of the c flow .",
    "the characteristic velocity of the flow ( on one grid space ) is denoted by @xmath41 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the decay of transversal and longitudinal waves is an excellent test for the validity of our proposed the c@xmath0p coupling as they comprise the whole set of hydrodynamic modes : shear , sound and heat waves . for these tests we implemented a set - up consisting of a p region of length @xmath42 ( with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath43 and @xmath44 directions ) surrounded by two c domains .",
    "we initially imposed on the p system a sinusoidal ( x- or y- ) velocity profile along the x direction . by extracting the initial amplitudes of the spatial fourier components of all the hydrodynamic quantities",
    "it is then possible to trace the entire time - evolution of the relaxing flow using linear hydrodynamics . in particular , this permits us to calculate at any time the generalized forces to be inserted within the c@xmath0p cell .",
    "the time evolution of the spatial fourier components of the p - variables is finally compared with the analytical expressions .",
    "such kinds of comparisons are shown in figures 3 and 4 , for the case of a relaxing shear wave and a longitudinal wave , respectively .",
    "the excellent agreement obtained indicates that the c@xmath0p coupling protocol can be used for capturing fast and low - amplitude flows , such as those governed by sound , shear or heat waves .    the entropy perturbation , shown in fig .",
    "5 , was calculated from the temperature and density perturbative field .",
    "the results clearly show that using only one thermostat per c@xmath0p cell ( denoted by 1-nht@xmath45 , in figs .",
    "3 and 4 ) leads to negative entropy production . the pure exponential decay of heat due to diffusion is only recovered when the correct ( averaged ) heat flux is connected to each c@xmath0p cell ; in figs . 4 and 5 we present a result with two thermostats per cell ( 2-nht@xmath45 ) .",
    "this result confirms that the coupling - through - fluxes scheme is the correct matching procedure .",
    "within the p@xmath0c cells the information coming from the particle dynamics is coarse - grained to provide boundary conditions at the `` upper '' c - level . in  [ s - o ] we introduced the averages needed to produce such information . at the p@xmath0c interface the c region receives the averaged particle - fluxes as open - flux ( von neumann ) boundary conditions .",
    "the averaged mass , momentum and energy particle - fluxes through the p@xmath0c interface are constructed as follows , @xmath46 where @xmath30 is the number of particles inside the p@xmath0c cell of volume @xmath26 and @xmath47 is the surface vector shown in fig . 1 .",
    "let us now illustrate how these fluxes can be injected into the c domain in the framework of the finite volumes method ( patankar 1980 ) .",
    "the finite volumes method is ideally suited to our scheme because it exactly balances the fluxes across the computational cells .",
    "its principle is simple .",
    "briefly , the computational domain ( c ) is divided into cells of volume @xmath48 whose size and location is given by the nodes of a specified mesh , @xmath49 , @xmath50 . integrating the conservation equation @xmath51 over each computational cell ( say the cell @xmath52 in fig .",
    "1 ) one obtains,@xmath53 where @xmath54 stands for the area of the face @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the outwards normal surface vector .",
    "the volume integral of the transient term of the conservation equation has been approximated by @xmath57 times the explicit time derivative of the value of the integrand at the cell centre , halfway between the surfaces : @xmath58 .",
    "equation ( [ int.vol ] ) yields a set of ordinary differential equations ( ode s ) involving the flow variables at each cell face , @xmath55 .",
    "the set of equations is closed for the flow variables at the cell centre by expressing the fluxes at the interfaces @xmath59 in terms of differences of flow variables at neighbouring cell centres , via the constitutive relations .",
    "let us consider the momentum flux balance for the low reynolds number flow of an incompressible and isothermal fluid driven by diffusion of @xmath43-velocity along @xmath60 direction : @xmath61 .",
    "in this case @xmath62 , where the surface vector of the p@xmath0c surface is @xmath63 .",
    "let us consider an isobaric environment and restrict ourselves to the transfer of transversal ( @xmath43 ) momentum , governed by the momentum flux @xmath64 and the shear rate @xmath65 .",
    "integrating along the cell @xmath52 ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , using a first order space discretisation of the stress ( e.g. @xmath66 ) and an explicit time integration scheme , one obtains @xmath67 where the subscripts @xmath52 denote the set of cell centres @xmath68 , and the symbols @xmath69 ( east ) and @xmath70 ( west ) denote variables measured : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the time instant is denoted by @xmath73 and @xmath74 and @xmath75 . with @xmath76 the kinematic viscosity . in order to guarantee the numerical stability of the explicit scheme in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) , the size of the ( smallest ) control cell inside the c region @xmath32 and the time step @xmath77 are related through @xmath78 , which corresponds to the grid - diffusive - velocity @xmath79 in the courant condition c.4 of table 1 . in solving eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) we used a uniform grid with a typical value of @xmath80 .    in order to impose the boundary condition one needs to determine the velocity within the outer cells : at the rightmost @xmath81 and at the leftmost boundary ( inside the p@xmath0c cell , see fig .",
    "1 ) @xmath82 . at @xmath83",
    "there is a rigid wall which moves at a velocity @xmath84 and provides the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath85 .",
    "the hybrid formulation is applied at the left boundary @xmath86 . to evaluate the outer velocity @xmath87 we impose the balance of momentum flux across the @xmath88 surface at @xmath89 .",
    "this means that the continuum flux evaluated at @xmath90 is made equal to the corresponding averaged particle flux @xmath91 .",
    "the outer velocity to be inserted in eq .",
    "( [ exp ] ) is then @xmath92 . the velocity @xmath93 is evaluated as a linear combination of the continuum @xmath94 and the average particle velocity @xmath95 at @xmath96 : @xmath97 by inserting eq .",

    "( [ exp ] ) one obtains the velocity at the boundary cell @xmath98 the reason for the choice of @xmath93 in eq .",
    "( [ upb ] ) now becomes clear .",
    "it introduces the last term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) which acts as a forcing term ensuring velocity continuity by gently driving the continuum velocity to the corresponding particle average @xmath99 .",
    "the strength of the _ velocity coupling _ is maximal when @xmath100 and is absent if @xmath101 .",
    "the idea of using a hybrid gradient ( arising for any @xmath102 in eq .",
    "( [ upb ] ) ) arose from the outcome of calculations performed at very low shear rates ( @xmath103 ) . using @xmath104",
    "one obtains a velocity discontinuity at p@xmath0c which is of the same order of magnitude as the fluctuations of the mean instantaneous velocity within the overlapping region . at low shear rates this means substantial relative differences in the c and p velocities , @xmath105",
    "this problem is solved by introducing a small velocity coupling in the continuum scheme , with a small value of @xmath106 $ ] , which drives the continuum velocity to the average particle velocity in a time of @xmath107 $ ] . to check any influence of the velocity coupling term in eq .",
    "( [ up ] ) on the flux balance , we performed simulations of the couette flow at different shear rates and compared its average over time with the time averaged momentum particle flux .",
    "the results showed that , in average , the velocity coupling term is vanishingly small so it does not introduce any extra flux in the coarse - grained time scale .      in our scheme ,",
    "the fluctuating nature of the fluxes introduced into the c region at p@xmath108c imposes a limitation on our ability to resolve the flow field , as also arises in experiments and full md simulations .",
    "this limit is determined by signal - to - noise ratio becoming smaller than one .",
    "a theoretical expression for the amplitude of the stress fluctuations can be obtained ( delgado - buscalioni _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ) , providing a relationship between the signal - to - noise ratio and the coarse - grained time and space scales @xmath23 and @xmath26 .",
    "table 1 contains the condition to ensure an averaged shear force larger than its variance .",
    "it is clear that in weak steady flows it is always possible to increase the signal - to - noise ratio by enlarging @xmath23 .",
    "nevertheless , in a general space and time - dependent flow , the sizes of the averaging windows in space and time ( @xmath26 and @xmath23 ) are bounded above by the minimum wavelength and characteristic time which need to be treated within the flow .",
    "such requirements on spatial and temporal flow resolution are also quoted in table 1 .",
    "in order to test the applicability of the full hybrid scheme under unsteady flows , we have considered the flow of an incompressible and isothermal fluid between two parallel walls in relative oscillatory motion .",
    "this set - up is widely used to investigate the reological properties of complex fluids attached to surfaces , as polymer brushes ( see c.m .",
    "wijmans & b. smit ( 2002 ) for a recent review ) .",
    "these systems are good examples of the sort of applications of the hybrid scheme , which can treat the complex fluid region by md and the momentum transfer from the bulk by cfd .",
    "a similar set - up can be also used in the simualation of nanotechnological process .",
    "for instance , stroock _ et al . _",
    "( 2002 ) showed that the mixing of solutions in low reynolds number flows in microchannels can be enhanced by introducing bas - relief nano - structures on the floor of the slot . in our test flow ,",
    "the simulation domain is @xmath109 and it is periodic along @xmath43 and @xmath44 directions .",
    "the particle domain occupies the region @xmath110 , and it includes the lj liquid and the atomistic wall composed of two layers lj particles at @xmath111 .",
    "the continuum domain comprises the region @xmath112 $ ] .",
    "the sizes of the simulation domains were within the nanoscale @xmath113 , and @xmath114 , while the width of the overlapping region , @xmath115 , was set to arround @xmath116 . the flow is uniquely driven by the oscillatory motion of the @xmath117 wall along the @xmath43 direction , meaning that the mean pressure is constant throughout the domain and there are no transfers of mean energy or mass in the @xmath60 direction ( perpendicular to the p@xmath0c surface ) .",
    "therefore the mean flow carries transversal momentum by diffusion only , and the equation of motion for the @xmath43-velocity is @xmath118 , with boundary conditions @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "this equation can be solved analytically ( h. schliting 1958 ; c.m .",
    "wijmans & b. smit 2002 ) .",
    "the flow profile has a maximum amplitude at the moving wall and the momentum introduced by its motion penetrates into a fluid layer of width @xmath121 . beyond this layer",
    "the flow amplitude tends to zero diffusively as it approaches the other wall held at rest .",
    "therefore , the maximum shear rate attained inside the momentum layer is of order @xmath122 . inserting this relation into the signal - to - noise condition ( c.3 in table 1 )",
    ", we find @xmath123 equation ( [ s3 ] ) means that in order to attain a signal - to - noise ratio larger than one , the mean kinetic energy per unit volume of the flow integrated over the averaging time @xmath23 needs to be larger than the corresponding energy due to fluctuations over the period of the mean flow .",
    "it is important to mention that at low enough frequencies ( @xmath124 ) , there is sufficient time for momentum to be spread by diffusion over the whole domain . in such situations",
    "the correct condition is given by the signal - to - noise condition ( c.3 in table 1 ) with @xmath125 .",
    "as indicated by condition c.2 in table 1 , in order to solve for the temporal variation of the flow it is required that @xmath126 . inserting this condition into eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) one obtains @xmath127 . for @xmath128 , @xmath129 and",
    "@xmath130 the above inequality yields @xmath131 .",
    "we performed oscillatory shear simulations for values of @xmath132 above , close to and below the threshold given by eq .",
    "( [ s3 ] ) . as shown in fig .",
    "6a , calculations made at large flow amplitudes are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution . in figure",
    "6b we present results for the same density and temperature ( @xmath129 and @xmath133 ) and a wall velocity @xmath134 right at the accuracy limit predicted by ( [ s3 ] ) . the averaging time was chosen to be @xmath135 .",
    "as shown by the instantaneous velocity within the p@xmath0c cell , the noise amplitude is nearly equal to the flow amplitude and its time - averaged value shows traces of fluctuations .",
    "figure 6c corresponds to the same velocity and density but at a larger temperature @xmath136 .",
    "this case is below the accuracy limit ( given by c.3 in table 1 ) where forces arising from thermal fluctuations dominate the hydrodynamic ones .",
    "we have presented a hybrid continuum - particle scheme for moderate - to - large fluid densities which takes into account mass , momentum and energy exchange between a domain described by discrete particle newtonian molecular dynamics ( p ) and an interfacing domain described by continuum fluid dynamics ( c ) .",
    "the coupling scheme is applied within an overlapping region comprised of two sub - cells where the two - way exchange of information is performed : c@xmath0p and p@xmath0c .",
    "we have shown that the coupling - through - variables scheme ( which simply ensures continuity of variables within the overlapping region ) is not sufficient to guarantee positive entropy production . however , by generalizing the coupling - through - fluxes scheme proposed by flekky _",
    "_ , 2000 to energy and mass transfer we find that the correct decay of shear , sound and heat waves is obtained .",
    "we are now deploying the present scheme to study the dynamics of a tethered polymer under shear flow .",
    "the polymer and its local environment are treated via md , while the shear flow imposed on the outer domain is treated via the finite volume cfd method . in the future , we plan to apply our hybrid scheme to the study of membrane dynamics .",
    "enhancements to the present hybrid algorithm are under investigation . in the scheme described here the energy flux balance is ensured only over time averages .",
    "we are currently studying alternative schemes which _ exactly _ balance this flux . from a numerical standpoint",
    ", we plan to implement the p@xmath0c coupling in conjunction with a finite volume cfd solver in 3d .",
    "also , the present scheme can be easily adapted to couple molecular dynamics with another mesoscopic scheme that takes into account hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "this sort of hybrid scheme could be used in applications where the fluctuations are relevant ( microfluidics , fluids near critical point , etc ... ) .",
    "an important condition for the interfacing mesoscopic scheme is that it needs to be fully consistent with thermodynamics . also important",
    "is that the transport coefficients of the mesoscopic model should be adjustable to represent the correct coarse - grained dynamics of the selected working fluid .",
    "natural candidates are the lagrangian schemes involving voronoi tesselation ( flekky _ et al . _",
    "2000a ) or the smooth particle dynamics model and related mesoscopic techniques ( espaol 2003 ) .",
    "the lattice boltzmann ( lb ) method is another possible candidate to interface with the md domain .",
    "this model has been already used in multiscale modelling ( succi _ et al _ 2001 ) . nevertheless , the problem with lb methods at present is that there is no truly reliable thermohydrodynamic model other than for single phase flow .",
    "energy conservation remains unsolved and most models are athermal ; even the thermohydrodynamic lattice - bgk models for the ideal gas are vastly over - determined and get the temperature dependence of the viscosity wrong ( boghosian and coveney 1998 ) .",
    "therefore the hybrid scheme proposed here could only be interfaced with the lattice boltzmann model in certain applications involving isothermal and incompressible single phase flows .",
    "a longer term goal of this research is to develop a flexible , componentized , hybrid coupling environment into which _ any _ molecular dynamics and _ any _ continuum fluid dynamics codes may be inserted .",
    "this will require consideration of electrostatic forces and , therefore , an additional conserved quantity , the electric charge , whose flux coupling will requires use of poisson - boltzmann solvers .",
    "moreover , such multiscale hybrid schemes are attractive candidates for efficient deployment on computational grids , a feature now under investigation with the realitygrid project ( www.realitygrid.org ) .",
