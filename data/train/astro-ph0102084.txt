    "x - ray observations of young rotation - powered pulsars offer a unique opportunity to resolve several fundamental questions about neutron stars and supernova remnants . studying the spectrum and morphology of the pulsar s synchrotron nebula ( or plerion ; weiler & panagia 1978 ) is crucial for determining basic properties about the relativistic pulsar wind and probing the density of the surrounding medium .",
    "measuring the temperature of the cooling surface of the pulsar provides a way to understand the thermal evolution of neutron stars and to constrain the equation of state . additionally , x - ray observations of pulsars are also important for searching for the remnant of the supernova that created the pulsar",
    ". direct studies of the remnant are useful for numerous reasons , including measurement of the elemental abundances and determination of the shock conditions in the supernova remnant ( snr ) through spectral analysis .",
    "associations between pulsars and snrs can provide independent distance and age estimates for both objects , and with a statistically significant sample of associations , constraints on the birth properties of neutron stars , including initial period , magnetic field , and velocity distribution , can be found .",

    "the _ asca _  x - ray telescope ( tanaka , inoue , & holt 1994 ) was used to observe psr  j1119@xmath06127  during a 36 hour period spanning 1999 august 1415 as part of the ao-7 guest observer program ( sequence number 57040000 ) . to achieve the time resolution necessary for pulsation searches , the gis ( gas imaging spectrometer )",

    "was operated in two - chip mode , providing an imaging area @xmath31 .",
    "the data were analyzed using the standard ( i.e. rev 2 ) screening criteria suggested in _ the asca data reduction guide . _",
    "the resulting effective exposure times are 37  ks ( gis ) and 34  ks ( sis ) .",
    "the _ rosat _  x - ray telescope ( trmper 1983 ) serendipitously observed the field around psr  j1119@xmath06127  with the position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) on 1996 august 14 during an 11-ks pointed observation of ngc  3603 ( sequence number rp900526n00 ) . after retrieving the data from the nasa - maintained heasarc archive , we used the already - processed and filtered data for our subsequent analysis . in the observation , psr  j1119@xmath06127  is located 31  away from the optical axis , and due to vignetting and obscuration from the mirror support structure , the effective exposure time for a 15  diameter circle centered on the pulsar is between 6.48.9  ks .",
    "flat - fielded images were generated by aligning and co - adding exposure - corrected images from pairs of instruments . as discussed by pivovaroff , kaspi & gotthelf ( 2000 ) ,",
    "great care must be taken ( particularly for the gis ) to remove detector artifacts ( e.g. , the window support grid ) and the diffuse x - ray background ( xrb ) .",
    "the software employed includes the recently released ftool  mkgisbgd . for a complete discussion of the steps taken to make this software compatible with this observation , see chapter 7 of pivovaroff ( 2000 ) .",
    "after rebinning the sis data by a factor of four ( 6@xmath3273  pixel@xmath24 ) , data from both instruments were smoothed with a kernel representing the point spread function ( psf ) of the x - ray telescope ( xrt ) and detector combination .",
    "we approximate this function with a gaussian of @xmath33 for the sis and @xmath34 for the gis . finally , we correct the astrometric position of the smoothed images for known errors in the pointing solution using the ftool .",
    "x - ray events were filtered by energy to make images in three different bands : soft ( 0.83.0  kev ) , hard ( 3.010.0  kev ) , and broad ( 0.810.0  kev ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : j1119_asca ] shows gis images for all three band ( soft [ _ top left _ ] , hard [ _ bottom left _ ] , and broad [ _ top right _ ] ) .",
    "given the similarities between the two instruments , only the hard - band sis image is shown ( _ bottom right _ ) .",
    "in each plot , the radio position of psr  j1119@xmath06127  is marked by a cross .",
    "each plot also displays the contours from the recent 1.4-ghz atca radio observations of the field around the pulsar ( crawford et al .",
    "both instruments show significant emission from a nearly circular region that roughly matches the radio snr morphology . on the basis of this and other evidence presented below",
    ", we classify this extended emission as the previously unidentified x - ray - bright supernova remnant g292.2@xmath00.5 .",
    "the right ( western ) side of the snr exhibits marked enhancements in x - ray flux at energies below 3  kev , while at higher energies the emission is relatively uniform throughout the snr .",
    "in addition to the x - ray bright snr , the gis shows evidence for a hard point - like source in the middle of g292.2@xmath00.5 .",
    "following the procedure of pivovaroff , kaspi , and camilo ( 2000 ) , we estimate the significance of this detection by comparing the number of photons detected in a small aperture centered on the source with those from a concentric annulus used to estimate the local background . we calculate a significance of @xmath35 for the 158 background - subtracted photons detected with energies between 3.010.0  kev . to explore the possibility that the source is an instrumental artifact , we examined individual images from gis2 and gis3 .",
    "emission is present in both detectors at the above position , verifying the celestial nature of the source .",
    "no point - like source is seen in the hard - band sis image , although there is enhanced emission at the source position derived from the gis data .",
    "using aperture and annulus radii ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 , respectively ) appropriate for the smaller sis@xmath39xrt psf , we calculate a significance of @xmath40 for the 59 background - subtracted photons detected between 3.010.0  kev .",
    "the lack of a more significant point - like feature in the sis when one is present in the gis is not uncommon and probably results from the larger effective area of the gis at high energies ( gotthelf , priv .",
    "comm . ) .",
    "fitting a two - dimensional gaussian to the gis source distribution , we measure a position ( j2000 ) of @xmath41 , @xmath42  30with an uncertainty of @xmath110 .",
    "we classify this source as ax  j1119.1@xmath06128.5 .",
    "the absolute pointing uncertainty of the gis , after making the known corrections mentioned above , has an error radius of 24  at the 90% confidence level ( gotthelf et al .",
    "the source is located 87  away from psr  j1119@xmath06127 , more than twice the combined positional errors . however , we note that in at least one documented case , the _ asca_-measured position of a source was 80  from the well established position ( gotthelf et al",
    ". 2000a ) .",
    "thus , while the offset of the gis source from the pulsar is larger than expected , it does not preclude the possibility that the source is the x - ray counterpart of psr  j1119@xmath06127 , especially if other evidence supports the association .",
    "using standard software available from heasarc , we produced flat - fielded images with 15  pixels in the standard _",
    "rosat_soft ( @xmath43 kev ) and hard ( @xmath44 kev ) bands .",
    "the flat - fielded images were then smoothed with a gaussian kernel ( @xmath45 ) to approximate the psf of the telescope at the off - axis position of the pulsar .",
    "figure  [ fig : j1119_rosat ] shows the resultant images for the soft ( _ left _ ) and hard ( _ right _ ) bands .",
    "a cross marks the position of psr  j1119@xmath06127  and the contours are from the atca observations ( crawford et al .",
    "no emission from the snr is detected in the soft band .",
    "however , in the hard band , emission coincident with the western side of the radio shell is strongly detected .",
    "no x - rays are detected from the pulsar in either band .",
    "the morphology of the hard _ rosat _  band ( 0.52.0  kev ; fig .  [ fig : j1119_rosat ] [ _ right _ ] ) agrees well with that of the soft gis band ( 0.83.0  kev ; fig .",
    "[ fig : j1119_asca ] [ _ top left _ ] ) .",
    "the agreement between the two telescopes in principle offers the chance to check the absolute pointing of _",
    "asca_. due to its large fov ( 2  diameter ) and its soft - energy sensitivity , the pspc usually detects emission from several nearby stars in any given pointing .",
    "the positions of well resolved point sources were checked for optical counterparts using the simbad catalog .",
    "four bright stars were found , and the mean offset between the optical and x - ray positions was 18 .",
    "thus , we take the absolute position uncertainty of these pspc data to be 18 .",
    "next , we cross - correlated the morphology between the pspc and gis data .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath1arcminute spatial resolution of both images , combined with the different responses of both instruments , makes a detailed alignment check impossible .",
    "while an offset of more than @xmath11  between the _ asca _  and _ rosat_observations can be ruled out , this does not represent an improvement on the _ asca _  positional uncertainty of @xmath46 already discussed .",
    "pulsations from psr  j1119@xmath06127  were searched for by extracting gis events from a circular region centered on the position of ax  j1119.1@xmath06128.5 .",
    "after the arrival times were reduced to the barycenter using the ftool , the data were folded using 10 phase bins using the radio ephemeris corresponding to the mean mjd of the _ asca_observation .",
    "although the _ asca _  observation of psr  j1119@xmath06127  occurred very close to the time the pulsar glitched ( camilo et al . 2000 ) , given the small differences in the pre- and post - glitch values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 and the total time span of our observation , the glitch is irrelevant to our analysis .",

    "all resultant pulse profiles were searched for pulsations using both the @xmath63-test ( de jager 1994 ) and @xmath64 ( leahy et al . 1983 ) .",

    "these regions are shown in figure  [ fig : j1119_asca ] ( _ top right _ ) and figure  [ fig : j1119_rosat ] ( _ right _ ) .",
    "we also extracted a gis spectrum for the point source from a circular region with radius of @xmath68 .",
    "the data from gis-2 and gis-3 were kept separate , to avoid complications associated with summing them into a single spectrum .",
    "the psfs of both _ asca _  and _ rosat _  result in a contamination of the source flux with diffuse xrb .",
    "a background spectrum must therefore be subtracted from the data .",
    "ideally , the background should be taken from a nearby region that is source free and located at the same off - axis angle , which not only accounts for the xrb but for any local diffuse emission , always a possibility when looking in the galactic plane .",
    "while this task is trivial for the pspc and its 2  fov , the situation is more difficult for the gis . with more than 50% of the gis fov unoccupied by g292.2@xmath00.5",
    ", it might appear this region is appropriate for extracting a background .",
    "however , the scattering properties and broad wings of the xrt result in reflection properties that are strongly dependent on both incident energy and off - axis angle ( see , e.g. , gendreau 1995 ) . instead , we use another feature of the mkgisbgd ftool  to construct an accurate background .",
    "we again refer the interested reader to pivovaroff ( 2000 ) .",
    "our initial attempts at spectral fitting indicated that all five data sets could be described by a single model , as long as we allowed for different normalization values for each telescope and unique column densities ( @xmath69 ) for each side of the snr . in total , there were six free parameters : two values of @xmath69 , the spectral characterization ( e.g. , temperature for a plasma model ) , and three normalization values , two for the western side ( gis-2@xmath39gis-3 and pspc ) and one for the eastern side ( gis-2@xmath39gis-3 ) .",
    "the energy range fit is restricted to those bands where the signal is statistically significant : 0.42.0  kev ( pspc ) , 0.77.0  kev ( gis - western side ) , 0.78.0  kev ( gis - eastern side ) .",
    "data were then rebinned such that each background - subtracted energy bin had a minimum of 20 counts , allowing us to use the @xmath64 statistic as our goodness - of - fit estimator .",

    "attempts to improve the fit by addition of a second spectral component do not work for two reasons .",
    "first , while some of the excess residuals appear to be emission - like features , there are no known lines at these energies .",
    "second , although the approximately 1000 counts in each gis spectrum and the 500 counts in the pspc spectrum allow a fairly tight constraint on a single model , there is not sufficient data to fit a combination of two models .",

    "one of the main arguments supporting the interpretation of the extended x - ray emission as a snr is its correlation with the morphology of the radio shell , recently shown to have radio spectral properties consistent with those of other known snrs ( crawford et al .",
    "the presence of psr  j1119@xmath06127  at the center of the radio and x - ray emission strengthens this reasoning and provides a way to test the consistency of the claimed association .",

    "the dm of psr  j1119@xmath06127implies a distance of more than 30  kpc , well outside the galaxy .",
    "this implausibly large value is easily understood , as the galactic longitude of psr  j1119@xmath06127  ( @xmath87 ) is nearly tangential to the carina spiral arm , intersecting it at distances of 2.4 and 8.0  kpc .",
    "the best explanation for the large dm is that there is clumping of dense , dispersive material in the direction of the pulsar .",
    "the taylor & cordes model , which lacks fine structure ( i.e. small - scale clumps ) , likely underestimates the electron density and hence overestimate the distance for this line - of - sight .",
    "a reasonable upper limit on the distance can be obtained by assuming that psr  j1119@xmath06127  lies no further than the second intersection point , or 8  kpc .",
    "we also note that in this direction , the edge of the galaxy only extends @xmath110  kpc from the sun ( georgelin & georgelin 1976 ; taylor & cordes 1993 ) , resulting in a maximum error on the distance upper limit of 25% .",

    "we adopt an angular size of @xmath88 )  to encompass both measurements .",
    "taken with the age and distance estimates , we calculate a mean expansion velocity of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the distance to the pulsar parameterized in units of 5  kpc .",
    "this velocity is consistent with that of a 1700-yr - old snr still evolving in the free expansion phase .",
    "it implies a kinetic energy for the initial explosion of @xmath91 , where @xmath92 is the explosion energy in units of @xmath93 ergs and @xmath94 is the ejected mass in solar masses .",

    "thus , for either free or adiabatic expansion , the implied ratio @xmath106 is much greater than those found for most young galactic snrs ( see , e.g. , smith 1988 ) .",

    "this is intriguing as psr  j1119@xmath06127  and psr  b1509@xmath058 are very similar ( see  1 , table  1 ) ; it raises the possibility that their large magnetic fields are related to a common evolutionary scenario .",

( 1999 ) suggest that the progenitor of psr  b1509@xmath058 was a massive star that later evolved into a helium star before it underwent a supernova .        in principle , one of the most surprising aspects of the spectrum is the lack of obvious line features commonly seen in young snrs like cas  a ( e.g. , hughes et al .",

    "however , from the mekal fits , it is clear that after the line - rich spectra are folded through the gis response , the only lines that should be visible are possibly the fe k species around 6.7  kev .",

    "typically , even young remnants with ages less than 1000  yr have temperatures closer to 2  kev ( koyama et al .",
    "1996 ; sakano et al .",
    "one plausible explanation for this is the use of a simple plasma model assuming solar elemental abundances . in most cases , snr spectra with sufficiently high counting statistics ( a minimum of several thousand source counts ) or high energy resolution ( @xmath111 of several hundred , as in the case of the focal plane crystal spectrometer on _ einstein _ ) require non - solar abundances and at least one non - equilibrium ionization ( nei ) model to properly describe the data ( e.g. , hughes et al .",
    "2000 ; winkler et al .",
    "1981 ; hayashi et al . 1994 ) .",
    "while the lack of any obvious line features prevents us from attempting to fit more realistic models , we explored this possibility by adjusting the abundances of the three metals with the largest number densities relative to h , namely si , s , and fe .",
    "table  [ tab : j1119_abund ] lists the best - fit mekal temperatures obtained when the abundances have been multiplied by factors of 1.5 , 2.0 and 3.0 . as the amount of metals is increased , the temperature monotonically drops from @xmath58  kev to @xmath109  kev .",
    "the goodness of fit ( @xmath64 ) also grows , as do the systematic residuals , indicating that abundances factors of five to ten greater than solar are ruled out .",
    "however , it is quite realistic to expect that the use of a nei model in conjunction with modestly - enriched abundances would result in a goodness of fit comparable to that of the power - law or mekal model",
    ".    the spectral fitting we performed also allows the intriguing possibility that the emission from g292.2@xmath00.5  is non - thermal in origin .",
    "it is well - established that most young snrs have a strong non - thermal component ( see allen , gotthelf , & petre 1999 for a recent review ) . in the most commonly accepted scenario , electrons are accelerated by the remnant s shock wave to energies of @xmath11  tev and emit high - energy radiation via the synchrotron mechanism ( e.g. , reynolds 1998 ) .",
    "usually , though , thermal x - rays are also present in the snr .",
    "one notable exception is snr  g347.3@xmath00.5 , which shows no measurable thermal emission down to very low limits ( slane et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the photon index @xmath77 measured for g292.2@xmath00.5(@xmath47 ) agrees well with those in the range of values reported for different regions of g347.3@xmath00.5 ( 2.2 , 2.4 , and 2.4 ) .",
    "this spectrum is distinctly harder than those of snrs that exhibit both thermal and non - thermal emission , like cas  a ( @xmath112 ) , sn  1006 ( @xmath113 ) , kepler ( @xmath113 ) , tycho ( @xmath114 ) , and rcw  86 ( @xmath115 ) ( koyama et al . 1995 ; allen et al .",
    "1997 ; allen et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "although the spectral similarities support the idea that g292.2@xmath00.5may belong to a class of non - thermal remnants typified by g347.3@xmath00.5 , slane et al .",
    "( 1999 ) show that the properties of g347.3@xmath00.5 can reasonably be explained if the remnant is in a well - advanced sedov evolutionary phase and has an age between 1941  kyr .",
    "this is in contrast to g292.2@xmath00.5 , which is extremely young and is ( possibly ) just entering the sedov phase .",
    "ultimately , the nature of g292.2@xmath00.5 , be it a typical young thermal snr or a more exotic manifestation of the snr phenomenon , will only be decided with additional observations .",
    "another important aspect of the spectrum that requires explanation is the lack of soft x - rays from the eastern side of g292.2@xmath00.5  and the rather uniformly filled morphology at high energies ( compare figures  [ fig : j1119_asca ] and [ fig : j1119_rosat ] ) .",

    "dc  292.3@xmath00.4 appears to be located at a position capable of obscuring the eastern side of g292.2@xmath00.5 , and given that the cloud is certainly not spherical , it seems quite plausible that substructure ( e.g. , a finger or wisp ) extending across the snr absorbs the soft x - ray emission .",
    "= 8truecm    a more quantitative check is to see if the cloud can account for the difference in column densities ( @xmath116  @xmath71 ) between the two sides of the snr .",
    "the cloud s density ( class b ) roughly equals the lynds designation of opacity class ( oc ) 4 or 5 , which , using the calibrated relationship of feitzinger & stwe ( 1986 ) , @xmath117  mag , gives an extinction @xmath118 from dc  292.3@xmath00.4 .",
    "the corresponding column density @xmath69 can be estimated using @xmath119 , derived from @xmath120i)@xmath121  @xmath71  mag@xmath24 ( shull & van steenberg 1985 ) and @xmath122 ( cardelli , clayton , & mathis 1989 ) .",

    "the presence of dc  292.3@xmath00.4 also offers the chance to probe the distance to psr j1119@xmath06127 .",
    "recently , otrupcek , hartley & wang ( 2000 ) observed the 115 ghz ( j=1@xmath00 ) transition of co towards the center of each cloud in the hartley et al .",
    "two features with line - of - sight velocities of 12.6 km  s@xmath24 and 1.6 km  s@xmath24 were detected .",
    "unfortunately , with no way to discern which feature corresponds to the cloud , and as each feature implies two possible distance values , these co measurements can not provide a constraining lower limit for the pulsar s distance .",
    "the presence of two features is encouraging , however , as it suggests an additional cloud is present along the line of sight and also contributes to the absorption of soft x - rays from the eastern side of g292.2@xmath00.5 .",

    "it is also worth noting that with the recent discoveries of psrs  j1119@xmath06127 and j1846@xmath00258 , three of the four youngest pulsars in the galaxy ( as ranked by characteristic age ) have spin periods in the range 0.150.4s and very high inferred magnetic fields ; only the crab spins rapidly .",
    "this emphasizes that understanding the crab pulsar and its nebula is not akin to understanding young pulsar ",
    "snr systems in general , and more sensitive follow - up studies of systems such as psr  j1119@xmath06127snr  g292.2@xmath00.5  are essential .",
