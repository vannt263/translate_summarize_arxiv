    "<S> this is because there is not an obvious way to eliminate every other prime number in the prime zeta function without having a remainder to account for which can not be absorbed into the alternating prime zeta function itself to yield it analytically continuable in the critical strip . </S>",
    "<S> this comes as no surprise since there is not a recognizable repeating pattern in the sequence of prime numbers . in light of this impasse , another alternating function </S>",

    "<S> it is worth noting at this point that since the solution for base @xmath26 will be a complex number , the evaluation of @xmath27 will be a complex number taken to a complex power . </S>",

    "<S> thus , the zeros of the riemann zeta function can be pinpointed on the critical line when the following two conditions are met :    @xmath32    @xmath33    the mathematica @xcite plots in appendix b provide strong empirical evidence that the conditions stated in eqs . </S>",
    "<S> 15 and 16 are only met when the complex inputs @xmath14 are equal to the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function on the critical line . </S>",
    "<S> it is noted here that the good degree of accuracy manifested in the mathematica plots for @xmath34 versus @xmath35 was obtained using a domain of only the first thousand prime numbers as inputs into the prime sum and prime product functions . </S>",
    "<S> but while the plots in the appendices reveal some exciting properties of the @xmath36 , @xmath37 and the base @xmath26 functions , it is acknowledged that plots , in and of themselves , do not provide a formal proof . </S>",

    "<S> specifically , it was discovered that the two base @xmath26 functions coincide exactly on the left - hand side of the critical strip but begin to diverge for @xmath38 when the imaginary part of @xmath14 is zero . </S>",

    "<S> therefore , the only common ground where all relationships are satisfied between the @xmath26 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 functions simultaneously are on the critical line @xmath23 at the location of the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function ( i.e. , when @xmath45 ) . </S>",

    "<S> 12 be equal to @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the new zeta function represented by eq . </S>",
    "<S> 12 allows us to find the non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function directly by setting the right - hand side of that equation equal to zero . </S>",
    "<S> to summarize ,    @xmath46    defined as    @xmath47     +    and the condition    @xmath48    will only be met when the complex input @xmath14 is equal to a non - trivial zero of the riemann function of the form @xmath30 in the critical strip . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it is concluded that all non - trivial zeros of the riemann zeta function must lie on the @xmath49 line in the critical strip . +        _ fig . 1 - the b functions and zeta / meta functions in the right - half of the real plane . </S>",

    "<S> to do so , one only has to create a loop function which will pinpoint the imaginary zeros on the critical line to any desired degree of accuracy using the criteria @xmath50 and @xmath51 . </S>",
