    "state - of - the - art calculations  @xcite suggest that the electroweak vacuum of the standard model suffers an instability at a scale of around @xmath0 gev , with the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum lying in the so - called metastable region and being longer than the current age of the universe ( for a recent overview , see ref .",
    "the origin of this instability is the generation of a high - scale global minimum in the higgs potential through radiative effects due to the renormalization - group running of the higgs quartic self - coupling  @xcite .",
    "specifically , when one applies the standard renormalization procedure , this coupling is driven negative by top - quark loops , with the dominant experimental uncertainty originating from the current measurement of the top mass  @xcite .",
    "the latter effect has , however , been challenged recently  @xcite in the light of contradictory observations from lattice simulations of higgs - yukawa models  @xcite , where the full effective potential is found to remain stable so long as the ultraviolet cutoff is kept finite . moreover ,",
    "the presence of new physics at high scales has been shown to have a dramatic impact upon the tunneling rate  @xcite .",
    "often , the tunneling rate is determined from the effective potential  @xcite calculated assuming a homogeneous field configuration , which is subsequently promoted to an inhomogeneous field configuration  @xcite .",
    "thus , the impact of the space - time dependence of the underlying tunneling configuration is not fully accounted for .    in light of the aforementioned theoretical and phenomenological questions ,",
    "it is timely to consider approaches to the calculation of tunneling rates from false vacua that can consistently account for radiative effects in the inhomogeneous solitonic background of the tunneling configuration .",

    "@xcite for dealing with potentials that are _ significantly _ modified by radiative effects , the aim being to understand the parametric dependencies of the tunneling rate and the relative importance of gradient effects .",

    ", we will consider the importance of accounting for the aforementioned space - time dependence of the tunneling configuration in the case of _ spontaneous _ decay of an initially _ homogeneous _ false vacuum state .",
    "this is in contrast to _ induced _ transitions where an _ inhomogeneous _ initial state acts as a potential seed for vacuum decay , as has been studied for the case of black holes  @xcite , for topological defects  @xcite and , in the context of the standard model , for impurities in the higgs vacuum @xcite .",
