    "<S> the recent explosion of research interest in weyl semimetals has led to many proposed weyl semimetal candidates and a few experimental observations of a weyl semimetal in real materials . through this experience , </S>",
    "<S> we have come to appreciate that typical weyl semimetals host many weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the first weyl semimetal observed in experiment , taas , hosts 24 weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series , recently under study as the first type ii weyl semimetal , has eight weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> however , it is well - understood that for a weyl semimetal without inversion symmetry but with time - reversal symmetry , the minimum number of weyl points is four . </S>",
    "<S> realizing such a minimal weyl semimetal is fundamentally relevant because it would offer the simplest `` hydrogen atom '' example of an inversion - breaking weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> at the same time , transport experiments and device applications may be simpler in a system with as few weyl points as possible . </S>",
    "<S> recently , tairte@xmath3  has been predicted to be a minimal inversion - breaking weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> however , crucially , the weyl points and fermi arcs live entirely above the fermi level , making them inaccessible to conventional angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) . here </S>",
    "<S> we use pump - probe arpes to directly access the band structure above the fermi level in tairte@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we directly observe weyl points and topological fermi arcs , showing that tairte@xmath3  is a weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> we find that , in total , tairte@xmath3  has four weyl points , providing the first example of a minimal inversion - breaking weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> our results hold promise for accessing exotic transport phenomena arising in weyl semimetals in a real material .    </S>",
    "<S> a weyl semimetal is a crystal which hosts emergent weyl fermions as electronic quasiparticles . in an electronic band structure , </S>",
    "<S> these weyl fermions correspond to accidental degeneracies , or weyl points , between two bands @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is well - understood that weyl points can only arise if a material breaks either spatial inversion symmetry , @xmath4 , or time - reversal symmetry , @xmath5  @xcite . at the same time , in a weyl semimetal , symmetries of the system tend to produce copies of weyl points in the brillouin zone . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , typical weyl semimetals host a proliferation of weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , the first weyl semimetals observed in experiment , taas and its isoelectronic cousins , have an @xmath4  breaking crystal structure which gives rise to a band structure hosting @xmath6 weyl points distributed throughout the bulk brillouin zone @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , most of these weyl points can be related to one another by the remaining symmetries of taas , namely two mirror symmetries , @xmath7 rotation symmetry and @xmath5 . in the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series , which has recently been under intensive theoretical and experimental study as a weyl semimetal with strongly lorentz - violating , or type ii , </S>",
    "<S> weyl fermions , mirror symmetry and @xmath5  relate subsets of the eight weyl points @xcite . as another example , according to calculation , the weyl semimetal candidate srsi@xmath2 hosts no fewer than 108 weyl points , copied in sets of 18 by three @xmath7 rotation symmetries @xcite . despite the rather large numbers of weyl points which arise in these materials </S>",
    "<S> , it is known that for a weyl semimetal which breaks @xmath4  but maintains @xmath5 , the minimal nonzero number of weyl points allowed is 4 . </S>",
    "<S> realizing such a minimal weyl semimetal is not only of fundamental interest , but is also practically important , because a system with fewer weyl points may exhibit simpler properties in transport and be more suitable for device applications .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , tairte@xmath3  was predicted to be a weyl semimetal with only four weyl points , the minimum allowed for an @xmath4  breaking weyl semimetal @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was further noted that the weyl points are associated with strongly lorentz - violating , or type ii , weyl fermions , providing only the third example of a type ii weyl semimetal after the mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  series and laalge , also under recent study @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the weyl points are well - separated in momentum space , with substantially larger topological fermi arcs as a fraction of the size of the surface brillouin zone than other known weyl semimetals . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , tairte@xmath3  has a layered crystal structure , which may make it easier to carry out transport experiments and develop device applications . </S>",
    "<S> all of these desirable properties have motivated considerable research interest in tairte@xmath3 . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , one crucial challenge is that the weyl points and topological fermi arcs are predicted to live entirely above the fermi level in tairte@xmath3 , so that they are inaccessible to conventional angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) .    here </S>",
    "<S> we directly observe weyl points and topological fermi arcs in tairte@xmath3 , realizing the first minimal @xmath4  breaking weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> we first briefly reiterate a well - known theoretical argument that the minimum number of weyl points for an @xmath4  breaking weyl semimetal is four . </S>",
    "<S> then , we use pump - probe angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( pump - probe arpes ) to directly access the band structure of tairte@xmath3  above the fermi level in experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we report the direct observation of weyl points and topological fermi arcs . </S>",
    "<S> our results experimentally demonstrate that tairte@xmath3  has four weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that tairte@xmath3  can be viewed as a `` hydrogen atom '' weyl semimetal , with the simplest configuration of weyl points allowed in an @xmath4  breaking system that maintains @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we first reiterate well - known arguments that four is the minimum number of weyl points allowed in an @xmath4  breaking weyl semimetal which respects @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a weyl point is associated with a chiral charge , directly related to the chirality of the associated emergent weyl fermion . </S>",
    "<S> it can be shown that for any given band the sum of all chiral charges in the brillouin zone is zero . </S>",
    "<S> further , under @xmath5 a weyl point of a given chiral charge at @xmath8 is mapped to another weyl point of the same chiral charge at @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> this operation of @xmath5 on a chiral charge is illustrated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a on the blue colored weyl point with @xmath10 chiral charge . </S>",
    "<S> now , if an @xmath4 breaking weyl semimetal has no additional symmetries which produce copies of weyl points , then only the global requirement that total chiral charge vanish and @xmath5 determine the minimum number of weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> in the simplest case , @xmath5  will produce two copies of weyl points of chiral charge @xmath10 , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]a . to balance these out the system must have two chiral charges of @xmath11 , also related by @xmath5 . in this way , </S>",
    "<S> the minimum number of weyl points in a @xmath5  invariant weyl semimetal is four . </S>",
    "<S> this simple scenario is realized in tairte@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the crystal structure of tairte@xmath3 is described by space group 31 ( @xmath12 ) , lattice constants @xmath13  , @xmath14  , and @xmath15  , with layered crystal structure , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]b . </S>",
    "<S> we note that tairte@xmath3  takes the same space group as mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 , has a unit cell doubled along @xmath16 . to study how the weyl points emerge in tairte@xmath3 we present the electronic band structure along various high - symmetry directions , see brillouin zone and _ ab initio _ calculation in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]c , d. enclosed by the rectangular box along @xmath17-@xmath18 is a crossing region between the bulk conduction and valence bands that gives rise to weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> a more detailed calculation shows that the weyl points have tilted over , or type ii , weyl cones and that they live above the fermi level , @xmath19  at @xmath20 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a cartoon schematic of the resulting constant energy contour at the energy of the weyl points , @xmath21 , is shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1]e for the ( 001 ) plane . </S>",
    "<S> illustrated is a large electron pocket ( blue colored ) and smaller hole pockets ( orange colored ) oriented along @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron and hole pockets form type ii weyl cones where they touch ( red and blue marks ) . in this way , tairte@xmath3 has four weyl points , the minimal number allowed in an @xmath4 breaking weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> the overall electronic structure of tairte@xmath3  near @xmath19  is similar to mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 , but we note that the role of the electron and hole pockets is reversed in tairte@xmath3  relative to mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 </S>",
    "<S> . more importantly , tairte@xmath3  hosts the minimal number of weyl points four , while mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  hosts eight , and tairte@xmath3  also hosts larger fermi arc surface states . to study the expected fermi arcs in tairte@xmath3 , we present an energy - dispersion cut along a pair of projected weyl points along @xmath23 , fig.[fig1]f . </S>",
    "<S> we clearly observe a large single fermi arc surface state at @xmath24 ev above the fermi level that is @xmath25 @xmath26 long and connecting a pair of @xmath27 chiral charged weyl points along @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , tairte@xmath3 serves as an tantalizing platform for realizing and studing the highly anticipated `` hydrogen atom '' weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that the weyl points and fermi arcs live well above the fermi level , making them inaccessible by conventional arpes .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we use pump - probe arpes to directly access the unoccupied band structure of tairte@xmath3  up to @xmath29 ev and we find excellent agreement with calculation . in our experiment </S>",
    "<S> , we use a @xmath30ev pump laser pulse to excite electrons into low - lying states above the fermi level , followed by a @xmath31ev probe laser pulse to perform photoemission @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we study @xmath32-@xmath22 cuts near @xmath33 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]a - c , with key features marked by guides to eye in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]d . above the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> , we see a beautiful , wispy crossing - like feature near @xmath34 ev , labelled 1 , and two electron - like bands , 2 and 3 , extending out above @xmath19 , forming the horns of a viking helmet . below the fermi level </S>",
    "<S> , we observe a general hole - like structure consisting of three bands , labelled 4 - 6 . </S>",
    "<S> as we shift @xmath28 off @xmath33 , we find little change in the spectrum , suggesting that the band structure is rather flat along @xmath28 near @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> however , we can observe that band 4 moves downward in energy and becomes more intense with increasing @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we find an excellent match between our arpes data and _ ab initio _ calculation , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]e - g . </S>",
    "<S> specifically , we identify the same wispy crossing ( green arrow ) and top of band 4 ( orange arrow ) . we can also track band 4 in @xmath28 in calculation and we find that the band moves down and becomes brighter as @xmath28 increases , in excellent agreement with the data . </S>",
    "<S> the electron - like structure of bands 2 and 3 and the hole - like structure of bands 5 and 6 are also both captured well by the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , however , we notice a shift in energy between experiment and theory , showing that the sample is hole - doped by @xmath35 ev . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we plot a constant energy @xmath22-@xmath28 cut at @xmath36 , where we see again that there is little dispersion along @xmath28 near @xmath33 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2]h . </S>",
    "<S> we also indicate the locations of the @xmath32-@xmath22 cuts ( blue lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> our pump - probe arpes measurements allow us to directly measure the electronic structure above @xmath19  in tairte@xmath3  and we find excellent match with the calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> now we demonstrate that tairte@xmath3  is a weyl semimetal by directly studying the unoccupied band structure to pinpoint weyl cones and topological fermi arcs . </S>",
    "<S> we study @xmath32-@xmath28 cuts where , based on calculation , we fix @xmath22 near the locations of the weyl points , @xmath37 , see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]a - c , with key features marked by guides to the eye in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> we observe two cone features , labelled 1 and 2 , connected by a weak , rather flat arc feature , labelled 3 . </S>",
    "<S> we next track the cone and arc candidates for @xmath22 away from @xmath38 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]e - g . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the cones are most pronounced at @xmath39 , but fade for larger @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the arc disperses slightly upward , by @xmath40 mev ( yellow arrow ) , while the band 4 disperses downward by @xmath41 mev . </S>",
    "<S> this dispersion is consistent with a topological fermi arc , which should connect the weyl points and sweep upward with increasing @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> based solely on our pump - probe arpes spectra , we propose that tairte@xmath3  hosts two pairs of weyl points of chiral charge @xmath42 at @xmath43 , connected by fermi arcs . </S>",
    "<S> especially when viewed on a @xmath32-@xmath28 cut , this configuration of weyl cones and fermi arcs is arguably the simplest possible in any weyl semimetal , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]h . to provide further evidence for this interpretation </S>",
    "<S> , we compare our results to calculation , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]i - k . </S>",
    "<S> we can easily match the weyl cones , the fermi arc and an upper electron - like band , labelled 5 in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]d . </S>",
    "<S> however , we note that from calculation we expect bands 1 and 4 to attach to form a single band , while in our data they appear to be disconnected . in addition </S>",
    "<S> , we do not observe the lower band labelled 6 in our calculation , which may be an artifact of our measurement . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we consistently observe the broad featureless intensity below the fermi level in both theory and experiment . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , again we find a mismatch in the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the weyl points are expected at @xmath44 ev , but we find the weyl points at @xmath45 ev . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that the sample is electron doped by @xmath46 mev , in contrast to our results in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , where we observe an apparent @xmath46 mev hole doping . </S>",
    "<S> we propose that the difference in doping of the two samples may arise because they were grown under slightly varying conditions in two separate batches . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we note that the @xmath28 position of the weyl points shows excellent agreement in theory and experiment . the excellent agreement between our pump - probe arpes spectra and _ ab initio _ </S>",
    "<S> calculation confirms our observation of weyl cones and topological fermi arcs in tairte@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we can better understand the configuration of weyl points on a constant - energy @xmath22-@xmath28 cut at @xmath21 , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3]l . </S>",
    "<S> we indicate the weyl points ( blue arrows ) and the locations of the @xmath32-@xmath22 cuts ( blue lines ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also note that our results are entirely consistent with the earlier prediction of a weyl semimetal in tairte@xmath3  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our pump - probe arpes spectra demonstrate that tairte@xmath3  is a weyl semimetal with four weyl points .    </S>",
    "<S> we compare tairte@xmath3  with other weyl semimetals and consider our results in the context of general topological theory . </S>",
    "<S> weyl semimetals known to date in experiment host a greater number of weyl points than tairte@xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the well - explored taas family of weyl semimetals hosts 24 weyl points and mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2  hosts eight weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> we plot the configuration of weyl points for taas , mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 , and tairte@xmath3 , where red and blue circles denote weyl points of opposite chirality , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]a - c . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to note that the length of the fermi arc in tairte@xmath3  is much longer as a fraction of the brillouin zone than that of taas or mo@xmath0w@xmath1te@xmath2 , which can be seen clearly in the projections of the weyl points on the ( 001 ) surface of all three systems , fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4]d - f . </S>",
    "<S> we see that our discovery of a weyl semimetal in tairte@xmath3  provides the first example of a minimal `` hydrogen atom '' version of an @xmath4  breaking weyl semimetal . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that tairte@xmath3  holds promise as a simpler material platform for studying the novel properties of weyl semimetals in transport and applying them in novel devices . </S>"
