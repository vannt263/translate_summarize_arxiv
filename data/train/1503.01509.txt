    "these serve as a foreground for the sought planck - physics events ; the detectors necessarily sift through many events to detect the few that are interesting . as such , accelerators built to detect planck events are extremely wasteful and produce vast amounts of `` pollution '' .",
    "the minimum amount of energy needed to run the accelerator is @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of planck - scale events sought , @xmath98 is the inelasticity of a typical collision , and @xmath99 is the cross section for any kind of interaction between the beam particles .",
    "hadron - hadron colliders like the lhc are the easiest to build because they avoid synchrotron energy losses , but they are especially wasteful . in our current understanding of qcd ,",
    "the typical cross section of @xmath100 collisions is @xmath101 and increases with energy to about @xmath102 at planck scale , with an inelasticity of @xmath103 to 0.2 @xcite . only 1 in @xmath104 collisions would contain the signatures of planck - scale physics , and each of those collisions involves a proton that has been accelerated to planck energy .",
    "the total amount of energy is @xmath105 , a hundred times the entire mass - energy of the sun .",
    "leptonic colliders with electrons or muons as beam particles are limited by pair production processes that also have cross sections of a barn .",
    "thus , planck - scale accelerators require cosmic engineering , simply to ensure that there are enough events that are interesting .",
    "the situation is actually worse than this for hadronic colliders .",
    "hadrons contain partons ( quarks , antiquarks , and gluons ) that carry only a fraction of the energy of the entire hadron , and it is the partons that actually undergo reactions .",

    "thus , the exponential factor in equation  [ eqn : pacoustic ] is @xmath479 for @xmath480 , @xmath481 for @xmath482 , and @xmath483 for @xmath484 . despite the enormous losses , the pulse from a 100 yev neutrino is so loud that it could be detected @xmath485 away by an array sensitive to 0.01 pa sounds .",
    "the other limitation is the narrowness of the acoustic disk .",
    "if a neutrino comes from the zenith , the acoustic disk expands outwards into the sea without interacting with the seafloor and sea surface .",
    "but if a neutrino comes from the horizon , most of the sound is directed towards the seafloor and sea surface .",
    "a neutrino must have a zenith angle of @xmath486 to be regarded as horizontal , where @xmath405 is the ocean depth .",
    "for @xmath487 , this limits the zenith angle to about @xmath488 , or only 0.3% of the celestial sphere .",
    "a completely vertical neutrino illuminates only @xmath489 in azimuth out to large distances .",
    "if we were only interested in detecting zenith neutrinos , then we could settle for a few detectors per @xmath490 . to cover the earth",
    "s oceans would require @xmath491 detectors . for comparison , the saund ii array used only 49 hydrophones @xcite .",
    "furthermore , these detectors would actually be strings of hydrophones , to ensure that one intersects the acoustic disk @xcite .",
    "but since the distance between the strings is big , the hydrophones can be spaced about one per kilometer on the strings .",
    "the effective etendue of an ocean array that detected only zenith neutrinos would actually be less than numoon , although a hydrophone array that covered the earth could observe in all directions and have a longer livetime . to effectively detect horizon neutrinos on - disk , the number of detector strings",
    "must be multiplied by @xmath492 , for a grand total of @xmath493 strings .",
    "a much more promising route is to consider the off - disk acoustic emission from a shower .",
    "because of the exponential attenuation factor , the range only depends logarithmically on @xmath459 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the sound fluence of a hadronic shower @xmath494 away from the disk is about 0.1% of maximum .",
    "unfortunately , the sound emission at larger angles is not given .",
    "as a fiducial estimate , suppose @xmath495 .",
    "the pressure differential then remains above 1 pa out to @xmath496 for a 100 yev neutrino ( 0.01 pa sensitivity ) , increasing the number of detectors by a factor of @xmath497 only . for a planck neutrino ,",
    "the range increases to @xmath498 ( 0.01 pa sensitivity ) .",
    "furthermore , the detectors would not have to be strings , since they would be listening for the isotropic sound emission .",
    "it may be worthwhile to study the low frequency component of these pulses with care .",
    "sounds below a khz can propagate thousands of kilometers , so a very sparse array might be able to detect the cascades of the highest energy neutrinos .",
    "it would take exposures of earth - centuries or millennia to rule out k3 yev accelerators anywhere in the universe , much less those with the minimal luminosities listed in table  [ table : acceleratorpower ] .",
    "but must we limit ourselves to earth , if we are going to extrapolate that far into the future ?",
    "jupiter has a surface area that is @xmath499 times bigger than that of earth .",
    "could we deploy acoustic detectors throughout jupiter s atmosphere to listen for yev neutrinos ?",
    "i will be fanciful for a moment about our capabilities this far in the future and ignore the logistics .",
    "maybe the detectors can be quickly deployed by launching them on self - replicating machines , creating an ecology of `` floaters '' once speculated to live in jupiter @xcite .",
    "the basic challenge facing any such attempt at instrumentation is that the density of an atmosphere is low while the column density to stop a yev neutrino is relatively high ( equation  [ eqn : uhenucolumn ] ) .",
    "the outer thousand kilometers of jupiter s atmosphere is approximately adiabatic with @xmath500 @xcite . from the equation of hydrostatic stability , @xmath501 , the density in jupiter s atmosphere at depth @xmath405 is @xmath502^{3/2 } \\rho_0.\\ ] ] the column of the atmosphere above depth @xmath405 is given by @xmath503 , so that @xmath504 .",
    "define as a reference `` surface '' the 1 bar depth of jupiter s atmosphere , where @xmath505 , @xmath506 , and the temperature is @xmath507 @xcite .",
    "the gravitational acceleration in the outer parts of jupiter is @xmath508 .",
    "neutrinos interact at a typical depth of @xmath509 where the density is @xmath510 and the pressure is @xmath511 .",
    "the temperatures at these depths are @xmath512 jupiter s atmosphere may be nonadiabatic at depths greater than @xmath513 , and the temperature could be somewhat lower @xcite , but in any case @xmath514 is extremely deep .",
    "these physical conditions present enormous challenges to detecting neutrinos .",
    "the pressure is a few times that in earth s deepest ocean trenches , but the temperature is far beyond even the surface of venus .",
    "no known electronics can withstand @xmath515 temperatures for any significant time ; indeed , most solid materials melt at these depths .",
    "even if the material engineering challenges could be overcome , the high temperatures lead to a huge thermal background of noise that would cover up neutrino signals .",
    "similar considerations apply for the other gas giants , not to mention the sun .",
    "gaseous atmospheres are a poor choice for a yev neutrino detector target because they are too compressible .",
    "the pressure in an incompressible liquid ocean made of water builds up rapidly , as its density does not change with depth .",
    "the pressure and density of a liquid is basically independent of its temperature . but a gas can support the increased pressure load by becoming hotter without becoming much denser . because of the much lower gas densities , neutrino absorption occurs very deep in the atmosphere , where it is extremely hot .",
    "the minor bodies of the solar system collectively have more surface area than the major bodies .",
    "moreover , they are solid , so that @xmath516 columns are achieved in all minor bodies with radii @xmath517 . detecting neutrinos in these icy objects does not even require landing on them .",
    "an orbiting satellite can detect radio cherenkov pulses from neutrino showers within them , as proposed for europa @xcite and enceladus @xcite .    in terms of mass ,",
    "the kuiper belt is the largest reservoir of minor bodies within 100 au .",
    "collectively , they have a large surface area .",
    "the radius distribution of kuiper belt objects ( kbos ) is @xmath518 for @xmath519 , as determined by stellar occultations @xcite .",
    "this integrates to a collective surface area of @xmath520 for kbos with @xmath521 .",
    "smaller objects have an exposure penalty , since the probability for neutrino interaction goes as @xmath522 when the column depth is less than @xmath523 : @xmath524 .",
    "i find that there is roughly @xmath525 in surface area on kbos with @xmath526 , and another @xmath525 on kbos with @xmath527 .",
    "far greater populations may exist in the oort cloud , although they are much harder to reach .",
    "a future civilization may instrument the larger kbos to detect yev neutrinos , attaining an exposure rate about @xmath497 times greater than that from the earth alone .",
    "if this becomes practical within a few centuries , the total integrated exposure to yev neutrinos could be increased rapidly with a few decades of observation time .",
    "the main practical challenge is the sheer number of objects that would need to be observed .",
    "there are roughly @xmath528 kbos with radii between 10 and 45 km , and about @xmath529 with radii between 1 km and 10 km .",
    "merely finding all of these objects , much less visiting them all , is a formidable challenge . unlike the case of jupiter ,",
    "no miraculous advances in material science are needed , though .",
    "do some aliens leave their home planets and go on to cosmic engineering , do they all die before they can try , or do they all decide to stay at home ?",
    "the fermi paradox implies the first possibility is always wrong if ets exist in any numbers .",
    "otherwise it is evidence that ets are very rare .",
    "one issue with the argument is that most of the proposed reasons for cosmic engineering involve either contacting young , human - like societies across the universe , or consuming cosmic amounts of energy . remaking stars and galaxies to get our attention can seem a bit extravagant to get our attention , and consuming everything within reach is a questionable project if ets care about sustainability and avoiding aggression with other ets .",
    "but i suggest there s at least one more motivation , curiosity : _ some scientific problems can only be answered with cosmic engineering_.    the nightmare of particle physics is the dream of astronomers searching for ets .",
    "planck accelerators must be bigger than the sun , for realistic electromagnetic field strengths ( section  [ sec : bigaccelerators ] ) .",
    "the power used by a planck accelerator is cosmic , because the natural cross section of planck physics is tiny , with only one planck event occurring per @xmath530 collisions ( section  [ sec : brightaccelerators ] ) .",
    "the luminosities necessary for a hadronic collider in particular requires a k3 entity , if the experiment is to be completed within a million years ( table  [ table : acceleratorpower ] ) . whether or not they feel like communicating , we can still look for these kinds of energy usages .",
    "the conditions in the accelerator region may be very hostile if it is a dirty fireball with a compactness problem , thermalizing all of the high energy particles .",
    "mesons and muons can be cooled before they decay into neutrinos , although we can still hope to see prompt neutrinos from kaons , charm , and beauty .",
    "alternatively , yev  xev radiation generated by the collisions could escape if the collider is clean or highly relativistic ( section  [ sec : acceleratorconditions ] ) .",
    "cosmic ray nucleons , photons , and @xmath316 can be detected from tens of mpc away if they escape , and neutrinos are not stopped at all ( section  [ sec : propagation ] ) .",
    "if nothing else , we can find planck accelerators by their thermal emission , although it may emerge at much higher energies than the mid - infrared wavelengths of dyson spheres ( section  [ sec : hiddenaccelerators ] ) .",
    "our current knowledge of the high energy neutrino backgrounds implies that k3 yev neutrino sources are typically at least 30 mpc apart , if they are steady and radiate isotropically ( sections  [ sec : steadybackground ] and  [ sec : indirect ] ) .",
    "individual k3 accelerators can only be detected out to about 2 mpc .",
    "in addition , there is no k2.5 or brighter 100 yev neutrino source within about 10 kpc , implying there are no active planck accelerators in the galaxy ( section  [ sec : steadybackground ] ) .",
    "lofar searches for radio cherenkov pulses on the moon can improve yev neutrino exposures by a factor of ten to a hundred , mainly because of a longer exposure time ( section  [ sec : currentexperiments ] ) .",
    "if we could place hydrophone arrays throughout the earth s oceans and listen for cascade acoustic signals for a year , we could improve the bounds by another factor of a thousand .",
    "there are many practical difficulties , though , particularly the @xmath415 hydrophones required and the beaming of the acoustic signals ( section  [ sec : oceans ] ) . exposures",
    "much beyond an earth - year might be achieved in the far future by searching with satellites for radio cherenkov pulses in all @xmath531 kuiper belt objects wider than 20 km ( section  [ sec : bigexperiments ] ) .",
    "the universe emits very little nonthermal emission ",
    "the lack of observed yev neutrinos is just one symptom of this fact .",
    "if the universe were filled with diverse cosmic engineers with varying motives , one might figure that there would be artificial emission across all energies and messengers .",
    "some of their projects might generate radio broadcasts ; other might generate @xmath274-ray emission ; others still neutrinos or gravitational waves  a sort of copernican principle for messengers .    but almost all of the luminosity of the universe is thermal , with @xmath532 in the infrared to ultraviolet bands @xcite , and a similar density in thermal mev neutrinos emitted during core - collapse supernovae @xcite .",
    "the characteristic energy density of uhecrs and neutrinos , the waxman - bahcall limit , is a _ million _ times smaller @xcite .",
    "likewise , the gev @xmath274-ray background has a density that is @xmath533 that of the ebl @xcite . while the intensity of the extragalactic ghz radio background is disputed , it is at most @xmath534 the density of the ebl @xcite and perhaps a factor of 10 below that . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the constraints just become even tighter , with @xmath535 @xcite .",
    "while it is true that most of the power used in cosmic engineering must be thermal emission , if even one in a thousand galaxies had a k3 entity that emitted 1% of its power in one of these bands , they would overproduce the observed background radiation .",
    "the problem is especially severe at radio wavelengths , where we can now observe star - forming galaxies out to high redshift . yet most star - forming galaxies appear to lie on the far - infrared  radio correlation , indicating natural synchrotron and free - free radio emission @xcite .",
    "k3 radio emitters would make these galaxies _ brighter _ at radio wavelengths and easier to see , but we have not found any artificial extragalactic radio ( or @xmath274-ray or neutrino ) sources .",
    "cosmic engineering s effect on the universe appears to be utterly minuscule , and the fermi paradox remains mystifying .",
    "although searches for uhecrs and neutrinos of all energies from ets have been proposed in the past @xcite , there has not been a dedicated effort to do them , unlike in radio and optical .",
    "there are crucial differences between neutrino and radio / optical astronomy that are relevant .",
    "radio and optical telescopes use _",
    "focusing optics_. their fields of view are small , so they must be aimed , except for something like the fast fourier transform telescope @xcite .",
    "in addition , individual photons are easy to detect .",
    "the backgrounds from natural sources and the galaxy mean that one must carefully search for desired signals",
    ". a radio / optical telescope can not be simply turned on and left to search the entire sky for any signal from all sources .",
    "observations need specific goals in these wavebands .",
    "if seti is not an explicit goal of the observers , one must settle for a `` commensal '' program , where one searches for artificial signals within the field of view of the primary targets , hoping that ets happen to lie in those directions @xcite .",
    "in contrast , neutrino telescopes can not be aimed . while the geometry of the earth or the moon can target some of the sky , their fields of view are nonetheless vast .",
    "we can not focus high energy neutrinos ; nor can we move cubic kilometers of ice or water or regolith , much less entire planets .",
    "thus , there is no real way to be specific about the targets of a neutrino telescope .",
    "the main challenge instead is simply detecting individual neutrinos , just because they are so rare , and figuring out where they come from .",
    "any experiment looking for high energy neutrinos is a seti experiment , since every observing program is commensal with every other for high energy neutrinos . as experiments across the neutrino spectrum , from tev to yev ,",
    "reach the astrophysically motivated waxman - bahcall bound , neutrino seti automatically begins .    to be clear , planck scale seti is not a replacement for more traditional radio and optical seti .",
    "rather the two are complimentary @xcite . we do nt actually know cosmic engineers can exist ,",
    "but we do know of one radio- and optical - broadcasting society , our own .",
    "conversely , even if cosmic engineers are rare , they can be seen across the universe .",
    "furthermore , radio wavelengths may be particularly useful for searching for k3 entities , just because galaxies are typically so faint in radio and the sensitivity of current radio instruments is far greater than in @xmath274-rays or neutrinos .",
    "detection of yev radiation of any kind would imply a completely new class of astrophysical objects , either an unprecedented particle accelerator @xcite or something even weirder like a topological defect . whether or not cosmic engineers exist",
