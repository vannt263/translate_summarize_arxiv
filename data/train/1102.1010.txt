    "superconductivity discovery in lafeaso@xmath9f@xmath10 has triggered intense research activity that resulted in critical temperatures up to 56 k in pnictide materials.@xcite@xmath11@xcite soon after , several types of iron - based superconductors have been discovered , such as afe@xmath12as@xmath12 ( a = alkaline or alkaline - earth metals , 122-type),@xcite@xmath13@xcite lifeas ( 111-type),@xcite ( sr@xmath14m@xmath12o@xmath15)(fe@xmath12pn@xmath12 ) ( m = sc , ti or v , 42622-type),@xcite@xmath13@xcite and @xmath16-pbo type fese ( 11-type)@xcite etc .",
    "the 11-type materials fese , fete@xmath9se@xmath10,@xcite and fete@xmath9s@xmath10@xcite provided an example  of iron based superconductivity in a rather simple crystal structure without the charge reservoir layer . yet",
    ", these simple binary structures share a square - planar lattice of fe with tetrahedral coordination and similar fermi surface topology with other iron - based superconductors.@xcite furthermore , 11-type superconductors contain some distinctive structural and physical features , such as interstitial iron fe@xmath17te and the significant pressure effect.@xcite@xmath11@xcite under external pressure , the @xmath18 can be increased from 8 k to 37 k and the @xmath19 can reach 9.1 k / gpa , the highest increase in all iron - base superconductors.@xcite this behavior may be understood from the observation related to the anion height between fe and as ( or se , te ) layers . there is an optimal distance around 1.38   with a maximum transition temperature @xmath20 55 k.mizuguchi3 the anion height in fese decreases gradually with the pressure increase towards the optimal value thereby increasing @xmath18.mizuguchi3 quite importantly , high upper critical fields and currents were demonstrated in iron based superconductors.@xcite@xmath11@xcite    another method for tuning of the anion height is the intercalation between fese layers that can change both the local environment of fe - se tetrahedron and the average crystal structure .",
    "the intercalation could also decrease dimensionality of conducting bands .",
    "the presence of low energy electronic collective modes in layered conductors helps screening coulomb interaction , which may contribute constructively to superconductivity.@xcite this is seen in iron based superconductors : the @xmath18 increases from 11-type to 1111-type . very recently",
    "the @xmath18  was raised in iron selenide material to about 30 k by intercalating k , rb , cs , and tl between the fese layers ( afese-122 type),@xcite@xmath11@xcite as opposed to pressure .",
    "the intercalation of alkaline metals decreases se height,@xcite and changes the average space group from p4/nmm of fese to i4/mmm of afese-122 type .",
    "the fe - se interlayer distances are expanded and may contribute to electronic and magnetic dimensionality reduction .",
    "furthermore , insulator - superconductor transition ( ist ) can be induced by tuning the fe stoichiometry in ( tl@xmath9k@xmath10)fe@xmath21se@xmath12 ( 0 @xmath22 x @xmath22 1 , 0 @xmath22 y @xmath22 1).@xcite this suggests that the superconductivity of afese-122 type is in proximity of a mott insulating state.@xcite thus it is of interest to study electronic and magnetic anisotropy in normal and superconducting states in afese-122 in order to shed more light on the superconducting mechanism and possible symmetry of the order parameter .    in this work , we report the anisotropy in electronic transport and magnetization in the normal state of k@xmath23fe@xmath24se@xmath25 single crystals",
    ". we also present anisotropic parameters of the superconducting state .",
    "single crystals of k@xmath10fe@xmath12se@xmath12 were grown by self - flux method with nominal composition k@xmath26fe@xmath12se@xmath12 .",
    "prereacted fese and k pieces ( purity 99.999% , alfa aesar ) were put into the alumina crucible , and sealed into the quartz tube with partial pressure of argon .",

    "the lattice parameters were obtained by fitting the xrd spectra using the rietica software.@xcite the elemental analysis was performed using an energy - dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( edx ) in an jeol jsm-6500 scanning electron microscope .",

    "the in - plane resistivity @xmath33 was measured using a four - probe configuration on rectangularly shaped and polished single crystals with current flowing in the ab - plane of tetragonal structure .",
    "the c - axis resistivity @xmath34 was measured by attaching current and voltage wires on the opposite sides of the plate - like sample.@xcite@xmath13@xcite * *  * * since the sample surface is easily oxidized , sample manipulation in air was limited to 10 minutes .",

    "these two distinct sets of reflections could arise from the inhomogeneous distribution of k atoms , which also observed in other afese-122 single crystals.wang hd@xmath13@xcite the average stoichiometry was determined from edx by examination of multiple points on the crystals .",
