    "in the previous paper @xcite we described the calculation of the electromagnetic corrections to the three hadronic phase shifts with @xmath10 for @xmath11 elastic scattering at pion laboratory kinetic energy @xmath12 mev , using relativised schrdinger equations ( rses ) containing the sum of an electromagnetic potential and an effective hadronic potential . in section 1 of ref.@xcite we gave our reasons for using such a potential model rather than the dispersion theory model of the nordita group @xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to describe the corresponding calculations for the two - channel ( @xmath3 , @xmath13 ) system in the same energy region .",
    "the phase - shift analysis ( psa ) of the low energy @xmath11 elastic scattering data and the simultaneous calculation of the electromagnetic corrections was possible because , ignoring the minute inelasticities due to bremsstrahlung , only one real phase shift is needed for each partial wave .",
    "such a programme is not possible for the low energy @xmath3 scattering data because three parameters ( two eigenphases and a mixing angle ) , and therefore three electromagnetic corrections , need to be obtained for each partial wave .",
    "however , while the set of @xmath3 elastic scattering data is only slightly smaller ( roughly 300 points ) than the set of @xmath11 data , there are only 53 published data points for charge exchange scattering in our energy range .",
    "it is quite out of the question to extract nine parameters from a psa of the available data without making further assumptions .",
    "the data can reliably yield only one parameter for each partial wave , as in the @xmath11 case .",
    "that means that we are forced in the two - channel case to invoke the assumption of isospin invariance for the hadronic interaction in some form .",
    "the situation is further complicated by the presence of differences between the physical masses of the charged and neutral particles . since we keep to the point of view adopted in ref.@xcite , that we take account only of those electromagnetic effects that can be calculated with reasonable confidence , we analyse the @xmath3 data and calculate the electromagnetic corrections on the assumption that the two - channel system can be treated at the effective hadronic level ( which is certainly not the true hadronic situation when the electromagnetic interaction is switched off ) as an isospin invariant system with all the pions having the physical mass @xmath14 of @xmath15 and both @xmath6 and @xmath7 having the physical mass @xmath16 .",
    "this implies that the hadronic phase shifts @xmath17 , obtained from the psa of the @xmath11 data which went hand in hand with the calculation of the electromagnetic corrections , are identified with phase shifts @xmath18 corresponding to total isospin @xmath19 .",
    "they can therefore be used as known input to the psa of the @xmath3 data .",
    "this psa will then yield three new hadronic phase shifts @xmath20 corresponding to @xmath21 .",
    "we therefore assume that there are real symmetric @xmath22 matrices @xmath23 which generalise @xmath24 from the @xmath11 case to the two channel situation : @xmath25 the orthogonal transformation ( [ eq:1 ] ) takes the hadronic @xmath26-matrices from the isospin basis ( in which they are diagonal ) to the physical basis . the isospin invariant mixing angle is @xmath27 and @xmath28 in order to analyse the low energy @xmath3 scattering data it is necessary to calculate electromagnetic correction matrices @xmath29 which , when added to the @xmath23 , give the real symmetric @xmath22 nuclear matrices",
    "@xmath30 : @xmath31 the experimental observables are related to the nuclear partial wave matrices @xmath30 by formulae which are given in section 2 and in eqs.(1,2 ) of ref.@xcite .    for the calculation of the @xmath29 we use the potential model of ref.@xcite in a generalisation to the two - channel case .",
    "we emphasise that the potentials are introduced only in order to calculate the corrections .",
    "in addition to the potentials @xmath32 , which we identify with the effective hadronic potentials @xmath33 for @xmath34 scattering , we have new potentials @xmath35 which are constructed in order to reproduce the phase shifts @xmath20 , using the same rses containing the masses @xmath16 and @xmath14 .",
    "we therefore have @xmath22 effective hadronic potential matrices",
    "@xmath36 which are isospin invariant : @xmath37 the electromagnetic correction matrices are obtained by adding electromagnetic potential matrices @xmath38 to the @xmath36 and then using these total potential matrices in coupled rses that model the physical situation .",
    "full details will be given in section 3 .",
    "the other constraint that we impose on the effective hadronic potential matrices in eq .",
    "( [ eq:3 ] ) is that they be _",
    "energy independent_. this assumption was already made for the hadronic potentials used in the calculations for @xmath39 elastic scattering described in ref .",
    "isospin invariance identifies these as the potentials @xmath40 and we now require the new potentials @xmath41 to be energy independent as well .    as we remarked in ref.@xcite , the hadronic potential matrices in the absence of the electromagnetic interaction",
    "would be different from the effective matrices in its presence .",
    "therefore isospin invariance for the @xmath36 ( eq.([eq:3 ] ) ) is a separate assumption .",
    "however , in the absence of any reliable model results for what happens when the electromagnetic interaction is switched on , in order to analyse the @xmath42 scattering data we have no choice but to make this assumption and to test it by seeing if it is possible to obtain a statistically acceptable fit to the data .",
    "implicit in this assumption is the requirement that the @xmath19 phase shifts for the @xmath43 analysis be fixed at their values from the @xmath39 analysis . to allow the possibility of different ` @xmath19 ' phase shifts here would already introduce the violation of isospin invariance , which is exactly what we wish to avoid if possible . a specific model for this violation",
    "would then be needed for a meaningful psa to be possible , and a modified formalism would need to be used .",
    "we tested the assumption of isospin invariance at the effective hadronic level and of energy independent effective hadronic potentials by first of all analysing only the @xmath42 elastic scattering data , which are far more extensive than the charge exchange data . to anticipate results to be given later",
    ", a psa based on these assumptions gives a fit to the present @xmath43 elastic scattering data that is statistically poor but just acceptable .",
    "if the accumulation of data eventually results in a clearly unacceptable fit , for which there are systematic deviations of the data from the fitted values , this would already be evidence of ` dynamical ' violation of isospin invariance ( that is , beyond the effect of the electromagnetic interaction and the mass differences ) .",
    "the psa and the calculation of the electromagnetic corrections would then need to be reconsidered .",
    "as things stand at present , the data on @xmath44 elastic scattering is _ consistent with _ the assumption of isospin invariance of the effective hadronic interaction and of energy independent hadronic potentials for calculating the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "this does not provide evidence _ for _ these assumptions ; an investigation of the possibility of dynamical violation of isospin invariance requires the study of the data on @xmath43 charge exchange scattering and on pionic hydrogen . some positive evidence from the former",
    "is given in refs.@xcite and @xcite .",
    "we will reconsider all of the evidence in a later paper concerned with a phase shift analysis of low energy @xmath44 scattering data and the comparison of the @xmath0-wave scattering lengths obtained from this analysis and from the position and width of the @xmath45 level of pionic hydrogen .",
    "this paper will complete our study of the pion - nucleon interaction at low energies .",
    "the basic ideas sketched in this introduction will be fully developed in the rest of the paper .",
    "section 2 will set out the formalism for the scattering amplitude matrices in the two - channel case , while section 3 will give the method of calculating the electromagnetic correction matrices for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-waves .",
    "the numerical results for these corrections will be given in section 4 .",
    "we begin by writing the @xmath22 matrices of no - flip and spin - flip scattering amplitudes for the ( @xmath42 , @xmath46 ) system in the form @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 @xmath50 the pieces of @xmath51 are given by eqs.(21 - 23 ) and ( 29 ) of ref.@xcite , with a change of sign in each case .",
    "eqs.([eq:4],[eq:5 ] ) are the obvious generalisations of eqs.(30,31 ) of ref.@xcite .",
    "the matrices @xmath52 , @xmath53 are just @xmath54 where the electromagnetic amplitudes @xmath55 , @xmath56 for @xmath42 scattering have the same decomposition as for @xmath34 scattering , namely @xmath57 @xmath58 the expressions for the components of @xmath55 , @xmath56 are those given in eqs.(7)-(9 ) , ( 18 ) and ( 20 ) of ref.@xcite , with @xmath59 , @xmath60 in eq.(18 ) and a change of sign in the other four amplitudes .",
    "the form factors are unchanged since @xmath61 is the same for @xmath62 and @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath22 matrices @xmath63 of partial wave amplitudes are written most conveniently in the form @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is given by eq.(10 ) of ref.@xcite and @xmath67 is the corresponding c.m .",
    "momentum for the @xmath46 channel , @xmath68[w^2-(m_n+\\mu_0)^2]}{4w^2 }   , \\label{eq:12}\\ ] ] @xmath69 and @xmath70 being the masses of the neutron and @xmath5 respectively . the nuclear matrices @xmath71 in eq.([eq:11 ] ) are those introduced in section 1 .",
    "the expressions ( [ eq:10 ] ) and ( [ eq:11 ] ) , with real symmetric matrices @xmath71 , assume two - channel unitarity , that is the absence of any competing channels .",
    "this is not quite true , since the @xmath72 channel introduces inelastic corrections to the @xmath73 which need to be taken into account . in the energy range @xmath74 mev",
    "these corrections are almost insignificant and it is sufficient to use the results of ref.@xcite , which are derived from known amplitudes for the reactions @xmath75 , @xmath13 using three - channel unitarity .",
    "it is unnecessary to introduce a complex hadronic potential matrix .",
    "the observables for @xmath42 elastic and charge exchange scattering need to be calculated from the partial wave amplitudes @xmath76 , @xmath77 given by eq.([eq:10 ] ) , with @xmath78 , @xmath79 replaced by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , where @xmath82 we have dropped the subscript @xmath83 for convenience and have used the subscripts @xmath84,@xmath85 to denote the channels @xmath42 , @xmath13 respectively .",
    "the nuclear quantities @xmath78 , @xmath79 are calculated from eq.([eq:11 ] ) with the real symmetric matrix @xmath86 given by eq.([eq:1 ] ) .",
    "the corrections @xmath87 , @xmath88 ( for the @xmath0- and @xmath2-waves ) are related to the quantities @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 in table iv of ref.@xcite by the formulae @xmath92 @xmath93    the decomposition of the matrices @xmath71 into a hadronic part @xmath94 and its electromagnetic correction @xmath95 is given in eq.([eq:2 ] ) .",
    "as we have discussed , the matrices @xmath94 refer to an effective hadronic situation which is isospin invariant and in which all the pions have the mass @xmath14 and the nucleons the mass @xmath16 .",
    "the aim of our calculation is to obtain for the @xmath0- , @xmath1- and @xmath2-waves the three independent elements of the symmetric correction matrix @xmath96 .",
    "however , the corrections in this form do not convey information in the way we would naturally like to have it .",
    "it is therefore customary to write the nuclear matrices in the form @xmath97 and to define three new corrections @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 by @xmath101 here @xmath102 is the mixing angle , which we choose to lie between @xmath85 and @xmath103 .",
    "this convention then fixes the labelling of the eigenphases and ensures that @xmath104 is close to @xmath105 ( @xmath106 ) .    to proceed with the calculation of the corrections we need the potential matrices @xmath107 and @xmath108 which appear in the coupled rses that lead to the nuclear matrices @xmath109 .",
    "the effective hadronic potential matrices have the isospin invariant form of eq.([eq:3 ] ) and the potentials @xmath110 ( @xmath111 ) are constructed so as to reproduce the hadronic phase shifts @xmath112 via the rses @xmath113 the phase shifts are given by the asymptotic behaviour @xmath114 of the regular wavefunctions .",
    "the quantities @xmath66 and @xmath115 are defined in eq.(10 ) of ref.@xcite and @xmath116 is the reduced mass of the @xmath3 system .",
    "the electromagnetic potential matrix @xmath117 is @xmath118 and @xmath119 has the decomposition given in eq.(25 ) of ref.@xcite : @xmath120 the full potential matrix is @xmath121 the pieces of @xmath119 in eq.([eq:17 ] ) , and therefore @xmath122 itself , have the opposite sign compared with the case of @xmath34 scattering .",
    "( this is true for @xmath123 since @xmath124 is calculated only to order @xmath125 . ) full details of the parts of @xmath126 were given in section 2 of ref.@xcite .",
    "the partial wave rses for the two - channel case , which we use in order to model the physical situation , are given by the natural generalisation of eq.(34 ) of ref.@xcite : @xmath127 the full potential matrices @xmath128 have the form given in eqs.([eq:3],[eq:18]-[eq:20 ] ) .",
    "the matrices @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are @xmath132 where @xmath67 is defined in eq.(11 ) and @xmath133    the only nonzero entry of the electromagnetic potential term @xmath134 is just @xmath135 , which is the same as for @xmath34 but with the change of sign in @xmath136 .",
    "the particular form @xmath137 of the hadronic potential term , with @xmath138 a real symmetric energy independent matrix satisfying isospin invariance , is crucial for the calculation of the @xmath42 electromagnetic corrections and we need to explain in detail why we chose it in this way .",
    "the issue is how to incorporate the physical mass differences into the two - channel problem .",
    "there is no guidance from the chain of reasoning that starts from the bethe - salpeter equation and proceeds via a three - dimensional reduction to integral equations for the partial wave amplitudes in momentum space , which contain a hadronic quasipotential .",
    "this method has been used for example in ref.@xcite to develop a dynamical model for low energy pion - nucleon scattering .",
    "such a procedure ignores the mass differences and involves delicate issues like the choice of the reduction and the form factors at the vertices of the tree diagrams used .",
    "the partial wave quasipotentials , if converted to coordinate space , are nonlocal and energy dependent . trying to incorporate the electromagnetic interaction and the mass differences into such a model in order to calculate the electromagnetic corrections would be impossible .",
    "since we are dealing with a spin @xmath85- spin @xmath139 system with the fermion much heavier than the boson , we are not far from the static limit and it is natural to look to the klein - gordon equation for guidance . for this equation with the potential @xmath140",
    "there is a simple transformation to an rse with @xmath14 replaced by @xmath141 , the static limit of @xmath142 .",
    "the appendix of ref.@xcite assumes that the hadronic potential enters the klein - gordon equation in the same way as @xmath140 , as the timelike component of a four - vector .",
    "it is then shown that the effective hadronic potential @xmath143 that appears in the resulting rse must also be multiplied by @xmath141 .",
    "however , it is also possible to introduce the hadronic potential as a scalar or as a combination of the two , so the assumption of ref.@xcite , which is also made in the model of low energy pion - nucleon scattering of ref.@xcite , requires further justification . looking at @xmath34 alone can not decide anything , as we said in ref.@xcite , but there is empirical evidence from the ( @xmath42 , @xmath46 ) system for the choice made in refs.@xcite .    at the hadronic level , with mass differences",
    "included , a study of the extrapolation of the invariant amplitudes to the cheng - dashen point favours this choice @xcite ; this provides some justification for the model used in ref.@xcite .",
    "as shown in ref.@xcite , this implies that the hadronic potential term should have the form @xmath137 given in eq.([eq:21 ] ) .",
    "writing this term in full is instructive ; it is @xmath144 it is then clear that introducing the energy dependent factors @xmath115 , @xmath145 is _ not _ equivalent to having nonrelativistic reduced masses @xmath116 , @xmath146 and energy dependent hadronic potentials for each isospin .",
    "the effect of the factors @xmath115 , @xmath145 is large yet subtle ; they change the way in which the violation of isospin invariance due to the mass differences is introduced .",
    "we studied the effect of choosing the hadronic potential term as @xmath147 , _ without _ the factor @xmath131 and with @xmath148 energy independent and isospin invariant .",
    "however , this resulted in large changes to some of the electromagnetic corrections .",
    "the most dramatic effect was on @xmath149 for the @xmath2-wave , which became much smaller ; it changed sign near 70 mev and was @xmath150 at 100 mev , compared with @xmath151 obtained with the choice @xmath152 of the hadronic potential term in eq.([eq:21 ] ) .",
    "the nordita value @xcite at this energy is @xmath153 .",
    "the correction given by the potential model without the factor @xmath131 is therefore completely at variance with that given by nordita",
    ". their calculation did take account of the mass differences , though it is impossible to recover from their references exactly how this was done .    with the electromagnetic corrections calculated using the factor @xmath131 in the hadronic potential term , the value of @xmath154 for the fit to 224 data points for @xmath43 elastic scattering is 471.0 .",
    "when the factor @xmath155 is absent , @xmath156 increases to 484.8 , so the fit becomes worse .",
    "most of the increase comes from the data near 100 mev , where the value of @xmath149 for the @xmath2-wave changes so much when the factor @xmath131 is absent . by the usual statistical criteria ,",
    "both fits are extremely poor , so once again decisive evidence is elusive .",
    "the large values of @xmath156 come from the data base itself . for the fit with the factor",
    "@xmath131 included , there is no evidence of any systematic deviation , with either angle or energy , of the data points from the fitted curves .",
    "the deviations are erratic and it seems clear that in many cases the errors , particularly the systematic errors , have been underestimated . in the sense of giving a reasonable averaging over an internally inconsistent body of data , the fit with the factor",
    "@xmath131 included is certainly better than that where this factor is absent . in summary , we have given three pieces of evidence that favour the inclusion of the specific energy dependence introduced by the factor @xmath131 in the hadronic potential term : the extrapolation of the invariant amplitudes to the cheng - dashen point , the comparison with the results of nordita @xcite ( who also include the mass differences ) and the better fit to the data ( judged not only by the value of @xmath156 but also by the systematic deviation near 100 mev when @xmath131 is not included ) .",
    "we turn now to some calculational details .",
    "the rses ( [ eq:21 ] ) are integrated outwards from @xmath157 to obtain two linearly independent regular solution vectors .",
    "the integration proceeds to a distance @xmath158 ( around 1000 fm ) where the only part of the potential matrix that is not negligible is @xmath140 , which appears in @xmath159 .",
    "the components @xmath160 and @xmath161 of @xmath162 , which contain only linear combinations of the hadronic potential , become negligible beyond distances of a few fm , so the integration as far as @xmath163 is necessary only for the first component of @xmath164 .",
    "the matching at @xmath163 , which leads to the matrix @xmath71 , requires particular attention . in the @xmath42 channel",
    "the matching is to a linear combination of the standard point charge coulomb wavefunctions @xmath165 and @xmath166 and in the @xmath13 channel it is to a linear combination of the free particle wavefunctions @xmath167 and @xmath168 . to make the notation less complicated",
    ", we drop the subscripts @xmath83 and @xmath169 for the moment and form the matrix @xmath170 : @xmath171 where @xmath172 , @xmath173 , are two linearly independent solution vectors . for @xmath174 , @xmath170 has the form @xmath175 where @xmath176 @xmath177 @xmath178 @xmath179    the particular forms of @xmath180 , @xmath181 in eqs.([eq:27 ] , [ eq:28 ] ) arise from the choice of the additive electromagnetic amplitudes @xmath182 , which contain the parts @xmath183 , @xmath184 and @xmath185 , and of the electromagnetic phase shifts @xmath186 , which contain @xmath187 .",
    "this means that , in order to obtain the correct matrices @xmath71 as defined in eq.([eq:10 ] ) , it is necessary to match to the linear combinations of the point charge coulomb wavefunctions given in eqs.([eq:27],[eq:28 ] ) , which correspond to the phase shift @xmath188 .",
    "the nuclear matrices @xmath30 are given by @xmath189 the factor @xmath190 in eq.([eq:25 ] ) appears naturally if one works with a symmetric matrix @xmath86 , as shown in section 3 of ref.@xcite .",

    "inspection of the rses in eq.([eq:21 ] ) shows that the electromagnetic corrections may be separated into two parts , one due to the inclusion of @xmath199 as an addition to @xmath200 ( eq.([eq:20 ] ) ) and the other due to the difference between the masses of the particles in the two channels ( @xmath201 , @xmath202 , @xmath203 ) .",
