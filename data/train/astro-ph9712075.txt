    "one of the results coming out of the first hydrodynamic simulations of the low column density ly@xmath0 forest ( @xmath1 ) is that the predicted column density distribution ( we will denote by @xmath2 ) roughly agrees with observations ( [ @xcite],[@xcite ] , [ @xcite ] & [ @xcite ] ) . because of the limited number of cosmological models simulated then , it was unclear if the agreement is coincidental or a generic prediction of a large class of models .",
    "subsequent analytic / semi - analytic work using the lognormal approximation for the density field ( [ @xcite ] & [ @xcite ] ) predicts that @xmath2 s for a large class of models are very similar .",
    "it is later shown by [ @xcite ] that 1 .",
    "the lognormal approximation does not predict @xmath2 accurately when compared with the result of a hydrodynamic simulation , although it provides useful physical insights ; 2 .",
    "the zeldovich approximation ( za hereafter ) , which has been widely tested and used in studies of large scale structure [ @xcite ] , works better . in addition , it is pointed out that the slope of @xmath2 depends on both the normalization and slope of the power spectrum , and , using the za , it is predicted that cosmological models with less small scale power would have a steeper @xmath2 .",
    "we review arguments that lead to this conclusion , discuss the possible pitfalls , and summarize the latest progress .",
    "one starts with the following picture of the forest : each ly@xmath0 line is associated with a local maximum or a peak in the neutral hydrogen density .",
    "the column density for a given peak is : @xmath3_{\\rm peak } \\label{nhi}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is the proper distance along the line of sight , @xmath5 is the proper density of @xmath6 , and the symbol @xmath7_{\\rm peak}$ ] denotes evaluation at the peak .",
    "@xmath8 is the width of the peak defined by @xmath9}}$ ] .",
    "the above equation can be derived by replacing @xmath5 under the integral by @xmath10 $ ] and performing a gaussian integration after taylor expanding @xmath11 to second order .",
    "@xmath5 is proportional to the underlying baryon or gas density @xmath12 raised to some power , which depends on the reionization history [ @xcite ] .",
    "@xmath13 is then a simple function of the peak height in @xmath12 and its second derivative @xmath14 which determines the peak width .",
    "hence , @xmath2 , which is the number of absorption lines per unit @xmath13 per unit redshift , is a statistic of density peaks : the number density of peaks with a given combination of peak height and width .",
    "such a statistic can be computed using the method of [ @xcite ] .",
    "it turns out that for the low column density ly@xmath0 forest ( @xmath1 ) , the relevant overdensity @xmath15 is of the order of unity .",
    "the za is known to work well for such a quasilinear density field , and it can be shown generally that the gaussian nature of the za displacement field implies the slope of @xmath2 depends on the normalization and slope of the primordial power spectrum [ @xcite ] .",
    "we will not discuss the dependence on the power spectrum slope in detail here , because its effect is smaller than that of the normalization , and also because the arguments leading to it are more intricate .",
    "the interested reader is referred to [ @xcite ] .",
    "the effect of the power spectrum normalization is simple to understand : let us compare two models , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with @xmath16 having more power on the relevant scales ( see next sec . ) than @xmath17 . *",
    "model @xmath17 , because it has less power , and so has a less nonlinear density field , would have proportionally fewer high peaks compared to low peaks . *",
    "now , @xmath13 depends on both the peak height and width ( eq . [ nhi ] ) , but it turns out that the peak width is correlated with peak height in such a way that a larger peak height also means higher @xmath13 .",
    "therefore , @xmath17 , having fewer high peaks compared to low peaks , also has fewer high @xmath13 lines compared to low ones , hence a steeper @xmath2 .",
    "we illustrate this in fig . 1 where the cdm model plays the role of @xmath16 and the chdm model that of @xmath17 . also shown in the plot",
    "is a comparison of the za @xmath18 peak - counting prediction with the result of hydrodynamic - simulation @xmath18 voigt - profile - fitting for the cdm model .",
    "the agreement is encouraging .",
    "let us examine a few caveats to the above arguments , and discuss some recent work which has bearing on these issues .",
    "first , the peak - counting is done in real space , whereas the absorption lines are observed in velocity space .",
    "a plausible support for our procedure comes from a test in [ @xcite ] where @xmath2 s are computed for two sets of spectra , one generated with non - zero peculiar velocities , and the other with vanishing ones .",
    "they agree with each other well .",
    "moreover , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ nhi ] ) that for an isolated peak , the velocity structure plays no role in determining @xmath13 .",
    "it is interesting to note that there is a recent paper in which peak - counting is done directly in velocity space [ @xcite ] .",
    "second , when using the za , smoothing has to be applied to the initial displacement field to minimize the amount of orbit - crossing by the time of interest .",
    "there is a well - tested prescription for the optimal dark matter smoothing scale , which we call the orbit - crossing scale [ @xcite ] .",
    "another relevant smoothing scale is roughly the jeans length , which specifies the scale on which the baryon density is smoothed with respect to the dark matter density [ @xcite ] .",
    "it turns out that both are of the order of @xmath19 , which makes the ly@xmath0 forest interesting , because it constrains the power spectrum on these scales which are smaller than those probed by galaxy surveys .",
    "the procedure adopted in [ @xcite ] is to smooth the initial displacement field on either the orbit - crossing or the jeans scale , whichever is larger . however , while the jeans - smoothing is physically motivated in the sense it is meant to model the effect of finite gas pressure , the other smoothing is more of a corrective measure to deal with the inaccuracy of the za after orbit - crossing .",
    "it is a legitimate concern whether such smoothing erases structures that might contribute significantly to @xmath20 .",
    "the test against a hydrodynamic simulation shown in fig .",
    "1 lends support to the use of the smoothed za .",
    "however , this might be a lucky coincidence .",
    "further tests are needed .",
    "third , there is no guarantee that in current structure formation models , a given peak in optical depth has exactly the voigt - profile shape , and so standard profile - fitting algorithms might result in one single peak being fitted by several small profiles , which means the association of the one single peak with one absorption line is not exact .",
    "the average effect on @xmath2 is hard to predict analytically , and has to be checked through simulations .",
    "let us now turn to the latest work that has bearing on the above issues .    in two separate pieces of work presented in this conference ( [ @xcite ] & [ @xcite ] )",
    ", it is shown using new hydrodynamic simulations that the slope of @xmath21 is roughly the same for several cosmological models ( of the order of @xmath22 for each ) .",
    "this might indicate the third worry mentioned above is justified : that the nature of the voigt - profile fitting procedure might conspire to result in the same @xmath21 for different models , contrary to what would be expected using a peak - counting method",
    ".    however , it could also be the case that the models simulated above do not span a large enough range ( or have small enough small - scale power ) to allow one to see the effect on @xmath21 .",
    "a different line of attack is developed in [ @xcite ] , in which the ly@xmath0 forest is simulated using a pm code , with the poisson solver modified to compute an effective potential due to pressure in addition to that due to gravity .",
    "a related approach is advocated by [ @xcite ] .",
    "this method produces results in good agreement with hydrodynamic simulations for the low @xmath13 ly@xmath0 forest .",
    "it avoids the problem of the uncertain smoothing scale for the za .",
    "it also allows simulations of a large number of models with relatively modest computer expense .",
    "this is undertaken by [ @xcite ] , who finds appreciable differences in the slope of @xmath21 among a set of @xmath23 cosmological models , and concludes the normalization of the power spectrum at a particular scale can indeed be constrained by @xmath21 , confirming the prediction of [ @xcite ] .",
    "it is also shown that the peak - counting method in real space compares favorably with voigt - profile - fitting as a way of finding @xmath21 .",
    "however , a few caveats have to be kept in mind .",
    "first , in [ @xcite ] , only a narrow range of @xmath13 ( @xmath24 ) is used to arrive at the above conclusions .",
    "second , the correction introduced due to the finite box size should be checked using larger simulations .",
    "third , the observed @xmath21 that the theoretical predictions are compared against is obtained using a different profile - fitting algorithm from the one discussed in [ @xcite ] . in general , the proper error - analysis is probably highly algorithm - dependent , when one attempts to use the observed @xmath21 to constrain the power spectrum .      # 1 [ 1 ] hui , l. , gnedin , n. y. & zhang , y. 1997 , , 486 , 599 [ 2 ] cen , r. , miralda - escud , j. , ostriker , j. p. & rauch , m. 1994 , , 437 , 9 [ 3 ] zhang , y. , anninos , p. & norman , m. l. 1995 , , 453 , l57 [ 4 ] hernquist , l. , katz , n. , weinberg , d. h. & miralda - escud , j. 1995 , , 457 , l51 [ 5 ] miralda - escud , j. , cen , r. , ostriker , j. p. & rauch , m. 1996 , , 471 , 582 [ 6 ] bi , h. g. & davidsen , a. f. 1997 , , 479 , 523 [ 7 ] gnedin , n. y. & hui , l. 1996 , , 472 , l73 [ 8 ] coles , p. , melott , a. l. & shandarin , s. f. 1993 , , 260 , 765 [ 9 ] hui , l. , gnedin , n. y. 1996 , preprint , astro - ph 9612232 [ 10 ] bardeen , j. m. , bond , j. r. , kaiser , n. & szalay , a. s. 1986 , , 304 , 15 [ 11 ] hui , l. & rutledge , r. e. 1997 , preprint , astro - ph 9709100 [ 12 ] gnedin , n. y. & hui , l. 1997 , preprint , astro - ph 9706219 [ 13 ] dav , r. 1997 , contribution to this volume [ 14 ] bond , j. r. & wadsley , j. w. 1997 , contribution to this volume [ 15 ] petitjean , p. , mcket , j. p. & kates , r. e. 1995 ,  , 295 , l9 [ 16 ] gnedin , n. y. 1997 , preprint , astro - ph 9706286 [ 17 ] hui , l , gnedin , n. y. & zhang , y. 1996 , proc .",
