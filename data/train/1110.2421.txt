    "the three neutral higgs bosons are collectively called as @xmath6 . at the tree level , higgs sector of the mssm are controlled by two parameters , which are the mass of the cp - odd higgs bosons @xmath7 , and the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , tan @xmath8 . the neutral bosons decay into @xmath9 and @xmath10 pairs with branching fractions @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",

    "searches with @xmath9 pair have other advantages that they are not suppressed with huge multijet and large di - jet background . moreover , neutral higgs production in association with b quarks has the advantage to use the information of tagged b quarks to suppress irreducible @xmath13+jets background .",
