    "we constructed an explicit example , based on the orbifold @xmath34 , to illustrate the effects of spatial noncommutativity in 6d qed with fermions confined to an orbifold fixed point .",
    "notably , we find new three- and four - point couplings involving kk excitations of the photon , exclusively .",
    "since all fields involved in these interactions have tev - scale masses , we confirm that collider signals are most promising at a vlhc , rather than at the lhc .",
    "in particular , we find order 100% corrections to the three - body decays @xmath177 and to the pair production @xmath178 , with @xmath179 .",
    "the former might be discernible at a vlhc , if one is lucky with model parameters , and yield a strikingly different @xmath125 sum energy spectrum then if the noncommutative interactions are absent .",
    "pair production has a better chance of yielding a statistically significant excess for tev - scale kk masses .",
    "observing order 100% corrections to the production of certain pairs of kk modes at a vlhc while finding no corrections to others would provide a clear signal of noncommutativity in the bulk .",
