    "if agb stars can efficiently produce dust at any metallicity as the dustings data suggests , it follows that the dust - to - gas ratios ( dgrs ) in the ( c - rich ) stellar envelopes may be similar at all metallicities when the stars are in the dust - producing `` superwind '' phase @xcite .",
    "this implies that the dgr in the interstellar medium ( ism ) should also be independent of metallicity if agb stars are the dominant source of interstellar dust and dust grains are minimally processed after leaving the circumstellar envelope .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies show a clear correlation between metallicity and dgr in the ism ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the remnants of grain destruction / shattering may then provide the seeds for grain accretion in molecular clouds .",

    "these include 4 known c stars in the very metal - poor galaxy sagdig ( @xmath2 } = -2.1 $ ] ) , which we have found to be the most metal - poor confirmed dust - producing c stars known .",
    "the 2-epoch minimum amplitudes of the variable x - agb candidates indicate an increase in amplitude with color , supporting a link between dust production and pulsation .",
    "the mean amplitudes show no variation with metallicity .",
    "we use the @xmath0-[4.5]$ ] color to estimate the dust - production rates of the x - agb candidates , and we find that the mean dust - production rate among the x - agb stars within any galaxy is independent of metallicity .",
    "this trend holds even when including the large and small magellanic clouds , suggesting that dust production occurs in c stars with similar efficiency at any metallicity down to at least @xmath1 } = -2.2 $ ] .",
    "the maximum dust - production rate within a given galaxy may show a trend with metallicity . however , this trend is more likely due to a sample bias wherein the most massive galaxies that are more likely to contain the rarest dusty sources are also the galaxies with the highest metallicities .",
