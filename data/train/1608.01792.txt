    "metamaterials , as synthetic composite materials with a structure such that they exhibit properties not usually found in natural materials , now form a major emerging research area that barely existed before 2000 ; in fact , the term `` metamaterial '' itself was first used in 1999 . since then",
    ", the area has grown extensively and shows little sign of slowing down .",
    "the key point is that materials can be designed to have , say , a negative refractive index as predicted by  @xcite and later by@xcite ; and subsequently fabricated by @xcite , which is impossible in naturally occurring materials .",
    "the first metamaterials were developed in optics and electromagnetism and relied upon having simultaneously negative permittivity and permeability , this was made physically possible using a microstructured periodic medium consisting of sub - wavelength resonators such as split - ring resonators @xcite .",
    "it has subsequently been realised that these ideas can also be profitably utilised to create acoustic or elastic ( negative density and negative shear or bulk modulus ) metamaterials @xcite . similarly , although metamaterials were initially developed for bulk media , one can also create microstructured surfaces that act as metasurfaces @xcite with , again , most of the activity centered around electromagnetic waves and surface plasmons .",
    "given that the array of resonators we introduce here modifies the surface wave properties we choose to call this a metasurface rather than a metamaterial although there is no strict definition , as yet .",
    "much more recently seismic metamaterials have begun to be considered , although here the challenges are substantial : not only are the rayleigh waves , which are of primary interest , surface waves , but the underlying system of equations are the full vector equations of elasticity .",
    "nonetheless there have been attempts to modify the local properties of the ground through the addition of inclusions , or resonators , of a different material at a sub - wavelength scale .",
    "the different types of inclusions , resonant or non - resonant , determine the properties and the performance of the structured medium or metamaterial/ metasurface . turning to the non - resonant case first",
    ", @xcite show with both large - scale experiments and theory that the soil properties can be critically affected by periodic arrangements of boreholes with a spacing of about a metre ; in the bragg scattering regime these induce bandgaps that can be used for seismic protection .",
    "more recently , resonant sub - wavelength scatterers placed on top of an elastic substrate have been investigated and we are motivated by recent geophysical experiments @xcite that have demonstrated that natural forest trees can act as a metasurface for frequencies between 30 and 100 hz .",
    "quite remarkably these experiments show a distinct reduction in the transmission of waves over a broad range of frequencies ; these frequencies appear to lie in bandgaps created by local resonances between trees and elastic waves in the substrate .",
    "these large - scale experiments can be interpreted through laboratory - scale experiments and theory @xcite that have , for simplicity , utilised elastic plates , not the full elastic system ; notably , these papers neglect the flexural deformations of the resonators .",
    "in contrast , in the present paper , we account for both the flexural and compressional deformations of the resonators and demonstrate that the flexural resonances significantly impact the spectrum of the metamaterial in certain regimes .",
    "although we have focused upon the geophysical setting , elastic waves are also very important in ultrasonics and surface acoustic wave devices , and the bragg scattering aspects of surface arrays as phononic crystals have been explored , i.e. , in , say , @xcite .",
    "locally resonant structures have also been shown to give rise to so - called _ super - wide pseudo - directional _ band gaps in platonic crystals  @xcite ; such band gaps are formed by the coalescence of bragg and resonance band gaps .    given the interest in this emerging area , and the developing applications such as surface to bulk elastic wave filters @xcite , there is a need for the fundamental solutions to canonical problems involving periodic arrays of sub - wavelength resonators atop elastic substrates . here",
    "we provide the required analytical and theoretical background for these seismic metasurfaces by considering arrays of these resonators attached to elastic substrates , thereby considering the interaction with elastic rayleigh waves and for comparison and completeness we also consider the elastic plate .",
    "we do so in a two - dimensional setting as the essential concepts are uncluttered by excessive algebra , and the solutions we obtain allow for interpretation and are , on occasion , completely explicit .",
    "the mathematical tools for treating periodic arrays are extensive : linear partial differential operators , quasi - periodic green s functions , and integral transforms based upon fourier series and we use a variety of these approaches freely to obtain the cleanest solutions ; these theoretical approaches are complimented by illustrative numerical calculations based on the spectral element method .",
    "we begin in section [ sec : plates ] by considering the array of resonators attached to an elastic plate , this is complementary to @xcite , and we obtain explicit dispersion relations and explore the relative importance of flexural and compressional resonances in the array and how they interact with the plate waves .",
    "this naturally leads in the full elastic situation of an array atop an elastic half - space , section [ sec : full_elastic ] investigates this and again explicit results emerge that are used to interpret and predict metamaterial / metasurface phenomena .",
    "finally , we draw together some concluding remarks in section [ sec : conclude ] .",

    "these curves correspond to combinations of frequency , @xmath11 , and wavenumber , @xmath73 , for which a surface waves exists ; that is , waves that propagate over the surface of the half - space and decay exponentially into the bulk .",
    "these waves arise as a result of the periodicity of the array present on the boundary of the half - space and are distinct from the usual rayleigh waves that exist on free surfaces ; it is natural , therefore , to refer to such waves as rayleigh - bloch waves  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the dispersion curves , we also indicate the compressional resonances of the resonators , shown as the horizontal dashed lines in figure  [ fig : half - plane - disp ] .",
    "the remaining dashed lines of increasing slope are the curves corresponding to rayleigh waves , bulk shear waves , and bulk compressional waves in the homogeneous elastic half - space respectively ; we call these dispersion lines the rayleigh / shear / compressional wave sound - line by analogy with the terminology used in electromagnetism ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) .    previous investigations of similar systems were based on purely numerical simulations  @xcite ; with the dispersion equation   in hand , we can now examine several interesting features of the dispersion curves offering additional physical insight . as noted in the earlier papers  @xcite on elastic plates and from the numerical simulations of @xcite for a half - space ,",
    "the onset of band gaps coincide with the longitudinal resonances of the resonators . here",

    "thus , in this regime where the pass bands are bounded from below by the resonances of the resonators and from above by the intersections of the dispersion curves with the shear sound - line , the band gaps have a constant width defined by @xmath78 .",
    "\\label{eq : elastic - band - width}\\ ] ] since @xmath79 , the argument of @xmath80 in equation   is real and positive ; hence @xmath81 and therefore band gaps always exist for finite parameters .",
    "equation   provides a convenient formula for tuning the width of the band gap : in order to maximise the band gap , the factor @xmath82 and the argument of @xmath80 in   should be made as small as possible simultaneously .",
    "the converse will minimise the width of the stop band . in rough terms , short resonators with high compressional wave - speeds",
    "will maximise the stop band width .",
    "however , as the material parameters of the resonators also appear in the argument of @xmath80 , some care is required when tuning the system .",
    "thus far we have studied infinite periodic structures .",
    "however , metamaterials , metasurfaces , and phononic structures often find application as filters , lenses , and polarisers . as has been shown in the electromagnetic  @xcite , elastodynamic  @xcite , and thin plate  @xcite literature , the dispersive properties of an infinite system can be used to design finite structures that posses interesting properties such as negative refraction , flat lenses , filtering , and cloaking .",
    "to illustrate the potential of rayleigh waves in this regard , we consider their interaction with a finite array of resonators .    to this end , and given that we are concerned with the control of surface waves on elastic bodies , the intersection of the dispersion curves with the rayleigh wave sound - line for an homogeneous elastic half - space without resonators ( indicated by the blue dot on figure  [ fig : half - plane - disp ] ) is of interest . for combinations of wavenumber and frequency corresponding to this point of intersection , a rayleigh wave incident on the array of resonators from the elastic half - space can generate a rayleigh - bloch wave , that is a surface wave whose behaviour is affected by the periodicity , in the array .",
    "conversely , at this point , a rayleigh - bloch wave leaving the array can couple into a pure rayleigh wave in the ambient half - space . with the exception of embedded surface waves , which we do not consider here , the homogeneous half - space does not support localised rayleigh waves corresponding to points above the rayleigh wave sound - line ; in practical terms , this means that the region between the lower red dot and the blue dot on figure  [ fig : half - plane - disp ] is an `` effective stop band '' for rayleigh waves incident on the array from a homogeneous half - space .    the point of intersection between the dispersion curves and the rayleigh sound - line can be obtained from   by setting @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the rayleigh wave speed ( see  @xcite , among others ) .",

    "are specified in table  [ tab : elastic - parameters ] .",
    "the simulations are performed with specfem2d @xcite , a well known parallel code widely used by the seismological community .",
    "the mesh is constructed using quadrilateral elements and the commercial software cubit .",
    "perfectly matched layers  @xcite ( pml ) are applied on the bottom and vertical boundaries of the computational domain containing the half - space ; the remaining boundaries ( top surface and resonators ) are traction free .",
    "the accuracy of this method has been thoroughly tested in a previous study  @xcite against experimental measurements .",
    "thus far we have considered an infinite array of resonators , however for the numerical simulations ( figs .",
    "[ fig : half - line - fig1 ] and  [ fig : half - line - fig2 ] ) , a large , finite , number is more convenient .",
    "we take an array of 30 resonators and place a point source 60 m away on the surface of the half - space , as shown in figure [ fig : half - line - fig0 ] .",
    "the source takes the form of a sinusoidal vertical force of angular frequency @xmath11 . to avoid spurious effects at the onset of time",
    ", the amplitude of the sinusoidal force is initially modulated by a ramp function that progressively increases in amplitude over the first eight periods ( see the inset of figure  [ fig : half - line - fig0 ] ) , @xmath88 the distance between the source and the resonant array is such that only rayleigh waves scatter on the resonators ( e.g. figs .",
    "[ fig : half - line - fig1 ] and  [ fig : half - line - fig2 ] ) ; the remaining classes of waves are absorbed by the pml .",
    "once the ramp function has reached its final value , the simulations continue in a stationary state where only a monochromatic signal with constant amplitude propagates . the snapshots in figs .  [",
    "fig : half - line - fig1 ] and [ fig : half - line - fig2 ] have been taken when the simulation is in this regime .",
    "figures  [ fig : half - line - fig1 ] and  [ fig : half - line - fig2 ] demonstrate the metamaterial properties of the resonant array in various regimes . here",
    "we have chosen not to present the deformation of the resonators in order to highlight the wavefield in the half - space ; the full videos associated with these figures are provided in the supplementary materials ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : half - line - fig1]c shows the transmission of a surface wave through the array at a frequency corresponding to the lower branch of the dispersion curves , figure  [ fig : half - line - fig1]a .",
    "we also note the decrease in wavelength inside the array corresponding to the slower effective wavespeed inside the metasurface as compared with the homogeneous half - space .",
    "the shorter wavelength is accompanied by an increase in amplitude of the waves inside the array as well as an increased rate of decay into the bulk .",
    "in contrast , figure  [ fig : half - line - fig1]b shows the case when the frequency of the incident wave almost coincides with a resonance of the resonators leading to virtually no transmission .    moving on to figure  [ fig : half - line - fig2 ] , the two panels ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to the second branch of the dispersion curves , as indicated .",
    "it is important to note that this upper branch transitions from the rayleigh sound - line to the shear sound - line , that is , the rayleigh - bloch wave in the resonant array preserves the rayleigh - like surface wave properties at higher frequencies but will evolve into a shear - like wave as the frequency decreases .",
    "the hybrid nature of this branch , sitting between the shear and rayleigh sound - lines , is responsible for the mode conversion of rayleigh waves into shear waves and used in the design of so - called resonant _ metawedge _",
    "systems @xcite .    the point of intersection ( marked in red ) between the hybrid branch and the shear sound - line is of particular interest .",
    "at this frequency , waves can propagate past the metasurface but they must only do so as shear waves ( note the polarization ) as is illustrated in figure  [ fig : half - line - fig2](c ) for a frequency very close to this point . in this regime the transition between rayleigh waves propagating in the free half - space ( to the right hand side of the array ) and the hybrid mode in the array happens abruptly resulting in an  apparent bandgap \" for surface waves .",
    "therefore the wavefield beneath the resonators , represented in figure  [ fig : half - line - fig2](c ) , is characterised by shear waves that propagate away from the surface and into the bulk leaving the left hand side of the array almost untouched . as the frequency increases ( figure  [ fig : half - line - fig2](b ) ) the wavefield reveals more clearly its hybrid nature .",
    "the waves propagating under the resonators are grazing the surface but they are not yet exponentially decaying as rayleigh waves . in this regime waves can propagate in the resonator but the transmission is still weak .",
    "the hybrid mode progressively turns into a rayleigh wave as the frequency increases toward the crossing point ( blue dot in figure  [ fig : half - plane - disp ] ) .",
    "metamaterials barely existed fifteen years ago , but now form a major research area : although initially developed for optics , the field of metamaterial research has expanded rapidly and now includes the development of novel materials for applications in acoustics and elasticity .",
    "more recently , the applicability of metamaterials to seismology has sparked the interest of geophysicists in the development of novel methods to control surface waves . given the interest in this emerging area ,",
    "there is a need to study the properties of the solutions to fundamental canonical problems .    in this paper",
    "we have provided the theoretical and analytical framework necessary for the rigorous study of these seismic metasurfaces that adjust the surface wave behaviour .",
    "the framework is introduced through the study of two canonical problems associated with the control of mechanical surface waves .",
    "initially , we study the propagation of surface bloch waves through an array of resonators on a thin elastic plate . in this case",
    ", the resonators are thin elastic rods supporting both compressional and flexural waves .",
    "explicit exact solutions are developed and used to examine the behaviour of the system .",
    "in particular , we study the coupling between the symmetric and anti - symmetric modes in the substrate and the resonances of the rods .",
    "interestingly it is found that , in the frequency range of interest and for sufficiently rigid plates , the flexural resonances of the resonators couple very weakly into the substrate with the dominant effect coming from the compressional modes of resonators , which open up band gaps associated with the compressional resonances . for more flexible plates , the flexural deformations of the resonators become important .",
    "the plate system is used as the motivation for the far more challenging problem considered in section  [ sec : full_elastic ] where we examine the propagation of surface bloch waves through an array of resonators resting on a fully - elastic half - space . here",
    "we develop closed form expressions for the dispersion equation and wave - fields in the deep sub - wavelength regime of interest . as for the plate problem , the compressional resonances of the resonators create band gaps in the dispersion curves and analytical expressions for their position and width are provided . in particular , it is shown that band gaps will always exist regardless of the material or geometrical parameters of the half - space and resonators . the notion of `` effective band gaps '' for surface waves",
    "is also introduced and discussed .    in section  [ sec : full_elastic ] , we also examine the scattering problem associated with a half - line of resonators and use the dispersive properties of the array to examine , the filtering effects of the resonant array .    with",
    "the formal framework of seismic metasurfaces now established , the time is ripe to exploit these results and explore the possibilities of extending the existing results for electromagnetism and acoustics to seismology .",
    "indeed , the theoretical framework developed in the present paper is already being used in the design and development of the so - called _ meta - wedge _ that is capable of mode - converting destructive seismic surface waves into mainly harmless bulk shear waves  @xcite .",

    "<S> we consider the canonical problem of an array of rods , which act as resonators , placed on an elastic substrate ; the substrate being either a thin elastic plate or an elastic half - space . in both cases the flexural plate , or rayleigh surface , waves in the substrate interact with the resonators to create interesting effects such as effective band - gaps for surface waves or filters that transform surface waves into bulk waves ; these effects have parallels in the field of optics where such sub - wavelength resonators create metamaterials , and metasurfaces , in the bulk and at the surface respectively .    here </S>",
    "<S> we carefully analyse this canonical problem by extracting the dispersion relations analytically thereby examining the influence of both the flexural and compressional resonances on the propagating wave . for an array of resonators atop an elastic half - space </S>",
    "<S> we augment the analysis with numerical simulations . amongst other effects </S>",
    "<S> , we demonstrate the striking effect of a dispersion curve that transitions from rayleigh wave - like to shear wave - like behaviour and the resultant change in displacement from surface to bulk waves .    </S>",
