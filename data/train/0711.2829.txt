    "in @xcite we observed that the scaling exponent of the energy spectrum of the two - dimensional ( 2d ) navier - stokes-@xmath0 model ( ns-@xmath0 ) , for wavenumbers @xmath1 such that @xmath2 , is @xmath3 . _ a posteriori _",
    ", we saw that this scaling corresponding to that predicted by assuming that the dynamics for @xmath2 was governed by the characteristic time scale for flux of the conserved enstrophy .",
    "we were therefore led to speculate that ( in general ) the unknown scaling exponent for any @xmath0-model may be predicted by the dynamical time scales for the dominant conserved quantity for that model in the regime @xmath2 . in this paper , we present new numerical simulations of the 2d leray-@xmath0 model which support this hypothesis .",
    "we measure the scaling of the energy spectra from simulations of two - dimensional flow , performed at a resolution of @xmath5 , in the limit as @xmath6 , for two models : the ns-@xmath0 model @xcite @xmath7 and the leray-@xmath0 model @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the unsmoothed velocity , smoothed velocity and the pressure respectively for the leray-@xmath0 model and we use  @xmath12   to distinguish the variables in the ns-@xmath0 model ; @xmath13 is the viscosity , and @xmath14 is the body force .",
    "notice that the two systems above reduce to navier - stokes equations ( nse ) when @xmath15 .",
    "one can think of the parameter @xmath0 as the length scale associated with the width of the filter which smooths @xmath9 ( or @xmath16 ) to obtain @xmath10 ( or @xmath17 ) .",
    "the filter is associated with the green s function ( bessel potential ) of the helmholtz operator @xmath18 .",
    "we supplement both of the systems above with periodic boundary conditions in a basic box @xmath19 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the inviscid and unforced version of the three - dimensional ( 3d ) ns-@xmath0 was introduced in @xcite based on the hamilton variational principle subject to the incompressibility constraint @xmath20 . by adding the viscous term @xmath21 and the forcing @xmath14 in an _ ad hoc _ fashion",
    ", the authors in @xcite and @xcite obtain the ns-@xmath0 system which they named , at the time , the viscous camassa - holm equations ( vche ) , also known as the lagrangian averaged navier - stokes-@xmath0 model ( lans-@xmath0 ) . in references  @xcite it was found that the analytical steady state solutions for the 3d ns-@xmath0 model compared well with averaged experimental data from turbulent flows in channels and pipes for wide range of large reynolds numbers .",
    "it was this fact which led the authors of @xcite to suggest that the ns-@xmath0 model be used as a closure model for the reynolds averaged equations .",
    "since then , it has been found that there is in fact a whole family of ` @xmath0'- models which provide similar successful comparison with empirical data  among these are the clark-@xmath0 model @xcite , the leray-@xmath0 model @xcite , the modified leray-@xmath0 model @xcite and the simplified bardina model @xcite ( see also @xcite for a family of similar models ) .",
    "the 3d ns-@xmath0 model was tested numerically in @xcite and @xcite , for moderate reynolds number in a simulation of size @xmath22 , with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it was observed that the large scale features of a turbulent flow were indeed captured and there was a roll over of the energy spectrum from @xmath23 for @xmath24 to something steeper for @xmath25 , although the scaling ranges were insufficient to enable extraction of the power law unambiguously .",
    "other numerical tests of the ns-@xmath0 model were performed in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , with similar results .    in the limit as @xmath26 , we call the two equations ns-@xmath27 @xcite and leray-@xmath27 , respectively , where the forcing term on both models are rescaled appropriately to avoid trivial dynamics . the equations for the ns-@xmath27 and leray-@xmath27",
    "are exactly the equations ( [ nsa ] ) and ( [ leray - a ] ) together with the incompressibility condition except that equations ( [ rel - n ] ) and ( [ rel - l ] ) are replaced by the equations @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . under the assumption that the scaling of the spectrum as @xmath6 is identical to the scaling in the range @xmath25 for finite ( small ) @xmath0 and sufficiently long scaling ranges , we obtain a high resolution numerical calculation of the sub-@xmath0 scales .",
    "this assumption was verified in the finite @xmath0 calculation of the ns-@xmath0 model for two - dimensions in @xcite .",
    "we stress again here , that one has to rescale the forcing appropriately in order to avoid trivial dynamics for large values of @xmath30 , and decaying turbulence at the limit when @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "let @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the typical smoothed and unsmoothed velocities of an eddy of size  @xmath34 for the leray-@xmath0 model .",
    "similarly , let @xmath35 and @xmath36 denote the typical smoothed and unsmoothed velocities of an eddy of size  @xmath34 for the ns-@xmath0 model .",
    "such ` typical ' velocities may be defined by the energy per unit area in the shell @xmath37 as we will show in the next section . from our simulations of 2d ns-@xmath27 in @xcite , the energy spectrum of the smoothed velocity @xmath38 scales as @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we will show from numerical simulations that the energy spectrum of the smoothed velocity @xmath10 of the 2d leray-@xmath27 model scales as @xmath4 .",
    "these scalings can also be derived analytically ( see @xcite and section [ nsavsleray ] below ) under the assumption that an eddy of size @xmath34 , for @xmath2 , has a typical time scale comparable to the inverse of the square root of the enstrophy contained in this eddy .",
    "that is , the dominant direct cascading quantity , which is the enstrophy in the 2d ns-@xmath0 and leray-@xmath0 , dictates these typical time scales .",
    "specifically , under this assumption , the governing time scales for an eddy of size @xmath34 in each model are given by @xmath39 ( for ns-@xmath0 ) and @xmath40 ( for leray-@xmath0 ) .",
    "we assert that the difference in the dominant forward cascading conserved quantities in these two models is what leads to the different power laws . our numerical results in 2d for two different @xmath0-models , with different forward cascading conserved quantities , support this assertion .",
    "based on our studies in 2d , we extrapolate our conclusions to the 3d case as follows . for the 3d ns-@xmath0 model and 3d leray-@xmath0 model ,",
    "the governing time scales for an eddy of size  @xmath34 , for @xmath2 , must be given by @xmath41 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "this is because the energy conserved ( in the absence of forcing and viscosity ) in the 3d ns-@xmath0 is given by @xmath43 while in the 3d leray-@xmath0 it is given by @xmath44 .",
    "accordingly , we assert that for @xmath2 , the energy spectra of the smoothed velocity fields in the 3d case will scale as @xmath45 ( steeper than @xmath46 as originally suggested in @xcite ) for the 3d ns-@xmath0 , and as @xmath47 ( steeper than @xmath48 proposed in @xcite ) for the 3d leray-@xmath0 model .",
    "this assertion is yet to be confirmed computationally in future work .",
    "our prediction of @xmath47 power law for the smoothed energy spectrum of the 3d leray-@xmath0 model corresponds to one of the three candidate power laws derived in @xcite .",
    "the idea that the average velocity of an eddy of size of the order @xmath34 can be evaluated in three different ways , which will then lead to three different power laws , was in fact first introduced in @xcite .    throughout the paper",
    "we denote by @xmath49 the characteristic time scale of an eddy of size @xmath34 , @xmath50 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "we denote the rough and smoothed vorticities by @xmath51 ( or  @xmath52 ) and @xmath53 ( or @xmath54 ) , respectively .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ nsavsleray ]",
    "we derive the power laws for the 2d leray-@xmath0 model and then give a comparison to the corresponding power laws of the 2d ns-@xmath0 equations . in section [ results ] , we give a brief review of the numerical results in @xcite and then present our numerical results for the 2d leray-@xmath0 . in the last section ,",
    "we give a summary of our main results and give a brief description of how this study can help us predict the unknown power laws for the 3d ns-@xmath0 and 3d leray-@xmath0 equations .",
    "as mentioned above , our predictions , based on this study , on the power laws for the two models just mentioned , are different from those suggested in @xcite . in those works , the @xmath46 and @xmath48 power laws for the 3d ns-@xmath0 and 3d leray-@xmath0 model , respectively , were proposed under the assumption that the time scale which governs the small scales is determined by the smoothed velocity field alone ( even though there were two other candidate power laws derived in @xcite ) .    we dedicate this work to our friend and colleague darryl d. holm on the occasion of his 60th birthday in acknowledgement of his continuing support and inspiration in stimulating scientific interactions and discussions over the past years and many to come .",
    "in this section we give a comparison between the two @xmath0-models . for completeness",
    "we briefly present the analytical arguments for the different power laws of the energy spectra which arise in the 2d leray-@xmath0 equations . for complete details",
    "we direct the reader to look at the derivation of power laws of the 2d ns-@xmath0 in @xcite ( see also @xcite for the analytical calculation of the power laws of energy spectra for the other @xmath0-models ) . to compute the scaling of the smoothed energy spectrum @xmath55 of the 2d leray-@xmath0 in the wavenumber regime @xmath2 in the forward enstrophy inertial subrange , we start by splitting the flow into the three wavenumber ranges @xmath56 . for a wavenumber @xmath57 , we define the component @xmath58 of a velocity field @xmath10 by @xmath59 and the component @xmath60 with a range of wavenumbers @xmath61 by @xmath62 @xmath55 is then the energy spectrum associated to @xmath63 which is the average ( with respect to an infinite time average measure @xcite ) smoothed energy per unit mass of eddies of linear size @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "we assume @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the forcing wavenumber , since we are interested on the effects of the leray-@xmath0 model in the enstrophy cascade regime .",
    "we decompose the @xmath10 , @xmath9 and the @xmath67 and @xmath68 corresponding to the three wavenumber ranges .",
    "we then write the enstrophy balance equation for the leray-@xmath0 model for an eddy of size   @xmath69 . taking an ensemble average ( with respect to infinite time average measure ) of the enstrophy balance equation we get @xmath70 where @xmath71 may be interpreted as the net amount of enstrophy per unit time that is transferred into wavenumbers larger than or equal to @xmath57 .",
    "similarly , @xmath72 represents the net amount of enstrophy per unit time that is transferred into wavenumbers larger than or equal to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , @xmath74 represents the net amount of enstrophy per unit time that is transferred into wavenumbers in the interval @xmath75 .",
    "we then rewrite the averaged enstrophy transfer equation ( [ taet1 ] ) as @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the energy spectrum associated to @xmath78 which is the average energy per unit mass of eddies of linear size @xmath64 $ ] .",
    "thus , as long as @xmath79 ( that is , @xmath80 , there is no leakage of enstrophy due to dissipation ) , the wavenumber @xmath57 belongs to the inertial range . in the forward cascade inertial subrange ,",
    "we follow kraichnan @xcite ( see also @xcite ) and postulates that the eddies of size larger than @xmath34 transfer their energy to eddies of size smaller than @xmath81 in the time @xmath49 it takes to travel their length @xmath82 .",
    "that is , @xmath83 where @xmath84 is the average velocity of eddies of size @xmath85 . since there are two different velocities in the leray-@xmath0 model , there are three physically relevant possibilities for this average velocity , namely @xmath86 these define the aforementioned ` typical ' velocities , in particular @xmath87 and @xmath88 .",
    "corresponding definitions may be made for @xmath36 and @xmath35 using the variables for the ns-@xmath0 model , see @xcite .",
    "thus , @xmath89    we may therefore write the typical time scale of an eddy of size @xmath90 in ( [ tau ] ) as @xmath91 that is , in keeping with the historical approach to the problem @xcite , there are in principal three different time scales and it is left to empirical evidence to infer the correct time scale for a particular @xmath0-model .",
    "the enstrophy dissipation rate @xmath92 which is a constant equal to the flux of enstrophy from wavenumber @xmath57 to @xmath73 is given by @xmath93 and hence @xmath94 thus , the energy spectrum of the smoothed velocity @xmath10 is given by @xmath95 therefore , depending on the average velocity of an eddy of size @xmath90 for the leray-@xmath0 model , we obtain three possible scalings of the energy spectrum , @xmath96 , @xmath97 all of which decay steeper than the kraichnan @xmath98 power law , in the subrange @xmath99 .",
    "_ the goal , which we stress here again , is to infer the correct time scale by measuring the scaling exponent of energy spectra computed from high - resolution numerical simulation data .",
    "_    we summarize some points of comparison between the two models in table [ nsavsla ] . in the absence of viscosity @xmath13 and the forcing @xmath14 , the two conserved quantities , namely the energy and enstrophy , for the two models , in two dimensions , are specified in the first block - row of table [ nsavsla ] .",
    "since the energy in 2d flow goes upscale ( @xcite ) , we are more interested in the enstrophy which has its dominate cascade downscale ( @xcite ) . for the ns-@xmath0 model ,",
    "the enstrophy conserved is @xmath100 , while for the leray-@xmath0 , the conserved enstrophy is given by @xmath101 .",
    "it is for this reason that the characteristic time scale for eddies of size smaller than the length scale @xmath0 , for the two models , differ .",
    "the second block - row gives the three possible characteristic time scales , and the corresponding scaling predictions , three for each of the models .",
    "the notation in table 1 defaults to that for ns-@xmath0 ; replace @xmath102 by @xmath103 , respectively , in the formula for @xmath49 for leray-@xmath0 .",
    "these three possibilities for @xmath49 and the corresponding power laws are given in table  [ nsavsla ] .",
    "in @xcite , it was shown that the energy spectrum of the 2d ns-@xmath27 equations attains a power law of @xmath3 as the resolution is increased .",
    "the convergence of the spectral scaling is presented in the third block - row in table [ nsavsla ] .",
    "a similar study for the 2d leray-@xmath27 shows a convergence to a power law of @xmath4 as we shall show in the next section .",

    "in figures  [ fig : pn ] and [ fig : pl ] we use the notation @xmath122 for @xmath55 . in figure [ fig : pn ] we present the main numerical results from @xcite for the 2d ns-@xmath27 equations , showing the @xmath3 scaling of the energy spectrum . in figure",

    "this conclusion is consistent with our original prediction in @xcite that , in general , the dominant cascading conserved quantity in the @xmath0-model dictates the time scale associated with eddy of size @xmath34 and hence the power law of the energy spectrum @xmath55 in the subrange @xmath2 .",
    "the main goal of this study is to verify our claim in @xcite about the choice of particular characteristic time scales of eddy of size @xmath34 , for @xmath2 , for particular @xmath0-model equations .",

    "we summarize the three steps to this study which verifies these claims :    1 .",
    "identify the conserved quantities ( in the absence of viscosity and forcing ) for 2d leray-@xmath0 , and the dominant one in the forward cascade regime .",
    "2 .   calculate the power laws using semi - rigorous arguments as in @xcite .",
    "this will give us the three possible power laws of the energy spectrum in the wavenumber regime @xmath2 .",
    "3 .   perform a high - resolution simulation to identify which one of the power laws of the energy spectrum calculated in step ( ii ) actually arise for the 2d leray-@xmath0 model .",
    "+ as we have speculated in @xcite , the scaling exponent in the wavenumber regime @xmath2 will be governed by the time scale of the dominant cascading conserved quantity in that regime .",
    "if we extend the same argument to predict the scaling for the 3d ns-@xmath0 and the 3d leray-@xmath0 model equations then we obtain the following predictions .",
