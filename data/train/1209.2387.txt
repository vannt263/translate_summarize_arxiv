    "the investigation of quantum lattice models is one of the central themes in modern condensed matter physics .",
    "a crucial step is to develop novel numerical methods to efficiently simulate the interesting and complex phenomena of quantum many - body systems . in particular , the tensor network states and the related renormalization group methods , including the tree tensor network state ( ttn),@xcite the multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz,@xcite the projected entangled pair state,@xcite the tensor renormalization group ( trg),@xcite and the second renormalization group ( srg),@xcite are now under rapid development .",
    "these methods provide promising numerical tools for studying strongly correlated systems , especially for the frustrated magnetic systems and fermion models , and can be regarded as an extension of the fruitful density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg)@xcite in two or higher dimensions .    in the study of the tensor network methods",
    ", one needs to first determine the tensor network wavefunction for the ground state . in refs .",
    "[ ] , a simple update scheme is proposed to determine the ground state tensor network wavefunction in two dimensions .",
    "this scheme is efficient and robust .",
    "it proceeds in three steps : ( 1 ) apply the imaginary time projection operators simultaneously on bonds of the same type , for example the @xmath2 directional bonds in fig .",
    "[ fig - bethe - latt]a , and enlarge the bond dimension ; ( 2 ) construct a local evolving block matrix and simulate the environment contribution by the diagonal matrices on the external bonds [ @xmath3 and @xmath4 in fig .",
    "[ fig - bethe - latt]b ] ; ( 3 ) decompose the evolving block matrix by singular value decomposition ( svd ) and decimate the vector space of the enlarged geometric bond according to the singular values in the updated diagonal matrix @xmath5 . this technique has been combined with the trg / srg to evaluate the ground state properties of two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg models.@xcite it is an accurate numerical method for evaluating local physical quantities , but it is less accurate in evaluating the long - range correlation functions.@xcite this is the major drawback of this simple update scheme .",
    "it results from a mean - field approximation for the environment tensor .",
    "a way to go beyond this approximation is to enlarge the size of the cluster that is used for evaluating the environment tensor .",
    "this , as shown by wang and verstraete@xcite , can indeed improve the accuracy for the long range correlation function .    in this work",
    ", we apply the simple update scheme to infinite ttn ( ittn ) states on the bethe lattice .",
    "we will show that this is a quasi - canonical approach for treating an ittn . here by the word `` quasi - canonical '' we mean that with increasing the number of iteration steps and decreasing the trotter error , the tree tensor network state obtained by the simple update scheme would become asymptotically canonical [ i.e.  the tensors satisfy certain canonical orthonormality conditions , see eqs .",
    "( [ eq - can3 ] ) below ] .",
    "thus the simple update scheme provides an accurate and efficient approach for evaluating the ground state wavefunction on the bethe lattice .    the bethe lattice , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - bethe - latt]a , has a self - similar structure with an infinite hausdorff dimension .",
    "the size of the lattice is infinite , hence the boundary effects do not need to be explicitly considered .",
    "the bethe lattice was first used in the study of classical statistical mechanics.@xcite it has attracted broader interest since a number of chemical compounds with the bethe lattice structures , such as the dendrimers,@xcite have been synthesized in the laboratory.@xcite    a finite bethe lattice is called a cayley tree . soon after white s invention of dmrg,@xcite the dmrg algorithm for the quantum lattice models defined on the cayley tree was proposed .",
    "@xcite based on the dmrg calculation of local physical quantities in the central part of the cayley tree , otsuka@xcite claimed that the anisotropic s=1/2 heisenberg model ( i.e. the xxz model ) on the bethe lattice should exhibit a first - order phase transition at the isotropic point .",
    "later friedman@xcite proposed an improved dmrg scheme and evaluated the spin - spin correlations in the ground state .",
    "based on the dmrg result , he suggested that long - range magnetic order might exist at the isotropic heisenberg point .",
    "recently , kumar et al . calculated the magnetization with a further improved dmrg algorithm , @xcite and showed that such long - range magnetic order does exist at that point .",
    "the above dmrg calculations were done on the cayley tree lattice , not on the true infinite bethe lattice .",
    "furthermore , it should be pointed out that the boundary effect is very strong on a finite cayley tree since more than one - half of the total sites reside on the lattice edge .",
    "this may strongly affect the properties of the system . in some cases",
    ", the results obtained on a cayley tree lattice can be completely different from those for the corresponding bethe lattice . for example",
    ", the classical ising model shows a phase transition on the bethe lattice , but not on the cayley tree lattice.@xcite    to unambiguously resolve the above problems , it is necessary to calculate the spin models directly on the bethe lattice .",
    "the recent development of the ttn algorithms @xcite has indeed made this feasible.@xcite in particular , nagaj _",
    "et al _ in ref . extended the infinite time evolving - block decimation@xcite technique to the bethe lattice and determined the ground state wavefunction by imaginary time evolution . for the transverse ising model on the bethe lattice",
    ", it was found that a second - order quantum phase transition exists at a critical transverse field .",
    "an interesting result revealed in this calculation is that even at the second - order critical point , the correlation length remains finite . for the bethe lattice with coordination @xmath6",
    ", the correlation length is shown to be less than @xmath7 . however , in the calculation nagaj _ et al _ used a three - site projection operator to simultaneously evolve the two equivalent incoming legs of the tensors , the computational cost is thus very high .",
    "the computational time scales as o(@xmath8 ) with @xmath9 the tensor dimension , which limits the value of @xmath9 that can be handled to @xmath10 .",
    "recently , nagy@xcite proposed a different algorithm to reduce the computational cost by making use of the @xmath11 rotational symmetry of @xmath6 bethe lattice .",
    "this algorithm reduces the computational cost to o(@xmath12 ) hence greatly improves the efficiency .",
    "it can be used for studying the spin-1/2 quantum lattice models .",
    "however , the application of this method is restricted to the translation invariant spin-1/2 system .     bethe lattice .",
    "every site has 3 nearest neighbors , and the three bonds are labeled according to their directions as @xmath2 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "( b ) the two - site cluster used in the single - bond projection of the simple update scheme .",
    "the diagonal matrices @xmath3 and @xmath4 on the dangling bonds should be included in the projection to mimic the entanglement renormalization of the environment to this two - site system .",
    "( c ) a minimum cluster that is used in the bethe approximation .",
    "it consists of one a tensor and three nearest - neighbor b tensors ( or vice versa ) . ]",
    "as will be shown below , the simple update scheme is very efficient .",
    "its computational costs scale as o(@xmath12 ) , similar as for the algorithm proposed by nagy@xcite .",
    "but it is much more flexible .",
    "it can be applied to treat arbitrary ttn states , with or without translation invariance .",
    "here we studied two spin models defined on the bethe lattice .",
    "one is the transverse ising model and the other is the antiferromagnetic xxz heisenberg model .",
    "the quantum phase transitions and the ground state phase diagrams of these models are studied .",
    "the rest of the paper is arranged as follows .",
    "an introduction to the simple update scheme and its relationship with the bethe approximation is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] .",
    "the study of the quantum phase transitions of transverse ising and xxz heisenberg models are presented in secs .",
    "iii and iv , respectively . in sec .",
    "v , the present scheme is generalized to larger tree tensor clusters , in order to provide more accurate approximations for 2d lattices .",
    "finally , sec vi is devoted to a summary .",
    "the ittn state on the bethe lattice comprises 4-indexed tensors @xmath15 and @xmath16 defined on the vertices , and the diagonal matrices @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 defined on the bonds along the @xmath2 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 directions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - bethe - latt]a , respectively .",
    "the bond indices represent the quantum numbers of the virtual basis states .",
    "the physical index @xmath20 runs over the @xmath21 basis states of the local hilbert space at each lattice site .",
    "the diagonal matrices store the entanglement information , and play an important role in the simple update scheme .    in order to determine the ground state wavefunction , the imaginary time evolving operators @xmath22 are applied to the ittn iteratively . at each step , the dimension of the evolved bond is increased by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "thus the tensor dimensions will proliferate exponentially with the increasing number of projection steps . in order to sustain the projections until the ittn converges to the true ground state wavefunction , one needs to truncate the bond dimension after each projection step .",
    "this needs a proper consideration of the renormalization effect of the environment tensor .",
    "an accurate and full determination of the environment tensor is computationally costly .",
    "this limits generally the tensor dimension @xmath9 that can be handled to a rather small value , say @xmath24 .",
    "the simple update scheme@xcite , on the other hand , takes the product of the dangling bond matrices as a mean field approximation to the environment tensor .",
    "it converts the complicated global optimization problem into a local one , and hence greatly simplifies the calculation . on the regular 2d lattice",
    ", the bond matrix is an approximate measure of the entanglement between the system and environment tensors .",
    "however , as will be shown later , the square of the diagonal bond matrix on the bethe lattice is the eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix if the ittn is canonicalized , i.e. , if the tensors in the network are always kept in canonical form by some transformations .",
    "thus the simple update scheme is an accurate treatment for the renormalization of the ittn on the bethe lattice .",
    "the simple update scheme is also closely related to the famous bethe approximation.@xcite to understand this , we show in fig . [ fig - bethe - latt]c a 4-site cluster , which contains one a tensor and three b tensors . in the simple update calculation , the two local tensors , a and b , and the three inner bond matrices ( @xmath25 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) should be evaluated and updated iteratively . after each single projection step on the inner bonds , to keep the scheme self - consistent , one should also update all the dangling bonds of the cluster , by replacing the bond matrices with the corresponding ones on the inner bonds .",
    "this cluster structure and the self - consistent scheme is in fact the bethe approximation that was first proposed by bethe in 1930 s , in the context of statistical mechanics.@xcite the key idea is to treat the correlations between the central spin and its nearest neighbors in the cluster exactly , and to use an effective mean field to approximate the interactions between the cluster and the rest lattice spins . by solving this simple cluster problem , and assuming that all the spins in the cluster have exactly the same local magnetization",
    ", one can determine the spontaneous magnetization self - consistently .",
    "for the quantum cases , the six diagonal matrices on the dangling bonds of the cluster are taken as the mean fields acting on the inner block .",
    "the self - consistent condition requires that the matrices @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 on dangling bonds are equal to the corresponding matrices on the inner bonds between a and b tensors ( see fig . [",
    "fig - bethe - latt]c ) .    , which will be involved in the following projection steps .",
    "there are diagonal matrices on the dangling bonds ( @xmath13 and @xmath14 bonds ) of a and b tensors .",
    "( b ) absorb the four dangling matrices into a and b , and define the block matrix @xmath26 .",
    "then take the qr decomposition for @xmath26 , obtaining @xmath27 and @xmath28 matrices .",
    "( c ) project @xmath29 onto the bond by contractions , and obtain the block matrix @xmath30 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq - g ] ) ] .",
    "( d ) take singular value decomposition of @xmath30 to find the unitary matrices @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the new diagonal matrix @xmath33 .",
    "( e ) truncate the @xmath2-bond dimension to @xmath9 according to the diagonal values of @xmath33 .",
    "merge @xmath31 ( @xmath34 ) , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 together into @xmath27 , finally we arrive at the updated @xmath37 tensors . ]",
    "a tensor network state contains redundant gauge degrees of freedom on each bond .",
    "it is invariant if one inserts a product of two reciprocal matrices on a bond and absorbs separately each of them to a local tensor at the two ends of the bond .",
    "this gauge invariance of a tensor network state can be used to simplify the calculation of local tensors , especially for the ittn states on the bethe lattice , where a special gauge , called canonical form , can be introduced .    to be specific ,",
    "the local tensors of canonical ittn states satisfy the following orthonormality conditions @xmath38 where t represents the a or b tensor .",
    "if we cut an arbitrary bond to divide the bethe lattice into two parts , denoted as a system and an environment subblock , one can then define the reduced density matrix of the system block by integrating out all the degrees of freedom of the environment block .",
    "for the tensors that satisfy eqs .",
    "( [ eq - can1]-[eq - can3 ] ) , the square of the diagonal bond matrices are the eigenvalues , and the renormalized bond bases are the eigenvectors of the corresponding reduced density matrix , which are orthonormal to each other .",
    "thus , in terms of the schmidt decomposition , the square of the diagonal matrix elements represent the probability amplitudes of the corresponding eigenvectors appearing in the wavefunction .    the existence of this simple canonical form of the ittn , i.e. eqs .",
    "( [ eq - can1]-[eq - can3 ] ) , is very useful in the calculations .",
    "first , the diagonal bond matrix describes the entanglement spectrum between the system and environment subblocks .",
    "thus to select the virtual bond basis states according to the values of these diagonal matrix elements provides an optimal scheme to truncate the bond dimension .",
    "second , the contribution of the environment tensors can be faithfully represented by the 4 diagonal matrices on the dangling bonds surrounding the central bond under projection ( see fig . [",
    "fig - ctn]a ) .",
    "it means that the imaginary time evolution on each bond can be done rigorously and locally .",
    "furthermore , we can also evaluate the expectation value of a local operator simply by contracting a small cluster comprising those tensors and bond matrices on which the operator acts .",
    "this significantly reduces the computational cost .    bearing in mind the benefits of the canonical ittn states",
    ", one can perform explicitly the canonical transformations during the projection processes .",
    "however , to further save computational costs , in practical calculations we choose to carry out the imaginary time evolution just using the simple update scheme , and gradually reduce the trotter step @xmath39 , which would bring the ittn states into its canonical form step by step .",
    "this scheme works because the diagonal bond matrix provides an approximate measure for the entanglement between the two sides of the bond and can be used to substitute approximately the environment tensor .",
    "therefore , it can stabilize the algorithm of the imaginary time evolution , provided that the trotter step @xmath39 is small enough so that the bond projection operator @xmath40 is nearly unitary.@xcite this near unitary evolution can modify the wavefunction and reshape it in order to satisfy the canonical conditions .",
    "the simple update scheme hence provides a quasi - canonical evolution of the ittn state , which will finally converge to the ground state and become canonical in the limit @xmath41 . in practical calculations , the trotter step @xmath39 is gradually decreased from @xmath42 to @xmath43 , and the total number of projections steps varies from 20000 to 200000 .",
    "now let us consider how to implement the simple update scheme efficiently .",
    "a simple approach is to do directly the singular value decomposition the evolving block tensor , which is a matrix of @xmath44 .",
    "the computational cost for doing this singular value decomposition is high , since it scales as @xmath45 .",
    "this cost can in fact be reduced to @xmath46 if we carry out this singular value decomposition in the following steps ( again , projection on @xmath2 bond is taken as an example ) :    \\(1 ) define the following two @xmath47 block matrices ( fig .",

    "however , the spontaneous magnetization for the ground state of the heisenberg model on the bethe lattice , namely @xmath135 , is much larger than the corresponding value on the honeycomb lattice , which is about 0.27 as obtained by the quantum monte carlo.@xcite notice , some other results for the magnetization on the honeycomb or square lattice obtained with the tensor network algorithms are also found to be higher than the monte carlo ones.@xcite    as a next step , our approximate treatment of the 2d honeycomb lattice can be improved by using tensor networks that include rings . in fig .",
    "[ fig - one - ring ] , the cluster with one hexagonal ring is shown , some geometric bonds are removed ( dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig - one - ring ] ) to form a tree tensor cluster .",
    "note although the tensor network does not have geometric bonds on the dashed lines , in the hamiltonian the couplings along these bonds nevertheless exist .",
    "therefore , the projections by imaginary time evolution should be executed also on the dashed lines .",
    "this can not be done directly as on usual bonds , but can be accomplished as follows with the help of the swap gates .",
    "the swap gates are used to exchange the physical indices of two tensors , which proceeds similarly as the projection scheme illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - ctn ] , with the minor revision that the imaginary tim evolving operator @xmath29 is now replaced with a swap operator @xmath142 , that conducts @xmath143 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig - one - ring ] , take the dashed bond between site a and f as an example , swap gates moves the physical index on site a in the order a @xmath144 b @xmath144 c , and the physical index on site f as f @xmath144 e @xmath144 d. after that , the two spins are linked by the solid bond between c and d , then we can take the projection and update processes as on an usual bond .",
    "after that , we have to move the two spin indices back to their original positions by reversed swap operations , which accomplishes the special projection step on a dashed bond . through iterative and self - consistent projection processes on the solid and the dashed bonds of the tree cluster ,",
    "an approximation for 2d lattices can be obtained .",
    "compared with the simple bethe lattice , this tree tensor cluster approach can provide better approximation for 2d .",
    "on the other hand , it can also be regarded as an ideal method for evaluating the `` super bethe lattice '' , of which each `` single site '' is now placed with a hexagonal ring , instead of a single site , and the coordinate number @xmath145 .    beyond the one - ring cluster ,",
    "more rings can be included to further enlarge the cluster . as an example ,",
    "[ fig - four - ring ] shows a cluster with 4 hexagonal rings .",
    "the accuracy of energy versus different cluster size ( labelled by the number of rings included ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - eng - clust ] , which verifies that the accuracy could be improved consistently with enhancing the cluster size . to obtain better approximation for true 2d lattices ,",
    "the local observables are detected in the center area of the cluster . in practice , for the 4-ring tree tensor cluster in fig .",
    "[ fig - four - ring ] , the results are obtained by averaging over sites 3 and 4 .",
    "we find an energy per site of @xmath146 ( bond energy @xmath147 ) and a local magnetization of @xmath148/h_s \\simeq 0.3147 $ ] ( with a staggered magnetic field @xmath149 ) .",
    "hence , the inclusion of rings clearly improves the agreement with qmc data . for the transverse ising model , through the 4-ring cluster calculations , the phase transition point is estimated as @xmath150 , which is also more accurate than the simple bethe approximation .",
    "more numerical results with larger clusters and further details of this cluster bethe approximation will be published separately .",
    "in summary , the simple update scheme is employed to study two spin models on the bethe lattice , i.e. , the transverse ising and the heisenberg xxz model . for the ising model",
    ", it is found that the correlation length , as well as the entanglement entropy , does not diverge at the second - order transition point . through a scale transformation ,",
    "we have given an intuitive explanation of this peculiar `` critical '' phenomenon .",
    "moreover , by studying the magnetic susceptibility , we show that the correlation length is upper bounded . for the heisenberg xxz model , the existence of a first - order phase transition at the isotropic point",
    "is clearly verified , and the two different magnetic ordered phases are identified as the easy - plain and easy - axis phases , respectively .",
    "furthermore , in terms of the bethe approximation , we obtain accurate and scalable approximations for the 2d lattice models by applying the simple update to tree tensor clusters .",
