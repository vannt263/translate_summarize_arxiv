    "the diffraction radiation ( dr ) is stipulated by means of dynamic perturbation of electronic shells of atoms and free electrons by an electromagnetic field of a charged particle moving near a conductive target . an effective transversal size of a relativistic electron field for its component with wavelength @xmath0 is about @xmath1 where @xmath2 - is the lorentz factor of an electron .",
    "this value can reach macroscopic sizes in ultrarelativistic case , allowing the distance between an electron beam and the target to be increased . a transition radiation , in contrast ,",
    "is generated during passing of an initial particle through material of a target . in case of the periodic target to be used , there maybe a constructive interference of radiation from different elements of a target and",
    "the radiation becomes resonant in this case .",
    "the special case of resonant diffraction radiation , when the electron moves in parallel to a periodic target plane is referred as smith - purcell radiation ( spr ) @xcite .",
    "there are two types of targets for this geometry of experiment : a volume grating obtained by a periodic deformation of a continuous surface , and a flat periodic target obtained by alternation of metal strips and vacuum ( dielectric ) gaps .",
    "authors of the work @xcite suggested to use cspr for bunch length measurements .",
    "changing the observation angle ( in other words , the cspr wavelength ) one may detect a sharp increase in cspr intensity when the wavelength becomes more than a bunch length .",
    "but the usage of a traditional lamellar grating for this aim has some disadvantages : for a set of observation angles there may exist deep minima in the cspr angular distribution @xcite .",
    "it leads to significant troubles in interpretation of experimental data .",
    "another method of the beam diagnostics suggested in @xcite is based on the rotation of the grating in the grating plane to change an effective grating period and needs the developed theory of spr effect for a rotated grating that is absent now . as with of grating rotation",
    "the spectra of cspr became wider and this technique should be investigated both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "the use of a flat grating for the beam diagnostic technique allows one to avoid the angular distribution unevens and to increase the radiation yield @xcite .",
    "the basis of theoretical model for calculation of radiation characteristics from a flat target is the exact solution of maxwell equations for diffraction radiation caused by relativistic electron moving close to a thicknessless ideal conductive half - plane @xcite .    as shown in @xcite the spectral - angular distribution of spr from a flat grating consisting of _ n _ strips with width _ a _ and period _ d _ , separated by vacuum gaps with width _",
    "( d - a ) _ can be written as :    @xmath3}}{{1/\\beta - cos { \\theta } } } sin\\left [ { \\frac{{\\pi a}}{{\\lambda } } \\left ( { cos\\theta - \\frac{{1}}{{\\beta } } } \\right ) } \\right ] \\cdot f_{n}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here @xmath4 -is a fine structure constant , @xmath5- conversion constant , @xmath6- distance between the particle trajectory and the target surface , @xmath7 - outgoing photon angle , @xmath8- velocity of particle in units of light speed,@xmath2 is lorentz - factor , @xmath0 - is spr wavelength , @xmath9 - coefficient , taking into account the interference of radiation from @xmath10 periodically spaced strips ,    @xmath11    fig .",
    "1 shows the calculated dependence of radiation wavelength on the observation angle which follows from the equation for @xmath12 ( smith - purcell dispersion law ) .",
    "it is evidently that , with increasing the observation angle the spectral lines are shifted to large wavelength region .    with the radiation wavelength exceeding the longitudinal size of an electron bunch , all the electrons from a bunch emit coherently . in this case radiation yield ,",
    "normalized to one electron , increases proportionally to the number of electrons in the bunch .",
    "the yield of coherent radiation for a bunch with number of electrons @xmath13 in the aperture of the detector @xmath14 registered by the detector with bandwidth @xmath15 can be expressed as follows :    @xmath16    here @xmath17- is the longitudinal form - factor of a bunch , @xmath18 - spectral efficiency of the detector , @xmath19 - length of the bunch . in fig .  2",
    "is given the relation between the squared form - factor modulus and radiation wavelengths for gauss longitudinal distribution of electrons in a bunch .",
    "in figure we consider a bunchlength @xmath19 equal to @xmath20 in longitudinal distribution of electrons .",
    "it is clear from the figure that , for example , for @xmath21 level of a maximum intensity corresponds wavelength @xmath22 .",
    "that is , the measurement of angular distribution of cspr ( in other words , measurement of spectral dependence of a cspr yield ) allows a length of an electron bunch to be determined .",
    "the experiment was carried out in npi msu on a linac with the following parameters of electron beam ( see table  1 ) .",
    "the experimental setup is shown in fig .",
    "the beam with energy 5mev is extracted through a 20 micrometer titanium foil and moves at a distance @xmath23  mm from a periodic target .",
    "table1    [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the target , size @xmath24 mm consisting of 8 copper strips with 3 mm width and @xmath25 micrometer thickness , located 3 mm apart on an insulating substrate , was placed in parallel to beam in the goniometer , by which it was possible to tune the parallelism between the beam trajectory and the target and change the impact parameter @xmath6 .",
    "the detector may be rotated on the table with radius @xmath26 m that allows one to change angle of photon detection .",
    "the center of rotation coincides with a target center . in the experiment we registered cspr together with transition radiation ( tr ) background from the exit window foil .",
    "the detector was made on the basis of a room - temperature resonance funnel - shaped antenna with the following characteristics : resonant wavelength @xmath27  mm , a band width @xmath28 mm , sensitivity : @xmath29 v / w , response time @xmath30 ns . the polar angle acceptance @xmath31 .",
    "assuming that the dielectric constant of the target insulator substrate is the same as for vacuum , we have calculated the radiation power registered by the detector for our condition and @xmath32 mm ( see formula(2 ) ) and obtained value @xmath33 .",
    "figure 4 presents the calculated dependence of cspr intensity on the angle of detection in the real aperture of the detector with regard to the spectral efficiency .",
    "the experimental relations between cspr intensity and angle of observation , the impact parameter and a current of an electron beam are shown in figures 5,6,7 .",
    "comparing figures 4 and 5 it is possible to notice the reasonable agreement between the theoretical model and experiment .",
    "the monochromaticity of the main maximum is defined by the number of the lattice periods and band pass of the detector @xmath34 .    the narrow peaks in fig .",
    "5 for angles @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be explained by resonances of a narrow - band detector .",
    "to get dependence of cspr intensity on the impact parameter , the detector was installed at angle @xmath37 that corresponded to the maximal value of cspr .    in fig .",
    "6 the value @xmath38 corresponds to a beam passing exactly through a target and the dip at this value @xmath6 is explained by scattering the electrons on target material .",
    "the approximation of dependence of cspr intensity on the impact parameter by exponential function @xmath39 $ ] , where @xmath40 , gives the value of mean detected wavelength of cspr @xmath41 , that agrees well with resonant wavelength of the detector .    for confirming a coherent character of radiation we measured a dependence of its intensity on pulse current of a macrobunch , @xmath42 , proportional to the number of particles in the bunch .",
    "it canbe seen from fig .",
    "7 that for @xmath43  ma the dependence of cspr yield is @xmath44 , where @xmath45 . with experimental error accuracy ,",
    "the dependence of cspr intensity on the current of electron beam is square - law , that confirms the coherent character of radiation . for values @xmath42 , exceeding",
    "@xmath46ma detector starts to work in a nonlinear regime .",
    "it is necessary to notice that the experiment was performed for @xmath47 condition .",
    "in conclusion we may note that using @xmath48 mev beam of a linac npi msu we investigated characteristics of cspr and showed , that the cspr mechanism provided the high monochromaticity of radiation even for a target with @xmath49 periods only and the aperture of the detector @xmath50 , whereas the continuous component in a spectrum connected with background processes ( tr from exit window , for instance ) is small enough . also it is necessary to pay attention to the fact , that for @xmath51 the cspr yield practically does not depend on @xmath52 ( for @xmath53 and for @xmath54 difference is a few percent ) .",
    "the macropulse power of cspr is proportional to @xmath55 , where @xmath56 - the number of bunches in macropulse , ( for a linac npi msu estimation from ( 2 ) gives @xmath57 ) .",
    "for such accelerators as kek - atf and slac fftb with number of electrons in a bunch @xmath58 , this power level is reached for a single bunch .",
    "thus , the received power level demonstrates a possibility of measurement of a single bunch length using a flat grating and a set of detectors with responsivity : @xmath59 , operating at room temperature and with different resonance wavelengths located at different angles @xmath7 . a resonance condition and requirement of coherency of a bunch radiation",
    "define the wavelength range accessible to the bunch length measurement by this method : @xmath60 . for example , for @xmath61 mm,@xmath62 mm,@xmath63 mm one can use the detector for a far infrared range",
