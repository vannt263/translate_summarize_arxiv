    "the experimental progam in gravitational wave detection that is currently under way  @xcite has brought renewed attention to the problem of obtaining high accuracy predictions for the evolution and gravitational radiation power spectra of binary star systems with neutron star or black hole constituents . the conventional approach to calculating the initial inspiral of the system as it slowly loses energy to gravitational radiation employs the post - newtonian ( pn ) approximation to general relativity . essentially , this formalism consists of systematically solving the einstein equations with non - relativistic ( nr ) sources as a power series expansion in @xmath6 , where @xmath3 is a typical three - velocity of the system under consideration  @xcite . for binary systems that can be detected by ligo , which have binary constituents with masses in the range @xmath7 ,",
    "the inspiral phase spans roughly @xmath8 , corresponding to orbital separations from about @xmath9 to a few times @xmath10 .",
    "a detector such as ligo is particularly sensitive to the time varying phase @xmath11 of the gravitational waves emitted during the evolution of the binary system  @xcite . in the pn formalism , this observable can be obtained by calculating the mechanical energy @xmath12 as well as the total power @xmath13 emitted in gravitational radiation as functions of the orbital parameters of the binary system . taking for illustration the extreme mass ratio limit and using conservation of energy , @xmath14 , for circular orbits the gravitational wave phase seen by the detector",
    "is then given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the wave s frequency and @xmath17 the mass of the heavy component star . because a typical inspiral event will sweep a large number of radians of phase as it scans the detector frequency band ( e.g , for ligo , with a frequency range @xmath18  hz",
    ", the number of cycles for a neutron star / neutron star binary is of order @xmath19 ) , to compare the predictions of gr with the experimental data requires computing the observable @xmath11 to extremely high order in the velocity expansion .",
    "for instance , for binary neutron star inspirals in the ligo band , one must know @xmath11 to @xmath20 ( or  3pn \" ) beyond the leading order quadrupole radiation results , and higher order terms in @xmath3 may be necessary for tracking the phase variation of the gravitational waves emitted by more massive objects  @xcite .",
    "several independent research groups have applied variants of the pn formalism to the computation of high order corrections to the gravitational wave observables during the binary inspiral phase  @xcite .",
    "heroic calculational efforts have yielded in the last few years the @xmath4 analytic results necessary to fully interpret the ligo data  @xcite .",
    "while the independent calculations are in agreement including terms up to @xmath21 ( or  @xmath22pn \" ) beyond the predictions of newtonian gravity , the @xmath4 corrections do not give well defined results . at this order",
    ", there seems to be an ambiguity in the pn expansions for the binary system , stemming from scheme dependence in the regularization of singular integrals that arise in the perturbative series .",
    "recently , refs .",
    "@xcite have proposed a resolution of this ambiguity purely within the framework of the pn expansion .",
    "the singular integrals that cause trouble at high orders in @xmath3 can be seen to arise from treating the binary star constituents as point particle sources coupled to general relativity .",
    "it is then clear that these singularities are simply the usual ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences that appear in any field theory coupled to point sources .",
    "their presence is merely a sign that the formalism has limited predictive power and needs to be supplemented by a more complete model that accounts for the fact that the sources are not really pointlike . while in principle one could obtain finite , unambiguous results for experimental observables in this more complete theory",
    ", the price would be much greater computational complexity . even then",
    ", it would be difficult to disentangle the effects that depend upon short distance physics from those that are solely a consequence of the gravitational dynamics . since the goal of the gravitational wave experiments is both to probe the internal structure of strongly gravitating astrophysical systems as well as to test the dynamics of general relativity ( or possible deviations from it )",
    ", it is critical to have a computational approach that can cleanly separate these two aspects of the binary problem .    in this paper , we propose a lagrangian framework for systematically calculating to any order in the pn expansion . within our theory the  ambiguities \" that plague the conventional pn techniques at order @xmath4 and beyond have a natural place in the renormalization program .",
    "our formalism is based on effective field theory ( eft ) reasoning , and it is motivated by the eft approach to nr bound state problems in quantum field theories such as qed and qcd  @xcite . rather than trying to resolve the point particle singularities by resorting to a specific model of the short distance physics , in an eft framework  @xcite we systematically parametrize our ignorance of this structure by including in the effective point particle lagrangian the most general set of operators consistent with the symmetries of the well understood , long wavelength physics . in our case , this long wavelength physics is general relativity , and the symmetry that constrains the dynamics is just general coordinate invariance .",
    "the operators in the point particle action have coefficients which encapsulate the properties of the structure of the extended sources .",
    "uv divergences encountered in calculations in the eft can then be dealt with using any convenient regulator , and renormalized by adjusting the operator coefficients scheme ) .",
    "this has the advantage of not introducing spurious length scales that could spoil dimensional analysis arguments within the eft .",
    "see  @xcite for a discussion of dimensional regularization in the context of conventional pn formalisms ] . given a model of stellar structure , the precise value of these coefficients can be obtained by a uv matching calculation that we describe below in sec .",
    "[ sec : matching ] .",
    "note that because these operators are intrinsic to the structure of the sources , the matching procedure can be carried out for a single source in isolation , independently of the complicated binary star dynamics . in this way the eft manages to disentangle the model dependent aspects of the gravitational wave signals from the features that arise as unambiguous predictions of general relativity .",
    "an eft also has the advantage of having manifest power counting in the expansion parameter of the theory , in our case the velocity @xmath3 .",
    "this means that in the eft it is possible to calculate , using simple scaling arguments , the order in @xmath3 which a given term in the perturbative series ( i.e , a typical feynman diagram obtained from the vertices of the effective lagrangian or an operator in the effective theory ) first contributes to a given physical observable .",
    "in particular , one can determine ahead of any calculation the number of terms in the point particle lagrangian that will appear at any order in @xmath3 .    as an example , using our formalism we will see that for binaries with non - spinning black hole or neutron star constituents , the proper time term is sufficient to describe the physics up to @xmath21 .",
    "the apearance of logarithmic divergences in the pn expansion that first appear at order @xmath4 indicates that two new non - minimal terms whose form is dictated by general covariance must be included at this order to consistently renormalize the point particle theory .",
    "however , the coefficients of these operators can be shifted arbitrarily by making field redefinitions of the metric , which indicates that the @xmath4 operators can not contribute to observables .",
    "this gives a clean argument for the absence of @xmath4 finite size effects in the predictions for gravitational wave templates .",
    "ignoring the effects of absorption  @xcite .",
    "we will show how absorptive effects are incorporated into the eft in a future paper .",
    "] , we also find that the next set of point particle operators , including for instance operators quadratic in the riemann curvature , do not contribute until order @xmath5 .",
    "these operators , which can not be removed by field redefinitions , are associated with the leading effects of tidal forces exerted on an isolated neutron star or black hole by an external gravitational field .",
    "the fact that such tidal operators do not arise until @xmath5 is consistent with purely newtonian estimates which also conclude that tidal forces are @xmath5 effects .    finally , an eft has the advantage that it is possible to use renormalization group ( rg ) methods to understand in a simple way logarithms of scale ratios that may arise in the perturbative series for a given observable .",
    "for example , in the nr expansion of the binary star gravitational wave observables , one encounters logarithmic terms of the form @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the ratio of a distance scale @xmath0 that characterizes the size of the binary constituents and @xmath1 is a distance of order the orbital radius ( note that for black hole binaries , the virial theorem relates @xmath25 ) .",
    "we will show that in our eft , the coefficients of operators in the effective point particle action undergo non - trivial rg flows , so that the logarithms of @xmath26 ( tidal logarithms ) can be obtained by rg running from a renormalization scale @xmath27 where the point particle theory is initially defined down to a scale @xmath28 where the binary dynamics takes place .",
    "moreover , the complete structure of the rg flows is encoded in the black hole metric .    as an explicit example of the rg method",
    ", we will give a simplified derivation of the terms at @xmath20 in the two - body interaction lagrangian ( or equivalently the binary gravitational binding energy ) that are enhanced by @xmath29 .",
    "we then show explicitly that the effect of these logarithms do not contribute to physical observables .",
    "this result must follow since , as we already mentioned above , the @xmath4 worldline operators can be removed by redefining the metric . however , this calculation is still useful as a template for determining the logarithmically enhanced terms at higher orders in @xmath3 that stem from true finite size effects .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in the next section",
    "we formulate our eft .",
    "the starting point is a theory of relativistic point particles coupled to gravity .",
    "this theory is appropriate for discussing the dynamics of extended sources at inverse momentum transfers larger than their size @xmath0 .",
    "we then describe the general procedure for matching this theory at the mass scale . ]",
    "@xmath28 , where the binary orbital dynamics takes place , onto an eft that is optimized for the nr limit ( nrgr ) .",
    "the resulting eft has manifest power counting in the typical velocity @xmath3 of the sources , and governs the dynamics of the long wavelength",
    " radiation \" gravitons that propagate out towards the gravitational wave detector . to illustrate our formalism , in this section we also give two classic examples of how the matching procedure and the eft velocity power counting rules are applied to reproduce the leading non - trivial consequences of general relativity in the context of the nr two - body problem : the lagrangian that describes the gravitational interactions of two nr objects at @xmath30 beyond newtonian gravity  @xcite , and the interactions of gravitational radiation with the binary star at leading order in the velocity .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rg ] we return to the relativistic point particle effective lagrangian , and show how all point particle divergences can be absorbed into worldline operators . in sec .",
    "[ sec : matching ] , we discuss how , given a more complete stellar model one can determine the coefficients of operators in the point particle eft at the scale @xmath27 . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : v6log ] we show how the rg running of the eft coefficients at order @xmath4 can be exploited to yield a simplified calculation of the terms in the nr expansion of the two - body gravitational lagrangian that scale as @xmath31 .",
    "this calculation serves as a prototype for the rg running of worldline operators .",
    "we have also included an appendix which illustrates how the feynman rules of the eft are derived and used .",
    "to construct an eft that has manifest velocity power counting , we must first carefully analyze the kinematic configurations that arise in the binary problem . consider a binary system composed of slowly moving neutron stars or black holes .",
    "let @xmath32 characterize the typical mass of the constituents ( taking them , in this discussion , to be roughly the same size ) , @xmath1 the typical separation between them and @xmath3 their relative three - velocity . in a system",
    "whose evolution is determined to leading order by a @xmath33 newtonian interaction , these parameters are not independent , since the virial theorem relates @xmath34 the eft for the binary system will contain degrees of freedom representing the point particle binary constituents coupled to gravitons . while the typical particle momenta are of order @xmath35 , the gravitons appearing in a generic feynman diagram have momenta that can be divided into two classes . gravitons with momentum scaling",
    "as @xmath36 mediate the forces responsible for binding the 2-body system .",
    "these potential gravitons can never go on shell and thus will not appear as propagating degrees of freedom . on the other hand , radiation gravitons with momentum @xmath37 can appear on shell and must be kept in the eft to reproduce the correct long distance physics .",
    "note that the interaction of an nr particle with a single potential or radiation graviton causes the particle to recoil by a fractional amount @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the typical orbital angular momentum of the system .",
    "thus as far as the graviton dynamics is concerned , the nr particles can be treated as background non - dynamical sources .",
    "consequently , in this regard the eft that describes the binary configuration has more in common with heavy particle effective field theories ( eg . , hqet  @xcite ) , in which light modes interact with a static , non - propagating source than a theory such as nrqcd  @xcite , where the quark and gluon degrees of freedom have momentum components which differ only by powers of the velocity .",
    "however , unlike hqet our eft is not an expansion in inverse powers of the mass .",
    "as we will see , treating the stellar objects as non - propagating sources of gravitons also resolves a long standing formal problem in the treatment of general relativity as an eft  @xcite . for astrophysical systems with masses @xmath40",
    ", one would naively conclude from the conventional feynman rules of the eft that the expansion parameter is @xmath41 and therefore the energy expansion implicit in the interpretation of gravity as an eft seems to be spoiled  @xcite .",
    "in fact this obstruction to the eft interpretation of general relativity is only an artifact of treating the point sources as dynamical degrees of freedom , and disappears when the theory is formulated in terms of worldlines interacting with gravitons .",
    "once this is done , the power counting in @xmath3 becomes manifest at the level of the action .",
    "given these remarks , the starting point of our eft formulation consists of a theory of relativistic point particles coupled to gravity @xmath42 where the einstein - hilbert term @xmath43 describes the graviton dynamics and signature @xmath44 .",
    "@xmath45 and @xmath46 determines the motion of the 2-body system ( @xmath47 labels the different particles ) . in this equation , @xmath48 is the proper time along the worldline @xmath49 of the @xmath50 particle",
    ". we will ignore in this paper additional degrees of freedom that describe the spin or any additional multipole moments carried by each particle .",
    "this is justified for an extended object in which the energy cost of exciting internal degrees of freedom is large compared to the typical frequency of the gravitons which it interacts with .",
    "thus strictly speaking the formalism presented here can be used only to describe the dynamics of spinless black holes or spherically symmetric compact objects .",
    "we will save the problem of including multipole moments in the eft for future work .",
    "the first term in @xmath51 generates geodesic motion about the metric @xmath52 . besides this term , we have also explicitly shown the first two of an infinite set of possible non - minimal couplings of the point objects to the spacetime metric . since these non - minimal couplings cause deviations from pure geodesic motion , one would expect them to be associated with the effects of finite spatial extent of the sources .",
    "thus by including the most general set of such operators , we systematically take into account all possible corrections due to the finite size @xmath0 of the object . as we discuss later , the operators linear in the curvature appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pp ] ) will not contribute to any physical observable .",
    "this should be contrasted with higher dimension operators in the point particle action involving higher powers of the curvature tensor , which encode tidal deformations of the binary constituents .",
    "we will discuss in a sec .",
    "[ sec : matching ] how one goes about determining the precise relation between the coefficients of these operators and the microscopic physics ( ie , the stellar structure model ) that determines the internal structure .",
    "a discussion of the laws of motion for extended objects in general relativity can be found in  @xcite .    a gravitational wave detector such as ligo measures indirectly the power emitted in gravitational radiation from the binary system ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) ) . given the action eq .",
    "( [ eq : zoso ] ) , it is in principle possible to calculate this quantity by expanding the metric around flat space , @xmath53 , and integrating out the graviton field @xmath54 to obtain an effective action for the particle coordinates alone @xmath55 = \\int{\\cal d}h_{\\mu\\nu } \\exp[i s_{eh } + is_{pp}].\\ ] ] the effective action @xmath56 $ ] has a real part which generates the coupled equations of motion for the 2-body system , and consequently its mechanical binding energy .",

    "we obtain the classical power spectrum @xmath61 , and therefore the gravitational wave phase seen by the detector .    in principle",

    "furthermore suppose one is interested , because of the limited sensitivity of the detector , in computing an observable only to some fixed order in @xmath3",

    "it is not possible to answer this question with the feynman rules generated by eq .",

    "since from the point of view of the point particle theory , eq .  ( [ eq : zoso ] ) ,",
    "the nr dynamics occurs in the far infrared , to formulate an eft that is tailored to the limit @xmath62 , we must integrate out all field degrees of freedom with wavelengths shorter than the orbital distance scale @xmath1 .",

    "<S> using effective field theory ( eft ) methods we present a lagrangian formalism which describes the dynamics of non - relativistic extended objects coupled to gravity . </S>",
    "<S> the formalism is relevant to understanding the gravitational radiation power spectra emitted by binary star systems , an important class of candidate signals for gravitational wave observatories such as ligo or virgo . </S>",
    "<S> the eft allows for a clean separation of the three relevant scales : @xmath0 , the size of the compact objects , @xmath1 the orbital radius and @xmath2 , the wavelength of the physical radiation ( where the velocity @xmath3 is the expansion parameter ) . in the eft radiation </S>",
    "<S> is systematically included in the @xmath3 expansion without need to separate integrals into near zones and radiation zones . using the eft </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences which arise at @xmath4 in post - newtonian ( pn ) calculations requires the presence of two non - minimal worldline gravitational couplings linear in the ricci curvature . </S>",
    "<S> however , these operators can be removed by a redefinition of the metric tensor , so that the divergences at arising at @xmath4 have no physically observable effect . </S>",
    "<S> because in the eft finite size features are encoded in the coefficients of non - minimal couplings , this implies a simple proof of the decoupling of internal structure for spinless objects to at least order @xmath4 . neglecting absorptive effects </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the power counting rules of the eft indicate that the next set of short distance operators , which are quadratic in the curvature and are associated with tidal deformations , do not play a role until order @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> these operators , which encapsulate finite size properties of the sources , have coefficients that can be fixed by a matching calculation . by including the most general set of such operators , the eft allows one to work within a point particle theory to arbitrary orders in @xmath3 . </S>"
