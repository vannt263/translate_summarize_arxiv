    "self - avoiding walks ( saws ) on regular lattices provide a successful description of the universal configurational properties of polymer chains in good solvent @xcite .",
    "in particular , the average square end - to - end distance @xmath0 of saws with @xmath1 steps obeys the scaling law @xmath2 where the universal exponent @xmath3 only depends on the space dimension @xmath4 . for regular lattices ,",
    "its value is well established ( @xmath5 for @xmath6 ) .",
    "new challenges have been raised recently in studies of biopolymers in natural cellular environments , which are usually very crowded by many other biochemical species occupying a large fraction of the total volume @xcite . in a minimalistic description ,",
    "we assume here this `` volume exclusion '' to be random and frozen , i.e. , quenched , and model the available space for the saws by site percolation clusters on hypercubic lattices at the percolation threshold @xmath7 in @xmath8 .",
    "note that a percolation cluster itself is a fractal object with fractal dimension @xmath9 dependent on the space dimension @xmath4 .",
    "the scaling law ( [ scaling ] ) still holds , but with an exponent @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "when studying physical processes on complicated fractal objects , one often encounters the situation of coexistence of a family of singularities , each associated with a set of different fractal dimensions @xcite . in these problems , an infinite set of critical exponents",
    "is needed to characterize the different moments of the distribution of observables , which scale independently .",
    "these peculiarities are usually referred to as multifractality @xcite .",
    "multifractal properties arise in many different contexts , for example in studies of turbulence in chaotic dynamical systems and strange attractors @xcite , human heartbeat dynamics @xcite , anderson localization transition @xcite , etc .",
    "although the behavior of saws on percolative lattices served as a subject of numerous numerical and analytical studies since the early 80th , not enough attention has been paid to clarifying the multifractality of the problem .",
    "it was only recently proven in field - theoretical studies @xcite that the exponent @xmath11 alone is not sufficient to completely describe the peculiarities of saws on percolation clusters .",
    "instead , a whole spectrum @xmath12 of multifractal exponents emerges @xcite : @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "note that putting @xmath15 in ( [ spectr ] ) , we restore an estimate for the dimension @xmath16 of the underlying backbone of percolation clusters via @xmath17 , and @xmath18 gives us the exponent @xmath11 , governing the scaling law for the averaged end - to - end distance of saws on the backbone of percolation clusters . in the present paper , we report a careful computer simulation study of saws on percolation clusters .",
    "we consider site percolation on regular lattices of edge lengths up to @xmath19 in dimensions @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "each site of the lattice is occupied randomly with probability @xmath21 and empty otherwise . to extract the backbone of a percolation cluster ,",
    "we apply the algorithm proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we construct a saw on percolation clusters , applying the pruned - enriched chain - growth algorithm @xcite .",
    "we let a trajectory of saw grow step by step , until it reaches some prescribed distance ( say @xmath22 ) from the starting point .",
    "then , the algorithm is stopped , and a new saw grows from the same starting point .",
    "in such a way , we are interested in constructing different possible trajectories with fixed end - to - end distance . for each lattice size @xmath23 ,",
    "we change @xmath22 up to @xmath24 to avoid finite - size effects , since close to lattice borders the structure of the backbone of percolation clusters is distorted and thus can falsify the saw statistics .    let us denote by @xmath25 the total number of constructed saw trajectories between @xmath26 and @xmath22 ( we perform @xmath27 saws for each value of @xmath22 ) .",
    "then , for each site @xmath28 of the backbone we sum up the portion of trajectories , passing through this site . in such a way",
    ", we prescribe a weight @xmath29 to each site @xmath30 of the underlying fractal cluster .",

[ nuq ] .",
    "these values appear to be in perfect correspondence with analytical estimates down to @xmath45 dimensions , derived by applying pad approximation to the @xmath14-expansion ( [ spectr ] ) , presenting the given series as ratio @xmath46/[n]$ ] of two polynomials of degree @xmath47 and @xmath48 in @xmath49 .",
