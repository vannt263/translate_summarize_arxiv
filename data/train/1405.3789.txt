    "in recent years much attention has been devoted to the investigation of dense quark ( or baryonic ) matter .",
    "the interest is motivated by the possible existence of quark matter inside compact stars or its creation in heavy ion collisions . in many cases , as e.g. in the above - mentioned heavy ion collision experiments the quark matter densities are not too high , so the consideration of its properties is not possible in the framework of perturbative weak coupling qcd .",
    "usually , different effective theories such as the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , @xmath9 model etc . are more adequate in order to study the qcd and quark matter phase diagram in this case . a variety of spatially nonuniform ( inhomogeneous ) quark matter phases related to chiral symmetry breaking , color superconductivity , and charged pion condensation phenomenon etc .",
    "( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) was predicted in the framework of njl - like models at rather low values of temperature and baryon density .",
    "( a recent interesting review on current model results for inhomogeneous phases in ( 3 + 1)-dimensional systems is presented in @xcite . )",
    "moreover , the phenomenon of spatially nonuniform quark pairing was also intensively investigated within different ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models which can mimic qualitatively the qcd phase diagram . in this connection",
    ", it is necessary to mention gross - neveu ( gn ) type models with four - fermion interactions , symmetrical with respect to the discrete or continuous chiral transformations ( in the last case we shall use for such models the notation njl@xmath10 ) and extended by baryon and isospin chemical potentials . in the framework of these models both the inhomogeneous chiral @xcite and charged pion condensation phenomena were considered @xcite .",
    "( in order to overcome the prohibition on the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry in ( 1 + 1 ) dimensions , the consideration is usually performed in the limit of large @xmath11 , where @xmath11 is the number of quark multiplets . )",
    "inhomogeneous phases in some one - dimensional organic materials and nonrelativistic fermi gases were recently studied , correspondingly , in @xcite and @xcite in terms of ( 1 + 1)-dimensional theories with four - fermion interaction .    among a variety of gn - type models , there is one which describes competition between quark - antiquark ( or chiral ) and quark - quark ( or superconducting ) pairing at nonzero temperature @xmath0 and quark number chemical potential @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "originally , the model was called for to shed new light on the color superconductivity phenomenon in real dense quark matter . moreover , in @xcite the consideration is performed in the supposition that chiral and superconducting condensates are spatially homogeneous . in this case",
    "it was shown there that if @xmath7 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the coupling constants in the chiral and superconducting channels , correspondingly , then at rather high values of quark number chemical potential @xmath1 the superconducting phase is realized in the system .    since in the true ground state of any system with nonzero density",
    "the condensates could be inhomogeneous , the aim of the present paper is to investigate such a possibility .",
    "namely , we shall study the phase structure of the extended model @xcite ( which is symmetric with respect to continuous @xmath12 chiral group ) , assuming that both quark - antiquark and quark - quark condensates might have a spatial inhomogeneity in the form of the fulde - ferrel single plane wave ansatz @xcite , for simplicity .",
    "moreover , in addition to the particle ( or quark ) number chemical potential @xmath1 , we also introduce into consideration the chiral charge chemical potential @xmath2 , which is responsible for a nonzero chiral charge density @xmath13 , i.e. to a nonzero imbalance between densities of left- and right - handed quarks ( fermions ) . in literature , there are some investigations of qcd - like effective theories with @xmath1 and @xmath2 chemical potentials , related to a possible parity breaking phenomena of dense quark gluon plasma ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , it was recently established that in heavy ion collision experiments a nonzero chiral charge density @xmath13 can be induced , leading to the so - called chiral magnetic effect @xcite .",
    "so , we hope that studying the above- mentioned ( 1 + 1)-dimensional njl model with two chemical potentials , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , one can shed new light on the new phenomena of the dense baryonic matter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii the duality property of the model is established .",
    "it means that there is a correspondence between properties ( phase structure ) of the model at @xmath3 and @xmath7 . after obtaining the thermodynamic potential ( tdp )",
    ", we will first investigate it in the next sec .",
    "iii under the supposition that both superconducting and chiral condensates are spatially homogeneous . in this section a rather rich @xmath6-phase structure of the model",
    "is established at @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , we will show here that there is an invariance of the tdp with respect to a duality transformation ( when @xmath14 , @xmath15 and superconductivity @xmath16 chiral symmetry breaking ) . as a result ,",
    "the @xmath6-phase structure of the model at @xmath3 is a dual mapping of the phase portrait at @xmath7 . in sec .",
    "iv the phase structure of the model is investigated in the assumption that both condensates might be spatially inhomogeneous .",
    "then at @xmath7 the chiral density wave phase is realized for arbitrary values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 . on the other hand , at @xmath3",
    "there is an inhomogeneous superconducting phase in the whole @xmath6 plane .",
    "note , that there is a dual correspondence between these phases .",
    "finally , sec .",
    "v presents a summary and some concluding remarks .",
    "the discussion of some technical problems are relegated to four appendixes .",
    "before studying the thermodynamics of the model , we want first of all to consider its duality property . to this end , it is very useful to form an infinite set @xmath50 composed of all lagrangians @xmath51 ( [ 3 ] ) when the free model parameters @xmath52 and @xmath2 take arbitrary admissible values , i.e. @xmath53 at arbitrary fixed values of coupling constants @xmath54 and chemical potentials @xmath55 .",
    "then , let us perform in ( [ 3 ] ) the so - called pauli - gursey transformation of spinor fields @xcite , accompanied with corresponding simultaneous transformations of auxiliary scalar fields ( [ 4 ] ) , @xmath56 taking into account that all spinor fields anticommute with each other , it is easy to see that under the action of the transformations ( [ 04 ] ) each element ( auxiliary lagrangian ) @xmath57 of the set @xmath50 is transformed into another element of the set @xmath50 according to the following rule @xmath58 i.e. the set @xmath50 is invariant under the field transformations ( [ 04 ] ) .",
    "owing to the relation ( [ 004 ] ) there is a connection between properties of the model when free model parameters @xmath52 and @xmath2 vary in different regions . due to this reason , we will call the relation ( [ 004 ] ) the duality property of the model .",
    "we begin an investigation of a phase structure of the four - fermion model ( 1 ) using the equivalent semibosonized lagrangian ( [ 3 ] ) . in the leading order of the large-@xmath11 approximation ,",
    "the effective action @xmath60 of the considered model is expressed by means of the path integral over fermion fields : @xmath61[d\\psi_l]\\exp\\bigl(i\\int { \\cal   l}\\,d^2 x\\bigr),\\ ] ] where @xmath62 + \\widetilde { \\cal s}_{\\rm { eff}}. \\label{5}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fermion contribution to the effective action , i.e.   the term @xmath63 in ( [ 5 ] ) , is given by @xmath64[d\\psi_l]\\exp\\bigl\\{i\\int\\big [ \\bar\\psi_k(\\gamma^\\nu i\\partial_\\nu + \\mu\\gamma^0+\\mu_5\\gamma^1-\\sigma - i\\gamma^5\\pi)\\psi_k -   \\frac{\\delta^{*}}{2}(\\psi_k^t\\epsilon\\psi_k ) -\\frac{\\delta}{2}(\\bar\\psi_k \\epsilon\\bar\\psi_k^t)\\big ] d^2 x\\bigr\\}. \\label{6}\\ ] ] the ground state expectation values @xmath65 , @xmath66 , etc . of the composite bosonic fields",
    "are determined by the saddle point equations , @xmath67 in vacuum , i.e. in the state corresponding to an empty space with zero particle density and zero values of the chemical potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the above - mentioned quantities @xmath65 , etc .",
    "do not depend on space coordinates .",
    "however , in a dense medium , when @xmath17 and/or @xmath68 , the ground state expectation values of bosonic fields ( [ 4 ] ) might have a nontrivial dependence on the spatial coordinate @xmath69 . in particular , in this paper we will use the following ansatz : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 are real constant quantities .",
    "( it means that we suppose for @xmath65 and @xmath66 the chiral spiral ( or chiral density wave ) ansatz , and the fulde - ferrel @xcite single plane wave ansatz for difermion condensates . ) in fact , they are coordinates of the global minimum point of the thermodynamic potential @xmath73 . ) , which lead to ground states with even lower values of the tdp . ] in the leading order of the large @xmath11-expansion it is defined by the following expression : @xmath74 which gives @xmath75[d\\psi_l]\\exp\\big ( i\\int d^2 x\\big [ \\bar\\psi_k { \\cal d}\\psi_k\\right.\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\left.- \\frac{\\delta\\exp(-2ib'x)}{2}(\\psi_k^t\\epsilon\\psi_k ) -\\frac{\\delta\\exp(2ib'x)}{2}(\\bar\\psi_k \\epsilon\\bar\\psi_k^t)\\big ] \\big ) \\right ) , \\label{9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath76 . in principle , one way to evaluate the path integral in ( [ 9 ] ) is to extend the technique of the paper @xcite , where a more simple model with single quark - antiquark channel of interaction was investigated , to the case under consideration , i.e. to the gn model ( 1 ) with additional superconducting interaction of quarks . the rigorous method of @xcite is based on finding the resolvent function corresponding to the hamiltonian of the system . however , technically it is very difficult to use this approach in the framework of the model ( 1 ) .",
    "so , in order to simplify the problem we first perform in ( [ 9 ] ) weinberg ( or chiral ) transformation of spinor fields @xcite , @xmath77\\psi_k$ ] and @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "since weinberg transformation of fermion fields does not change the path integral measure in ( [ 9 ] ) , ) , one can obtain in the path integral measure a factor , which however does not depend on the dynamical variables @xmath79 , @xmath72 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 .",
    "hence , we ignore this unessential factor in the following calculations .",
    "note that only in the case when there is an interaction between spinor and gauge fields there might appear a nontrivial , i.e. dependent on dynamical variables , path integral measure , generated by weinberg transformation of spinors .",
    "this unobvious fact follows from the investigations by fujikawa @xcite.[fujik ] ] we see that the system is reduced by the weinberg transformation from a spatially modulated to a uniform one ; i.e. we obtain the following expression for the thermodynamic potential : @xmath82[d q_l]\\exp\\big ( i\\int d^2 x\\big [ \\bar q_k   d q_k-\\frac{\\delta}{2}(q_k^t\\epsilon q_k ) -\\frac{\\delta}{2}(\\bar q_k \\epsilon\\bar q_k^t)\\big ] \\big ) \\right ) \\label{10},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath83 the path integration in the expression ( [ 10 ] ) is evaluated in appendix [ apa ] we consider for simplicity the case @xmath84 ; however the procedure is easily generalized to the case with @xmath85 . ] ( see also @xcite for similar integrals ) , so we have for the tdp @xmath86 , \\label{11}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath87 are presented in ( [ a8 ] ) and superscript  un  denotes the unrenormalized quantity .",
    "note , the tdp ( [ 11 ] ) describes thermodynamics of the model at zero temperature @xmath0 . in the following",
    "we will study the behavior of the global minimum point of this tdp as a function of dynamical variables @xmath88 vs the external parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 in two qualitatively different cases : ( i ) the case of homogeneous condensates , i.e. when in ( [ 8 ] ) and ( [ 11 ] ) both @xmath80 and @xmath81 are supposed from the very beginning , without any proof , to be zero , and ( ii ) the case of spatially inhomogeneous condensates , i.e. when the quantities @xmath80 and @xmath81 are defined dynamically by the gap equations of the tdp ( [ 11 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the influence of temperature @xmath0 on the phase structure is also taken into account .",
    "in the present section we suppose that all the condensates are spatially homogeneous , i.e. we put in the ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) and in the tdp ( [ 11 ] ) @xmath91 and @xmath92 .",
    "so , the tdp is considered _ a priori _ as a function of only two variables , @xmath79 and @xmath72 ( @xmath1 and @xmath2 are treated as external parameters ) .",
    "note that the subject and results of the section are largely preparatory for considering the main purpose of the paper , i.e. to clarify ( see the next section ) a genuine ground state structure of the model in the framework of the inhomogeneous ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) for condensates .",
    "taking into account the expressions ( [ a8 ] ) for @xmath87 , we obtain the unrenormalized tdp in this case : @xmath93 , \\label{25}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 expanding the right - hand side of ( [ 26 ] ) in powers of @xmath79 , one can obtain an equivalent expression for @xmath95 .",
    "namely , @xmath96 we would like to stress once more that there is an identical equality between the expressions ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "obviously , the function @xmath97 ( [ 25 ] ) is symmetric with respect to the transformations @xmath98 and/or @xmath99 . moreover , it is invariant under the transformations @xmath100 and/or @xmath101 . and/or @xmath101 transformations we perform in the integral ( [ 25 ] ) the following change of variables , @xmath102 and/or @xmath103",
    ", then one can easily see that the expression ( [ 26 ] ) remains intact .",
    "] hence , without loss of generality , we restrict ourselves by the constraints : @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107",
    ". however , there is one more discrete transformation of the tdp ( [ 25 ] ) , which leaves it invariant .",
    "it follows from a comparison between ( [ 26 ] ) and ( [ 27 ] ) .",
    "indeed , if in ( [ 26 ] ) for @xmath95 the transformations @xmath15 and @xmath108 are performed simultaneously , then the expression ( [ 27 ] ) will be obtained , which is equal to the original expression ( [ 26 ] ) for @xmath95 .",
    "so the tdp ( [ 25 ] ) is invariant with respect to the following duality transformation @xmath109 : @xmath110 taking into account that the tdp ( [ 25 ] ) is symmetric with respect to @xmath100 and/or @xmath101 , it is possible to conclude that the dual invariance @xmath109 of the tdp ( [ 25 ] ) is a particular realization of the dual property ( [ 004 ] ) of the initial model .",
    "suppose now that at some fixed particular values of the model parameters , i.e. at @xmath111 , @xmath112 and @xmath113 , @xmath114 , the global minimum point of the tdp lies at the point @xmath115 .",
    "then it follows from the dual invariance @xmath109 ( [ 28 ] ) of the tdp that the permutation of the coupling constant and chemical potential values ( i.e. at @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 , @xmath119 ) moves the global minimum point of the tdp to the point @xmath120 .",
    "in particular , if in the original model with @xmath111 , @xmath121 and @xmath113 , @xmath122 the global minimum point of the tdp lies at the point @xmath123 ( as a result , in this case the continuous chiral symmetry @xmath12 is spontaneously broken down ) , then in the model with @xmath124 , @xmath117 and @xmath125 , @xmath119 the global minimum point of the tdp lies at the point @xmath126 and the symmetry @xmath32 is spontaneously broken . the duality correspondence between these two particular cases of the original model ( 1 ) was discussed in @xcite .",
    "( even earlier , a special case with @xmath127 of the duality between chiral symmetry breaking and superconductivity phenomena was considered in the framework of the simplest two - dimensional gross - neveu model @xcite . ) hence , a knowledge of a phase structure of the model ( 1 ) at @xmath3 is sufficient to construct , by applying the duality transformation @xmath109 ( [ 28 ] ) , the phase structure at @xmath7 ; i.e. in the model under consideration there is a duality correspondence between chiral symmetry breaking and superconducting phases .    to investigate the tdp ( [ 25 ] ) it is necessary to renormalize it .",
    "first of all we will consider the renormalization procedure and the phase structure of the model in the vacuum case , i.e. when @xmath128 .",
    "putting @xmath125 and @xmath122 in ( [ 25 ] ) , we have in this case the following expression for the unrenormalized effective potential @xmath129 ( in vacuum tdp is usually called an effective potential ) : @xmath130 , \\label{29}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] integrating in ( [ 29 ] ) over @xmath131 ( see appendix b in @xcite for similar integrals ) and cutting the integration @xmath132 region , @xmath133 , one obtains the regularized effective potential @xmath134 : @xmath135 since this expression diverges at @xmath136 , it is necessary to renormalize it , assuming that @xmath137 and @xmath138 have appropriate @xmath139 dependencies . it is easy to establish that",
    "if @xmath140 where @xmath141 and @xmath142 are some finite and cutoff independent parameters with dimensionality of mass , then integrating in ( [ 30 ] ) over @xmath132 and ignoring there an unessential term -@xmath143 one can obtain in the limit @xmath136 a finite and renormalization invariant expression for the effective potential , @xmath144 now two remarks are in order .",
    "first , since @xmath141 and @xmath142 can be considered as free model parameters , it is clear that the renormalization procedure of the njl@xmath10 model ( 1 ) is accompanied by the dimensional transmutation phenomenon . indeed",
    ", there are two dimensionless bare coupling constants @xmath145 in the initial unrenormalized expression ( [ 29 ] ) for @xmath129 , whereas after renormalization the effective potential ( [ 22 ] ) is characterized by two dimensional , @xmath141 and @xmath142 , free model parameters .",
    "moreover , @xmath141 and @xmath142 are renormalization invariant quantities , i.e. they do not depend on the normalization points .",
    "( the physical sense of @xmath141 and @xmath142 will be discussed below . )",
    "second , the transposition @xmath14 of the bare coupling constants before renormalization is equivalent , as it is clear from ( [ 31 ] ) , to the transposition @xmath146 after renormalization procedure .",
    "hence , the vacuum effective potential @xmath147 ( [ 22 ] ) of the model is invariant with respect to the duality transformation ( [ 28 ] ) which now , i.e. in vacuum , looks like @xmath146 , @xmath108 .",
    "note also that the effective potential @xmath147 written in the form ( [ 22 ] ) has a singularity at @xmath148 , which is really fictitious .",
    "indeed , the expression ( [ 22 ] ) may be presented in an equivalent form that is more convenient for both numerical and analytical investigations : @xmath149 where @xmath150 the expression ( [ 220 ] ) is now a smooth function at @xmath148 .",
    "as it is clear from ( [ 220 ] ) , instead of two massive @xmath141 and @xmath142 parameters the renormalized model can be characterized by one massive and one dimensionless parameter @xmath141 and @xmath151 , respectively .",
    "( in this case only the partial dimensional transmutation phenomenon takes place . )",
    "just this set of parameters , i.e. @xmath141 and @xmath151 , was used in early investigations of the initial model ( 1 ) at @xmath122 @xcite . in spite of the fact that the dual invariance @xmath109 ( [ 28 ] ) of the effective potential in the form ( [ 220 ] ) , i.e. its symmetry with respect to simultaneous transformations @xmath146 and @xmath108 , is not so evident as in the form ( [ 22 ] ) , in the following we will treat the model properties in terms of the parameters @xmath141 and @xmath151 as well .",
    "so , if @xmath152 , i.e. , as is easily seen from ( [ 20 ] ) and ( [ 31 ] ) , at @xmath7 or @xmath153 , the global minimum of the effective potential ( [ 220 ] ) lies at the point @xmath154 .",
    "this means that if interaction in the fermion - antifermion channel is greater than that in the difermion one , then the chiral symmetry of the model is spontaneously broken down and fermions acquire dynamically a nonzero dirac mass , which is equal just to the free model parameter @xmath141 .",
    "further , in order to establish the phase structure of the model ( or , equivalently , to find the global minimum point of the function @xmath147 ) at @xmath155 , i.e. at @xmath3 , we do not need a straightforward analytical ( or numerical ) study of the function ( [ 220 ] ) on the extremum .",
    "in this case it is enough to take into account the dual invariance ( [ 28 ] ) of the tdp ( [ 25 ] ) ( at @xmath127 it is reduced to a symmetry of the effective potential @xmath147 with respect to simultaneous permutations @xmath146 , @xmath108 ) and conclude ( see also the discussion just after ( [ 28 ] ) ) that at @xmath155 the effective potential ( [ 220 ] ) has a global minimum at the point @xmath156 , where @xmath157 . since in this case only the difermion condensate , which is equal to @xmath142 , is nonzero , the fermion number @xmath158 symmetry is spontaneously broken and the superconducting phase is realized in the model . hence , the parameter @xmath142 is a majorana mass of fermions , which appears dynamically in superconducting phase of the model .",
    "taking into account the expression ( [ b9 ] ) ( see appendix b ) , in this case the unrenormalized tdp ( [ 25 ] ) can be presented in the following form @xmath161 where quasiparticle and quasiantiparticle energies @xmath162 , @xmath163 and @xmath164 , @xmath165 , respectively , are presented in ( [ b41 ] ) .",
    "it is shown in appendix b ( see the text below formula ( [ b071 ] ) ) how one can find the asymptotic expansion of the integrand in ( [ 32 ] ) at @xmath166 . as a consequence of this prescription",
    "we have obtained the asymptotic expansions ( [ b26 ] ) and , as a result , the following @xmath166 expansion : @xmath167 it means that the integral in ( [ 32 ] ) is an ultraviolet ( uv ) divergent , so we need to renormalize the tdp @xmath97 . using the momentum cutoff regularization scheme ,",
    "we obtain @xmath168 where @xmath169 is given in ( [ 30 ] ) .",
    "note that the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion ( [ 33 ] ) do not depend on @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "so the quantity @xmath170 has the same asymptotic expansion ( [ 33 ] ) at @xmath166 .",
    "hence , the integral term in ( [ 23 ] ) is a convergent one , and all uv divergences are located in the first term @xmath169 .",
    "the uv divergences are eliminated , if the @xmath139 dependencies ( [ 31 ] ) of the bare coupling constants @xmath4 and @xmath5 are supposed . in this case",
    "we have from ( [ 23 ] ) at @xmath136 the following expression for the renormalized tdp : @xmath171 where @xmath147 is the tdp ( effective potential ) ( [ 22])-([220 ] ) of the model at @xmath125 and @xmath122 .",
    "let us denote by @xmath172 the global minimum point ( gmp ) of the tdp ( [ 35 ] ) . then , investigating the behavior of this point vs @xmath1 and @xmath2 it is possible to construct the @xmath6-phase portrait ( diagram ) of the model .",
    "a numerical algorithm for finding the quasi(anti)particle energies @xmath162 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 , and @xmath165 is elaborated in appendix b. based on this , it can be shown numerically that gmp of the tdp can never be of the form @xmath173 .",
    "hence , at arbitrary fixed values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , i.e. at arbitrary values of @xmath151 ( [ 20 ] ) , it is enough to study the projections @xmath174 and @xmath175 of the tdp ( [ 35 ] ) to the @xmath79 and @xmath72 axes , correspondingly .",
    "taking into account the relations ( [ 36 ] ) and ( [ 37 ] ) for the sum @xmath176 at @xmath177 or @xmath178 , it is possible to obtain the following expressions for these quantities , @xmath179 ( details of the derivation of these expressions are given in appendix [ apd ] . )",
    "now , to find the gmp of the whole tdp ( [ 35 ] ) and , as a consequence , to obtain the phase structure of the model , it is sufficient to compare the minimal values of the functions ( [ 350 ] ) and ( [ 035 ] ) .",
    "recall that , up to an unessential constant , each of the functions @xmath180 and @xmath181 is just a well - known tdp of the usual massless gross - neveu model at zero temperature and nonzero chemical potential .",
    "it was investigated , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "so , one can conclude that at @xmath182 ( @xmath183 ) the gmp of the function @xmath180 ( of the function @xmath184 ) ) lies at the point @xmath185 ( at the point @xmath186 ) . whereas at @xmath187 ( at @xmath188 ) the gmp is at the point @xmath178 ( @xmath177 ) .",
    "moreover , the corresponding minimal values are the following : @xmath189 comparing the least values ( [ 0035 ] ) of the tdps ( [ 350 ] ) and ( [ 035 ] ) for different values of the chemical potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 , it is possible to obtain the @xmath6-phase portrait of the model , which consists of only three phases , the chiral symmetry breaking phase , the superconducting phase and , finally , symmetrical phase .",
    "moreover , it is evident that in the csb phase the gmp of the tdp ( [ 35 ] ) has the form @xmath190 , and in the sc phase it lies at the point @xmath191 , whereas in the symmetrical phase the least value of the tdp ( [ 35 ] ) is reached at the point @xmath192 .",
    "note that the phase structure of the model depends essentially on the relation between @xmath141 and @xmath142 .",
    "indeed , let us first suppose that @xmath153 . in this case the typical @xmath6-phase portrait of the model is presented in fig .",
    "it is evident that the region @xmath193 of the figure corresponds to the symmetrical phase of the model .",
    "moreover , in the region @xmath194 ( in the region @xmath195 ) of the figure the csb phase ( the sc phase ) is arranged .",
    "the competition between csb and sc phases takes place in the region @xmath196 .",
    "namely , the critical curve @xmath197 of fig . 1 is defined by the equation @xmath198 ,",
    "i.e. by the equation @xmath199 the curve @xmath197 divides this region into two subregions . to the left of @xmath197 the csb phase",
    "is arranged , whereas to the right of @xmath197 we have the sc phase .",
    "furthermore , it is clear from ( [ 0350 ] ) and ( [ 0035 ] ) that it is possible to obtain an exact analytical expression for @xmath197 , @xmath200    in a similar way it is possible to construct a @xmath6-phase portrait of the model when @xmath201 ( the typical @xmath6-phase portrait is presented in fig .",
    "the critical curve @xmath202 of the figure is given by the relation @xmath203 finally , if @xmath204 , then the typical @xmath6-phase portrait of the model is given in fig .",
    "3 .    suppose that the values of @xmath141 and @xmath142 , for which the phase portrait of fig . 2 is drawn , are obtained by rearrangement of the corresponding @xmath141 , @xmath142 values for which fig",
    ". 1 is depicted ( and vice versa ) .",

    "3 , i.e. at @xmath217 .",
    "\\(3 ) if a spatially inhomogeneous behavior of condensates is assumed in the form ( [ 8 ] ) , where the parameters @xmath80 and @xmath81 must be found by gap equations , then the @xmath6-phase structure of the model is considerably simplified . indeed , in this case at @xmath7 ,",
    "i.e. at @xmath153 , ( at @xmath3 ) only the inhomogeneous chiral density wave phase ( only inhomogeneous sc phase ) is realized in the model for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . the critical temperature , at which the inhomogeneous chiral density wave phase ( the inhomogeneous sc phase ) is destroyed and the symmetrical phase appears , is equal to @xmath311 ( equal to @xmath319 ) .",
    "( in contrast , if @xmath80 and @xmath81 are equal to zero _ a priori _ , i.e. condensates",
    "are assumed to be homogeneous from the very beginning , then , depending on the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath2 , spatially uniform csb and sc phases are present on a model phase portrait both at @xmath7 and @xmath3 ( see , e.g. , figs 1 , 2 ) . )",
    "note also that if @xmath331 , then the inhomogeneous chiral density wave phase is a dual mapping of the inhomogeneous sc phase and vice versa .",
    "moreover , in this case the degeneracy between the above - mentioned inhomogeneous phases is absent .",
    "\\(4 ) it is interesting to note that at @xmath8 and for arbitrary fixed values of the chemical potentials @xmath1 and @xmath2 the self - dual and degenerated phase portrait of the above - mentioned inhomogeneous phases appears .",
    "it means that for each fixed value of @xmath1 and @xmath2 there is an equal opportunity for the emergence as one or the other inhomogeneous phase in the system .",
    "moreover , the coexistence of these phases is not excluded .",
    "in contrast , in the homogeneous case of the ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) for condensates the degeneration between csb and sc ground states of the model is absent ( at @xmath330 ) , in spite of a self - dual phase portrait of the model at @xmath8 ( see fig .",
    "\\(5 ) note that if the condesates are homogeneous and @xmath59 , then in the csb phase the particle density @xmath220 is identically zero , whereas the chiral charge density @xmath13 vanishes in the sc phase ( see ( [ 410 ] ) and ( [ 0410 ] ) ) .",
    "however , if a possibility of spatial inhomogeneity for condensates in the form ( [ 8 ] ) is taken into account , then both in the ground state corresponding to an inhomogeneous chiral density wave phase and in the inhomogeneous sc phase the nonzero particle number density , @xmath332 , and nonzero chiral charge density , @xmath333 , appear .",
    "moreover , at @xmath308 and in the case of inhomogeneous ansatz ( [ 8 ] ) for condensates both particle density @xmath220 and chiral charge density @xmath13 do not depend on temperature and have the same behaviors ( [ t ] ) in all possible phases of the model , symmetrical , inhomogeneous chiral density wave , and inhomogeneous superconducting phases .",
    "we are aware of the fact that some of the above properties ( such as the appearance of an inhomogeneous phase at arbitrarily low chemical potentials or a change of the nature of the inhomogeneous phase ( csb vs sc ) if the sc coupling becomes larger than the csb one ) are peculiarities of the above - considered ( 1 + 1)-dimensional model ( 1 ) and , perhaps , have no relation to reality . however , there are results ( e.g. the extension of inhomogeneous phases to high values of chemical potentials ) that are predicted by ( 3 + 1)-dimensional qcd - like models as well @xcite .",
    "it is also worth noting that in the recent paper @xcite the ( 3 + 1)-dimensional njl model with several quark - antiquark interaction channels was investigated at zero temperature and in the presence of two chemical potentials , @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "the only homogeneous ansatz for condensates is taken into account in this research , which is devoted to the study of the parity breaking effects in qcd at high densities .",
    "as it was established there , in dense quark matter , i.e. at @xmath17 , and at a rather high values of @xmath2 the chiral symmetry breaking+parity breaking phase is allowed to exist ( see fig . 7 in this paper ) . in some ways our work is related to the same problem , but only considered in the framework of a simple njl@xmath10 toy model ( 1 )",
    "indeed , we have shown that at @xmath320 and @xmath7 an inhomogeneous csb phase , in which parity is also spontaneously broken down , is realized in the model ( 1 ) .",
    "so , there is an alternative mechanism to achieve parity breaking in dense qcd , based on spatially nonuniform condensates . in this approach",
    "is simply to supply a nonzero chiral charge density @xmath333 ( [ t ] ) in the chiral density wave phase , where both parity and chiral symmetry are broken spontaneously .",
    "] moreover , we have demonstrated that , in comparison with the njl model @xcite , a reduced number of quark - antiquark channels of interaction is needed in order to obtain spontaneous parity and chiral symmetry breaking at @xmath17 .",
    "finally , note that inhomogeneous phases are observed in a phase diagram of the njl@xmath10 model ( 1 ) only at small temperatures , i.e. at @xmath320 if @xmath7 or at @xmath322 if @xmath3 . at high temperatures the symmetric phase with @xmath334 and , especially , with nonzero chiral charge density @xmath13",
    "is realized ( see in sec .",
    "it is well known that in a heavy ion collision scenario both the temperature and magnetic field can be extremely high .",
    "due to high temperatures a sphaleron transition might occur , which is accompanied by an appearance of a nonzero chiral density @xmath13 ( or chemical potential @xmath68 ) in the system @xcite . due to strong magnetic fields the dynamics of the system becomes essentially one dimensional .",
    "so we believe that in the high temperature region the model ( 1 ) reflects in some details the physics of quark - gluon plasma and , furthermore , the ( 1 + 1)-dimensional models with @xmath2-chemical potential deserve to be investigated .",
