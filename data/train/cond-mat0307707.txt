    "single - molecule magnets ( smms ) have been extensively studied for the past decade because of both scientific and practical reasons : macroscopic quantum phenomena@xcite and possible utilization as magnetic storage devices.@xcite a prototype of the smms is [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(ch@xmath4coo)@xmath5(h@xmath6o)@xmath3 ] @xmath82(ch@xmath4cooh)@xmath84(h@xmath6o ) ( hereafter mn@xmath0),@xcite which is a three - dimensional array of identical @xmath1 molecules .",
    "very recently , derivatized mn@xmath0 type molecules were successfully deposited on a gold film,@xcite which further enhances the prospects for storing magnetic information in a single molecule .",
    "a single molecule of mn@xmath0 has four ferromagnetically coupled mn@xmath9 ions ( @xmath10 ) in the cubane and eight ferromagnetically coupled mn@xmath11 ions ( @xmath12 ) in the crown as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mn12sch ] . in the ground state ,",
    "the magnetic moments of the eight mn@xmath11 ions are antiparallel to those of the four mn@xmath9 ions which leads to a total spin of @xmath1 .",
    "so far many interesting features of the smm mn@xmath0 such as magnetization steps in the hysteresis loops,@xcite electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) transitions,@xcite and low - energy excitations in inelastic neutron scattering,@xcite have been well understood by considering each molecule as an object with an effective spin of @xmath1 .",
    "however , magnetic susceptibility measurements@xcite have demonstrated that some experimental data could not be in accord with the @xmath1 single - spin picture and suggested that the first excited - state manifold may be located at 35  k@xmath1340  k above the @xmath1 ground - state manifold within which the energy barrier to magnetization reversal is 65  k in zero field . since the first excited - state manifold overlaps with the ground - state manifold above 35  k@xmath1340  k , an internal many - spin structure of a single molecule",
    "should be included to explain the high - energy experimental data .",
    "the dimension of the hilbert space of this smm is so large that a simplified eight - spin model with strong dzyaloshinsky - morya interaction was first proposed to include many - spin effects by dimerizing two strongly bonded mn spins.@xcite although this eight - spin model explained some experimental data , it was limited to features below 50  k. at higher temperatures the dimerization scheme breaks down .",
    "later all twelve mn spins were included in the heisenberg hamiltonian and excited - state manifolds were clarified by diagonalization of the hamiltonian with constraining the fixed energy gap between the first excited - state and the ground - state manifold of 35  k.@xcite nonetheless , there is still a big controversy over the energy gap between the first excited - state and the ground - state manifold , and there has been less exploration of high - energy features caused by many - spin effects .",
    "here `` high - energy '' means low - lying excited manifolds above the @xmath1 ground - state manifold .",
    "recent high - energy inelastic neutron scattering measurements exhibited a broad anomalous peak at 10  k , which may have a magnetic origin ( not due to phonons ) and could not be rationalized by the @xmath1 single - spin picture because the first allowed peak by the picture is about 14  k.@xcite more recent high - field epr measurements revealed that several transitions could not be justified by the @xmath1 single - spin manifold but that they were well explained if we assumed the @xmath2 first excited - state manifold to be situated at 10 - 16  k above the ground - state manifold.@xcite additionally , there have been many attempts to determine the signs and magnitudes of the exchange couplings between mn ions from different approaches@xcite but no consensus has arisen .    to elucidate the energy gap and examine properties within the low - energy excited manifolds , a single molecule of the mn@xmath0",
    "is considered and the exchange interactions between mn spins are calculated using density - functional theory ( dft ) , which are presented in secs .",
    "ii and iii .",
    "our calculated values are compared with those from other groups.@xcite through diagonalization of the isotropic heisenberg exchange hamiltonian with our calculated exchange constants using the lanczos method,@xcite excited - state manifolds are manifested and energy gaps between different manifolds are calculated in sec .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy barriers for low - energy spin excitations are calculated using dft and the anisotropy barriers for low - lying excited manifolds are discussed in sec .  v. our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "our dft calculations@xcite are performed with spin - polarized all - electron gaussian - orbital - based naval research laboratory molecular orbital library ( nrlmol ) @xcite which is ideal for studying a single molecule to a small number of unit cells .",
    "here we use the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) generalized - gradient approximation ( gga ) in the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite since the smm mn@xmath0 has fourfold symmetry , for fully symmetrized calculations the total number of inequivalent atoms to consider is reduced to @xmath14 . to save geometry - optimization time without losing interesting physical properties , the following simplified form of the smm mn@xmath0",
    "is used : [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(hcoo)@xmath5(h@xmath6o)@xmath3 ] ( acetic acids and water molecules of crystallization are not included , and 16 acetates , ch@xmath4coo , are replaced by 16 formates , hcoo ) . the zero - field total anisotropy barrier for the @xmath1 ground - state manifold does not change much with this simplification .",
    "the total magnetic moment for the ground state was confirmed to be @xmath15 , which is in good agreement with experiment and it is stable .",
    "details of the optimization schemes and electronic properties of the optimized geometry for the ground state were discussed elsewhere.@xcite hereafter , unless specified , our calculations have been carried out for the above simplified form .",
    "the fourfold symmetry and the geometry of a single mn@xmath0 molecule indicate that there are three symmetrically inequivalent mn sites and four different exchange interactions between mn spins as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mn12sch ] . to calculate the exchange constants using dft",
    ", it is assumed that the magnetic moments of all mn ions are aligned along a particular direction ( collinear )",
    ". then eleven distinctive spin configurations are constructed by reversing magnetic moments of a few mn ions simultaneously from the @xmath1 ground - state .",
    "( see table  [ table:1 ] ) for example , a @xmath16 state ( @xmath17 is an eigenvalue of the total spin operator @xmath18 projected along the particular direction ) can be built by flipping both one mn spin in the cubane and another mn spin in the crown within the @xmath1 ground state : @xmath19 .",
    "there are several ways to construct @xmath16 states with collinear spins that are labeled as 9-b , 9-c , and 9-d in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "all of the examined collinear spin configurations are _ not _ eigenstates of @xmath20 .",
    "mean - field calculations are not directly applicable to optimizing excited states such as @xmath21 in mn@xmath0 , because those eigenstates are represented by linear combinations of many single slater determinants .",
    "the geometries for the distinctive spin configurations are taken to be the same as that for the ground state except for the proper spin arrangements .",
    "it is confirmed that a slightly different initial geometry for the collinear spin configurations does not siginificantly alter our calculated values of the exchange constants . since fourfold symmetry",
    "is broken for the spin configurations considered , unsymmetrized calculations are required with a total number of 100 atoms .",
    "the energies of the spin configurations are self - consistently minimized with a small basis set and fine mesh.@xcite our calculations show that the minimized energies range from 0.04  ev to 0.2  ev above the ground - state ferrimagnetic structure . from ref .",
    "it is known that for the @xmath1 ground state the lowest electronic excitation is a majority spin excitation between the @xmath22 levels in mn(3d ) states , which is about 0.44  ev ( majority lumo - homo gap ) , and that the energy gap between minority lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) and majority highest occupied molecular orbital ( homo ) is @xmath23  ev .",
    "comparison of the minimized energies to the lumo - homo gaps indicates that these different spin configurations are lower - energy spin excitations than moving an electron from the majority homo to the unoccupied majority ( or minority ) orbital .",
    "thus they will be called low - energy spin excitations .",
    "there are twelve equations to solve for five unknowns ( the background energy , @xmath24 , four exchange constants @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 ) so a least - square - fit ( lsf ) method@xcite is used .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath29 s are shown in table  [ table:2 ] in comparison with results of other groups . when the minimized energies of the low - energy spin excitations are recalculated using the calculated values of @xmath29 s , it is found that they are in good agreement with the dft - calculated energies as indicated in table  [ table:1 ] .",
    "prior to comparison to the results of other groups , let us briefly review the essence of the different approaches from the different groups . in ref .",
    "the value of @xmath25 was first determined from the experimental data , and then @xmath26 and @xmath27 were varied with fixed value of @xmath30 to reproduce the @xmath1 ground state . in ref .",
    "the values of @xmath29 s were slightly varied from the previously reported values@xcite using diagonalization of heisenberg exchange hamiltonian to provide the @xmath1 ground state and the energy gap of 35  k between the ground - state and the @xmath2 first excited - state manifold . in ref .",
    "the exchange parameters were obtained to reproduce their megagauss experimental data with a constraint of the energy gap of 35  k. in ref .",
    "the lda@xmath31u method was used to include electron correlations between mn ions , and the values of the intra - atomic hund s exchange parameter @xmath29 and the average coulomb parameter @xmath32 were determined to obtain the correct magnetic moment for the @xmath1 ground state .",
    "then the exchange constants were calculated from the values of @xmath29 and @xmath32 .",
    "our calculations show that the coupling between one mn spin in the cubane and another mn spin in the crown closest to the mn spin in the cubane , @xmath25 , is confirmed to be the strongest antiferromagnetic coupling , although its absolute magnitude does not agree among different groups .",
    "our calculated value of @xmath25 agrees somewhat with those from refs .  .",
    "the coupling between a mn spin in the cubane and the other type of mn spin in the crown , @xmath26 , is confirmed to be weaker antiferromagnetic than @xmath25 .",
    "but the rate of @xmath26 to @xmath25 does not agree among different groups .",
    "our value of @xmath26 is between the values obtained from refs .  .",
    "the coupling between mn spins in the cubane , @xmath27 , turns out to be the weakest and is ferromagnetic .",
    "the coupling between mn spins in the crown , @xmath28 , is weakly antiferromagnetic .",
    "overall , the dft calculated values are closest to the results obtained from ref .  , and they are 20%-40% larger than those from the lda@xmath31u method except for the weakest @xmath27",
    ". however , they are significantly smaller than the other two reported results from refs .  .",
    "our calculated values of @xmath29 may be overestimated compared to experimental data for the following reasons .",
    "it has been found from other smms such as mn@xmath3[ref .  ] and v@xmath33[ref .  ]",
    "that the dft - calculated exchange interactions were overestimated by a factor of 2 and 3 compared to the experimental data respectively.@xcite this overestimated exchange interactions are due to the fact that the pbe generalized - gradient approximation does not fully treat self - interaction corrections of the localized @xmath34 states in the coulomb potential .",
    "proper treatment of the electron correlations in mn atoms may improve our dft calculations of the exchange interactions .",
    "this is supported by the fact that the lda@xmath31u method produces 20%-40% smaller exchange interactions than our dft calculations and that the exchange interactions decrease with increasing the value of @xmath32 in the lda@xmath31u method.@xcite",
    "to calculate the energy gap between the ground - state and the first excited manifold , we use the following isotropic ( i.e. no anisotropy ) heisenberg exchange hamiltonian : @xmath35 where the sum runs over all pairs connected by the exchange interactions and the values of the coupling constants @xmath36 labeled in fig.[fig : mn12sch ] are in table  [ table:2 ] .",
    "the exchange hamiltonian is a @xmath37 matrix , which is too large to diagonalize using currently available computers .",
    "thus , using the fact that @xmath17 is a good quantum number , we classify the total number of the @xmath38 states into 45 different constant @xmath17 states such as @xmath39 .",
    "since we are interested in low - lying excited manifolds , we examine @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 states only . if the @xmath1 manifold is the ground state , then the lowest - energy eigenstate of the exchange hamiltonian with a basis set of all @xmath42 states corresponds to @xmath45 .",
    "additionally the lowest - energy eigenstate of the hamiltonian with a basis set of all @xmath43 states corresponds to @xmath46 and it should have the same energy as @xmath45 .",
    "the eigenstates with the same @xmath18 must be degenerate if they belong to the same manifold .",
    "the first - excited eigenstate of the hamiltonian with the basis set of all @xmath43 states corresponds to @xmath47 if the @xmath2 manifold is the first - excited manifold above the @xmath1 ground state .",
    "there are a total number of 269148 @xmath48 states , 484144 @xmath41 states , 817176 @xmath42 states , and 1299632 @xmath43 states , 1954108 @xmath44 states .",
    "we diagonalize the full hamiltonian matrices for the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 states using the lanczos method.@xcite a few calculated low - lying energy eigenvalues are shown in table  [ table:3 ] .",
    "the lowest energy for the @xmath42 states is identical to those for the @xmath43 and @xmath44 states , but it is much lower than the lowest energies for the @xmath41 and @xmath40 states .",
    "the lowest energies for the @xmath49 states will increase with increasing @xmath50 .",
    "this indicates that the ground - state has @xmath1 .",
    "next higher energies are from the @xmath43 and @xmath44 states .",
    "the three excited energy eigenvalues for the @xmath43 states coincide with those for the @xmath44 states which are much lower than the excited energies for the @xmath42 , @xmath41 , and @xmath40 states .",
    "this suggests that the three excited states for the @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) states belong to @xmath2 manifolds .",
    "so the first excited - state manifold has @xmath2 located at 40.5  k above the @xmath1 ground state , and there are two more @xmath2 excited manifolds located at 7  k and 40  k above the @xmath2 first excited manifold ( fig .",
    "[ fig : elevel ] ) .",
    "our calculated values of the energy gaps are upper limits because dft calculations may overestimate the exchange interactions due to the reasons discussed in sec .",
    "if the exchange constants are reduced by a half , then the energy gaps will be also reduced by a half .",
    "single - ion anisotropy parameters which we did not include in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ham_ms ] ) does not significantly affect the energy gap .",
    "the magnetic anisotropy barriers for the eleven low - energy spin excitations as well as the ground state are calculated with the assumption that the barriers are caused by the spin - orbit interaction only .",
    "other effects such as noncollinearity of the magnetic moments of mn ions and spin - orbit - vibron coupling@xcite on the anisotropy barrier will not be included in our study .",
    "however correlation effects due to the addition of multideterminantal wavefunctions are addressed in part by the further ongoing discussion .",
    "the spin - orbit interaction @xmath51 can be decomposed into one - electron operators @xmath52 related to the electric fields caused by nuclei and two - electron operators @xmath53 related to the electric fields due to the rest of electrons as follows : @xmath54 where the summation for @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) runs over all electrons located at @xmath57 ( all nuclei located at @xmath58 with nuclear number @xmath59 ) , @xmath60 is the speed of light , @xmath61 is the spin operator of the @xmath55th electron , and @xmath62 is the momentum of the @xmath55th electron . within the self - consistent field ( scf )",
    "approximation , we have calculated the wave function @xmath63 satisfying @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the many - electron hamiltonian without spin - orbit coupling , @xmath66 is a spatial function and @xmath67 is a spinor .",
    "therefore , the energy shift , @xmath68 , due to @xmath51 using second - order perturbation theory is written by@xcite @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the energy of the occupied state with spinor @xmath71 , and @xmath72 is the energy of the unoccupied state with spinor @xmath73 .",
    "the summation runs over all occupied and unoccupied states of all atoms within a certain energy window and over up and down spinor states .",
    "the contributions for the cases that both of @xmath55 and @xmath74 are occupied ( or unoccupied ) to the energy shift cancel each other out . for uniaxial systems such as mn@xmath0 the second - order energy shift is simplified as follows : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the uniaxial anisotropy parameter which can be calculated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta2 ] ) . for the @xmath1 ground state ,",
    "as shown in table  [ table:1 ] the uniaxial parameter is about 0.54  k , which is in good agreement with experiment.@xcite    an eigenstate @xmath77 of the many - electron hamiltonian that belongs to an excited - state manifold can be written in terms of a linear combination of many slater determinants : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a single slater determinant ( orthonormal basis function ) , and some of @xmath79 correspond to our examined low - energy spin excitations .",
    "therefore , the expectation value of the spin - orbit coupling @xmath51 with respect to @xmath77 , is decomposed into diagonal and off - diagonal elements such as @xmath80 where the summations run over spatial coordinates and spin variables of all electrons in mn@xmath0 .",
    "@xmath51 is made of one - electron and two - electron operators as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vls-2 ] ) . to facilitate calculations of the diagonal and off - diagonal elements ,",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the one - electron operator , @xmath81 , are explicitly written in terms of single - electron spin - orbitals .",
    "@xcite @xmath82 where @xmath83 is also applied to the single - electron spin - orbitals and the normalization factor @xmath84 cancels out @xmath85 permutations of the @xmath86 single - electron spin - orbitals in @xmath87 . as can be seen from eq .",
    "( [ eq : vls-7 ] ) , because all spin - orbitals @xmath88,@xmath89 @xmath90 , @xmath91,@xmath89 , @xmath92 , are orthonormal to each other , the off - diagonal elements of the one - electron operator @xmath52 are nonvanishing when only one single - electron spin - orbital is different between @xmath79 and @xmath93 .",
    "the off - diagonal elements of the two - electron operator @xmath53 are nonvanishing when no more than two single - electron spin - orbitals are different between @xmath79 and @xmath93 .",
    "different single slater determinants ( or different low - energy spin excitations ) are not connected by the one- or two - electron operators , so @xmath94 for @xmath95 .",
    "hence , the off - diagonal contributions to the energy shift @xmath68 is zero .",
    "as shown in table  [ table:1 ] , the calculated magnetic anisotropy barriers for the low - energy spin excitations are almost the same as that for the ground state @xmath1 manifold .",
    "this indicates that the diagonal elements of the spin - orbit interaction [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : vls-6 ] ) ] do not vary much with different spin excitations : @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "then @xmath98 where @xmath99 by definition .",
    "so the magnetic anisotropy barriers for low - lying excited - state manifolds must be approximately the same as that for the ground - state manifold .",
    "note that we have calculated second - order anisotropy barriers only so that the barriers shown in table  [ table:1 ] are all between 54  k and 55  k. the results of this discussion suggest that the dft - based determination of mae is valid under the following conditions : ( i ) single - electron and two - electron excitations cost an order of ev , ( ii ) considered collinear spin excitations cost an order of magnitude less energy than the single - electron and two - electron excitations .",
    "we have calculated the intramolecular exchange interactions among mn spins in the single - molecule magnet mn@xmath0 ( [ mn@xmath0o@xmath0(hcoo)@xmath5(h@xmath6o)@xmath3 ] ) considering localized low - energy spin excitations using density - functional theory .",
    "our calculated values of the exchange constants agree with the results from refs .  .",
    "with our calculated exchange constants , we have diagonalized the isotropic heisenberg hamiltonian using the lanczos method .",
    "we have confirmed that the ground state is @xmath1 and that there is a @xmath2 first - excited manifold located at 40.5  k above the @xmath1 ground - state manifold .",
    "this energy gap ( 40.5  k ) is an upper limit because it is likely reduced by including more exact treatments of the coulomb potential or electron correlations .",
    "this indicates that the first excited manifold may be situated much lower than the high energy levels within the @xmath1 ground - state manifold .",
    "we have also calculated the magnetic anisotropy barriers for the low - energy spin excitations using dft and the second - order perturbation theory with the assumption that the spin - orbit coupling is the most important interaction .",
    "our dft calculations have showed that the anisotropy barriers for the low - energy spin excitations are approximately the same as that for the @xmath1 ground state . from this result and our understanding of the spin - orbit interaction",
