    "the last century was characterized by three great successes in the field of astrophysics , each one linked to a different energy source :    1 .",
    "jean @xcite and arthur @xcite were the first to point out , independently , that the nuclear fusion of four hydrogen nuclei into one helium nucleus could explain the energy production in stars .",
    "this idea was put on a solid theoretical base by robert atkinson and fritz houtermans @xcite using george gamow s quantum theory of barrier penetration @xcite further developed by c.f .",
    "@xcite . the monumental theoretical work by hans @xcite , and later by @xcite ,",
    "completed the understanding of the basic role of nuclear energy generated by fusion processes in explaining the energy source of main sequence stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "pulsars , especially np0532 at the center of the crab nebula , were discovered by jocelyn bell and tony hewish @xcite , and many theorists were actively trying to explain them as rotating neutron stars ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these had already been predicted by george gamow using newtonian physics @xcite and by robert julius oppenheimer and students using general relativity @xcite .",
    "the crucial evidence confirming that pulsars were neutron stars came when their energetics was understood @xcite .",
    "the following relation was established from the observed pulsar period @xmath7 and its always positive first derivative @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the observed pulsar bolometric luminosity , @xmath11 is its moment of inertia derived from the neutron star theory .",
    "this has to be related to the observed pulsar period .",
    "this equation not only identifies the role of neutron stars in explaining the nature of pulsars , but clearly indicates the rotational energy of neutron star as the pulsar energy source .",
    "the birth of x - ray astronomy thanks to riccardo giacconi and his group ( see e.g. @xcite ) led to a still different energy source , originating from the accretion of matter onto a star which has undergone a complete gravitational collapse process : a black hole ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this case , the energetics is dominated by the radiation emitted in the accretion process of matter around an already formed black hole .",
    "luminosities up to @xmath12 times the solar luminosity , much larger then the ones of pulsars , could be explained by the release of energy in matter accreting in the deep potential well of a black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "this allowed to probe for the first time the structure of circular orbits around a black hole computed by ruffini and wheeler ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this result was well illustrated by the theoretical interpretation of the observations of cygnus - x1 , obtained by the uhuru satellite and by the optical and radio telescopes on the ground ( see fig . [ cygx1 ] ) .",
    "these three results clearly exemplify how the identification of the energy source is the crucial factor in reaching the understanding of any astrophysical or physical phenomenon .",
    "of @xmath12 solar luminosities points to the accretion process into a neutron star or a black hole as the energy source .",
    "the absence of pulsation is naturally explained either by a non - magnetized neutron star or a kerr - newman black hole , which has necessarily to be axially symmetric .",
    "what identifies the black hole unambiguously is that the mass of cygnus x-1 , observed to be larger than @xmath13 , exceeds the absolute upper limit of the neutron star mass , estimated at @xmath14 by @xcite . ]",
    "the discovery of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) may well sign a further decisive progress .",
    "grbs can give in principle the first opportunity to probe and observe a yet different form of energy : the extractable energy of the black hole introduced in 1971 ( @xcite ) , which we shall refer in the following as the blackholic energy .",
    "the blackholic energy , expected to be emitted during the dynamical process of gravitational collapse leading to the formation of the black hole , generates x- and @xmath0-ray luminosities @xmath15 times larger than the solar luminosity , which manifest themselves in the grb phenomenon . in the very short time they last , grbs are comparable with the full electromagnetic luminosity of the entire visible universe .",
    "we recall how grbs were detected and studied for the first time using the _ vela _ satellites , developed for military research to monitor the non - violation of the limited test ban treaty signed in 1963 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "it was clear from the early data of these satellites , which were put at @xmath16 miles from the surface of earth , that the grbs originated neither on the earth nor in the solar system .",
    "this discovery luckily occurred when the theoretical understanding of gravitationally collapsed objects , as well as the quantum electrodynamics of the vacuum polarization process , had already reached full maturity .",
    "three of the most important works in the field of general relativity have certainly been the discovery of the kerr solution @xcite , its generalization to the charged case ( @xcite ) and the formulation by brandon carter @xcite of the hamilton - jacobi equations for a charged test particle in the metric and electromagnetic field of a kerr - newman solution ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the equations of motion , which are generally second order differential equations , were reduced by carter to a set of first order differential equations which were then integrated by using an effective potential technique by ruffini and wheeler for the kerr metric ( see e.g. @xcite ) and by ruffini for the reissner - nordstrm geometry ( @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ effp ] ) .",
    "all the above mathematical results were essential for understanding the new physics of gravitationally collapsed objects and allowed the publication of a very popular article : `` introducing the black hole '' ( @xcite ) . in that paper , is was advanced the ansatz that the most general black hole is a solution of the einstein - maxwell equations , asymptotically flat and with a regular horizon : the kerr - newman solution .",
    "such a solution is characterized only by three parameters : the mass @xmath17 , the charge @xmath18 and the angular momentum @xmath19 .",
    "this ansatz of the `` black hole uniqueness theorem '' still today after thirty years presents challenges to the mathematical aspects of its complete proof ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite ) . in addition to the challenges due to the above mathematical difficulties , in the field of physics this ansatz contains most profound consequences .",
    "the fact that , among all the possible highly nonlinear terms characterizing the gravitationally collapsed objects , only the ones corresponding solely to the einstein maxwell equations survive the formation of the horizon has , indeed , extremely profound physical implications .",
    "any departure from such a minimal configuration either collapses on the horizon or is radiated away during the collapse process .",
    "this ansatz is crucial in identifying precisely a standard process of gravitational collapse leading to the formation of the black hole and the emission of grbs . indeed , in this specific case , the born - like nonlinear @xcite terms of the heisenberg - euler - schwinger @xcite lagrangian are radiated away prior to the formation of the horizon of the black hole ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "only the nonlinearity corresponding solely to the classical einstein - maxwell theory is left as the outcome of the gravitational collapse process .",
    "the same effective potential technique ( see @xcite ) , which allowed the analysis of circular orbits around the black hole , was crucial in reaching the equally interesting discovery of the reversible and irreversible transformations of black holes by @xcite , which in turn led to the mass - energy formula of the black hole : @xmath20 with @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the horizon surface area , @xmath23 is the irreducible mass , @xmath24 is the horizon radius and @xmath25 is the quasi - spheroidal cylindrical coordinate of the horizon evaluated at the equatorial plane .",
    "extreme black holes satisfy the equality in eq.([s1 ] ) .    from eq.([em ] ) follows that the total energy of the black hole @xmath26 can be split into three different parts : rest mass , coulomb energy and rotational energy . in principle both coulomb energy and rotational energy can be extracted from the black hole ( @xcite ) .",
    "the maximum extractable rotational energy is 29% and the maximum extractable coulomb energy is 50% of the total energy , as clearly follows from the upper limit for the existence of a black hole , given by eq.([s1 ] ) .",
    "we refer in the following to both these extractable energies as the blackholic energy .    the existence of the black hole and the basic correctness of the circular orbit binding energies has been proven by the observations of cygnus - x1 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned in binary x - ray sources , the black hole uniquely acts passively by generating the deep potential well in which the accretion process occurs .",
    "it has become tantalizing to look for astrophysical objects in order to verify the other fundamental prediction of general relativity that the blackholic energy is the largest energy extractable from any physical object .",
    "we also recall that the feasibility of the blackholic energy extraction has been made possible by the quantum processes of creating , out of classical fields , a plasma of electron - positron pairs in the field of black holes . @xcite",
    "clearly evidenced that a static electromagnetic field stronger than the critical value : @xmath27 can polarize the vacuum and create electron - positron pairs . as we illustrate in the next sections ,",
    "the major effort in verifying the correctness of this theoretical prediction has been directed in the analysis of heavy ion collisions ( see @xcite and references therein ) . from an order - of - magnitude estimate , it would appear that around a nucleus with a charge : @xmath28 the electric field can be as strong as the electric field polarizing the vacuum . as we show in the next sections",
    ", a more accurate detailed analysis taking into account the bound states levels around a nucleus brings to a value of @xmath29 for the nuclear charge leading to the existence of a critical field . from the heisenberg uncertainty principle it follows that",
    ", in order to create a pair , the existence of the critical field should last a time @xmath30 which is much longer then the typical confinement time in heavy ion collisions which is @xmath31 this is certainly a reason why no evidence for pair creation in heavy ion collisions has been obtained although remarkable effort has been spent in various accelerators worldwide .",
    "similar experiments involving laser beams meet with analogous difficulties ( see e.g. @xcite and next sections ) .    in 1975",
    "@xcite advanced the alternative idea that the critical field condition given in eq.([ec ] ) could be easily reached , and for a time much larger than the one given by eq.([dt ] ) , in the field of a kerr - newman black hole in a range of masses @xmath32 . in that paper there was generalized to the curved kerr - newman geometry the fundamental theoretical framework developed in minkowski space by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this result was made possible by the work on the structure of the kerr - newman spacetime previously done by @xcite and by the remarkable mathematical craftsmanship of thibault damour then working with one of us ( rr ) as a post - doc in princeton .",
    "we give on this topic some additional details in the next sections .",
    "the maximum energy extractable in such a process of creating a vast amount of electron - positron pairs around a black hole is given by : @xmath33 we concluded in that paper that such a process `` naturally leads to a most simple model for the explanation of the recently discovered @xmath0-rays bursts '' .    at that time , grbs had not yet been optically identified and nothing was known about their distance and consequently about their energetics .",
    "literally thousands of theories existed in order to explain them and it was impossible to establish a rational dialogue with such an enormous number of alternative theories ( see @xcite ) .",
    "as we will see , this situation was drastically modified by the observations of bepposax .",
    "the mystery of grbs became deeper as the observations of the batse instrument on board of the compton gamma - ray observatory ( cgro ) satellite over @xmath34 years proved the isotropy of these sources in the sky ( see fig .",
    "[ batse2k ] ) .",
    "in addition to these data , the cgro satellite gave an unprecedented number of details on the grb structure , on their spectral properties and time variabilities which have been collected in the fourth batse catalog ( @xcite , see e.g. fig .",
    "[ grb_profiles_eng ] ) .",
    "analyzing these batse sources it soon became clear ( see e.g. @xcite ) the existence of two distinct families of sources : the long bursts , lasting more then one second and softer in spectra , and the short bursts ( see fig . [ slb ] ) , harder in spectra ( see fig . [ tavani ] ) .",
    "we shall return shortly on this topic .",
    "s ) and long ( @xmath35 s ) grbs are represented . reproduced , by his kind permission , from @xcite where the details are given . ]",
    "the situation drastically changed with the discovery of the afterglow by the italian - dutch satellite bepposax ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a discovery led to the optical identification of the grbs by the largest telescopes in the world , including the hubble space telescope , the keck telescope in hawaii and the vlt in chile , and allowed as well the identification in the radio band of these sources .",
    "the outcome of this collaboration between complementary observational technique made possible in 1997 the identification of the distance of these sources from the earth and of their tremendous energy of the order up to @xmath36 erg / second during the burst , which indeed coincides with the theoretical prediction made by @xcite given in eq ..    the resonance between the x- and gamma ray astronomy from the satellites and the optical and radio astronomy from the ground , had already marked the great success and development of the astrophysics of binary x - ray sources in the seventies ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this resonance is re - proposed here for grbs on a much larger scale .",
    "the use of much larger satellites , like chandra and xmm - newton , and specific space missions , like hete - ii and _ swift _ , together with the very lucky circumstance of the coming of age of the development of optical technologies for the telescopes , such as keck in hawaii and vlt in chile , offers today opportunities without precedence in the history of mankind .",
    "turning now to the theoretical progresses , it is interesting that the idea of using an electron - positron plasma as a basis of a grb model , introduced in @xcite , was independently considered years later in a set of papers by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "however , these authors did not address the issue of the physical origin of their energy source .",
    "they reach their conclusions considering the pair creation and annihilation process occurring in the confinement of a large amount of energy in a region of dimension @xmath37 km typical of a neutron star .",
    "no relation to the physics of black holes nor to the energy extraction process from a black hole was envisaged in their interesting considerations , mainly directed to the study of the creation and consequent evolution of such an electron - positron plasma .",
    "after the discovery of the afterglows and the optical identification of grbs at cosmological distances , implying exactly the energetics predicted in eq.([emax ] ) , we returned to the analysis of the vacuum polarization process around a black hole and precisely identified the region around the black hole in which the vacuum polarization process and the consequent creation of electron - positron pairs occur .",
    "we defined this region , using the greek name for pairs ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) , to be the `` dyadosphere '' of the black hole , bounded by the black hole horizon and the dyadosphere radius @xmath40 given by ( see @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath41 where we have introduced the dimensionless mass and charge parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 .",
    "the total energy of the electron positron pairs , @xmath44 is equal to the dyadosphere energy @xmath3 .    our grb model , like all prevailing models in the existing literature ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) ,",
    "is based on the acceleration of an optically thick electron - positron plasma .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the origin and the energetics of such a plasma , either in relation to black hole physics or to other physical processes , has often been discussed qualitatively in the grb scientific literature but never quantitatively with explicit equations .",
    "the concept of the dyadosphere ( @xcite ) is the only attempt , as far as we know , to do this .",
    "it relates such an electron - positron plasma to black hole physics and to the features of the grb progenitor star , using explicit equations that satisfy the existing physical laws ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein , see also @xcite ) .",
    "this step is essential if one wishes to identify the physical origin and energetics of grbs .",
    "all the successive evolution of the electron - positron plasma are independent on this step and are indeed common to all prevailing grb models in the literature .",
    "of course , great differences still exists between the actual treatments of this evolution in the current literature , as we show in the next sections .",
    "analogies exist between the concept of dyadosphere and the work of @xcite , as well as marked conceptual differences . in the dyadosphere",
    "the created electron - positron pairs are assumed to reach thermal equilibrium and have an essential role in the dynamical acceleration process of grbs . in @xcite",
    "it is assumed that the created electron - positron pairs do annihilate in a cascade process in a very short bremmsstrahlung time scale : they can not participate in any way to the dynamical phases of the grb process .",
    "it is interesting that these differences can be checked both theoretically and observationally .",
    "it should be possible , in the near future , to evaluate all the cross sections involved by the above annihilation processes and assess by a direct explicit analysis which one of the two above approaches is the correct one .",
    "on the other side , such two approaches certainly lead to very different predictions for the grb structure , especially for the short ones .",
    "these predictions will certainly be compared to observations in the near future .",
    "we have already emphasized that the study of grbs is very likely `` the '' most extensive computational and theoretical investigation ever done in physics and astrophysics .",
    "there are at least three different fields of research which underlie the foundation of the theoretical understanding of grbs .",
    "all three , for different reasons , are very difficult .",
    "the first field of research is special relativity .",
    "as one of us ( rr ) always mention to his students in the course of theoretical physics , this field is paradoxically very difficult since it is extremely simple . in approaching special relativistic phenomena",
    "the extremely simple and clear procedures expressed by einstein in his 1905 classic paper @xcite are often ignored .",
    "einstein makes use in his work of very few physical assumptions , an almost elementary mathematical framework and gives constant attention to a proper operational definition of all observable quantities .",
    "those who work on grbs use at times very intricate , complex and often wrong theoretical approaches lacking the necessary self - consistency .",
    "this is well demonstrated in the current literature on grbs .    the second field of research essential for understanding the energetics of grbs deals with quantum electrodynamics and the relativistic process of pair creation in overcritical electromagnetic fields as well as in very high density photon gas .",
    "this topic is also very difficult but for a quite different conceptual reason : the process of pair creation , expressed in the classic works of heisenberg - euler - schwinger @xcite later developed by many others , is based on a very powerful theoretical framework but has not yet been verified by experimental data .",
    "similarly , the creation of electron - positron pairs from high density and high energy photons lacks still today the needed theoretical description .",
    "as we will show in the next sections , there is the tantalizing possibility of observing these phenomena , for the first time , in the astrophysical setting of grbs on a more grandiose scale .",
    "there is a third field which is essential for the understanding of the grb phenomenon : general relativity . in this case , contrary to the case of special relativity , the field is indeed very difficult , since it is very difficult both from a conceptual , technical and mathematical point of view .",
    "the physical assumptions are indeed complex .",
    "the entire concept of geometrization of physics needs a new conceptual approach to the field .",
    "the mathematical complexity of the pseudo - riemannian geometry contrasts now with the simple structure of the pseudo - euclidean minkowski space .",
    "the operational definition of the observable quantities has to take into account the intrinsic geometrical properties and also the cosmological settings of the source .",
    "with grbs we have the possibility to follow , from a safe position in an asymptotically flat space at large distance , the formation of a black hole horizon with all the associated relativistic phenomena of light bending and time dilatation .",
    "most important , as we will show in details in the next sections , general relativity in connection with quantum phenomena offers , with the blackholic energy , the explanation of the tremendous grb energy sources and the possibility to follow in great details the black hole formation .    for these reasons grbs offer an authentic new frontier in the field of physics and astrophysics .",
    "we recall that in the special relativity field , for the first time , we observe phenomena occurring at lorentz gamma factors of approximately @xmath45 . in the field of relativistic quantum electro - dynamics we see for the first time the interchange between classical fields and high density photon fields with the created quantum matter - antimatter pairs . in the field of general relativity also for the first time we can test the blackholic energy which is the basic energetic physical variable underlying the entire grb phenomenon .",
    "the most appealing aspect of this work is that , if indeed these three different fields are treated and approached with the necessary technical and scientific maturity , the model which results has a very large redundancy built - in .",
    "the approach requires an unprecedented level of self - consistency .",
    "any departures from the correct theoretical treatment in this very complex system lead to exponential departures from the correct solution and from the correct fit of the observations .",
    "it is so that , as the model is being properly developed and verified , its solution will have existence and uniqueness . in order to build a theoretical grb model ,",
    "we have found necessary to establish clear guidelines by introducing three basic paradigms for the interpretation of grbs .",
    "the ongoing dialogue between our work and the one of the workers on grbs , rests still on some elementary considerations presented by einstein in his classic article of 1905 @xcite .",
    "these considerations are quite general and even precede einstein s derivation , out of first principles , of the lorentz transformations .",
    "we recall here einstein s words : `` we might , of course , content ourselves with time values determined by an observer stationed together with the watch at the origin of the co - ordinates , and co - ordinating the corresponding positions of the hands with light signals , given out by every event to be timed , and reaching him through empty space . but",
    "this co - ordination has the disadvantage that it is not independent of the standpoint of the observer with the watch or clock , as we know from experience '' .     and the laboratory time @xmath46 .",
    "details in @xcite . ]",
    "the message by einstein is simply illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ttasch_new_bn ] .",
    "if we consider in an inertial frame a source ( solid line ) moving with high speed and emitting light signals ( dashed lines ) along the direction of its motion , a far away observer will measure a delay @xmath47 between the arrival time of two signals respectively emitted at the origin and after a time interval @xmath48 in the laboratory frame , which in our case is the frame where the black hole is at rest .",
    "the real velocity of the source is given by : @xmath49 and the apparent velocity is given by : @xmath50 as pointed out by einstein the adoption of coordinating light signals simply by their arrival time as in eq.([vapp ] ) , without an adequate definition of synchronization , is incorrect and leads to unsurmountable difficulties as well as to apparently `` superluminal '' velocities as soon as motions close to the speed of light are considered .",
    "the use of @xmath47 as a time coordinate , often tacitly adopted by astronomers , should be done , if at all , with proper care .",
    "the relation between @xmath47 and the correct time parameterization in the laboratory frame has to be taken into account : @xmath51 in other words , the relation between the arrival time and the laboratory time can not be done without a knowledge of the speed along the _ entire _ world - line of the source . in the case of grbs ,",
    "such a worldline starts at the moment of gravitational collapse .",
    "it is of course clear that the parameterization in the laboratory frame has to take into account the cosmological redshift @xmath52 of the source .",
    "we then have , at the detector : @xmath53    in the current grb literature , eq.([tadef ] ) has been systematically neglected by addressing only the afterglow description neglecting the previous history of the source .",
    "often the integral equation has been approximated by a clearly incorrect instantaneous value : @xmath54 the attitude has been adopted to consider separately the afterglow part of the grb phenomenon , without the knowledge of the entire equation of motion of the source .",
    "this point of view has reached its most extreme expression in the works reviewed by @xcite , where the so - called `` prompt radiation '' , lasting on the order of @xmath55 s , is considered as a burst emitted by the prolonged activity of an `` inner engine '' . in these models , generally referred to as the `` internal shock model '' , the emission of the afterglow is assumed to follow the `` prompt radiation '' phase ( @xcite ) .    as we outline in the following sections , such an extreme point of view originates from the inability of obtaining the time scale of the `` prompt radiation '' from a burst structure .",
    "these authors consequently appeal to the existence of an `` ad hoc '' inner engine in the grb source to solve this problem .",
    "we show in the following sections how this difficulty has been overcome in our approach by interpreting the `` prompt radiation '' as an integral part of the afterglow and _ not _ as a burst .",
    "this explanation can be reached only through a relativistically correct theoretical description of the entire afterglow ( see next sections ) . within the framework of special relativity",
    "we show that it is not possible to describe a grb phenomenon by disregarding the knowledge of the entire past worldline of the source .",
    "we show that at @xmath55 seconds the emission occurs from a region of dimensions of approximately @xmath56 cm , well within the region of activity of the afterglow .",
    "this point was not appreciated in the current literature due to the neglect of the apparent superluminal effects implied by the use of the `` pathological '' parametrization of the grb phenomenon by the arrival time of light signals .",
    "we can now turn to the first paradigm , the relative space - time transformation ( rstt ) paradigm ( @xcite ) which emphasizes the importance of a global analysis of the grb phenomenon encompassing both the optically thick and the afterglow phases .",
    "since all the data are received in the detector arrival time it is essential to know the equations of motion of all relativistic phases with @xmath57 of the grb sources in order to reconstruct the time coordinate in the laboratory frame , see eq .. contrary to other phenomena in nonrelativistic physics or astrophysics , where every phase can be examined separately from the others , in the case of grbs all the phases are inter - related by their signals received in arrival time @xmath58 .",
    "there is the need , in order to describe the physics of the source , to derive the laboratory time @xmath46 as a function of the arrival time @xmath58 along the entire past worldline of the source using eq",
    "..    an additional difference , also linked to special relativity , between our treatment and the ones in the current literature relates to the assumption of the existence of scaling laws in the afterglow phase : the power law dependence of the lorentz gamma factor on the radial coordinate is usually systematically assumed . from the proper use of the relativistic transformations and by the direct numerical and analytic integration of the special relativistic equations of motion we demonstrate",
    "( see next sections ) that no simple power - law relation can be derived for the equations of motion of the system .",
    "this situation is not new for workers in relativistic theories : scaling laws exist in the extreme ultrarelativistic regimes and in the newtonian ones but not in the intermediate fully relativistic regimes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "we turn now to the second paradigm , which is more complex since it deals with all the different phases of the grb phenomenon .",
    "we first address the dynamical phases following the dyadosphere formation .",
    "after the vacuum polarization process around a black hole , one of the topics of the greatest scientific interest is the analysis of the dynamics of the electron - positron plasma formed in the dyadosphere .",
    "this issue was addressed by us in a collaboration with jim wilson at livermore .",
    "the numerical simulations of this problem were developed at livermore , while the semi - analytic approach was developed in rome ( see @xcite and next sections ) .",
    "the corresponding treatment in the framework of the cavallo , rees et al .",
    "analysis was performed by @xcite also using a numerical approach , by @xcite using an analytic approach and by @xcite using a numerical and semi - analytic approach .",
    "although some analogies exists between these treatments , they are significantly different in the theoretical details and in the final results ( see @xcite and next sections ) .",
    "since the final result of the grb model is extremely sensitive to any departure from the correct treatment , it is indeed very important to detect at every step the appearance of possible fatal errors .",
    "a conclusion common to all these treatments is that the electron - positron plasma is initially optically thick and expands till transparency reaching very high values of the lorentz gamma factor .",
    "a second point , which is common , is the discovery of a new clear feature : the plasma shell expands but the lorentz contraction is such that its width in the laboratory frame appears to be constant .",
    "this self acceleration of the thin shell is the distinguishing factor of grbs , conceptually very different from the physics of a fireball developed by the inner pressure of an atomic bomb explosion in the earth s atmosphere . in the case of grbs",
    "the region interior to the shell is inert and with pressure totally negligible : the entire dynamics occurs on the shell itself .",
    "for this reason , we refer in the following to the self accelerating shell as the `` fireshell '' .",
    "there is a major difference between our approach and the ones of piran , mszros and rees , in that the dyadosphere is assumed by us to be initially filled uniquely with an electron - positron plasma .",
    "such a plasma expands in substantial agreement with the results presented in the work of @xcite . in our model",
    "the fireshell of electron - positron pairs and photons ( pem pulse , see @xcite ) evolves and encounters the remnant of the star progenitor of the newly formed black hole .",
    "the fireshell is then loaded with baryons .",
    "a new fireshell is formed of electron - positron - photons and baryons ( pemb pulse , see @xcite ) which expands all the way until transparency is reached . at transparency",
    "the emitted photons give origin to what we define as the proper - grb ( p - grb , see @xcite and fig .",
    "[ cip2 ] ) .",
    "which has been computed following the prescriptions of eq .. details in @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ] +   which has been computed following the prescriptions of eq .. details in @xcite.,title=\"fig : \" ]    in our approach , the baryon loading is measured by a dimensionless quantity @xmath59 which gives direct information about the mass @xmath60 of the remnant , where @xmath61 is the proton mass .",
    "the corresponding treatment done by piran and collaborators ( @xcite ) and by @xcite differs in one important respect : the baryonic loading is assumed to occur since the beginning of the electron - positron pair formation and no relation to the mass of the remnant of the collapsed progenitor star is attributed to it .",
    "a further difference also exists between our description of the rate equation for the electron - positron pairs and the ones by those authors . while our results are comparable with the ones obtained by piran under the same initial conditions , the set of approximations adopted by @xcite appears to be too radical and leads to different results violating energy and momentum conservation",
    "( see next sections and @xcite ) .    from our analysis ( @xcite )",
    "it also becomes clear that such expanding dynamical evolution can only occur for values of @xmath62 .",

    "while in the case of a neutron star collapse a very large amount of matter is expelled , in many instances well above the mass of the neutron star itself , in the case of black holes leading to a grb only a very small fraction of the initial mass ( @xmath64 or less ) is expelled .",

    "we recall , as well , the simulation of different geometries assumed for the fireshell and the essential role of the livermore code in selecting the correct one among these different possibilities for the dynamics of this plasma composed uniquely of electron , positron and photons ( pem pulse ) . the correct solution resulted to be a very special one : the fireshell is expanding in its comoving frame but its thickness is kept constant in the laboratory frame due to the balancing effect of the lorentz contraction .",
    "we then examine the equations for the engulfment of the baryon loading as well as the further expansion of the fireshell composed by electron , positron , photons and baryon ( pemb pulse ) up to the transparency point .",

    "this connection to the optically thick era is missing in the current approach in the literature which attributes the origin of the `` prompt radiation '' to an unspecified inner engine activity ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the initial conditions at the beginning of the afterglow era are obtained by a best fit of the later parts of the afterglow .",
    "this approach is quite unsatisfactory since , as we will explicitly show in the next sections , the theoretical treatments currently adopted in the description of the afterglow are not appropriate .",
    "the fit which uses an inappropriate theoretical treatment leads necessarily to the wrong conclusions as well as , in turn , to the determination of incorrect initial conditions .",
    "the order of magnitude estimate usually quoted for the characteristic time scale to be expected for a burst emitted by a grb at the moment of transparency at the end of the optically thick expansion phase is given by @xmath74 .",
    "for a @xmath75 black hole this will give @xmath76 s. there are reasons today not to take seriously such an order of magnitude estimate ( see next sections and e.g. @xcite ) . in any case",

    "this explanation has always appeared logically inconsistent since there remain to be explained not one but two very different mechanisms , independent of each other , of similar and extremely large energetics .",
    "this approach has generated an additional very negative result : it has distracted everybody working in the field from the earlier very interesting work on the optically thick phase of grbs .",
    "the way out of this dichotomy in our model is drastically different : * 1 ) * indeed the optically thick phase exists , is crucial to the grb phenomenon and terminates with a burst : the p - grb ; * 2 ) * the `` prompt radiation '' follows the p - grb ; * 3 ) * the `` prompt radiation '' is not a burst : it is actually the temporally extended peak emission of the afterglow ( e - ape ) .",
    "the observed structures of the prompt radiation can all be traced back to inhomogeneities in the interstellar medium ( see fig .",

    "in particular , on the ground of the theoretical considerations by @xcite , it was conjectured that , within the framework of a conical jet model , one may find that the gamma - ray energy released in all grbs is narrowly clustered around @xmath85 ergs ( @xcite ) .",

    "exist in the literature two extreme points of view : the one by fenimore and collaborators ( see e.g. @xcite ) and piran and collaborators ( see e.g. @xcite ) on one side and the one by dermer and collaborators ( @xcite ) on the other .",
    "fenimore and collaborators have emphasized the relevance of a specific signature to be expected in the collision of a relativistic expanding shell with the ism , what they call a fast rise and exponential decay ( fred ) shape .",
    "this feature is confirmed by our analysis ( see peaks a , b , c in fig .  [ substr_peak ] ) .",

    "the solution of the short time variability has to be envisioned within the protracted activity of an unspecified `` inner engine '' ( @xcite ) ; see as well @xcite . on the other hand , dermer and collaborators , by considering an idealized process occurring at a fixed @xmath87 , have reached the opposite conclusions and they purport that grb light curves are tomographic images of the density distributions of the medium surrounding the sources of grbs ( @xcite ) . by applying the exact formulas derived in previous sections , we show that dermer s conclusions are correct , and we identify that the `` tomography '' purported by @xcite leads to ism clouds consistently on the order of @xmath88 cm .",
    "apparent superluminal effects are introduced . in our treatment",
    "we have adopted a simple spherically symmetric approximation for the ism distribution .",
    "we show that the agreement of this approximation with the observations is excellent for lorentz gamma factors @xmath89 since the relativistic beaming angle introduced in the previous sections provides an effective cut - off to the visible ism structure . for lower lorentz gamma factors , a three dimensional description of the ism would be needed and the corresponding treatment is currently in preparation .    in section `` the theory of the luminosity in fixed energy bands and spectra of the afterglow '' , having shown in the previous sections a general agreement between the observed luminosity variability and our treatment of the bolometric luminosity , we have further developed the model in order to explain : + * a ) * the details of the observed luminosity in fixed energy bands , which are the ones actually measured by the detectors on the satellites ; + * b ) * the instantaneous as well as the average spectral distribution in the entire afterglow and ; + * c ) * the observed hard to soft drift observed in grb spectra .",
    "+ the fundamental assumption is introduced that the x- and gamma ray radiation during the entire afterglow phase has a thermal spectrum in the co - moving frame .",
    "the ratio @xmath90 between the `` effective emitting area '' @xmath91 of the abm pulse and its full visible area @xmath92 is introduced . due to the ism inhomogeneities , composed of clouds with filamentary structure ,",
    "the abm emitting region is in fact far from being homogeneous .",
    "we have justified the existence of this thermal emission by considering the ism filamentary structure and its optical thickness ( see @xcite ) . the theoretical prediction for the observed",
    "spectra starting from these premises has been by far the most complex and , in our opinion , the most elegant aspect of the entire grb model . in order to compute the luminosity in a fixed energy band at a given value of the arrival time it is necessary to perform a convolution over the given eqts of an infinite number of elementary contributions , each one characterized by a different value of lorentz and doppler factors .",
    "therefore , each observed instantaneous spectrum is theoretically predicted to be the result of a convolution of an infinite number of thermal spectra , each one with a different temperature , over the given eqts and its shape is theoretically predicted to be non - thermal .",
    "moreover , the observed time - integrated spectra depart even more from a thermal shape , being the convolution over the observation time of an infinite number of non - thermal instantaneous spectra .",
    "we confirm in this work the qualitative suggestion advanced by @xcite already in 1999 .",

    "we compare and contrast our theoretically predicted afterglow luminosity in the @xmath93@xmath94 kev band for spherically symmetric versus jetted emission . at these wavelenghts the jetted emission can be excluded and data analysis confirms spherical symmetry .",
    "in fact , the actual afterglow luminosity in fixed energy bands , in spherical symmetry , does not have a simple power law dependence on arrival time .",
    "this circumstance has been erroneously interpreted , in the usual presentation in the literature , as a broken power - law supporting the existence of jet - like structures in grbs .",
    "having used grb 991216 as a prototype , we were constrained by the absence of data in the time range between @xmath95 s and @xmath96 s. this same situation was encountered , even more extremely , in all the other sources , like e.g. grb 970228 , grb 980425 , grb 030329 , etc .",

    "the important point we like to emphasize is that we can get both the luminosity emitted in a fixed energy band and the photon number spectrum starting from the hypothesis that the radiation emitted in the grb process is thermal in the co - moving frame of the expanding pulse .",
    "it has been clearly shown that , after the correct space - time transformations , both the time - resolved and the time - integrated spectra in the observer frame strongly differ from a planckian distribution and have a power - law shape , although they originate from strongly time - varying thermal spectra in the co - moving frame .",
    "we obtain a good agreement of our prediction with the photon number spectrum observed by integral and , in addition , we predict a specific hard - to - soft behavior in the instantaneous spectra . due to the possibility of reaching a precise identification of the emission process in grb afterglows by the observations of the instantaneous spectra",
    ", it is hoped that further missions with larger collecting area and higher time resolving power be conceived and a systematic attention be given to closer - by grb sources . despite this grb",

    "this result , which may appear to be surprising and difficult to explain , is indeed a very natural consequence of the uniqueness theorem of the black hole , graphically expressed since 1971 ( @xcite ) and object of rigorous mathematical proofs in the intervening years ( @xcite ) . with reference to the ism , it is also clear that grbs can only occur in a very finite range of ism density with @xmath946 particle/@xmath947 .",
    "for this reason , while we expect grbs to originating in galactic halos at @xmath948 particles/@xmath947 , we do not expect grbs originating from denser parts of galactic clusters .",
    "the mechanism responsible for the origin and the energetics of the electron - positron plasma originating the grbs , either in relation to black hole physics or to other physical processes , has often been discussed qualitatively in the grb scientific literature but never quantitatively with explicit equations . in our model",
    "it is identified with the quantum vacuum polarization process in the overcritical field developed during the gravitational collapse to a black hole .",
    "the grb energy source is therefore the blackholic energy . in order to mimic this complex dynamical process for mathematical convenience and definiteness of the computations ,",
    "we have first used a dyadosphere around a given and already formed reissner - nordstrm black hole .",
    "this however does not mean that we need a black hole created and staying there forever waiting to be discharged ! the entire process of gravitational collapse we are speaking of lasts less than one second , and the dynamical phases of the existence of the dyadosphere lasts less than @xmath949 s. we are speaking in reality about a very transient phenomenon",
    ". actually grbs are likely the most energetic and transient phenomenon in the universe .    in the same spirit , for mathematical convenience and definiteness ,",
    "we have used some simplified models to probe the dynamical phases of gravitational collapse . the existence of an already overcritical field since the early phases of the gravitational collapse has appeared to be a necessary condition for the creation of an optically thick electron - positron plasma and the extraction of the blackholic energy .",
    "densities on the order of @xmath950@xmath56 g/@xmath947 , namely of @xmath94 times the nuclear density , are necessarily involved in the process of black hole formation from any of the precursors mentioned above . under such conditions ,",
    "the physical description of the process of gravitational collapse needs necessarily to take into account strong , weak , electromagnetic and gravitational interactions , as well as quantum statistics .    in the last section of these lecture notes",
    ", we have exemplified a system which , although globally neutral , presents an internal charge separation due to the concurrence of strong , weak and electromagnetic interactions , as well as of quantum statistics .",
    "what is also very important , this system develops an overcritical electric field .",
    "systems of this kind appear to be a natural initial condition for the gravitational collapse leading to a dyadosphere to occur .",
    "the grbs are , for the first time , probing a variety of new fundamental physics processes :    1 .",
    "the vacuum polarization process and the creation of electron - positron pairs out of the vacuum , which have been for years unsuccessfully attempted in earth - bound experiments , appears to be here at reach for the first time in an astrophysical setting of unprecedented magnitude ; 2 .",
    "the extraction of blackholic energy is possibly to be observed for the first time ; 3 .",
    "the details of gravitational collapse process can be followed with unprecedented accuracy and lead to possible coincident signals in gravitational waves , neutrino bursts and uhecrs .",

    "<S> gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) represent very likely `` the '' most extensive computational , theoretical and observational effort ever carried out successfully in physics and astrophysics . the extensive campaign of observation from space based x - ray and @xmath0-ray observatory , such as the _ vela _ , cgro , bepposax , hete - ii , integral , _ swift _ , r - xte , _ chandra _ </S>",
    "<S> , xmm satellites , have been matched by complementary observations in the radio wavelength ( e.g. by the vla ) and in the optical band ( e.g. by vlt , keck , rosat ) . </S>",
    "<S> the net result is unprecedented accuracy in the received data allowing the determination of the energetics , the time variability and the spectral properties of these grb sources . </S>",
    "<S> the very fortunate situation occurs that these data can be confronted with a mature theoretical development . </S>",
    "<S> theoretical interpretation of the above data allows progress in three different frontiers of knowledge : * a ) * the ultrarelativistic regimes of a macroscopic source moving at lorentz gamma factors up to @xmath1 ; * b ) * the occurrence of vacuum polarization process verifying some of the yet untested regimes of ultrarelativistic quantum field theories ; and * c ) * the first evidence for extracting , during the process of gravitational collapse leading to the formation of a black hole , amounts of energies up to @xmath2 ergs of blackholic energy  a new form of energy in physics and astrophysics . </S>",
    "<S> we outline how this progress leads to the confirmation of three interpretation paradigms for grbs proposed in july 2001 . </S>",
    "<S> thanks mainly to the observations by _ swift _ and the optical observations by vlt , the outcome of this analysis points to the existence of a `` canonical '' grb , originating from a variety of different initial astrophysical scenarios . </S>",
    "<S> the communality of these grbs appears to be that they all are emitted in the process of formation of a black hole with a negligible value of its angular momentum . </S>",
    "<S> the following sequence of events appears to be canonical : the vacuum polarization process in the dyadosphere with the creation of the optically thick self accelerating electron - positron plasma ; the engulfment of baryonic mass during the plasma expansion ; adiabatic expansion of the optically thick `` fireshell '' of electron - positron - baryon plasma up to the transparency ; the interaction of the accelerated baryonic matter with the interstellar medium ( ism ) . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the canonical grb composed of a proper grb ( p - grb ) , emitted at the moment of transparency , followed by an extended afterglow . </S>",
    "<S> the sole parameters in this scenario are the total energy of the dyadosphere @xmath3 , the fireshell baryon loading @xmath4 defined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath5 , and the ism filamentary distribution around the source . in the limit @xmath6 </S>",
    "<S> the total energy is radiated in the p - grb with a vanishing contribution in the afterglow . in this limit , </S>",
    "<S> the canonical grbs explain as well the short grbs . in these lecture notes </S>",
    "<S> we systematically outline the main results of our model comparing and contrasting them with the ones in the current literature . in both cases , </S>",
    "<S> we have limited ourselves to review already published results in refereed publications . </S>",
    "<S> we emphasize as well the role of grbs in testing yet unexplored grounds in the foundations of general relativity and relativistic field theories .    </S>",
