    "understanding electroweak symmetry breaking has been a major goal of the high energy physics community for several decades .",
    "the higgs mechanism  @xcite proposed in 1964 added the higgs boson to the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics ; it has yet to be observed .",
    "direct searches at lep have placed a lower limit of @xmath8  gev/@xmath6  on the sm higgs boson mass ( @xmath9 ) at 95% confidence level ( c.l . ) , while precision electroweak measurements place an indirect limit of @xmath10  gev/@xmath6  at 95% c.l .",
    "figure  [ fig : smhiggsxsecanddecay ] shows the production and decay modes of the sm higgs boson ( @xmath11 ) at the tevatron @xmath12  collider ( @xmath13  tev ) .",
    "the recent observation of single top  @xcite and diboson  @xcite production in semi - leptonic decays have prepared the way for tevatron experiments to probe processes with sub - picobarn cross sections , among which is the sm higgs boson , now a central part of the tevatron program .",
    "we present the status of direct searches for a low mass sm higgs boson using up to @xmath14  of data collected by the cdf  ii and d  detectors  @xcite .",

    "the search for the sm higgs boson is challenging due to the small signal expectation and the large backgrounds .",
    "the search strategy at the tevatron is based on a _ divide and conquer _ approach : since no single signature has sufficient sensitivity , we divide the search into many different channels .",
    "each channel exploits a decay mode using dedicated triggers and analysis techniques .",
    "according to figure  [ fig : smhiggsxsecanddecay ] , @xmath15  is the dominant mode for @xmath16  gev/@xmath6  ( low mass ) while @xmath17  dominates at high mass .",
    "because of the overwhelming irreducible qcd background , it is necessary to seek a striking signature to identify the sm higgs boson . at low mass",
    ", we focus on processes where it is produced in association with a @xmath0 or @xmath1 boson , @xmath18 , while at high mass , the decay products of the @xmath0 allow probing of the five times more likely direct production @xmath19 .",
    "the main low mass channels are dedicated to events with zero ( + @xmath20 )  @xcite , one ( @xmath21@xmath20 )  @xcite or two ( @xmath22@xmath20 )  @xcite identified leptons from the , , and  decay modes .",
    "the background consists of qcd multi - jet production faking the above signatures , the production of a @xmath0 or @xmath1 in association with jets , single top and top pair productions , and diboson production .",
    "these results are combined with the high mass and additional low mass channels to determine the sensitivity of the tevatron experiments to the sm higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "after a cut - based event selection , similar for both experiments and depending on the search channel , most analyses resort to multivariate analysis to reduce the multi - jet background ; @xmath3 quark identification further improves the signal - to - background ratio .",
    "finally , several discriminants  either neural networks ( nn )  @xcite , boosted decision trees ( bdt )  @xcite , or ensembles ( forests ) thereof  @xcite  are trained to maximize the sensitivity .    because the individual analyses use multivariate techniques to exploit the information in each event , it is crucial to check that all the inputs to these techniques , as well as their outputs , are well described by the background models .",
    "we perform these checks comparing the background model to the data in various control regions .",
    "each of these regions is defined to check the modeling of a major background component .",
    "the cdf and d  collaborations have built confidence in detector modeling , and multivariate techniques have been successfully used in recent observations  @xcite .      because @xmath15  is the dominant decay mode for a low mass higgs boson , it is crucial to identify the jets originating from these two @xmath3 quarks .",
    "the cdf analyses  @xcite require that at least one jet in the event be identified as originating from a @xmath3 quark ( tagged ) by the secvtx  @xcite algorithm , which identifies @xmath3 quarks by fitting tracks displaced from the primary vertex .",
    "the second jet in the event can be either    not identified as originating from a @xmath3 quark    tagged by the secvtx  algorithm    tagged by the jetprob  @xcite algorithm , which uses the impact parameter of the tracks to determine the probability that all tracks contained in a jet originate from the primary vertex , and identifies @xmath3 quarks by requiring a low value for that probability    tagged by a neural - network - based tagging algorithm  @xcite that identifies @xmath3 quarks from combined information on displaced vertices , displaced tracks , and low @xmath23 muons    .",
    "the d  analyses  @xcite deploy a bdt algorithm  @xcite designed to discriminate @xmath3 from light ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 ) jets to select events with one or more @xmath3 quark candidates .",
    "the algorithm includes information relating to the lifetime of the hadrons in the jet and results in a discrimination between @xmath3 and light jets .",
    "the analysis samples are divided into two channels , where exactly one ( single tag ) or two ( double tag ) of the leading jets are above a certain value of the bdt output , @xmath28 . in two analyses",
    "@xcite , @xmath28 is also an input to the final discriminant .",
    "physics experiments at hardon colliders heavily rely on a trigger system to select interesting collision events .",
    "dedicated trigger paths meet specific physics goals .",
    "combining multiple paths maximizes acceptance by collecting events that did not fire the dedicated trigger of a given analysis , but which are nonetheless worth investigating .",
    "this combination can be performed either by an _ a priori _ partitioning of the events into orthogonal trigger samples , and checking whether the trigger assigned to the sample fired or not ( cdf @xmath29@xmath20  @xcite ) , or by defining a new path , consisting of a logical or of the trigger paths  @xcite .",
    "the trigger efficiency must , however , be adequately parameterized to accurately account for the effect of the trigger in the monte carlo simulated events . by design , partitioning the events into orthogonal trigger samples requires no additional treatment with respect to the one - trigger approach . in the case of the logical combination , the cdf @xmath30@xmath20  analysis  @xcite models the trigger efficiency with a neural - network based parameterization , which combines 9 ( 14 ) input variables for events with two ( three ) jets ; the d  @xmath29@xmath20  @xcite uses a parameterization based on the lepton @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the jet @xmath23 .",
    "the improvement in modeling the trigger efficiency allows to include more triggers . in the cdf @xmath30@xmath20",
    "analysis , it allows to significantly relax the kinematic cuts , gaining 40% in signal acceptance ( and 7 - 10% in the expected limit ) .",
    "to increase acceptance to leptons , the cdf @xmath33@xmath20  analysis  @xcite deploys a multivariate ( @xmath34 ) lepton identification which uses the lepton @xmath23 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , as well as @xmath37 , the track @xmath38 , impact parameter , isolation , and the number of hits in the silicon detector , which provides a 20% improvement over to a cut - based selection ; the cdf @xmath29@xmath20  analysis includes a new loose electron and isolated track category , included separately , increasing the sensitivity by @xmath39 .      the cdf @xmath33@xmath20  analysis  @xcite plots the discriminant in three regions defined using two @xmath34s to separate the events according to their @xmath40 , light and heavy flavor score . constraining the backgrounds in the first two regions improves the sensitivity by @xmath41 over the case with no separation .",
    "the d  @xmath42@xmath20  and @xmath29@xmath20  analyses  @xcite improve the sensitivity of their discriminant by 5 - 10% by using the output for the bdt tagger as an input to their discriminants .",
    "the d  @xmath30@xmath20  analysis  @xcite reinterprets its data as a search for @xmath43 and @xmath44 production ; it uses a bdt trained using the @xmath45 signal to measure ( consistent with the predicted sm value of @xmath46 pb ) with an expected ( observed ) significance of @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) ( @xmath49 ) . ] .",
    "all the other channels have undergone the same reinterpretation , with the goal to combine the results of these six channels .",
    "figures  [ fig : cdf_lowmasshiggsresults ] and  [ fig : dzero_lowmasshiggsresults ] show the distribution of the final discriminants for double tag events for the six analysis channels .",
    "tables  [ tab : cdf_results ] and  [ tab : dzero_results ] show the expected and observed limits on the @xmath18 production cross section relative to the sm expectation set by each analysis as a function of @xmath50 . for a mass of @xmath5  gev/@xmath6 ,",
    "the best individual channel sets a 95% c.l .",
    "limit of 2.3 times the sm expectation , with all limits below 5@xmath51sm .",
    "the d  collaboration updated the signal cross sections and branching ratios more recent predictions  @xcite , resulting in a loss of @xmath52 in the predicted signal yields  @xcite .",
    "we have presented the latest iterations of the three main low mass searches for a sm higgs boson at cdf and d .",
    "improved analysis techniques have allowed for yet another increase in sensitivity .",
    "a @xmath45 cross - section measurement is performed in each channel to validate the analysis technique of the higgs search .",
    "both collaborations will update these results with the final tevatron dataset .",
