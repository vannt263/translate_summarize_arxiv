    "killed at @xmath2 are studied , with the assumption that @xmath23 is a natural boundary .",
    "the dependence between the initial measure and the yaglom limit is explored in @xcite ( for a brownian motion with constant drift killed at @xmath2 ) and @xcite ( for the orstein - uhlenbeck process killed at @xmath2 ) . in @xcite ,",

    "as explained in the paper , this diffusion is closely related with some markov mortality models .",
    "such applications need the computation of the process qsd , but the tools used in @xcite are based on spectral theory s arguments and do nt allow us to get explicit values .",

    "then the particles evolve independently , until one of them is killed and so on ( see figure [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "one has to prove that the particles do nt degenerate at the boundary . in @xcite ,",
