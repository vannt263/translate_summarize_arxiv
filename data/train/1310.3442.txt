    "in most usual laboratory and/or astrophysical conditions chemical reactions of type @xmath0 are well described by the kinetic approach  @xcite . if @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the concentrations of species @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , the problem is fixed by the relative concentrations @xmath6 suppose some method is given for picking particles of types @xmath3 and @xmath4 while sampling the system . concentrations @xmath7 and @xmath8 are then the relative probabilities of getting particles of the corresponding species at time @xmath9 .",
    "the reaction rates are typically given by the inverse times of free - flight , or velocity/(mean free path ) ratios : if @xmath10 is the average velocity of type-@xmath11 particles , @xmath12 where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the corresponding reaction cross - sections .",
    "the kinetic picture underlying such definitions is well known  @xcite : in eq.([reactionrate11 ] ) , for example , @xmath15 is the effective cylindric volume presented by particle @xmath16 to particle @xmath3 per second .",
    "particle @xmath16 will consequently meet @xmath17 particles @xmath3 per second .",
    "the relative concentrations as functions of time are then described by the master ( or gain / loss ) equations @xmath18 variation in the abundance of species @xmath3 is the abundance of species @xmath4 times the rate of @xmath4-to-@xmath3 transformation ( which represents the gain ) minus the @xmath3 abundance times the rate of its disappearance ( the loss ) .",

    "once equilibrium is attained , the backward reaction is as important as the forward reaction and eq.([eq : reaction ] ) is , of course , better written with a two - sided arrow , @xmath28    the @xmath29 term in the right - hand side of ( [ masternp31 ] ) is present only if @xmath30 . in that case",

    "contact with the usual equilibrium approach @xcite can be made through a few simple considerations . in the equilibrium",
    "classical ( nonrelativisitic , non  quantal ) case , particle @xmath4 ( for example ) will have concentration @xmath45 , where @xmath46 counts the values taken by `` internal '' degrees of freedom ( spin , isospin , etc ) , @xmath47 is the de broglie thermal wavelength of particle @xmath4 ( @xmath48 ) and @xmath49 is its chemical potential .",

    "if we take navely @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , the expected trivial equilibrium requirement follows : @xmath59 .",
    "situation @xmath60 , which must be considered separately , would turn up in the peculiar case @xmath61 : the volume spanned by @xmath62 per unit time , as seen by @xmath4 , equals the volume spanned by @xmath16 per unit time , as seen by @xmath3 .",
    "the solution of eq.([masternp31 ] ) would , in that case , be @xmath63 with , naturally enough , the probabilities tending to equilibrium at @xmath64 .",
    "an example would be an `` elastic '' reaction of type @xmath65 with the same cross - section @xmath66 in both sides .",
    "the crossed reaction @xmath67 would be accounted for by the general case , as @xmath68 , equilibrium being given by the condition @xmath69 .",
    "there are two main approaches to evolving systems .",
    "we have above used the first : time evolution is described by a continuous curve of type @xmath70 , solution of some differential equation . in the second ,",
    "evolution is described by the successive iterations of a mapping  @xcite .",
    "the state is known at each step , as if the `` time '' parameter of the system were defined only at discrete values .",
    "we can go from the first approach to the second by taking the intersections leading to a poincar map .",
    "this approach supposes a characteristic time  the time of a unit step . if a continuous description can be shown to be the interpolation of a discrete mapping  @xcite , a clear notion of characteristic time obtains .",
    "there is , however , a strong requirement : that interpolation must preserve the notion of iteration all along .",
    "this requirement is encapsulated in the so - called semigroup conditions  @xcite . for a function",
    "@xmath71 describing the dynamical flow of a system , these conditions are @xmath72 = f^{<t'>}[f^{<t>}(x ) ] = f^{<t+t'>}(x ) \\ ;   \\ ; ; \\label{i.1 }     \\\\",
    "f^{<0>}(x ) = x \\ ; . \\label{i.2}\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] a sufficient condition for that is that the solution have the form @xmath73   , \\label{contiteratebriggs}\\ ] ] for some function @xmath74 , its inverse @xmath75 and a constant @xmath76 .",
    "this would mean that @xmath74 solves the schrder functional equation @xmath77= c \\ ; f(x).\\ ] ] this can be translated into the additive form @xmath78 = c ' + f(x)$ ] by taking @xmath79 $ ]  what matters is that the semigroup conditions be respected .",
    "let us now notice that the integration constant @xmath32 in ( [ eq : solutionxc ] ) can be obtained by simply taking the inverse function at @xmath80 .",
    "that solution assumes then the form @xmath81\\right\\ } .",
    "\\label{eq : solutionxc2}\\ ] ] this is actually the continuum form of an iterate discrete mapping , and fulfills the semigroup requirement . in more detail : introduce the notations @xmath82 for the composition of functions @xmath83 and @xmath84 , @xmath85 for the @xmath86-th iterate of @xmath83 and @xmath87 for the function inverse to @xmath83 . then , with the functions @xmath88 expression ( [ eq : solutionxc2 ] ) is in effect the continuum version of @xmath89 the quantity @xmath90 is the one - step time in the iteration and indicates the time interval in which the reaction process does make significant progress",
    ".    solution ( [ eq : specialcase ] ) for the special @xmath60 case has already been written in iterative form , with @xmath91 and characteristic time @xmath92 , half the time of free flight .",
    "the assumption used above    that @xmath21 and @xmath22 are constant    actually mean that time @xmath93 is short in comparison with any other `` macroscopic '' time - scale involved .",
    "such a `` macroscopic '' time can , for instance , be the time in which temperature and/or volume of the system change appreciably under the influence of some external agent . for reactions of cosmological interest , as those involved in primordial nucleosynthesis , it is the inverse rate of expansion , or inverse hubble function .",
    "the quantities ( velocities and cross sections ) appearing in eq.([eq : equilibriumx ] ) will depend on such large - scale time .",
    "the first criterion for the validity of the above results is , consequently , that @xmath93 be very short in comparison to those times . in order to use the equilibrium formulae , it would be necessary that equilibrium be attained in not too many steps .",
    "it is usual to take the average time of free flight @xmath94 as an order - of - magnitude indication of the lapse necessary for thermalization to be established .",
    "it gives a rough measure of the time between two `` hits '' in the reaction .",
    "this parameter , however , turns up under conditions quite different from those supposed above  @xcite .",
    "it is conceived for an arrangement by which particles of type @xmath3 impinge with constant velocity @xmath95 upon a medium formed by particles of type @xmath16 with constant number density @xmath96 . with ( constant ) cross section @xmath97 , the mean free path of an @xmath3 particle in the medium will be @xmath98 = @xmath99 , and the corresponding time of free flight , @xmath100 .",
    "the number of unscattered ( that is , keeping the same momentum direction ) particles @xmath3 will then be given by @xmath101 this is a pure - loss equation , quite the same as that for radiative decay .",
    "eventual reproduction of particles @xmath3 with the original momentum by other scatterings is neglected , so that there is no gain .",
    "the solution is , of course , the radiative decay formula @xmath102    this corresponds , up to normalizations , to the special solution ( [ eq : specialcase ] ) .",
    "expression ( [ eq : chartime ] ) , @xmath103 coming from gain - loss considerations , takes also the backward reaction into account and provides , in principle at least , a far better measure of the reaction characteristic time .",
    "a deep discussion of the conditions which are supposed to be satisfied can be found in r. balescu , _ statistical dynamics _ , imperial college press , london , 1997 .",
    "the chemists approach is described in j.e .",
    "leffler and e. grunwald , _ rates and equilibria of organic reactions _ , dover , new york , 1989 , where a very clear exposition is made of the `` cage effect '' and the consequent diffusive regime , which will not be of our concern here .",
