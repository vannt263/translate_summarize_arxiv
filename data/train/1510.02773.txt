    "let @xmath4 be a pl - unknot in @xmath5 with @xmath6 crossings on one of its plane projection .",

    "( see also [ l ] for further results in this direction . ) on the other hand it was proven in [ nw ] that for each @xmath8 and each _ computable _ function @xmath9 there exists a trivial knot @xmath10 triangulated into @xmath6 ( flat ) @xmath11-simplices such that any isotopy between @xmath4 and the trivial unknot that passes through @xmath12-knots must pass through a knot that can not be triangulated into less than @xmath13 simplices .",
    "alternatively , one can consider smooth embeddings of @xmath14 into @xmath15 ( or @xmath16 ) and measure the complexity of knots as their ropelength ( also known as crumpledness - see [ n ] ) that was defined as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the volume of @xmath4 , and @xmath19 denotes the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map for @xmath4 . in other words , @xmath19 is the supremum of all @xmath20 such that any two normals to @xmath4 of length @xmath21 do not intersect . informally speaking , one can think of @xmath19 as the maximal radius of a nonself - intersecting tube centered at @xmath4 .",
    "for this measure of complexity it will still be true that if @xmath22 , then there exists a polynomial upper bound for the complexity of knots in an optimal isotopy connecting an unknot with the standard unknot , and for @xmath23 the worst case complexity of knots in the optimal isotopies grows faster than any computable function .",
    "it is natural to conjecture that the results of [ nw ] for @xmath23 will also hold in the case @xmath24 . here",
    "we will prove that the complexity of untying of a trivial @xmath0-knot can grow faster than a tower of exponentials of any fixed height of the complexity of the unknot .",
    "for each positive @xmath4 and arbitrarily large @xmath6 there exists a trivial @xmath0-knot with complexity @xmath25 in @xmath2 or @xmath26 such that any isotopy between this knot and the standard @xmath0-sphere passes through @xmath0-knots of complexity @xmath27 ( @xmath4 times ) .",
    "( in other words , one needs to increase the complexity more than any tower of exponentials of a fixed height of the initial complexity before the @xmath0-knots can be untied . ) here  complexity \" means either the number of flat @xmath0-simplices in a triangulation of the original pl - knot and each of the intermediate @xmath0-knots ( and in this case intermediate unknots also must be pl ) , or , if the original knot and intermediate knots are smooth , the complexity of a knot can be defined as its ropelength , @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map in the ambient @xmath2 .    in order to prove this theorem we first construct a sequence of finite presentations of @xmath30 .",
    "these finite presentations have certain algebraic properties that help to realize them as  visible \" finite presentations of @xmath0-knots of complexity comparable with the total length of the corresponding finite presentations .",
    "moreover , these finite presentations have the following additional property : in each of them there exists a trivial element of length @xmath11 comparable with the total length of the presentation , @xmath31 , such that one needs to apply the relations at least @xmath32 ( @xmath33 times ) in order to demontrate that this element is , indeed , trivial .",
    "then we prove that the finiteness / effective compactness of the set of trivial @xmath0-knots of bounded complexity ( modulo the group of transformations of @xmath2 generated by dilations and translations ) implies that if all trivial @xmath0-knots could be  untied \" without a very large increase of complexity , then we would be able to contract any null - homotopic closed curve in the complement to the original @xmath0-knot to a point through closed curves that are not much longer than the original one .",
    "but the algebraic property of the finite presentations of @xmath0-knot groups explained in the previous paragraph implies that this is not the case .",
    "recall that the group that has the finite presentation with two generators and one relator @xmath34 is called the baumslag - solitar group .",
    "( here and below we use the standard notation @xmath35 for @xmath36 . )",
    "note that for each @xmath37 @xmath38 , and therefore the commutator @xmath39=e$ ] .",
    "however , one needs to apply the relation @xmath40 times in order to demonstrate this fact in the most obvious way .",
    "in fact , it is well - known that there is no essentially shorter way to write @xmath41 as a product of the conjugates of the relator and its inverse . in other words ,",
    "the dehn function of the baumslag - solitar group is ( at least ) exponential",
    ". a proof of this fact can be found in [ g ] ( and a sketch of another simpler proof using van kampen diagrams can be found in [ s ] ) .",
    "the idea of the proof in the paper of gersten is that the baumslag - solitar group is an hnn - extension and , therefore , the realization complex of the finite presentation will be aspherical .",
    "( recall that the realization complex of a finite presentation has one @xmath42-dimensional cell corresponding to each generator of the group and one @xmath0-cell for each relator of the group . )",
    "so , its universal covering will be contractible , and , in particular , will have the trivial second homology group .",
    "therefore , there will be a unique way to fill each null homologous @xmath42-chain in the universal covering by a @xmath0-chain . each way to represent @xmath41 as the product of conjugates of the relator and its inverse corresponds to a filling of the lift of the loop corresponding to @xmath41 in the realization complex to its universal covering .",
    "therefore , it must have the same number of @xmath0-cells counted with multiplicities as the filling corresponding to the obvious presentation of @xmath41 as a product of conjugates of the relator and its inverse .",
    "it remains only to check that @xmath0-cells in the universal covering that correspond to the obvious representaion of @xmath41 as the product of conjugates of the relator and its inverse do not cancel .",
    "of course , the same proof implies that for each @xmath6 any representation of @xmath43 as a product of conjugates of the relator and its inverse has at least @xmath44 terms .",
    "one can iterate the idea used in the construction of the baumslag - solitar groups and consider the following sequence of finite presentation of groups ( see [ b ] ) . for each @xmath45",
    "@xmath46 this finite presentation has @xmath11 generators and @xmath47 relators of total length @xmath48 .",
    "one can prove that the dehn function of @xmath49 grows as @xmath50 , where the height of the tower of exponentials is @xmath11 , using the approach of [ ger ] ( alternatively , one can use @xmath51-bands ) -see [ b ] . in particular , one can consider @xmath52 defined as @xmath53 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath54 ( @xmath55 times ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath56 will be trivial .",
    "one needs to apply relations more than @xmath57 @xmath58 times to demonstrate that @xmath59 is trivial , when one proceeds in the obvious way . as above",
    ", one can use the asphericity of the representation @xmath0-complex to conclude that the filling in its universal covering is unique on the @xmath0-chain level .",
    "below we will choose @xmath60 `` diagonalizing '' this construction .",
    "again , the same lower bound will hold for any non - zero power of @xmath61 with the same proof .    now conider the following finite presentations @xmath62 , where @xmath63 $ ] are words considered in the previous paragraph .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath64 is the finite presentation of @xmath65 , as @xmath66 in the corresponding gromov group of total length @xmath67 .",
    "the following theorem is the key technical fact in our paper .",
    "it asserts that any way to demonstrate that , say , @xmath68 in @xmath64 would involve at least @xmath69 ( @xmath70 times ) applications of the relations .",
    "equivalently , each representation of @xmath71 as the product of conjugates of the relators and their inverses must involve at least this number of terms .",
    "we are stating and proving this fact using the language of van kampen diagrams ( cf . [ ls ] ) .",
    "each van kampen diagram with the boundary @xmath71 in @xmath64 contains at least @xmath72 ( @xmath70 times ) cells .",
    "consider a minimal van kampen diagram with @xmath71 on the outer boundary .",
    "it must contain cells corresponding to the last relation .",
    "as there are no copies of @xmath73 on the boundary , these cells must form annuli ( @xmath73-annuli ) ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "consider one of the innermost @xmath73-annuli ( that does not have any @xmath73-cells inside ) .",
    "its inner boundary must be a non - zero power of either @xmath61 or @xmath74 .",
    "the second option is impossible , as this would imply that the power of @xmath74 is trivial in @xmath49 , which is false .",
    "so , we have a non - zero power of @xmath61 on the innermost boundary .",
    "the part of the van kampen diagram inside this innermost boundary is a van kampen diagram in @xmath49 .",
    "but we already established that any such diagram must have size of at least @xmath75 ( @xmath70 times ) .    .",
    "@xmath73-annuli are marked by grey . ]",
    "note that if one adds one more relator to the finite presentation @xmath64 , namely , @xmath73 , then one obtains a finite presentation of the trivial group .",
    "denote the resulting finite presentation of the trivial group by @xmath76 .",
    "the finite presentation @xmath76 can be trasformed to the trivial finite presentation of the trivial group by performing @xmath70 elementary operations of the following types : 1 ) replacing a relator by its inverse ; 2 ) replacing a relator by its product with another relator ; and 3 ) replacing a relator @xmath29 by @xmath77 or @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is a generator .",
    "indeed , one can use @xmath70 operations involving only the relators @xmath80 and @xmath73 to replace these two relators by @xmath71 and @xmath73 , and then @xmath81 operations to transform each of the first @xmath47 relators to @xmath51 for an appropriate @xmath82 .",
    "( the trivial finite presentation here is the finite presentation , where the set of relators coincides with the set of generators ) .",
    "note the @xmath76 , the considered trivial finite presentation and all intermediate finite presentations are balanced , that is the number of generators is equal to the number of relators .    for each balanced finite presentation @xmath83 of the trivial group we can construct a smooth @xmath84-manifold in @xmath85 by starting from the connected sum of several copies of @xmath86 , where @xmath87 in each copy of @xmath86 corresponds to one of the generators , and then performing surgeries killing the relators .",
    "more precisely , we realize each relator by a simple closed curve @xmath88 , remove the tubular neighnorhood of @xmath88 , glue in a copy of @xmath89 so that its boundary is glued to the boundary of the removed tubular neighnorhood of @xmath88 , so that the boundary of @xmath90 is glued to a curve isotopic to @xmath88 , and smooth out the boundary . alternatively , we could start from the @xmath0-complex with one @xmath91-cell , @xmath42-cells corresponding to the generators and @xmath0-cells corresponding to relators of @xmath83 ( i.e. the realization complex of @xmath83 ) , embed it into @xmath85 , take the boundary of an open neighborhood of @xmath83 and smooth - out the corners .",
    "the resulting smooth @xmath84-manifold will have the fundamental group with the obvious finite presentation @xmath83 ( in particular , it will be isomorphic to the trivial group ) , and the trivial second homology group .",
    "so , it will be a homotopy @xmath84-sphere .",
    "denote it by @xmath92 .",
    "but it is easy to see that @xmath92 will be diffeomorphic to @xmath26 .",
    "the reason is that if two balanced finite presentations @xmath83 and @xmath93 are related by one elementary operation of any of the three types introduced in the previous paragraph , the manifolds @xmath92 and @xmath94 are diffeomorphic via a diffeomorphism that can be described as a ",
    "handle slide \" .",
    "each elementary operation with finite presentation corresponds to an isotopy of a curve bounding a @xmath0-disc forming an axis of a @xmath0-handle .",
    "the isotopy of the boundary of a @xmath0-disc can be extended to an isotopy of the @xmath0-disc , the whole @xmath0-handle and the whole @xmath84-manifold .",
    "after finitely many operations we will end up with the @xmath84-manifold @xmath95 constructed from a finite presentation @xmath96 with the same generator as @xmath76 and relators killing all the generators , which is diffeomorphic to the standard @xmath26 by means of an obvious diffeomorphism .",
    "thus , each handle slide as well as the whole sequence of handle slides used to constract diffeomorphisms between @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be regarded as an isotopy @xmath99,\\ m^4_0(q_n)=m^4(q_n),\\ m^4_1(q_n)=m^4(t_n)$ ] .",
    "this isotopy can then be extended to an obious isotopy between @xmath97 and the round sphere @xmath26 of radius one .    before moving further we are going to give the following definition :    let @xmath9 and @xmath79 be two positive valued functions defined on a closed unbounded subset @xmath100 of @xmath101 .",
    "we say that they have _ similar growth _ if there exist @xmath102 such that @xmath103 ( @xmath102 exponentiations both in the argument of @xmath79 and of the value of @xmath79 ) and @xmath104 ( @xmath102 exponentiations both of @xmath20 and @xmath9 ) .",
    "@xmath105 here means @xmath106 .",
    "increasing functions that do _ not _ have similar growth with @xmath107 ( restricted to their domain ) are called _ rapidly growing _ functions .",
    "an increasing function that is not rapidly growing is called _ reasonably growing_.    now note that our explanation of why @xmath108 is diffeomorphic to @xmath26 can be used to construct an explicit diffeomorphism such that its lipschitz constant regarded as a function of @xmath11 is bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "next consider the last relator , @xmath73 , and represent it by a simple curve in @xmath108 that we will also denote @xmath73 .",
    "it corresponds to a @xmath0-handle @xmath109 in @xmath108 .",
    "the @xmath0-disc @xmath100 filling @xmath73 forms a generator of this handle , which is diffeomorphic to @xmath110 .",
    "consider the @xmath0-sphere @xmath111 , where @xmath112 is a point inside @xmath100 .",
    "we claim that the fundamental group of the complement @xmath113 is isomorphic to @xmath30 , and , in fact , it is that this group has  apparent \" finite presentation @xmath64 .",
    "indeed , @xmath113 can be deformed to @xmath114 minus a tubular neighborhood of @xmath73 .",
    "yet the deleted tubular neighborhood of @xmath73 decomposes into a @xmath115-cell and a @xmath84-cell .",
    "therefore , if one attaches the deleted tubular neighborhood back then the  apparent \" finite presentation of the fundamental group remains unchanged .",
    "thus , @xmath64 is an  apparent \" finite presentation of @xmath113 .",
    "the meaning of `` apparent '' finite presentation here is that each loop in @xmath113 can be homotoped to a bouquet of loops representing the generators of @xmath64 with an insignificant length increase .",
    "( here and below a length increase is regarded as insignificant if it is measured by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 . )",
    "consider a @xmath0-knot @xmath116 in @xmath108 . now consider a diffeomorphism between @xmath108 and @xmath95 that can be obtained as a sequence of handle slides corresponding to elementary operations transforming @xmath64 into @xmath96 .",
    "take the composition of this diffeomorphism with a diffeomorphism between @xmath95 and the standard round sphere @xmath26 .",
    "denote the resulting diffeomorphism between @xmath114 and the round @xmath26 by @xmath117 .",
    "note that it is easy ensure that the lipschitz constants of @xmath117 and its inverse were bounded by reasonably growing functions of @xmath11 .",
    "indeed , it is sufficient to verify that this will hold for diffeomorphisms corresponding to the individual handle slides .",
    "now each handle slide can be regarded as an isotopy extension that extends an isotopy of a simple curve bounding a @xmath0-disc forming an axis of a @xmath0-handle .",
    "one can discretize this isotopy of closed curve into small isotopes where the closed curves at the beginning and the end of the isotopy are normal variations of each other inside tubes of radius bounded by the injectivity radii of the normal exponential map of the curves .",
    "further , one can ensure that the inverses of these injectivity radii of closed curves during the handle slide isotopies are uniformly bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "now it is obvious that lipschitz constant of diffeomorphisms corresponding to the individual steps of the discretized isotopy are bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "now , it remains to check that the number of small steps in the discretization is also bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 . in other words , the isotopies do not need to be too long . in order to see this",
    "we can just analyze the isotopies corresponding to each of the elementary operations .",
    "( alternatively , one can use an argument that provides an explicit upper bound for the number of points in a minimal @xmath118-net in the space of lipschitz curves of bounded length with injectivity radius of the normal exponential map bounded below by a positive parameter . )",
    "the desired family of @xmath0-knots are @xmath119 in the standard round @xmath26 .",
    "one can also perform a stereographic projection from a point on @xmath26 far from @xmath119 and obtain desired @xmath0-knots in @xmath2 .",
    "now we are going to use a concept from [ gro ] : for each riemannian manifold , or , more generally , length space @xmath120 if finite diameter we define its _ filling length _",
    "function @xmath121 as follows . for each positive @xmath20",
    "let @xmath122 denote the set of all contractible closed curves on @xmath120 that have length @xmath21 .",
    "for each @xmath123 let @xmath124 be the set of all homotopies contracting @xmath88 to a point .",
    "we consider elements of @xmath124 as one - parametric families of closed curves starting at @xmath88 and ending at a point .",
    "for each @xmath125 let @xmath126 denotes the maximal length of a closed curve in @xmath127 . then define @xmath128 as the @xmath129 .",
    "finally , we define _ filling _ @xmath130 of @xmath120 as the supremum of @xmath131 over all closed _ contractible _",
    "curves @xmath88 .",
    "in order for this supremum to be finite it is helpful if all sufficiently short closed curves can be contracted to a point without length increase as it happens , for example , for riemannian manifolds .",
    "further , note that if @xmath120 is , in addition , simply connected , then @xmath132 can be majorized in terms of the value @xmath133 of this supremum on curves of length @xmath134 .",
    "the choice of @xmath135 here is due to the well - known fact ( [ gr ] ) that each closed curve @xmath88 in a riemannian manifold ( possibly with boundary ) @xmath120 can be homotoped with almost no increase of length to a join of closed curves of length @xmath134 and contracted through closed curves of length @xmath136 length@xmath137 const@xmath138 .",
    "indeed , one can choose any point @xmath139 , a finite set of points @xmath140 on @xmath88 such that @xmath51 and @xmath141 are close to each other , and to reduce contracting @xmath88 to contracting geodesic triangles @xmath142 .",
    "we see that if @xmath120 is simply - connected , then the length of @xmath88 will increase by at most @xmath143 for the described contracting homotopy , and then one can pass to the limit as @xmath144 .    in this paper",
    "we are going to apply this concept to spaces that are not simply connected , but have fundamental groups isomorphic to @xmath30 .",
    "these spaces will be complements to trivial @xmath0-knots , and it is easy to see that the generators of @xmath30 can be represented by based loops of length that does not exceed twice the diameter of these spaces plus an arbitrarily small @xmath118 .",
    "indeed , one can take a very small circle around the embedded @xmath145 and connect it with the base point by two minimizing geodesics travelled in the opposite directions .",
    "denote the resulting curve by @xmath146 .",
    "now proceed as in the simply connected case with the only difference that distances between points @xmath51 and @xmath141 on @xmath88 in the metric of @xmath88 are now chosen as @xmath147 rather than a very small @xmath118 . in this way we control the number of the triangles @xmath142 in terms of @xmath148 .",
    "each of these triangles has length @xmath149 and is homotopic to a point or @xmath146 which",
    "is possibly iterated several times and maybe also travelled in the opposite direction .",
    "once we homotope @xmath88 into a collection of integer iterates of @xmath146 ( where the exponents must sum to zero ) , we will be able to cancel them and contract the resulting curve without increasing its length .",
    "therefore , in order to prove the finiteness of @xmath132 it is sufficient to demonstrate the existence of the supremum of the maximal length of loops in an  optimal \" homotopy contracting a loop of length @xmath150 to an integer power of @xmath146 .",
    "( here the supremum is taken over all loops of length @xmath150 ; the word  optimal \" means that we are taking the infimum over all such homotopies ; the power of @xmath146 is uniquely determined by the initial curve and is locally constant ) .",
    "the existence of this supremum becomes evident when we combine the following two facts : first , note that the ascoli - arzela theorem implies the compactness of the set of closed curves in @xmath120 of bounded length parametrized proportionally to the arclength .",
    "second , assume the existence of @xmath151 such that each closed loop of length @xmath152 can be contracted to a point without length increase .",
    "how let @xmath153 , @xmath153 be two loops such that for each @xmath73 @xmath154 .",
    "then @xmath153 , @xmath155 will be homotopic to the same power of @xmath146 , and given a homotopy between @xmath153 and this power of @xmath146 , we can extend it to a homotopy for @xmath155 by merely adding a homotopy between @xmath155 and @xmath153 that does not increase length by much .",
    "this implies the second fact that the maximal length of loops in an  optimal \" isotopy can not significantly increase under ( controllably ) small perturbations of loops .",
    "now we plan to use these filling functions similarly to how it had been done in [ n2 ] .",
    "the main idea is that they behave in a similar way to their algebraic counterparts that measure how difficult it is to see that all trivial words in a",
    " visible \" finite presentation of the fundamental group of @xmath120 are , indeed , trivial ( or , more concretely , the maximum over all trivial words of a given length of the minimal area of a van kampen diagram for the considered word ) . more specifically , we would like to consider complements to @xmath116 in @xmath108 , @xmath119 in the standard @xmath26 and to establish that 1 ) the values of @xmath132 for these complements are similarly growing functions of @xmath11 ; 2 ) @xmath132 for the complements of @xmath116 in @xmath108 is a not reasonably growing function of @xmath11 , as its growth is more or less the same as the growth of the area of van kampen diagrams required to demonstrate that the groups of these @xmath0-knots are trivial ( see theorem 2.1 ) ; and 3 ) if knots @xmath119 in the standard @xmath26 can be untied through @xmath0-knots of not too high complexity , then the second of these two filling functions is reasonably growing . taken together these three facts",
    "establish that the constructed @xmath0-knots can be untied only through @xmath0-knots of a very high complexity .",
    "one technical difficulty that arises here is the following : as the considered complements to @xmath0-sphere are not compact , it is not clear that the values of @xmath132 for the considered complements are finite .",
    "more specifically , one can have contractible curves in , say , @xmath113 that include many very short arcs that go around @xmath116 in opposite directions .",
    "also , the proof of the existence of @xmath132 given above used the existence of @xmath156 such that all closed curves of length @xmath152 are contractible ( and even contractible by a length non - increasing homotopy ) .",
    "therefore , we are going to remove not only the @xmath0-knots but also their open tubular neighborhoods with radii given as the inverse values of a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "more specifically , we proceed as follows .    in order to establish",
    "that @xmath119 can not be untied through @xmath0-knots of a not too high complexity we proceed by contradiction .",
    "we assume that @xmath119 in the standard @xmath26 can be isotoped to the standard unknot through @xmath0-knots of complexity that is a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",

    "we modify our idea and consider the complements to @xmath164 in @xmath108 and @xmath165 in a round @xmath26 rather than to @xmath116 and @xmath119 . in this way we obtain compact metric spaces and",
    "immediately see that their @xmath132 are finite .",
    "moreover , the boundaries of these spaces are hypersurfaces ( diffeomorphic to @xmath166 ) with principal curvatures bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",

    "now we are going to prove the following three lemmae :      the assertion of the lemma immediately follows from the fact that lipschitz constants of @xmath117 and its inverse are bounded by reasonably growing functions of @xmath11 .",
    "( we explained this fact at the end of the previous section . )",
    "this easily implies that @xmath171 and @xmath172 are also bi - lipschitz homeomorphic with both lipschitz constants bounded by reasonably growing functions .",

    "let us respresent @xmath71 by a sufficientlyly short loop in @xmath171 and contract it to a point via loops of length @xmath175 , where @xmath176 is a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "each of these intermediate loops can be first homotoped to a loop in the @xmath0-skeleton of @xmath169 that can be regarded as the @xmath0-dimensional dehn complex corresponding to the finite presentation @xmath64 , and afterwards almost canonically represented as the product by @xmath177 of loops representing the generators of @xmath64 . ",
    "almost canonically \" means that the only ambiguities appear as the result of having different ways to represent the same loop @xmath88 by a small number of short words that correspond to relators of @xmath64 .",
    "the number of these small words is proportional to the length of @xmath88 and is , therefore , bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "these amiguities will correspond to the discontinuities in our presentations of loops by words , and together will provide a representation of @xmath71 as the product of conjugates of words corresponding to these ambiguities . as the length of words",
    "is also bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 , so will be the number of cells in the corresponding van kampen diagram .",
    "this completes the proof of lemma 4.2 .",
    "( note that this argument is very similar to an analogous argument in the proof of proposition 2.1 in our paper [ ln ] . )          to prove lemma 4.3 we assume that the constructed trivial knots can be untied through knots @xmath178 $ ] of complexity bounded by a reasonably growing function . as we are considering the smooth case",
    ", we can assume that the areas of the knots during the homotopy are between @xmath42 and @xmath159 , where @xmath79 is a reasonably growing function , and the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map during a contracting isotopy is bounded below by @xmath160 , where @xmath161 is also a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "now our goal is to demonstrate that any closed curve @xmath88 of length @xmath179 in @xmath180 can be contracted with an increase of length bounded by a constant factor ( say , @xmath181 ) .",
    "if @xmath88 is not in @xmath176-neighborhood of @xmath182 , then it is a convex metric ball of radius @xmath183 in @xmath26 and can be contracted within this ball without any length increase .",
    "otherwise , it can be homotoped along outer normals to @xmath182 to the outer boundary of the @xmath176-neighborhood of @xmath182 ( or , equivalently , @xmath184-neighborhood of @xmath168 ) .",
    "note that the length of each arc of @xmath88 under the projection increases less than by a factor of @xmath0 .",
    "it is easy to homotope @xmath88 to its projection that we denote @xmath185 through curves of length less than @xmath186 .",
    "( first , we continuously grow two copies of the normal between a point of @xmath88 and its projection on @xmath187",
    ". then we start moving one of the copies of the normal by moving its endpoints along @xmath88 and , correspondingly , @xmath185 .",
    "the intermediate curves consist of a constantly shrinking arc of @xmath88 , an expanding arc of @xmath185 and the two normals .",
    "finally , this connecting normal returns to the original segment , and we cancel two copies of the original segment . )",
    "now , one can contract @xmath185 inside a convex metric ball of radius @xmath176 in @xmath26 without a length increase .",
    "this argument applies to the complement of @xmath163-neighborhood of any @xmath0-knot @xmath4 in @xmath26 such that its area and the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map satisfy the same bounds as the bounds for @xmath168 .",
    "now we can adapt the argument from [ n2 ] to prove that if two such @xmath0-knots @xmath188 and @xmath189 with the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map greater than @xmath160 and volume between @xmath42 and @xmath159 are @xmath190-close , then the values of @xmath132 for the complements of @xmath191 differ from each other by not more than a constant factor ( say , @xmath192 ) .",
    "the idea that in order to contract a contractible closed curve @xmath153 in , say , the complement to @xmath193 , one can transfer the curve to ( the close in gromov - hausdorff metric ) complement of @xmath194 without a significant length increase , contract the resulting curve @xmath155 there , discretize the contracting homotopy , transfer it back to the complement of @xmath194 and  fill \" the discretized homotopy . in order for this program to work one need to be able to contract without a significant length increase  short \" closed curves of length that does not exceed the distance between the complements to @xmath195 times an appropriate constant .",
    "note that in order to see that @xmath155 is contractible in the complement of @xmath194 we can construct a contracting homotopy by similarly  transfering \" a homotopy contractiung @xmath153 in the complement to @xmath193 .",
    "see [ n2 ] for detailed descriptions of such transfers .",
    "this argument works , for example , if the distance between @xmath196 does not exceed @xmath197 .",
    "now note that the isotopy between the standard unknot and given unknot can be replaced by a sequence of  jumps \" of  length \" @xmath198 where the number of jumps is bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 . here  length \" means the hausdorff distance between the considered knots .",
    "the number of these jumps is bounded by twice the number of pairwise disjoint metric balls of radius @xmath199-net in the considered space of hypersurfaces in @xmath26 satisfying the same bounds for the volume and lower bounds ( @xmath163 ) for the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map as @xmath182 for @xmath0-knots @xmath168 .",
    "indeed , we can replace any subsequence of  jumps \" where the distance between the beginning and the end does not exceed @xmath199 by just one jump .",
    "now note that sizes of @xmath200-nets in the space of hypersurfaces in @xmath26 with areas between @xmath42 and a reasonably growing function , and the injectivity radius of the normal exponential map bounded below by the inverse of a reasonably growing function is also bounded by a reasonably growing function .",
    "such a bound will follow from any proof of the precompactness of the corresponding space of of hypersurfaces of bounded complexity and volume ( cf .",
    "one possible idea is to represent these hypersurfaces as zero sets of appropriate @xmath201-functions that vary in the same way along each normal segment to the hypersurface from @xmath202 and @xmath42 .",
    "it is easy to majorize @xmath201-norms of these functions in terms of the available data , and to use a standard effective proof of the ascoli - arzela theorem ( see [ n ] for the details of this argument ) .    since the change of @xmath132 of the complements to the neighborhoods of @xmath0-knots under such jumps does not exceed an explicit constant factor ( cf .",
    "[ n2 ] , [ ln ] ) , we can start at the standard unknot ,  jump \" back to the given @xmath0-knot and observe that @xmath132 for the complement ito its open neighbourhood of radius @xmath163 does not exceed @xmath203 , which is bounded by a reasonably growing function of @xmath11 .",
    "note that one can do a similar argument for @xmath0-knots in @xmath2 instead of @xmath26 , but in order to have the desired compactness one needs to transfer all @xmath0-knots during isotopies to a neighborhood of the origin ( by appropriate translations ) .          ,",
