    "quantum networks have recently attracted much interest due to their potential applications in quantum computing , communication , metrology , and simulation  @xcite .",
    "quantum information is generated , stored and processed in individual quantum systems ( quantum nodes ) and connected via quantum channels .",
    "one of the attractive features of quantum networks is in the flexibility that such a method offers in terms of the way that the quantum nodes are connected .",
    "typically photonic channels are used for transmission of quantum information .",
    "photons are suitable for the quantum channels due to their ability to carry quantum information over long distances with modest decoherence .",
    "dedicated tasks like quantum key distribution can already be achieved using send - only emitter nodes and recieve - only detector nodes  @xcite .",
    "two well - studied approaches for quantum nodes are atomic ensembles  @xcite and single atoms  @xcite .",
    "recently the experimental realization of an elementary quantum network of single atoms in optical cavities was presented  @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , advances in atom chip technology have led to the ability of precise coherent control of two component bose - einstein condensates  @xcite . in these works ,",
    "a combination of microwave and radio frequency pulses were used to control the hyperfine states of @xmath0 atoms coherently , such that an arbitrary position on the collective bloch sphere could be realized .",
    "furthermore , strong coupling between the excited state of a @xmath1 bec  @xcite and an optical cavity has been achieved  @xcite , as well as generation of remote entanglement between a single atom inside an optical cavity and a bec  @xcite .    on the theoretical side ,",
    "we have previously studied the possibility of performing quantum computation based on such `` bec qubits '' @xcite .",
    "the primary difference between such two - component becs and other proposals for quantum information processing is in the nature of how qubit information is encoded physically .",
    "this can be seen most simply for a single bec qubit , where we encode the standard qubit state @xmath2 in the following state @xmath3 obey bosonic commutation relations , and @xmath4 is the number of bosons in the bec .",
    "the state ( [ becqubit ] ) is a spin coherent state and has been studied in several contexts before @xcite .",
    "the above spin coherent state lives in a @xmath5 dimensional hilbert space and is therefore clearly not a genuine two - level qubit system .",
    "nevertheless , it has many analogous properties to standard qubits , which were exploited in the proposal of ref .",
    "encoding quantum information in the form ( [ becqubit ] ) is attractive due to the great redundancy that the state possesses .",
    "for example , in a typical bec @xmath6-@xmath7 and thus the same qubit information is duplicated a very large number of times .",
    "therefore , even in the presence of losses and decoherence , the quantum information is not easily lost due to the sheer number of copies of the state .",
    "the problem is then how the state ( [ becqubit ] ) can be used perform quantum information tasks , since it is not strictly equivalent to a qubit state . a priori",
    "it is not clear how , or if it is possible at all , to perform tasks such as quantum algorithms using such bec qubits . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that such states could be manipulated analogously to standard qubits , and quantum algorithms could be implemented when many such bec qubits are combined together .",
    "one of the key results of ref .",
    "@xcite is that , in analogy with standard qubits , one and two bec qubit interactions are necessary in order to perform universal quantum computation .",
    "it was also shown that tasks such as quantum teleportation is possible using bec qubits @xcite .",
    "all of these protocols rely on the presence of a two qubit gate , most usually of the form @xmath8 .",
    "currently , no schemes for implementing such an interaction exist , although works proposed originally for single atomic systems , such as ref .",
    "@xcite , could be generalized to the bec case .    in this paper",
    "we show how to create a @xmath8 entangling interaction between the nodes of the quantum network , which is fundamental to many tasks quantum information processing tasks described above .",
    "we analyze the performance of the scheme under imperfect conditions with decoherence inducing processes such as spontaneous emission , photon loss , and general dephasing .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : entgen ] we introduce the basic protocol for entanglement generation and show that it creates a @xmath8 hamiltonian . in section [ sec : dec ]",
    "we discuss the effects of decoherence , induced by spontaneous emission and photon loss .",
    "experimentally achievable parameters are estimated in section [ sec : numbers ] based on the decoherence estimates .",
    "finally , we conclude and summarize our findings in section [ sec : conc ] .",
    "in this section we describe the protocol for entanglement generation , where an effective @xmath8 interaction is created between two particular nodes @xmath9 on a quantum network .",
    "each of the becs are placed in a cavity and are connected by optical fiber  @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the basic idea of the scheme .",
    "becs are placed in an optical cavity off - resonantly tuned to the @xmath10 transition , and are mutually connected by optical fiber .",
    "such optical cavities have been already achieved on atom chip systems @xcite .",
    "the becs on each of the nodes are initially in an arbitrary state of the form ( [ becqubit ] ) , where the operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 are associated with the hyperfine ground states @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . without the application of lasers on the becs , the state of the system is stable , as the cavities are off - resonant to the transitions to the excited states .",
    "the two qubit interaction can be turned on and off between two particular nodes as desired by the application of an off - resonant laser tuned between the @xmath15 states .",
    "this completes the second order virtual transition of an atom being excited into the @xmath16 and relaxing back into the original @xmath17 state , which allows for the two bec qubit interaction to be implemented . since the nodes are only `` on '' when the lasers completing the virtual transition between the @xmath15 states , many such cavities can be connected together into a quantum network ( figure [ fig1]b ) , where entanglement can be generated between nodes on demand .",
    "a more mathematical description of the scheme is as follows .",
    "the cavity is modeled by a single quantized mode coupled to the transition @xmath18 with coupling strength @xmath19 .",
    "atoms in the excited state @xmath20 are denoted @xmath21 , and those in state @xmath22 are denoted @xmath23 , where @xmath24 label the nodes where the entanglement is to be generated .",
    "the state @xmath25 , labeled as @xmath26 , constituting the remaining logical state encoding the bec qubit state ( [ becqubit ] ) .",
    "the cavity qed hamiltonian for the bosonic case is @xmath27 where @xmath28 are the cavity photon annihilation operators for each node @xmath29 .",
    "the detuning between the transition to the excited state and the cavity photon resonance is @xmath30 .",
    "the hamiltonian describing the coupling between the cavity modes and fiber mode reads  @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the cavity ",
    "fiber coupling strength and @xmath33 is the phase due to propagation of the field through the fiber .",
    "we consider the short fiber limit @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the length of the fiber and @xmath36 is the decay rate of the cavity field into the continuum of the fiber modes . in this case only the resonant mode @xmath37 of the fiber interacts with the cavity modes  @xcite . using the canonical transformations @xmath38",
    "@xmath39 @xmath40 we can rewrite @xmath41 in diagonal representation @xmath42    assuming the modes @xmath43 and @xmath44 are off resonant we may then only consider the collective mode @xmath45 alone .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian of whole system is then @xmath46 using adiabatic condition with large detuning @xmath47 , we may neglect the effects of very rapidly varying terms and adiabatically eliminate the photons and excited levels from our scheme  @xcite .",
    "following the standard procedure for adiabatic elimination and setting @xmath48 , we obtain @xmath49 , \\nonumber \\\\ ce_2^\\dagger & = -\\frac{g}{\\sqrt{2}\\delta } \\left [ ( e_2^\\dagger e_2-c^\\dagger c)e^{-i\\phi}b_2^\\dagger - e_1 e_2^\\dagger b_1^\\dagger \\right ] .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] substituting the expressions of eq .",

    "we may then adiabatically eliminate the excited state by assuming @xmath52 , which gives the relations @xmath53 and @xmath54 . rewriting this in terms of spin",
    "operators @xmath55 and number operators @xmath56 gives up to constant terms @xmath57 \\nonumber \\\\ & + \\left [ \\hbar \\omega ( n(\\cos \\phi -1 ) + 2\\cos \\phi ) - \\frac{g^2 \\hbar \\omega_0 } { 2 \\delta } \\right ] ( s^z_1 + s^z_2 ) \\label{effectiveham1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and have assumed a constant number of bosons @xmath59 for each bec and the photon number is small .",
    "we thus see that two qubit interactions can be produced , as well as effective self - interaction terms @xmath60 and rotation terms @xmath61 .",
    "the single qubit rotation terms are relatively harmless as these may be compensated for assuming single qubit control is available , using existing methods such as that described in ref .",
    ". however , the self - interaction terms are an unwanted by - product of the procedure and require elimination in order to obtain a pure @xmath62 interaction .    to eliminate the unwanted terms , we note that a similar procedure but blocking the optical fiber connection produces the same quadratic terms as ( [ effectiveham1 ] ) but without the interaction term @xmath62 . performing the same adiabatic elimination steps directly on ( [ hamiltonian0 ] ) by first eliminating @xmath63 , then @xmath64 yields @xmath65 - \\left [ n\\hbar \\omega ' + \\frac{g^2 \\hbar \\omega_0 } { 2 \\delta ' } \\right ] ( s^z_1 + s^z_2 ) .",
    "\\label{effectiveham2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath66 where we have assumed a different value of the detuning for generality . to make the undesired terms cancel we may choose the detuning @xmath67 , which reverses the sign of ( [ effective2qubit2 ] ) .",
    "the procedure for implementing a pure @xmath62 interaction is then as follows : ( i ) apply ( [ effectiveham1 ] ) for a desired time @xmath68 .",
    "( ii ) apply ( [ effectiveham2 ] ) with the reverse detuning @xmath69 for a time @xmath70 .",
    "this then implements the total hamiltonian @xmath71 ( s^z_1 + s^z_2 ) \\label{effectivehamtot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for a time @xmath72 as desired .",
    "an alternative procedure would be to adjust the phase @xmath73 in ( [ effectiveham1 ] ) to turn off the @xmath62 interaction term by choosing @xmath74 . by again reversing the detuning",
    "allows to cancel the undesired self - interaction terms .",
    "the form of the entanglement is a continuous version of that produced in standard qubits , and together with one qubit gates form a universal gate set that can be used to construct quantum algorithms @xcite and is required for teleportation schemes @xcite .",
    "the state that is created using the @xmath62 interaction is more complicated than for standard qubits , thus is a non - trivial problem to analyze its properties , and the effects of decoherence(see ref .",
    "@xcite for more details ) . to illustrate the complexity of the state , consider two bec qubits in maximal @xmath75-eigenstates .",
    "the evolved state is @xmath76 where @xmath77 are eigenstates of @xmath61 ( fock states ) . despite the state",

    "@xcite that such a hamiltonian can be used to make the analogue of the cnot operation for bec qubits . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that teleportation of spin coherent states could be performed with @xmath78 . in this paper",
    "we do not study the types of states that are generated , and refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite . in section [ sec",
    ": dec ] we will be concerned with how when the scheme described above can reliably create entangled states with various decohering effects .",
    "decoherence effects in becs and cavity qed model have been the subject of many works  @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the effect of decoherence on the scheme introduced in the previous section .",
    "specifically , as excited states such as @xmath16 are used in our proposed scheme , it is important to analyze effects of spontaneous emission , which contributes to decoherence .",
    "another potential source of decoherence is photon loss from the cavity .",
    "the way we will approach the problem is to estimate the effects of these processes separately by breaking the problem into parts and examining each of the processes in a prototypical configuration .",
    "this approach will make clear what the important sources of decoherence to the scheme are , and how to avoid them .",
    "special emphasis will be made on the scaling properties of the decoherence with the atom number @xmath4 , which is typically a large number in our case .",
    "this will identify what kind of parameters need to be chosen for the current scheme . from this",
    "we obtain simple formulas for the decoherence rates for each process . the typical experimentally achievable parameters for bec entanglement",
    "are then estimated using these formulas in section [ sec : numbers ] .      to analyze the effect of spontaneous emission on the coherence of becs",
    ", we consider a minimal model where single bec qubit transitions via an adiabatic passage through an excited state .",
    "the excited state is considered to be unstable towards spontaneous emission , where it can decay to either one of the ground states ( see figure [ fig3]a ) . to model this , we consider the master equation @xmath79 - \\frac{\\gamma_s}{2 } \\left [ e^\\dagger a a^\\dagger e \\rho - 2 a^\\dagger e \\rho e^\\dagger a + \\rho e^\\dagger a a^\\dagger e \\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & - \\frac{\\gamma_s}{2 } \\left [ e^\\dagger b b^\\dagger e \\rho - 2 b^\\dagger e \\rho e^\\dagger b + \\rho e^\\dagger b b^\\dagger e \\right ] \\label{spontaneousmaster}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is @xmath81 here we have assumed for simplicity that the coupling @xmath82 to the intermediate level from the logical states @xmath11 and @xmath12 are equal , and @xmath83 is the detuning of the laser between states @xmath84 to the excited state @xmath85 . to a very good approximation , eq .",
    "( [ spontaneousmaster ] ) can be solved for arbitrary @xmath4 . from the heisenberg equations of motion",
    ", we may derive equations for the expectation values @xmath86 where quartic products of bosonic operators were approximated by products of quadratic correlations .",
    "this allows for a closed set of equations ( [ spontaneouseqs ] ) , which together with their complex conjugates can be solved numerically . comparison of the exact solutions of ( [ spontaneousmaster ] ) for small boson numbers show virtually perfect agreement with ( [ spontaneouseqs ] ) .",
    "results of the simulation are shown in figure [ fig3]b .",
    "we see that for large detunings @xmath87 , rabi oscillations occur between the levels @xmath11 and @xmath12 with a characteristic frequency @xmath88 the spontaneous emission introduces a decoherence to the oscillations , which increase with @xmath4 . from the decay envelope of the oscillations , it is possible to estimate the decoherence rates induced by the spontaneous emission .",
    "we find almost perfect linear behavior in @xmath4 and inverse quadratic behavior in the detuning @xmath83 ( figures [ fig3]c and [ fig3]d ) .",
    "the rate of the decoherence can be simply summarized by the formula @xmath89 the decay envelope @xmath90 $ ] is plotted together with the simulated results in figure [ fig3]b .",
    "we see that the ( [ effectiveonequbitdecoherence ] ) gives good quantitative agreement with the data .    to understand the origin of the proportionality with @xmath91 of the decoherence rate , let us consider a simpler toy model of spontaneous decay between two levels populated by @xmath4 atoms .",
    "in this case the master equation is @xmath92   \\label{simplespontaneousmaster}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath85 is an excited state and @xmath11 is a ground state . noting that the master equation conserves total particle number @xmath93 , it can be solved by finding the equations of motion @xmath94 where we have used the approximation @xmath95 .",
    "this allows for a solution @xmath96 , \\label{spon2qubit}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath97 is a constant depending upon the initial conditions .",
    "we see that the time constant within the hyperbolic function is proportional to @xmath98 , which can be attributed to bosonic final state stimulation @xcite .",
    "the effect of a large number of bosons is that it enhances the dissipation rate @xmath99 .",
    "for the lambda scheme ( [ spontaneousmaster ] ) examined above this results in a decoherence rate of the rabi oscillations also accelerated by a factor @xmath91 .",
    "the linear scaling of ( [ effectiveonequbitdecoherence ] ) with @xmath4 may seem detrimental to the effectiveness of the two qubit gate proposed in the previous section , as @xmath4 is typically a very large number in typical becs .",
    "however , the quadratic scaling of @xmath100 with @xmath83 allows for a compensation of the large @xmath4 via increasing the detuning to a sufficient amount .",
    "this naturally decreases the rabi frequency @xmath101 , so one must choose the parameters to optimize this trade - off .",
    "numerical parameters which satisfy this will be shown in section [ sec : numbers ] .",
    "another mechanism of decoherence is via photon loss from the cavity and optical fiber .",
    "the model that we will consider is shown in figure [ fig4]a with the master equation @xmath102 - \\frac{\\gamma_c}{2 } \\left [ p^\\dagger p \\rho - 2 p \\rho p^\\dagger + \\rho p^\\dagger p \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath103 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 is the transition frequency , and @xmath107 is the photon annihilation operator .",
    "the basis of considering such a model is as follows .",
    "starting from ( [ hamiltonian0 ] ) we may derive ( [ cavityphotondecay ] ) by substituting the diagonalized expressions for the photon mode in ( [ ham_fib ] ) . in the protocol of section [ sec : entgen ]",
    ", there are additional lasers corresponding to the @xmath82 transitions in figure [ fig1]a .",
    "the purposes of these are twofold .",
    "firstly they are to avoid storage of the quantum information in excited states , which give undesirable effects of spontaneous emission as discussed in the previous section .",
    "due to the adiabatic passage through the excited state , the population in these states are kept to a very low level at all times , which mitigates the spontaneous emission problem .",
    "secondly , the lasers give on / off control to the two bec qubit gate such that entanglement can be generated between nodes as desired . in our current analysis",
    "we may ignore both of these aspects as we would like to concentrate only on the effects of photon loss to the fidelity of the two qubit gate .",
    "thus we may consider the effect of the laser to connect levels @xmath108 and @xmath109 , giving rise to the hamiltonian ( [ qubushamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the basic effect of ( [ qubushamiltonian ] ) may be understood by examining the limit of very large detuning @xmath30 . by adiabatically eliminating the photons in a similar way to ref .",
    "@xcite , we obtain the effective hamiltonian @xmath110 where @xmath111 eq . ( [ simpleentangler ] ) is an entangling two bec qubit hamiltonian .",
    "we expect that the cavity photon decay will add a decohering effect to the dominant effect described by ( [ simpleentangler ] ) .",
    "we solve ( [ cavityphotondecay ] ) by time evolving the density matrix numerically .",
    "assuming @xmath4 bosons per node @xmath112 , the basis states @xmath113 may be taken .",
    "the number of basis states may be restricted by noticing that the @xmath114 conserves the number of excited states @xmath115 this allows us to eliminate @xmath116 in favor of @xmath117 and use an alternative basis set latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath135 . considering dephasing in the @xmath136 direction first , it is possible to analytically solve ( [ twoqubitdephasing ] ) given an initial state @xmath137 , yielding @xmath138 initially preparing the state @xmath139 , evolving under ( [ twoqubitdephasing ] ) , and calculating the expectation values @xmath140 yields figure [ fig5]a .",
    "we see that at points corresponding to integer multiples of @xmath141 , the curves for different @xmath4 coincide .",
    "this is in fact true for all @xmath4 , and is possible to derive the relation @xmath142 that is , in the presence of @xmath143-decoherence , the expectation value of @xmath144 is simply multiplied by a factor of @xmath145 .",
    "one would naively conclude that decoherence does not have an @xmath4 dependence , and is not enhanced due to the large number of bosons in the bec .",
    "however , we shall see below that this is a special case , as we happened to consider a decoherence operator which commutes with the entangling hamiltonian , which means that the dynamics of the decoherence and interaction are independent .    for the above reasons it is more instructive to consider the case where the decoherence and the entangling hamiltonian does not commute , i.e. @xmath146 . in figure",
    "[ fig5]b we show results showing the expectation value of @xmath147 given the same initial conditions as figure [ fig5]a . we see that in this case there is a degradation of the oscillations with increasing @xmath4 .",
    "we phenomenologically find that the effective decoherence rate of the peaks obeys @xmath148 some insight to the origin of this enhanced decoherence can be obtained by examining the states that are produced at particular entangling times .",
    "for example , with zero decoherence and at time @xmath149 , the state ( [ entangledstate ] ) can be written @xcite @xmath150 this is a entangled schrodinger cat state , and is generally very susceptible to decoherence .",
    "thus when the states created are of this fragile nature , the effects of decoherence are enhanced due to the large number of bosons , and decay with the enhanced rate ( [ accdec ] ) .    fortunately , for quantum information processing applications , states such as ( [ schrodingercat ] ) are typically not necessary . in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the analogue of the cnot operation could be implemented with gate times @xmath151 . for quantum teleportation ,",
    "gate times of @xmath152 are required @xcite .",
    "therefore it is of more practical relevance to understand the effects of the decoherence at these gate times , instead of the long gate times of @xmath153 as plotted in figs .",
    "[ fig5]a and [ fig5]b .",
    "we may study the effect of the decoherence on these short times by applying the same strategy as that used in cavity photon loss in figure [ fig4]b . namely we perform the following sequence : ( i ) evolve ( [ twoqubitdephasing ] ) with @xmath154 for a time @xmath155 ;",
    "( ii ) evolve the resulting state under ( [ twoqubitdephasing ] ) with @xmath154 , but with @xmath156 as the hamiltonian for the same time @xmath155 ; ( iii ) measure the error , defined to be @xmath157 .",
    "the effect of decoherence for various gate times is shown in figure [ fig5]c .",
    "we see that the error for various gate times has very different behavior . specifically , for gate times of order @xmath158 the errors increase , as suggested in the results of fig .",
    "however , for gate times @xmath159 the errors stay mostly constant with @xmath4 , and for short gate times the errors decrease with @xmath4 .",
    "this can be understood to be due to the gate time reducing for @xmath151 , which results in less time for the dephasing to take effect .",
    "the border between these two behaviors can be seen to be @xmath160 .",
    "the above results show that states with @xmath161 are relatively stable against decoherence , while states with @xmath162 are more delicate due to the enhanced decoherence effects originating from the large number of atoms in the bec .",
    "the origin is due to the nature of the states that are produced . for gate times",
    "@xmath163 , schrodinger cat - like states ( [ schrodingercat ] ) tend to be produced , which are well - known to be highly susceptible to decoherence .",
    "we note that similar results were found in ref .",
    "we now estimate some numbers for achievable gate times for the two bec qubit gate using currently available technology .",
    "our primary constraints are in the quality of the cavities , for which we assume parameters given in ref . @xcite . in our current notation",
    "this corresponds to @xmath164 , @xmath165 , and @xmath166 , where @xmath167 is the single atom cavity coupling .",
    "since there are a large number of bec atoms in the cavity , in our case @xmath168 where the @xmath169 comes from the collective atomic enhancement @xcite . in order to effectively perform the adiabatic passage through the excited state in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a , it is optimal to choose the control lasers to have the same strength as the cavity .",
    "we thus have a further constraint @xmath170 to overcome spontaneous emission , we need to choose the detuning sufficiently large such that the factor of @xmath5 in the numerator of ( [ effectiveonequbitdecoherence ] ) is canceled off . choosing @xmath171 , and substituting into ( [ sponeffg ] ) , ( [ effectiveonequbitdecoherence ] ) , ( [ caveffg ] ) , and ( [ cavityphotondecoherence ] ) we obtain @xmath172 where @xmath173 is a dimensionless detuning parameter which may be freely chosen to adjust the parameters above . for the numerical estimates above , @xmath174 and @xmath175",
    "are chosen .",
    "we see that the coherent coupling greatly exceeds the effective decoherence values , showing that the processes of spontaneous emission and photon decay may be overcome by a suitable choice of detuning .    for the combined interaction , substituting numbers into ( [ effective2qubit ] ) we estimate @xmath176 which may appear on first glance appear to be a poor result in comparison to the decoherence rates in ( [ decoestimates ] )",
    ". however , as discussed in the previous section , for quantum information processing applications , only short gate times are typically necessary .",
    "such gates can be completed within the decoherence times shown .",
    "for example , to perform the analogue of the cnot gate , interaction times of @xmath177 are required . calculating the ratio of the timescale for decoherence due to spontaneous decay @xmath178 to gate time , we estimate @xmath179 showing many cnot gates can be produced within the decoherence time .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to expect that our proposed scheme can be used to create entangled states despite the enhanced spontaneous decay rates due to the large number of atoms in the bec .",
    "we have proposed a method for generating @xmath8 interaction between two - component becs using a system of cavities coupled by optical fiber .",
    "the scheme uses a `` quantum bus '' of photons to effectively couple becs together , and is controllable between any two nodes on the quantum network via local lasers .",
    "the main enemies of the scheme are spontaneous emission and photon loss , which creates an effective decoherence . in particular ,",
    "spontaneous decay is enhanced by a factor of @xmath180 , the number of bosons in the bec . despite this , by choosing a sufficiently large detuning it was shown that two bec qubit gates can be created within the estimated decoherence times .",
    "it was also shown that states with @xmath181 should be stable against decoherence while those with @xmath182 tend to be more fragile .",
    "this is due to the schrodinger cat - like states that are produced for longer times , which are more susceptible to decoherence @xcite .",
    "an alternative scheme would involve not using excited states at all , and using microwave cavities such as that proposed in refs .",
    "this would reduce spontaneous decay effects and in this case the dominant decoherence mechanism would result from cavity decay .",
    "the formalism developed here could still be equally applied by a simple modification of the definitions assumed here .",
