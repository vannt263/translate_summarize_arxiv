    "in a great variety of non - equilibrium situations , critical behavior is observed as a system evolves from one of its possible states to another .",
    "some examples are charge density waves , fluctuating interfaces and lines , cracks and fractures , and the barkhausen effect in magnets .",
    "these systems evolve , respectively , from a state without current to a state with current , from a stationary to a moving state , from a connected to a ruptured state , from a downward to an upward magnetization . under specific conditions ( _ i.e. _ preparation of the system ) , the transition between the two states is critical ( or continuous ) , exhibiting diverging correlation lengths , and scaling laws .",
    "the qualitative descriptions of the dynamics of the different physical situations mentioned are very similar in the key parameters and mechanisms which govern criticality .",
    "the quantitative descriptions are also close , in that the dynamics of motion can be described by continuum field equations , and share many common features . in this article",
    "we focus on magnetic systems .",
    "more specifically , on a lattice of spins with ferromagnetic exchange ( coupling ) . while our qualitative and quantitative analyses will be in this framework , some aspects of the discussion may apply to other systems , such as depinning transition of flux lines or fractures in disordered media .",
    "what do we mean by `` the key parameters and mechanisms which govern criticality '' ? consider a ferromagnet in an external magnetic field which increases slowly from @xmath1 to @xmath2 .",
    "each spin feels a local field equal to the average of the surrounding spins multiplied by the coupling constant ( @xmath3 in the case of the @xmath4 spin ) , plus the external magnetic field @xmath5 . at @xmath6 ,",
    "all the spins point `` downward '' ( @xmath7 for unit spins ) , thus @xmath8 initially . at zero temperature",
    ", each spin simply points in the direction of the local field @xmath9 , and so none of the spins change before @xmath5 reaches @xmath10 , at which point they all flip upwards .",
    "the magnetization @xmath11 thus jumps from @xmath12 to @xmath13 at @xmath14 .",
    "this scenario for a perfectly clean system is modified by introducing some disorder . at each lattice point",
    "occupied by a spin , add a random field , @xmath15 , to the local field , @xmath9 .",
    "( specifically , let @xmath15 be an uncorrelated random variable , chosen from a gaussian distribution centered at zero . ) then , the spins flip in a much less coherent way : as soon as @xmath16becomes positive , the @xmath4 spin flips .",
    "the upward @xmath15 s enhance the increase in magnetization for low @xmath5 , whereas the downward @xmath15 s suppress it for high @xmath5 .",
    "this results in the reduction of the magnitude of the jump in magnetization . clearly , if we broaden the random field distribution , _",
    "i.e. _ increase the amount of disorder , the discontinuity in @xmath11 is further suppressed , until the curve @xmath17 eventually becomes smooth for a high enough disorder ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "we can imagine a sequence of hysteresis curves , corresponding to a succession of increasing amounts of disorder , say for the variance of the random field , @xmath18 , going from zero to infinity .",
    "the curve displays a discontinuity for small @xmath18 , and is smooth for large @xmath18 .",
    "the transition between the two regimes occurs at a critical point reminiscent of continuous or second - order phase transitions @xcite : at the critical amount of disorder the discontinuity collapses to a point , at which the slope is infinite .",
    "this is referred to as a _",
    "critical hysteresis _ , for which , at a given magnetic field , the susceptibility diverges .",
    "the amount of disorder and the magnetic field are the two parameters we have to tune to observe criticality .",
    "= 16truecm    in the last few years , disorder - induced critical hysteresis in magnets has been the subject of much interest@xcite .",
    "dahmen , sethna , and others studied *  * this problem via a mean - field approximation , one - loop momentum - space renormalization , and numerical simulations .",
    "also , they describe a mapping of this non - equilibrium problem onto the equilibrium random field ising model , which can in turn be mapped ( close to the upper critical dimension ) onto the pure ising model in two lower dimensions@xcite . throughout their work",
    ", they consider a scalar order parameter .",
    "they study the dynamics of an ising ( or discrete ) spin field driven by an increasing magnetic field and in the presence of a random field , at zero temperature .",
    "the question we ask here is the following : how are the phase diagram and critical behavior modified if the order parameter is vectorial instead of scalar ?",
    "more precisely stated : in the renormalization group ( rg ) framework , is the fixed point which controls the above - mentioned hysteretic criticality , one and the same for both the ising and the vectorial cases ? and if not , how do the exponents differ ?",
    "in equilibrium , the disordering of scalar and vector systems is described by distinct universality classes@xcite .",
    "also , in the closely related context of depinning transitions , the distinction between interfaces ( scalar ) and flux lines ( vector ) was noted in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the answer can readily be guessed on symmetry grounds .",
    "indeed , symmetry considerations lead to two distinct cases . in the first , _ and generic one _ ,",
    "the critical hysteresis curve is such that the susceptibility diverges at a non - vanishing value of either the magnetic field or the magnetization .",
    "then , although we consider continuous spins , the full rotational symmetry of the problem is broken at the critical point , a unique preferred direction is picked , and ising - like critical behavior results .",
    "it is similarly argued , in ref .",
    "@xcite , appendix e , and ref .",
    "@xcite , appendix l , that the universality class of the random field scalar model extends also to random bonds scalar models ( with a positive non - zero mean of the bonds values ) and to random anisotropies @xmath0 models . on the other hand ,",
    "if both the magnetic field and the magnetization vanish when the susceptibility diverges , we may have a fully rotation invariant system at the critical point . in that case",
    ", we expect @xmath0-like criticality , with exponents that differ from those of the ising model .",
    "evidently , a vanishing magnetization at @xmath19 is not a sufficient condition for a full rotational invariance . in particular , due to its history , the system might well display higher order anisotropies , such as , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the component of the spin field parallel to @xmath22 and @xmath23 ia any parpendicular component .",
    "this issue is resolved by a renormalization group analysis , which confirms our various guesses .",
    "furthermore , it discloses the possibility of a `` transverse critical point '' , corresponding to an instability of the magnetization component _ perpendicular _ to the external magnetic field .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we construct the equation of motion of a vector spin field .",
    "a path integral formalism is described in sec .",
    "iii , with which the problem of renormalizing the equation of motion is recast into that of renormalizing a partition function .",
    "the time dependences , as well as the subtleties associated with `` many energy minima '' , are also examined . in sec .",
    "iv , the renormalization group treatment of the problem is presented .",
    "first , we define the coordinates and fields rescalings , and calculate the free propagator .",
    "then , we discuss successively the scalar and vector models . for the latter , the different cases ( hysteretic or non - hysteretic , longitudinal or transverse criticality )",
    "are analysed , and the corresponding recursion relations and exponents are obtained .",
    "the equations of motion for a scalar field are discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , and their generalization to a multicomponent field is straightforward .",
    "nonetheless , for completeness and to emphasize our perspective , we present here a didactic introduction to the equations of motion for vectorial spins , at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "consider a @xmath24-dimensional lattice , with a spin @xmath25 at each site @xmath26 , subject to a magnetic field which changes slowly from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , say linearly in time , @xmath27 .",
    "the rate @xmath28 can be made arbitrarily small in magnitude and points along the first axis of our coordinates , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath29 , @xmath30 .",
    "the time dependent magnetic field implies a time dependent energy function @xmath31 . at zero temperature ( @xmath32 )",
    ", the spins simply follow the local minimum of this energy function according to @xmath33 starting from a uniform downward pointing configuration at @xmath34 .",
    "the parameter @xmath35 controls the relaxation rate of spins towards the time - dependent local energy minimum of @xmath36 .",
    "the smaller @xmath35 , the faster spins relax , and the less they lag behind the energy minimum @xcite .",
    "the following `` key features '' guide us in constructing the hamiltonian @xmath36 .",
    "first , to describe a ferromagnet , we include in @xmath36 couplings @xmath37 which tend to align the spins .",
    "in addition to the external uniform field @xmath22 which drives the system , we include quenched random fields @xmath38 .",
    "the @xmath38 s are uncorrelated gaussian random variables , chosen from the distribution @xmath39 = n\\exp \\left ( -\\sum_i \\frac{{\\bf h}_i^2}{2r}\\right ) , \\ ] ] where @xmath40 is a normalization factor . for calculational convenience we shall work with soft spins ( whose magnitude can take any real value ) , which can be thought of as a coarse - grained picture of a hard spin field .",
    "to avoid the unphysical instability of spins diverging in magnitude , we introduce an on - site potential @xmath41 , which constrains the magnitude to remain close to 1 ( or some finite number ) .",
    "the potential @xmath42 is spherically symmetric ( a `` double well '' in the scalar model and a `` mexican hat '' in the vector model ) and is expressed through its taylor expansion about the origin , as @xmath43 whether or not @xmath42 is analytic at the origin is unimportant , since @xmath44 is constrained to be close to 1 ( and not to 0 ) .",
    "the full hamiltonian is now given by @xmath45 .\\ ] ]    the gradient descent with this hamiltonian leads to the equation of motion @xmath46 assuming that @xmath37 is a function of the separation between spins results , in the continuum limit , in @xmath47 while rewriting the problem in the continuum limit , we must impose some limit on how fine - grained the spin field @xmath48 may be because of its lattice origin .",
    "in other words , @xmath48 is a superposition of fourier components whose wave numbers are restricted from zero to some cutoff @xmath49 .",
    "finally , if the exchange function decays fast enough ( as its argument increases ) for its fourier component to be non - singular at the origin of momentum space , _ i.e. _ if @xmath50 , then @xmath51 and the equation of motion can be written as @xmath52 where the coefficient @xmath53 in the the expansion of the potential has been modified in order to take the @xmath54 term of eq .",
    "( [ short - range ] ) into account .",
    "in order to identify the critical properties of our model , we should ideally solve its equation of motion . in practice , we study the behavior of eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) under a coarse - graining transformation .",
    "this allows us to locate and characterize a scale - invariant point . as a first step",
    ", we recast the equation of motion into a path integral ( or generating functional ) , which incorporates the whole history of the system .",
    "the generating functional is written as the sum over all paths of the exponential of some action , which is then renormalized perturbatively .",
    "the advantage of reformulating the problem in this way is that we can express the perturbative treatment in a diagrammatic fashion similar to other field theories .",
    "we define the generating functional @xcite simply as the sum over all paths of a delta function which makes each spin follow the time evolution given by eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) , _ i.e. _    @xmath55    where @xmath56 stands for @xmath57 .",
    "the jacobian merely normalizes the value of @xmath58 to unity , and we shall henceforth ignore it @xcite .",
    "let us rewrite the delta function in its representation as the integral of an exponential [ @xmath59 . then",
    ", after absorbing a factor @xmath26 in a redefinition of @xmath60 , and dropping an infinite multiplicative constant ( along with the jacobian ) , we have    @xmath61    the _ generating functional _ @xmath58 enables us to evaluate all correlation and response functions . for example , the solution of eq .",
    "( [ motion ] ) is @xmath62 and its response to the magnetic field is given by @xmath63 also , we can change the origin of time by a trivial reparametrization of the magnetic field , as _",
    "e.g. _ in @xmath64 the latter expression takes the form @xmath65 if @xmath5 is increased linearly in time at a rate @xmath66 , whence @xmath67 from which it follows that the dynamic susceptibility is calculated as @xmath68 since we are interested in the average of the correlations and responses over the random field , from now on we deal with the average of @xmath58 .",
    "this enables us to forget the stochastic variable @xmath69 , trading it for a new term in the `` averaged action '' . taking advantage of the gaussian nature of @xmath69 ,    @xmath70    with ( using eq .",
    "( [ distribution ] ) ) @xmath71    we have reformulated the theory , originally described by a dynamical differential equation , in terms of an action @xmath72 $ ] , which depends on the entire history of all spins .",
    "thus @xmath73 is a functional of the path which the system follows ; the probability weight @xmath74 picks the physical path and averages it over disorder .",
    "we can then study the symmetries and renormalization of the theory , as for equilibrium field theories .",
    "the motion comprises two time scales : @xmath35 and @xmath75 .",
    "the behavior of the system depends of course on the ratio of the two , and not on their respective values . for the calculation of static exponents ,",
    "we let @xmath76 .",
    "consider for example the exponent @xmath77 , with which the correlation length diverges .",
    "a diverging correlation length gives rise to an infinite susceptibility , detected by a non - vanishing response ( of the magnetization ) to an infinitesimal increase of the magnetic field .",
    "clearly , such a behavior is obtained in our problem only if the magnetic field increases infinitely slowly [ _ i.e. _ @xmath78 , or equivalently , if @xmath76 . as @xmath35 is a measure of how much the system lags behind its local energy minimum",
    ", for @xmath76 the system always stays at the time dependent minimum ( as seen by setting @xmath79 in the equation of motion ) .",
    "in other words , the spin avalanches resulting from a small change in @xmath5 spread instantaneously .    in the @xmath76 limit ,",
    "time evolution of the spin field is simply motion with the minimum in the energy landscape .",
    "there is nevertheless a subtlety involved as to the choice of the minimum .",
    "for example , because of the double - well shape of the potential , a scalar spin has the choice , during some time interval of its history , between two positions , both of which locally minimize the hamiltonian . if we solve the equation of motion , there is no ambiguity , since we specify one of the energy minima as the initial condition , and then follow its time evolution . in particular",
    ", the initial condition corresponding to the case of a magnetic field which increases from @xmath1 to @xmath2 is one in which all the spins occupy the left minimum of their double wells @xcite . in the path",
    "integral formalism , however , no initial condition is specified .",
    "the weight @xmath80 picks all possible solutions , corresponding to different initial conditions .",
    "let us illustrate this point with , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the zero - dimensional non - random version of our model , defined by the equation of motion @xmath81 with @xmath76 .",
    "we can imagine @xmath82 as a bead sitting at the minimum of the quartic potential @xmath83 , and moving with it . with @xmath84 and @xmath85",

    ", the bead sits at the single minimum of the curve , which becomes the left minimum when @xmath5 is between @xmath89 and @xmath88 . at @xmath90 ,",
    "the left minimum disappears and the bead moves to the right minimum .",

    "therefore , _ @xmath96 _ , and in particular , _",
    "@xmath97 _ , in apparent contradiction with the above solution .",
    "but as mentioned earlier , the partition function is merely the integral of a delta function which imposes the equation of motion . in the present case",

    "as mentioned in the introduction , a vanishing magnetization does not a priori ensure a fully rotationally invariant system ; higher moments could in general display anisotropy . in that case , a complete theory would break the rotational symmetry , leading to anisotropic exponents different from @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 above , which are the outcome of a restricted action that properly describes only quantities linear in the spin field .",

    "it is easy to see that , as for the non - random equilibrium thermal landau - ginzburg model , the exponents @xmath298 , @xmath299 , and @xmath300 have a one - to - one correspondance with the exponents that characterize the singular behavior of the magnetization , as well as with those associated with a number of other quantities , such as the correlation length .",
    "this immediately implies an affirmative answer to the above question ; the requirement that the action should describe the physical magnetization is a strong enough constraint for the theory to correctly generate the singularity of , _ e.g. _ , the correlation length .",
    "evidently , this argument does not apply to the critical behavior of higher moments of the spin field distribution , and whether or not the latter are isotropic at criticality is an interesting open question .",
    "in fact , even the isotropy of @xmath298 at the @xmath306 critical point may seem surprising at first , since the history of the system apparently sets up an anisotropic context for the spins motion .",

    "this allows us to obtain , with no further calculational effort , the expansion for @xmath77 to higher orders in @xmath309 @xcite .",

    "in fact , the perturbative calculation we just briefly described is similar to that done by by krey @xcite for the time - dependent thermal random field model , where he calculates @xmath310 to @xmath316 , giving to lowest non - trivial order in @xmath309 , @xmath317 ( here , @xmath119 is the number of components that become massless at criticality . )",
    "the main aim of the present paper was to extend earlier work on critical hysteresis to the case of an ordering of continuous symmetry .",
    "our central result is that , generically , criticality is ising - like , _ i.e. _ the critical exponents calculated for a scalar field model @xcite still hold for a vector field . by tuning a single additional quantity ,",
    "however , a fully symmetric fixed point can be reached , to which @xmath318-like exponents are associated .",

    "indeed , a non - vanishing temperature will in general displace the critial point in parameter space .",
    "if , in the @xmath132 limit , thermal fluctuations allow the system to equilibrate for each value of the exterior magnetic field , the magnetization history is non - hysteretic , regardless of the amount of disorder .",
    "( if @xmath337 is non - vanishing , the lag in the response rounds off the crititcal point , leading to a finite dynamic susceptibility . )",
    "the absence of hysteresis clearly does not modify the predictions of the exponents in the scalar case . in the case of a multicomponent field , however , the scalar and transverse criticalities would not be at experimental reach , enforcing @xmath0-like exponents .    to be more accurate , the spins not only follow their local minima , but also precess .",
    "however , since @xmath5 can be increased arbitrarily slowly , the precession time scale can be separated as much as we want from the `` @xmath338 '' time scale .",
    "then , considering the motion on an intermediate time scale , we find that the precession averages out , and we are effectively left with the above langevin equation .",
    "the path integral is defined as the limit of a time - discretized formulation . in the simplest ( ito ) discretization scheme in which the response to a force at time @xmath129 occurs at time @xmath339 , the jacobian is clearly independent of the spin field @xmath82 . in this case , the contraction of @xmath95 and @xmath82 ( response function ) vanishes at equal time .",

    "<S> earlier work on dynamical critical phenomena in the context of magnetic hysteresis for uniaxial ( scalar ) spins , is extended to the case of a multicomponent ( vector ) field . from symmetry arguments and a perturbative renormalization group approach ( in the path integral formalism ) </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the generic behavior at long time and length scales is described by the scalar fixed point ( reached for a given value of the magnetic field and of the quenched disorder ) , with the corresponding ising - like exponents . by tuning an additional parameter , </S>",
    "<S> however , a fully rotationally invariant fixed point can be reached , at which all components become critical simultaneously , with @xmath0-like exponents . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the possibility of a spontaneous non - equilibrium transverse ordering , controlled by a distinct fixed point , is unveiled and the associated exponents calculated . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to these central results , a didactic `` derivation '' of the equations of motion for the spin field are given , the scalar model is revisited and treated in a more direct fashion , and some issues pertaining to time dependences and the problem of multiple solutions within the path integral formalism are clarified . </S>"
