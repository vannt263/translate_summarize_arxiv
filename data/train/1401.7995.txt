    "by losing mass at a rate of @xmath7 @xmath6 via its stellar wind , an o star can shed a significant portion of its mass over the course of its lifetime @xcite . not only can this substantially reduce the mass of a core - collapse supernova progenitor , but the wind transfers a significant amount of mass , momentum , and energy to the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "thus , the wind mass - loss rate is an important parameter in the study of both stellar evolution and of the galactic environment . in recent years",
    "there has been increased awareness of large systematic uncertainties in many mass - loss rate diagnostics , primarily due to wind clumping , rendering the actual mass - loss rates of o stars somewhat controversial ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "x - rays provide a potentially good clumping - insensitive mass - loss rate diagnostic via the effect of wind attenuation on x - ray emission line profile shapes . the characteristic line profile shape that provides",
    "the diagnostic power arises because redshifted photons emitted from the rear hemisphere of the wind are subject to more attenuation than the blueshifted photons originating in the front hemisphere ( @xcite ; see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the degree of blue shift and asymmetry in these line profiles is then directly proportional to the wind column density and thus to the mass - loss rate . by fitting a simple quantitative model @xcite to each emission line in a star s spectrum and then analysing the ensemble of line optical depths , we can determine the star s mass - loss rate @xcite .",
    "complementary approaches that fit all the lines simultaneously , along with fitting the broadband x - ray properties , have also been employed recently @xcite .",
    "while our approach does not use as many different observational constraints it does have the advantage of simplicity , which enables us to more easily explore the effects of individual line properties , particularly those involving hot plasma kinematics and absorption by the cold wind component , which are the focus of this paper .    because this x - ray absorption line profile diagnostic scales with the column density rather than the square of the density , it avoids many of the problems presented by traditional mass - loss rate diagnostics",
    ". in particular , uv resonance line diagnostics are problematic due to their sensitivity to ionization corrections which are highly uncertain and are sensitive to clumping effects on density - squared recombination @xcite .",
    "further complications arise with uv lines from optically thick clumping , including velocity - space clumping @xcite . for direct density - squared diagnostics such as @xmath0 and radio or ir free - free emission",
    ", the mass - loss rate will be overestimated if clumping is not accounted for . and",
    "even when clumping is accounted for , there is a degeneracy between the mass - loss rate and the clumping factor , as the quantity derived from these diagnostics is @xmath8 where the clumping factor , @xmath9 .",
    "using the x - ray absorption diagnostic in conjunction with the density - squared emission diagnostics can break this degeneracy and enable us to simultaneously determine the mass - loss rate and the clumping factor .",
    "recent , more sophisticated application of the density - squared emission diagnostics ( @xmath0 , ir and radio free - free ) , assuming a radially dependent clumping factor , has led to a downward revision of empirical mass - loss rates of o stars @xcite .",
    "these lowered mass - loss rates provide a natural explanation for the initially surprising discovery @xcite that x - ray line profiles are not as asymmetric as traditional mass - loss rate estimates had implied .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      + [ tab : vinf ]    there are three stars in the sample for which the data quality is not good enough to draw any meaningful conclusions : hd 206267 , 15 mon , and @xmath10 cma .",
    "these are the three data sets with fewer than 2500 total meg + heg counts , and for none of these stars are there more than three emission lines for which profile fits with even marginal constraints can be determined ( and for none of the stars is there more than one weak line that is not potentially subject to resonance scattering and the associated ambiguity of model interpretation  see the resonance scattering discussion later in this section ) .",
    "we will not discuss these stars further in this paper .",
    "a fourth star , hd 93250 , has only three usable lines , although it has a significantly larger number of counts in its spectrum than the three stars we are excluding .",
    "the small number of strong lines , despite the higher signal - to - noise spectrum , can be understood in the context of the high plasma temperature and correspondingly strong bremsstrahlung continuum and relatively weak lines . as we discuss in the next section , this is a strong indication that the x - ray spectrum of hd 93250 is dominated by hard x - ray emission from colliding wind shocks in the context of the binary wind - wind interaction mechanism .",
    "we summarize the fitted @xmath11 and @xmath12 values , and their uncertainties , in figs .",
    "[ fig : taustar ] and [ fig : ro ] , respectively , with overall results for each star presented in table [ tab : results ] . in the two figures , each point represents the fit to a single line or blended line complex . in fig .",
    "[ fig : taustar ] we convert each line s fitted @xmath11 value to a mass - loss rate using equation ( [ eqn : taustar ] ) and the wavelength - dependent opacity ( the standard , solar - abundance - based model ) shown in fig.[fig : opacity ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : taustar ] we also show the best - fitting mass - loss rate we derive from fitting the ensemble of @xmath11 values along with the theoretical mass - loss rate @xcite listed in table [ tab : results ] .",
    "we show all 12 sample stars ( excluding the three low - count stars mentioned above but including hd 93129a and @xmath4  pup ) in these figures , even though , as we will discuss in the next section , we discount the interpretation of these results in terms of a wind mass - loss rate for some of the stars .",
    "all 12 of the mass - loss rate fits are formally good , with @xmath13 per showing the most scatter and largest reduced @xmath14 , but not large enough for the mass - loss rate fit to be formally rejected .    among the complications of the line profile",
    "fitting is the effect of resonance scattering in optically thick x - ray lines .",
    "@xcite showed that this effect is significant for oxygen and nitrogen lines in the _ xmm - newton _ spectrum of @xmath4  pup .",
    "and those authors presented a ranking of the sobolev optical depths expected for many strong lines in the _ chandra _ bandpass . in our sample stars ,",
    "the lines most likely to be affected by resonance scattering are fe xvii at 15.014  , o viii @xmath15 at 18.969  , and the resonance line at 21.602  in the o xvii @xmath16 complex . for the spectrum of @xmath17 ori , where resonance scattering seems to be important ( see  5.1.10 ) , we refit several of the lines , including these three , allowing the sobolev optical depth to be a free parameter and the velocity law parameter @xmath18 of the hot plasma to be either @xmath19 or 1 @xcite . unfortunately , with those additional free parameters of the model , the values of the parameters we are interested in  @xmath11 and @xmath12  were nearly unconstrained . to account for the possible effects of resonance scattering , then , we eliminated the affected lines from the mass - loss rate determination .",
    "these include all three lines mentioned above for @xmath17 ori and also the o viii @xmath15 line and the o vii @xmath16 resonance line for @xmath4 ori .",
    "note that in both cases , we were able to include the o vii intercombination line at 21.804  , which is not optically thick to resonance scattering , while excluding the nearby resonance line values than do the intercombination lines , which is consistent with the effect of resonance scattering being significant . ] . excluding these lines from the mass - loss rate fits for these two stars led to higher mass - loss rates of a factor of 3 for @xmath17 ori and 50 percent for @xmath4 ori .",
    "for no other star did accounting for resonance scattering make a significant difference for the mass - loss rate determination .",
    "there are a small number of lines for which the fits are only of marginal quality or which provide suspect results .",
    "these include the si xiii complex in @xmath4 ori , for which the fit is not formally good , the line shapes look unusually peaked , and the formal upper limit on @xmath11 is remarkably small .",
    "other suspect fits include a few of the ne ix complexes , which are probably affected by blending with numerous iron lines . for @xmath20",
    "ori , there is some indication that the lines are mildly red - shifted ( rather than showing the expected net blue shift due to wind absorption ) .",
    "this is likely due to binary orbital motion of the primary .",
    "the results we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : taustar ] and [ fig : ro ] include a redshift ( the magnitude of which was allowed to be a free parameter ) in the two longest - wavelength lines for this star .",
    "we discuss this result for @xmath20 ori , and the interpretation of the results for each individual star , in the following section .",
    "we fit an average @xmath12 value for each star based on the ensemble of line - fit results , and we show that average , and its 68 per cent confidence limits , in fig .  [",
    "fig : ro ] .",
    "for many of the stars , a single value provides a good fit , but for hd 150136 , @xmath21 ori , @xmath20 ori , @xmath4 ori , and @xmath17 ori the fits are marginal ( rejected at @xmath22 per cent confidence ) . for the latter two stars , at least , there is a modest correlation between @xmath12 and wavelength .",
    "these overall results , of a basically uniform onset radius of @xmath23 @xmath3 , with possibly somewhat higher values for the longest wavelength lines , are , we note , true for the he - like complexes as well as the other lines , which do not have any particular radial line ratio sensitivity .",
    "this is in contrast to gaussian line profile fits to the same helium - like complexes in many of these same stars which assume a single formation radius for each line complex , and which show a much wider variation in x - ray source location based on the forbidden - to - intercombination line ratio values @xcite .",
    "those results seem to be an artefact of the overly simplistic assumption that all the x - rays form at a single radius .",
    "finally , for a few lines in some of the sample stars spectra , we treat the wind terminal velocity , @xmath24 , as a free parameter ( as described in ",
    "[ subsec : fitting_procedure ] ) .",
    "these results are shown in fig .  6 and listed in table [ tab : vinf ] .",
    "for all the stars with ews emission , we fit a single @xmath24 value to the ensemble of line results , and in each case the fit is formally good and consistent with the bulk wind terminal velocity at the 95 per cent ( 2 @xmath25 ) confidence level .",
    "while the empirical line profile model provides good fits to nearly all the lines in all the sample stars , one of the primary results of this study is the overall weakness  or even absence  of wind absorption signatures in the _ chandra _ grating spectra of o stars .",
    "this has been noted before by various authors examining individual objects , generally via fitting gaussian profile models ( e.g.@xcite ) , but here we have systematically quantified this result using a more physically meaningful line profile model .",
    "there are three classes of explanations for the weak wind - absorption signatures we measure , and the associated low mass - loss rates : ( 1 ) the line profile model is missing some crucial physics ; ( 2 ) processes other than embedded wind shocks are contributing to the x - ray line emission and thereby diluting the characteristic shifted and skewed profiles that are the signature of wind absorption ; and ( 3 ) the actual mass - loss rates of these stars are lower than expected from theory and from older empirical determinations made from @xmath0 , uv , or radio / ir data that ignore wind clumping .",
    "examining the trends shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : taustar ] and [ fig : ro ] , we can identify several stars with extremely low wind optical depths and/or shock onset radii that deviate significantly from the expectations of the ews scenario .",
    "these include hd 93250 , hd 150136 , @xmath21 ori , @xmath4 oph , and @xmath20 ori . as we show below , it is likely that most of these stars , and also cyg ob2 8a , have a significant contribution from cws in their observed x - ray line profiles .",
    "the other stars in the sample : 9 sgr , @xmath13 per , @xmath4 ori , and @xmath17 ori ( as well as hd 93129a and @xmath4  pup ) have line profiles that are consistent with the expectations of the ews scenario , with @xmath11 values that , while low , are well within an order of magnitude of the theoretically expected values and are consistent with the expected wavelength trend of the atomic opacity of their winds .",
    "we note that @xmath20 ori is a borderline case .",
    "the mass - loss rates we derive for these stars from their ensembles of @xmath11 values are listed in table [ tab : results ] and are all lower than the theoretical values computed by @xcite .",
    "we summarize the x - ray - derived mass - loss rates for all the stars in the sample ( even those for which the derived values can not be trusted ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : xray_vs_vink ] , and compare these mass - loss rates to the theoretical values .",
    "we will discuss the results shown in this figure further , but first let us consider each star in our sample with an eye towards differentiating among the three scenarios outlined above for explaining the weaker - than - expected line profile wind absorption signatures .",
    "fits to the small number of lines in this very early o supergiant s _ chandra _ grating spectrum have already been presented @xcite , and here we rederive the mass - loss rate from the previously fitted @xmath11 values using the standard , solar abundance wind opacity model we described in  3.3 .",
    "we find the same mass - loss rate reported by @xcite , who used a wind opacity model with altered cno abundances .",
    "as noted in that paper , this star has an early - type visual companion at a separation of roughly 50 mas detected with the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "fine guidance sensor @xcite .",
    "but at that separation any colliding wind x - ray emission is negligible compared to the observed ews x - ray emission @xcite .",
    "the _ chandra _ grating spectrum of this early o main sequence star is quite hard and bremsstrahlung dominated , indicating that the spectral hardness is due to high plasma temperatures rather than being a by - product of wind and/or ism absorption .",
    "hd 93250 was identified as being anomalous in x - rays in the recent chandra carina complex project @xcite , with an x - ray luminosity even higher than that of hd 93129a , and a high x - ray temperature derived from low - spectral - resolution _ chandra _ acis data @xcite .",
    "those authors suggest that the x - rays in hd 93250 are dominated by colliding wind shocks from interactions with an assumed binary companion having an orbital period greater than 30 d. soon after the publication of that paper , @xcite announced an interferometric detection of a binary companion at a separation of 1.5 mas , corresponding to 3.5 au .",
    "thus it seems that the hard and strong x - ray spectrum and the symmetric and unshifted x - ray emission lines can be readily explained in the context of cws x - ray emission .",
    "this star is known to be a spectroscopic binary with a massive companion in an 8 or 9 yr orbit @xcite .",
    "the x - ray properties of 9 sgr were described by @xcite based on _ xmm - newton _ observations .",
    "these authors noted blue - shifted line profiles , based on gaussian fits , and also a somewhat higher than the normal @xmath26 ratio and a moderate amount of hot ( @xmath27 mk ) plasma based on fits to the _ xmm - newton _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic ) spectrum , although only about 1 per cent of the x - ray emission measure is due to the hot component . a simple cws model computed by @xcite shows that the observed x - ray emission levels can not be explained by colliding wind shocks , and",
    "the authors conclude that the x - ray emission is dominated by embedded wind shocks .",
    "presumably the separation of the components and/or their relative wind momenta are not optimal for producing cws x - ray emission .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that while there may be a small amount of contamination from cws x - rays , the line profiles we measure in the _ chandra _ grating spectra are dominated by the ews mechanism , and therefore the mass - loss rate we derive from the profile fitting is indeed a good approximation to the true mass - loss rate .",
    "we note , also , that according to the radial velocity curve shown in @xcite the _ chandra _ grating spectrum we analyse in this paper was taken during a phase of the orbit when the primary s radial velocity was close to zero . and finally , we note that the published value of the wind parameter @xmath28 gives @xmath29 @xcite , which is somewhat lower than the value we find here , using the standard @xmath30 .      as with hd 93129a , we refit the mass - loss rate from the previously published ensemble of @xmath11 values @xcite . in this case , though , we find a mass - loss rate that differs from the published value due to our use of a solar abundance wind opacity model in this paper . we find a mass - loss rate of @xmath31 @xmath6 ( and find the same value when we used our altered cno wind opacity model , shown as the dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : opacity ] ) .",
    "this is nearly a factor of two below the value found by @xcite because their wind opacity was based on empirical c , n , and o abundance determinations that had a net metallicity of about half solar .",
    "all of the change in our new , lower mass - loss rate is due to our use of a wind opacity model that assumes solar metallicity .      a well - known spectroscopic binary , with a period of only 2.662 d @xcite , and a third o star in the system at a somewhat larger separation @xcite , the hd 150136 system has previously been studied in the x - ray using the same data we reanalyse here @xcite .",
    "those authors find a very high x - ray luminosity but a soft spectrum with broad x - ray emission lines .",
    "they also detect some short period x - ray variability that they tentatively attribute to an occultation effect .",
    "a more recent determination of the ephemeris @xcite is consistent with an occultation effect causing the observed x - ray variability @xcite .",
    "and although colliding wind binaries with strong x - ray emission are generally thought to produce hard x - ray emission , it has recently been shown that many massive o+o binaries have relatively soft emission and modest x - ray luminosities , especially if their orbital periods are short @xcite .",
    "we also note that this star s x - ray emission stands out from the other giants and supergiants in the x - ray spectral morphology study of @xcite by virtue of its high h - like / he - like silicon line ratio , indicating the presence of some hotter plasma .",
    "we conclude that although a few of the x - ray emission lines measured in this star s spectrum have non - zero @xmath11 values , overall the lines are too heavily contaminated by x - rays from colliding wind shocks to be used as a reliable mass - loss rate indicator .",
    "with phase - locked x - ray variability , a high @xmath26 , and a significant amount of hot plasma with temperatures above 20 mk @xcite , cyg ob2 8a has x - ray properties characteristic of colliding wind shocks .",
    "it is a spectroscopic binary with a 21 d period in an eccentric orbit , and a semi - major axis of 0.3 au .",
    "the small number of short - wavelength lines we are able to fit are not terribly inconsistent with the expectations of the embedded wind shock scenario , although the inferred mass - loss rate is roughly an order of magnitude lower than the theoretically expected value .",
    "however , because they are only present at short wavelengths , where the wind opacity is low , they do not provide very much leverage on the mass - loss rate , and , with their large error bars , they are also generally consistent with @xmath32 ( although the mg xii @xmath15 line has @xmath33 ) .",
    "we included this star in our sample because of a prior analysis of the same _ chandra _ grating data under the assumption of ews emission from a single star @xcite , but given the thorough analysis by @xcite , we must conclude that the x - rays are dominated by colliding wind shocks , at least to a large extent , and that the profile fits we present here do not provide much information about embedded wind shocks or the wind mass - loss rate .      a runaway star without a close binary companion and with a constant radial velocity @xcite , @xmath13 per should not have any binary colliding wind shock emission contaminating the x - ray emission lines we analyse .",
    "it does , however , show significant uv and @xmath0 variability , at least some of which is rotationally - modulated @xcite .",
    "thus the assumptions of spherical symmetry and a wind that is smooth on large scales are violated to some extent .",
    "still , the x - ray line profiles should provide a relatively reliable mass - loss rate .",
    "the @xmath11 values we find are significantly larger than zero and are consistent with the expected wavelength trend .",
    "the mass - loss rate we derive is a factor of 4 or 5 below the theoretical value from @xcite .",
    "of all the stars in the sample , @xmath21 ori shows the least amount of line asymmetry and blue shift , with all seven lines and line complexes we analyse having @xmath11 values consistent with zero . taken at face value ,",
    "the derived mass - loss rate is three orders of magnitude below the theoretical value .",
    "the star is in a multiple system , with the closest component a spectroscopic binary in a highly eccentric , 29 d orbit @xcite .",
    "observations were made at a time when the stars radial velocities were very close to zero .",
    "although there are no definitive signatures of cws x - ray emission ( such as orbital modulation of the x - rays ) , it is very likely that the quite broad but symmetric emission lines we have measured are from colliding , rather than embedded , wind shocks .",
    "this star also has a nearly complete lack of wind absorption signatures in its line profiles . and its lines are narrower than expected in the ews scenario , as shown by the low @xmath12 values in fig .  [",
    "fig : ro ] . unlike the other stars in the sample with x - ray profiles that are difficult to understand in the context of embedded wind shocks , @xmath4 ori does not have a binary companion likely to produce colliding wind shock x - rays .",
    "it is , however , a very rapid rotator ( @xmath34 km s@xmath35 ; @xcite ) , goes through @xmath0 emission episodes that qualify it as an oe star @xcite , and has an equatorially concentrated wind @xcite .",
    "the wind s deviation from spherical symmetry could explain the relatively symmetric and narrow x - ray emission lines .",
    "the wind is likely truly weak as well @xcite , and so our measurements can place a 1 @xmath25 upper limit on the mass - loss rate that is a factor of 40 below the theoretically predicted value @xcite , if the wind s deviation from spherical symmetry is not important for the x - ray emission .",
    "this low mass - loss rate is in fact consistent with those found by @xcite .",
    "the x - rays allow for even lower mass - loss rates , too , but not higher ones .      with a quite small amount of wind attenuation evident in its line profiles and narrower than expected lines ,",
    "the results from @xmath20 ori are also suspect , although there are some emission lines with non - zero @xmath11 values in its _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "this star is a member of a multiple system that includes an eclipsing , spectroscopic binary companion with an orbital period of 5.7 d. the companion is an early b star , and an earlier analysis of these same _ chandra _ data indicated that colliding wind shocks were not likely to be strong enough to account for the x - ray luminosity of @xmath36 erg s@xmath35 @xcite .",
    "however , it seems likely that between occultation effects and modest wind - wind interaction with the known companion that there is some degree of contamination of the wind absorption signal in the context of our basic , spherically symmetric single - star emission line model .",
    "preliminary analysis of a new , long , phase - resolved _ chandra _ observation does indeed indicate some possible effects of the companion star on the x - ray line profiles @xcite . as far as the mass - loss rate",
    "is concerned , we can only be quantitative to the extent that we can say that if all of the x - ray emission comes from embedded wind shocks in the spherically symmetric wind of the primary , then the mass - loss rate of @xmath20 ori is an order of magnitude below the @xcite mass - loss rate .",
    "significant wind absorption signatures are seen in the x - ray profiles of @xmath4 ori ( as demonstrated in @xcite ) , which has the highest signal - to - noise _ chandra _ spectrum of any of the stars in our sample .",
    "the expected wavelength trend is seen in the @xmath11 results , especially after the o @xmath15 and @xmath16 lines are excluded due to resonance scattering .",
    "the fitted @xmath12 values are consistent with @xmath37 @xmath3 , expected in the ews scenario . while it is possible that there could be some contamination from cws x - ray emission , the binary companion of @xmath4 ori is two magnitudes fainter than the primary and is at a separation of about 100 @xmath3 , making strong cws emission an unlikely scenario @xcite .",
    "a more distant companion is resolved in _",
    "chandra _ images and contaminates the _ chandra _ grating spectra at a level of about 10 per cent .      the only b star in our sample , @xmath17 ori is a b0ia mk standard , and given its evolved state and high luminosity , its wind is as strong as many of the o stars in our sample .",
    "nearly all of the x - ray emission lines show wind signatures with @xmath11 values that deviate significantly from zero .",
    "it is also the only star in our sample for which eliminating the lines most likely subject to resonance scattering has a very significant effect on our derived mass - loss rate , increasing it from @xmath38 to @xmath39 @xmath6 . eliminating those lines",
    "also significantly improves the quality of the fit . and",
    "the low wind terminal velocity of @xmath17 ori makes resonance scattering sobolev optical depths larger , all things being equal , so the importance of the effect here , but not apparently in most of the other stars , is reasonable .",
    "thus , we report the higher mass - loss rate in table [ tab : results ] and show the fit from which that value is derived in fig[fig : taustar ] .",
    "there is no reason to believe that cws x - ray emission affects the star s _ chandra _ spectrum .",
    "its only known companion is at 3 arcmin @xcite ( which would be easily resolved by _ chandra _ ) but is not seen in the _ chandra _ data , while interferometric observations show no binary companion down to small separations @xcite .      before discussing the mass - loss rates and ews properties of the sample stars",
    ", we must note that a not insignificant fraction of the sample seems to be contaminated by binary colliding wind x - ray emission .",
    "stars like cyg ob 8a show characteristic time - variable , hard x - ray emission .",
    "but other stars , like @xmath21 ori and hd 150136 show x - ray emission that is not obviously orbitally modulated or very hard ( with hd 93250 being something of an intermediate case ) .",
    "all four of these stars have known o star binary companions at relatively small separations , and thus we can attribute the bulk of their x - ray line emission to the cws mechanism and therefore we can not infer a wind mass - loss rate nor any ews shock properties from their x - ray line profiles . while idealized cws models predict distinctive x - ray emission line profile shapes @xcite , such shapes are not observed in real systems ( e.g.  @xcite ) , perhaps because of shock instabilities and the associated mixing and large random velocity components of the x - ray emitting plasma @xcite .",
    "therefore , when a mixture of cws and ews x - rays is present , the observed , hybrid line profiles should be relatively symmetric and moderately broad , mimicking pure ews profiles with little or no absorption . and",
    "as we have already mentioned , binary cws x - ray emission does not necessarily have to be hard or at significantly elevated levels , depending on the binary orbital parameters @xcite .",
    "pup and hd 93129a ) compared to the theoretically expected mass - loss rates @xcite .",
    "stars dominated by ews are shown as filled circles , while those where our line profile model breaks down , in most cases due to cws x - rays , are shown as open squares .",
    "the dashed line indicates the region where both mass - loss rate estimates are equal .",
    ", width=340 ]    in addition , the x - ray line emission from the late o supergiant @xmath20 ori may very well be affected by the presence of an early - b close binary companion , which at the very least should break the spherical symmetry of the primary s wind . as we show from the profile fitting and",
    "discuss in the last subsection , there is some evidence of ews signatures in the profiles of this star , and so it is most likely a hybrid case , and thus the profile fitting provides a lower limit on the mass - loss rate , assuming that ews emission is the dominant contribution , and that limit is a factor of 12 below the theoretically expected value @xcite .",
    "thus @xmath20 ori and the four sample stars discussed in the previous paragraph  the five stars denoted by open symbols in fig .  [ fig : xray_vs_vink ]  fall to one extent or another into categories ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) discussed at the beginning of this section ; their x - ray emission is not well described by physics assumptions such as spherical symmetry or it is not dominated by the ews mechanism .    for the other seven stars ",
    "indicated by filled symbols in fig.[fig : xray_vs_vink ]  it is unlikely that a non - ews mechanism is significantly affecting the x - ray line emission and so we can interpret their small to modest wind absorption signatures in terms of low , but measurable , wind mass - loss rates .",
    "the systematically low values of these mass - loss rates compared to the theoretically predicted values is the main result of this study , but the @xmath11 values we fit for the ensemble of x - ray emission lines from these stars are indeed consistent with the wavelength trend expected from the atomic opacity of their winds . and the low mass - loss rate values we find are themselves consistent with other recent multi - wavelength wind studies @xcite that find mass - loss rates a factor of a few lower than those predicted by @xcite . the most luminous , earliest star in our sample , hd 93129a ( o2 if * ) has an x - ray mass - loss rate a factor of 2 below the @xcite theoretical value , while @xmath4  pup , 9 sgr , @xmath4 ori , and @xmath13 per have x - ray mass - loss rates a factor of 3 to 6 lower than the theoretically predicted values .",
    "the early b supergiant @xmath17 ori shows similar results , but when we exclude the emission lines that might be affected by resonance scattering the resulting higher mass - loss rate is only a factor of 2 below the theoretical value .",
    "the average mass - loss rate reduction with respect to the theoretical values is a factor of 3 for these six stars . finally , the least luminous star in our sample , @xmath4 oph , has essentially no wind signatures in its _ chandra _ emission lines , and although to some extent this may be due to rapid rotation and associated asphericity , the x - ray mass - loss rate we derive of only a few @xmath40 @xmath6 is consistent with other recent determinations of the mass - loss rate of this weak - wind star @xcite .",
    "the mass - loss rate measurements we present here , based on wind absorption , are important because they are not subject to the density - squared clumping effects that make the traditional mass - loss rate diagnostics problematic . but with these x - ray",
    "mass - loss rates in hand , we can use the density - squared diagnostics to measure the clumping factor in the diagnostic formation region , via @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the mass - loss rate derived from @xmath0 , ir , or radio under the assumption of a smooth wind . in practice , it is more reliable to model the density - squared diagnostics using the x - ray derived mass - loss rate and varying the clumping factor , @xmath43 and the clump onset radius , @xmath44 . of course , the clumping factor may vary with location in the wind . for the o stars in our sample",
    "the @xmath0 is formed mainly in the inner wind , whereas radio emission originates at much larger radii and thus probes the conditions in the outer wind @xcite .",
    "profile of @xmath13 per ( solid , black ) is well - fitted by a wind model that has the low , x - ray derived mass - loss rate , of @xmath45 @xmath6 , and @xmath46 with a clumping onset , @xmath44 , just above the photosphere ( dash - dot , blue ) .",
    "neither an unclumped model ( dotted , red ) nor a model with @xmath47 but a clumping onset of @xmath48 @xmath3 ( dashed , green ) fits the data.,width=321 ]    to demonstrate this technique , we fit the @xmath0 line ( mean profile ) measured in one sample star , @xmath13 per , accounting for optically thin clumping using the synthesis technique developed by @xcite and @xcite . fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] shows several model profiles computed using our x - ray derived mass - loss rate .",
    "models without clumping or with clumping that starts well above the photosphere fail to produce enough @xmath0 emission , but a model with a clumping factor of @xmath47 and a clumping onset radius immediately above the photosphere does reproduce the observed @xmath0 emission level .",
    "this clumping factor is completely consistent with the smooth - wind @xmath0 mass - loss rate measured by @xcite when using the scaling law in the previous paragraph .",
    "the big difference between the dash - dotted ( blue ) curve and the dashed ( green ) curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] shows that the @xmath0 wind emission in @xmath13 per originates almost entirely in layers just above the photosphere .",
    "a similar result was found for hd 93129a @xcite , where a radially constant clumping factor of @xmath49 with an onset just above the photosphere fits the @xmath0 data along with the x - ray - derived mass - loss rate .",
    "although the profile fitting presented here is , like any diagnostic technique , subject to various systematic effects , we have quantified those effects and find that they are generally on the order of a few tens of per cent .",
    "uncertainties in the wind opacity , which must be modeled in order to derive a mass - loss rate from an ensemble of @xmath11 values , may be the biggest source of error .",
    "but although radial variations within a given wind , and uncertainty about the ionization state and detailed elemental abundances contribute modestly to the systematic errors , the biggest wind opacity uncertainty arises from uncertainty about the overall metallicity of the wind .",
    "the opacity is directly proportional to the metallicity and , indeed , using a solar abundance wind opacity model , as we do in this study , has led us to reduce the mass - loss rate estimate of the canonical o supergiant , @xmath4  pup , from @xmath50 @xmath6 @xcite to @xmath51 @xmath6 .",
    "this value is very close to the newly derived values of @xmath52 @xmath6 from the analysis of hydrogen lines in the near - ir @xcite , and of @xmath53 @xmath6 from an optical and uv analysis @xcite , while the global x - ray modeling of @xcite finds a modestly higher value of @xmath54 @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite also includes our programme star @xmath17 ori , for which those authors find @xmath55 @xmath6 . that value is bracketed by our two values , the higher of which accounts for resonance scattering .    for",
    "the ews sources in our sample , the fits to the x - ray emission lines also provide information about the spatial distribution and kinematics of the shock - heated wind plasma . in general , we find consistency with models in which the bulk wind and the embedded x - ray plasma have the same kinematics , described by the standard beta wind velocity law , with terminal velocities given by optical and uv diagnostics holding for the x - ray plasma as well as the bulk wind .",
    "the shock onset parameter , @xmath12 , is consistent with @xmath23 @xmath3 , or a little less , which is in line with published 1d and 2d numerical simulations of the instability @xcite .",
    "however , recent wind structure simulations that account for both sound - wave driven excitation of the wind instability and limb darkening , do show more structure near the base of the wind , and certainly well below @xmath56 @xmath3 @xcite . but the role of such inner wind structure for the onset of x - ray emission is not yet clear . to reliably predict the x - ray emission from clump - clump collisions , which is likely to be the dominant mode of line deshadowing instability ( ldi)-induced ews x - ray emission @xcite , may require fully 3-d simulations of clump formation .    from a diagnostic perspective",
    ", the @xmath12 parameter is governed to a large extent by the line widths and thus the kinematics of the x - ray plasma .",
    "if x - ray emitting plasma near the wind base actually does exist , but is moving systematically faster than the velocity predicted by the beta law , then our modeling technique would likely overestimate the value of @xmath12 .",
    "it should be kept in mind that there is no intrinsic limitation to the pre - shock flow speed at small radii , as the nature of the ldi is to rapidly accelerate a small fraction of the line - driven wind mass to higher - than - ambient velocities .",
    "another factor to consider is that different lines , sensitive to plasma of different temperatures , may form in different spatial locations ( e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "there is some indication from the @xmath12 results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ro ] that longer wavelength lines , which tend to arise in relatively cooler plasma , form farther out in the wind , and so perhaps some of the shorter wavelength lines , indicative of plasma with temperatures approaching or exceeding @xmath57 k , do form at smaller radii , consistent with the base wind shocks seen in the simulations presented in @xcite .",
    "regardless of the x - ray shock onset constraints , the consistent @xmath0 and x - ray fitting seems to require ",
    "now for @xmath13 per , too , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : halpha ] , in addition to hd 93129a and @xmath4  pup  that clumping begins very close to the photosphere .",
    "it is possible for the ldi to produce clumping without also producing significant x - ray emission if the shocks are not strong enough to heat the wind plasma to more than @xmath58 k. it is also quite possible that the clumping in o stars begins already in the photosphere , perhaps due to the radiation - driven magneto - acoustic instability @xcite .",
    "future simulations will have to address these issues of clump formation and x - ray production in the context of the ldi .",
    "unfortunately , it is unlikely that many more o stars will be observed at high x - ray spectral resolution in the near future , as the x - ray brightest o stars in the sky are all in the current sample , and as we showed , detailed spectral analysis requires several thousand counts in the _ chandra _ gratings .",
    "however , wind absorption of x - rays has an effect on the broad - band x - ray emission in addition to the emission lines , and modeling the global thermal emission spectrum in conjunction with the broad - band wind absorption holds promise for making mass - loss rate measurements @xcite .",
    "in fact , this technique has already been applied to hd 93129a and gives results consistent with the line profile fitting approach we use in this paper @xcite .    in summary , then , the new findings presented in this paper include : ( 1 ) mass - loss rates can be determined from x - ray line profile shapes without having to correct for optically thin clumping ; and ( 2 ) this clumping - insensitive diagnostic finds mass - loss rates that are on average a factor of 3 lower than the theoretical rates of @xcite ; but ( 3 ) in the case of @xmath4 oph , which is a previously determined weak - wind star , the mass - loss rate discrepancy is closer to two orders of magnitude ; ( 4 ) the spatial distribution of the x - ray plasma and its kinematics is roughly consistent with the predictions of numerical simulations of these o star winds ; ( 5 ) clumping that affects @xmath0 begins very close to the photosphere while the x - ray emission onset is farther out in the wind ; and finally ( 6 ) a perhaps surprising number of programme stars seem subject to contamination by cws x - ray emission , even in some cases where the overall x - ray emission is neither unusually strong nor unusually hard .",
