    "gravitational wave bursts are expected to be produced from astrophysical sources such as stellar collapses , the inspirals and mergers of compact binary star systems , the generators of gamma ray bursts , and other energetic phenomena .",
    "upper limits from searches for gravitational wave bursts with resonant bar detectors have recently been reported in @xcite , and results using interferometric detectors are published in  @xcite . a new generation of detectors based on laser interferometry has been constructed , aiming for direct detection with broadband sensitivity .",
    "these include the three ligo detectors @xcite described briefly in section  [ sec : detectors ] , as well as the british - german geo 600 detector @xcite , the japanese tama 300 detector @xcite , and the french - italian virgo detector @xcite , forming a worldwide network . in the summer of 2002",
    ", all three ligo detectors were brought to their design optical configuration .",
    "after a series of engineering runs , the ligo , geo 600 and tama 300 detectors operated in coincident observation mode for the first time ( science run 1 , or s1 ) for two weeks in august - september 2002 .",
    "although the ligo detectors were far from their design sensitivity , the quality of the data was sufficiently high to exercise the first generation of analysis procedures for various types of gravitational wave searches , including searches for chirp gravitational waves from compact neutron - star binary inspirals @xcite , quasi - monochromatic gravitational waves from pulsar j1939 + 2134 @xcite , and broad - band stochastic background gravitational radiation @xcite .",
    "in all these analyses , a well - defined astrophysical model was assumed . in this paper",
    "we report on a search ( using the ligo detectors only ) for unmodeled gravitational wave bursts that might originate from supernovae in our galaxy , mergers of binary stellar - mass systems , gamma ray burst engines , or other energetic sources .",
    "the waveforms of gravitational waves from such sources are poorly known , so we employ data analysis algorithms which can , in principle , identify bursts with a broad range of possible waveforms .",
    "the first detection of gravitational wave bursts requires stable , well understood detectors ; well - tested and robust data processing procedures ; and clearly defined criteria for establishing confidence that no signal is of terrestrial origin .",
    "none of these elements were firmly in place as we began this first ligo science run ; rather , this run provided the opportunity for us to understand our detectors better , exercise and hone our data processing procedures , and build confidence in our ability to establish detection of gravitational wave bursts in future science runs .",
    "therefore , the goal for this analysis is to produce an upper limit on the rate for gravitational wave bursts , even if a purely statistical procedure suggests the presence of a signal above background .",
    "it should also be noted that the sensitivities of the three ligo detectors during s1 were several orders of magnitude worse than required for plausible detection of bursts from astrophysical sources such as supernovae in our milky way galaxy @xcite .    in this search",
    "we focus on short ( 4 ms to 100 ms ) bursts in the ligo sensitivity band ( roughly 150 to 3000 hz ) , with sufficiently high strain amplitude to be observed over the detector noise .",
    "we make no other assumptions about the nature or origin of the burst .",
    "we apply software algorithms to the ligo detector data stream to detect such bursts . in order to suppress false signals from fluctuations of the detector noise we require temporal coincidence of detected burst events in all three ligo detectors .",
    "we estimate the rate of accidental coincidences by studying the number of time - shifted coincident burst events , and look for a statistically significant excess of coincident burst events at zero time shift . in light of the discussion in the previous paragraph ,",
    "our goal for the search presented here is to set an upper limit on the rate of excess coincident bursts , given the detectors level of sensitivity during the s1 run .    in order to interpret our upper limit on the rate of burst events ,",
    "we evaluate the efficiency of our search algorithms for the detection of simulated bursts injected into the data streams , using simple , well - defined waveforms ( gaussians and sine - gaussians ) .",
    "we obtain curves of triple - coincidence detection efficiency as a function of gravitational waveform peak amplitude at the earth , averaged over source direction and incident wave ( linear ) polarization .",
    "we then combine our gravitational wave burst rate limits with these efficiency curves , yielding rate - versus - strength regions that ( for the waveforms that we have examined ) are excluded at the 90%  confidence level or higher .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : detectors ] we briefly describe the ligo detector array and the data obtained from the first science run , with emphasis on those characteristics most relevant for a search for short gravitational wave bursts . in section [ sec : s1 ] we briefly describe the s1 run . in section [ sec : preselection ] we describe the data quality requirements that were applied to the s1 data sample , and present the subset of the data used for this search . in section [ sec : pipeline ] we describe our data processing pipeline , including the event trigger generation , event vetoes , and the time coincidence requirement .",
    "we present the results of two independent pipelines , based on the burst detection algorithms discussed in section  [ sec : etgs ] . in section",
    "[ sec : background ] we estimate the background ( accidental coincidence ) event rate . in section [ sec : efficiency ]",
    "we evaluate the efficiency for the detection of bursts modeled with simple ad hoc waveforms , and compare that with expectations . in section [ sec : results ] we present our limit on the observed excess event rate .",
    "we combine this with our efficiency curves as a function of signal strength , excluding regions in the rate versus signal strength plane .",
    "we also discuss the most significant systematic errors in these measurements .",
    "we summarize these results in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "finally , we outline our plans to improve and expand our search methodology using data from subsequent observation runs .",
    "all three ligo detectors are orthogonal arm michelson laser interferometers .",
    "the ligo hanford observatory operates two identically oriented interferometric detectors which share a common vacuum envelope : one having 4 km long measurement arms ( referred to as h1 ) , and one having 2 km long arms ( h2 ) .",
    "the ligo livingston observatory operates a single 4 km long detector ( l1 ) .",
    "the two observatories are approximately 3000 km apart , corresponding to 10 ms of light travel time .",
    "the detectors are approximately co - aligned , so that a gravitational wave should appear with comparable signals at both sites .",
    "the principles underlying these laser interferometer gravitational wave detectors are discussed in @xcite .",
    "a more detailed description of the ligo detectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "these detectors aim to detect gravitational waves by interferometrically monitoring the relative separation of mirrors which play the role of test masses , responding to space - time distortions induced by the waves as they traverse the detectors .",
    "the effect of a quadrupolar gravitational wave is to produce a strain in space , impinging upon the detector and thus displacing the mirrors at the ends of the arms by an amount proportional to the arm length . for gravitational waves incident from directly overhead or below , and polarized along the arms of the detector , the mirrors at the ends of the two arms experience purely differential motion .",
    "waves incident from non - optimal directions and/or polarizations can also induce differential motion ; the `` antenna pattern '' is discussed in section  [ sec : direction ] .",
    "each interferometer is illuminated with light from a nd : yag laser , operating at 1064 nm  @xcite . before the light",
    "is launched into the interferometer , its frequency , amplitude and direction are all stabilized , using a combination of active and passive stabilization techniques  @xcite .",
    "the light is sent through a beam splitter towards both arms . in each arm , a pair of mirrors ( the `` input test mass '' and `` end test mass '' ) , separated by 2 km or 4 km , form a fabry perot resonant optical cavity with a finesse of approximately 220 . because the michelson interferometer antisymmetric port is held at a dark fringe , and because the fabry - perot cavities are low - loss , most of the light returning from the arms to the beam splitter nominally exits through the symmetric port of the beam splitter back towards the laser .",
    "a `` power recycling '' mirror returns it , resonantly , to the interferometer ( forming a `` power recycling cavity '' ) .",
    "the average length of the arm cavities is used as a frequency reference for the final stage of frequency stabilization  @xcite .",
    "differential arm cavity length changes result in a small amount of light exiting the asymmetric port of the beam splitter ; this constitutes the gravitational wave signal .",
    "the effect of the arm cavities and power recycling is to increase the sensitivity of the interferometer to gravitational wave signals .",
    "the arm lengths and arm cavity finesse are optimized to minimize various noise sources .",
    "the mirrors of the interferometer @xcite are suspended as pendulums @xcite .",
    "active and passive vibration isolation systems @xcite are used to isolate them from seismic noise .",
    "various feedback control systems are used to keep the multiple optical cavities tightly on resonance @xcite and well aligned @xcite , and to keep the michelson interferometer on a dark fringe .",
    "the l1 detector also employed feedforward control to compensate for microseismic disturbances  @xcite .",
    "when all length degrees of freedom are under control and the control systems are operating within their linear regime , the interferometer is said to be `` in lock '' . during the first few minutes following the acquisition of a lock in any individual detector , the instrument typically experiences excess noise due to the ringing down of mechanical resonances in the mirror suspensions that were excited by impulsive forces applied during the lock acquisition procedure . after allowing for these resonances to damp down ,",
    "the detector is placed into `` science mode '' ; the data collected in science mode are available for gravitational wave searches .",
    "science mode continues until the interferometer loses lock or becomes unstable for any reason .",
    "the gravitational wave strain signal ( referred to in this paper as the gravitational wave data channel ) is derived from the error signal of the feedback loop used to control the differential length of the interferometer arms .",
    "a 16 bit analog - to - digital converter is used to digitize the ( uncalibrated ) strain signal at a rate of 16384 hz .    to calibrate the error signal , the response to a known differential arm strain is measured , and the frequency - dependent effect of the feedback loop gain is measured and compensated for . the laser wavelength and the amplitude of the mirror drive signal required to move the interference pattern through a fixed number of fringes",
    "are used to calibrate the absolute scale for strain .",
    "the frequency response of the detector is determined via periodic swept - sine excitations of the end test masses . during detector operation ,",
    "the calibration is tracked by injecting continuous , fixed - amplitude sinusoidal excitations into the end test mass control systems , and monitoring the amplitude of these signals at the measurement ( error ) point .",
    "the calibration procedure , and results , are described in more detail in @xcite .      by the summer of 2002",
    ", all three ligo detectors were operating reasonably stably and with reasonable in - lock duty cycle . as discussed below",
    ", the strain sensitivities of all three detectors were far from their design goals , but were nonetheless sensitive to gravitational wave bursts from energetic events in our galactic neighborhood .",
    "the ligo laboratory decided that it was an appropriate time for the first science run , s1 .",
    "the s1 run consisted of a 408 hour continuous period from august 23 through september 9 of 2002 , during which data were collected from all three ligo interferometric detectors .",
    "the state of each of the detectors and the quality of the data being logged was continuously monitored through automated and manual procedures . as discussed above , in order to be sensitive to gravitational waves , the detectors must be in science mode .",
    "environmental disturbances and various instrumental instabilities make it impossible to maintain lock at all times , reducing the effective observation time of the run . during s1 ,",
    "the science mode duty cycles of the three detectors were 41.7%  for l1 , 57.6%  for h1 , and 73.1%  for h2 .",
    "the burst search reported here makes use of the data when all three detectors were in science mode simultaneously , comprising 95.7 hours , or 23.4%  duty cycle .",
    "the strain sensitivity of the ligo detectors is a strong function of gravitational wave frequency . in this analysis",
    ", we focus on a `` detection band '' of best strain sensitivity , from 150 to 3000 hz .",
    "figure [ fig : strain ] shows amplitude spectra of strain - equivalent noise , typical of the three ligo detectors during the s1 run .",
    "the ligo design strain sensitivity is also indicated for comparison .",
    "the differences among the three spectra reflect differences in the operating parameters and hardware implementations of the three instruments ; they are in various stages of reaching the final design configuration .",
    "all detectors operated during s1 at lower effective laser power levels than the eventual level of 6 w at the interferometer input .",
    "other major differences between the s1 state and the final configuration were partially implemented laser frequency and amplitude stabilization systems and partially implemented alignment control systems . because of these conditions , the strain sensitivities of the three detectors were far from the design sensitivity ( see figure [ fig : strain ] ) .    ) of sine - gaussian bursts for which our analysis pipeline is 50%  efficient , as reported in section [ sec : simulations ] . ]",
    "the data processing pipeline described in section [ sec : pipeline ] makes use of many adjustable parameters that can be tuned to optimize the search effectiveness .",
    "we performed these optimizations on a subset of the s1 data that was reserved exclusively for the purpose , and then not used further in the generation of scientific results .",
    "we called this reserved data set the `` playground '' data set .",
    "it was chosen to be about 10% of the total available triple coincidence data .",
    "the choice of which data to include was made by hand , to include as much variety of data quality as possible .",
    "the same playground data set was used for both the burst search and the search for inspiralling binary neutron stars @xcite .",
    "this tuning procedure is described in section [ sec : pipeline ] .",
    "further , the data processing pipeline analyzed triple - coincidence data in six - minute stretches , for convenience in data handling .",
    "lock stretches that were less than six minutes long , or data in the last @xmath2 minutes of a longer lock stretch , were excluded from further analysis .",
    "after exclusion of the playground data and these lock stretch boundaries , 80.8 hours of triple - coincidence data remain .",
    "much effort has gone into improving the stationarity of the statistical properties of the detector noise , and understanding the noise fluctuations .",
    "however , both the detectors responses , and their noise levels , were far from stationary , largely because the control systems were not yet completely implemented . in order to ensure that the data used for this burst search are of the highest available quality , we excluded locked stretches in which the noise in the gravitational wave channel exceeded a pre - determined threshold .",
    "the band - limited root - mean - square ( blrms ) noise power in the gravitational wave channel was monitored continuously in four bands ( 320  400 hz , 400  600 hz , 600  1600 hz , and 1600  3000 hz ) . whenever the blrms over a six - minute interval for any detector in any of these bands exceeded a threshold of 3 times the 68th percentile level for the entire run ( 10 times for the 320400 hz band ) ,",
    "the data from that six - minute period were excluded from further analysis .",
    "a total of 54.6 hours of triple - coincidence data remains after this `` blrms cut '' . a sufficiently strong gravitational wave burst could trigger the blrms cut and thereby prevent its own detection ; the required amplitude is calculated in section  [ sec : simulations ] .    as discussed in section",
    "[ sec : ligodetectors ] , the response of the detectors to gravitational waves was tracked by injecting sinusoidal calibration excitations into the end test mass control systems .",
    "due to technical difficulties , these calibration lines were not reliable or available during some data taking periods . in order to ensure that all the data used in this search represent observations from detectors with well - understood response , data that show no , or anomalously low",
    ", calibration lines were excluded from further analysis ( the `` calibration cut '' ) , leaving 35.5 hours of triple - coincidence data remaining .",
    "this is the final data sample used to search for gravitational wave bursts .",
    "in the analysis presented here , the purpose of the data processing pipeline is to identify candidate gravitational wave events in the data from all three detectors in coincidence . in this section ,",
    "we discuss the procedures and algorithms used to identify coincident burst event candidates , the tuning of the most important parameters , and the procedures used to estimate the accidental coincident burst event rate . the entire analysis procedure ,",
    "parameter tuning , event property estimation , and all other optimizations were developed using the playground data ( section  [ sec : preselection ] ) , and frozen before applying the analysis to the full s1 data set . in the process of analyzing the full data set , it became clear that many of the procedures and tunings were less than optimal , for a variety of reasons .",
    "we present the results of this first analysis in this paper , and intend to apply improved methods and optimizations ( see section [ sec : future ] ) to the analysis of future data sets ( which will have much greater sensitivity to gravitational wave bursts ) .",
    "figure [ fig : pipeline ] shows , in graphical form , the data processing pipeline used in this analysis .",
    "most of the figure is used to schematically illustrate various steps in the pipeline of one of the interferometric detectors ( h1 , l1 , or h2 , generically referred to here as ifo-1 ) .",
    "the analysis pipelines of the other two ifos ( ifo-2 and ifo-3 ) are not shown in detail because they are identical to the first .",
    "the first step in the pipeline ( `` band limited rms &  calibration cuts '' ) validates the strain channel data used in the analysis ; only validated data ( section [ sec : preselection ] ) taken at times when all three detectors were operating simultaneously in science mode are used in this analysis .",
    "this step establishes the accumulated observation time , or livetime , for the analysis .",
    "the next steps in the pipeline ( `` prefiltering &  whitening '' ) take as input the raw gravitational wave channel data from each detector , and prefilter the data stream ( section [ sec : prefiltering ] ) .",
    "the following step ( `` burst event trigger generation '' ) searches for bursts in the filtered data stream using two different burst detection algorithms ( section [ sec : etgs ] ) , resulting in a set of _ event triggers _ at each detector .",
    "all data were processed in non - overlapping segments that were six minutes long .",
    "our pipeline allows for the elimination of event triggers that are coincident in time with anomalous events in auxiliary channels that monitor the detector and the environment ( see `` auxiliary channels '' path and `` single ifo analysis '' gate in fig .  [",
    "fig : pipeline ] ) .",
    "the consideration of these potential vetoes will be described in section [ sec : vetoes ] .",
    "real gravitational wave bursts will cause a nearly simultaneous response in all three detectors , so in the next step we require temporal coincidence of single - detector event triggers ( `` multi - ifo analysis '' block in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipeline ] ) .",
    "we select as `` event candidates '' only those combinations of single - detector event triggers that are consistent with originating from a single plane gravitational wave burst incident on the detector array ( section [ sec : coincidence ] ) .",
    "event triggers from the single - detector steps of our pipeline are mostly due to detector noise .",
    "the independence of noise triggers at the two ligo sites is an important assumption in this analysis .",
    "the largest sources of noise above 100 hz are generated internal to the detectors and are thus uncorrelated .",
    "environmental disturbances can produce bursts of noise that cause triggers , and these can be coincident between the two sites within the @xmath310 ms gravitational wave travel time if they propagate electromagnetically .",
    "auxiliary sensors ( _ e.g. _ , magnetometers ) monitor the environment and their inter - site correlations have been studied .",
    "inter - site disturbances are calculated not to be important until the detectors are close to design sensitivity , and our studies of s1 data have not found evidence for coincident noise bursts even for h1-h2 where the coincident location increases the susceptibility to environmental disturbances . there",
    "does exist some coherence between the gravitational wave channels from the three detectors at certain frequencies  @xcite , but there is no evidence that this contributes to coincident noise bursts .",
    "gravitational wave burst events detected at the two ligo sites will be correlated in time .",
    "we can evaluate the mean rate of background events by measuring the mean rate of events that pass our coincident step after we have artificially shifted in time all the event triggers identified in one of the detectors , for example , l1 .",
    "this background rate estimation is described in section [ sec : background ] .    finally , to determine the efficiency of the data processing pipeline to the detection of strain events incident on the detector array we add simulated events , of varying waveform and amplitude , to the input data stream and measure the fraction identified as event triggers in each detector . knowing the detectors sensitivity to gravitational waves incident from different directions we can combine the results of these simulations to determine the mean efficiency for detection of gravitational wave burst events incident on the detector array .",
    "the efficiency determination is described in section [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "the event trigger generators we employ are designed to process data with a white noise spectrum ( constant power spectral density as a function of frequency ) .",
    "the raw gravitational wave data from all three detectors during s1 are strongly colored , consisting essentially of randomly fluctuating noise with a strongly frequency - dependent power spectrum .",
    "these data can be converted to a noise equivalent strain signal through a response function which is also strongly frequency - dependent , and which is determined through the calibration procedure described in section [ sec : detectors ] .",
    "the noise also contains unwanted features such as spectral lines associated with interference from the 60 hz power mains , mechanical resonances in the detector components , and other imperfections .    for the analysis presented here",
    ", the data from the gravitational wave data channel are passed through a linear filter , consisting of a 6-th order butterworth high - pass filter with 150 hz cut - off frequency to suppress large noise fluctuations which were apparent at lower frequencies , and a whitening filter to flatten the noise spectrum at frequencies above 150 hz . because of the high - pass filtering , we are insensitive to fourier components of a gravitational wave burst below 150 hz . the whitening filters are determined using data taken just prior to the s1 run , and are different for each of the three detectors .",
    "no attempt has been made to incorporate the variation of the noise power with time , or to otherwise optimize the filtering .",
    "further , no attempt has been made to remove spectral lines from the data stream or suppress their effect on the event trigger identification .",
    "it is likely that such pre - processing will be necessary for future , more sensitive searches with ligo data  @xcite .",
    "the impulse response of the prefilter used for this analysis has a strong ringing , extending to 40 ms . as a result of this ringing ,",
    "the event trigger generation algorithms recognize an impulsive event in the strain channel as a cluster of events over a long period of time compared to both the sample rate and the light travel time between the detectors .",
    "this has important consequences for the event trigger time resolution and the time coincidence of event triggers generated in different detectors , as described in section [ sec : coincidence ] below  @xcite .",
    "we use two different techniques to identify event triggers from the prefiltered gravitational wave data channel at each detector .",
    "one technique , which we refer to as , is based on refs .",
    "the second technique , which we refer to as , is described in refs .",
    "@xcite . and",
    "are two different approaches to identifying and selecting infrequent transient events that do not share the statistical characteristics of detector noise and thus might be of gravitational wave origin .",
    "these algorithms are implemented within the ligo data analysis system ( ldas  @xcite ) environment .",
    "the following discussion of the and event trigger generators describes and specifies the parameters that can be adjusted in order to optimize the performance of the algorithms .",
    "some of the parameters can be established without reference to the data , since they effectively determine the response of the algorithm to the duration ( 4 ms to 100 ms ) and frequency band ( 150 to 3000 hz ) characteristics of the bursts that are targeted in this search .",
    "others have been optimized using the playground data defined in section [ sec : preselection ] .",
    "it is assumed that no ( or very few ) real gravitational wave bursts were present in the playground sample .",
    "all parameters were fixed prior to the processing of the full data set , in order to minimize the chance of bias in event trigger generation .",
    "the parameter optimization , especially the choice of thresholds , is guided by competing demands .",
    "lower thresholds on excess power or amplitude variations result in higher rates of event triggers caused by noise fluctuations , but also result in higher sensitivity to gravitational wave bursts . the criterion we adopted consists of minimizing the upper limit for a suite of simulated gravitational wave bursts , described in section [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "this minimization was applied to the playground data set where no triple coincidence event was found after the thresholds were fixed .",
    "this was consistent with a goal of obtaining a total number of accidental coincident triggers of order unity , when extrapolated to the remaining 90%  of the full s1 data set .",
    "nevertheless , the playground data did not adequately represent the full s1 data set , and a variety of additional effects ( including the ringing in the prefiltering , as discussed in section [ sec : prefiltering ] ) resulted in imperfect optimization of the data processing pipeline for both event trigger generators @xcite .",
    "therefore , the resulting number of estimated accidental coincidence events was somewhat larger than one , as discussed in section [ sec : bound ] and table [ tbl : s1raw ] .",
    "[ [ sec : slope ] ]    the algorithm identifies candidate gravitational wave bursts via a threshold on the output of a linear filter applied to the prefiltered gravitational wave data in the time domain . we choose a filter that is essentially a differentiator ( in time ) , and trigger on a slope in the data stream which is ( statistically ) inconsistent with expectations from white gaussian noise .",
    "the algorithm is most sensitive when the detector noise in the strain channel is whitened .",
    "the parameters of the filter have been tuned so that its highest sensitivity is for bursts in which the signal amplitude is increasing linearly with time for ten data samples ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "the response of the filter to sine waves rises with frequency from zero at dc , reaching its first and highest maximum at 1.1 khz .",
    "above this frequency , the response of the filter falls off , passing through several zeros and secondary maxima .",
    "its 3 db bandwidth is about 1.4 khz  @xcite .",
    "the filter output is searched for extrema indicating the presence of bursts .",
    "the peak search algorithm compares each successive filter output value with a threshold . if a filter output value is found to exceed the threshold , then that point and some number of output filter value after the first point exceeding the threshold are further analyzed . for the analysis considered here ,",
    "49 output filter values including the point that passed threshold are examined , a time interval of 3.0 ms .",
    "the output filter value having the highest value in this time interval generates a single trigger .",
    "the amplitude of the trigger and time of the trigger are written to a trigger database .",
    "for this analysis , the threshold was fixed and did not adapt to changing noise levels  @xcite .",
    "[ [ sec : tfclusters ] ]    the event trigger generator is a detection algorithm which identifies connected regions ( _ clusters _ ) in a time - frequency plane where the power is not consistent with the expectations for stationary , colored gaussian noise .",
    "the algorithm is described in detail in @xcite , and various aspects of its implementation for real data are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the implementation of used for our analysis is described below .    the data from a six minute long segment are first prefiltered as described in section [ sec : prefiltering ] .",
    "a time - frequency spectrogram is constructed from 2880 periodograms calculated from 125 ms long non - overlapping subsegments of the six minute long segment  @xcite .    a first level of threshold is applied to the spectrogram , resulting in a high - contrast pixelization .",
    "2880 different measurements of the power are available for every frequency band of the spectrogram .",
    "processing one frequency band at a time , the power measurements are fit with a rice distribution  @xcite . given this fit to the data , the rice distribution is integrated from a power @xmath5 to infinity , and @xmath5 is varied until the integral is equal to a certain pre - defined fraction @xmath6 .",
    "all the pixels of the spectrogram with power larger than @xmath5 are then labeled as _ black pixels _ , while pixels below the threshold are labeled as white pixels .",
    "the procedure was repeated for all the frequency bins in the spectrogram .",
    "the number @xmath6 is called the _ black pixel probability _ : in the absence of signals , any pixel in the spectrogram has , to a good approximation , an equal and independent probability @xmath6 of being black , in each frequency band .",
    "because of this procedure , the effective threshold for black pixels varies in response to changing detector noise levels ; the threshold is `` adaptive '' , as opposed to the fixed threshold employed in the slope algorithm .",
    "the black pixels are then clustered , to look for bursts of excess power in a limited region of the time - frequency plane .",
    "two levels of clustering are used by , based on a study of simulated bursts with varying waveforms .",
    "first , a cluster is defined as the set of all black pixels which has at least one black nearest neighbor ( i.e. , was touching a black pixel by an `` edge '' ) in the set .",
    "all clusters containing at least five pixels are declared significant in this analysis .",
    "second , clusters which are not significant according to the latter criterion are paired together .",
    "if the clusters in a pair are closer to each other in the time - frequency plane than a certain distance threshold , the pair of clusters is declared significant .",
    "clusters satisfying the first clustering condition on the raw size of a cluster are counted as event triggers . for clusters satisfying the second clustering condition , _",
    "generalized _ clusters are formed by linking all the clusters which satisfy the distance thresholds , and these generalized clusters are counted as event triggers . for each event trigger , the time and frequency intervals over which the cluster extends , the total amount of power in the cluster , and the number of pixels it contains , are stored in a database .",
    "the total power in each cluster is a measure of the signal - to - noise ratio for the burst event .",
    "it is calculated without reference to the response of the detector to gravational wave bursts , so its relationship to the strength of the burst depends on the detector and frequency band .",
    "the black pixel probability @xmath6 is tuned as described above .",
    "the values are different for the three different detectors and vary from 0.02 to 0.05 . the total power in the cluster is required to exceed a pre - determined threshold in post - processing ;",
    "this is effectively a cut on the signal - to - noise ratio for the burst event .",
    "the threshold on the power is the same for all three detectors , in order to obtain rates for false ( noise ) triggers which are roughly the same for all three detectors .",
    "[ fig : slopehist ] and [ fig : tfchist ] show histograms of and event triggers before and after the application of the blrms and calibration cuts described in section [ sec : preselection ] .",
    "the horizontal axis in these histograms is a measure of the amplitude or power of the excess signal identified by the or algorithms , respectively .",
    "these measures are indeed proportional to the true amplitude or power of a detected gravitational wave burst , as demonstrated in section [ sec : efficiency ] .",
    "however , no information about the detectors calibrated response functions is used in forming these measures , so the proportionality constant is different for different waveforms , detectors , and data epochs ( and is taken into account in the evaluation of the detection efficiency , section [ sec : efficiency ] ) .",
    "the lower limits on the horizontal axis in these histograms correspond to the threshold applied to that event trigger for input into the next step in the data processing pipeline ( triple coincidence ) .",
    "environmental disturbances and detector instabilities could also produce event triggers .",
    "we collect data in a large number of auxiliary channels which monitor the detector and the environment , in order to look for time - coincident bursts and thus form vetoes for such false triggers .",
    "our pipeline has the capability to search for such bursts in auxiliary channels , and veto an event trigger if it is time - coincident with such a burst .",
    "engineering runs performed prior to the s1 run indicated that such vetoes could be very efficacious , reducing the rate of false event triggers with minimal loss of livetime , due to clearly identifiable instabilities in the detectors . however , once these instabilities were identified , they were eliminated through improved instrumentation , resulting in much improved stability during s1 .",
    "after careful study , no vetoing criteria using auxiliary interferometer and physical environment monitor channels are found to be especially efficacious in the s1 data , for this burst search .",
    "the most promising vetoing channels in the s1 data are interferometer sensors that are closely related to the gravitational wave channel . while we investigated a number of such channels and methods for identifying veto criteria , in the end we concluded that further study was needed before any of these",
    "could safely be used to exclude data from analysis .",
    "further , employing the identified vetoes would have made a negligible difference in the results of this analysis .",
    "thus , in this analysis , we apply no vetoes based on auxiliary channels .",
    "the final stage of our data processing pipeline brings together the event triggers generated by a particular event trigger generator ( either or ) and assembles a smaller list of coincident event trigger triplets .",
    "each triplet consists of an event trigger from each detector that occur within an interval consistent with their origin in a single gravitational wave burst .",
    "these triplets are the event candidates that form the basis for our determination of bounds on the rate of gravitational wave bursts incident on the earth .",
    "temporal coincidence is the most obvious application of coincidence for selection of gravitational wave events and exclusion of noise events .",
    "the ligo detectors are approximately co - aligned and co - planar . as a result , they all sense approximately the same polarization of any incident gravitational wave .",
    "correspondingly , all estimated parameters of the burst ( such as strain amplitude and frequency band ) should be , up to uncertainties in the estimation , the same for all three detectors ( after accounting for the differences in the detectors sensitivities ) . in the analysis presented here we require temporal coincidence ( to an appropriate precision ) for both the and the pipelines .",
    "additionally , events are also characterized by frequency information ; we require consistency between the frequency bands in a coincident triplet ( section  [ sec : freqcut ] ) .",
    "no attempt is made to require coincident event triggers to have consistent amplitudes and waveforms  @xcite .    in the remainder of this section",
    "we describe in greater detail the elements of the data processing pipeline coincidence step .",
    "gravitational waves arrive at the earth as plane waves .",
    "since gravitational waves are assumed to propagate at the speed of light , the interval between event triggers in the different detectors should be no more than the greater of the light propagation time between the detectors and the uncertainty in the arrival time determination of a prototypical burst associated with the event trigger generator .",
    "different timing uncertainties are associated with different event trigger generators .",
    "correspondingly , we use different window durations for and . given a window ,",
    "we compare the start times of the event triggers generated in each of the three detectors .",
    "we form an _ event trigger triplet _ , or triplet for short , from all combinations of h1 , h2 and l1 events whose start times all lie within the window duration .",
    "as described in section [ sec : prefiltering ] the input to the event trigger generators is processed through a high - pass filter that rang strongly . as a result of this ringing ,",
    "impulsive events lead to a train of multiple triggers , with a total duration of approximately 40  ms .",
    "we add 10  ms to this , corresponding to the light travel time between detectors , to determine a 50  ms window for temporal coincidence of events  @xcite .    as described in section [ sec : tfclusters ] , was tuned to a natural time resolution of 125  ms , much larger than the light travel time between the detectors .",
    "on the basis of studies which indicated a larger range of trigger time differences for simulated signals , we expanded this and use a 500  ms window to determine triplets of temporally coincident events  @xcite .",
    "the next step in the multiple - detector coincidence analysis is to _ cluster _ the events from each detector ( this is unrelated to the pixel clustering that forms the heart of the event trigger generation , section  [ sec : tfclusters ] ) . both the and the event trigger generators often associate several event triggers with the same `` burst '' feature . for instance , the ringing of a 1 ms gaussian due to the detector response and the prefiltering of the data ( section  [ sec : prefiltering ] ) can produce several closely spaced event triggers",
    ". often associates multiple triggers with the same broadband event , all with the same start time but different frequency .",
    "since we are interested in the identification of time intervals where `` something unusual '' has happened simultaneously at multiple detectors , we want to cluster these sets of closely spaced events .",
    "clustering takes place only after the time coincidence step .",
    "we require a minimum separation in time between distinct coincident trigger triplets , of 0.5 seconds ; triplets that are separated in time by less than this amount are clustered together into one clustered event triplet ( event candidate ) .",
    "the choice of the clustering window is based on the study of noise triggers and simulated bursts ( section  [ sec : simulations ] ) . in the pipeline ,",
    "0.5 seconds is the width of the coincidence window between triggers from the three detectors . in the pipeline ,",
    "the coincidence window of 50 ms is too small a separation to avoid ambiguities in the definition of clusters and in the event counting , so we use 0.5 seconds for consistency with the pipeline @xcite .",
    "all triggers in the cluster are assumed to originate from one burst event .",
    "guided by simulation studies ( section  [ sec : simulations ] ) , the start time , frequency band , and amplitude or power of the event is taken to be that of the trigger with the largest amplitude or power in the cluster .      for tflusters",
    "we apply one more criterion in the coincidence step of the pipeline .",
    "a triplet of event triggers that arises from a single gravitational wave burst incident on all the detectors should have consistent values for the estimated parameters of the burst .",
    "characterizes each burst event trigger by its bandwidth : the low and high frequency bound @xmath7 of the cluster identified in the time - frequency plane .",
    "when multiple triggers from one detector are clustered in time as described in section [ sec : clustering ] above , the inclusive frequency band for that clustered event trigger is formed . for triggers",
    "only , we require that the frequency bands of the clustered event triggers from each detector in the triplet either overlap , or are separated in frequency space by no more than a fixed window of @xmath8 hz , based on studies of the simulations described in section  [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "the data processing pipeline ( section  [ sec : pipeline ] ) generates background event triggers originating in noise level fluctuations in the detectors , due to random processes or environmental or instrumental disturbances .",
    "our primary means to reject such background event triggers is temporal coincidence between the three detectors in the ligo array ( section [ sec : coincidence ] ) . to the extent that noise fluctuations in each of the detectors are random , uncorrelated , and follow poisson statistics , the primary background comes from accidental coincident events , and the accidental triple - coincidence rate can be predicted from the observed instantaneous single - detector event rates .",
    "we have chosen to tune our event trigger generators ( using the playground data sample ) so as to produce an estimated accidental triple - coincidence rate of one event over the entire s1 observation time , as discussed in section [ sec : etgs ] .    again assuming no correlations between noise fluctuations in the three detectors",
    ", we can indirectly measure the rate of accidental triple - coincident events from triple - coincidence rates when artificial time shifts are introduced between single - detector event triggers .",
    "such time shifted triple - coincidence events are free of contamination from true gravitational wave bursts ( assuming that such bursts are rare ) , and thus are an unbiassed estimate of the accidental triple - coincidence rate .",
    "the distribution in the number of time shifted triple - coincidence events should follow a poisson distribution .",
    "these distributions can be fitted to obtain the expected number of background events for use in our statistical analysis .",
    "the time shifts should be larger than the maximum duration of a real ( noise - induced or gravitational wave - induced ) detectable burst , or else the events will be correlated and will not obey poisson statistics .",
    "the time shifts should also be shorter than the typical time scale over which the single - detector event rates vary substantially , so that the number of events for different time shifts will be poisson distributed for a quasi - stationary process .    to establish a lower limit on the time shift required to ensure",
    "uncorrelated noise event triggers , we histogram the time delay between consecutive events in the three detectors , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tfcdel ] for the event trigger generator ( the distributions are similar for the event trigger generator ) .",
    "the distributions of delay times follows the expected exponential form for delay times exceeding 8 seconds ( vertical dashed lines ) , for all three detectors .",
    "any residual auto - correlations present in the data will rapidly decay for delay times exceeding 8 seconds , and in the case of many ( @xmath9 ) time - shift experiments , their potentially biased contribution to the poisson estimate reduce as @xmath10 .",
    "the assumption that noise fluctuations are uncorrelated between detectors is questionable for the two detectors co - located at the hanford site @xcite , h1 and h2 .",
    "indeed , there exists evidence for short - term , narrow - band correlations in the noise power between the h1 and h2 detectors associated with power line harmonics , as well as correlations between l1 and h1 or h2 associated with harmonics of the data acquisition buffer rate @xcite .",
    "the power line harmonics integrate away over long time scales , and the data acquisition buffer rate harmonics only appear after long integration times .",
    "it is the short term correlations that concern us here",
    ". we have found no detectable evidence of short term correlated noise fluctuations associated with these sources of narrow - band correlations .    in order to account for any potential correlations in noise fluctuations between h1 and h2 ,",
    "we have performed our time - shifted coincidence measurements by shifting the time between event triggers found in the l1 data and those found in the h1 and h2 data , while keeping zero time shift between h1 and h2 .",
    "we have performed multiple time - shift experiments with the and event trigger generators between the livingston and hanford sites .",
    "the resulting number of time - shifted triple coincident events from 24 such experiments in the @xmath11 $ ] second range with 8 second steps are shown in figs .",

    "averages and poisson mean values for different step and window sizes vary by less than 0.5 events .        , but for the event trigger generator . ]    in estimating the background rate , we have considered time shifts between 8 seconds ( to avoid correlated events ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : tfcdel ] ) and 100 seconds ( to minimize dependence on any non - stationarity in the instantaneous event rate ) .",
    "these time - shift measurements yield estimates of the number of accidental triple - coincidence ( background ) events @xmath12 for the and event triggers . because these measurements can be made with many , statistically - independent time shifts , the resulting statistical errors on these estimates are small .",
    "the presence of any remaining non - stationarity in the background event rate , however , will result in errors in the background rate estimation .",
    "in fact , the instantaneous event trigger rate is observed to vary for both event trigger generators .",
    "the variability of the trigger rate is sufficiently severe for that the background rate estimation is deemed unreliable .",
    "because of the fixed ( non - adaptive ) threshold employed in the algorithm , the trigger rate of the individual interferometers varies by more than a factor of one thousand , sometimes on timescales of 10 seconds or less .",
    "all five events of the zero time lag coincidences and most of the time - shifted coincidences in fig .",
    "[ fig : slopelag ] come from a single 360-second segment , corresponding to a coincidence of data segments from three interferometers with very high burst singles rates . even within that segment ,",
    "the singles rate varies markedly , making it difficult to reliably estimate the background rate . for this reason ,",
    "we choose not to use the pipeline to set a limit on the rate of gravitational wave bursts  @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that before these coincidences and background rates were available , we decided to set our upper limits using the results from the event trigger generator which yielded the better efficiency for detecting gravitational wave bursts , as measured by our simulations . for almost all waveforms this turned out to be the pipeline ( see section [ sec : sensitivity ] ) .",
    "thus , even if the background rate ( and thus the rate of excess triggers ) from the pipeline could be reliably estimated , the primary results from this search would still be based on the pipeline .",

    "future searches will include a more astrophysical style of interpretation , setting limits on populations of events in three - dimensional space .",
    "efficiency simulations will include more realistic waveforms , such as black hole ringdowns or supernova waveforms @xcite .",
    "higher sensitivity for modeled bursts can be obtained using matched filter techniques .",
    "longer runs will give more opportunities to search for gravitational wave bursts coincident with gamma ray burst events , using the methodology described in @xcite .    finally , and crucially , we are developing criteria by which we can establish confidence in the detection of gravitational wave bursts both statistically and as a single large amplitude burst event . for single burst event candidates , we will use information from all available detectors to reconstruct our best estimates of the gravitational wave direction , polarization , and waveform .",

    "<S> we report on a search for gravitational wave bursts using data from the first science run of the ligo detectors . </S>",
    "<S> our search focuses on bursts with durations ranging from 4 ms to 100 ms , and with significant power in the ligo sensitivity band of 150 to 3000 hz . </S>",
    "<S> we bound the rate for such detected bursts at less than 1.6 events per day at 90%  confidence level . </S>",
    "<S> this result is interpreted in terms of the detection efficiency for ad hoc waveforms ( gaussians and sine - gaussians ) as a function of their root - sum - square strain @xmath0 ; typical sensitivities lie in the range @xmath1 , depending on waveform . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss improvements in the search method that will be applied to future science data from ligo and other gravitational wave detectors . </S>"
