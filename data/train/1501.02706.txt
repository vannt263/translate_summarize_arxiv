    "the first electromagnetic messenger of a gamma  ray burst ( grb ) is the so  called @xmath0ray prompt emission , followed by the early x  ray afterglow on a timescale from minutes to hours .",
    "long duration ( @xmath4@xmath5  s ) grbs are nowadays known to be associated with the core collapse of some kind of massive stars rid of hydrogen envelopes ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "prompt @xmath0rays ( with energies in the kev ",
    "mev range ) are observed within a given grb as a sequence of pulses ( typically a few up to several dozens ) .",
    "in addition , for a sizable fraction of grbs the following decaying x  ray emission , which marks the end of the @xmath0rays , is characterized by the presence of x  ray flares which are sometimes observed as late as @xmath6  s @xcite .",
    "although mounting evidence exists that x ",
    "ray flares , like @xmath0ray pulses , result from the grb inner engine activity rather than from external shocks @xcite , key questions remain unanswered : what radiation process(es ) ?",
    "what information on the inner engine can we extract ?",
    "is there a common process ruling inner engine activity across several decades in time ?    as a matter of fact",
    ", both emissions represent a temporal point process , i.e. a time series characterized by the discrete occurrence of impulsive events superposed on a continuum .",
    "intense bursting periods are often interspersed with relatively long ( several up to tens of seconds ) intervals with very low activity , compatible with the detector background , which are often referred to as quiescent times ( qts ; @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the waiting time distribution ( wtd ) , i.e. of how time intervals between adjacent peaks distribute , provides clues on the nature of the stochastic process .    in particular",
    ", it reveals the degree of memory and correlation and constrains the physical process responsible for the discontinuous and bursty release of energy .",
    "processes showing similar on  off intermittency , or , equivalently , bursty behavior or clusterization , can be found in many fields @xcite .",
    "the corresponding wtds often show power ",
    "law tails at long waiting times ( wts ) , whose index depends on the degree of clusterization of the time series .",
    "examples encompass the aftershock sequence observed in earthquakes , described by omori s law @xcite , neuronal firing activity , as well as a wide range of dynamical systems of human activity , such as mail and email exchanges @xcite , phone calls ( @xcite and references therein ) all the way to violent conflicts @xcite .",
    "these processes are often modeled and interpreted in the context of self  organized criticality ( soc ) , where a nonlinear dynamical system reaches a stable critical point in which continuous energy input is released intermittently through avalanches and in a scale  free way .",
    "soc naturally predicts power  laws in energy and wt distributions .",
    "see @xcite for a recent review on the many areas displaying soc behavior .    in astrophysics",
    "wtds are studied for many different kinds of sources , such as outbursting magnetars @xcite , flare stars @xcite , and particularly the activity of the sun throughout its cycle .",
    "wtds of solar x ",
    "ray flares exhibit power ",
    "law tails with indices in the range @xmath7@xmath8 across several decades @xcite , depending on the class of flares and flux thresholds . related bursty emission from the sun such as coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are found to show very similar wtds , whose index ranges from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in low to high  activity periods of the solar cycle @xcite .",
    "likewise , wtds of solar radio storms @xcite , of solar energetic particle and of solar electron events show very similar power  law indices @xcite .",
    "such power ",
    "law tailed wtds are usually interpreted as the consequence of a time  varying poisson process produced by soc systems , in which the energy input rate is intermittent and directly affects the degree of clusterization of flares @xcite . in this model ,",
    "the bursty energy release is the result of avalanches produced in active regions where magnetic flux is twisted by the moving footpoints , leading to a series of independent magnetic reconnection events and consequent plasma acceleration . alternatively to soc ,",
    "interpretations in the context of fully developed mhd turbulence have also been proposed to explain the bursty dynamics and the power ",
    "law wtd : the intermittent character is the result of a nonlinear dynamics which makes the convective motion of the fluid and magnetic field swing between laminar and turbulent regimes repeatedly and chaotically @xcite .",
    "the wtd between adjacent peaks in grb @xmath0ray prompt emission profiles was found to be described by a lognormal which implies some degree of memory @xcite with an excess at long values due to qts @xcite .",
    "however , when the peak detection efficiency is carefully taken into account , it is found that the intrinsic wtd at short values is also compatible with an exponential , that is what is expected for a _ constant _ poisson ( thus memoryless ) process @xcite . on the other side of the distribution long qts",
    "could either mark the inner engine temporarily switching off , or result from modulation of the relativistic wind of shells @xcite , or they could be due to a different physical mechanism from that of short wts ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in spite of the impressive data that are routinely being acquired in the _ swift _ era , little progress has been reported on wtds in grbs .",
    "recently , energy and wt distributions for grb x  ray flares have been shown to have power ",
    "law tails very similar to what is observed for solar x  ray flares . in particular , the wtd has a power  law index of @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "these results were interpreted as evidence for soc possibly driven by magnetic reconnection episodes triggered in magnetized shells emitted by differentially rotating millisecond pulsars or , alternatively , by an hyperaccreting disk around a black hole @xcite .    yet",
    ", there are several crucial issues which can be tackled with wtds : is there additional evidence for a link between prompt @xmath0rays and late x ",
    "ray flares ? to what extent do qts differ from short wts ?",
    "is it possible to provide a common description of short wts , qts , x ",
    "ray flares ?",
    "what about rest ",
    "frame properties ?",
    "is there evidence for memory in grb engines ?",
    "what can be inferred on grb engines through the wtd study ?    in this paper we address these issues through the analysis of the wtd of grb prompt peaks for three independent data sets : _",
    "swift_/bat , _",

    "section  [ sec : data ] describes the data sample selection and how we modeled the wtds . here",
    "we deliberately did not consider the energy distribution of peaks and flares , because even though our peak search algorithm identified moderately overlapped pulses , estimating their energy would require specific assumptions on their temporal structure .",
    "we therefore decided to postpone it for future investigation .",
    "the results , their implications and interpretation are reported in sections  [ sec : res ] and [ sec : disc ] , respectively .",
    "hereafter , uncertainties on best fit parameters are given at 90% confidence , unless stated otherwise .",
    "we searched all long  duration @xmath0ray light curves with mepsa @xcite , a peak search algorithm designed and calibrated to this goal .",
    "the advantage of mepsa compared with analogous algorithms such as the one by @xcite ( lf ) is twofold :    * it has a lower false positive rate .",
    "this is particularly true for the time intervals in which the signal drops to background between two adjacent activity periods : in the best cases the lf false positive rate is 35@xmath12  bin@xmath13 , while the mepsa one is 12@xmath14  bin@xmath13 @xcite ; * it has a higher true positive rate , especially at low signal to noise ratios ( @xmath1545 ) .",
    "we started with the grbs detected by _",
    "swift_/bat in burst mode from january 2005 to september 2014 , collecting 825 grbs .",
    "we extracted the mask  weighted light curves in the 15150  kev energy band with a uniform bin time of 64  ms following the standard procedure recommended by the bat team and applied mepsa .",
    "we then imposed a minimum threshold of @xmath16 significance , which ensures a very low false positive rate ( @xmath17  bin@xmath13 ; @xcite ) and selected the grbs with at least two peaks .",
    "we then removed from our sample the short duration grbs ( both with and without extended emission ) by crosschecking with the classification provided in the bat catalog @xcite , as they will the subject of future investigation .",
    "since this catalog does not include grbs from 2010 , for these grbs we used the @xmath18 values as published in the bat refined gcn circulars regularly published by the bat team and set a conservative minimum threshold of @xmath19  s. a couple of grbs detected by bat exhibited a very long duration which could not be covered entirely in burst mode : in one case we used the _",
    "wind_/konus light curve for grb091024 @xcite , while in the case of grb130925a we used the peak times as they have been obtained by @xcite from the corresponding konus light curve .",
    "finally , we ended up with a sample of 418 long grbs with at least two significant ( @xmath20 ) peaks each , totaling 2000 peaks and 1582 wts .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this sample as the bat set .",
    "we took the concatenated 64ms burst data distributed by the batse team . for each curve",
    "we interpolated the background by fitting with polynomials of up to fourth degree as suggested by the batse team ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "like in the bat case , we applied mepsa to an initial sample of 2024 light curves in the full passband .",
    "we applied the same selection on the peak significance and selected the long grbs by requiring @xmath21  s , where @xmath18 was taken from the grb catalog @xcite .",
    "we ended up with a sample of 1089 long grbs with at least two @xmath22@xmath23 significant peaks .",
    "overall we collected 7649 peaks and 6560 wts .",
    "hereafter , this will be referred to as the batse sample .",
    "we also applied the same selection procedure to the light curves corresponding to the sum of the two softest energy channels ( 1 and 2 ) and to the sum of the two hardest channels ( 3 and 4 ) , respectively within the 25110  kev and @xmath24110  kev bands .",
    "we collected 1065 and 922 grbs , with 5156 and 4912 wts , respectively .",
    "these two groups will be hereafter referred to as batse12 and batse34 sets , respectively .",
    "we selected 586 long grbs detected with _",
    "@xcite from july 2008 to december 2013 .",
    "we extracted the light curves of the two brightest gbm units in the energy band 81000  kev with 64 ms resolution and subtracted the background through interpolation with a polynomial of up to third degree .",
    "we selected the long grbs by imposing @xmath21  s , where @xmath18 was taken from the official catalog .",
    "we restricted to time intervals whose median values range from @xmath25 to @xmath26  s with reference to the trigger time .",

    "s and after 600  s the time resolution is that of ctime data , @xmath27  s. in most cases we did not consider intervals @xmath28  s , because interpolation - estimated background often becomes critical and the required effort for a proper estimate is beyond our scope @xcite .",
    "we did not consider grbs showing prolonged activity beyond this time interval .",
    "we then applied the same selection criteria as for the previous sets .",
    "finally , by visual inspection we removed phosphorescence spikes due to high  energy particles @xcite , by comparing the same profiles in different gbm units .",
    "we ended up with a final sample of 2383 peaks out of 544 grbs with at least two significant peaks .",
    "the total number of wts is 1839 .",
    "we considered the catalog of 498 x  ray flare candidates detected with _",
    "swift_/xrt obtained by @xcite .",
    "this was extracted from 680 xrt light curves from january 2005 to december 2012 with a method based on the identification of breakpoints in the residuals of the fitted piecewise power ",
    "law light curves : these points mark sudden changes in the mean value due to unfitted features . the optimal set of breakpoints was then found by minimizing the residual sum of squares against piecewise constant functions .",
    "to counter the effect of overfitting with unnecessary breakpoints , they made use of the bayesian information criterion ( see @xcite for further details ) . in this catalog each candidate is assigned a confidence value .",
    "we conservatively selected the subsample with a minimum confidence of 90% , ending up with 205 x  ray flare candidates .",
    "we separately merged each x  ray flare catalog with the bat one by joining , for each grb , the sequence of @xmath0ray peak times and flare peak times into a unique sequence of temporal peaks . in doing this ,",
    "every peak which was seen in both instruments was tagged as a @xmath0ray peak and not considered any more as an x  ray flare .",
    "analogously to the requirements for the previous sets , we selected those grbs with at least two ( either @xmath0 or x  ray ) peaks , so as to have at least one wt .",
    "we ended up with a sample of 1098 ( 954 @xmath0 and 144 x  ray ) peaks in 244 grbs ( 01/2005  12/2012 ) .",
    "we hereafter refer to this joint set as bat - x sample .",
    "finally , we selected the subsample with known redshift , so as to derive the wtd in the source rest  frame .",
    "this was done by simply correcting for cosmic dilation and thus dividing the observed wts by the corresponding @xmath29 . unlike the width of a given pulse , which is affected not only by cosmic dilation but also by the energy passband shift , for their nature wts are affected by the latter to a much lesser extent .",
    "we found 359 wts in 94 grbs with known redshift .",
    "the subset with known redshift will be referred to as bat - xz .",
    "as an independent check , we in parallel considered the x  ray flare catalogs of @xcite and @xcite , which respectively include 113 early  time ( @xmath30  s ) x  ray flares from april 2005 to march 2008 and 36 late  time ( @xmath31  s ) flares from april 2005 to december 2009 . however , due to lower statistics , we hereafter focus on the bat - x sample .      in physics a poisson process is usually assumed to be characterized by a constant expected rate .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : li14_lambda ] ) naturally gives rise to clusterization , i.e. time intervals characterized by an intense activity with a high rate of peaks ( high @xmath34 ) , interspersed with quiescent periods , during which the rate drops significantly ( low @xmath34 ) .",
    "the larger @xmath52 , the shallower the power  law regime at long wts , and the more clustered the time profile @xcite .",

    "level flaring activity which did not pass the 90%confidence threshold in the flare sample selection ( sect .",
    "[ sec : xrtsample ] ) . therefore , grbs with many pulses are unlikely to exhibit flares in the following declining x  ray emission .",
    "our results may be summarized in four fundamental aspects :    1 .",
    "@xmath0ray peaks and x  ray flares are compatible with being different aspects of the same stochastic process , which goes on after the end of the grb itself and spans more than five orders of magnitude in time ; 2 .",
    "short ( interpulse ) and long ( quiescent ) wts between @xmath0ray peaks are different realizations of the same stochastic process , the latters being only less frequent than the formers ; hence a grb with qts and another without are by no means more different from each other than any other kind of grbs are ; 3 .",
    "grbs with several ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0ray pulses are unlikely to exhibit x  ray flares after the end of the prompt emission ; 4 .",
    "@xmath0ray peaks and x  ray flares tend to cluster in much the same way that solar flares , energetic particle events , and cmes do , even though the processes may be different .",
    "the lognormal nature of the wtd originally claimed @xcite has recently been shown to be possibly an artifact of the peak detection algorithms in the short wt end ( @xmath103  s ) , where peaks significantly overlap and can hardly be separated @xcite .",
    "we found that the long value ( @xmath24 few s ) tail needs no more to be described as the sum of a lognormal tail and a power  law excess due to the presence of qts , that were interpreted as a different component @xcite .",
    "this apparent diversity also concerns the so ",
    "called precursors @xcite , which are nothing but emission periods that are less intense than the following activity from which they are separated by a quiescent time . our results ( 1 . and 2",
    "show that all kinds of wts , including precursors , can be described within a common stochastic process , and this holds all the way up to late x ",
    "ray flares , thus pointing towards a common mechanism , which keeps on working during and after the end of the prompt @xmath0ray emission , before the afterglow emission due to the interaction with the external medium takes over .",
    "another question concerns the break at low values in the wtd modeled in terms of the characteristic wt @xmath53 : is it an intrinsic property or is it entirely due to the low efficiency at short values of the peak detection algorithm ?",
    "the capability of separating overlapping structures depends on a number of variables , such as the ratio between wt and peak widths , on intensities , and on temporal structures . while the drop at @xmath104  s is certainly due to the algorithm efficiency , the break itself modeled with @xmath53 is more complex : @xmath53 is shorter at harder energies ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .",
    "a given pulse has a narrower temporal structure at harder energies @xcite , whereas in the softest energy channels there is a slow  varying component @xcite .",
    "the presence of such soft component might hinder the peak identification in some case , so we examined the light curves in the harder channels .",
    "visual inspection suggests that the paucity of subsecond wts with respect to the power ",
    "law extrapolation is real and is unlikely to be a mere artifact of the peak identification process .",
    "in addition , minimum pulse widths observed in grb profiles typically are in the range @xmath105@xmath106  s @xcite .",
    "the mepsa efficiency is above 10% for such pulse widths , for wts @xmath107  s , and for measured signal to noise ratios @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the algorithm efficiency is entirely responsible for the observed exponential cutoff observed in the low end of the wtds .",

    "we briefly summarize the basic ingredients of the model , which are then thoroughly described in the remaining part of this section :    * a number of fragments are independently accreted with the same , constant , probability per unit time ; * the number of available fragments is obviously decreasing with time ; this naturally leads to a time ",

    "let us assume that the disk or the inner part of it has been split into a number of fragments , each of which has the same given probability of accreting per unit time , independently of the others .",
    "the probability for a given fragment to survive up to a given time @xmath37 is proportional to @xmath112 , where @xmath35 is the mean accretion time for each fragment .",

    "[ fig : wtd_toy ] an example of such wtd is shown , with @xmath122 initial fragments , @xmath123  s. as time goes by , @xmath36 decreases and the e  folding of the individual exponential wtds ( thin solid ) increase correspondingly . as a result ,",
    "the total wtd ( thick solid ) show a power  law regime with index 2 at intermediate values of @xmath124 . at @xmath125",
    "the total wtd is dominated by the initial exponential with e  folding @xmath126 , when fragments are all available .",
    "this agrees with the result that the intrinsic ( i.e. , corrected for the algorithm efficiency ) wtd at short values is likely exponential , that is , compatible with a constant poisson process @xcite .",
    "thus far , with reference to eq .",
    "( [ eq : li14_lambda ] ) our model implicitly assumed @xmath64 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : toy1 ] ) . however , in our attempt to reproduce the observed wtd with the piecewise constant process of eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy2 ] ) failed to model the observed break at @xmath127 .",
    "so we required that , when the expected rate becomes comparable or higher than @xmath128 , the number of observed wts is suppressed by a factor of @xmath110 with respect to our model .",
    "this can be interpreted as if , when the number @xmath129 of fragments that can be readily accreted is such that the expected rate is @xmath130 , the overall process becomes inefficient and the rate is suppressed by @xmath110 . in other words ,",
    "the number of wts shorter than @xmath53 is smaller than what is expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy1 ] ) .",
    "this introduces some degree of memory in the initial stages of the accretion process : as long as the number of fragments ready to be accreted is too high ( @xmath131 ) some of them are temporarily halted from accreting by some mechanism connected with the accretion rate itself .",
    "for instance , this self  regulating mechanism could be driven by the magnetic field ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which is known to have a complex role in accretion processes of utterly different objects such as t  tauri stars @xcite .",
    "however , we can not provide a more specific and physical justification for the exponential character of this self  quenching mechanism , which is therefore ad  hoc in its present formulation .",
    "we assumed the logarithmic average and 1-@xmath23 scatter of the bat - x wtd , @xmath132  s and a multiplicative scatter of @xmath133 , to generate the values for @xmath35 for each simulated burst .",
    "the number of generated peaks in each simulated curve was taken from the observed distribution and was augmented by 20% to ensure that the detected peaks were enough ( since some are missed by the algorithm ) .",
    "the peak times for each simulated curve were randomly generated from an exponential distribution with e ",
    "folding @xmath35 , i.e. independently from each other . to mimic the drop in the peak detection efficiency at short wts as well as the mechanism mentioned above about the suppression at high rates , we overlooked each peak occurring within @xmath134  s of the previous one , while through a binomial we assigned each @xmath124 a probability @xmath135 of being observed , where @xmath53 was set to the fitted value of the real wtd ( table  [ tab : fit ] ) .        to obtain a good match with the observed wtd over the same range we had to make a further assumption",
    ": we assumed that for a fraction of grbs ( @xmath111% ) randomly selected through a binomial , the disk is fragmented equally in two groups , the first of which is available for being accreted from the beginning ( @xmath136 ) , while the second one becomes available from @xmath137 on , where @xmath35 is the common mean accretion time for each individual fragment from @xmath138 .",
    "the reason behind this is the observation of two similar bunches of @xmath0ray peaks interspersed with a long quiescent time ( up to several tens of seconds ) for a small fraction of grbs .",
    "physically , this could be the result of an outer part of the disk being accreted at later times with respect to the inner one or , more in general , delayed additional energy reservoir becoming available for late internal dissipation , with minimum variability timescale comparable with that of the early prompt emission @xcite . while the choice of the fraction of such grbs and the duration of the quiescence period are somewhat arbitrary , the good match between simulated and real wtd does not depend crucially on them .",
    "overall , the goal here is just to show the plausibility of the essential properties of this model , which can reproduce the observed properties in spite of the simple assumptions .",
    "we ended up with a set of 903 simulated wts , whose distribution is compared with the real one in fig .  [",
    "fig : dt_toy ] .",
    "we further tested the consequences of this toy model by studying the distribution of the ratio between adjacent wts . while wtds describe how wts distribute as a whole , losing information on their temporal sequence , the ratio distribution focuses on that .",
    "we therefore selected from the bat - x as well as from the simulated sample the grbs with @xmath139 peaks , so as to have at least two wts , and derived the two distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : logratio ] . a ks test between the two sets yields 43% probability that they were drawn from a common population .",
    "logarithmic mean and dispersion for the real ( simulated ) data are @xmath140 and @xmath141 ( @xmath142 and @xmath143 ) .",
    "similar results are obtained adopting other non  parametric tests , such as the wilcoxon  mann ",
    "whitney or the more sensitive epps ",
    "singleton one @xcite , respectively yielding 45% and 9% probability .",
    "interestingly , simply replacing eq .",
    "( [ eq : toy1 ] ) with a constant poisson process and applying the very same following steps , one ends up with a narrower and more zero - centered logarithmic ratio distribution , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which is rejected with high confidence ( p  value @xmath146 ) from a ks test .",
    "this means that for a constant process the ratio is , on average , closer to 1 , and is less scattered around it than real data .",
    "the compatibility of the ratio distribution predicted by the toy model with the real one proves that the temporal sequence of wts is compatible with an evolving poisson process and is incompatible with a constant one on long timescales .",
    "in particular , x  ray flares are nothing but some of the last fragments that are left over and which are accreted on long timescales , when the rate decreases in a granular way , following the very same stochastic process ruling the accretion of the earliest ones .",
    "hence , no correlation is to be expected between @xmath0ray prompt emission duration ( @xmath18 ) and x  ray flares times , in agreement with observations @xcite . finally , the result of sect .",
    "[ sec : pulses_flares ] can be easily explained : grbs with many @xmath0ray peaks accrete fragments rapidly with relatively short @xmath35 , so that at late time very few or none at all are left over for x  ray flares .",
    "the same result could be explained differently though : multi  peaked grbs could have on average a brighter early x  ray afterglow continuum which overshines possible x  ray flares , which would then go unseen .",
    "overall , we assumed a direct connection between emission and observed times of the peaks . within the context of internal shocks the observed time profile of both prompt @xmath0rays and late x ",
    "ray flares is strictly connected to the emission history @xcite .",
    "should this not be the case , little could be inferred about on emission times -and potentially the times of individual accretion episodes- from the study of the observed wtd .",
    "however , this connection becomes more complex due to the variety of lorentz factors associated with the wind of shells colliding with each other . even though the intrinsic duration of the grb engine activity may differ by a factor of a few from the observed one @xcite , on average the temporal sequence of mutual collisions between randomly ",
    "assigned lorentz  factor shells should track the emission time history .",
    "the nature of a given wtd is not altered as a whole when one passes from the emission to the observed times : in fact , each shell has a lorentz factor -which is in principle what can make the observed wts very different from the emitted ones- that is independent of the wts preceding and following that shell .",
    "this statistical independence ensures that the observed wtd keeps memory on the emission time distribution . only at late times ,",
    "when the average lorentz factor is expected to systematically decrease and the statistical independent character likely begins to fail , long wts are likely to be affected as a consequence .",
    "it is remarkable and intriguing that wtds of both solar eruptive events ( x  ray flares , radio storms , high  energy particle events , cmes ) and of grbs can be modeled with the same kind of time - dependent poisson process .",
    "the power  law characterization of the wtd heavy tail must not be overinterpreted from a mathematical viewpoint , since power ",
    "laws are , in general , what one ends up with when dealing with the sum of independent heavy  tailed variables .",
    "it works much in the same way that a normal distribution is the final outcome of the sum of independent finite  variance variables .",
    "in addition , claiming that data are power ",
    "law distributed is contrived whenever the explored range does not cover at least two decades @xcite . in this sense , invoking a soc  driven mechanism for grbs purely based on the power",
    " law character of the wtd , and possibly of the energy distribution too , as suggested for x  ray flares from grbs @xcite or from other black hole systems @xcite , is a stretched interpretation of the data , as we explain below .",
    "the same or very similar power ",
    "law indices imply that both processes have very similar degrees of clusterization , with analogous swings between intense and low ",
    "activity periods , apart from temporal rescaling ( seconds for grbs , hours for the sun ) . however , one has to be careful extending this analogy to a common physical mechanism .",
    "overall , there is a fundamental difference in terms of dynamical systems between grb inner engines during core collapse and the sun : for the latter , the regions where eruptive phenomena take place continuously receive energy , which is then released through avalanches , thus making the soc interpretation plausible ( although alternatives based on mhd turbulence seem equally compatible with observations ) . instead , grb engines are systems which start with a very - far - from - equilibrium configuration , evolve very fast using up all of the available energy , which -no matter how much- is _",
    "limited_. a grb inner engine can not return to its original configuration , it goes through an obviously _ irreversible _ evolution , whereas this is not the case for the solar active regions over sufficiently long timescales . for this reason",
    ", one needs not invoke soc mechanisms related to accretion disks , in particular there is no need for a mechanism like the one proposed to explain @xmath147 fluctuations in black hole power spectra @xcite .",
    "therefore , a simple time  varying poisson process explains the secular evolution of the mean rate of bursts / flares as well as the stochastic independent character of individual energy release episodes .",
    "this model disregards the physical origin of fragmentation and how energy is distributed among different fragments : thus , in principle it is compatible with various physical drivers , such as gravitational @xcite , or magnetorotational instability @xcite .",
    "in this paper we studied the waiting time distributions of grb @xmath0ray pulses in three catalogs , _",
    "cgro_/batse , _",
    "fermi_/gbm , and _ swift_/bat . for the latter , for the first time we merged @xmath0ray pulses and x  ray flares detected with _ swift_/xrt belonging to the same grbs , and for a subsample",
    "the same analysis was carried out in the source rest  frame .",
    "we found that all wtds can be described in terms of a common time ",
    "varying poisson process that rules different waiting time intervals , which thus far in the literature have been treated differently : specifically , we showed that short wts ( @xmath103  s ) , long quiescent times ( @xmath148  s ) all the way up to late time x  ray flares are the manifestation of a common stochastic process .",
    "grb wtds exhibit heavy tails which are modeled with power  laws over 45 decades in time with indices in the range @xmath149@xmath150 , depending on the relative weight of late time events , such as x  ray flares , in each grb sample . because of the ubiquitous nature of power",
    " laws ( central limit theorem for heavy  tailed distributions ) , the character of wtds must not be imbued with a mystical sense or overinterpreted as evidence for a universal process . in this sense ,",
    "the similarity of the wtd power ",
    "law index with that of solar eruptive phenomena , such as flares and coronal mass ejections , proves nothing but a similar degree of clusterization in time .",
    "nonetheless , it is remarkable that the wtd of @xmath0ray pulses and that of x  ray flares not only have compatible power ",
    "law indices but they join and extend the dynamical range for a common sample of grbs . all this points to a common stochastic process ruling both phenomena .",
    "the unification under a common process of all different kinds of waiting times in grbs ( short interpulse times , long quiescent times , time intervals following precursors , time intervals between the end of the @xmath0ray prompt emission and subsequent x ",
    "ray flares ) is a new result .",
    "another noteworthy result is that grbs with many ( @xmath2 ) @xmath0ray pulses are unlikely ( @xmath151 confidence in gaussian units ) to exhibit x  ray flares in their subsequent early x ",
    "ray emission .",
    "this result is naturally explained in the context of the time  varying poisson process : many pulses observed in the prompt of a given grb are indicative of a relatively short mean accretion time for a single disk fragment .",
    "consequently , most of the available fragments are consumed during the prompt phase , with very few or none at all left over for the subsequent phase .    in the light of the irreversible evolution of grb",
    "inner engines , the interpretation of a time - varying poisson process appears to be simple and reasonable : the secular evolution of the expected rate of events is naturally linked to the energy reservoir being gradually used up , whereas the stochastically independent accretion of individual fragments is explained by the poissonian character of the process .",
    "although self  organized criticality models naturally predict power ",
    "law tailed distributions of waiting times and energy , drawing upon this kind of dynamics for grbs might be premature .",
    "other equally plausible alternatives , such as fully developed mhd turbulence , can explain the same properties , as it was suggested for the solar case .",
    "possible evidence for turbulence in grbs has also been suggested from the analysis of power density spectra @xcite . yet",
    ", we find that a simple time  varying poisson process such as that of a system gradually using up all the available pieces already provides a remarkably accurate description",
