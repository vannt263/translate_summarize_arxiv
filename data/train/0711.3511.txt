    "two - dimensional crystals of carbon atoms ( graphene ) are recently discovered  @xcite .",
    "graphene , a single , one - atom thick sheet of carbon atoms arranged in a honeycomb lattice .",
    "high quality graphene single crystals some thousands of @xmath0 in size are sufficient for most fundamental physics studies .",
    "@xcite there are significant efforts to grow graphene epitaxially  @xcite by thermal decomposition of sic , or by vapor deposition of hydrocarbons on catalytic metallic surfaces which could later be etched away leaving graphene on an insulating substrate .",
    "this stable crystal has attracted considerable attention because of its unusual effective many - body properties  @xcite , quasi - particle properties and its landau fermi liquid picture  @xcite and the effect of electron - electron interactions to plasmon behavior and angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes )  @xcite that follow from chiral band states and because of potential applications .",
    "the low energy quasi - particle excitations in graphene are linearly dispersing , described by dirac cones at the edges of the first brillouin zone .",
    "it is very hard for alien atoms to replace the carbon atoms in the graphene structure because of the robustness and specificity of the @xmath1 bonding . due to that , electron mean - free path @xmath2 , in graphene can be very large .",
    "one of the important issues in graphene is its quantum transport properties having the universal minimum conductivity at the dirac point .",
    "initially , it was believed that this universality is a native property  @xcite but recent experimental@xcite and theoretical@xcite reports indicate that the transport properties are very sensitive to impurities and defects and minimum conductivity is not universal .",
    "conventional two - dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) has been a fertile source of surprising new physics for more than four decades .",
    "although the exploration of graphene is still at an early stage , it is already clear  @xcite that the strong field properties of dirac electrons in graphene are different from and as rich as those of a semiconductor heterojunction 2deg .",
    "the fermi liquid phenomenology of dirac electrons in graphene  @xcite and conventional 2deg  @xcite have the same structure , since both systems are isotropic and have a single circular fermi surface .",
    "the strength of interaction effects in a conventional 2deg increases with decreasing carrier density . at low densities ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xmath3 is small , the velocity is suppressed  @xcite , the charge compressibility changes sign from positive to negative@xcite , and the spin - susceptibility is strongly enhanced  @xcite .",
    "these effects emerge from an interplay between exchange interactions and quantum fluctuations of charge and spin in the 2deg .    in the dirac electrons in graphene",
    ", it was shown  @xcite that interaction effects also become noticeable with decreasing density , although more slowly , that the quasiparticle weight @xmath3 tends to larger values , that the velocity is enhanced rather than suppressed , and that the influence of interactions on the compressibility and the spin - susceptibility changes sign .",
    "these qualitative differences are due to exchange interactions between electrons near the fermi surface and electrons in the negative energy sea and to interband contributions to dirac electrons from charge and spin fluctuations .    compressibility measurements of conventional 2deg have been carried out  @xcite and it is found qualitatively that coulomb interactions affect the compressibility at sufficiently low electron density or strong coupling constant region .",
    "recently , the local compressibility of graphene has been measured  @xcite using a scannable single electron transistor and it is argued that the measured compressibility is well described by the kinetic energy contribution and it is suggested that exchange and correlation effects have canceling contributions . from the theoretical point of view , the compressibility was first calculated by peres _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite considering the exchange contribution to the noninteracting doped or undoped graphene flake . a related quantity @xmath4 ( where @xmath5 is the chemical potential and @xmath6 is the electron density ) is recently considered by hwang _ et al_.@xcite within the same approximation .",
    "going beyond the exchange contribution , the correlation effects were taken into account by barlas _",
    "@xcite based on an evaluation of graphene s exchange and random phase approximation ( rpa ) correlation energies .",
    "moreover , sheehy and schmalian  @xcite by exploiting the proximity to relativistic electron quantum critical point , derived explicit expressions for the temperature and density dependence of the compressibility properties of graphene .",
    "all these theoretical efforts have been carried out for clean systems . since disorder is unavoidable in any material , there has been great interest in trying to understand how disorder affects the physics of electrons in material science specially here in graphene and its transport properties .",
    "our aim in this work is to study the ground - state properties in the presence of electron - impurity and electron - electron interactions . for this purpose",
    ", we use the self - consistent theory of gtze @xcite to calculate the scattering rate , ground - state energy and the compressibility of the system at the level of rpa including disorder effects .",
    "our calculation is in the same spirit of our earlier work on conventional 2deg.@xcite we note that recent work of adam _",
    "et al_.@xcite also use a self - consistent approach where the impurity scattering by the charge carriers is treated self - consistently in the rpa and the static conductivity is calculated in the boltzmann kinetic theory .",
    "thus , the main difference between the present work and that of adam _",
    "et al_.@xcite is that we are interested in a thermodynamic quantity ( compressibility ) whereas the latter is aimed at calculating a transport property ( conductivity ) .",
    "we also remark that direct solution of dirac equation for dirac - like electrons incorporating the charge impurities has been discussed by novikov  @xcite and the validity of the born approximation is seriously questioned .",
    "similar work has been carried out by pereira _",
    "et al_.@xcite in which they studied the problem of a coulomb charge and calculated the local density of state and local charge by solving the dirac equation .",
    "they found new characteristics of bound states and strong renormalization of the van hove singularities in the lattice description that are beyond the dirac equation .",
    "in this work , we consider the charged impurity and the surface - roughness potentials which are established experimentally  @xcite to be important .",
    "it has been demonstrated that a short - range scattering potential is irrelevant for electronic properties of graphene  @xcite .",
    "we have used the same method  @xcite to investigate some properties of the conventional 2deg . in this paper , we point out the differences between the graphene and conventional 2deg due to disorder effects .",
    "the scattering rate behavior within our self - consistent theory shows that impurity scattering can not localize the carriers in graphene .",
    "the effect of disorder on spin susceptibility is similar to that on compressibility and accordingly we will not show any result for spin susceptibility .    the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , we introduce the models for self - consistent calculation of impurities effect .",
    "we then outline the calculation of compressibility .",
    "section iii contains our numerical calculations of ground state properties and comparison of models with recent experimental measurements .",
    "we conclude in sec.iv with a brief summary .",
    "we consider a system of 2d dirac - like electrons interacting via the coulomb potential @xmath7 and its fourier transform @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the background dielectric constant .",
    "the dirac electron gas hamiltonian on a graphene sheet is given by @xmath10 { \\hat \\psi}_{{\\bf k } , \\alpha }   + \\frac{1}{2a}\\sum_{{\\bf q}\\neq 0}v_q ( { \\hat n}_{\\bf q } { \\hat n}_{-{\\bf q}}-{\\hat n})\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the fermi velocity , @xmath12 is the tight - binding hopping integral , @xmath13 is the spacing of the honeycomb lattice , @xmath14 is the sample area and @xmath15 is the total number operator . here @xmath16 is a pauli matrix that acts on @xmath17 and @xmath18 two - degenerate valleys at which @xmath19 and @xmath20 bands touch and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are pauli matrices that act on graphene s pseudospin degrees of freedom .",
    "a central quantity in the theoretical formulation of the many - body effects in dirac fermions is the dynamical polarizability tensor @xmath23 where @xmath5 is chemical potential .",
    "this is defined through the one - body noninteracting green s functions.@xcite the density - density response function @xmath24 of the doped two - dimensional dirac electron model was first consider by shung  @xcite as a step toward a theory of collective excitations in graphite .",
    "the dirac electron @xmath25 expression has been considered recently by us  @xcite and others .",
    "@xcite implementing the green s function @xmath26 in the calculation a closed form expression for @xmath27 is found.@xcite to describe the properties of dirac electrons we define a dimensionless coupling constant @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the valley and spin degeneracy .",
    "the effect of disorder is to dampen the charge - density fluctuations and results to modify the dynamical polarizability tensor . within the relaxation time approximation the modified @xmath30",
    "is given by  @xcite @xmath31}~,\\ ] ] in which the strength of damping is represented by @xmath32 .",
    "to include the many - body effects , we consider the density - density correlation function within the rpa , @xmath33    as the short - range disorder is shown  @xcite to have negligible effect in the transport properties of graphene , we consider long - ranged charged impurity scattering and surface roughness as the main sources of disorder .",
    "the latter mechanism also known as ripples comes either from thermal fluctuations or interaction with the substrate.@xcite the disorder averaged surface roughness ( ripples ) potential ( srp ) is modeled as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 are parameters describing fluctuations in the height and width , respectively .",
    "we can use the experimental results of meyer _",
    "al_.@xcite who estimate @xmath37 nm and @xmath38 nm . it is important to point out that there are other models to take into account the surface - roughness potential .",
    "the effect of bending of the graphene sheet has been studied by kim and castro neto  @xcite .",
    "this model has two main effects , firstly the decrease of the distance between carbon atoms and secondly a rotation of the @xmath39 orbitals . due to bending",
    "the electrons are subject to a potential which depends on the structure of the graphene sheet .",
    "another possible model is described by katsnelson and geim  @xcite considering the change of in - plane displacements and out - of - plane displacements due to the local curvature of a graphene sheet .",
    "consequently , the change of the atomic displacements results to change in nearest - neighbour hopping parameters which is equivalent to the appearance of a random gauge field described by a vector potential .",
    "these different models need to be implemented in our scheme and to be checked numerically to assess their validity in comparison to the available measurements .",
    "the charged disorder potential ( cdp ) is taken to be @xmath40 in which @xmath41 is the density of impurities and @xmath42 is the setback distance from the graphene sheet .",
    "we use the mode - coupling approximation introduced by gtze@xcite to express the total scattering rate in terms of the screened disorder potentials @xmath43 @xmath44\\frac{\\varphi_0({\\bf q},i\\gamma)}{1+i\\gamma\\varphi_0({\\bf q},i\\gamma)/\\chi^{0}({\\bf q})}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the static screening function and the relaxation function for electrons scattering from disorder is given as @xmath46/i\\gamma$ ] .",
    "since the scattering rate @xmath32 depends on the relaxation function @xmath47 , which itself is determined by the disorder included response function , the above equation needs to be solved self - consistently to yield eventually the scattering rate as a function of the coupling constant .",
    "note that at the present level of approximation ( i.e. rpa ) the static dielectric function @xmath48 does not depend on @xmath32 . in the conventional 2deg correlation effects beyond the rpa ( through the local - field factor )",

    "we consider @xmath80 nm . electron density is taken to be @xmath81@xmath82 for figs.1 - 3 .    increasing disorder ( increasing @xmath41 or decreasing @xmath42 for charge - disorder potential or increasing @xmath35 for surface roughness potential ) decrease the @xmath83 as the scattering rate @xmath32 gets bigger .",
    "thus , decreasing @xmath83 ( or increasing correlation effects ) results in a stronger disorder potential . despite @xmath32 increases with increasing @xmath50 ,",
    "apparently it turns to a saturation limit and does not diverge .",
    "this behavior is quite different than what is seen in conventional 2deg  @xcite when the many - body effects influence the scattering rate through the local - field factor . in the conventional 2deg system , at a critical level of disorder",
    "this nonlinear feedback causes @xmath32 to increase rapidly and diverge , which is taken as an indication for the localization of carriers .",
    "however , in graphene , our calculations show that the @xmath32 does not diverge therefore impurities can not localize carriers and we have a weakly localized system in the presence of impurities compatible with experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "we can understand the saturated behavior of @xmath32 qualitatively as follows . in the context of conventional 2deg",
    ", mott argument says that the mean - free path @xmath2 in a metal could not be shorter than the wavelength @xmath84 . since @xmath2 is proportional to the inverse of @xmath32 , for large values of @xmath32",
    "obtained in 2deg , the electron mean - free path decreases and becomes less than or equal to @xmath84 . at this point",
    "we should have a metal - insulator phase transition . in the context of graphene ,",
    "on the other hand , mott s argument is similar to that light does not notice any roughness ( one source of scattering ) on a scale shorter than its wavelength .",
    "consequentely there is a lower limit for the electron s mean - free path in graphene and it turns out that we would have a maximum ( saturation ) value for @xmath32 .    the issue of localization in graphene has recently attracted some attention and the chiral nature of electron behavior has been discussed in the literature .",
    "@xcite suzuura and ando  @xcite claimed that the quantum correction to the conductivity in graphene can differ from what is observed in normal 2deg due to the nature of elastic scattering in graphene possibly changing the sign of the localization correction and turn weak localization into weak antilocalization for the region when intervalley scattering time is much larger than the phase coherence time .",
    "further consideration of the behavior of the quantum correction to the conductivity in graphene  @xcite conclude that this behavior is entirely suppressed due to time - reversal symmetry breaking of electronic states around each degenerate valley .",
    "we have found through our calculations that @xmath32 increases with increasing @xmath85 as a function of @xmath50 .",

    "it is found that the disorder effects become more appreciable at large coupling constants , within the mode coupling approximation .",
    "the exchange energy is positive  @xcite because our regularization procedure implicitly selects the chemical potential of undoped graphene as the zero of energy ; doping either occupies quasiparticle states with positive energies or empties quasiparticles with negative energies .",
    "figure  2(a ) shows the correlation energy @xmath88 as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "it appears that the disorder effects become more appreciable at large coupling constant .",

    "figure  3 shows the charge compressibility , @xmath74 scaled by its non - interacting contribution as a function of @xmath50 for various models of @xmath32 .",
    "the behavior of @xmath70 shows some novel physics , which is qualitatively different from the physics known in the conventional 2deg .",
    "exchange makes a positive contribution to the inverse compressibility and thus tends to reduce ( rather than enhance ) the compressibility . on the other hand",
    ", correlations make a negative contribution to the inverse compressibility and thus tends to enhance @xmath70 . in the conventional 2deg both contributions tend to enhance the compressibility . in the case of graphene instead , apparently exchange and correlation compete with each other  @xcite in determining the compressibility of the system .",
    "it is interesting to note that similar physics is true also in the spin susceptibility  @xcite .    in fig .",

    "@xcite fitted the experimental inverse compressibility , @xmath96 to the kinetic term using a single parameter fermi velocity which is larger than the bare fermi velocity .",
    "note that the kinetic term in graphene has the same density dependence as the leading exchange and correlations terms .    as it is clear in fig .",
    "4 the inverse compressibility of noninteracting system is below the experimental data . by increasing the interaction effects ,",
    "i.e. , increasing the coupling constant strength , @xmath50 our theoretical results move up .",
    "unfortunately , in the experimental sample , the value of @xmath50 is not specified and we considered it to be @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , including the exchange - correlation effects in our rpa theory , gives results very close to experimental data .",
    "furthermore , the results of incorporating impurity density , @xmath98@xmath82 in the system and solving the self - consistent equations to obtain the scattering rate value , yield very good agreement with the measured values in the large and middle electron density regions .",
    "we have examined the inverse compressibility by the kinetic term contribution only including a fitting value for fermi velocity and our numerical results are well described by a fitting velocity about @xmath99 .",
    "we would stress here that this fitting velocity is different from the renormalized velocity defined within the landau - fermi liquid theory in graphene .",
    "@xcite    in a recent calculation of @xmath4 within the hartre - fock approximation in graphene where @xmath5 is the chemical potential and @xmath6 is the electron density hwang _",
    "et al_.@xcite stated that correlation and disorder effects would only introduce small corrections .",
    "this is not , in general , true since it has been shown by barlas _",
    "et al_.@xcite that the correlation effects are essential in the ground - state properties . although these effects are not significant in very weak interaction strength regime and high electron density , including many - body exchange - correlation effects together with disorder effect are necessary to get agreement with quantities measured in experiments of martin _",
    "et al_.@xcite it would be useful to carry out further experimental work at larger interaction strengths to assess the role played by correlation effects .",
    "we have studied the ground state thermodynamic properties of a graphene sheet within the random phase approximation incorporating the impurities in the system .",
    "our approach is based on a self - consistent calculation between impurity effect and many - body electron - electron interaction .",
    "we have used a model surface roughness potential together with the charged disorder potential in the system .",
    "our calculations of inverse compressibility compared with recent experimental results of martin _",
    "et al_.@xcite demonstrate the importance of including correlation effects together with disorder effects correctly in the thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we remark that in a very small density region , the system is highly inhomogeneous where experimental data tends to a constant and the effect of the impurities are very essential .",
    "a model going beyond the rpa is necessary to account for increasing correlation effects at low density . to describe the experimental data in this region more sophisticated theoretical methods which incorporate inhomogeneities",
    "are needed .",
    "one approach would be the density - functional theory where dirac electrons in the presence of impurities are considered .",
