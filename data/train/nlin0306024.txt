    "from the point of view of chaotic dynamics , the hamiltonian systems are marked out by the omnipresence of chaos : for nearly any hamiltonian system with not less than one and a half degrees of freedom ( with the exemption of completely integrable models that are non - robust and therefore exceptionally rare ) the chaotic motion is possible for some initial conditions .",
    "on the contrary , for the dissipative systems of the same complexity of the structure chaotic motion on strange attractors either could be attained only in limited domains of the parameter space or is inaccessible at all @xcite .",
    "inclusion of the dissipative terms , even arbitrarily small , in the canonical equations of motion of the hamiltonian system can change the character of the motion drastically .",
    "in particular , such addition can banish the chaos : for example , for the autonomous hamiltonian systems with added ( viscous ) damping the only possible attractors are stable fixed points .",
    "it must be noted that this abrupt change may be basically formal , resulting from the presence of the transition to the infinite time limit in the rigorous definitions of important characteristics of chaotic motion , like the lyapunov exponent and correlators of dynamic variables . in many experimentally relevant models",
    "the ratio of the dissipation @xmath0 to the typical frequency of motion @xmath1 may take very small values .",
    "thus , for radiation damping of vibrations of polyatomic molecules one has @xmath2 ; the same order of magnitude of @xmath3 turns out for the tidal friction of the celestial bodies of the solar system . in these situations",
    "the duration of the `` transient chaos '' phase @xmath4 is so long that accurate determination of characteristics of the chaotic motion can be carried out without the account of dissipation .",
    "physically the introduction of dissipation in the equations of motion is a form of description of the interaction of an isolated ( in the zeroth approximation ) system with its environment - a `` heat bath '' with practically infinite number of degrees of freedom , continuous spectrum of eigenfrequencies and internal dynamics that is independent of the state of the selected system .",
    "this heat bath may be considered also as a source of noise - that is , acting on the selected system random forces , whose statistical characteristics are determined by the properties of the heat bath alone .",
    "the problem of simultaneous influence of small dissipation and weak noise on the features of chaotic motion in the originally hamiltonian non - autonomous system is the main concern of this paper .",
    "the studies of the influence of noise on chaotic motion were pioneered by lieberman and lichtenberg @xcite just by analysis of the effect of fluctuations on the hamiltonian non - autonomous system .",
    "however , the modern paradigm of the domain was formed later by crutchfield and huberman @xcite who switched the attention to the exploration of strongly dissipative systems ( see late review @xcite ) .",
    "the influence of noise on the hamiltonian systems has been discussed recently in the context of the problem of decay of metastable chaotic states @xcite , but in general the field does nt seem to be fully investigated .    on the contrary , the influence of small dissipation on the hamiltonian chaos is well understood : afraimovich , rabinovich , and ugodnikov @xcite have shown , that with switching on a small dissipation phase trajectories of stable periodic motions of the hamiltonian non - autonomous systems become attractors with regular motion , and chaos disappears . with the further increase of @xmath0 these attractors may lose their stability ; annihilation of the last one turns the system back into chaotic motion on a strange attractor , that resembles the chaotic motion of the original hamiltonian system . this pattern needs two specifications .",
    "first , the strange attractor may emerge before vanishing of the last of regular ones - the system could be multistable .",
    "this case , mentioned in @xcite as `` logically possible '' , will be met in our model . secondly",
    ", if the hamiltonian system has no islands of stability that correspond to periodic motion , then the transition from hamiltonian to dissipative chaos can occur immediately .",
    "this case , apparently , will be present in our model too .",

    "vi contains the summary of results and their discussion .",

    "( [ 50 ] ) ( line ) and numerical calculation ( points ) . ]    for large values of @xmath208 and small temperatures the value of @xmath206 could be calculated from the distribution eq .",
    "( [ 37 ] ) : @xmath209 it is compared to the numerical data in fig .",
    "the numerical calculation shows in this case the decrease of @xmath206 with @xmath19 for sufficiently high temperatures .",
    "the reason for it is qualitatively clear .",
    "we have two competing contributions to @xmath206 : a negative one from the island of stability and a smaller positive one from the motion in the chaotic component .",
    "the increase of the temperature leads to the increase of the probability @xmath99 of the motion within the chaotic component , that eventually suppresses the negative contribution .",
    "the way of accurate calculation of @xmath206 for high temperatures at present is not known .",
    "thence both for small and large values of the control parameter @xmath8 the increase of the noise temperature ( from zero ) induces first the increase of the correlation of the consequent values of the angular variable @xmath207 up to some maximal value , and then its decrease .",
    "above we have studied the model of periodically kicked rotor with added damping and white noise .",
    "we expect that some of the established features and relations are typical and will hold at least qualitatively for many representative non - autonomous hamiltonian systems with chaotic motion . with this in view , in this section we summarize main results of this paper in a generalized way . since the growth of the control parameter of the standard mapping @xmath8 increases both the amount ( given by the invariant measure @xmath210 of the chaotic component ) and the intensity ( given by lyapunov exponent @xmath53 ) of chaos we will refer to @xmath8 as to the strength of chaos . in",
    "what follows ( as well as everywhere above ) the lyapunov exponent denotes the largest of the characteristic exponents of the stroboscopic mapping of the system that can take negative as well as positive values ( one have to keep in view that for systems - flows with finite phase velocity there is always one zero characteristic lyapunov exponent that corresponds to evolution of the infinitesimal displacement along the phase trajectory ) .    * 1 . *",
    "if chaos in a hamiltonian system is suppressed by addition of small dissipation , then addition of white noise can , as a rule , restore the chaotic motion .",
    "the exception is found only for very weak chaos , when the system remains regular at arbitrarily intense noise ( see sec .",
    "the increase of the noise intensity raises the lyapunov exponent . in wide context",
    "this fact is not quite trivial , since there is an example of the system for which noise diminishes the ( positive ) lyapunov exponent , eventually turning it negative @xcite .",
    "the temperature threshold of chaos depends on the strength of chaos of the hamiltonian system in a non - monotonous way ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . for weak chaos it increases with the strength ( in our model  by linear law , see eq .",
    "( [ 25 ] ) ) , since the effective `` potential well '' corresponding to the island of stability becomes deeper , whereas for strong chaos the threshold decreases due to the shrinking of the islands of stability .",
    "there are two essentially different mechanisms of the chaotization of motion by noise .",
    "the first one is the fluctuational transfer of the motion from the stability island to the locally unstable regions of the phase space ; its contribution to the lyapunov exponent depends on the noise temperature by the `` activation law '' , @xmath211 ( see eqs . ( [ 23 ] ) and ( [ 28 ] ) and fig .",
    "the second is the parametric destabilization inside the islands of stability created by small fluctuations of nonlinear terms of the stroboscopic mapping ; its contribution to the lyapunov exponent depends on the noise temperature by the power law , @xmath212 ( see eqs .",
    "( [ 32 ] ) and ( [ 40 ] ) and fig .",
    "any one of these mechanisms could be dominating , depending on the combination of parameters .",
    "* 4 . * around the threshold of chaos the motion of the system with damping and noise differs strongly from the chaotic motion of the original hamiltonian system .",
    "it is concentrated mainly within the islands of stability with only rare excursions to the domain of the phase space occupied by the chaotic component of the prototype . in this aspect",
    "the restoration of chaos `` by noise '' differs radically from the restoration of chaos `` by damping '' @xcite .",
    "the similarity to the original motion could be reached in the domain of strong chaos and high noise temperatures @xmath213 ( see fig .",
    "lastly it must be noted that the existence of the range of parameters where the transition from hamiltonian to dissipative chaos is immediate ( see fig .",
    "1 ) may be specific for the studied model of periodically kicked rotor . in this range",
    "the influence of noise on chaos has qualitative peculiarities : e.g. the increase of noise could reduce the lyapunov exponent ( for @xmath214 and @xmath215 at @xmath216 @xmath217 , and at @xmath218 @xmath219 ) . the scenario of the immediate transition and related problems for noisy systems may deserve a special study .",
