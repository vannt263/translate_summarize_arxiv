    "over the last decade , one of the main challenges in theoretical physics , and particularly in cosmology , refers to identifying the mysterious nature of the two main matter components that , according to the observations and most of the theoretical frameworks , compose the universe , the so - called dark energy and dark matter . while the latter is likely behaving nowadays as a pressureless fluid , the former should have a negative pressure effectively in order to explain the accelerating expansion of the universe .",
    "most of the dark energy models assume an extra and unknown field which would be the responsible of the acceleration of the expansion , but other realistic proposals include infrared modifications of general relativity ( for some reviews , see @xcite ) . in any case",
    ", the main problem arises because of the large number of models , either extra fields or modified gravities , capable of explaining the observational data , and leading to similar statistical evidence .",
    "however , searching for models that include other effects may provide an alternative way of exploring the nature of the dark sector , to hopefully allow for discriminating among the different theoretical models . in this sense , some proposals introduce the possibility of an interaction among dark matter and dark energy , which may reveal new features of both components ( for a recent review see @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , several interacting terms have been suggested , where basically the full lagrangian include a particular interaction term , including non - minimally coupling theories @xcite . a different and more phenomenological way of exploring such a possibility goes directly through the field equations , where an interacting term , usually named by the letter @xmath0 , is included in the continuity equations in such a way that the total energy is conserved but a flow of energy exists between the two components , modelled both as effective perfect fluids @xcite-@xcite .",
    "note that , in spite of fact that these models are reconstructed phenomenologically , they may be deduced from a variational principle @xcite .",
    "moreover , one of the main motivations for considering dark couplings besides the search of new physics , lies on the possibility of solving the coincidence problem , since by a suitable coupling term , an attractor solution that leads to the same ratio for both dark components exist @xcite .",
    "actually , the existence of a well behaved phase space when assuming some particular interactions has drawn a lot of attention towards these models @xcite .",
    "moreover , the existence of such scenario has been explored in different frameworks , from holographic dark energy to periodic universes or future singularities @xcite",
    ". however , such interacting models are not free of some issues , as the possible existence of large instabilities at early cosmological times @xcite , which depends on the type of interaction considered @xcite .",
    "moreover , observations point out to the viability of some of these interactions , where different sources of data , from supernovae to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , allow such possibility @xcite .",
    "moreover , some dark energy models own an effective equation of state ( eos ) that violates the null energy condition , @xmath1 . such a violation can be easily achieved by extra ( scalar or vector ) fields or through modifications of gr , leading to the same phenomenological perfect fluid , usually called _ phantom _ @xcite .",
    "the interesting point arises because these phantom models may give rise to divergences on some magnitudes at a finite time , with the potential danger of inducing the presence of a physical singularity .",
    "for instance , the so - called _ big rip _ , which is probably the most well known example of a future singularity , leads to an infinite scale factor at a finite time , called the _ rip _ time .",
    "such a singularity would eventually break every binding structure in the universe , while the effects of quantum gravity should become important at certain time before the singularity .",
    "moreover , other future singularities have been analyzed , which may not be properly a singularity in the sense of geodesic ( in)completeness but may still lead to arbitrarily large tidal forces .",
    "in addition , note that an eos for dark energy @xmath2 is allowed by observational data ( and from some sources , favoured @xcite ) , such that so a future singular scenario may be plausible . in this sense ,",
    "the classification provided in ref .",
    "@xcite and updated in ref .",
    "@xcite , shows how each divergence , usually related to the scale factor and its derivatives , affects the universe expansion and its structures . moreover , there are alternative non - singular scenarios ( understood as the absence of divergences in finite time ) that may lead to the break of some structures , as the _ little rip _ @xcite .    in this paper , we present an analysis of such singularities within the framework of interacting dark energy - dark matter models . by describing such interaction in an effective way through the continuity equations , we find that every singularity is just the consequence of one , what we call _ @xmath0-singularity_.",
    "this means that the flow of energy between the dark matter and dark energy components diverges at finite time , inducing a divergence on the scale factor and/or its derivatives , leading to one of the future singularities analyzed in the literature .",
    "in addition , a new future singularity is analyzed , where the @xmath0-singularity provides a divergence on the derivative of the eos for dark energy , where assumed a dynamical dark energy fluid .",
    "hence , we analyze several kind of interacting terms and eos for dark energy , studying those cases where the interacting term diverges .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : ii ] a review on cosmological singularities is given .",
    "section [ sec : iii ] is devoted to the introduction of the @xmath0-singularities , where several ansatze are considered and some models reconstructed . in section [ sec : iv ] , some interacting terms , previously analyzed in the literature , are considered , where for some particular eos for dark energy a @xmath0-singularity occurs .",
    "finally , section [ sec : v ] contains the conclusions of the paper .",
    "assuming a homogeneous and isotropous universe at large scales , in agreement with the cosmological principle , the line element for a spatially flat friedman - lematre - robertson - walker ( flrw ) metric is given by    [ eq : flrw ] ds^2=-dt^2+a(t)^2(dx^2+dy^2+dz^2 )  , where @xmath3 is the scale factor .",
    "for the matter sector we shall assume it to be described by a perfect fluid , with stress - energy momentum tensor    [ eq : pf ] t_=(+p ) u _ u _ + p g _  , where @xmath4 is a unit vector , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energy density and pressure of the fluid , respectively .",
    "under these assumptions , solving the einstein equations , @xmath8 , where @xmath9 yields the system of equations    [ eq : fried ] h^2= ; = -(+p )  .",
    "these equations are enough to determine the background evolution of the hubble parameter , @xmath10 ( a dot denotes a time derivative ) , once the matter content ( [ eq : pf ] ) is fully specified . the latter yields its own system of equations , @xmath11 , which can be trivially solved for an arbitrary ( but constant ) eos , @xmath12 , as @xmath13 . inserting this result into the friedman equations ( [ eq : fried ] ) yields the well known result    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is some constant .",
    "then one just need to provide a specific equation of state @xmath16 and eq.([eq : hasol ] ) gives a full solution .",
    "this immediately brings forward a problem : if @xmath17 the above solution leads to an expanding universe such that at @xmath18 both the scale factor @xmath3 and the energy density @xmath6 diverge .",
    "this is indeed the tip of a broader problem , where depending on the properties of the matter under consideration , some quantities may diverge at the time @xmath18 , which is potentially troublesome .    in a curved space - time",
    "the trouble with singularities is very subtle , and a broad literature deals with this problem from different perspectives . in this sense ,",
    "the most rigorous and well accepted criterion about the nature of spacetime singularities rely on the concept of _ geodesic completeness _ ,",
    "namely , whether any null and time - like geodesic can be extended to arbitrarily large values of its affine parameter or not @xcite . in this sense , a number of theorems have been established to determine the conditions upon which a given spacetime contains a singularity .",
    "these theorems give a precise mathematical formulation to the physically intuitive idea that , being null geodesics attached to the transmission of information and time - like geodesics to the free falling of idealized physical observers , in a well behaved spacetime nothing should suddenly cease to exist or emerge from nowhere .",
    "let us review the analysis of the geodesic equation when assuming a flat flrw spacetime ( [ eq : flrw ] ) .",
    "a geodesic curve @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the affine parameter , satisfies , in a coordinate system , the following equation @xcite    [ eq : geoeq ] + ^_=0  , where @xmath21 are the christoffel symbols of the spacetime metric @xmath22 .",
    "this way , the geodesic equations ( [ eq : geoeq ] ) become + ha^2_ij=0 , [ tgeodesic ] + + 2h=0  .[xgeodesic ] . by using @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ xgeodesic ] ) can be rewritten as follows ( a^2)=0  , which after integrated turns out =  , where @xmath24 are integration constants .",
    "then , using the above result , eq .",
    "( [ tgeodesic ] ) yields ( ) ^2=+c_0  , where @xmath25 is another integration constant .",
    "we thus see that the geodesics will be regular ( with a well defined tangent vector ) as long as the scale factor remains regular .",
    "hence , whether the scale factor does not diverge and is non - vanishing ( so the metric is regular ) , the 4-velocities of the geodesics remain regular and the spacetime will be said to be non - singular .",
    "if the scale factor diverges at some point , then the geodesics stop there and can not go through it . as we have discussed above ,",
    "it is important to notice that the geodesics are insensitive to divergences in the expansion rate @xmath26 or its derivatives if they do not correspond to a singular behavior of the scale factor .",
    "this will be the case of the types ii , iii and iv singularities below , where the scale factor remains finite while all the divergences only appear in its derivatives .",
    "when any geodesic path can not be indefinitely extended , one would be interested on knowing what is the reason for being so .",
    "however , the theorems on spacetime singularities give precise conditions under which the emergence of a singularity is unavoidable , but tell us very little about _ what _ a singularity is . taking into account that in many spacetimes their geodesically incomplete character comes alongside the divergence of ( some ) curvature scalars , one might blame the presence of infinitely large tidal forces for the existence of incomplete paths .",
    "therefore , a framework has been developed to determine the impact of tidal forces upon physical ( extended ) observers @xcite , establishing the criteria of _ strong _ singularities if the body is unavoidable destroyed as it crosses the divergent region , and _ weak _ in case it could retain its identity .",
    "those criteria are based on the convergence of the following integrals :    t(u)&&_0^d _ 0^ dr_iju^i u^j , + k(u)&&_0^d ",
    "r_iju^i u^j .",
    "where @xmath27 is the 4-velocity of the geodesic towards the singularity and @xmath28 the components of the ricci tensor . from these expressions",
    "it is clear that a spacetime containing a divergence in ( some of ) the curvature scalars can still be regular according to the above criteria .",
    "equipped with the two tools above ( geodesic completeness and weak / strong singularities ) , a number of future singularities have been found and studied in detail in the literature :    * type i (  big rip singularity \" ) : for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "this case yields incomplete null and time - like geodesics @xcite .",
    "thus it represents a genuine space - time singularity . *",
    "type ii (  sudden singularity \" ) : for @xmath29 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "geodesics are complete and observers are not necessarily crushed ( weak singularity @xcite ) . *",
    "type iii (  big freeze singularity \" ) : for @xmath29 , @xmath33 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "geodesically complete solutions , which can be either strong or weak @xcite * type iv (  generalized sudden singularity \" ) : for @xmath29 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath36 but second and higher derivatives of the hubble parameter @xmath26 diverge .",
    "geodesics are complete and the singularity is weak @xcite . *",
    "type v (  @xmath16-singularity \" ) : for @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 but the equation of state @xmath39 .",
    "these singularities are weak as well @xcite .",
    "this list summarizes the current knowledge on spacetime singularities in the literature , where the divergent quantities are identified .",
    "in this section we shall further specify the setup discussed in the previous section and assume that matter is given by two interacting sources , non - relativistic dark matter , with a dust - like eos , @xmath40 , and dark energy , whose eos , @xmath41 , can be , in principle , a function of time .",
    "the interactions between the two dark sectors can be parameterized as @xcite    @xmath42    where the @xmath43-vector @xmath44 , which governs the stress - energy transfer between the two dark components , can be chosen to be parallel to the dark matter one , @xmath45 , or to the dark energy one @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the four velocity of each component .",
    "regardless of the choice , from the biachi identities one obtains the same continuity equations , which read @xcite    @xmath48    and which is nothing but the field equations of the matter sector . in these equations",
    "@xmath49 accounts for the energy exchange rate between the two dark sectors , in such a way that @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) implies a transfer of energy from the dark matter sector to the dark energy one ( and the other way round ) .",

    "we are interested in knowing under which circumstances this interacting term yields future singularities on the cosmological background evolution . to this end",
    "we shall split our analysis into constant and time - dependent eos for the dark energy component .",
    "this choice removes the @xmath57 contribution in eq.([eqbis2 ] ) .",
    "let us parameterize the hubble factor as    [ eq : paramh ] h(t)=a++b(t_s - t)^  , where @xmath58 and @xmath59 are some constants , and the index @xmath60 controls the type of singularity at the time @xmath15 .",
    "note that such parameterisation is assumed in such a way that matter dominated epoch is recovered asymptotically while at late - times the cosmological constant term should dominated together with the last term in ( [ eq : paramh ] ) , which denotes deviations from @xmath61cdm model .",
    "for the appropriate value of @xmath62 , the last term will eventually dominate when approaching the singularity if occurs . from the parametrization ( [ eq : paramh ] ) one obtains the dominant term for the scale factor @xmath3 as    a(t)=a_0t^2/3 e^  , if @xmath63 and    a(t)=a_0t^2/3 e^[at - log(t_s - t ) ]  , if @xmath64 . in these expressions",
    "@xmath65 is an integration constant . on the other hand , the expansion of the factor @xmath49 in ( [ eqbis2 ] ) at @xmath18 with the parametrization ( [ eq : paramh ] ) yields a dominant term    q(t ) ( t - t_s)^-2  , which implies its divergence for @xmath66 . to proceed",

    "the analysis above shows that the four classes of future singularities introduced by nojiri , odintsov and tsujikawa in ref.@xcite can be understood to be just particular cases of singularities of the function @xmath49 at @xmath18 , where each type of divergence on the scale / hubble factor or its derivatives comes from a different degree of divergence of @xmath49 . in this sense , if @xmath80 the function @xmath49 is finite and no future singularity emerges .      next we will extend our analysis to a non - constant dark energy eos .",

    "if @xmath89 then the term @xmath84 yields a finite contribution to @xmath49 in eq.([eqbis2 ] ) .",
    "in such a case one would need to consider the behaviour of the other terms in eq.([eqbis2 ] ) , thus obtaining again the types i - iv of singularities above .    from the analysis above it is clear that the known five type of future singularities ( and the new type vi found here ) can be seen just as particular cases of the divergence of the energy flow between the dark components , that is , _",
    "@xmath0-singularities_. in the next section we shall review some particular interacting models and discuss their relation with @xmath0-singularities .",
    "over the last years , couplings among dark energy and dark matter have been widely explored in the literature .",
    "naturally , the effective @xmath0-term is usually considered to be proportional to the energy density , either the dark matter / energy density or a combination of both , i.e. ( see e.g. @xcite ) q = h  , [ 4.1 ] where @xmath90 is a constant to be determined by the observations .",
    "then , let us explore the possibility of the existence of a @xmath0-singularity when considering this type of interactions .",
    "firstly , we analyze the case when the interacting term is proportional to the dark energy density , @xmath91 .",
    "in such a case , by combining the flrw equations ( [ eq : fried ] ) , the interacting term @xmath0 can be expressed as follows : q =- h  .",

    "in addition , by combining expressions ( [ eqbis2 ] ) and ( [ 4.2 ] ) , the following equation for the hubble parameter is obtained : & & 2 + 9(1+w_de)h^3 + 6(2+w_de)h + & - & ( 3 h^2 + 2 ) + h(3h^2 + 2)=0  .

    ", the ocurrence of a future singularity is associated to the kind of eos for the dark energy fluid , @xmath93 . in order to illustrate the cosmological evolution for this case ,",
    "let us define the following dimensionless variables : h(t)=  , x = t / t_0  .",
    "[ 4.4 ] here @xmath94 is the age of the universe . while the @xmath0-term can be redefined as : q=  .",
    "[ 4.4a ] for simplicity , we are assuming a constant eos parameter @xmath93 .",

    "along this manuscript , we have revisited the so - called interacting dark energy models , where a coupling among dark matter and dark energy is assumed . following previous literature ,",
    "the interacting term is described directly through the energy conservation equations in such a way that the total energy is obviously conserved but a flow among both dark components exists .",
    "then , once an interaction is assumed , one finds that every future singularity is just a consequence of a more general one , what we have called @xmath0-singularity .",
    "this means that the energy flow diverges at finite time , inducing naturally one of the so - called future singularities studied in the literature so far .",
    "in addition , besides the well known singularities listed in section [ sec : ii ] , we found a new type , also induced by the divergence of the interacting @xmath0-term , where now the infinity lies on the first derivative of the eos parameter for dark energy .",
    "in addition , we have also investigated the possible occurrence of such a singularity when assuming some interacting terms proportional to the energy density , models that have been revealed to reproduce late - time acceleration @xcite .",
    "hence , we have found that , independently of the form of @xmath0 , a singularity only occurs when the eos parameter @xmath99 .",
    "however , whether the interacting term is proportional to the dark energy density and the flow towards dark matter is large enough , a future singularity can be avoided even in the case where @xmath99 .",
    "hence , as a conclusion of this paper , we can say that whether the dark components of the universe interact with each other , every future singularity has the same origin , that is the @xmath0-singularity .",
