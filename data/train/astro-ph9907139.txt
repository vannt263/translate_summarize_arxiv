    "richards argued that if the submm dust sources had cm - radio detections , then they must be either @xmath48 star - forming galaxies or , if at higher redshift , heated by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . to clarify these issues , it is important to obtain good positions for the dust sources by millimeter interferometry to examine possible coincidences with the hubble deep field optical galaxies and vla radio sources .",

    "because the 1.3 mm flux density of hdf 850.1 is close to the minimum detectable level in a 10-hr integration at this wavelength , this strongest source in the scuba survey may be the _ only _ source in the hubble deep field that can be detected at present in reasonable observing times with millimeter interferometers . to measure more accurately the position of this source , we observed it at 1.3 mm and 3 mm with the iram interferometer on plateau de bure , france",
    "the observations were made at 1.3 mm and 3 mm simultaneously , in the interferometer s compact configuration d on november 17 and 22 , 1998 , and in the more extended configuration c2 on december 15 , 16 , and 17 , 1998 .",

    "flux densities were calibrated with 3c273 and mwc349 , for which we adopted the following values : for 3c273 , 11jy at 1.3 mm and 18jy at 3.4 mm ; for mwc349 , 1.7jy at 1.3 mm and 0.9jy at 3.4 mm .",

    "positional uncertainties of 0.7@xmath59 in each coordinate .",
    "the interferometer position differs from the scuba position at the 3.6@xmath39 level , indicating that there may have been an unsuspected systematic error in the scuba positions , which in turn may affect some of the other submm / optical associations suggested by hughes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) .",
    "the source is too weak to measure an angular size . in the maps from the longer - baseline c2 configuration alone , the flux at the source position is @xmath60mjy , so the source may be partially resolved .",

    "* ) agree with sizes ranging from 1.7@xmath59 to a point source .",
    "what size should we expect ?",
    "since we observe mm / submm dust radiation , the source can not be very hot .",
    "for example , a circular source at @xmath1 ( see below)mpc@xmath62 and @xmath63 in this paper . ] with a dust temperature of 35k , which has a dust opacity of unity at an emitted wavelength of 100@xmath3 m , would yield a flux of 2.2mjy at an observed wavelength of 1.3 mm if its diameter were 0.3@xmath59",
    ". a less opaque source would be even larger .",
    "no source was detected at either 2.8 mm ( 105.7ghz ) or at 3.4 mm ( 88.7ghz ) , to @xmath64 limits of 0.5mjy and 0.4mjy respectively ( * fig .  2 * ) .",
    "this is consistent with the 1.3 mm continuum being optically thin emission by dust . for a typical dust continuum spectral index of 3.5 ,",
    "the expected fluxes of hdf 850.1 would be only 0.13mjy at 2.8 mm and 0.07mjy at 3.4 mm .",
    "although our main goal was the detection of dust emission at 1.3 mm , we chose the frequency in the upper sideband , 237.824ghz , to coincide with the co(98 ) line at @xmath7 = 3.36 , the tentative redshift assigned by zepf , moustakas , & davis ( 1997 ) to the optical source 3 - 577.0 located 1.4@xmath59 east of the @xmath2 elliptical galaxy 3 - 586.0 .",

    "later on , we tuned the 3 mm receivers to 88.738ghz to search for the co(10 ) line at @xmath7 = 0.299 , the redshift of the bright disk galaxy , 3 - 659.1 , located 10@xmath59 to the southwest of hdf 850.1 . in velocity channels 34  wide",

    "the milky way has a 10 line luminosity of @xmath68kpc@xmath69 inside the solar circle ( rivolo & solomon 1988 ) , so at @xmath70 , the milky way would have a 10 line flux of 0.05jy .",
    "we estimate the r.m.s .  positional uncertainty to be 0.3@xmath59 for the centroid of the 1.3 mm dust source .",
    "this limit is set by the baseline accuracy of the interferometer , the availability of phase calibrators in this part of the sky , the signal to noise ratio , and the seeing .",
    "thus far , the best astrometry done with the interferometer was for the source w3(oh ) , with phases calibrated on the quasar 0224 + 671 , located 5@xmath71 away . in those projects ( wink et al . 1994 ; wyrowski et al . 1997 ; 1999 ) , the global statistical positional repeatability was 0.05@xmath59 r.m.s . , including the systematic errors in the baseline geometry . to this must be added the @xmath72 uncertainty in the jodrell bank ",

    "1992 ) .    to reduce errors",
    ", we chose the three phase calibrators at earlier and later right ascensions , and lower and higher declinations than the hubble deep field ( * table  1 * ) .",
    "this should formally reduce the noise in the baseline errors and in our weighted average of calibrators by a factor @xmath74 to @xmath75 . to check internal consistency of the reduction software , we made maps of the calibrator sources , and on the maps , the position errors were @xmath76 .",
    "the uncertainties in their measured cm - radio positions from the jodrell - vla survey are ten times lower ( * table  1 * ) .",
    "two of the calibrators are weak , @xmath77jy at 1.3 mm , but their signal - to - noise ratio is quite satisfactory at 3 mm . because we subtract the scaled 3 mm phase fluctuations from those at 1.3 mm , we can improve the fit of the phase solution at 1.3 mm , but there remains a residual instrumental phase error , which brings the astrometric part of the position error to 0.2@xmath59 r.m.s .",
    "in addition to the astrometric error , there is a statistical error related to the signal - to - noise ratio . for a point source ,",
    "this position error due to noise is @xmath78 where @xmath79 is the synthesized beam , and @xmath80 is the signal - to - noise ratio . for our map in configurations d + c2 , the beam @xmath79 is @xmath81 , and the signal - to - noise ratio is @xmath80 = 7 , so the position error due to noise is @xmath82 r.m.s .",
    "the convolution of the astrometric error ( 0.2@xmath59 ) , and the noise error ( 0.2@xmath59 ) then gives a root sum square error of 0.3@xmath59 .",
    "the identification of the 1.3 mm dust source with an optical galaxy or a cm - radio source in the hubble deep field depends strongly on the accuracy of the measured positions .",

    "( 1998 ) tentatively associated the vla source 3651 + 1221 with the @xmath188 galaxy 3 - 659.1 ( cf . *",
    "fig .  4 * )",
    ". this galaxy may also be the 15@xmath3 m source hdf_pm3_29 detected with isocam ( aussel et al .",
    "richards ( 1999 ) showed however that the radio emission is confined to the faint emission north of the spiral , about @xmath193 south of the optical object 3 - 633.1 , which has a photometric redshift of 1.72 ( fernndez - soto et al . 1999 ) .",
    "since then , this optical object has been detected in @xmath142 and @xmath194 bands , having colors consistent with a high-@xmath7 galaxy ( dickinson 1998 ) .",
    "richards ( 1999 ) noted that if the radio source is at @xmath135 , the implied radio luminosity is substantially higher than that of the most extreme local starbursts like arp  220 , which suggests the radio source may be an agn .",
    "there is a 3-sigma contour near the spiral galaxy on the iram 1.3 mm map ( * fig .  4 * ) , which we list in * table  1 * as a questionable source .",
    "the 1.3 mm position is 1@xmath59 south of the vla source .",
    "the apparent 1.3 mm flux density is 0.75mjy , but this would have to be corrected for the primary beam attenuation to @xmath195mjy if the source were real . in this case",
    ", the emission could not be the extrapolation of the synchrotron spectrum from centimeter wavelengths , because the flux density at 3.4 cm is only 16@xmath3jy ( richards et al .",
    "could it be dust emission from the spiral ?",
    "the problem with dust emission at low redshifts ( @xmath196 ) is that most of the energy is at shorter wavelengths , not redshifted into the mm /submm bands .",
    "the dust in the central parts of the milky way , or in ngc 891 , corresponding to a molecular gas mass of @xmath112 , would yield a 1.3 mm flux of only 68@xmath3jy at @xmath197 , or @xmath198 times lower than the apparent flux on the 1.3 mm map . the apparent 3@xmath39 signal would thus have to come from an extremely gas - rich galaxy , which is not in any way indicated by the hst optical image of this relatively nearby object .",
    "since there is also a 3@xmath39 negative peak at a similar radius from the center of the primary beam ( * fig .  1 * ) , the apparent 3@xmath39 positive signal may not be real .",
