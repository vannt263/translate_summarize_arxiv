    "the existence of dark matter ( dm ) in the universe is commonly accepted as the explanation of many experimental phenomena in astrophysics and cosmology ( for a recent review see @xcite ) . within the standard model of cosmology the data collected by the planck collaboration @xcite imply that dm constitutes around 80@xmath4 of the total matter content of the universe .",
    "the new dm objects should be massive , should not carry an electric charge and could weakly interact with the common matter .",
    "dm particles are predicted by numerous bsm models , such as , for instance the @xmath5-parity conserving supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "a review of these models can be found in @xcite .",
    "if non - gravitational interactions between dm and sm particles exist these hypothetical particles could be produced at hadron colliders . despite an intensive experimental efforts the dark matter searches",
    "so far have been unsuccessful .",
    "not surprisingly , the search for dm is one of the main objectives of the lhc physics program since the dm particles could appear in proton - proton @xmath6 collisions .",
    "dm particles on their own would not leave a detectable signal in the lhc detectors , but when produced in association with a visible sm particle @xmath7 ( which may be a @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) they would provide event topologies with a transverse momentum _",
    "imbalance_. a large missing transverse energy @xmath10 will be then observable in the detector .",
    "so far no signs of dark matter particles have been observed in particle physics experiments , and currently at the lhc only new constraints on the parameter spaces of the theoretical models have been set .",
    "however , in some scenarios the missing @xmath10 may be not large .",
    "in particular , this may be the case when the invisible object is produced via photon - photon fusion , see , for example @xcite .",
    "here we discuss the possibility of searching for such invisible objects in exclusive events pp",
    "p+invisible+p , where the missing @xmath10 is relatively small , by studying the missing - mass distribution with respect to the two outgoing forward protons . in other words , to search for exclusive events with missing longitudinal energy .",
    "the serious problem is that the lhc detectors are not ` hermetic ' . as a consequence ,",
    "there is a large probability that the events have secondaries with large rapidities that escape detection and so carry away the corresponding longitudinal energy .",
    "since the missing - mass signal is obtained by observing only the forward protons , and not observing the vertex in the central detector , we have no possibility of excluding a ` background ' pile - up event .",
    "in particular , in the same bunch crossing we may detect a proton coming from a single diffractive right beam dissociation and another leading proton from another event with a left beam dissociation .",
    "the cross section of low - mass dissociation measured by totem at @xmath11 tev is @xmath12 mb  @xcite .",
    "that is , the probability of one side dissociation is of the order of  ~   ~  1% . at high lhc luminosity ,",
    "when the mean number of interactions in each bunch crossing is about @xmath13 we will observe such a ` wrong ' configuration ( two leading protons from two different events ) in typically each fourth bunch crossing .",
    "for this reason it looks better to work at lower luminosities , when @xmath14 , using , for example , the alice detector .",
    "anyway , we have no chance to observe more than one ` invisible ' event per bunch crossing .",
    "this means that the lowest ` invisible ' cross section that we can discuss is of the order of [ sig ] _",
    "min  ~  _ tot ( )  ~   100  ( )  ~  0.25  , here @xmath15 is the bunch - bunch spacing and @xmath16 is the time of the lhc run .",
    "for @xmath14 the ratio @xmath17 is the total number of @xmath18 collisions .",
    "recall that the cross section of low - mass dissociation is of the order of 1 mb ( where we have a leading proton with the momentum fraction @xmath19 , but no secondaries in the central detector ( or calorimeters ) ) .",
    "the corresponding cross section of double low - mass dissociation ( both protons ) is about 0.1 - 0.2 mb ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "this is in accordance with the factorization relation [ eq : fact ] ^dd=  . inserting @xmath20 mb and @xmath21 mb in ( [ eq : fact ] )",
    ", we would expect @xmath22 mb .",
    "however it is known that the exact factorization relation is violated by the different @xmath23-behaviour of the cross sections and the different gap survival probabilities ( see , for example ,  @xcite for details ) . in particular , at 7 tev in the mass interval @xmath24 gev , the ratio is observed to be @xmath25  @xcite and not 1 . that is , we expect @xmath26 to be about 4 times larger , @xmath27 mb , than that given by ( [ eq : fact ] ) . to reach an acceptable signal - to - background ratio , @xmath28 , we therefore must suppress such dissociation of both the left and right outgoing protons by about 6 orders of magnitude . assuming a factor 4@xmath2910 violation of the factorization prediction we conclude that in order to have an ` acceptable ' background dissociation , the value of @xmath30 should be reduced down to a few nb .",
    "there is a probability of having two events in one bunch crossing and to produce two leading protons from two different events , but this probability will be less than the probability of the event coming from ` double dissociation ' . ]      in this paper we estimate whether it is possible that lhc detectors can obtain the necessary suppression of the background to identify an invisible signal of cross section of the order of 0.25 fb , see ( [ sig ] ) .",
    "the major channels of low - mass proton dissociation are the formation of the nucleon resonances , like @xmath31 ( with the same spin , parity as the proton ) , and the group of resonances in 1700 mev mass region ( see e.g. sect.6.2 of  @xcite ) , with dominant decays into the @xmath32 and @xmath33 states .",
    "section  [ sec : s2 ] is devoted to the background arising from the decays @xmath34 charged neutral final states .",
    "in section  [ sec:22 ] we consider the possibility of the zero degree calorimeter ( zdc ) ( for example  @xcite for alice ) observing the @xmath35 from @xmath36 decay .",
    "in addition , in section  [ sec:21 ] we discuss photon bremsstrahlung ( @xmath37 ) , which also may produce a leading proton with not too small cross section ( see  @xcite ) , and in section  [ sec:23 ] we study the radiative @xmath38 decays which have sizeable branching ratios ( in particular , br@xmath39% , br@xmath40%  @xcite ) .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec:24 ] we evaluate the contribution of the so - called drell - hiida - deck diagram  @xcite , but this contribution is much smaller . in section  [ sec : s3 ]",
    "we estimate the chance of vetoing the charged pions from @xmath41 decay with forward shower counters ( fsc ) @xcite ( and ada and adc of alice  @xcite ) .",
    "we do not consider here other background processes ( like central exclusive production of zz - boson pairs with their subsequent decay to four neutrinos , or other sm reactions with neutrinos and charged leptons or photons which for some reason were not observed in central detector ) .",
    "these processes have a much smaller cross section ( see e.g.  @xcite ) than those for proton dissociation .",
    "there could be another source of background caused by beam halo particles .",
    "it depends on the details of the beam optics and we will not consider it .",
    "in section  [ sec : s4 ] we consider the possibility of identifying other particles by missing mass signals .",
    "we discuss the ` compressed mass bsm ' scenario . in this case",
    "the process is not completely invisible but contains relatively low @xmath10 jets or leptons which will be difficult to distinguish from the sm background in usual inclusive events .",
    "all the numerical estimates are done for the initial proton - proton energy @xmath42 tev assuming that the leading protons with the momentum fraction , @xmath43 are detected within the interval @xmath44   and @xmath45 for the roman pot forward detectors at the lhc . ] .",
    "there is a chance that a larger @xmath43 interval may be covered at the lhc using the beam line monitor ( blm ) system as the forward proton detector @xcite .",
    "this method is complimentary to the present experimental installations for forward proton detection ( totem , alpha , ct - pps , afp ) .",
    "it would allow the experiment to greatly increase the missing mass coverage in central exclusive processes .",
    "recall , that the conventional detection system , based on the roman pot detectors , is limited by the locations of the pots and the allowed transversal approach to the beam , see @xcite . on other hand , in the central production process",
    ", @xmath46 , a final state proton , which exits the lhc beam vacuum chamber at locations determined by its fractional momentum loss , may be detected by the blm system .",
    "in this way its momentum will be measured .",
    "that is , the blm system will act as a forward proton detector  @xcite .",
    "however , at the moment , we consider the acceptance of the present roman pot detectors .",
    "in this section we consider the background to the invisible signal coming from the forward proton decays @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "these are , respectively , the subjects of subsections [ sec:21 ] , [ sec:23 ] and [ sec:22 ] below . such backgrounds may be rejected by an appropriate zero degree detector .",
    "we start from the simplest process of photon bremsstrahlung of the proton . the probability to radiate a photon during elastic @xmath18 scattering",
    "is suppressed by the qed coupling @xmath50 . however , in comparison with a 1 fb cross section from a possible bsm signal , or from the cross section of single dissociation @xmath51 nb allowed for the background processes of interest , the bremsstrahlung background is quite large .",
    "recall that it is proportional the elastic @xmath18 cross section of 25 mb .",
    "to make a numerical estimate we use the formula from  @xcite supplemented by the nucleon form factor f_n=(1+)^-2 at each @xmath52 vertex , which accounts for the off - shellness ( @xmath53 ) of the intermediate proton .",
    "here we use the usual dipole form of this form factor .",
    "a more detail discussion of the @xmath54 reaction can be found in  @xcite , where it was shown that some other mechanisms of dissociation into @xmath55 give smaller cross sections and are less important .    as seen from the dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] there is rather large bremsstrahlung at relatively large angles ( more than 0.3 mrad )  .",
    "that is , in the rapidity region ( @xmath56 ) not fully covered by the present zdcs . from this undetected region",
    "we collect up to 1 @xmath57b . to suppress this cross section down to 1 nb an enlargement of the zdc coverage by a factor of about 4 will be needed ; that is , up to 1.2 mrad ( corresponding to @xmath58 ) .",
    "[ h ]      an even stronger neutral background arises from @xmath35 production .",
    "here there is no suppression due to the small qed coupling .",
    "moreover , after the subsequent @xmath59 decay the final photons may be emitted at relatively large angles ( see the heavy solid curve in fig .  [",
    "fig : f1 ] which was calculated for @xmath60=1.9 gev )   dissociation was calculated in  @xcite . however , in this paper the kinematics of the final @xmath61 decay was not considered . ] . on the other hand , to exclude such events it may be sufficient to observe only one of the two high energy photons .",
    "that is , first , we have to be sure that the probability for both photons to miss the zdc detector is negligibly small .",
    "the production and decay of @xmath62 resonances in the 1440@xmath291900 mass region may be responsible for about 50% of the low - mass proton dissociation .",
    "the probability of their decay to @xmath63 channel is about 20@xmath2925% .",
    "so , this channel has a cross section @xmath64 mb .",
    "we assume the simplified case where the angular and momentum distributions are driven only by the phase space corresponding to the @xmath65 decay .",
    "in addition to the angular distribution of the final photons generated by the @xmath59 decay kinematics , we have to account for the non - zero momentum transferred in the initial @xmath66 dissociation . at present",
    "there are no lhc data on the @xmath23 distribution in low - mass dissociation .",
    "the only preliminary experimental observation is the @xmath23-slope @xmath67 gev@xmath68 measured by totem  @xcite for the @xmath24 gev mass interval .",
    "so , here we assume a slope @xmath69 gev@xmath68 .",
    "next , we assume that the leading protons are detected within the @xmath70 interval .",
    "the expected pseudorapidity distribution of the final photons is shown in fig.1 .",
    "the worst situation is when both photons from the @xmath35 decay are emitted at angles larger than that covered by zdc .",
    "to avoid such a possibility the calorimeter must cover at least the @xmath71 mrad interval ; then the cross section not vetoed by the zdc is less than 1 nb for any @xmath72 gev . for a smaller coverage of , say , @xmath731.2 mrad we have , at a mean @xmath74 of 2.2 gev , a cross section up to 0.3 @xmath57b for events where both photons are missed by the zdc .",
    "next there is about 3% probability that only one photon will be missed and that the other will go into the angular interval ( @xmath75 mrad ) covered by zdc .",
    "( it will reduce to 1.4% probability in the case of a larger @xmath732 mrad coverage when there is more chance to detect both photons . )",
    "a computation shows that this 3% corresponds to a cross section of @xmath30=100 nb . to suppress the background down to 1 nb we need factor 10@xmath76 .",
    "that is , this photon must be observed with the efficiency better than 99% ; in other words , the calorimeter should have more than 5 radiation lengths .    note that with the @xmath73 1.5 mrad coverage the probability to observe both photons from @xmath35 decay in the zdc is significant ( more than 10% ) .",
    "so , it will be possible to check experimentally the contribution of each particular nucleon resonance .",
    "recall that the radiative @xmath38 decays have non - negligible branchings .",
    "in particular , br@xmath39% , br@xmath40%  @xcite .",
    "that is , we start from the cross sections of about 1 @xmath57b . for the @xmath38",
    "decays the probability to miss the photon ( with the @xmath73 1.5 mrad coverage of the zdc ) is practically negligible for @xmath72 gev . for larger masses the probability of two - particle decay decreases .",
    "thus , even with some probability to miss a photon ( e.g. the probability is about 1.5@xmath4 for @xmath77 gev ) the background from the radiative decay of a ` heavy ' nucleon resonance , @xmath78 , is not a problem . on the other hand , multiparticle decay modes which contain additional secondaries",
    "will be easier to veto by observing at least one of the extra particles .",
    "however , we still need a good efficiency to detect a single energetic photon in the zdc . if the mean @xmath79 gev then we require a suppression of about 200 .",
    "thus , again , the calorimeter should have more than 5 - 5.5 radiation lengths .",
    "another possible background arises from the drell - hiida - deck diagram  @xcite , in which the emission of a @xmath35 from a proton is followed by elastic @xmath80 scattering .",
    "however , the cross section is small in the @xmath44 interval .",
    "if we assume @xmath81 mb , an elastic @xmath82 slope of @xmath83 gev@xmath68 and @xmath84 , then the cross section is about 1 nb , which is negligible .",
    "now we are concerned with the detection of forward going charged pions .",
    "as before we assume the unpolarized decay which is driven just by the phase volume available for the decay , and that the @xmath23-slope of proton dissociation is @xmath69 gev@xmath68 .",
    "we calculate the probability to observe one or both charged pions within the forward _ rapidity _ interval in the events with the momentum fraction of both leading protons in the interval @xmath44 .",
    "moreover , motivated by the triple - regge analysis of  @xcite , we assume a mass distribution of the form m^2_x  1 + . given by the triple - regge ppp and ppr terms ( where p and r denote a pomeron , and a secondary reggeon respectively ) .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : f2 ] , the ` veto ' detector must cover the _ rapidity _ interval from 5.5 to 9.5 .",
    "next , it is important to have extremely low cuts ( in the 10 mev range ) on the minimum pion transverse momentum , @xmath86 . already with the cut @xmath87 mev we have up to 0.5@xmath4 ( inadmissible ) probability to miss both pions from the decay of a @xmath88 gev system . without a @xmath89 cut ,",
    "the probability that both pions will have the rapidity outside the @xmath90 interval is negligible ( less than @xmath91 ) . on the other hand",
    "the probability to miss one pion from the decay of a @xmath92 gev system observing the @xmath90 rapidity interval is small , about 1.2@xmath93 .",
    "that is , to reach the required cross section we have to suppress this background 100 times .",
    "this should be possible ; @xmath94 radiation length is needed .",
    "the problem , however , is that here we are dealing with charged particles whose trajectories are affected by the magnetic field . thus a detailed detector simulation is needed to confirm the efficiency of the ` veto ' .    [ h ]",
    "nowadays a lot of attention is paid to bsm models where new particles are nearly degenerate in mass .",
    "such a mass spectrum is often referred to as ` compressed ' .",
    "compressed spectra can arise for example in natural susy , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the present lack of evidence for susy at the lhc makes it attractive to study the compressed scenario when , in a lhc collision , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , often assumed to be neutralino , is close in mass to the parent sparticle ( e.g. chargino ) .",
    "the neutralino in turn would provide a viable dm candidate .",
    "for instance , as pointed out in e.g. @xcite , light higgsinos could have a compressed mass spectrum resulting in an experimental signature with comparatively soft leptons ( or jets ) and missing energy .",
    "if the momentum of a visible sm probe ( e.g. charged lepton ) in the decay of the second - to - lightest object is sufficiently small , the compressed - mass class of theoretical models becomes very challenging for typical susy searches at the lhc , because of the trigger requirements and the difficulty to distinguish experimentally the signal from the sm backgrounds .",
    "[ h ]    therefore , here , we study a special situation where the new secondaries produced in the event are not completely invisible , but decay into a heavy invisible particle plus a relatively ` soft ' lepton or minijet . as an example it may be a chargino - pair produced via the photon - photon fusion , in which both charginos decay into the invisible lsp , and a @xmath95 , plus a charged lepton detected with @xmath96 gev , see fig .  [ fig : f3](a ) .",
    "in such a case the missing transverse energy is rather low , while the lsp - pair carries away large longitudinal energy .",
    "unfortunately again we have to work at ` low ' luminosity with @xmath14 .",
    "the problem is that even with good timing , when we can identify the vertex in central detector which corresponds to the observed leading protons , we can not be sure that we know if the energy has been carried away by the @xmath35  the calorimeter is unable to identify the vertex of emission with sufficient accuracy .",
    "next , we have to check that this was the prompt leading proton and not a proton from @xmath62 decay .",
    "that is we need a veto for the production of high rapidity pions or photons .",
    "there are two problems .",
    "first , we have to suppress the sm background .",
    "second , in order to know the missing longitudinal energy caused by some bsm process , we have to be sure that this fraction of the proton momentum was not carried away by an unobserved pion , photon or other sm secondary .",
    "however , for the compressed scenario , the required suppression of the background is not so strong .",
    "indeed , the main backgrounds are ( i ) the qed production of a lepton ( or minijet ) pair , ( ii ) production of a @xmath97-pair with the decay to low @xmath86 leptons , see figs .",
    "[ fig : f3](b ) and ( c ) respectively",
    ". finally there may be central exclusive production ( cep ) of the pair of @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) mesons following by the decays , like @xmath100 , with the low energy neutral pion not observed in the central detector .",
    "the expected exclusive cross sections are about 6 ( 0.7 ) pb for the pair of muons with @xmath101 gev and about 70 fb for @xmath97-pair production  @xcite . the exclusive @xmath98 cross section may be estimated based on the formulae for the charm quark pair production from sect.3 of  @xcite .",
    "it is of the order of 1 nb .",
    "the cross section of analogous processes with the proton dissociation can be roughly evaluated based on the factorization relations .",
    "= [ fact1 ]  . in hard processes , here , we assume the same probability of dissociation as that in soft ( quasi elastic ) interactions .    strictly speaking such factorization relations are violated due to the different @xmath23-dependences and gap survival probabilities ( see e.g.  @xcite for details ) . in particular , at 7 tev the ratio @xmath25  @xcite and not 1 . on the other hand ,",
    "the violation of ( [ eq : fact ] ) is not large ( less than factor of 10 ) .",
    "so , the possibility of proton dissociation does not enlarge the final cross section more than a few times .",
    "thus to reduce the background down to 1 fb we have to suppress the @xmath97 background about 100 times . recall that we select events with a relatively low @xmath102 gev , while the typical @xmath86 in w decay is about @xmath103 gev",
    "the probability to have so low @xmath86 for _ both _ w decays is of about @xmath104% .",
    "that is the expected @xmath97 background is less than 1 fb , without any additional selection .    in the case of a background caused by lepton pairs , an additional factor @xmath105 ( 700 for @xmath106 gev ) suppression is required .",
    "however we can select the events with the different lepton flavours , such as @xmath107 and @xmath108 .",
    "this will eliminate the purely qed background .",
    "unfortunately such @xmath107 and @xmath108 pairs could result from the @xmath98 ( or @xmath99 ) decays .",
    "most dangerous are the decays @xmath109 ( with branching ratio of @xmath110 ) , @xmath111 ( with branching ratio of @xmath112 ) and @xmath113 ( with combined branching ratio of @xmath114  @xcite ) ; and the similar decays with the @xmath115 replaced by @xmath57 .",
    "that is we deal with the cross sections of the order of hundreds fb which must be suppressed more than 100 times .",
    "meson decays are much smaller : br@xmath116 , br@xmath117 and br@xmath118  @xcite .",
    "thus the @xmath119 mesons will not cause any serious problem .",
    "moreover such events may be rejected since the vertex of the @xmath119 decay can be identified in the central detector . ]",
    "since the mass of the @xmath98 pair is much less than the mass of the bsm objects that we are looking for , the corresponding suppression can be reached via the resolution of the forward proton detectors .",
    "the resolution must be sufficient to distinguish the mass of @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) systems ( of the order of 10 - 30 gev ) and the heavy object mass ( larger than few hundreds gev ) .",
    "recall that actually the forward proton detectors ( fpd ) measure the proton momentum fractions @xmath120 and @xmath121 ; that is , they determine the mass @xmath122 and the rapidity @xmath123 of the central system .",
    "thus each individual fpd should provide a suppression of more than a factor of @xmath124 .",
    "this looks realistic . the only problem is to be sure that the signal was not washed out by proton dissociation . in other words",
    "we have to check that    * there are no other high rapidity unobserved pions or photons which may carry away the corresponding energy .",
    "this can be done with the help of the zdc calorimeters and forward shower counters , as was described above . however , now we do not need the factor @xmath125 suppression in each outgoing proton direction , but instead a suppression of only about 10 times .",
    "this does not look at all pessimistic .",
    "indeed , it may be done with the present detectors . *",
    "the resolution of the forward proton detectors must provide the possibility to distinguish an event with a central system of mass , @xmath126 , of about 20 gev from that of @xmath127 gev , despite the fact that low - mass contribution is 100 times larger . recall that we will also have to check the value of rapidity of the central system",
    "that is , each forward proton detector should provide more then factor of 10 suppression .",
    "this also looks quite realistic . *",
    "final problem is the trigger",
    ". it might be difficult to organize the level-1 trigger at high luminosities without the detection of large @xmath10 particles .",
    "however , as we said from the beginning , in our approach we have to work at relatively low luminosity with a mean number of interactions @xmath14 per bunch crossing . in this case",
    "it may be sufficient to select low multiplicity events ( in the central detector ) with a lepton of @xmath128 gev in coincidence with the two leading protons .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the blm - based approach of @xcite could open a way to test the models of dark matter , where the mass splitting between the dark matter particle and its charged ( co - annihilation ) partner is so small that the co - annihilation partners become long - lived ( stable or meta - stable ) at collider scales , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "then the final state to be observed is two forward protons plus two anomalous charged tracks .",
    "we have investigated the possibility of searching for a heavy invisible ( bsm ) object using the forward proton detectors ; that is observing events with just forward protons and a large missing _",
    "longitudinal _ energy .",
    "in such an experiment we have to be sure that the energy `` missed '' by the detectors was not carried away by undetected high rapidity sm particles .",
    "that is , to be sure that we observe ` quasielastic ' protons and not the decay products of some proton excitation ( and dissociation @xmath129 ) .",
    "the probability of diffractive proton dissociation is very large ( @xmath130 few mb ) in comparison with the expected ` invisible ' signal of the order of fb .",
    "we have considered the characteristics of the ` veto ' detectors ( like zdc and fsc / ada / adc ) that are required to suppress this background .",
    "we argue that the only chance is to work at a relatively low luminosities where the mean number of pile - up events is @xmath14 per bunch crossing .",
    "unfortunately , we have to conclude that for a completely invisible object , @xmath7 , it will be _ very _ challenging to search for it in the exclusive @xmath131 reaction .",
    "the present zdc , fsc , ada , adc detectors will not be able to sufficiently suppress the background .",
    "the situation appears to be better for the ` compressed mass ' bsm scenarios where , after the decay of the new heavy object into a completely invisible particle ( like the lsp in susy models ) plus some relatively low energy sm particles , these sm particles can be observed in the central detector .",
    "a good possibility is to observe in the central detector a pair of two different leptons ( say @xmath107 ) and nothing else .",
    "then the required background suppression looks manageable .",
