    "recent observations with high resolution have provided evidences for the existence of heavy elements in @xmath7 forest clouds at redshifts @xmath6 ( cowie et al . , 1995 , tytler et al . , 1995 ) .",
    "songaila and cowie ( 1996 ) claimed that more than @xmath10 of all @xmath9 absorbers with @xmath11 @xmath3 at @xmath1 are enriched .",
    "tytler et al . (",
    "1995 ) reported similar results : all @xmath7 systems with @xmath12 @xmath3 and 60% with @xmath11 @xmath3 .",
    "these values are expected to be lower limits , since the measurements of heavy elements are s / n limited , and all @xmath7 systems may contain heavy elements ( see also tytler 1988 ) . the abundance of metals , however , remains somewhat uncertain , especially because it depends on the value of the ionization parameter ( @xmath13 , the ratio of ionizing photon density to the particle density ) assumed .",
    "nevertheless , for a reasonable range of @xmath14 , the inferred metallicity is almost independent of the h  i column density , and is of order @xmath15 ( songaila & cowie 1996 ) .",
    "rauch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found from the comparison of the data with their numerical simulations that the metallicity has a mean @xmath16 solar and that there is a large scatter .",
    "songaila ( 1997 ) has recently reported a lower limit to the metallicity of order @xmath17 . for a low @xmath18 universe ( @xmath19 ) ,",
    "@xmath20 and a solar metallicity of @xmath21 , this implies a minimum metallicity of order @xmath22 solar .",
    "recent studies of metallicity and dust content in nearby galaxies have demonstrated that dust - to - gas ratio @xmath23 and metallicity @xmath24 correlate ( schmidt & boller , 1993 , lisenfeld & ferrara , 1997 ) .",
    "though the correlation is not always good , it definitely shows that the production of metals in galaxies is accompanied with dust formation .",
    "moreover , weak correlation between @xmath23 and @xmath25 in blue compact dwarf galaxies may indicate that galaxies during active phases of star formation eject dust along with metals in gaseous outflows ( lisenfeld & ferrara , 1997 ) .",
    "it is , therefore , reasonable to expect that if the igm and @xmath9 absorbers are enriched with metals , they are also contaminated with dust grains , produced inside the galaxies and transported into the igm along with metals .",
    "the presence of dust in the igm and its consequences was first discussed by rowan - robinson et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , who suggested that dust in the early universe at @xmath26 could lead to distortions of cmbr ( cosmic microwave background radiation ) ( see also vainer 1990 ; loeb & haiman 1997 ) .",
    "more recently , fall et al .",
    "( 1989 ) and pei et al .",
    "( 1991 ) have argued that the reddening of background quasars indicates directly that dust grains exist in damped @xmath7 systems .",
    "their dust - to - gas ratio ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath28 for different extinction curves assumed ( here @xmath29 , @xmath30 for the galaxy , fall & pei , 1989 ) .",
    "arguments based on the extinction of light by dust have led zou et al .",
    "( 1997 ) to similar estimates of @xmath23 in damped @xmath7 clouds toward the lensed quasar 0957 + 561 .",
    "they explain the difference in the continuum shape of the two spectra by differential reddening due to the presence of dust grains .",
    "recently , however , pettini et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have shown that the dust - to - metals ratio in damped @xmath7 systems is only @xmath31 of its value in local interstellar clouds ( thus , dust - to - gas ratio is @xmath32 ) .",
    "they infer this from the fact that cr and other refractory elements are depleted only by a factor of @xmath33 in 18 studied damped @xmath7 systems , much less than in the interstellar medium , and assuming that this depletion is due to freezing on dust grains .    in this paper",
    "we assume that dust particles are present not only in damped @xmath7 systems , but also in @xmath7 forest clouds , following the idea that dust is associated with metals .",
    "we concentrate here on detailed study of dust charging in the high redshift igm illuminated by the background uv and x - ray photons and heating due to injected supra - thermal photo - electrons  in several respects these processes differ from those in the local interstellar medium .",
    "we do not discuss here how metals and dust particles are supplied to the igm ; we refer the reader to the papers where the igm enrichment has been associated with population iii stars ( ciardi & ferrara , 1997 , gnedin & ostriker 1997 ) , early - forming very massive objects ( carr , bond & arnett 1984 ) , galactic winds from galaxies at high redshifts ( silk , wyse & shields 1987 ; miralda - escud & rees 1997 ; nath & trentham 1997 ) .",
    "the estimates show that an enriched igm with a metallicity of @xmath34 z@xmath35 at @xmath1 can be understood in terms of either population iii objects or galactic winds .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "2 we describe the basic processes and the equations , in  3 we describe the basic characteristics of charged high - redshift dust particles exposed to the background uv radiation , and photo - emitted electrons , and in  4 we present the results of the evolution of temperature in the igm with photo - induced dust heating as an important energy source .",
    "we then briefly discuss the implication of our results for @xmath9 absorbers . throughout the paper",
    "we use a hubble constant @xmath36 km s@xmath37 mpc@xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we first discuss the ambient photon background that is important for the process of charging of the dust at high redshift .",
    "the existence of a uv background radiation at high redshift has been inferred from proximity effect observations ( bajtlik et al .",
    "these observations show that the uv background radiation has an intensity at @xmath39 of @xmath40 , in the units of @xmath41 erg s@xmath37 @xmath3 sr@xmath37 hz@xmath37 ( @xmath42 ) ( bechtold 1994 ; cristiani et al . 1995 ; cooke et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "table 1 : models for the uv background radiation    0.2 in    [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     on the theoretical front , following the pioneering work of miralda - escud & ostriker ( 1990 ) , several authors have calculated the expected value of @xmath43 from the quasars , using existing quasar luminosity functions , and taking into account the absorption of photons by the intervening @xmath9 absorption systems ( e.g. , madau 1992 ; haardt and madau 1996 ) . this predicted intensity , however , falls short of the inferred intensity from the proximity effect ( cooke , espey and carswell 1996 ) .",
    "it has , therefore , been suggested that there are other sources of uv photons at high redshift , _",
    "e.g. _ young star forming galaxies , decaying neutrinos , or even a warm , collisionally ionized igm .",
    "the predicted _ spectrum _ of the uv background in these cases however is much different , and , therefore , observational constraints on the spectrum hold the clue to the origin of the high redshift uv background radiation .",
    "the observations of he  ii absorption at high redshift put constraints on the spectrum of the ionizing background ( jakobsen 1994 ; davidsen 1996 ) .",
    "meiksin & madau ( 1994 ) showed that the he  ii opacity observed by jakobsen ( 1994 ) softness ratio , @xmath44 at @xmath45 assuming a reasonable value of the opacity due to diffuse h  i ( see also , songaila , hu & cowie 1995 ) .",
    "for the davidsen ( 1996 ) observations , sethi and nath ( 1997 ) found that the allowed range of models is still large , after taking various uncertainties into account ( @xmath46 ) .",
    "there has been recent claims that the spectral index changes around @xmath1 ( songaila 1998 , reimers 1997 , hogan 1997 , savaglio 1997 ) , but we assume a constant spectral index for simplicity .",
    "we discuss the effect of such a change in the section  3.3 .    for our purpose here , we will use two models for the uv background radiation for our calculation , bearing in mind the above uncertainties .",
    "the first one ( referred to as qso ) represents the background radiation expected from only quasars , and the second one ( qso+yg ) , represents the radiation expected from quasars and young galaxies .",
    "the models are described in table 1 .",
    "the model qso is a broken power - law fit to the spectrum obtained by haardt and madau ( 1996 ) , for an intermediate redshift of @xmath47 .",
    "note that their calculation was actually for @xmath48 .",
    "the model qso+yg assumes the qso luminosity function of boyle ( 1991 ) , as in madau ( 1992 ) , and a population of young galaxies , which is used to make @xmath49 using the a3 model of absorption of giroux & shapiro ( 1996 ) ( again at @xmath47 ; see also sethi and nath 1997 ) .",
    "the values of the softness ratio @xmath50 for each model is given in table 1 .",
    "although the broken power laws are crude approximations to the actual spectrum , they suffice for our purpose of illustrating the effect of dust charging and heating at high redshift , in the light of the uncertainty in our knowledge of the uv background radiation .    beyond @xmath51",
    ", we use @xmath52 till @xmath53 kev for both models .",
    "this again mimics well the haardt & madau ( 1996 ) spectra for @xmath54 . for @xmath55 kev",
    ", we use the quasar x - ray spectral index of @xmath56 .",
    "zdziarski ( 1995 ) found a good fit to the data of seyferts with a spectral index of @xmath56 till @xmath57 kev .",
    "however , photons with energies much above @xmath58 kev do not contribute significantly in the charging and heating processes due to small absorption coefficients at these energies .",
    "the evolution of the background radiation in redshift also remains uncertain . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath59 remains a constant for @xmath60 , and @xmath61 for @xmath62 . this is a fit to the evolution of @xmath59 as calculated by madau ( 1992 ) for @xmath62 .",
    "also , we assume that the spectral shape remains a constant in time , although in reality the spectrum becomes softer at higher redshift due to increase in absorption ( miralda - escud & & ostriker 1990 ) .",
    "again , however , the uncertainties involved are large , and we assume a constant spectral shape for simplicity .      in this paper",
    "we follow draine ( 1978 ) and draine & salpeter ( 1979 , hereafter ds ) in describing the processes determining the grain charge .",
    "the equation governing the charge on a grain is written as follows    = 4a^2e_i j_i , where @xmath63 is the partial current due to particle of the @xmath64-th kind , and @xmath65 is the grain radius .",

    "we neglect the current from helium ions , since for the situations we are concerned with in this paper , the contribution from ions is in general small compared to electron and photoinduced currents .",

    "this restricts from above the charge of dust grains , the energy of photo - emitted electrons and thus the photoelectric heating . in our case , charging of dust grains and photoelectric heating are determined by photons with energy above lyman limit .",
    "bt stress that near threshold the photo - yield for graphite grains is usually overestimated . in our case , with photon energies and electric potentials much higher than in the ism , the contribution from the threshold region is small .      for silicate particles",

    "we note here that miralda - escud & rees ( 1994 ) also calculated the evolution of temperature in overdense regions of igm , which first collapse under gravity , during which the temperature rises to @xmath201 k due to adiabatic heating , and which then evolve with constant ( proper ) density , during which , due to high density and the consequent high recombination and line cooling rate , temperature falls down quickly to @xmath202 k.they , however , considered much higher densities ( @xmath203 @xmath116 ) than we use here ( @xmath204 @xmath116 ) ( at lower densities , the balance between the heating and cooling processes will be different , for example , adiabatic cooling will be more important ) .",
    "the evolution of temperature in an overdense region in the igm would depend on the initial temperature ( and epoch ) assumed .",
    "if the gas in the overdense region were initially compressed adiabatically , then the maximum temperature would be @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the density in the overdense region . for overdensities of order @xmath207 , that are considered to be typical values for @xmath9 absorbing systems ( see below ) , @xmath208 .",
    "the value of @xmath209 , however , depends on the thermal history of the igm ( miralda - escud & rees 1994 ) which remains uncertain .",
    "we , therefore , for the sake of illustrating the importance of dust heating , assume a few values of the initial temperatures of the overdense region @xmath210 which are of order @xmath211 k , and follow the thermal evolution in time .      in numerical calculations we used the heating rate due to photo - electric effect in dust grains as described above with grain size distribution @xmath212 with @xmath190 . for the relative fraction of graphites and silicates",
    ", we use the one given by pei ( 1992 ) for the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , which seems suitable for low metallicity objects at high redshift ( pei , fall & bechtold 1991 ) .",
    "we also show the thermal evolutions with only graphites and silicates involved .",
    "the case of only silicates correspond to the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) type dust grains ( pei 1992 ) . for other heating processes",
    "apart from dust heating , we use photoionization heating of a primordial gas , for both models of uv radiation .",
    "the heating due to photoionization of carbon atoms is smaller than this by a factor of @xmath213 ( @xmath214 ) for the qso+yg ( qso ) spectrum for a metallicity of @xmath215 . for cooling ,",
    "we use recombination cooling , cooling due to collisional ionization , line cooling ( in the presence of the uv radiation ) and bremsstrahlung for a primordial gas , as given in cen ( 1992 ) . cooling due to heavy elements at this metallicity and temperature",
    "is unimportant .",
    "inverse compton cooling at @xmath216 is not important and is neglected here ( the corresponding cooling time - scale is @xmath217 yr ; tegmark , silk & evrard ( 1993 ) ) .    in the model",
    "i , we assume that the overdense regions adiabatically expand keeping the overdensity a constant in time . in this case , therefore , we also include cooling due to adiabatic expansion . in the model",
    "ii , we consider regions with constant ( proper ) density , in which the gas is confined by gravity or shock ram pressure , or some other confinement mechanism .",
    "for model i , we use @xmath218 , for all redshifts , where @xmath206 is the density inside the cloud , @xmath219 is the critical density and @xmath220 is the global mean baryon density in the units of @xmath219 . for model",
    "ii , we use @xmath221 ( at @xmath222 ) for different values of the initial redshift @xmath223 .",
    "we use @xmath224 and initial temperature @xmath225 k. our choice of the parameters follow the result of cen & simcoe ( 1997 ) , that @xmath9 absorbers with @xmath226 @xmath3 had @xmath227 at @xmath6 for @xmath228 .",
    "the minimum width of @xmath9 lines at @xmath229 has been recently found to be @xmath230 km s@xmath37 ( kim 1997 ) . if the minimum width ( in the distribution of @xmath231 values ) is considered to be due to gas temperature ( see below for more discussion on this ) , this corresponds to a temperature of @xmath202 k and proves the presence of overdense regions with such temperatures at @xmath232 .",
    "here we consider the temperature evolution of such regions in time .    in reality",
    ", the gas in @xmath9 systems is expected to behave in a way which lies between our two models .",
    "numerical simulations show that the structures in the igm corresponding to @xmath9 forest absorption lines are sheet - like structures ( miralda - escud 1996 ) .",
    "the gas is confined in one dimension and flows along the sheet toward semi - spherical vortices . therefore , the density is expected to fall slower than @xmath233 .",
    "also , since these structures are transient , lasting about a hubble time , our calculations would be relevant only on time scales shorter than this .",
    "we show the evolution of the gas temperature in figure 8a and 8b for graphites and silicates .",
    "the dotted and solid lines refer to the cases without dust , and with dust with @xmath234 .",
    "the plots show the evolution for various initial temperatures , for the two models of background photons ( upper panels for qso and lower panels for qso+yg spectra ) .",
    "the case of silicates , of course , correspond to the grain mixture of the smc type ( pei 1992 ) . in figure 9",
    "we show the case of grain mixture of the lmc type ( pei 1992 ) for the qso spectrum for three values of initial temperatures and metallicities .",
    "it is seen that the dominant contribution to the heating comes from silicate grains for both type of spectra .",
    "this is due to the fact that for silicates , the absorption efficiency does not decrease with increasing photon energy as sharply as it does for graphites , and therefore , the high energy photons contribute substantially in this case . in case with hard background spectrum ( qso ) , the dust heating is more efficient for the same reasons due to contribution of high energy photons , and as a result of the high mean energy of photo - emitted electrons . in models",
    "i without dust heating adiabatic cooling decreases temperature sharply , so that at @xmath235 it is below 10@xmath236 k. dust heating is able to support temperature at the level @xmath237 down to @xmath238 . in models",
    "ii with dust heating temperature is factor of 1.52 higher than without dust heating . at @xmath239 both photoionization and photoelectric heating decrease due to decrease of the uv flux .",
    "since dust heating manifests itself better ( compared to other sources of heating ) at lower densities , it is conceivable that the diffuse , low density , ` intercloud ' component of the igm , if any , would have a much different thermal history with dust than with only photoionization heating .",
    "the density of such a component remains , however , uncertain .",
    "recent numerical studies show that most of the baryons in the igm are in the overdense regions , leaving about @xmath240 in the diffuse component ( zhang 1997 ) .",
    "their results show a fragmented igm at high redshift , and they claim that even the ` diffuse ' medium is also possibly fragmented into scales smaller than the resolution of the simulation . for @xmath224 and @xmath241 ,",
    "this corresponds to a density @xmath242 @xmath116 ( using @xmath243 of the baryons in the diffuse component ) .",
    "judging from the heating curves of fig .",
    "6 , such a component would be hotter than if only photoionization is used . however , the temperature would depend on the thermal history of the igm .      here",
    "we discuss briefly the effect of uncertainties in the parameters on our results . since the type of dust particles in @xmath9 systems is uncertain , we showed the temperature evolution for different types of dust ( graphite and silicate ) in figures 8a and 8b .",
    "it is seen that the effect on the temperature of the gas is by factors of order @xmath244 .",
    "we also show the effect of different metallicities on the temperature evolution in figure 9 , for @xmath245 .",
    "the difference in the temperature of the gas is again of order @xmath246 .",
    "since the actual temperature evolution of the gas would depend on the initial conditions , the readers are urged to use the heating rate shown in figure 6 , and scale it for the required metallicity for different cases ( the heating rate is proportional to the metallicity ) .    finally , the evolution of the uv background radiation is still uncertain .",
    "for example , it has been claimed that the spectrum changes at @xmath1 from soft at higher redshifts to a harder spectrum later ( songaila 1998 and the references therein ) .",
    "we have already shown the heating rates ( figure 6 ) and temperature evolution of the gas ( figures 8a and 8b ) for a hard ( qso ) and a soft ( qso+yg ) spectra , with the spectral index being constant in time .",
    "figures 8a and 8b show that the temperature of the gas at later redshifts ( @xmath247 ) differ by very small factors for different values of @xmath223 .",
    "since the heating rate for the soft spectrum case is very small compared to the hard spectrum case , a change in the spectrum at @xmath1 would essentially be equivalent to the case of @xmath248 , and as explained above , it would effect the temperature evolution at later redshifts only negligibly . for @xmath249 , the temperature would evolve much like the case of just photoionization between @xmath250 ( dotted lines in figures 8a and 8b ) .",
    "similarly , the possibility that the value of @xmath43 drops by a factor of @xmath251 from @xmath47 to @xmath252 ( williger 1994 , kim 1997 ) , would essentially mean a very small heating rate at @xmath5 , but as explained above , it would not effect the temperature evolution at later redshifts much .",
    "finally , we discuss various implications of our results on photoelectric heating due to dust in igm . to begin with ,",
    "we discuss the plausibility of having dust in the igm in the first place , , the survival of dust grains in igm .      before the discussion of the heating process due to dust ,",
    "let us first consider the question of the survival of dust grains in high - redshift lyman-@xmath0 clouds .",
    "as already mentioned , these clouds have typical densities @xmath253 at high redshift , metallicities @xmath254 , and they are exposed to background radiation @xmath255 erg @xmath3 s@xmath37 sr@xmath37 .",
    "it is not clear if these clouds were enriched by metals driven out of earlier generation dwarf galaxies with galactic winds or these metals come from _ in situ _ star formation ; though the small scatter in observed metallicities as @xmath256 changes by over four orders seems to favour the former explanation ( cowie & songaila 1998 ) .    in the model of enriching the igm by galactic winds at high redshifts ( silk , wyse & shields 1987 ; miralda - escud & rees 1997 ; nath & trentham 1997 ) , the enriched gas is swept along with the ambient igm by winds erupting out of dwarf galaxies due to the injection of energy by supernovae from an early bout of star formation .",
    "dust grains could form either the stars or in the shells of supernovae ( dwek 1998 ) .",
    "inside the parent galaxies , the processes of destruction of dust grains could be as efficient as in the galactic ism .",
    "the destruction of dust grains in our galaxy is still not well understood ( see mckee _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , and references therein ) .",
    "however , detailed modelling show that it is reasonable to assume that a fraction ( @xmath257 ) of refractory dust survives the destruction process in ism ( dwek 1998 ) .",
    "when the enriched material , presumably along with the dust grains , are ejected in the igm , the destruction processes become less important . for sputtering , for example ,",
    "the grain life time ( above the sputtering threshold ) is , @xmath258 here , @xmath259 is the number of heavy atoms in the grain , @xmath260 is the sputtering yield ( number of atoms ejected from the grain per impinging atom ) ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) , @xmath261 is the thermal speed of the ambient particles with density @xmath262 and temperature @xmath263 k , @xmath264 is the geometrical cross - section of the grains with radius @xmath65 and @xmath265 is a measure of the efficiency of collision .",
    "the numerical factor in the second expressions assumes @xmath266 and @xmath267 m. in this equation , @xmath262 is the density in the shell of the radiative shock ploughing through the igm .",
    "compare the above time - scale with the cooling time behind the shock ( shull & silk 1981 ) , @xmath268 where @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , dust can survive sputtering in the hot postshock region before it cools .",
    "the lyman-@xmath0 clouds are exposed to uv background radiation which can potentially destroy the dust particles from sublimation .",
    "however , the intensity of background radiation is several orders below the ambient radiation in local hii regions and it can be shown that the grain temperature is close to that of the microwave background radiation ( loeb & haiman 1997 ; ferrara _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) , which is too low for sublimation to be important .    if lyman-@xmath0 clouds are assumed to be star - forming regions then the uv flux inside these clouds can greatly exceed the background value ( for dust heating we do not consider this case ) . from deep , serendipitous searches for redshifted lyman-@xmath0 and @xmath269 emission lines , it is possible to put an upper limit on the ionizing intensity ( or equivalently on the average star - formation rate ) inside the clouds ( hogan & weymann 1987 ) .",
    "these searches give upper limits which suggest that the hydrogen - ionizing flux inside the clouds do not exceed the background value by more than a factor of 10 ( thomson and djorgovski 1995 , thomson _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . as the dust grain temperature , @xmath270",
    ", this additional uv flux does not appreciably enhance it .    in the local ism ,",
    "other destruction mechanisms are cosmic ray erosion and shattering from dust collisions .",
    "the properties of cosmic ray at high redshifts are largely unknown .",
    "however , even if we assume the cosmic ray density in the clouds to be comparable to local ism , the timescales of dust erosion are @xmath271 ( draine & salpeter 1979 ) .",
    "the timescale of dust - dust collision in shocks in local ism is @xmath272 ( jones _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ) . in lyman-@xmath0 clouds this time scale would be larger by a factor of the square of the ratio of ism to the cloud number density of grains . as",
    "this factor is @xmath273 , dust - dust collision can be neglected as an important destruction mechanism .",
    "also , since the magnetic field in the igm is thought be small ( @xmath274 g ; kronberg 1994 ) , other destruction processes like non - thermal sputtering from betatron acceleration also become unimportant .",
    "therefore , we assume the dust to gas ratio to be proportional to that in galactic ism with a factor @xmath275 .",
    "it is clear from the figures 5 , 6 and 7 that dust heating can play an important role in determining the physical state of the gas in @xmath9 absorbers , if they can be considered as overdense regions in the igm .",
    "as mentioned in  3 , the gas in @xmath9 absorbers are most likely to behave somewhere between the two extreme cases considered here , expand in two dimensions while being confined in one direction . in this case",
    "the gas would behave close to the evolution in model i , and dust can heat up the gas instead of letting it cool .",
    "the gas temperature in @xmath9 absorbers , however , is not directly observable .",
    "what is instead observed is the line width ( the @xmath231 value ) , and lines can be both thermally and velocity broadened .",
    "however , haehnelt , rauch & steinmetz ( 1996 ) have argued that the minimum value of @xmath231 in its distribution corresponds to the gas temperature , at least for lines with @xmath11 @xmath3 .",
    "numerical simulations seem to show that lines with lower column density are mostly velocity broadened ( miralda - escud & rees 1996 ) . in this context",
    ", it is interesting to note the recent observations of kim ( 1997 ) .",
    "they used keck spectra of 5 quasars at different redshifts and found that the minimum value of @xmath231 increased in time .",
    "we show the corresponding values of temperature in figure 7 as thick lines .",
    "although it is difficult to draw any firm conclusion , the evolution of temperature does suggest that dust heating can contribute towards raising the gas temperature in @xmath9 absorbers as required by these observations .",
    "note , that an alternative explanation for increase of the minimal doppler width with decreasing @xmath69 has been suggested recently by giallongo ( 1997 ) as a result of decrease of the softness parameter in framework of the photoionized heating model ( ferrara & giallongo , 1996 ) .",
    "a note on the uncertainties in our calculations due to our assumptions concerning the background radiation is in order here . unlike simple photoionization heating , heating due to dust grains is proportional to the intensity of the background radiation .",
    "this makes our calculations sensitive to the uncertainties in the background radiation , which include uncertainties in the qso luminosity function , the contribution from young galaxies and the opacity due to @xmath9 systems . as an example , using the la model of absorption from @xmath9 clouds of meiksin & madau ( 1993 ) ( see , sethi & nath 1997 ) , instead of model a3 of giroux & shapiro ( 1996 ) , would increase the background flux and the dust heating rate .",
    "since dust heating rate is proportional to the flux of photons , we would expect a rise in temperature in absorbing systems close to quasars .",
    "the uncertainties in various parameter , however , may make this prediction difficult to test .",
    "another prediction of our calculation is that , with a large scatter in the metallicity and also in the value of @xmath223 , there would be a scatter in the temperature and in the minimum width in the distribution of @xmath231 at a given redshift .",
    "as we have shown in  3 , if there is a low density ` intercloud ' part of the igm , then the thermal evolution of this component of igm would be much different with the inclusion of dust heating than if only photoionization heating were used .",
    "this heating would also depend on the metallicity , and the metallicity of the igm is not expected to be homogeneous .",
    "nath and trentham ( 1997 ) have estimated the probability distribution function of metallicity in the igm , in the case of igm enrichment from galactic winds , and found the standard deviation of the metallicity of order @xmath276 .",
    "rauch ( 1997 ) found from the comparison of data with their numerical simulation a scatter of an order of magnitude in the metallicity of @xmath9 absorbers .",
    "it , therefore , is reasonable to assume that there are regions in the igm with higher dust content than we have considered above , and so , hotter in general .",
    "( of course , the actual temperature would depend on the thermal history of the region . )    finally , we estimate the metallicity that is needed for dust heating to be more important than photoionization of a primordial gas . from fig .",
    "6 , we estimate this lower limit for the accepted qso type spectrum to be @xmath277 , when the grain mixture is dominated by silicates ( as in lmc or smc type of mixture ) .",
    "the feedback of the intergalactic medium on the process of galaxy formation is an interesting phenomenon and has been discussed in by several authors .",
    "the reionization and reheating of the intergalactic medium inhibit the formation of small galaxies by the suppression of cooling and because of the high temperature of the igm gas ( efstathiou 1992 , thoul & weinberg 1996 ) . here",
    "we briefly discuss the implications of dust photo - electric heating for such feedback mechanisms .",
    "first , unlike photoionization heating of a primordial gas , the dust photo - electric heating is proportional to the uv background radiation intensity .",
    "fluctuations in the intensity and spectrum of the background radiation would result in variation in the inhibiting efficiency .",
    "however , even for silicates and for qso type spectrum , the gas temperature is expected to change only by a factor @xmath246 , thereby increasing the jeans mass by a factor of @xmath8 .",
    "the dependence of the dust heating on the dust - to - gas ratio , however , has more interesting effects .",
    "when dust heating dominates in gravitationally confined ( i.e. with constant or growing density ) clouds , and the cooling is determined mainly by bremsstrahlung emission , @xmath278 , the gas temperature can be estimated from eq .",
    "[ eq : quahet ] as    @xmath279    where @xmath280 , is the dust - to - gas ratio .",
    "therefore , the enrichment of the gas ( higher @xmath280 ) results in the increase of gas temperature ( and jeans mass , @xmath281 ) , and thus suppresses subsequent formation of low mass galaxies .",
    "one can speculate from these simplified arguments that dust heating tends to suppress the progressive enrichment of the igm with heavy elements .",
    "however , if the metallicity of enriched igm gas exceeds a critical value @xmath282 , when radiative cooling from heavy elements dominates over bremsstrahlung cooling , metal - enriched regions cool efficiently and dust heating does not work anymore as a negative feedback . for cooling due to c  iv , which is the most dominant heavy element for cooling in these conditions",
    ", we estimate that @xmath283 , for @xmath49 , @xmath284 , and @xmath285 k. note also , that dust heating can work as a positive feedback ( stimulating formation of regions of low temperature due to thermal instability ) if hard spectrum ( @xmath286 ) and large ( @xmath287 m ) silicate grains dominate , though this case seems to be unrealistic .",
    "we summarise our findings :    \\(a ) it is reasonable to associate dust grains with the metallicity observed in high redshift @xmath9 absorbing systems , as the probability of the survival of dust grains during the process of spreading the metals and dust in the igm and in the @xmath9 systems is high .",
    "\\(b ) with the presence of the uv background radiation at high redshift , the dust particles in the igm acquire charges which are much larger than is typical in the ism , especially because of the low density of gas and high intensity of hard uv and x - ray photons .",
    "we illustrate this effect using two models of the uv background radiation , described in table 1 .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the dependences of the grain potential on gas density and grain size for graphites and silicates .",
    "silicates in general have larger charges , and harder spectra help to produce larger grain potentials .",
    "\\(c ) this results in a higher mean energy of the photo - ejected electrons , and therefore , yields an important source of heating of the igm gas .",
    "we show the volume heating rate as functions of the gas density , grain size distribution and grain type .",
    "silicates fare better as heating agents , and smaller grains dominates the heating rate in general .",
    "we estimate that dust heating would be important for our qso type spectra for a metallicity @xmath288 .",
    "\\(d ) using these heating rates , and grain mixtures of the lmc type , we compute the temperature evolution of the gas in overdense regions of the igm , with overdensity of @xmath200 , for various initial redshifts , initial temperatures and metallicities .",
    "we assume that the @xmath9 systems evolve in a passive manner , driven by the evolution of the background uv radiation and the boundary condition of the cloud expansion .",
    "we show the evolution for overdense regions which ( i ) adiabatically expand and keep the overdensity constant and ( ii ) which are confined either by shocks or gravity and keep the ( proper ) density constant .",
    "the difference in the temperatures in the cases when dust heating is included and when it is not , is of order of a factor of @xmath8 for our hard qso type spectra , for a metallicity of @xmath215 in a hubble time at @xmath6 for @xmath224 .",
    "\\(e ) we have speculated on the connection between the dust heating in such systems and the observed increase in the minimum width of @xmath9 absorption lines in time ( most probably indicative of increase in the gas temperature ) .",
    "we have also discussed the possible increase in the gas temperature of @xmath9 absorption systems near qsos due to increased uv flux , and the patchiness in the temperature of the igm due to ( i ) density inhomogeneity and the ( ii ) inhomogeneity in the metallicity .",
