    "the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , in which the spectrum of the minimal extension ( mssm ) is extended by one singlet superfield , was among the first supersymmetric ( susy ) models based on supergravity - induced susy - breaking terms .",
    "it has gained a renewed interest in the last decade , since it solves in a natural and elegant way the so - called @xmath3 problem  @xcite of the mssm : in the nmssm , this parameter is linked to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the singlet higgs field , and a value close to the susy - breaking scale is dynamically generated .",
    "in fact , the nmssm is the simplest supersymmetric generalization of the standard model ( sm ) in which the susy breaking scale is the _ only _ scale in the lagrangian , since it allows for a scale invariant superpotential .",
    "in contrast to the non or partially constrained versions of the nmssm that have been intensively studied in recent years  @xcite and which involve many free parameters , the constrained model ( cnmssm ) has soft susy - breaking parameters that are universal at a high scale such as the grand unification ( gut ) scale : common gaugino ( @xmath1 ) and scalar ( @xmath2 ) masses as well as trilinear couplings ( @xmath4 ) , as motivated by schemes for susy - breaking that are mediated by flavour blind gravitational interactions .",
    "if one assumes that the soft susy - breaking parameters involving the additional singlet sector are universal as well , the model has the same number of unknown parameters as the constrained mssm ( cmssm )  @xcite .",
    "general features of the constrained nmssm parameter space as well as aspects of its phenomenology have been discussed earlier in refs .",
    "these studies already revealed that the allowed range for the parameters @xmath5 and @xmath4 is different from that of the cmssm .",
    "small values for @xmath2 are disfavored in the cmssm , as they lead to charged sleptons that are lighter than the neutralino @xmath6 , the preferred lightest susy particle ( lsp ) . in the cnmssm , small @xmath2",
    "is needed to generate a non - vanishing vev of the singlet higgs field @xcite .",
    "the slepton lsp problem can be evaded owing to the presence of the additional singlino - like neutralino which , in large regions of the cnmssm parameter space , is the true lsp  @xcite .    since the early studies of the cnmssm , bounds on the higgs and susy particle spectrum from high - energy collider data and low - energy measurements have become more severe , and the dark matter relic density has been determined quite accurately  @xcite . in addition , tools for a more precise determination of the mass spectrum and couplings @xcite , and for the computation of the dark matter relic density @xcite ,",
    "have become available .",
    "in fact , the tools which allow to calculate the spectrum in the fully constrained nmssm have only been developed recently and a brief account of the resulting phenomenology has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we investigate in more detail the parameter space of the cnmssm in light of the recent constraints , using the updated tools .    a priori , it is not obvious if the latest constraints on the higgs sector from lep  @xcite and on the dark matter relic density  @xcite can be simultaneously satisfied in the fully constrained cnmssm with its additional cp - even and cp - odd higgs states and a singlino - like lsp . by scanning the cnmssm parameter space with with the program nmssmtools  @xcite , which calculates the higgs and susy particle spectra in the nmssm , we found regions where this is indeed possible  @xcite .",
    "these phenomenologically viable regions correspond to a regime of very small or vanishing universal scalar mass @xmath2 , and the requirement of a correct relic density determines the universal trilinear @xmath4 as a function of the universal gaugino mass @xmath1 .",
    "for low values of @xmath1 , for which @xmath4 is also quite small , the soft susy - breaking terms are necessarily close to their `` no - scale '' values , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "( @xmath8 , but nonvanishing values for @xmath1 and @xmath4 at a high scale , can also originate from a strongly interacting conformal hidden sector  @xcite ) . for small enough values of the yukawa coupling between the two doublet and the singlet higgs fields , @xmath9 , constraints from lep on the higgs sector as well as constraints from @xmath0-physics are also satisfied .",
    "notably , the model is very predictive in the sense that the complete sparticle spectrum depends essentially on just one parameter , which can be taken as @xmath1 .",
    "moreover , in these viable regions of the parameter space , the cnmssm can also explain the deviation of the observed anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath10 with respect to the sm expectation  @xcite _ as well as",
    "_ the @xmath11 and @xmath12 excesses of events observed at lep  @xcite corresponding to higgs masses around 115 gev and 98  gev , respectively .",
    "some of these results have already been published in ref .",
    "@xcite ; here we discuss in more detail the full allowed parameter space , the complete sparticle and higgs spectrum , as well as the phenomenological implications for future experiments , notably for the lhc .",
    "an unconventional but general property of the sparticle spectrum of the cnmssm is a singlino - like lsp with very small couplings to non - singlet particles , and a stau next - to - lsp ( nlsp ) with a mass close to that of the lsp .",
    "the stau will appear in practically all sparticle decay cascades .",
    "the small value of @xmath2 as compared to @xmath1 implies that all squarks are lighter than the gluino , a feature which will be relevant for sparticle searches at the lhc .",
    "the sm - like cp - even higgs boson has a mass in the 115120  gev range .    in some regions of the parameter space of the cnmssm , for instance for a very small yukawa coupling @xmath13",
    ", the stau lifetime can be very large , with visibly displaced vertices originating from its decay . for larger values of @xmath13 , the additional mostly singlet - like cp - even higgs",
    "boson can have sizable couplings to gauge bosons and a mass around 98  gev , which would in turn explain the @xmath12 excess of events observed at lep  @xcite ; the other @xmath14 excess of higgs - like events would be due to the nearly sm - like next - to - lightest cp - even higgs with a mass close to @xmath15 gev .",
    "hence , not only the sparticle spectrum of the cnmssm should already allow to discriminate it from the cmssm at the lhc , but additional unconventional phenomena such as displaced vertices or a more complicated higgs sector can also occur .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows : in section  2 we describe the model , its free parameters and discuss the phenomenologically viable cnmssm parameter space with the help of analytic approximations . in section  3",
    ", we present the results for the higgs and sparticle spectra . in section  4",
    "we discuss additional phenomenological aspects of the model that are relevant to the lhc : sparticle production cross sections and decay cascades , the possibility of displaced vertices from stau decays and features of the higgs sector .",
    "finally we comment on tests at @xmath16 colliders and the direct and indirect detection of dark matter , which can rule out the present model . a summary and concluding remarks are presented in section  5 .",
    "we consider the nmssm with a scale invariant superpotential given by @xmath17 where hatted letters denote superfields .",
    "@xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 represent the complex scalar higgs fields , with @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 their vacuum expectation values .",
    "tilded letters will denote the scalar components of quark and lepton superfields . for simplicity , only third generation (",
    "s)fermions have been included and @xmath24 stand for the @xmath25 and @xmath26 su(2 ) doublet superfields .",
    "the three first terms in eq .",
    "( [ supot ] ) are the usual generalization of the yukawa interactions , while the last two terms involving the singlet superfield @xmath27 substitute the @xmath28 term in the mssm superpotential : a non - vanishing value @xmath23 at the minimum of the higgs potential generates an effective @xmath3 term _ s .",
    "the singlet superfield @xmath27 contains a neutral cp - even and a neutral cp - odd scalar , as well as a neutralino .",
    "all these states mix with the corresponding components of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 superfields , increasing the rank of the cp - even , cp - odd and neutralino mass matrices by one as compared to the mssm .",
    "conventions for signs and mixing matrices are chosen as in the slha2  @xcite convention , and we take @xmath31 .    the soft susy ",

    "then , apart from gauge and quark / lepton yukawa couplings , the lagrangian of the cnmssm depends on the five input parameters [ pars ] m_1/2  ,  m_0  ,  a_0  ,  and   .",
    "requiring the correct value of @xmath33 reduces the dimension of the parameter space from five to four .    in principle",
    ", one could start with four independent parameters ( such as @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath13 and @xmath36 ) , and integrate the rg equations for all soft terms from @xmath32 down to the susy scale @xmath37 , defined by the order of magnitude of the soft susy - breaking terms .",
    "subsequently , one could minimize the effective potential with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and determine the overall scale of the soft terms in eq .",
    "( [ pars ] ) from the correct value of @xmath38 , as done in ref .",
    "however , since @xmath39 is then obtained as output ( while the top quark yukawa coupling @xmath40 would be an input ) , it becomes very difficult to obtain the correct value for the top quark mass @xmath41 or , given @xmath41 , @xmath40 can only be obtained once @xmath42 is known . since @xmath40 is very important for the radiative corrections and the rg evolution , it is much more convenient to allow for @xmath42 as an input parameter , which permits to determine @xmath40 at the weak scale from the beginning in terms of  @xmath43 .",
    "all in all , the following procedure is feasible in practice : apart from @xmath33 , the five parameters m_1/2  ,  m_0  ,  a_0  ,  and   are allowed as inputs . the parameters @xmath36 , the soft singlet mass @xmath44 as well as the vev @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) are determined at @xmath37 through the three minimization equations of the scalar potential with respect to @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "( with the convention @xmath47 , @xmath36 typically turns out to be positive as well , and of @xmath48 ; the sign of @xmath23 or @xmath49 can still be chosen at will . )",
    "this is the procedure employed by the routine nmspec within nmssmtools @xcite , which calculates the spectra of the higgs and susy particles in the nmssm in terms of the soft susy breaking terms at @xmath32 ( except for the parameter @xmath44 ) , @xmath42 at the weak scale ( defined by @xmath33 ) and @xmath13 at the susy scale @xmath37 .    clearly , the soft singlet mass squared @xmath44 at @xmath32 will not coincide with @xmath50 in general ( for a recent analysis allowing for a non - universal singlet mass term , see ref .",
    "however , one can confine oneself to regions in parameter space where the difference between @xmath44 and @xmath50 is negligibly small .",
    "this condition leaves us with an effective 4-dimensional parameter space , consistent with the considerations above . in practice",
    ", we determine @xmath42 by the requirement that @xmath44 at @xmath32 should be close to @xmath50 : we impose @xmath51 , which typically requires to tune the fourth decimal of @xmath42 .",
    "this should not be interpreted as a fine - tuning , since @xmath44 should be considered as an input parameter , whereas @xmath42 is determined by the minimization of the effective potential .    for the most relevant sm parameters , the strong coupling and the bottom / top quark masses , we chose @xmath52 , @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 gev @xcite .",
    "let us begin by recalling some conditions on the parameters @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath4 of the , which follow from a phenomenologically acceptable minimum of the higgs potential  @xcite .",
    "first , the vev @xmath23 of the singlet has to be non - vanishing .",

    "s^3 + m_s^2 s^2 +  , and one easily finds that the condition for a non - vanishing value for @xmath23 at the absolute minimum is equivalent to the inequality @xmath55    for small @xmath13 and @xmath36 ( as will be the case below )",
    ", the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 are hardly renormalized between the gut and the electroweak scales , and the above condition translates into the first constraint on the parameter space ( assuming @xmath58 ) @xmath59    next , we consider the cp - odd higgs boson mass matrix .",
    "the dominant term in its singlet - like diagonal element is given by @xcite @xmath60 and must be positive . for positive @xmath23 and @xmath36",
    "this implies negative trilinear couplings @xmath61    we must also consider the constraints on the parameter space arising from vacuum stability .",
    "dangerous instabilities of the scalar potential along charge and colour breaking ( ccb ) directions in field space can occur  @xcite , notably for large values of @xmath62 .",
    "the most dangerous ccb direction is along the d - flat direction @xmath63 in field space , where @xmath64 and @xmath65 are the right- and left - handed selectron fields , and where the term @xmath66 in the scalar potential can give a large negative contribution .",
    "once @xmath67 and the corresponding soft masses at the appropriate scale ( using the corresponding rg equations ) are expressed in terms of @xmath4 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the condition for the absence of such a charge and colour breaking minimum becomes  @xcite [ ccb ] ( a_0 - 0.5 m_1/2)^2 9 m_0 ^ 2 + 2.67 m_1/2 ^ 2 . in our analysis",
    "we will obtain relatively small values for @xmath4 ( @xmath68 , cf .",

    "@xcite , it has been clarified that such dangerous directions in the field space of the mssm are still present in the nmssm , although the singlet vev @xmath23 gives an additional positive contribution to the potential .",

    "let us comment on the prospects for detecting the singlino - like lsp @xmath157 ( with non - singlet components of @xmath158 ) ) in astroparticle experiments .",
    "for the direct lsp detection via @xmath157-nuclei interactions , the prospects are quite dim : due to the very small values of @xmath13 that are required from compatibility of the higgs sector with lep bounds , one finds extremely small wimp - nucleon cross sections and larger values of @xmath13 , which are not possible in the present case . ] .",
    "we computed these cross sections using the recent version of the dark matter code micromegas  @xcite , adapted to the nmssm .",
    "the result is that the relevant values for the spin - independent and spin - dependent proton and neutron interaction cross - sections are always below @xmath159  pb , implying an expected number of events smaller than @xmath160/day / kg for both @xmath161ge and @xmath162xe nuclei , and less than @xmath163/day / kg for @xmath164he .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath6 has extremely small couplings to sm fermions and gauge bosons , the annihilation cross sections of @xmath6 into sm particles are always extremely small .",
    "the only significant channel could be the annihilation process @xmath165 with the cp - odd singlet - like @xmath155 state being sufficiently light to be produced on  shell .",
    "however , the @xmath166 coupling is proportional to @xmath36 which is tiny in our case , @xmath167 .",
    "thus all cross sections involving the singlino lsp are extremely small ; in other words , the fully constrained cnmssm can be excluded by the direct or indirect detection of a wimp - like dark matter candidate .",
    "due to its simplicity , namely a scale invariant superpotential and universal susy - breaking terms at the gut scale , the cnmssm is a very attractive supersymmetric extension of the standard model .",
    "we have found that for small values of the nmssm specific yukawa coupling , @xmath88 , the cnmssm can satisfy all present phenomenological constraints including lep constraints on the higgs sector .",
    "the correct dark matter relic density is obtained for small @xmath2 and @xmath4 as compared to @xmath1 . moreover , in the region @xmath168  gev , the deviation of @xmath10 from its sm model value and the two excesses of higgs - like events observed at lep can be simultaneously explained .",
    "the cnmssm sparticle spectrum allows to discriminate it from most versions of the mssm : all squarks are lighter than the gluino , and due to the weakly coupled singlino - like lsp and the stau nlsp , the latter will show up in practically all sparticle decay cascades . in some regions of the parameter space ,",
    "the stau lifetime can be sufficiently large , possibly leading to visibly displaced vertices .    the mass of the sm - like cp - even higgs boson is constrained to lie in the 115  120  gev range , and for certain regions in parameter space it could strongly mix with the singlet - like higgs state . in a small  different  region of the parameter space , decays of the sm - like cp - even higgs boson into two singlet - like higgs states are possibly detectable at an ilc .",
    "note that the model is very predictive : as it becomes clear from figs .",
    "[ fig : m12:phenox0st ] and [ fig : m12:phenogql ] , the measurement of one sparticle mass ( or mass difference ) would allow to predict quite accurately the complete remaining sparticle spectrum . on the other hand , due to the singlino - like lsp together with small @xmath13 , dark matter detection signals can rule out the present model .    hopefully , the cnmssm can be tested in the near future at the lhc . to this end",
    "the sensitivities of the atlas and cms detectors to sparticle decay cascades involving the stau nlsp should be thoroughly studied .",
