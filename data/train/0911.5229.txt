    "the bright nova v1280 sco ( nova sco 2007 @xmath31 , , , equinox 2000.0 ) was discovered on 2007 february 4 by two japanese observers ( y. sakurai and y. nakamura ) independently , as communicated by @xcite .",
    "@xcite obtained a low dispersion spectrum of the object on feb .",
    "5.87 and found that it had a smooth continuum together with the balmer and fe  ii lines showing p cygni profiles .",
    "the nova had brightened greatly during the first 10 days and reached the maximum brightness @xmath2 = 3.8 on feb .",
    "16 @xcite .",
    "the outburst amplitude ( @xmath4 ) is 15 mag or larger because @xcite noted that no star was visible down to @xmath5 and @xmath6 magnitudes of 20.3 and 19.3 , respectively , on pre - discovery plates .",
    "@xcite reported their photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the nova and noted that on feb .",
    "20.24 the nova showed a typical classical nova spectrum of the fe  ii type characterized by a rich forest of strong permitted emission lines of fe  ii displaying deep p cyg profiles .",
    "@xcite observed the nova in the near ir region on 2007 march 4.95 and found that the continuum in the 1.08 - 2.35 @xmath7 region had risen sharply indicating the dust formation in the nova ejecta .",
    "@xcite reported spectroscopic observations in the visual - near ir regions carried out in 2007 may and found that the nova was in a very low excitation state showing strong c  i lines and no discernible he  i emission .",
    "they estimated the reddening , which is in part due to the dust shell , from the o  i lines and derived e(@xmath8 ) = 1.7 mag .",
    "photometric behaviors of the nova in the optical region until 2007 october 9 are summarized by @xcite .",
    "they pointed out a re - brightening in 2007 may and noticed an unexpected large re - brightening in 2007 september .",
    "high spatial resolution interferometric observations in the near and mid ir regions were carried out using the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti ) .",
    "@xcite observed spectra and visibilities of the nova from 2007 february 28 to june 30 and determined an apparent linear expansion rate for the dust shell .",
    "they pointed out that the approximate time of the mass ejection during which the dust shell had formed was close to the date of the maximum brightness .",
    "they used the observed expansion velocity and the linear expansion rate to derive an upper limit of the distance to be @xmath1 1.9 kpc .",
    "we have continued photometric observations in @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands at osaka kyoiku university and in @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands at higashi hiroshima observatoty until 2009 september .",
    "low resolution spectroscopic observations were conducted at nish - harima astronomical observatory .",
    "part of our photometric and spectroscopic observations has been reported in @xcite .",
    "a long - term ( spanning three years ) light curve of v1280 sco reveals unique features among classical novae .",
    "figure 1 shows long - term light curves in the @xmath2 and the @xmath10 bands including the latest observations obtained in the summer of 2009 .",
    "after the initial rapid decline in the @xmath2 band , the nova showed a temporary re - brightening in 2007 may .",
    "then it declined and reached a minimum ( @xmath1 16 mag in the @xmath2 band ) in 2007 august .",
    "after 2007 september , the nova recovered its brightness in all bands and a bright plateau ( @xmath1 10 mag in the @xmath2 band ) had continued throughout 2008 .",
    "although the nova showed a slight decline starting from 2009 may , it was still brighter than 11 mag in the @xmath2 band in 2009 august , more than 900 d after the @xmath2 band maximum .",
    "one of the notable feature of the optical light curve is a close resemblance between the @xmath10 , which is free from emission lines , and the @xmath2 magnitudes . even in the summer of 2009",
    ", its @xmath10 magnitude is only slightly fainter than the @xmath2 magnitude .",
    "this implies that the optical region spectrum is dominated by the continuum radiation even 900 d after the @xmath2 band maximum .",
    "a detailed discussion of the light and color curves will be presented in a separate paper .",
    "a low resolution optical spectrum of v1280 sco obtained at higashi hiroshima observatoty on 2009 february shows no hint of the [ o  iii ] forbidden lines .",
    "thus , the nova has not entered the nebular phase yet .",
    "( 75mm,70mm)fig1.eps    we have carried out high resolution optical region spectroscopic observations of the nova in 2009 in order to clarify the physical conditions in the continuum radiating source .",
    "here we focus on a remarkable finding concerning the highly blue - shifted narrow absorption components associated with the na  i yellow doublet lines .",
    "spectroscopic observations of v1280 sco were carried out at three epochs with the subaru telescope using the high dispersion spectrograph ( hds ) on 2009 may 9 , june 15 and 16 and july 4 and 6 ( ut ) , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "our first observation was made 814 d after the optical maximum . on may 9",
    ", we obtained a sky observation using the same instrumental setup because the sky was hazy and the object was located close to the bright moon .",
    "the sky condition on the subsequent nights in june and july was fairly clear and no sky subtraction had been applied for data obtained in june and july .",
    "technical details and the performance of the spectrograph are described in @xcite .",
    "we used a slit width of ( 0.3 mm ) and a 2x1 binning mode , which enabled us to achieve a nominal spectral resolving power of about @xmath13 with a 3.5 pixel sampling .",
    "our observations covered the wavelength region from 4050    to 6760  . for flat - fielding of the ccd data",
    ", we obtained halogen lamp exposures ( flat images ) with the same setup as that for the object frames .",
    ".log of spectroscopic observations . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     it is interesting to examine whether the highly blue - shifted absorptions can be seen associated with other metal lines or the balmer emission lines .",
    "a region near the strong fe  ii line 5018.440    is displayed in figure 7 and the profile of h@xmath14 is shown in figure 8 .",
    "expected positions for the two strong absorption features ( e and g ) are indicated by arrows .",
    "we can confirm no absorption feature in these lines and thus conclude that the highly blue - shifted absorptions are only associated with the resonant transitions of na  i. a relatively broad ( hwhm @xmath1 60 km s@xmath0 ) absorption feature is seen in figures 7 and 8 , which is blue - shifted by @xmath1 -255 km s@xmath0 relative to the emission peak .",
    "we interpret this absorption originates in the expanding wind of the photosphere .",
    "( 70mm,70mm)fig7.eps    ( 70mm,70mm)fig8.eps",
    "we have discovered multiple high - velocity absorption components corresponding to both the d2 and the d1 lines of na  i on high resolution spectra of v1280 sco observed three years after the explosion .",
    "there are at least 11 sharp ( fwhm @xmath1 15 km@xmath0 ) components and they are highly blue - shifted , ranging from -900 to -650 km s@xmath0 , on the helio - centric velocity scale . these absorptions are not associated with fe  ii or the balmer emission lines .",
    "this implies that the high - velocity absorptions are produced in a cool environment where iron atoms are in neutral state and most hydrogen atoms stay in the ground state .",
    "this must be a very rare finding because we know no previous similar observation in the literature .",
    "@xcite reported observations of short - lived blue - shifted metallic absorption systems , including the na  i d lines , near the maximum light of various novae .",
    "these absorption lines have expansion velocities from 400 to 1000 km s@xmath0 and velocity dispersions between 35 and 350 km s@xmath0 .",
    "they are usually accelerated outward and progressively weaken and disappear over timescales of weeks ( within 100 d ) .",
    "they proposed a spiral ring model to interpret their observations .",
    "they suggest that some material ejected by the secondary star before the nova outburst is spiraling around the binary system . after the nova outburst",
    ", a rapidly expanding luminous photosphere is produced and it collides with the pre - existing gas stream .",
    "our observations of narrow and high - velocity absorption components associated with the na  i d lines appear hard to be interpreted in this scheme .",
    "our data were obtained more than 800 d after the explosion , while the transient absorptions reported in @xcite usually disappear over timescales of weeks .",
    "their analysis of absorption line systems observed in lmc 2005 shows the excitation temperature to be around 10@xmath15 k , which is too high to explain the absence of high - velocity absorption components associated with fe  ii lines .",
    "furthermore , the observed line widths of the high - velocity absorption components in v1280 sco are narrower than the widths noted in @xcite .",
    "finally , the large number ( at least 11 ) of the absorption components looks difficult to be interpreted in this scenario .",
    "we propose that the observed high velocity absorption components originate in many cool clumpy gas clouds moving toward the observer on the line of sight .",
    "these gas clouds are produced after the nova explosion in interactions between the pre - existing cool circumstellar gas and the high velocity gas ( @xmath1 2000 km s@xmath0 , naito et al .",
    "2009 ) ejected in the nova explosion .",
    "@xcite suggested that the 2000 km s@xmath0 gas might be associated with the second mass ejection episode corresponding to the temporal re - brightening observed in 2009 may . in the case of v1280 sco ,",
    "the binary system had been embedded in a relatively dense circumstellar cloud , and the pre - existing circumstellar gas had not necessarily been supplied from the secondary star as suggested in @xcite . the prompt formation of dust in this nova @xcite is likely to be triggered by the interaction between the surrounding clouds and the expanding ejecta .",
    "many small gas clouds might have been produced during the turbulent interaction in the shock and expelled outward with velocities ranging from -1000 to -500 km s@xmath0 .",
    "we suppose that some of the clouds are moving toward us on the line - of - sight and produce multiple absorption lines .",
    "the observed increase in line depths for several components may be the result of rapid cooling of these clouds , increasing the number density of neutral na capable of absorbing the d line photons .",
    "this picture is hinted by a direct image of the old nova gk per observed with the wiyn 3.5 m telescope @xcite .",
    "confirmation of this scenario could come from future high spatial resolution imaging observations .",
