    "kinetic theory is an important part of general statistical physics related to phenomena which can not be understood on the thermodynamic or fluid models level [ 1 ] . in these two papers",
    "we consider the applications of a new numerical / analytical technique based on wavelet analysis approach for calculations related to the description of complex ( non - equilibrium ) behaviour of the corresponding classical and quantum ensembles .",
    "the classical ensembles in this part are considered in the framework of the general bbgky hierarchy and the quantum ones in part 2 in the wigner - weyl approach [ 1 ] .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the rational / polynomial type of nonlinearities ( with respect to the set of all dynamical variables ) that allows to use our results from [ 2 ] , which are based on the so called multiresolution framework [ 3 ] and the variational formulation of initial nonlinear ( pseudodifferential ) problems .",
    "wavelet analysis is a set of mathematical methods which give a possibility to work with well - localized bases in functional spaces and provide the maximum sparse forms for the general type of operators ( differential , integral , pseudodifferential ) in such bases .",
    "it provides the best possible rates of convergence and minimal complexity of algorithms inside and , as a result , saves cpu time and hdd space [ 3 ] .",
    "our main goals are an attempt of classification and construction of a possible zoo of nontrivial ( meta ) stable states : ( a ) high - localized ( nonlinear ) eigenmodes , ( b ) complex ( chaotic - like or entangled ) patterns , ( c ) localized ( stable ) patterns ( waveletons ) . in case ( c ) an energy is distributed during some time ( sufficiently large ) between only a few localized modes ( from point ( a ) ) .",
    "we believe , it is a good image for plasma in a fusion state ( energy confinement ) . our construction of cut - off of the infinite system of equations is based on some criterion of convergence of the full solution . this criterion is based on a natural norm in the proper functional space , which takes into account ( non - perturbatively ) the underlying multiscale structure of complex statistical dynamics . in sec .",
    "2 the kinetic bbgky hierarchy is formulated . in sec .",
    "3 we present the explicit analytical construction of solutions of the hierarchy , which is based on tensor algebra extensions of bases generated by the hidden multiresolution structure and proper variational formulation leading to an algebraic parametrization of the solutions .",
    "so , our approach resembles bogolyubov s and related approaches but we do nt use any perturbation technique ( like virial expansion ) or linearization procedures",
    ". numerical modeling as in general case as in particular cases of the vlasov - like equations shows the creation of various internal structures from localized bases modes , which demonstrate the possiblity of existence of ( metastable ) pattern formation .",
    "let @xmath0 be the phase space of an ensemble of @xmath1 particles ( @xmath2 ) with coordinates @xmath3 .",
    "individual and collective measures are : @xmath4 . our constructions can be applied to the following general hamiltonians : @xmath5 where the potentials @xmath6 and @xmath7 are restricted to rational functions of the coordinates .",
    "let @xmath8 and @xmath9 be the liouvillean operators ( vector fields ) @xmath10 @xmath11 and @xmath12 be the hierarchy of @xmath1-particle distribution function . satisfying the standard bbgky ",
    "hierarchy ( @xmath13 is the volume ) [ 1 ] : @xmath14 in most cases , one is interested in a representation of the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 are correlators .",
    "additional reductions often lead to simplifications , the simplest one , @xmath17 , corresponding to the vlasov approximation .",
    "such physically motivated ansatzes for @xmath18 formally replace the linear ( in @xmath18 ) and pseudodifferential ( in general case ) infinite system ( 2 ) by a finite - dimensional but nonlinear system with polynomial nonlinearities ( more exactly , multilinearities [ 3 ] ) .",
    "our key point in the following consideration is the proper nonperturbative generalization of the perturbative multiscale approach of bogolyubov .",
    "the infinite hierarchy of distribution functions satisfying system ( 2 ) in the thermodynamical limit is : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 ( or any different proper functional space ) , @xmath22 @xmath23 with the natural fock space like norm ( guaranteeing the positivity of the full measure ) : @xmath24 first of all we consider @xmath25 as a function of time only , @xmath26 , via multiresolution decomposition which naturally and efficiently introduces the infinite sequence of the underlying hidden scales [ 3 ] . because the affine group of translations and dilations generates multiresolution approach , this method resembles the action of a microscope .",
    "we have the contribution to the final result from each scale of resolution from the whole infinite scale of spaces .",
    "we consider a multiresolution decomposition of @xmath27 [ 3 ] ( of course , we may consider any different and proper for some particular case functional space ) which is a sequence of increasing closed subspaces @xmath28 ( subspaces for modes with fixed dilation value ) : @xmath29 the closed subspace @xmath30 corresponds to the level @xmath31 of resolution , or to the scale j and satisfies the following properties : let @xmath32 be the orthonormal complement of @xmath33 with respect to @xmath34 : @xmath35 then we have the following decomposition : @xmath36 in case when @xmath37 is the coarsest scale of resolution .",
    "the subgroup of translations generates a basis for the fixed scale number : @xmath38 the whole basis is generated by action of the full affine group : @xmath39 let the sequence @xmath40 correspond to multiresolution analysis on the time axis , @xmath41 correspond to multiresolution analysis for coordinate @xmath42 , then @xmath43 corresponds to the multiresolution analysis for the @xmath44-particle distribution function @xmath45 .",
    "e.g. , for @xmath46 : @xmath47 @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 form a multiresolution basis corresponding to @xmath41 .",
    "if @xmath51 form an orthonormal set , then @xmath52 form an orthonormal basis for @xmath53 .",
    "so , the action of the affine group generates multiresolution representation of @xmath54 . after introducing the detail spaces @xmath55 , we have , e.g. @xmath56 then the 3-component basis for @xmath57 is generated by the translations of three functions : @xmath58 also , we may use the rectangle lattice of scales and one - dimensional wavelet decomposition : @xmath59 where the basis functions @xmath60 depend on two scales @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "we obtain our multiscale / multiresolution representations ( formulae ( 11 ) below ) via the variational wavelet approach for the following formal representation of the bbgky system ( 9 ) ( or its finite - dimensional nonlinear approximation for the @xmath44-particle distribution functions ) with the corresponding obvious constraints on the distribution functions .",
    "let @xmath63 be an arbitrary ( non)linear differential / integral operator with matrix dimension @xmath64 ( finite or infinite ) , which acts on some set of functions from @xmath65 : @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath44 is the number of particles : @xmath69 let us consider now the @xmath1 mode approximation for the solution as the following ansatz : @xmath70 we shall determine the expansion coefficients from the following conditions ( different related variational approaches are considered in [ 2 ] ) : @xmath71 @xmath72 thus , we have exactly @xmath73 algebraical equations for @xmath73 unknowns @xmath74 .",
    "so , the solution is parametrized by the solutions of two sets of reduced algebraical problems , one is linear or nonlinear ( depending on the structure of the operator @xmath63 ) and the rest are linear problems related to the computation of the coefficients of the algebraic equations ( 10 ) . which can be found by using the compactly supported wavelet basis functions for the expansions ( 9 ) . as a result",
    "the solution of the equations ( 2 ) has the following multiscale decomposition via nonlinear high - localized eigenmodes @xmath75 @xmath76 @xmath77 which corresponds to the full multiresolution expansion in all underlying time / space scales .",
    "the formulae ( 11 ) give the expansion into a slow and fast oscillating parts .",
    "so , we may move from the coarse scales of resolution to the finest ones for obtaining more detailed information about the dynamical process . in this way one obtains contributions to the full solution from each scale of resolution or each time / space scale or from each nonlinear eigenmode .",
    "it should be noted that such representations give the best possible localization properties in the corresponding ( phase)space / time coordinates . formulae ( 11 ) do not use perturbation techniques or linearization procedures .                numerical calculations are based on compactly supported wavelets and related wavelet families [ 3 ] and on evaluation of the accuracy on the level @xmath1 of the corresponding cut - off of the full system ( 2 ) regarding norm ( 4 ) : @xmath78 we believe that the appearance of nontrivial localized patterns ( a)-(c ) demonstrated on fig.1fig.3 constructed by these methods is a general effect which is also present in the full bbgky hierarchy , due to its complicated intrinsic multiscale dynamics and it depends on neither the cut - off level nor the phenomenological - like hypothesis on correlators .",
    "so , representations like ( 11 ) and the prediction of the existence of the ( asymptotically ) stable localized patterns / states ( energy confinement states ) in bbgky - like systems are the main results of this paper ."
