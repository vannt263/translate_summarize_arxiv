    "entanglement plays an important role in quantum information processing @xcite .",
    "it has many practical applications , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum cryptograph @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , quantum secure direct communication @xcite and other quantum information protocols @xcite . in order to achieve such tasks ,",
    "the legitimate uses , say the sender alice and the receiver bob should first share the entanglement in distant locations . in a long - distance quantum communication ,",
    "quantum repeaters are unusually used to sent the quantum signals over an optical fiber or a free space @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in a practical transmission , the entangled quantum system can not avoid the channel noise from the environment .",
    "it will make the quantum system decoherence .",
    "that is , a maximally entangled state will become a less - entangled state or a mixed entangled state .",
    "quantum concentration is to distill some maximally entangled state from an ensemble in a pure less - entangled state @xcite . in 1996 , bennett _ et al .",
    "_ proposed an entanglement concentration protocol ( ecp ) , which is called schmidit projection method @xcite .",
    "_ proposed an ecp based on the swapping @xcite .",
    "ecps based on linear optical elements were proposed by yamamoto _",
    "_ and zhao _ et al .",
    "_ , respectively @xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "an ecp based on cross - kerr nonlinearity was proposed @xcite . in 2011",
    ", an ecp based on the quantum - dot in an optical cavity was proposed .",
    "this kind of ecps are all used to concentrate a less - entangled state @xmath0 to a maximally entangled state @xmath1 .",
    "unusually , in each concentration step , they choose two similar copies of less - entangled states and after performing the ecp , at least one pair of maximally entangled state can be obtained with certain probability .",
    "the most advantage of this ecp is that they do not need to know the exact coefficients @xmath2 and @xmath3 . on the other hand",
    ", there is another kind of ecp which can be used to concentration a less - entangled w state into a maximally entangled w state .",
    "for example , in 2003 , cao and yang proposed an ecp for w - class state using joint unitary transformation@xcite .",
    "et al . _ proposed an ecp with the help of collective bell - state measurement @xcite .",
    "the ecps for a special less - entangled w state were proposed in both linear optical system and cavity qed system @xcite . in 2011 , yildiz proposed an optimal ecp for asymmetric w states of the form @xcite @xmath4    on the other hand , the ecps described above are unusually based on the universal qubit say @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite or the optical system , which @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 represent the horizontal and vertical polarization of the photon , respectively .",
    "recently , there is a novel candidate for qubit which is a single spin coupled to an optical microcavity based on a charged qantum - dot @xcite . for example , hu _ et al .",
    "_ proposed an deterministic photon entangler using a charged quantum dot inside a microcavity@xcite .",
    "they also proposed an entanglement beam splitter and discussed the loss - resistant state teleportation and entanglement swapping using a quantum dot spin in an optical microcavity @xcite .",
    "_ discussed the cnot gate and bell - state analysis in the weak - coupling cavity qed regime @xcite .",
    "proposed two entanglement purification protocols based on the hybrid entangled state using quantum - dot and microcavity coupled system @xcite .",
    "recently , a efficient quantum repeater protocol was proposed @xcite . inspired by the novel works of hu and wang , we propose an ecp for the less - entangled w state exploiting the quantum - dot and microcavity coupled system . in this protocol",
    ", the less - entangled w state of the spin in the cavity qed system can be concentrated into a maximally entangled w state with some ancillary single photons .",
    "this protocol is quite different from the others .",
    "first , we can concentrate the arbitrary less - entangled w state .",
    "second , we do not need two copies of less - entangled pairs .",
    "third , the ecp can be performed between different degrees of freedoms , that is we use the single photons to concentrate the less - entangled state in spin .",
    "fourth , by repeating this ecp , it can reach a higher success probability .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we describe the theoretical model for our ecp .",
    "we call it a hybrid parity check gate based on photon and electron coupled systems . in sec .",
    "iii , we explain our ecp based on the parity check gate . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the efficiency and errors on a practical implementation . in sec .",
    "v , we present a discussion and summary .",
    "before we start to explain this ecp . we first describe the basic element for this protocol .",
    "it is also shown in refs .",
    "@xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , the system is composed of a single charged quantum - dot in micropillar microcavites .",
    "the charge exciton consists of two electrons bound in one hole and the excitation with negative charges can created by the optical excitation of the system .",
    "therefore , if we consider a photon entrances into the cavity from the input mode and it will interact with the electron in the coupling cavity .",
    "interestingly , the left circularly polarized photon @xmath11 only couples with the electron in the spin up state @xmath12 to the exciton @xmath13 in the state @xmath14 because of the pauli s exclusion principle for two electrons . on the other hand , the right circularly polarized photon @xmath15 only couples with the electron of the spin down @xmath16 in the state @xmath17 . here",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the spin direction of the heavy hole spin state . in ref .",
    "@xcite , hu _ et al .",
    "_ discussed that such system essentially is an entanglement beam splitter which directly splits an initial hybrid product state of photon and spin into two entangled states via transmission and refection in a deterministic way .",
    "they denoted the transmission and reflection operators as    @xmath20 with @xmath21 and the electron spin is @xmath12 . here",
    "the superscript @xmath12 means the photon s propagation direction is along the z axis .",
    "both the polarization of the photon and propagation direction are flipped into @xmath22 . in the same way",
    ", the photon and electron interaction in quantum dot and microcavity coupled systems can be fully described as @xmath23        so if the initial input state is the photon - spin product state @xmath24 , it will be converted into the two constituent hybrid entangled state @xmath25 in the transmission port , say output2 mode and @xmath26 in the reflection port , say output1 mode respectively , with the success probability of 100% , in principle . in the following ,",
    "we denote the transmission port as output2 mode and the reflection port as output1 for simple , shown in fig .",
    "a parity check gate has been widely in current quantum processing .",
    "entanglement purification and concentration all need such elements .",
    "an optical parity check gate , such as polarization beam splitter , can convert the product state @xmath27 into two constituent entangled state @xmath28 and @xmath29 . compared with the polarization beam splitter in optical system , it essentially acts the same role of the parity check gate , but with different degrees of freedom .",
    "so we call it a hybrid parity check gate .",
    "now we start to explain our protocol . from fig .",
    "2 , the less - entangled w state are shared by alice , bob and charlie .",
    "it can be written as : @xmath30    here @xmath31 and subscripts 1 , 2 and 3 mean spin 1 , spin 2 and spin 3 respectively .",
    "suppose that the three parties know the initial coefficients @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 .",
    "alice first prepare a single photon of the form @xmath35 means the photon coupled with the spin 1 .",
    "she sends the state @xmath36 to the cavity from the input mode .",
    "the initial less - entangled w state combined with the single photon evolve as @xmath37 interestingly , from eq .",
    "( [ evolve1 ] ) , if the photon is transmitted and in the output2 , the original state collapses to @xmath38 then alice lets her photon pass through the hwp@xmath39 and pbs@xmath40 .",
    "the hwp@xmath39 makes latexmath:[\\ ] ] where @xmath95 represents the coupling constant .",
    "@xmath96 is the @xmath97 dipole decay rate . @xmath98 and @xmath99 are the cavity field decay rate into the input and output modes and the leaky rate , respectively .     for alice performing this ecp shown in eq .",
    "( [ probability4 ] ) .",
    "we chose @xmath87 and @xmath100 .",
    "curve a is the idea case with no leakage and curve b represents the success probability with @xmath101 , @xmath89 , and @xmath90.,width=302 ]    if we consider the condition that the resonant interaction with @xmath102 , and @xmath103 , we can get the reflection and transmission coefficients as @xmath104 the transmission and reflection operators can be rewritten as @xmath105 ) .",
    "we chose @xmath87 and @xmath100 .",

    "we chose @xmath87 .",
    "curve a is the idea case with no leakage .",
    "curve b is the success probability with @xmath101 , @xmath89 and @xmath90.,width=302 ]    we calculated the success probability of this ecp for different @xmath32 in the coupled system .",
    "3 illustrates the success probability @xmath108 shown in eq .",
    "( [ probability6 ] ) for obtaining the maximally entangled w state .",
    "we chose @xmath87 and changed @xmath100 .",
    "it is shown that in the idea case without leakage , the success probability can reach 0.25 when @xmath110 .",
    "but in a practical condition that @xmath88 , the max value @xmath111 , when @xmath110 .",
    "we also calculated the success probability when @xmath101 , shown in fig .",
    "4 , fig . 5 and fig . 6 . in fig .",
    "4 , it is the success probability for alice performing this ecp one time in both the idea case and with the leakage @xmath101 .",
    "it is shown that in the idea case , the max value can reach 0.5 and it can reach @xmath112 when @xmath101 .",
    "interestingly , the success probability shown in eqs .",
    "( [ probability2 ] ) and ( [ probability5 ] ) for charlie remains almost unchanged when @xmath113 with @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "but both @xmath116 and @xmath117 decrease rapidly when @xmath118 . actually , when @xmath87 , eqs .",
    "( [ probability2 ] ) and ( [ probability5 ] ) can be simplified as @xmath119 and @xmath120 in fig .",
    "6 we calculated the success probability for obtaining a maximally entangled w state when @xmath101 . compared with fig .",
    "3 , the success probability decreases .",
    "the max value is about @xmath121 .",
    "in this ecp , the system can be realized in a self - assembled gaas quantum dot or an inas interface quantum dot in micropillar microcavities .",
    "therefore , the long coherence of quantum dots and the strong coupling of the quantum dots with the cavity are required .",
    "it is reported that the coupling strength is acceptable for @xmath122 in a microcavity with a diameter of @xmath123 with the cavity leakage@xcite . in 2008 ,",
    "press _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated the optical initialization , rotation by arbitrary angle and projective measurement of an electron spin in a quantum dot@xcite .",
    "they showed that coherence time is 3.0 @xmath124 and about @xmath125 operations can be achieved within the qubit s coherent time .",
    "et al . _ also reported their experiment about ultrafast optical rotation of spins about arbitrary axes on a picosecond timescale using laser pulses as control fields@xcite .",
    "current experiment also demonstrated that the spin coherent time @xmath126 due to the suppressed electron - photon interaction and the lack of hole - nuclear hyperfine interaction@xcite .",
    "the cooling and fast coherent control of hole - spin states were also reported@xcite . in 2010 ,",
    "press _ et al .",
    "_ increased decoherence time of a single quantum dot electron spin from nonaseconds to microseconds using ultrafast all - optical spin echo technique@xcite .    in summary",
    ", we exploit the single photons to concentrate the less - entangled w state for the charge qubits confined in the quantum dots .",
    "this ecp is quite different from the other protocols because this ecp is performed between different physical qubits , i.e. the charge qubits and the photons , while other protocols unusually use the same physical qubits .",
    "it provides us a good way to realize such ecp .",
    "moreover , during this ecp , we only require one pair of less - entangled w states while the conventional ecps should resorts two same copies of such states .",
    "therefore , this ecp seems more optimal . on the other hand",
    ", this protocol can be repeated to obtain a high success probability by consuming some single photons .",
    "our protocol may be useful and flexible in current quantum information processing .",
