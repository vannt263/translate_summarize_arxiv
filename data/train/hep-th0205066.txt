    "the nature of the correspondence between gauge theories and string theory is one of the longstanding problems in modern theoretical physics .",
    "significant progress was achieved in @xcite where the ads / cft correspondence was proposed . the ads / cft correspondence relates the weak coupling limit of the string theory to the strong coupling limit of gauge theory , and vice versa .",
    "on one hand , this correspondence is useful because it teaches us about the strong coupling behavior of gauge theories ( and probably the strong coupling limit of string theory ) .",
    "but on the other hand , it is often difficult to fully exploit the duality .",
    "it is hard to quantize the superstring theory in @xmath11 , and therefore the calculations on the ads side usually do not go beyond the low energy supergravity approximation . also , it is hard to find independent confirmation of the correspondence beyond the agreement of those amplitudes that are protected by supersymmetry .",
    "an interesting proposal was made in @xcite , relating a particular sector of the gauge theory to string theory in a plane wave background .",
    "this can be considered a particular case of the ads / cft correspondence , because a plane wave is a limit of ads .",
    "the weakly coupled string theory is still mapped to the strongly coupled yang - mills in a sense that the t  hooft coupling constant is large .",
    "however it turns out that in many calculations the effective coupling constant of the yang - mills theory is not the t  hooft coupling @xmath12 but rather the product @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a small number .",
    "this allows perturbative computations to be extended to the large @xmath1 region .",
    "when @xmath13 is small , the correspondence of @xcite maps some perturbative computations on the yang - mills side to superstring perturbation theory .",
    "moreover , it turns out that the string worldsheet sigma - model is exactly solvable in the plane wave background @xcite,@xcite-@xcite .",
    "this allowed the authors of @xcite to construct the explicit map between the string states and gauge invariant operators in the yang - mills theory .",
    "the proposal of @xcite was subsequently extended to other gauge / gravity dualities .",
    "backgrounds with minimal supersymmetry were first discussed in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the penrose limits of orbifolds of @xmath11 were discussed in @xcite-@xcite and the operators dual to elementary string excitations were also constructed . other spaces , arising from brane intersections @xcite , @xcite , spaces describing gauge theory rg flows @xcite and the randall - sundrum scenario @xcite were analyzed . string couplings to d - branes were studied in @xcite confirming the conjectured correspondence between string modes with high r - charge and superyang - mills operators .",
    "interactions of strings in a plane wave background were discussed in @xcite where propagators and closed string vertices were constructed .",
    "first steps towards the derivation of the string interactions from the field theory were taken in @xcite .",
    "the interesting question of holography in plane wave background was attacked from various perspectives in @xcite , @xcite .      once the correspondence is established , the first nontrivial check is whether the conformal dimension of the operator is in agreement with the mass of the corresponding superstring state @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite invented a beautiful trick which allowed them to compute the anomalous dimension of certain non - bps operator exactly in perturbation theory .",
    "they have found complete agreement with the string theory calculation .",
    "but their argument relied on a certain assumption about the behavior of anomalous dimensions in the yang - mills theory in the strong coupling limit , which itself follows from the ads / cft correspondence and has not been independently verified .",
    "we will now review the arguments of @xcite .",
    "the crucial ingredient in the bmn proposal is the observation that single trace operators with parametrically large r - charge can be put in one to one correspondence with _ physical _ string states .",
    "the construction of the plane wave limit on @xmath11 isolates an @xmath15 subgroup of the @xmath16 r - symmetry group .",
    "furthermore , the limit keeps a subset of the ym operators those with @xmath15 charge of the order of the square of the @xmath17 radius , i.e. of the order @xmath18 .",
    "the bps bound then implies that the operators kept in the limit are those with conformal dimension @xmath19 of the order @xmath18 .",
    "it is then natural to collect together operators with the same difference @xmath20 .    as a limit of @xmath11 ,",
    "the plane wave background is supported by a ( null ) rr flux . as usual",
    ", the quantization of the nsr string in such a background is problematic .",
    "however , one can use the gs model constructed for @xmath11 as a starting point .",
    "taking the plane wave limit here leads to substantial simplifications . choosing light - cone gauge for @xmath21-symmetry leads to a quadratic action which is easily quantizable",
    "this approach was pursued in @xcite , where the spectrum was constructed , with the result that acting with a level @xmath22 creation operator on some state adds @xmath23 to the mass of the ground state .",
    "according to the usual ads / cft philosophy one should match this with the anomalous dimension of the operator dual to this state .",
    "written in terms of the parameters of the yang - mills theory the anomalous dimension predicted by the string theory formula ( [ stringprediction ] ) is : @xmath24 the authors of @xcite suggested an elegant way to compute the anomalous dimension of nearly bps operators in @xmath0 theory which gives the answer in agreement with ( [ yangmills ] ) .",
    "anomalous dimensions of operators are the same as the energies of the corresponding states in the field theory on @xmath25 .",
    "the proposal of @xcite is to reduce the field theory to quantum mechanics by taking into account only zero modes on @xmath26 .",
    "then one computes the corrections to the ground state energy in quantum mechanical perturbation theory .",
    "how this works can be understood , for example , from the second order correction to the energy : @xmath27 in principle , this correction receives contributions from all states @xmath28 orthogonal to @xmath29 .",
    "however , the contribution is suppressed by the inverse of the energy of the state . the standard ads / cft correspondence tells us that states which involve nonzero modes on @xmath26 have a very large energy in the strong coupling limit .",
    "therefore the contribution of these states to ( [ qmsum ] ) is very small and we can neglect them . neglecting the states created by the nonzero modes of the yang - mills fields on @xmath26 should be equivalent to dimensionally reducing the yang - mills theory down to quantum mechanics .",
    "this is summarized in the following cartoon where the box stands for the corrections that remove the massive spectrum resulting from the reduction of the ym theory on @xmath26 :      the correpondence between the gauge theory and the plane wave background was derived from the ads / cft correspondence using the supergravity approximation on the ads side .",
    "when the t hooft coupling parameter is small the supergravity approximation breaks down .",
    "however one can conjecture that the bmn state is still approximated by the string moving in the pp - wave background , even though this was derived in the supergravity approximation .",
    "this would imply that the formula ( [ yangmills ] ) is reproduced by the standard t hooft perturbative expansion .",
    "the authors of @xcite also used the perturbative expansion to derive ( [ yangmills ] ) on the cft side , but that was not the yang - mills perturbative expansion . in their argument",
    "it was essential that one first makes the dimensional reduction from the @xmath30 dimensional yang - mills theory to the @xmath31 dimensional quantum mechanics .",
    "in fact it turns out that after the dimensional reduction the perturbative expansion is justified even when @xmath32 is large .",
    "one finds that the small parameter governing the series expansion is in fact not @xmath1 but rather @xmath33 .",
    "this is due to the locality of the quantum mechanical hamiltonian .",
    "the bmn hamiltonian @xmath34 contains a maximum of two derivatives after taking the continuum limit . and @xmath35 appears only multiplying the square of the lattice spacing .",
    "( this is the reason why the continuum limit exists . )",
    "this simple form of the hamiltonian is in turn due to the simplicity of the feynman diagramms with the non - zero modes projected out .    in principle one",
    "can imagine that taking into account the massive states leads to some more complicated hamiltonian for which the continuum limit does not exist .",
    "for example , a perturbation of the form @xmath36 ^ 2\\ ] ] would become infinitely strong in the bmn regime , invalidating the perturbation theory .",
    "suppose that we work at weak t  hooft coupling , and write down order by order in perturbation theory the effective hamiltonian governing the renormalization of the composite operator .",
    "is it true that this effective hamiltonian will have a nice continuum limit , or will it contain terms like ( [ badperturbation ] ) ?    in our paper",
    "we verify that in the lowest nontrivial order of perturbation theory ( two loops ) the renormalization does indeed have a continuum limit .",
    "we find that the anomalous dimension of the operator dual to the string state is indeed a function of @xmath1 and @xmath37 in the combination @xmath38 .",
    "we then assume that this is true to higher orders of perturbation theory . by summing up an infinite subset of feynman diagrams",
    "we show that , under this assumption , the anomalous dimension of the operator is indeed given by ( [ yangmills ] ) .",
    "our results provide evidence for the conjecture that the correspondence between gauge fields and strings proposed in @xcite works in perturbation theory .",
    "we should stress that there have been a number of interesting papers on perturbation theory for @xmath0 yang - mills in the context of the ads / cft correspondence .",
    "in particular , a remarkable computation of the circular wilson loops to all orders in perturbation theory was performed in @xcite .",
    "the absence of the perturbative corrections in the order @xmath39 to the two and three point functions of the chiral primary operators was demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "two point functions of chiral primary operators were computed to the order @xmath40 in @xcite .",
    "a perturbative computation of the correlation functions of the bps operators at two loop order was performed in superspace in @xcite .",
    "the superspace approach to the computation of the anomalous dimension of the composite operators was developed in @xcite .",
    "the maximally supersymmetric yang - mills theory contains six real scalars which we denote @xmath41 .",
    "let us concentrate on a @xmath42 subgroup of the @xmath16 r - symmetry group which rotates @xmath43 and leaves the other four scalars invariant .",
    "it is natural to construct @xmath44 , which has unit charge with respect to this subgroup .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that the penrose limit of the ads geometry corresponds , on the gauge theory side , to focusing on the set of operators with large r - charge .",
    "more precisely , the @xmath42-component of the @xmath45 charge should be very large while the other components should be of order one . from this perspective",
    "the ground state of the string can be put in correspondence with the bps operator @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "other massless modes as well as excited string modes correspond to inserting @xmath48 and @xmath49 into the `` string '' of @xmath50 s in a very specific way .",
    "it is further assumed that the number of such insertions is small .",
    "one of the many possible operators obtained in this way is @xmath51 where we have inserted two @xmath14 fields .",
    "we will use a schematic notation for such operators which is shown in figure [ operators ] .",
    "an insertion of a composite operator will be denoted by a horizontal line .",
    "its intersection points with other lines are understood as being at the same space - time point .",
    "we will be interested in computing the anomalous dimensions of operators dual to excited string states .",
    "starting from the requirement that these operators have definite anomalous dimensions and from the assumption @xcite that they are linear combinations of the operators described above , we will recover the full set of operators conjectured in @xcite .",
    "an aspect of renormalization of composite operators that often appears in ordinary quantum field theories is operator mixing : the divergences in 1pi diagrams with one insertion of a composite operator generally contain divergences proportional to other composite operators .",
    "thus , all composite operators must be renormalized at the same time , order by order in perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , one has to take into account the usual field and coupling constant renormalization .",
    "this leads to the following    renormalization : @xmath52 where @xmath53 denotes a generic field , we assume the existence of a cubic @xmath53 interaction of strength @xmath54 and @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the usual wave function and coupling constant @xmath50-factors",
    ".    we will proceed by considering the operators @xmath57 introduced above , but the arguments generalize immediately to more complicated ones . to cancel divergencies in the proper graphs with one @xmath58 insertion we need to add as counterterms local operators with the same engineering dimension and r - charge as @xmath58 . however , the only operators with r - charge @xmath59 and dimension @xmath60 are of the type @xmath61 for some @xmath22 .",
    "this implies that the counterterms needed to cancel divergences in a 1pi graph with one insertion of @xmath58 will be linear combinations of @xmath61 .",
    "it is not hard to see that , for @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 sufficiently large , planar diagrams are invariant under @xmath65 .",
    "thus , all counterterms should have this symmetry .",
    "this observation implies that the only operator which is multiplicatively renormalized is , up to overall normalization , @xmath66 for which equation ( [ renormalization ] ) becomes @xmath67 standard manipulations now imply that the anomalous dimension @xmath68 is : @xmath69 for later convenience let us introduce the notation @xmath70 in the expansion @xmath71 the coefficients @xmath72 are functions of @xmath73 : @xmath74 the coefficient @xmath75 can be easily computed in perturbation theory for arbitrary @xmath76 , because only one diagram contributes to it .",
    "for example , the contribution to @xmath77 is given by the graph in figure [ c33 ] .",
    "we will compute the contribution of these diagrams in section 5 .      in equation ( [ stringprediction ] )",
    "the anomalous dimension depends on @xmath78 and the t  hooft coupling in the combination @xmath79 .",
    "if ( [ stringprediction ] ) is satisfied order by order in yang - mills perturbation theory this would mean that @xmath80 in other words @xmath81 in section [ 2loops ] we will compute the coefficients @xmath82 and @xmath83 and show that the conjecture ( [ coefconj ] ) holds at the two loop level .",
    "the lagrangian of the @xmath0 yang - mills theory can be derived in a number of ways . in the following",
    "we will use the form that arises by dimensionally - reducing ten - dimensional super - yang - mills theory on a six - dimensional torus : @xmath84 + \\left .",
    "2 a_{\\mu}(\\phi^i\\stackrel{\\leftrightarrow}{\\partial}\\phi^i)+ \\bar{\\psi}[\\hat{a},\\psi]+\\bar{\\psi}\\gamma^i[\\phi^i,\\psi]+ { 1\\over 2}[\\phi^i,\\phi^j]^2+{1\\over 2}[a_{\\mu},a_{\\nu}]^2\\right\\ } \\end{array}\\ ] ] rewriting this lagrangian in terms of @xmath44 , introduced in the previous section , we find that the two - point functions of fields @xmath14 are @xmath85 and the two - point function of @xmath50 is @xmath86 . the set of relevant feynman rules is summarized in figure [ rules ] .",
    "we choose to work in feynman gauge due to the simplicity of the gauge boson propagator .",
    "one can use a general renormalizable gauge as the result is independent of the choice of gauge .",
    "perturbation theory is an expansion in @xmath87 where the denominator arises from integrals over loop momenta . to simplify notation",
    "we will include this factor in the coupling constant from the outset .",
    "thus , in our notation the loop integrals look like : @xmath88^{\\epsilon}}~~.\\ ] ] we have further absorbed a factor of @xmath89 into @xmath90 making it dimensionless . at higher loops",
    "other integrals become useful and they will be introduced as we go along .",
    "we are now ready to compute the one - loop contribution to the anomalous dimensions of the operators introduced in @xcite and described in detail in section [ generalandim ] .      before we proceed with the calculations we want to discuss the role of the `` dilute gas '' assumption which is appropriate when @xmath47 .",
    "as discussed in section [ generalandim ] we consider operators with a small number of @xmath14-fields . in low orders of perturbation theory",
    "it is easy to see that the diagrams responsible for the anomalous dimension of @xmath91 involve essentially only the @xmath14 fields and a few @xmath50 fields next to the @xmath14 insertion .",
    "this implies that , for small enough number of loops , it is enough to study operators with exactly one @xmath14-field .",
    "such an operator vanishes due to the cyclicity of the trace .",
    "therefore , to obtain a meaningful result we write the operator as @xmath92 even though this operator is not gauge invariant , it is meaningful to discuss it because for a small enough number of loops the required counterterms are proportional to @xmath91 .",
    "it can be interpreted as a building block for operators with a larger number of @xmath14 insertions .",
    "if @xmath63 is finite , then there is the danger that at @xmath63 loops two @xmath14 fields arrive next to each other invalidating the initial assumption of a `` dilute gas '' .",
    "in fact , we do expect such `` contact '' terms to affect the anomalous dimension .",
    "for example , consider the operator with two insertions of @xmath14 symmetrized over the positions of @xmath14 .",
    "the `` bulk '' contribution to the anomalous dimension of such an operator is zero .",
    "( indeed , the bulk contribution is just twice the anomalous dimension of @xmath93 which vanishes because @xmath93 is bps . ) but the operator with two insertions of @xmath14 is not bps , therefore it should acquire an anomalous dimension . we expect that this anomalous dimension arises precisely from diagramms with the two @xmath14 s appearing next to each other .",
    "since we e neglect the contact terms , we can only say that our result for the anomalous dimension is correct up to , roughly , the @xmath63-th order of perturbation theory .",
    "let us now proceed with the one loop computation .",
    "there are two classes of diagrams , with the exchange of @xmath50 and @xmath14 and without the exchange .",
    "we will start by computing the former .",
    "there is exactly one diagram which mixes the original operator with operators in which @xmath14 is moved one site to the left or to the right .",
    "the amplitude is : @xmath94&&= \\lambda e^{i\\varphi}\\left[{1\\over\\epsilon } + 2-c+\\log{1\\over 4 p^2}\\right ] \\label{ex}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we now turn to diagrams not exchanging @xmath50 and @xmath14 .",
    "these can be split again in two subclasses .",
    "the first subclass involves interactions of @xmath14 and @xmath50 while the second one contains only interactions among @xmath50-fields .",
    "there are two diagrams in the first subclass ( fig .",
    "the first one , like the diagram discussed above , arises from the four - scalar interaction .",
    "the second one has a gluon exchange .    to find the anomalous dimension , we need only the divergent part .",
    "the divergent part of the scalar diagram is minus the divergent part of the diagram with the vector exchange and therefore the sum of these two diagrams is finite .",
    "as for the diagrams with two @xmath50 lines there are again two of them ; the diagram with a four scalar interaction and the diagram with a gluon exchange .",
    "they both appear with the same sign , and the divergent part is @xmath95    to summarize , we need the following counterterms :    @xmath96 one counterterm in which @xmath14 is moved one site to the right ( figure [ exct ] ) .    its value is equal to @xmath97 .",
    "@xmath96 one counterterm in which @xmath14 is moved one site to the left , which is the complex conjugate of the above one .",
    "@xmath96 @xmath98 counterterms with interactions between two @xmath50 lines in which @xmath14 keeps its original position .",
    "they are due to interactions among @xmath50-fields ( figure [ zct ] ) .",
    "each such counterterm is equal to @xmath99 .",
    "putting together equations ( [ ex ] ) and ( [ znoex ] ) it is not hard to see that we will cancel the divergence in the diagrams containing one insertion of @xmath91 if we define the renormalized @xmath100 in equation ( [ renop ] ) as : @xmath101 the last step is finding the wave function renormalization @xmath102 and @xmath103 . the full correction to",
    "the propagator will turn out to be useful in the two loop computation so we will write it down in detail .",
    "let us start with computing the one loop correction to the propagator of the scalar field ( @xmath14 or @xmath50 ) .",
    "there are three diagrams @xmath104 = { 1\\over p^2}-2\\lambda\\left[{1\\over\\epsilon}+2-c\\right ]   { 1\\over ( p^2)^{1+\\epsilon}}\\ ] ] where the first term in parentheses comes from a gauge boson loop , the second one from a fermion loop while the third one from a scalar tadpole .",
    "therefore the renormalization of the propagator is : @xmath105 combining the analogue of the equation ( [ renop ] ) for the operator considered here ( only one insertion of @xmath14 ) with equations ( [ zo ] ) and ( [ 1loopscalarprop ] ) we find that @xmath106 which implies that the one loop contribution to the anomalous dimension of the operator @xmath91 is @xmath107 in accord with equation ( [ conjecture ] ) .",
    "the fact that @xmath108 depends on @xmath1 only as @xmath109 is at one loop level a consequence of supersymmetry .",
    "we are now ready to discuss the two loop contribution to the anomalous dimension .",
    "as discussed in section ( [ generalandim ] ) , the two loop contribution to anomalous dimensions has a natural expansion in terms of @xmath110 as @xmath111 in the next subsection we will compute the last coefficient , @xmath83 .",
    "we will continue by computing @xmath82 and finish by extracting @xmath112 from the fact that , for @xmath113 , the operator @xmath114 is bps and thus has vanishing anomalous dimension .      as stated in section [ generalandim ]",
    ", there is just one diagram contributing to @xmath83 .",
    "this diagram involves only interactions of scalar fields and is shown in figure [ e2iphi ] .",

    "such precision is enough for the computation of anomalous dimensions at this order , and therefore @xmath121 is , for our purposes , a function of @xmath122 : @xmath123^{\\epsilon+1}(q-(p_2+p_3))^2 } = \\nonumber\\\\[5pt]= \\lambda^2 e^{2i\\varphi}{1\\over   [ ( p_2+p_3)^2]^{2\\epsilon } } { 1\\over\\epsilon(1 - 2\\epsilon)}{\\gamma(2\\epsilon)\\gamma(1-\\epsilon)^3\\over \\gamma(2 - 3\\epsilon)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] subtracting the counterterm in figure [ exct ] we arrive at a local divergence : @xmath124~~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can easily extract from here the contribution to @xmath83 .",
    "we will , however , postpone this to the end of this section when we will find the full two - loop result .",
    "the set of diagrams leading to a shift in the position of @xmath14 by one site can be naturally decomposed in three disjoint sets : diagrams with only two interacting legs , diagrams with three interacting legs and diagrams with disconnected one - loop graphs .",
    "once the counterterms are included , the three sets of diagrams lead only to local divergences .",
    "this is the case since there are no one - loop counterterm graphs mixing any two of the three sets of diagrams .",
    "we should take into account the contribution of the fermions . in computing the fermionic loops we will use the dimensional regularization via the dimensional reduction which was first suggested in @xcite .",
    "it uses the four - dimensional algebra of gamma - matrices and four - dimensional tensor algebra , but the momenta are taken to be @xmath125-dimensional .",
    "this regularization is consistent at low orders of perturbation theory as long as antisymmetric levi - civita tensors are not present , and manifestly preserves supersymmetry .",
    "( see the discussion in @xcite . )",
    "we will begin by computing the diagrams with `` two interacting legs '' shown in figure [ 2leg ] .    in this figure",

    "one way of determining them is doing the explicit computation and finding the contribution of diagrams with no exchange of @xmath50 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is a rather tedious exercise , since the number of diagrams is substantially larger than those considered by now .",

    "however , _ assuming _ that the conjecture ( [ conjecture ] ) holds , we can actually derive the anomalous dimension to all orders in perturbation theory .",
    "the idea is that , given this assumption , there is exactly one relevant diagram per loop order . in this section",
    "we will compute all these diagrams . we will sum these graphs and argue that the anomalous dimension is indeed given by ( [ yangmills ] ) .      by briefly studying the diagrams at an arbitrary loop order @xmath165",

    ", this diagram gives the only contribution to the anomalous dimension at l loops .",
    "we will now compute the contribution of figure [ arbitorder ] . in principle",
    "one should put arbitrary momenta on external lines .",
    "however , as long as infrared divergences are not encountered , we can make further simplifying assumptions , in particular , we can set some momenta to zero since this does not change the divergent part . in figure [ arbitorder ]",

    "the perturbative expansion is still valid even though the t  hooft parameter is large . on the other hand",
    ", a large thooft parameter implies that the calculation can be done in the dual picture , namely string theory in a plane wave background .",
    "this means that the perturbative computation in the field theory can be compared with the perturbative computation on the string worldsheet .",
    "we have partialy summed the perturbation series and found that the result for the anomalous dimension is indeed equal to the mass of the string excitation .",
