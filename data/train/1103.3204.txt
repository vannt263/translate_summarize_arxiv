    ", whose solution is simply h_0=c_1r^2 .",
    "the system of perturbation equations of both parity can be reduced to a second - order differential equation for a single perturbation function , the remaining ones being determined either algebraically or by differentiation .",
    "such a master equation can be cast in general in the form of a heun equation @xcite [ heun ] + ( + + ) + y=0 , where @xmath125 are complex arbitrary parameters such that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "this equation has four regular singular points , at @xmath128 .",
    "this is a generalization of the hypergeometric equation .",
    "in fact , in the special case where @xmath129 and @xmath130 , eq .",

    "the coupled system ( [ eqsele2a])([eqsele2b ] ) is equivalent to solve a second - order differential equation for @xmath32 of the heun type .",

    "the signs have to be chosen so as to avoid singular behaviours at @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the same procedure outlined above for the case of electric multipoles can be followed here to reduce the coupled system ( [ eqsmagn2a])([eqsmagn2b ] ) to a second - order differential equation for @xmath60 of the heun type .",
    "first , eliminate @xmath59 in favour of @xmath60 , then introduce the new variable @xmath131 and a rescaling @xmath140 of the form ( [ rescaling ] ) .",
    "the function @xmath132 thus satisfies an equation of the form ( [ heun ] ) with parameters @xmath141 and _ 1 = 34+,_2 = -1-i_2,_3 = 0 , implying that @xmath129 .",

    "the kovacic algorithm applies to a second - order ordinary differential equation of normal form [ 2ordnf ] = w(r)y , when @xmath142 is a given element of @xmath143 , the field of rational functions with coefficients in the field of complex numbers .",
    "kovacic proved that all liouvillian solutions to eq .",
    "( [ 2ordnf ] ) belong to three mutually exclusive types .",
    "furthermore , for each type , he provided an algorithm which determines whether a liouvillian solution exists for that type , and constructs the solution in case it does exist .",
    "the types are as follows :    * the differential equation has a solution of the form @xmath144 , where @xmath145 . *",
    "the differential equation has a solution of the form @xmath144 , where @xmath101 is algebraic over @xmath143 of degree 2 ( i.e. , @xmath101 is a solution of a polynomial equation of degree 2 with coefficients in @xmath143 ) , and solutions of type @xmath146 form an empty set . *",
    "all solutions of the differential equation are algebraic over @xmath143 of degree @xmath106 , and solutions of type @xmath146 and @xmath106 form two empty sets .",
    "if none of the previous cases applies , the differential equation has no liouvillian solution .",
    "the construction of each type of liouvillian solution is derived from the pole structure of the rational function .",
    "kovacic also discussed some conditions that are necessary for cases 1 , 2 or 3 to hold . for type 1",
    "every pole of @xmath142 should have even order or else order 1 , and the pole at @xmath147 should have either even order or order greater than 2 . for type 2",
    "a necessary condition is that @xmath142 must have at least one pole that has either odd order greater than 2 or order 2 .",
    "last , for type 3 the order of a pole of @xmath142 can not exceed 2 , and the order of the pole at @xmath147 must be at least 2 .",

    "( [ 2ordnf ] ) are determined in the following way .",
    "a finite set of constants @xmath148 is derived algorithmically from the pole structure of @xmath142 and for each @xmath148 a function @xmath149 is also constructed . if any @xmath148 is a non - negative integer @xmath150 and , for the corresponding @xmath149 , the differential equation [ eqpdir ] + 2 + ( r ) = 0 has a polynomial solution @xmath108 of degree @xmath150 , then eq .

    "since @xmath142 depends on different independent parameters , several different pole structures may occur by imposing conditions on the parameters which alter the order of poles .",
