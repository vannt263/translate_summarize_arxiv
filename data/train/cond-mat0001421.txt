    "the oxide sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 has a structure similar to high @xmath5 materials and was observed to be superconducting by maeno _",
    "et al . _ in 1994 @xcite .",
    "it has been established that this superconductor is not a conventional @xmath6-wave superconductor : nqr measurements show no indication of a hebel - slichter peak in @xmath7 @xcite , and @xmath5 is strongly suppressed below the maximum value of 1.5 k by non - magnetic impurities @xcite .",
    "more recent experiments indicate an odd parity gap function of the form @xmath8 .",
    "the knight shift measurements of ishida _ et al . _",
    "@xcite reveal that the spin susceptibility is unchanged upon entering the superconducting state ; this is consistent with @xmath2-wave superconductivity ( as predicted by rice and sigrist @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , these measurements were conducted with the applied field in the basal plane . since the orientation of the gap function ( that is @xmath9 ) is orthogonal to the spin projection of the cooper pair @xcite ,",
    "these measurements are consistent with the gap function aligned along the @xmath10 direction .",
    "the @xmath11sr experiments of luke _ et .",
    "al . _ have revealed spontaneous fields in the meissner state @xcite .",
    "this indicates that the superconducting order parameter must have more than one component @xcite .",
    "naively , the observation of spontaneous fields leads to the conclusion that the superconducting gap function breaks time reversal symmetry ( @xmath12 ) and therefore must have the form @xmath13 .",
    "however , the muons probe inhomogeneities in the superconducting state since any bulk magnetic fields are screened in the meissner state .",
    "consequently , @xmath12 need only be broken in the vicinity of the inhomogeneities .",
    "for example , it has been pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that a gap function given by @xmath14 can give rise to domain walls that break time reversal symmetry . in principle",
    "this can also lead to a @xmath11sr signal as seen by luke _",
    "et al._. consequently , these two experiments lead to the gap function @xmath8 , with the specific form of the order parameter @xmath15 and @xmath16 undetermined . in this talk ,",
    "the vortex lattice structures arising in the phenomenological theory of this @xmath3 representation are examined .",
    "first , the theory is examined for an applied magnetic field in the basal plane along one of the two - fold symmetry axes .",
    "it is shown that multiple vortex lattice phases are generic to this representation .",
    "then the weak - coupling limit of the theory is examined for the applied magnetic field along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "it is shown that a square vortex lattice results for parameters relevant to sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ; consistent with the experimental observation of a square vortex lattice @xcite .",
    "the theory of the square vortex lattice is compared with the observed results and good agreement is found .",
    "the dimensionless free energy for the @xmath3 representation of @xmath4 is given by @xcite @xmath18 \\nonumber   \\\\ & + \\kappa_4[(\\tilde{d}_y\\eta_x)(\\tilde{d}_x\\eta_y)^*+h.c . ] + h^2/(8\\pi ) .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the vector potential .",
    "the stable homogeneous solutions are easily determined .",
    "there are three phases : ( a ) @xmath22 ( @xmath23 and @xmath24 ) , ( b ) @xmath25 ( @xmath26 and @xmath27 ) , and ( c ) @xmath28 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) . phase ( a ) is nodeless and phases ( b ) and ( c ) have line nodes .",
    "for some of the discussion in this paper the ginzburg landau coefficients are determined within a weak - coupling approximation in the clean limit . in this case , taking for the @xmath31 rep the gap function described by the pseudo - spin - pairing gap matrix : @xmath32\\sigma_z \\sigma_y$ ] , where the brackets @xmath33 denote an average over the fermi surface and @xmath34 are the pauli matrices , it is found that @xcite @xmath35 and @xmath36 where @xmath37 note that @xmath38 and @xmath39 for a spherical or a cylindrical fermi surface .",
    "also note that @xmath40 is the stable homogeneous state for all @xmath41 .",
    "for the @xmath3 model , symmetry arguments imply that the vortex lattice phase diagram contains at least two vortex lattice phases for magnetic fields applied along at least two of the four two - fold symmetry axes @xcite . to demonstrate this , consider the magnetic field along the @xmath42 direction ( @xmath42 is chosen to be along the crystal @xmath43 axis ) and a homogeneous zero - field state @xmath40 .",
    "the presence of a magnetic field along the @xmath42 direction breaks the degeneracy of the @xmath44 components , so that only one of these two components will order at the upper critical field [ _ e.g. _ @xmath45 .",
    "it has been shown for type ii superconductors with a single component order parameter that the solution is independent of @xmath46 @xcite so that @xmath47 ( a reflection about the @xmath42 direction ) is a symmetry operation of the @xmath48 vortex phase .",
    "now consider the zero - field phase @xmath40 ; @xmath47 transforms @xmath49 to @xmath50 where @xmath51 is phase factor .",
    "this implies that @xmath47 is _ not _ a symmetry operator of the zero - field phase .",
    "it follows that there must exist a second transition in the finite field phase at which @xmath15 becomes non - zero .",
    "similar arguments hold for the field along any of the other three two - fold symmetry directions in the basal plane .",
    "consequently a zero - field state @xmath40 must exhibit two vortex lattice phases when the field is applied along any of the four two - fold symmetry axes .",
    "similar arguments for @xmath52 or @xmath53 .",
    "imply that there must exist at least two vortex lattice phases for only two of the four two - fold symmetry axes .",
    "for a zero - field state @xmath25 fields along the @xmath54 or the @xmath55 directions will result in two vortex lattice phases ( for the @xmath56 and the @xmath57 directions multiple vortex lattice phases may exist , but are not required by symmetry ) .",
    "for a zero - field state @xmath53 , two vortex lattice phases will exist for fields along the @xmath56 or the @xmath57 directions .",
    "an analysis of the free energy of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] reveals additional information about the phase diagram @xcite . assuming the large @xmath58 limit ( note @xmath59 for this field orientation in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath1 ) , the vector potential can be taken to be @xmath60 ( @xmath61 is the angle in the basal plane that the applied magnetic field makes with the @xmath42 direction ) .",
    "the component of @xmath62 along the field is set to zero .",
    "the upper critical field found by this method exhibits a four - fold anisotropy in the basal plane @xcite . for concreteness ,",
    "the field is taken along the @xmath42 direction ( @xmath63 ) . introducing the raising and lowering operators @xmath64 with @xmath65 , the gradient portion of the free energy",
    "can be written as @xmath66\\eta_x + \\eta_y^*[(\\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{1}{2\\kappa_2})\\nonumber \\\\ & ( 1 + 2n)+(\\frac{1}{2\\kappa_2}-\\frac{1}{2 } ) ( \\pi_+^2+\\pi_-^2)]\\eta_y\\}\\nonumber.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that @xmath67 the first transition is given by the standard hexagonal abrikosov vortex lattice solution for @xmath15 . to find the second transition the lowest eigenstate of @xmath68 must be found ( where @xmath69 has been introduced so that the vortex lattice can be rotated with respect to the ionic lattice ) and a vortex lattice solution for @xmath16 must be constructed from this .",
    "note that the zeroes of the @xmath15 lattice and the zeroes of the @xmath16 lattice need not coincide @xcite .",
    "this method yields for the ratio of the second transition ( @xmath70 ) to the upper critical field ( @xmath71 ) @xmath72 where @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , the over - bar denotes a spatial average , and @xmath77 must be minimized with respect to @xmath69 and the displacement between the zeros of the @xmath15 and the @xmath16 lattices .",
    "diagrams of the predicted vortex structures are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] and the phase diagram for the weak - coupling limit is shown in fig .",
    "two vortex lattice configurations are found to be stable as a function of @xmath41 .",
    "for @xmath78 ( phase 1 ) , the displacement between the the zeroes of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lattices is one half of a hexagonal lattice basis vector and @xmath69 varies with @xmath41 ( and in general with field and temperature ) so that the vortex lattice is not aligned with the ionic lattice . for @xmath79 ( phase 2 ) , the @xmath15 and @xmath16 lattices coincide and a vortex lattice basis vector lies along the @xmath80 direction .",
    "kita @xcite has argued that for phase 1 , at some field below @xmath70 there will be a first order transition from phase 1 to phase 2 . for the field along @xmath81",
    "the phase diagram is given by replacing @xmath41 with @xmath82 .",
    "recent experiments of mao _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite show some support for the theory presented here .",
    "the free energy in eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] in the weak coupling limit has been used to determine the vortex lattice structure for the field along the @xmath17-axis for fields near the upper critical field @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion of this analysis is that vortex lattice is square for @xmath83 and that the vortex lattice is oriented along the crystal lattice for @xmath84 and rotated 45 degrees from the crystal lattice for @xmath85 .",
    "the analysis near @xmath86 has also been carried out with the result that the vortex lattice at @xmath86 will be hexagonal and with increasing field the lattice will continuously distort until a square vortex lattice is formed @xcite . a square vortex lattice has been observed by small angle neutron scattering ( sans ) and the orientation implies @xmath85 @xcite .",
    "one notable feature of the sans measurements is the observation of bragg peaks beyond the first bragg peak .",
    "the analysis of eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] has been extended to fields below @xmath71 and the lowest bragg peaks of the field distribution have been calculated and compared to experiment .",
    "one comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( note that in the sans measurements there is flux pinning which is not included in the calculations ) . the large size of the higher order bragg peaks relative to that expected for a single complex order parameter component ( abrikosov ) theory and the agreement between the theory and the experiment gives support to the @xmath3 theory .",
    "however , note that it is possible that an abrikosov theory with sufficiently large non - local corrections may also account for the observed results .",
    "we acknowledge support from nsf dmr9527035 ( dfa ) , the swiss nationalfonds , the u.k . e.p.s.r.c . , and crest of japan science and technology corporation .",
