    "density functional theory , originally developed by hohenberg and kohn ( hk ) , @xcite replaces the main role of the wave function in the description of many electron systems and proves that the particle density @xmath1 determines all the properties of the system through the functional of the total energy @xmath2 $ ] . when @xmath3 $ ] is minimized , the density and the energy of the ground state can be found .",
    "the functional for the total energy of the interacting system is unknown , but kohn and sham ( ks)@xcite devised a method for the minimization of @xmath2 $ ] that uses the concept of noninteracting ks orbitals @xmath4 that yield the same density than the interacting system .",
    "the ks scheme allows to divide @xmath3 $ ] in four terms , and one of them is the kinetic energy density functional ( kedf ) of the ks noninteracting system , @xmath5 $ ] , that can be exactly evaluated in terms of the ks orbitals .    in order to provide insight into the physics of many - body systems ,",
    "we are interested in elucidating the formal properties of the kedf .",
    "as explained below , the thomas - fermi ( tf ) functional is a local density approximation that has been corrected with other terms that usually depend on the variations of the density , normally including second - order gradient terms ( see ref .   for a general review on the results obtained with a number of semilocal kinetic functionals ) . in this paper",
    "we will study the kinetic energy functional that includes the first - order gradient correction to the tf functional proposed by haq , chattaraj and deb.@xcite to assess the quality of this first - order gradient correction we will evaluate both the total kinetic energy and the local behavior of the approximate kinetic energy density ( ked ) .",
    "the study of the ked ( a function that depends on the spatial coordinates ) is made through a _",
    "quality factor _ @xmath6 , a parameter that reflects the quality of the functionals in a better way than their relative errors.@xcite it may be expected that the functional which systematically gives the better ked would probably also yield another properties more accurately .    in order to make the study of how this first - order gradient functional works for localized systems we test two simple systems : a noninteracting model ( fermions confined in a coulombic - type potential ) and an interacting electron system ( light atoms , from he to ar ) .",
    "as commented , the ks scheme allows to define the kedf of the ks noninteracting system , @xmath5 $ ] , for any many particle system .",
    "but , following the original hk idea , many attempts to write the kinetic energy as a functional , using exclusively the electron density , have been made .",
    "the very first attempt was a statistical method ",
    "the thomas - fermi ( tf ) functional , proposed by thomas@xcite and fermi@xcite  that has the form:@xmath7 = c_{tf}\\int { d\\mathbf{r}n(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3}\\mathbf { , } }   \\quad \\quad   c_{tf}=\\frac{3}{10}(3\\pi ^{2})^{2/3}.\\]]tf is exact for a free electron gas or an uniform system , but this local density approximation yields usually big relative errors around 10% for systems such as atoms and molecules .",
    "another well - known functional , due to von weizscker ( vw)1935weiz , is exact for any system described by a single orbital , @xmath8=\\frac{1}{8}\\int { d\\mathbf{r}\\frac{|\\mathbf{\\nabla } n(\\mathbf{r}% ) |^{2}}{n(\\mathbf{r})}}.\\ ] ]    the tf functional is usually corrected by functionals that depend on the variations of the density , as in the _ second - order gradient expansion approximation_)@xcite ( gea2 , where the vw term is weighted by @xmath9 ) @xmath10 =   c_{tf } \\int d\\mathbf{r } n(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3 }   + \\frac{1}{72 } \\int { d\\mathbf{r } \\frac{|\\mathbf{\\nabla } % n(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}}{n(\\mathbf{r})},}\\ ] ] that usually yields small relative errors usually lower than 1% when applied to localized systems using _ good _ densities ( i.  e. , those obtained with accurate methods as the hartree - fock or the ks ones ) , although it gives a wrong local behavior , misplacing the ked about @xmath11 . @xcite",
    "another functional that has obtained good results for these type of systems ( when atomic systems and homonuclear molecules are variationally solved)@xcite is the tf@xmath12vw one , @xmath13   & = &   t_{tf}\\left [ n\\right ] + \\frac{1}{5 } t_{vw}\\left [ n\\right ]   \\notag \\\\ & = &   c_{tf}\\int d\\mathbf{r~}n(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3 }   + \\frac{1}{40 } \\int { d\\mathbf{r } \\frac{|\\mathbf{\\nabla } n(\\mathbf{r})|^{2}}{n(\\mathbf{r})}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] but if we use these _ good _ electron densities , tf@xmath12vw usually yields bigger relative errors than gea2 and usually overestimates the total kinetic energy by more than @xmath14 .    beyond the gea2 and tf@xmath12vw , a number of other semilocal functionals within the _ generalized gradient approximation _",
    "( gga ) can be proposed using the general form @xmath15 = c_{tf}\\int { d\\mathbf{r~}n(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3}~f}\\left [ s\\left ( \\mathbf{r}\\right ) \\right].\\]]where @xmath16 $ ] is an _ enhancement factor _ that corrects the tf functional via the adimensional reduced gradient , @xmath17that takes into account the inhomogeneities of the system .",
    "the gga functionals include both the tf functional ( with @xmath16 = 1 $ ] )   and the gea2 and the tf@xmath12vw ones , as well as many other semilocal functionals .",
    "the gga functionals generally depend on @xmath18 , and their mathematical form and their results are cleary related to the gea2 ; only some of the ggas functionals yield smaller relative errors than the gea2 but none of them give better ked than the tf functional .",
    "@xcite    it is also important to know that , due to symmetry considerations in general systems , these functionals depend only on the absolute value of the gradient of the density ( or its squared value ) and never take into account the directionality of the density variations .      for localized systems",
    "a different functional has been proposed by haq , chattaraj and deb ( hdc)@xcite .",
    "this functional is an interesting exception , because it depends on the gradient of the electron density and not on its squared gradient , and also depends on the position vector @xmath19 ( differently to the other ggas ) .",
    "the form of the proposed functional is:@xmath20   & = &   c_{tf}\\int d\\mathbf{r~}n(\\mathbf{r})^{5/3 }   - \\frac{1}{40}\\int d\\mathbf{r }   \\frac{\\mathbf{r\\nabla } n(\\mathbf{r})}{r^{2 } }   \\notag \\\\ & = &   t_{tf}\\left [ n\\left ( \\mathbf{r}\\right ) \\right ]   + t_{r-1}\\left [ n\\left ( \\mathbf{r}\\right ) \\right ] , \\end{aligned}\\]]i .",

    "( see a general discussion on this topic in ref .",

    "we must note that the choice of @xmath23 as a prefactor has no theoretical justification and was chosen by trial and error .",
    "but it is possible to make a qualitative exercise to make a guess of the approximate value of this prefactor .",
    "we can argue using the previous inequality that the kinetic energy obtained with the vw functional should be close to the mean of the two bounds , i.e. @xmath37 .\\ ] ] on the other hand , it is well known that the tf functional can be quite accurately corrected by adding a weighted vw term ( e.g. the gea2 functional usually yields errors lower than 1% ) . and by replacing the vw functional by @xmath38 , we add to the tf functional a correction that is @xmath39 .",
    "this value @xmath40 is quite close to the proposed @xmath23 ( a difference of 17% , for a correction that represents about 8% of the total kinetic energy ) .",
