    "observation of the kondo effect in semiconducting quantum dots ( qds ) has opened a new area of research about the quantum transport through nanoscale and mesoscale systems.@xcite since qds have advantages to couple and then form qd molecules , the kondo effect in multi - qd systems exhibits various forms .",
    "for instance , the spin and orbital kondo effects , two - stage kondo effect , and kondo - fano effect have been observed , which induce abundant transport behaviors.@xcite in addition , the kondo effect plays a special role in affecting the andreev reflection in the systems with superconducting leads . in one josephson junction with an embedded qd ,",
    "the interplay between the kondo and josephson effects can efficiently drive the josephson phase transition.@xcite namely , if the kondo temperature @xmath1 is much greater than the superconducting gap @xmath2 , the kondo screening will dominate the system and the josephson current will be at its @xmath3 phase . instead , if @xmath4 , the ground state is a bcs - like singlet state , so the @xmath5-junction behavior occurs .",
    "in recent years , topological superconductor ( ts ) has become one main concern in the field of mesoscopic physics because majorana modes appear at the ends of the one - dimensional ts which are of potential application in topological quantum computation.@xcite owning to the presence of majorana zero mode , fractional josephson effect comes into being , manifested as the @xmath6-periodic oscillation and parity - related direction of the supercurrent . as a typical case , in the",
    "diii_-class ts , which is time reversal invariant , majorana mode appears in pairs due to kramers s theorem.@xcite hence at each end of the _ diii_-class ts nanowire there will exist one majorana doublet.@xcite since the majorana doublet is protected by the time - reversal symmetry , the period of its driving josephson current becomes related to the fermion parity of the _ diii_-class ts junction.@xcite what s more interesting is that in the junction formed by the coupling between the _ diii_-class ts and @xmath0-wave superconductor , josephson effect presents apparent time - reversal anomaly phenomenon.@xcite    in view of the special property of the _ diii_-class ts , we anticipate that in the its - existing josephson junction , the kondo effect can arouse new physics results .",
    "with such an idea , in this work we aim to investigate the new feature of the kondo effect in a hybrid josephson junction , i.e. , the junction formed by the indirect coupling between a _",
    "diii_-class ts and @xmath0-wave superconductor via one qd .",
    "our investigation shows that the single - electron occupation in the qd induces multiple correlation modes , including the kondo and singlet - triplet correlations between the qd and the @xmath0-wave superconductor and spin correlation between the qd and majorana doublet .",
    "besides , the kondo qd modifies the andreev reflection between the superconductors , leading to the occurrence of anisotropic and high - order kondo correlation and extra spin exchange correlations which contribute to the josephson effect .",
