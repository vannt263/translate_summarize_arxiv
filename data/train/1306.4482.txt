    "it was realized sometimes back by doplicher et.al @xcite from the consideration of both general relativity and quantum mechanics that the localization of an event in space - time with arbitrary accuracy is operationally impossible and this feature is captured by postulating a non vanishing commutation relation between the coordinates which are now promoted to the level of operators . in its simplest form",
    "they are given as @xmath3 = i\\theta_{\\mu\\nu }   \\label{noncom.rel}\\ ] ] where @xmath4 is taken to be an antisymmetric matrix and its entries are viewed as new fundamental constants @xcite .",
    "this form of non commutativity also follows from low energy limit of string theory @xcite .",
    "+ analysis of quantum field theory in the background of such non - commutative spaces is expected to provide insight into the structure of quantum gravity as @xmath0 is expected to be of the order of planck length scale . introducing such a length scale can have some serious consequences .",
    "for example , the structure of the commutation relation ( [ noncom.rel ] ) , with  @xmath4   held fixed ( i.e. not a tensor ) signals the violation of lorentz symmetry or simply the rotational @xmath2 symmetry in a non - relativistic system if the time t is taken to be the usual c - number parameter ( @xmath5 ) , rather than an operator . as has been shown in @xcite , this symmetry can be restored formally by deforming the co - product using the drinfeld twist .",
    "this in turn implies , according to the approach followed in @xcite , that the projection operator used to project multi - particle states into symmetric / antisymmetric subspaces to construct bosonic / fermionic states too should be deformed , thereby obtaining twisted bosons / fermions . in @xcite ,",
    "these twisted fermions were shown to violate pauli exclusion principle by computing thermal correlation function for a pair of twisted fermions , although it preserves the fermi dirac statistics @xcite .",
    "this computation , however , was carried out using moyal star product , which is essentially associated with certain basis ( called moyal basis in @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in the operatorial formulation of non - commutative quantum mechanics involving hilbert - schmidt operator , which was initiated in @xcite , one can bypass the use of any star product and hence can avoid the use of any associated bases and any ambiguities that may result there from @xcite .",
    "for example , in two - dimensional non - commutative moyal plane one can introduce two types of canonical star products : moyal and voros and one can identify the respective moyal and voros basis so that the representation , in any of these bases , of a composite state(obtained by a simple operator multiplication of a pair of states ) is the same as the one obtained by composing the respective representations of individual states by moyal / voros star products @xcite .",
    "however , it is only the voros basis which can be regarded as physical , as this conforms to povm ( positive operator valued measure ) , unlike the moyal basis . in particular",
    "the voros basis turns out to be a coherent state @xmath6 representing a maximally localized state in the non - commutative plane .",
    "indeed , it has been shown recently @xcite that one can compute the spectral distance , _ a la _",
    "connes @xcite between a pair of neighboring states @xmath7 and @xmath8 to get a euclidean geometry : @xmath9 but such a distance function can not be assigned between the pair of neighboring states @xmath10 and @xmath11 corresponding to the moyal basis .",
    "the primary reason is that the moyal basis does not conform to the requirement of povm , as we have mentioned above . besides , this moyal basis turns out to be the eigenstate of commuting position - like   observables : @xmath12 , which are defined as the average of left and right actions of the noncommutative position operators @xcite or equivalently obtained by a suitable linear transformation in the phase space as @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14=0 $ ] and therefore can not be interpreted as the position observables @xcite",
    "consequently , this moyal basis is a purely mathematical construct and is devoid of any physical meaning .",
    "these considerations therefore motivate us to have a re - look at this whole twisted formalism @xcite completely at the operatorial level , observe more closely the principle(s ) adopted here to enable us , to see whether this formalism where one constructs twisted bosons / fermions to accommodate deformed co - product , is an inevitable consequence of non - commutative space - time at least of the type given in ( [ noncom.rel ] ) .",
    "this is expected to shed light on other alternative formalisms existing in the literature ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the formalism adopted in @xcite was used to compute the thermal correlation function in @xcite . carrying out this analysis at the level of non - commutative quantum mechanics",
    "automatically paves the way for introducing second quantized non - relativistic field operators , which has a built - in tensor - product structure , where the left slot corresponds to particle creation / annihilation operator and the right slot is a momentum eigenstate . like the first quantized   quantum mechanical state ,",
    "one can also obtain moyal / voros space representations of this abstract second - quantized field operators by taking appropriate overlap with m / v basis . with this",
    ", the stage is set to carry out the computations of the thermal correlation function in the voros basis , where one can sensibly talk about the inter - particle distance .",
    "but , as has been discussed in @xcite , the voros wave functions @xmath15 of a state @xmath16 , besides belonging to schwartz class like its moyalian   counterpart , need to satisfy an additional smoothness criterion at small length scale @xmath17 ; oscillators with wavelengths @xmath18 are suppressed exponentially . since the thermal wavelength @xmath19 occurring in the expression of correlation function in @xcite , computed in the moyal basis which can be made smaller than @xmath18 for high enough temperature , one expects to find appropriate deformation in the corresponding result in voros basis .",
    "secondly , as we show below , the twisted basis in the momentum space in the multi - particle sector is equivalent to a basis , up to an overall phase , which is symmetric / anti - symmetric under the usual exchange operation ( i.e. not the deformed one ) enabling one to define the usual bosons / fermions ( and not their twisted counterparts ) , which nevertheless retains some deformations , stemming from non - commutativity .",
    "it will thus be interesting to study the structure of the thermal correlation function in these bases as well , which we henceforth refer to as quasi - commutative basis ,   for reasons that will become clear in the sequel .",
    "finally , we would like to extend our computation from the planar case to the more realistic and physical voros basis in odd three - dimensional space as well . indeed in three - dimensional space such a voros basis was introduced in @xcite satisfying the over completeness relation as in the two - dimensional case .",
    "it is therefore imperative to check whether this too satisfies the povm criterion and saturates the uncertainty relation both in 3d coordinate space and 6d phase space .",
    "related to this , is the structure of 3d non - commutative parameter @xmath20 .",
    "being singular , this matrix admits a vector @xmath21 dual to @xmath20 and pointing in a particular direction which behaves like a commutative axis in a rotated frame .",
    "it thus spoils the isotropicity i.e. @xmath2 symmetry of 3d space . despite restoring the @xmath2 symmetry through the deformed co - product at the level of commutator as in @xcite , it was shown in @xcite to violate @xmath2 symmetry at the level of the action in presence of interaction .",
    "it will therefore be quite interesting to look for any signature of the violation of this symmetry for a system containing a pair of free particles , itself .",
    "as a thermal effect the structure of the 3d correlation function or the resulting statistical potential should tell us immediately about this violation of @xmath2 symmetry .",
    "yet another place where this violation can also show up , is the structure of the variance matrix which occurs in the symplectic invariant formulation of the uncertainty relation , which we use here . since",
    ", however , the williamson s theorem @xcite and the associated technique for symplectic diagonalization @xcite is not known to hold in our context , we can make use of the transformation ( [ transfm . ] ) to obtain the corresponding commutative variance matrix and its symplectic spectrum and try to see whether the saturation condition holds for the entire variance matrix and also for each distinct modes   ( which are now de - coupled from each other ) in the same manner .",
    "finally , the resulting profile of the thermal effective potential may be used to study the nature of the violation of pauli exclusion principle , if any .",
    "this is expected to pave the way to study the astrophysical implications .",
    "the plan of the paper is given in the following manner : in section ii , we review the formulation of non - commutative quantum mechanics on two - dimension and three - dimension . in section iii",
    ", we provide a symplectic invariant formulation of the uncertainty relation . in section iv , we compute the non - commutative variance matrix for voros basis in three - dimension and find that voros basis states are maximally localized in phase space although it does not represent a maximally localized state in 3d non - commutative space .",
    "this single particle formulation of non - commutative quantum mechanics is extended in section v to two - particle system , where we try to formulate the twisted symmetric / anti - symmetric of @xcite through our operatorial approach . in section",
    "vi , the twisted formulation has been extended further for more than two particles and here we have introduced a quasi - commutative   momentum basis which is the usual symmetric / antisymmetric basis differing from the twisted basis by only a phase factor in the momentum space . with this , in section vii , we have discussed the second quantization through the second quantized creation / annihilation operator so as to establish a contact with non - relativistic quantum field theory . introducing the creation and annihilation operators in these two types of multi - particle momentum bases in section vii ,",
    "we have defined the abstract field operators in section viii and discuss its action on arbitrary state in position and momentum representations .",
    "then in section ix , we compute the two - particle correlation functions for a free gas in both two and three - dimensions and represent them in both moyal and voros bases using both twisted and quasi - commutative bases and obtain the corresponding effective potentials which is eventually plotted with respect to the inter - particle distance .",
    "finally , in section x , we conclude the paper .",
    "if @xmath38 and @xmath39 are the representations of the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively acting on @xmath33 , then a unitary representation is obtained by the following action : @xmath42\\ ] ] it is easily verified that the momentum eigenstates @xmath43 are given by @xmath44 and they satisfy the usual orthonormality condition and resolution of identity @xmath45 one can then introduce the voros basis @xcite @xmath46 and the moyal basis as @xmath47    as the voros basis can also be written as @xmath48 , in terms of the coherent states @xmath49 , this represents the maximally localized state .",
    "further , the representation of any composite state  @xmath50   in this voros / moyal basis automatically yields the voros / moyal star product composed expression of the corresponding representations of the individual states : @xmath51 with  @xmath52   and  @xmath53 , the voros basis was shown to conform to the requirement of povm , in contrast to the moyal basis @xcite as one can see that the resolution of identity for the voros basis @xmath54 has the integrand @xmath55 , which is a positive , but non - orthogonal unnormalized projection operator @xmath56    in @xmath57 , the algebra satisfied by the coordinate operators can be written as @xmath23 = i \\theta _ { ij } = i\\epsilon _ { ijk } \\theta _ k , ~~ i , j , k = 1,2,3\\ ] ] where @xmath58 is a @xmath59 anti symmetric matrix and @xmath60 is a vector dual to this .",
    "+ by formally transforming the coordinate system @xmath61 by a suitable so(3 ) rotation say @xmath62 , we can orient the vector @xmath63 in the fiducial frame along say the third axis . for example , if @xmath64 then the transformation  @xmath65  performed with @xmath66      then the action of the components of momenta in the original frame can be obtained through linearity as @xmath86   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we can verify that the simultaneous eigenstates of the above commuting momentum operators are given by @xmath87 note that @xmath88 is a scalar under an @xmath2 rotation .",
    "these momentum eigenstates will play an important role in the quantum hilbert space . in complete analogy with the 2-d case",
    ", these states too satisfy the orthonormality and the completeness relations @xmath89 here also , we can define the voros basis as @xmath90 which satisfies the completeness relation , if composed through voros star product : @xmath91 where @xmath92 with  @xmath93 ,   and have non - orthogonal overlap between any pair of such states : @xmath94 the corresponding overlap of this basis with momentum basis is @xmath95 next , we define the 3d moyal basis ( the counterpart of ( [ moyal]))as @xmath96 which also satisfies the completeness relation @xmath97 where @xmath98 the moyal basis is an orthonormal basis @xmath99 and its overlap with momentum basis is @xmath100 these moyal basis states are the simultaneous eigenstates of @xmath101 given by ( [ transfm . ] ) .    on the 3-d quantum hilbert space @xmath102 we can impose the additional structure of an algebra by defining the multiplication map @xcite : @xmath103 such that expanding a generic state @xmath16 in terms of momentum eigenstates and going to barred frame : @xmath104we can now prove the following composition rules ( 3d counterpart of eqn.([composed ] ) ) @xmath105where @xmath106 but here we loose any obvious connection of the voros basis to the coherent state .",

    "this symplectic spectrum is not to be confused with the ordinary spectrum , which is obtained by a similarity transformation .",

    "the state with this property is the one given by @xmath264 .",
    "as the action of the position operators are defined by left action , it is an eigenstate of @xmath265 and subsequently a minimum uncertainty state in classical configuration space .",
    "the right hand sector describes another property of the system .",
    "a more detailed discussion of this interpretation can be found in @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is also borne out by calculating the position representation of this state , e.g. , @xmath266 setting @xmath267 , this turns into @xmath268 clearly demonstrating that the state is localised at @xmath269 with non - local corrections deriving from an expansion in @xmath270 . restoring dimensions , @xmath270 is of the order @xmath0 , demonstrating that the non - local corrections are of the order of the length scale set by the non - commutative parameter . keeping in mind that @xmath271 is an operator on @xmath31 , and therefore an element of the algebra generated by the @xmath40 , it can be written in the form @xmath272 ( note that @xmath273 is a label and @xmath274 are operators ) .",
    "the two particle state must now also be an operator acting on the same configuration space @xmath31 and therefore be in the algebra generated by the @xmath40 , but it must also carry the indices of two particles .",

    "the similar actions of these new creation / annihilation operators are given by    @xmath363    @xmath364    and @xmath365 we can easily verify that these field operators obey the usual ( i.e. like @xmath107 ) ( anti ) commutation relations : @xmath366",
    "now we can look for the abstract field operators without referring to any basis .",
    "clearly , this is achieved by writing @xmath367 and @xmath368 here , we should note that the first slot of tensor product is an operator acting on a particular quantum hilbert space @xmath344 to give an element of @xmath369/@xmath370 corresponding to one less ( n-1)/one more ( n+1 ) number of particles , while the second slot of the tensor product is the momentum eigenstate belonging to quantum hilbert space @xmath33 , which incidentally is also an operator acting on classical hilbert space ( [ configuration ] ) .",

    "now we are interested to calculate the two - particle correlation function for a free gas in two and three dimensions using the canonical ensemble , i.e. to calculate the matrix elements @xmath384 , where @xmath385 is the canonical partition function and @xmath386 is the non - relativistic free particle hamiltonian with @xmath387 .",
    "this has been already calculated in @xcite in the twisted moyal basis . however , since moyal basis does nt conform to the povm unlike voros @xcite , our main interest will be to compute the resulting expression in voros basis .",
    "nevertheless we shall also present the corresponding computation in the moyal basis to demonstrate their structural similarity , except for deformed thermal wavelength in the voros case .",
    "thus the violation of the pauli principle seems to occur in either cases .",

    "further , the relative distance @xmath411 occurring in the either expression ( [ moyalian],[voros2 ] ) can only be regarded as the true distance only in the voros case , as the spectral distance _ a la _ connes could be computed in this case - unlike in the moyal case @xcite . and",
    "this difference stems from the fact that it is only the voros basis that conforms to povm - unlike the moyal basis @xcite .",
    "finally , we would like to say that this expression ( [ voros2 ] ) is different from the one obtained in @xcite which was calculated with the aspects of braided twisted symmetry , see ( @xcite , @xcite ) . as we had already mentioned that our approach is different from that of the braided twisted symmetry , it is quite obvious that we get different results .",
    "now let us consider the usual symmetric / antisymmetric two - particle state in the quasi - commutative basis given by @xmath412 computing in the similar way as done in the twisted case , we finally obtain the two - particle correlation functions in the quasi - commutative bases as      the above expressions show that the two - particle correlation function in the quasi - commutative moyal basis is just the same as the usual commutative result . however , in the quasi - commutative voros basis , although it turns out to be structurally same with the commutative or quasi - commutative moyal case , it picks up a non - commutative deformation through deformed mean thermal wavelength ( [ deformedlambda ] ) .",

    "<S> the issue of thermal correlation functions and the associated effective statistical potential in two - dimensional moyal space , arising in the twisted approach to implement rotational symmetry , has been revisited in an operatorial formulation where no explicit star product is used initially . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding results using moyal and voros star products are then easily obtained by taking the corresponding overlap with moyal and voros bases . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the moyal case where the concept of distance and , in particular , the relative separation between a pair of particles remain ambiguous when the moyal star product is used , the voros basis is more physical and the inter - particle distance can be introduced unambiguously . </S>",
    "<S> the forms of the correlation function and the effective potential are found to be same as the moyal case except that the thermal wavelength undergoes a non - commutative deformation , ensuring that it has a lower bound of the order of @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that in a suitable basis ( called here quasi - commutative basis ) in the multi - particle sector the thermal correlation function coincides with the commutative result both in the moyal and voros cases along with the restoration of the pauli principle , except that in the voros case the thermal wavelength , again , gets a non - commutative correction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we extend our result to three - dimensional non - commutative space and compute the correlation function and effective potential using both twisted and quasi - commutative bases in the moyal and voros cases . </S>",
    "<S> we find that there is @xmath1 symmetry breaking in the effective potential , which also violates the pauli principle , even for a pair of free particles , despite the fact that a deformed co - product is used to construct twisted symmetric / anti - symmetric basis . </S>",
    "<S> however , this @xmath2 symmetry , along with pauli principle , is restored once we use the quasi - commutative bases . </S>"
