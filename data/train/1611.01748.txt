    "the glass transition happens when a supercooled liquid falls out of equilibrium , i.e. , when the structural relaxation time is so long that the liquid can not equilibrate within a given experimental time .",
    "the temperature dependence of the relaxation time in the liquid just above the glass transition is in most cases super - arrhenius .",
    "liquids with a strongly super - arrhenius behaviour are traditionally referred to as `` fragile '' liquids following the convention of angell @xcite as opposed to `` strong '' liquids with a close to arrhenius behaviour .",
    "it is generally assumed that the relaxation dynamics are governed by energy barriers to be overcome by thermal activation , similar to an activation energy for a chemical reaction @xcite . in order to obtain super - arrhenius behaviour in this view , the activation energy , @xmath0 needs to be a decreasing function of the temperature , @xmath1 , and the relaxation time , @xmath2 is given by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a typical microscopic time and @xmath5 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "the fundamental question is then ; what causes the temperature dependence of the activation energy that almost always increases upon cooling with only a few exceptions , causing the super - arrhenius behaviour .    in the viscous liquid just above the glass transition",
    "there is a separation of time scales between the fast thermal vibrations taking place on the order of picoseconds , and the relaxation time which has a time scale of the order of hundreds of seconds .",
    "the separation of time scales has the consequence that the liquid will appear solid - like on time scales much shorter than the relaxation time , @xmath2 , and it will show liquid behaviour on time scales much longer than @xmath2 . in the energy landscape picture @xcite , this corresponds to a separation between fast vibrations around the energy minima on short time scales and the inherent dynamics on longer time scales , due to jumps between potential energy minima .",
    "there is no consensus on what governs the super - arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation time in liquids , though numerous models and theories have been developed in trying to encompass the phenomenon @xcite .",
    "the shoving model which is the focus of this paper belongs to a class of models referred to as elastic models @xcite .",
    "the starting point of elastic models is that a flow event , a molecular rearrangement , takes place on very short time scales by barrier transition .",
    "the transition itself is a fast process , but in the viscous liquid it is rare , which leads to slow relaxation .",
    "since the transition is fast , it is governed by properties of the liquid at short time scales where it appears as a solid .",
    "this gives a link between the vibrational , short - time elastic properties of the liquid and the relaxation on long time scales .",
    "as the liquid is cooled , the liquid hardens , the mechanical moduli increase and the vibrational amplitudes decrease .",
    "this leads to an increase in the barrier height which in turn leads to the super - arrhenius behaviour of the liquid s relaxation time .",
    "the details of the argument vary for the different versions of the elastic models .",
    "there is a series of more phenomenological results , which are not directly related to elastic models , but which support the notion that there is a connection between fast and slow dynamics .",
    "one of the first was the observation in 1992 by buchenau and zorn of a relation between fast and slow dynamics in selenium @xcite .",
    "they found a relation between the temperature dependence of the slow structural relaxation , the viscosity , and the fast mean - squared displacement ( msd ) studied with neutron time - of - flight .",
    "a connection between fast vibrational and slow structural dynamics was also suggested in several other works ( see , e.g. , the references of ref .  ) .",
    "some of these suggest a connection between the vibrational and elastic properties of the glass and the fragility of the corresponding liquid @xcite , others suggest a connection between the temperature dependence of the vibrations in the liquid and the temperature dependence of the structural relaxation time , the alpha relaxation , @xcite , closer to the original result from buchenau @xcite and the predictions of the shoving model discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : theory ] .    the shoving model and related elastic models",
    "have recently been discussed in the context of several theoretical developments . in 2013 yan , dring , and wyart discussed from a general point of view the connection between glass elasticity and fragility in a model that connects the two properties such that elasticity is a good predictor of fragility @xcite .",
    "mirigian and schweizer proposed a unified model for the viscosity of simple liquids going from the less - viscous regime of `` ordinary '' liquids to the highly viscous supercooled regime , in which the deviation from arrhenius temperature dependence in the high - viscosity regime is dominated by the elastic `` shoving '' work done on the surroundings to locally lower the density @xcite . in 2015",
    "schirmacher , ruocco , and mazzone proposed a unified theory for the viscosity , the low - temperature alpha relaxation and the high - frequency vibrational anomalies .",
    "the basic idea was to regard the system as a spatial mixture of different maxwell viscoelastic elements characterized by a distribution of activation energies , each proportional to the local high - frequency shear modulus @xcite .",
    "also in 2015 betancourt , hanakata , starr , and douglas connected the short - time vibrational msd to free volume and cooperativity , arguing that several apparently different models for the viscous slowing down are , in fact , different aspects of the same mechanism @xcite .",
    "the shoving model and related elastic models have also been used recently for interpreting experimental findings , e.g. , in ref .   .",
    "the shoving model exists in two different formulations , one which connects the relaxation time to the high - frequency shear modulus , @xmath6 , and one which relates the relaxation time to short - time msd .",
    "the two versions of the model are equivalent under a few simple approximations",
    ". one of these assumptions is somewhat implicit , namely that the two properties are measured at the same time scale  or that they are measured in a range where there is no time scale dependence of the properties .",
    "however , as the alpha relaxation time becomes longer , i.e. , beyond the millisecond range , many liquids exhibit one or more beta relaxation processes at shorter time scales than the alpha relaxation time",
    ". the beta relaxation can have a quite large amplitude in the shear modulus @xcite and the elastic properties and the temperature dependencies of these will therefore be different when probed at different time scales .",
    "many of the tests of the @xmath6 version of the shoving model are made based on measurements made on the khz range , whereas the msd version has been tested primarily based on neutron scattering data performed on the pico- or nanosecond time scale .",
    "the issue of which time scale to use in elastic models has been discussed previously @xcite . since the thermal motion that gives rise to the transition is dominated by phonons , it is argued that the relevant time scale should be the picosecond time scale .",
    "however , for some liquids elastic models appear to work better when tested at longer time scales where the properties are more temperature dependent than at the phonon - times @xcite .",
    "in other words , the temperature dependence of the vibration on the phonon time scale is not always large enough to account for the super - arrhenius temperature dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "based on these types of observations , buchenau @xcite argues that the elastic models need to be combined with an adam - gibbs model , and that both the hardening of the liquid and the decrease of entropy are to be included to properly explain the temperature dependence of the relaxation time .",
    "however , there is also a paper where the @xmath6 version of the model is supported by @xmath6 data determined from a range of techniques using different time scales in order to establish the plateau value correctly @xcite .",
    "in a recent review on experimental tests @xcite of both versions of the shoving model , it was found that the shoving model works in many cases , but in other cases not , yet there is no apparent system in when it works and when it does not work .    in this paper",
    "we present an experimental test of the main approximation connecting the @xmath6 and the msd version of the shoving model .",
    "this is done by measuring @xmath6 at the khz range and the msd at the nanosecond range .",
    "moreover , we directly compare the performance of the two versions of the shoving model . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "this is the first time the connection between @xmath6 and the msd is directly established experimentally , as well as being the first paper to include data to test different versions of the shoving model on the same systems .",
    "because there seems to be no general trend for when and for which systems elastic models hold @xcite , we will in this paper turn to liquids showing as simple behaviour as possible .",
    "both liquids have been found to obey density scaling , which means that the relaxation time is a unique function of @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is density , @xmath1 is temperature and @xmath9 is a material constant @xcite .",
    "moreover , they obey time - temperature superposition ( tts ) , which means that the spectral shape is independent of temperature and time @xcite .",
    "shear mechanical and dielectric spectroscopy measured on cumene ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : msd_shear_cumene ] of this paper and ref .  ) show a very low amplitude beta relaxation ( in the range of percent of the alpha relaxation ) whereas 5ppe only exhibits a weak wing @xcite .",
    "the absence of a prominent beta relaxation should assure that the elastic shear modulus does not change appreciably in the time scale from milliseconds to seconds .",

    "in the original @xmath6 version of the shoving model @xcite , a local expansion is assumed to take place in order for a flow event to happen .",
    "the activation energy is identified as the work done _ shoving _ aside the surrounding liquid during this local expansion , and the activation energy is associated with the elastic energy located in the surroundings of the flow event . according to the shoving model , because the flow event itself is fast ,",
    "the surrounding liquid will behave like a solid during the expansion . assuming the local region that expands is spherical , the relevant elastic constant of the surroundings is the elastic shear modulus , @xmath6 .",
