    "in the last few years  band offset engineering \" ( _ i.e. _ the possibility of tuning the electronic and transport properties of semiconductor heterojunctions through modifications of their valence band offset ( vbo ) induced by strain , growth process , number of layers etc . )",
    "has attracted great attention for both scientific and technological reasons @xcite . only recently , however , have lattice mismatched heterostructures begun to realize their potential , due to new developments in preparation techniques which finally allowed pseudomorphic crystal growth without misfit dislocations @xcite . in a parallel way ,",
    "some theoretical works @xcite focused on strained heterojunctions , but still much effort is needed to understand what mainly affects the band line - up at the interface .    in this work , we consider homopolar isovalent heterostructures .",
    "in particular , we examine iii - v superlattices ( sls ) , namely the common - anion system gasb / insb ( lattice mismatch of 5.7 @xmath0 ) and the common - cation system inas / insb ( lattice mismatch of 6.4 @xmath0 ) , concentrating on the effect of ordering direction and strain conditions determined by sl pseudomorphic growth on a given substrate . _",
    "ab - initio _ self - consistent full potential linearized augmented plane wave flapw @xcite local density calculations were performed for ( gasb)@xmath1/(insb)@xmath1 and ( inas)@xmath1/(insb)@xmath1 sls , grown along the [ 001 ] ( tetragonal symmetry ) and [ 111 ] ( trigonal symmetry ) directions , in which the interface was represented by three alternating layers of each binary constituent ( 12 atoms in each unit cell ) . in what follows ,",
    "it is important to keep in mind that if strain is not taken into account , the valence bands in unstrained gasb and insb are predicted to line - up ( therefore giving zero vbo ) , whereas the unstrained insb topmost valence band is expected to be 0.51 ev _ higher _ in energy than that in unstrained inas ( see ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "as pointed out by mailhot and smith @xcite , [ 111 ] ordered strained - layer sls show large polarization fields oriented along the growth direction , which lead to a shift in the electronic energy levels .",
    "however , this effect is negligible for ultrathin sls , such as those examined in the present work .",
    "moreover , the effect completely vanishes for [ 001 ] ordered sls , due to the symmetry properties of the strain tensor .",
    "finally , we neglect interdiffusion processes which lead to interfacial composition changes ( i.e. we consider an atomically abrupt geometry ) and relaxations at the interface of the anion - cation distance ( bulk bond length away from the interface are considered equal to those immediately next to it ) : this , in fact , is expected @xcite to introduce little modification of the charge rearrangement at the junction and hence of the vbo .",
    "most of the computational parameters are common to those used previously for [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] ordered ( 1x1 ) sls @xcite , except for the wave function cut - off ( @xmath2 = 2.7 a.u.).[17 ] tests performed by increasing the @xmath2 up to 3.1 showed a change in the vbo of less than 0.01 ev .",
    "there is , however , an important difference with respect to the calculations performed for ultrathin ( @xmath3 = 1 ) sls regarding the cation @xmath4-shell : in the present work , the ga 3@xmath4 and in 4@xmath4 electrons are treated as part of the core and not as valence electrons ( previous works @xcite demonstrated a slight dependence ( about 0.03 ev ) of the vbo in common - cation systems on the @xmath4-shell treatment ) - which results in a strong reduction of the computational effort .",
    "furthermore , the core charge spilling out of the ga and in muffin tin spheres was treated using an exact overlapping charge method , thus minimizing the error introduced by the treatment of semicore states .",
    "the structural parameters ( reported elsewhere @xcite ) are determined according to the macroscopic theory of elasticity ( mte ) , whose validity in predicting the correct structure for the determination of the vbo is established @xcite .",
    "our choice is also justified by the results obtained in the case of ultrathin sls @xcite , which were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from total energy minimization .    in order to study the dependence of the vbo on the strain",
    ", we examined different strain conditions for ( ac)@xmath1/(bc)@xmath1-type [ 001 ] ordered sls ( the common cation case ( ab)@xmath1/(ac)@xmath1 is treated in an analogous way ) : ( i ) pseudomorphic growth of a bc epilayer on an ac substrate ; ( ii )  free standing mode \" , equivalent to a system grown on an a@xmath5b@xmath5c substrate ( denoted in the following as  av . subs . \" ) ; and ( iii ) pseudomorphic growth of an ac epilayer on a bc substrate .    on the other hand",
    ", the dependence of the vbo on the ordering direction is studied through a comparison of the [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] ordered sls grown on a fixed substrate with average lattice constant , but different crystallographic orientations .",
    "this choice of the substrate and the consequent lattice relaxation , leads to a small difference ( about 1.4 @xmath0 ) between the lattice constants of the binary constituents along the [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] growth direction .",
    "in analogy with the common experimental approach followed in photoemission measurements , we have evaluated the vbo using core electron binding energies as reference levels @xcite .",
    "we have chosen the @xmath6-levels of the common atom c ( _ i.e. _ sb in the common - anion system and in in the common - cation system ) .",
    "note that other choices of core levels for different atoms ( _ i.e. _ ga and in in the common - anion system , as and sb in the common - cation system ) would produce a vbo value differing from those reported here by at most 0.06 ev , which has thus to be considered as our numerical uncertainty .",
    "the calculation of the vbo , @xmath7 , is done according to the following expression : @xmath8 where the interface term @xmath9 indicates the relative core level alignment of the two c atoms at opposite sides of the interface ( one belonging to the ac side and the other to the bc side ) , while @xmath10 indicates the binding energy difference ( relative to the valence band maximum ( vbm ) ) of the same core levels evaluated in the binary constituents , opportunely strained to reproduce the elastic conditions of the sl .",
    "first of all , we focus our attention on the elastically relaxed  av . subs . \"",
    "[ 001 ] and [ 111 ] ordered sls .",
    "we should now notice that there are two inequivalent interfaces along the [ 111 ] growth axis @xcite ; for example , in the common - anion sl , we can have the ordering direction parallel either to the insb interface bond or to the gasb interface bond .",
    "our results indicate that the @xmath9 term is essentially the same ( within 0.02 ev ) in the two different situations , suggesting that the effect due to the particular geometry at the interface is very small .",
    "table [ vbo1 ] lists the contributions due to the interface ( @xmath9 ) and to the strained bulks ( @xmath10 ) and the resulting values of the vbos ( @xmath7 ) as a function of the ordering direction ; the superscripts @xmath11 and @xmath12 indicate respectively the non - relativistic and relativistic ( _ i.e. _ spin - orbit coupling treated in a perturbative approach ) calculations .",
    "we note that the interface term has a positive sign , indicating that the sb - core levels are deeper at the gasb ( inas ) side of the common - anion ( common - cation ) interface , compared to the corresponding levels at the insb side .",
    "further , the first contribution ( @xmath13 is seen to be sensitive to the crystallographic ordering ( the two values for [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] growth axis differ by 0.1 ev both in the common - anion and the common - cation systems ) , while the second contribution to the vbo ( @xmath10 ) is almost uninfluenced by the ordering direction . on the whole , we do not observe a marked dependence of the vbo on the crystallographic ordering at the interface . since it is well - known for lattice matched structures @xcite that the band line - up is independent of interface orientation , the vbo change we find in going from the [ 001 ] to the [ 111 ] ordered sls has to be related only to the appreciable mismatch which causes a different relaxation of the interface bond - lengths .",
    "let us now look at the role of the mismatch in determining the band line - up .",
    "our results for [ 001 ] systems with different pseudomorphic growth conditions are shown in table [ vbo2 ] , where the notation is analogous to that of table [ vbo1 ] .",
    "note that the interface term @xmath9 is very similar in the same sl grown on the three different substrates , implying that the charge readjustment at the interface is almost independent of the strain conditions .",
    "this is confirmed by the results obtained with a small change ( by as much as 0.6 @xmath0 ) of the bond length at the interface : the calculated @xmath9 is consistent with the one obtained for mte structures within 0.03 ev .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath10 term ( _ i.e. _ the bulk contribution to the vbo ) varies dramatically , showing that the core level binding energies in the strained binary suffers an appreciable change when growing the sl on different substrates .",
    "in fact , the energy of the topmost valence level ( and hence the binding energy @xmath14 ) is determined by the interplay of the spin - orbit coupling and the non - cubic  crystal field \" @xcite .",
    "in particular , the second of these two effects is critically dependent on strain conditions , and is thus the origin of the large difference between the @xmath15 in table [ vbo2 ] .",
    "furthermore , what is remarkable about table [ vbo2 ] is the clear trend shown by the vbo as a function of the substrate lattice constant : the smaller the @xmath16 , the more the insb topmost valence level is raised with respect to the vbm of the other sl constituent .    in order to understand more fully the action of the strain on the vbo",
    ", we have also estimated the band line - up with respect to unstrained binaries for the [ 001 ] interfaces .",
    "thus , we substituted in eq.([equazione ] ) the @xmath9 value obtained for [ 001 ] interfaces ( which was found to be almost independent of strain effects ) and the @xmath10 , evaluated starting from the zincblende bulk unstrained constituents ( i.e. disregarding the effect of strain on the binary s vbm ) .",
    "taking into account the spin - orbit coupling , we obtain @xmath17 = 0.03 ev and @xmath17 = 0.49 ev for the gasb / insb and inas / insb heterojunctions , respectively .",
    "these results match perfectly those reported in ref .",
    "@xcite and the above mentioned valence bands perfect alignment for the common anion system and @xmath17 = 0.51 ev for the common cation case , showing that , if strain is not correctly taken into account , completely different results are found .",
    "it is important to notice that the strain acting on the energy of the topmost valence band level is also responsible for the spatial localization of this state .",
    "we find , in fact , that in all of the common anion ( common cation ) structures , the hole carriers are mainly localized on the insb side of the heterojunction , while in the gasb / insb system grown on an insb substrate we find a complementary situation .",
    "this is clear from the decreasing trend of the vbo as the lattice constant is increased and from the sign change in the insb substrate case ( showing that the vmb in gasb is higher in energy than in insb ) .",
    "figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , for common - anion and common - cation interfaces respectively , illustrate the linear dependence ( see the solid line in the figures ) of the vbo on the lattice parameter which determines the sl pseudomorphic growth . thus , the two figures show that the gasb / insb and inas / insb sls provide a good opportunity for tuning their vbo : a range of about 0.5 ev for common - anion and of 0.7 ev for common - cation systems is covered by varying the strain conditions determined by the substrate .",
    "let us now compare our results with other theoretical predictions , obtained from model @xcite , semi - empirical @xcite and _ ab - initio _ @xcite calculations , as illustrated in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .",
    "note that all the predicted values agree with those of the present work ( except those of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , within their uncertainty of a few hundredths of an ev @xcite and our error bars , respectively .",
    "incidentally , we observe that a similar disagreement between _ ab initio _ results and those obtained by cardona and christensen @xcite was also found in other iii - v isovalent heterojunctions , such as gap / inp @xcite and gaas / inas @xcite . furthermore , the linear trend of the band offset as a function of the strain found in the present work is in excellent agreement with the predictions of other theoretical work @xcite and is reasonably expected to reproduce the real situation .",
    "so far , we have completely omitted a discussion of the conduction band offset ( @xmath18 ) , due to well known failures of lda in predicting the correct band gap energies .",
    "however , we should now point out that , using an approximate estimate of empirical band gaps ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) , we can obtain information on the different kinds of band line - ups as growth conditions are changed .",
    "in fact , we find a type i alignment for all the [ 001 ] common anion interfaces , while [ 111 ] gasb / insb shows a type ii staggered alignment ( partial overlap of the band gaps ) . on the other hand , for [ 001 ] common",
    "cation grown both on an inas and on an average substrate , we find a type ii broken gap line - up , with the inas conduction band minimum lower in energy than the insb vbm . finally , the [ 001 ] inas / insb grown on insb and",
    "the [ 111 ] inas / insb heterojunctions contain a semimetallic compound ( inas ) , thus leading to a type iii alignment .",
    "starting from the results obtained from _ ab initio _",
    "calculations @xcite for different [ 001 ] oriented strained layer interfaces ( with similar lattice mismatch and grown on a substrate having lattice constant averaged over those of the constituents ) , it is interesting to discuss the vbo trend as a function of the atomic species involved .",
    "we compare the value obtained for the common anion gasb / insb ( lattice mismatch of 5.7 @xmath0 and @xmath7 = 0.07 ev , in good agreement with @xmath7 = 0.04 ev reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) , with those obtained for gap / inp @xcite ( lattice mismatch of 7.4 @xmath0 and @xmath7 = 0.01 ev ) and for gaas / inas @xcite ( lattice mismatch of 5.7 @xmath0 and @xmath7 = 0.00 ev ) . taking into account that these results are obtained by different computational methods and are therefore affected by different error bars , it appears that , under similar strain conditions , the vbo is almost uninfluenced by the change of both anions in the common anion systems",
    ". therefore , since the @xmath9 term is expected to be constant ( due to similar ionicity difference of the constituents ) , these results seem to suggest that also the @xmath10 term has to be similar in all the gax / inx ( x = p , as , sb ) structures",
    ". a similar @xmath7 is also found , if we compare our results for inas / insb ( lattice mismatch of 6.4 @xmath0 and @xmath7 = 0.54 ev ) with gaas / gasb ( lattice mismatch of 7.2 @xmath0 ) , where both cations are changed ( @xmath7 = 0.65 @xmath19 0.1 ev @xcite ) .",
    "this observation can be explained , considering the anionic character ( see ref .",
    "@xcite , ref . @xcite and references therein ) of the topmost valence level in the binary constituents , which determines the binding energy contribution ( @xmath10 ) to the valence band offset : for example , provided that the state of strain is similar in the constituent materials grown on an average substrate , we do nt expect a strong difference in the band line - up if we change the cation at both sides of the common cation interface .    from the experimental point of view , the high mismatch ( about 6 @xmath0 ) between the lattice constants of the two sl constituents results in great difficulty to grow the sl systems , without misfits and dislocations .",
    "only recently , an insb quantum - well has been realized in gasb @xcite ; starting from photoluminescence peak emission energy data and from calculations based on a standard finite square - well model @xcite ( taking into account strain @xcite ) , a vbo of 0.16 ev was obtained that is quite different from the one , 0.34 ev , reported in table [ vbo2 ] .",
    "unfortunately , a similar disagreement between theoretical and experimental data , obtained using different techniques , was found also for other homopolar isovalent iii - v interfaces , such as the gaas / inas ( see ref . @xcite and references therein ) and gap / inp ( @xmath7 = 0.01 ev , the theoretical result @xcite against @xmath7 = 0.60 ev , the experimental results from photoluminescence @xcite ) systems , that are reasonably close to the common - anion one studied here .",
    "in particular , in a recent work focused on gaas / inas sls , ohler _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained ( from ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements of the cation @xmath4-core levels ) a @xmath7 value in disagreement ( by as much as 0.3 ev ) with theoretical predictions @xcite .",
    "notwithstanding some differences between the experimental and theoretical vbo values , many important observations discussed above are confirmed by ohler _",
    "et al . _ experimental work @xcite .",
    "for example , the linear trend found @xcite for @xmath20 ( in gaas / inas sls ) as a function of @xmath16 agrees with theoretical predictions @xcite and with our results ; further , the independence of the @xmath21 term on the strain conditions discussed above , is experimentally confirmed @xcite by the trend of the in 4@xmath22 and ga 3@xmath23 core - level binding energy difference , which is almost unaffected by the different substrate used in growing the heterostructure .    as a last comment",
    ", we think that it worthwhile to remark that the linear trend found in ref .",
    "@xcite for the gaas / inas vbo s as a function of the growth conditions leads to a slope that is almost equal to that of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] for gasb / insb systems .",
    "starting from the band offset transitivity rule - which is well established ( to within 0.02 ev ) @xcite for [ 001 ] common - atom superlattices - we can derive the vbo for the inas / gasb system , an almost lattice matched interface ( the two lattice constants differ only by 0.6 @xmath0 ) .",
    "this system is attracting more and more attention recently for its unusual type ii broken - gap band line - up . through a linear interpolation of the common - anion band offsets as a function of the substrate lattice constant ,",
    "we have calculated the vbo for the gasb / insb system as if grown on an inas substrate . as evidenced above ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , the linear approximation is expected to be reasonably valid ; furthermore , in this case the extrapolation is obtained for a lattice constant ( @xmath24 ) which differs by only 0.7 @xmath0 from one of our self - consistent results ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "we thus report in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] our calculated vbo for the common - cation sl on an inas substrate and the extrapolated value for the ideal common - anion sl grown on an inas substrate . using the transitivity rule ,",
    "we obtain :    @xmath26    so that @xmath27 = 0.88 - 0.40 = 0.48 ev .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the available experimental values ( 0.46 ev @xcite , 0.51 ev @xcite ) .",
    "in summary , we have studied the valence band offsets in [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] gasb / insb and inas / insb interfaces by means of _ ab - initio _ flapw calculations , focusing our attention on its dependence on ordering direction and strain conditions .",
    "our results indicate that , under the same strain conditions , the former has quite a small effect on the band line - up mainly due to the different structural relaxation of the interface atoms at the [ 001 ] and [ 111 ] heterojunctions . on the other hand ,",
    "a much more important effect is due to pseudomorphic growth on different substrates : the high tunability of the vbo ( about 0.5 ev and 0.7 ev for common - anion and for common - cation sls , respectively ) is evidenced by its linear decreasing trend as the substrate lattice constant is increased , mainly due to the bulk contribution to the band line - up .",
    "finally , the transitivity rule was used to determine the inas / gasb valence band offset and good agreement between theory and experiment was obtained .",
