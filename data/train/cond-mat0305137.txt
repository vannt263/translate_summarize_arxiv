    "living polymerization has a substantial number of industrial applications in the production of soaps , dyes , organometallic complexes , _ _",
    "etc.__@xcite moreover , some biological objects owe their functionality to reversible processes of assembly and disassembly .",
    "particular examples are microtubules , actin and intermediate filaments composing the cytoskeleton of living cells.@xcite they are involved in several vital processes such as transport , chromosomal segregation,@xcite growth and division of a cell . in contrast to common synthetic living polymers , biological self - assembled objects have a considerable molecular masses , sufficient to induce a significant concentration gradient in an aqueous suspension of these objects . in turn",
    ", the concentration gradient can influence the equilibrium size of the objects and for long rigid aggregates it can even provoke the isotropic ",
    "nematic phase transition .",
    "before we address such phenomena it is useful to get an estimate of the relevance of the effect of gravity for a real system .",
    "let us focus on a particular example of microtubules .",
    "the typical length of a microtubule is @xmath0 @xmath1m,@xcite the linear density is @xmath2 ( g / mol)/nm , so the total mass of a microtubule is @xmath3 g / mol .",
    "the molecular mass of a tubulin dimer , subunit of a microtubule , is @xmath4 g / mol,@xcite thus , one microtubule comprises of @xmath5 tubulins .",
    "the influence of the gravity is significant if the potential energy of the object in the gravitational field is of order or higher the thermal energy , @xmath6 , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the mass of a subunit corrected for buoyancy ( @xmath9 g/@xmath10 is the density of water , @xmath11 nm@xmath12 is the subunit volume , so the effective mass in a solution is @xmath13 g / mol ) .",
    "thus , the gravity is important when @xmath14 . assuming the total height of the vessel , @xmath15 cm , the gravitational acceleration , @xmath16 m / s@xmath17 , the temperature , @xmath18 k , we get @xmath19 .",
    "so , even the earth gravitational field can influence the equilibrium properties of such heavy objects as microtubules .",
    "note , that one can reach @xmath20 times larger gravitational acceleration in an ultracentrifuge , @xcite which sometimes is used in the process of preparation of microtubules,@xcite or in the pelleting experiments .",
    "@xcite to this end , the gravitational field can serve as a driving force for the assembly and , eventually , to the nematic ordering of growing aggregates .",
    "another way to study the equilibrium distribution of linear aggregates is the rotating clinostat experiments@xcite which constitute the rotation of a tube about the horizontal axis . changing the direction of",
    "the `` fall '' all the time can effectively reduce the gravity .",
    "such apparatus gives the gravitational fields in the range @xmath21 g.    the rotating clinostat experiments@xcite were used to examine the microtubule self - organization and structuration by reaction - diffusion mechanisms leading to different pattern formation .",
    "it was shown , that microtubules self - organize in different patterns in the normal gravitational field , while no self - organization occurs in the absence of the gravity.@xcite    it is noteworthy , that the gravity can also bring about the opposite process , namely the floating to the surface when @xmath22 .",
    "one of the most known processes of that type is the creaming of emulsions . in our consideration",
    "this only changes the sign of the effective mass , @xmath23 , while the top and the bottom switch their places .    the problem of the influence of weak gravitational fields on different vital processes is largely investigated in the framework of so - called microgravity research performed in sounding rockets , parabolic flights or a space station . in particular , it concerns a number of experiments conducted on board of space - shuttle flights .",
    "for example , the formation of liposomes is altered by the gravitational field:@xcite the size of the liposomes formed in the absence of the gravity is considerably larger than that formed in the normal earth conditions .",
    "the gravity also influence the long - range ordering of some systems:@xcite space - grown crystals have better optical quality , smoothness of crystal faces , _",
    "etc_. the problem of crystal growth under gravity is also discussed in ref . .    however , the number of theoretical treatment of these observations is not so impressive . here",
    "are some examples : the size distribution with height of noninteracting linear micelles in the gravitational field has been analyzed in ref . .",
    "it was shown , that the concentration gradient due to gravitational or centrifugal field leads to the hyperbolic dependence of the average aggregation number with height in contrast to simple barometric dependence for nonaggregating objects .",
    "the dynamics of linear micelles in the ultracentrifuge is studied in ref . .",
    "the sedimentation of colloidal rods in an ultracentrifuge , has been studied theoretically in ref . .",
    "in our previous paper@xcite we studied the isotropic to nematic phase transition of rigid monodisperse rods with _",
    "fixed size _ in the gravitational field .",
    "the major result is that the gravity can induce the nematic ordering in the system of rigid rods , while the main effect of the gravity on the phase diagram is the broadening of the phase coexistence region .",
    "it was also shown that interactions between rigid rods can lead to deviations from the barometric distribution of rods with height .    in the present paper",
    "we analyze a wider range of systems . instead of fixed length of rods,@xcite",
    "we assume that the size of rods determines by the equilibrium conditions .",
    "in particular , this is the case of ( i ) living polymers , which can attach monomers to the end of the chain , ( ii ) linear surfactant micelles , ( iii ) biological self - assembled objects such as microtubules and actin filaments .",
    "although all these systems have different geometries and different size scales , they have additional degree of freedom , namely the annealed length of the aggregates which can be tuned by external conditions .",
    "thus , we expect , that the gravitational field can have a severe influence on the equilibrium size and the concentration profile of the aggregates .",
    "the new result of this paper is that the gravity induces the overall growth of the aggregates .",
    "concerning the isotropic to nematic phase transition of stiff aggregates with annealed size , we expect the same effect of the gravity as in the case of rods with fixed length .",
    "namely , the gravity can induce the nematic ordering and broaden the coexistence region .",
    "however , annealed length implies a large polydispersity of the aggregates , thus , we investigate the influence of the gravity on the distribution of lengths in a solution . since the phase separation is coupled with the redistribution of aggregates of different lengths with different heights , we discuss the structure of the two coexisting phases and the distribution of the average aggregation number with height .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the general definitions and the expressions for the free energy and the distribution function",
    "are given .",
    "in the section iii we consider the equilibrium properties of the homogeneous isotropic solution of living polymers under gravity .",
    "the concentration profiles and the average aggregation numbers as a functions of height are analyzed . in the section iv",
    ", we examine the isotropic to nematic phase transition in the gravitational field .",
    "we discuss the effect of the broadness of the phase separation region in the gravitational field for living polymers , the length distribution functions of the aggregates in the coexisting region and polydispersity of the phases . in the conclusion",
    "we summarize the obtained results .",
    "living polymers are linear aggregates which can bind reversibly one subunit to the end of the chain .",
    "they show a broad distribution of lengths , since their energy depends only on end effects and there are no packing constrains preventing the infinite growth as in the case of spherical micelles .",
    "the scission end energy ( in units of @xmath6 ) , @xmath24 ensures energetically favorable formation of aggregates .",
    "the aggregation energy per subunit , @xmath25 has a simple form:@xcite @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the bulk energy , which is independent on @xmath28 .",
    "thus , @xmath29 is the energy of an aggregate with the aggregation number @xmath28 .",
    "the subunit concentration is assumed to be much larger than _ cmc _ , so the aggregates are rather long .",
    "our description is based on the theories of living polymers and the liquid crystalline transition in the absence of the field.odijkrev,taylor,gelbart1 , gelbart2,mcmullen , cuesta , schootmain , schootgrowth , schootphase , schootisotropic , schootnem for our description we take as a starting point ref . .",
    "it is known , that the assumption of perfectly rigid aggregates leads to unphysically strong coupling of growth and nematic ordering.@xcite    that is why , we have to allow for the partial flexibility of the aggregates .",
    "we do it in accordance to refs.@xcite , where the flexibility of the chains is coming through a particular form of the trial function in the nematic phase .",
    "however , in this approach the flexibility of the isotropic phase is not taken into account .",
    "we consider the solution of living polymers in the vessel subject to the gravitational field .",
    "suppose , that the gravitational field acts in the @xmath30 direction , such that the subunit concentration varies from its maximal value at @xmath31 ( bottom ) to its minimal value at @xmath32 ( top ) .",
    "our discussion is focused on the case of long aggregates .",
    "we ignore the end effects , though they can be important for short chains@xcite that dominate at the top of the vessel , but for the subunit concentration well above the _ cmc _ , the fraction of short aggregates in a solution is low .    in the following",
    "we will see , that the gravity can lead to the nematic ordering in the described system , thus , we write the free energy in a general form which assumes the orientational order .",
    "the free energy can be written in terms of the dimensionless concentration of rods each comprised of @xmath28 subunits oriented in the spatial angle @xmath33 on the height @xmath30 as @xmath34 ( this is the number concentration multiplied by the volume of a single subunit , @xmath35 ) .",
    "@xmath34 obeys the following constraint    @xmath36    where @xmath37 is the total volume fraction of subunits on the height @xmath30 .",
    "the total subunit concentration is @xmath38 .",
    "the free energy is composed of an ideal and an interaction terms , @xmath39 .",
    "the ideal term per unit volume is written in the form    @xmath40 dnd\\omega + \\int c(n,\\omega , z)\\beta nzdnd\\omega   \\label{fid}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the first term is the well known expression for the free energy of self - assembled aggregates.@xcite the factor @xmath41 is introduced for convenience of description of the isotropic phase , though it can be absorbed in the energy of an aggregate , @xmath29 .",
    "the last term is the potential energy in units @xmath6 of aggregates in the gravitational field .",
    "the only parameter associated with the field is @xmath42 , which depends on the total height of the vessel .",
    "note , that although the last term in ( [ fid ] ) coincide with that in the case of monodisperse rods of fixed length,@xcite the definitions of this parameter does not coincide .",
    "here @xmath23 is the mass of a single subunit , while in ref .",
    "@xmath23 is the total mass of a rod .",
    "again , we assume that the characteristic length of the variation of the field is much bigger than the length of a rod , although the fields in the ultracentrifuge can be very high and this assumption can be violated .    in order to apply the onsager approximation,@xcite",
    "we assume excluded volume interactions only . moreover , only pair interactions are taken into account , higher order interaction terms are neglected .",
    "this is a strong approximation which is strictly speaking not valid for high concentrations in the nematic phase .",
    "as we will see , the strong gravitational field induces the precipitation of extremely long , and thus , heavy , aggregates and the second virial approximation should be corrected .",
    "nevertheless , this approximation works well in the isotropic phase and it also gives reasonable qualitative estimates in the nematic phase .",
    "the interaction term per unit volume for athermal aggregates , written in the second virial approximation has the following formschootmain , schootisotropic    @xmath43    where @xmath44 is the second virial coefficient which depends on the angle @xmath45 between two rods . neglecting the end effects",
    ", it can be written in the form@xcite @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the lengths of two cylinders , @xmath49 is their diameter .",
    "we can rewrite this expression in terms of aggregation numbers @xmath28 , @xmath50 and the volume of a subunit , @xmath35 , as @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the parameter associated with the _ form _ of a subunit . in the case of cubic subunits , @xmath53 , while for cylindrical subunits , @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the height of a cylinder .",
    "however , to apply this notation to the case of microtubules , we should note , that a microtubule has complex geometry .",
    "microtubules are hollow cylinders consisting of @xmath56 columns of tubulin on the surface.@xcite so , they grow up at @xmath57 places at the same time . thus , the length of a microtubule @xmath58 and @xmath59 . in the following",
    "we assume @xmath53 for simplicity .",
    "variation of the free energy ( [ fid ] ) , ( [ fint ] ) with respect to the concentration @xmath60 along with the constraint condition ( constr ) leads to the following expression    @xmath61    where @xmath1 is the lagrange multiplier , which can be eliminated with the help of the constraint ( [ constr ] ) .    introducing the average aggregation number of rods in the direction",
    "@xmath62 at height @xmath30 as    @xmath63    we can write the expression for the distribution function @xmath34 in a simpler form    @xmath64    to write the last equality we used the constraint condition ( [ constr ] )",
    ".    the final expressions could be considerably simplified if we note , that ( i ) there is no angular dependence in the isotropic phase , ( ii ) in the nematic phase we can split the distribution function @xmath34 in two parts,@xcite one dependent on the aggregation number , @xmath28 , and another dependent on spatial angles , @xmath33 .",
    "namely , we denote the length distribution function , @xmath65 with the normalization condition @xmath66 and the orientation distribution function @xmath67 with the normalization @xmath68 . with this ,",

    "we keep this nomenclature in order to be consistent with refs.@xcite in the isotropic phase @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 , so the expression for the free energy simplifies significantly .    in the next section",
    "we describe the concentration profile and the average length of the aggregates assuming that the solution of rods is homogeneous and isotropic for the whole range of @xmath30 .",

    "the form of the equations coincides with that in the absence of gravity,@xcite since the aggregates at the boundary have all the same potential energy and the gravitational field does not influence their behavior .",

    "the inner phase diagram ( dark pattern ) is the coexistence region in the absence of the field in accordance with refs.@xcite as we see , to induce the phase separation , @xmath115 should exceed some critical value , for small @xmath115 the aggregates are too short and the nematic phase never appears .",

    "the concentrations of coexisting phases tend to y - axis , while for flexible aggregates , there is a little gap , _",
    "i.e. _ stiff aggregates much easily form the nematic phase than the flexible ones .",
    "the gravitational field severely increases the coexistence region ( light pattern ) in both cases .",
    "so , for strong enough gravitational fields the left border can approach the y - axis , signifying the absence of the pure isotropic phase for high values of @xmath115 even for very low concentrations . this situation should be taken into account , when the self - assembled aggregates are subject to the ultracentrifugal field .     for @xmath206 ( thick line ) and @xmath240 ( thin line ) .",

    "the solution of four equations ( [ phin])-([eq2 ] ) along with the conservation of mass condition for each @xmath127 gives not only the average concentrations in the coexisting phases , it also gives the position of the phase boundary , @xmath216 , and the concentrations at the boundary , @xmath243 and @xmath233 .",
    "this information is enough to obtain the full concentration profile composed of two parts , @xmath244 at @xmath220 and @xmath120 at @xmath221 .",
    "this profiles can be converted into the average aggregation numbers in both phases : @xmath245 the resulting plot for different @xmath127 is shown in fig . 9 ( actually , we plot @xmath246 and thus , @xmath247 as explained in appendix ) . the average aggregation number in the isotropic phase exhibits the square root behavior on height , and it has almost linear dependence in the nematic phase in accordance to our previous estimates .",
    "the only exception is the region at the very bottom for high gravitational field @xmath219 , where @xmath248 does not depend on @xmath30 .",
    "this is because the concentration at the bottom for high gravitational fields is very high and the second virial approximation does not work .",
    "thus , after correcting this approximation , the sharp edge on the dashed curve should smooth out .",
    "the length of the concentration jump at the phase boundary does not depend on the field , since the field can only shift the phase boundary and it does not influence the equilibrium of the aggregates lying in the same height .",
    "as in the case of monodisperse rods of fixed length , the gravity can either increase or decrease the volume of the nematic phase depending on the total subunit concentration ( fig .",
    "if the total concentration is close to the isotropic phase boundary and the volume of the nematic phase is low , the gravitational field induces the increase of the nematic phase , so the volume increases until exhausting of the isotropic phase .",
    "since then , the volume gradually decreases indicating the sinking of the aggregates in the nematic phase ( solid line ) .",
    "if the total concentration is close to the nematic phase boundary , the aggregates in the nematic phase can only sink , decreasing the volume ( thin line ) .",
    "now , let us address the question of the _ polydispersity _ of the nematic and the isotropic phases in the gravitational field .",
    "the length distribution functions of aggregates in coexisting phases , @xmath239 and @xmath249 can be calculated as    @xmath250    the result is presented in fig .",
    "see appendix and especially eqs .",
    "( apni ) , ( [ apnn ] ) for the details of the calculation .",
    "the gravity induces the transition of subunits from the isotropic to the nematic phase .",
    "so , the area of the isotropic distribution function , @xmath239 , decreases with increasing gravity , while the area of @xmath251 increases with @xmath127 .",
    "nevertheless , the distribution of lengths in the nematic phase is much broader in the presence of the field , _ i.e. _ the gravity increases seriously the polydispersity of the nematic phase .",
    "this is for account of the fraction of extremely long aggregates induced by the gravity , while the fraction of short aggregates remains almost unchanged .",
    "the isotropic phase looses foremost long , and thus , heavy aggregates , but the change in its polydispersity is not so drastic as in the nematic phase . hence , _ the precipitation into nematic phase is more favorable process than the growth in the isotropic phase_. to describe the polydispersity of the whole two phase system , we can consider the sum of the length distribution functions , @xmath252 .",
    "the area of this function is proportional to the total number of subunits in the system , so its value is the same for any @xmath253 .",
    "the plot of @xmath254 is shown in the fig .",
    "it brings us to the conclusion that the system as a whole is more polydisperse in the gravitational field .",
    "sharply picked function in the absence of gravity fade out with increasing gravitational field .",
    "note , however , that the maximum of the curve almost does not change .",
    "this is the consequence of the redistribution of subunits between two phases without considerable growth of the aggregates .",
    "although the gravitational field is often neglected in the description of physicochemical processes , it may have noticeable influence on such biological heavy objects as microtubules or actin filaments , essential components of living cells .",
    "the equilibrium properties of such objects is influenced even by the earth gravitational acceleration .",
    "the fields in an ultracentrifuge can multiple the effect of gravity .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the major effects of the gravitational field on the process of self - assembly of linear aggregates .",
    "it is shown , that the concentration gradient induced by the gravitational field leads to the redistribution of aggregates of different lengths ( and thus , masses ) on different heights : the local concentration of the self - assembled rods interacting via the second virial coefficient decreases _ linearly _ with height in contrast to barometric distribution of aggregates with fixed length .",
    "this prediction can be directly checked experimentally in the rotating clinostat experiments . in turn , the average length of the aggregates has a square root dependence in contrast to hyperbolic dependence found for ideal aggregates.@xcite we also show , that except the redistribution of aggregates with height , the gravity induces the _ overall growth _ of the aggregates .",
    "the stiffness of the aggregates enhance the growth under gravity .",
    "strong enough gravitational field can provoke the isotropic to nematic phase transition , which is reflected in the significant broadness of the phase coexistence region .",
    "the transition manifests itself in the precipitation of the aggregates from the isotropic to the nematic phase regardless their length .",
    "furthermore , the length distribution of the aggregates is found to be very sensitive to the gravitational field : the gravity induces considerable polydispersity in the nematic phase .",
    "taken together , the effect of gravity can lead to a series of experimentally relevant observations which are interesting from fundamental point of view .",
    "equations @xmath255 ( [ mui ] ) , ( [ mun ] ) do not allow to obtain the analytical expression of local concentrations @xmath234 as a function of @xmath30 except for two asymptotes eqs .",
    "( [ phii ] ) , ( [ phinoni ] ) . to this end ,",
    "the total concentration , @xmath256 , and the average lengths , @xmath257 , are , in fact , the integral equations for the functions @xmath258 , the functional forms of which are determined from the chemical potentials . in general , it is rather difficult to solve such system of equations .",
    "however , we can employ the structure of equations ( [ mui ] ) , ( [ mun ] ) , which allows to get analytically the _ inverse _ functions , @xmath246 .",
    "namely , for the isotropic phase      here we assume the isotropic phase is situated above the phase boundary , @xmath260 , and the boundary concentration is @xmath261 . in case of the homogeneous phase , one can put in this expression @xmath236 .",
    "analogously , the inverse function for the nematic phase yields in the form                              solution of _ algebraic _ eqs .",
