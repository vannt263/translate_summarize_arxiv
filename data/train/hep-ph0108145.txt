    "the recent charged current measurement at the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite has shed more light on the long - standing problem posed by the previous solar neutrino data  @xcite forcing us to reconsider the status of the various solutions to the solar neutrino anomaly .",
    "in this paper we re - consider the case of spin - flavour precession solutions , based on non - zero transition magnetic moments of neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "these are especially attractive for several reasons : ( i ) on general theoretical grounds @xcite neutrinos are expected to be majorana particles ; ( ii ) such conversions induced by transition magnetic moments may be resonantly amplified in the sun  @xcite ; ( iii ) they offer the best pre - sno global fit of solar neutrino data  @xcite , and ( iv ) an sfp type solution , being an active  to  active conversion mechanism , has the right features to reconcile the sno cc and superkamiokande results",
    ".    finally , such solutions are rather robust if the arbitrariness in the choice of the magnetic field profile in the solar convective zone  @xcite is removed in a self - consistent way from magneto - hydrodynamics theory  @xcite .    by generalizing our previous work  @xcite to the case of non - zero neutrino",
    "mixing we obtain two new and important results : ( i ) we recover the resonant small - mixing solution to the solar neutrino problem found previously  @xcite and analyse its status in the light of the new sno and 1258day sk results , and ( ii ) we find a genuinely new non - resonant sfp solution in the so - called dark - side of the neutrino mixing parameter  @xcite .",
    "following @xcite we choose to determine the allowed solutions by considering only the total rates of the solar neutrino experiments , ignoring first all the data from the super - kamiokande measurements of the spectral energy distribution and the day - night variations .",
    "we find that these solutions , both the resonant spin flavour precession solution ( which we call rsfp ) as well as a new non - resonant one ( nrsfp solution ) , provide excellent descriptions of the solar rates , including the recent sno cc result .",
    "subsequently we demonstrate how these solutions predict a substantially flat recoil energy spectrum of solar neutrinos in agreement with the observations of the super - kamiokande experiment  @xcite",
    ". moreover , our solutions are consistent with the non - observation of electron anti ",
    "neutrinos from the sun  @xcite in the results of the lsd experiment  @xcite as well as superkamiokande  @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : neutr - conv - prob ] we discuss the neutrino evolution and conversion probabilities , in section  [ sec : calculational ] we summarize the calculational and fit procedures we adopt , while we summarize our results in section  [ sec : summary - discussion ] .",
    "motivated by the results from reactor neutrino experiments  @xcite and to some extent also from atmospheric neutrinos  @xcite we adopt , for simplicity , a two - flavour rsfp scenario .",
    "the majorana neutrino evolution hamiltonian in a magnetic field in this case is well  known to be four  dimensional  @xcite , @xmath4 where @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , assumed to be always positive , are the neutrino oscillation parameters ; @xmath8 is the neutrino transition magnetic moment ; @xmath9 , are the magnetic field components which are perpendicular to the neutrino trajectory ; @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the neutrino vector potentials for @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the sun , given by the number densities of the electrons ( @xmath14 ) and neutrons ( @xmath15 ) . when @xmath16 we recover the case treated in  @xcite while as @xmath17 we recover the pure osc case . in our calculations of @xmath18",
    "we use the electron and neutron number densities from the bp00 model @xcite with the magnetic field profile obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for k=6 and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume a transition magnetic moment of @xmath3 bohr magneton , consistent with experiment and a magnetic field magnitude around 80 kgauss , allowed by helioseismological observations .",
    "finally , in order to obtain earth matter effects we integrate numerically the evolution equation in the earth matter using the earth density profile given in the preliminary reference earth model ( prem ) @xcite .",
    "the combined amplitude for a solar @xmath20 to be detected as @xmath21 ( @xmath22 being e , @xmath8 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 ) with energy @xmath25 at a detector in the earth can be written as : @xmath26~ \\ , . \\label{amplitud}\\ ] ]    here @xmath27 is the amplitude of the transition @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the @xmath30-mass eigenstate ) from the production point to the sun surface , @xmath31 is the amplitude of the transition @xmath32 from the earth surface to the detector , and the propagation in vacuum from the sun to the surface of the earth is given by the exponential , where @xmath33 is the distance between the center of the sun and the surface of the earth , and @xmath34 is the radius of the sun . while the presence of magnetic field couples the four states in the evolution , its absence in vacuum and in the earth produces the decoupling of the four states into two doublets : ( @xmath20 , @xmath35 ) and ( @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) .",
    "the corresponding probabilities @xmath38 are then given by : @xmath39 here @xmath40 is the probability that the solar neutrinos reach the surface of the sun as @xmath41 , while latexmath:[$p_{i \\alpha } \\equiv    at the surface of the earth to be detected as @xmath21 .",
    "the phases @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are given by @xmath45 where @xmath46 contain the phases due to propagation in the sun and in the earth and we checked that it can be safely neglected for our purposes .",
    "the results presented in the following sections have been obtained using the general expression for the probabilities with @xmath47,@xmath48,@xmath49 and @xmath50 found by numerically solving the evolution equation  ( [ master ] ) .",
    "the probabilities required in eq .",
    "( [ pee ] ) are not independent from the last ones and can be obtained using the unitarity relations and using relations between both octants in mixing for the evolution in the earth , ie . , @xmath51 .",
    "in the limit @xmath52 we recover the forms given in ref .  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] we show a schematic view of the spin flavour precession survival probabilties both in the `` light '' and `` dark '' sides .",
    "the first corresponds to @xmath53 while the latter means @xmath54 .",
    "the dotted curve corresponds to the rsfp case , while the solid one will lead to the new non - resonant nrsfp solution , see below .",
    "one notices that , in contrast to the oscillation case , the asymptotic value of the survival probability in the sfp model can be lower than 0.5 as @xmath55 or @xmath56 .",
    "this can be understood as follows .",
    "consider the idealized case of constant matter potential , constant magnetic field over a finite slab @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "in this case one can write simple analytic formulae for the neutrino conversion probabilities .",
    "for example the @xmath20 survival probability may be given as @xmath59 for the case @xmath60 we obtain the well - known resonant solution , while the alternative @xmath61 choice corresponds to our new nrsfp solution in the dark side , see below .",
    "the higher asymptotic suppresion of @xmath62 in both cases implies a higher possible degree of suppression of @xmath63 b neutrinos than achievable in the osc case .",
    "moreover the converted @xmath64 can be detected via the neutral current , thus reconciling the sno cc result with the higher super - kamiokande rate measurement .",
    "in our following description of solar neutrino data  @xcite we adopt the analysis techniques which have already been presented in previous papers  @xcite using the theoretical bp00 standard solar model best  fit fluxes and estimated uncertainties from ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the solar data  @xcite we also use the reactor data  @xcite as well as the data on searches for anti - neutrinos from the sun  @xcite . for the neutrino conversion probabilities we use the numerical results calculated in the previous section .",
    "we employ the self - consistent magneto - hydrodynamics magnetic field profile obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for k=6 and @xmath65 .",
    "the resulting theoretical framework has therefore only 2 effective free parameters : @xmath0 , @xmath66 .",
    "the remaining parameter @xmath1 characterizing the maximum magnitude of the magnetic field in the convective zone has been fixed at its optimum value . since the parameter space is three - dimensional , the allowed regions for a given c.l .",
    "are defined as the set of points satisfying the condition @xmath67 where @xmath68 contains @xmath69 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 in order to account for the data on searches for anti - neutrinos from the sun  @xcite . as we will see this term plays an important role in restricting the neutrino parameters .    in our numerical calculations",
    "we use the survival / conversion probabilities of solar electron neutrino valid in the full range of @xmath0 and @xmath2 , selecting the optimum value of @xmath72 with @xmath73 varying over the range from 0 to 100 kgauss  .    finally , we employ the relevant reaction cross sections and efficiencies for the all experiments used in ref .  @xcite . for the sno case",
    "the cc cross section for deuterium was taken from  @xcite .      here",
    "we take into account the total rates in the chlorine , gallium , and super - kamiokande experiments , the sno cc result and the anti - neutrino limit from lsd , and also the reactor neutrino data  @xcite .",
    "the rates from the gallex / gno experiments have been averaged so as to provide a unique data point .",
    "the resulting number of degrees of freedom is therefore 4 : 4 ( rates ) + sno + lsd @xmath742 ( parameters : @xmath75 , @xmath2 ) with a fixed @xmath1 .",
    "we present in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratesonly ] the allowed solutions for the two - flavour sfp case .",
    "these include the pure two - neutrino oscillation case , as well as the convenitional rsfp and the new nrsfp solution .",
    "allowed solutions to the solar neutrino rates and reactor data for @xmath76 and @xmath77 kgauss .",
    "the upper limit on the solar anti - neutrino flux according to lsd data is included.,height=453 ]    note that the contours refer to 90% , 99% cl defined with respect to the global minimum of @xmath78 .",
    "we find that both lma and sma oscillation solutions are recovered without an essential change due to the effect of the magnetic moment .",
    "the sma solution appears ( even though disfavored ) , but leads to an unacceptably tilted recoil energy spectrum , as will be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] .    an important point to notice",
    "is that this plot lacks the low solution as well as the characteristic region joining it through the dark side to the vacuum - type solutions  @xcite . in this figure",
    "we have adjusted the value of @xmath1 to its best value ( for @xmath79 bohr magneton this corresponds to @xmath80 kgauss ) .",
    "one sees that the relatively large @xmath8 value has important consequences .",
    "it leads in this case in the complete absence of all large mixing solutions other than the lma solution due to the effect magnetic field .",
    "such a value implies an important modification in the neutrino survival probability implying an unwanted over - suppression of the @xmath63b neutrino flux and therefore the impossibility to account for all experiments in this region because of the high @xmath81 flux . from this point of view vacuum - type solutions",
    "are _ unstable _ against the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "in fact the non - lma large mixing osc solutions are not re - instated even if the @xmath63b neutrino flux is left free .",
    "the goodness of fit of the various solutions in fig .",
    "[ fig : ratesonly ] is given in table  1 .",
    "one notices that , of the osc - type solutions , lma is the best",
    ". however the sfp solutions are slightly better .",
    "lcccc solution&@xmath0&@xmath82 & @xmath83 & g.o.f .",
    "+ lma & @xmath84 & @xmath85 & 3.99 & @xmath86% + sma & @xmath87 & @xmath88 & 5.25 & @xmath89% + rsf & @xmath90 & @xmath91 & 2.98 & @xmath92% + nrsf & @xmath93 & @xmath94 & 3.83 & @xmath95% +    note that the goodness - of - fit given in the last column is calculated using the value of @xmath96 for each allowed solution corresponding to each of the local minima of table  1 .",
    "note also that should we perform a restricted two - parameter analysis using only @xmath97 and the neutrino mixing angle @xmath2 for the pure osc case and only @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the pure sfp case we obtain exactly the same goodness - of - fit and @xmath98 for each of the corresponding sfp and osc solutions in table  1 .",
    "a more striking feature of fig .  [ fig : ratesonly ] is the appearance of two new solutions which are totally due to the effect of the magnetic field .",
    "one contains the previous resonant no - mixing solution which is recovered , after updating the solar data to the measurements from 1258 days of super - kamiokande data and sno cc measurement .",
    "one sees that this rsfp solution extends up to @xmath66 values around @xmath99 or so .",
    "more importantly , one finds a genuinely new non - resonant ( nrsfp ) solution in the `` dark - side '' of the parameter space , for large @xmath66 values .",
    "the existence of these solutions can be easily understood on the basis of fig .",
    "[ fig : prob ] .",
    "similarly one can understand the non - resonant nature of the new nrsfp solution .",
    "note that in obtaining the shape of the rsf solutions we have made use of the data on searches for anti - neutrinos from the sun  @xcite .",
    "these play an important role in cutting the non - resonant rsf solution to @xmath66 values larger than about 30 .",
    "we now present the predicted day  night averaged   spectral energy distribution for our two spin flavour precession solutions and compare it with those of the pure osc - type solutions .     predicted recoil energy spectra for spin flavour precession solutions .",
    "details in text.,height=453 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spec ] we present the recoil energy spectra for spin flavour precession .",
    "the thin solid horizontal line corresponds to the new nrsfp solution , while the dot - dashed refers to the standard rsfp solution .",
    "clearly both spin flavour precession spectra are totally consistent with the super - kamiokande data and , as a result , will remain as excellent solutions after the inclusion of the recoil energy spectra .",
    "we also present the predicted oscillation spectra , in solid that of the sma solution and dashed the lma solution .",
    "clearly one can see that , in contrast with the rsfp and nrsfp solutions , the sma spectrum is in strong disagreement with the sk data .",
    "a full - fledged global fit of the recoil spectra for the spin flavour solutions is outside the scope of this letter and will be presented elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "in this paper we have re - considered the case of spin - flavour precession solutions , based on non - zero transition magnetic moments of majorana neutrinos taking into account the recent sno cc result as well as the 1258day solar neutrino data from super - kamiokande .",
    "we have also payed attention to the upper limit on the solar anti - neutrino flux from the lsd experiment as well as the reactor neutrino data .",
    "we have followed the self - consistent approach from magneto - hydrodynamics theory employed previously  @xcite in order to remove the arbitrariness associated to the magnetic field profile  @xcite .",
    "this effectively reduces the theoretical analysis framework to a three - parameter one .",
    "in - so - doing we have also generalized our previous work  @xcite to the case of non - zero neutrino mixing , performing the first `` unified '' study of solar neutrino data in the presence of a neutrino transition magnetic moment .",
    "it contains as particular cases `` light - side '' and `` dark - side '' osc as well as genuine sfp solutions .",
    "we have recovered the standard resonant small - mixing solution to the solar neutrino problem ( rsfp ) which remains as best solution to the solar neutrino anomaly ( see table ) .",
    "second , we have found a genuinely new non - resonant solution in the so - called `` dark - side '' of the neutrino mixing parameter . such nrsfp solution gives a very good fit of the present solar neutrino data .",
    "although we have chosen to determine the allowed solutions by considering only the total rates of the solar neutrino experiments , we have presented their predicted recoil spectra , showing how they are in agreement with the data from the super - kamiokande experiment .",
