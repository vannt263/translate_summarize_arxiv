    "the possibility of ferromagnetic phase transition in dense quark matter was first discussed by tatsumi@xcite where it was shown that quark liquid interacting through one gluon exchange shows spontaneous magnetic instability at low densities .",
    "such an investigation was motivated by the observation of strong magnetic field in neutron star . moreover ,",
    "the theoretical conjectures about the possible existence of quark stars provide additional impetus to examine this issue further @xcite .",
    "the underlying mechanism of such a phase transition for slow moving massive quark is similar to what one observes in case of interacting electron gas @xcite in a neutralizing positive charge background where the electron interact only by the exchange interaction and the contribution of the direct term cancels with the background contribution . in case of interacting electron gas",
    ", the kinetic energy is minimum in unpolarized state , the exchange energy , on the other hand , favors spin alignment .",
    "these are two competing phenomenon which also depends on density .",
    "it is seen that the kinetic energy dominates at higher density and as the density is lowered the exchange energy becomes larger at some point turning the electron gas suddenly into a completely polarized state .",
    "this is the mechanism of ferromagnetism in electron gas interacting via .",
    "coulomb potential @xcite .",
    "the exchange energy for quark matter interacting via one gluon exchange ( oge ) is also attractive and becomes dominant at some density giving rise to ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "however , there are similarities and differences between quark matter and electron gas as discussed in ref.@xcite . for slow moving massive quarks",
    "the dynamics is very similar to what happens in electron gas , while in the relativistic case a completely different mechanism works when spin dependent lower component of the dirac spinor becomes important .",
    "it should also be noted that the exchange energy is negative for massive strange quark at low densities while it is always positive for massless u and d quark as observed in @xcite and subsequently in @xcite .",
    "the magnetic property of the quark matter was also studied in @xcite by evaluating the effective potential by employing magnetic moment of a quark and treating this as an order parameter . unlike @xcite , in this model u , d and s quarks _",
    "i.e. _ all of these flavors , show ferromagnetic phase transition at various densities . in @xcite , we revisited this problem and have evaluated fermi liquid parameters for a spin polarized quark matter which were subsequently used to derive single particle spectrum and total energy density as a function of the @xmath2 .",
    "there it was shown that such a phase transition within the oge model and parameter set of ref.@xcite , is possible at very low density .",
    "in @xcite and @xcite calculations were restricted only to the hartree fock level and the higher order terms were ignored .",
    "the computation of the ground state energy on the other hand requires evaluation of the diagrams beyond the exchange loop _",
    "viz . _ the inclusion of correlation energy as emphasized in ref.@xcite .",
    "this is rather tricky as the higher order terms are plagued by infrared divergences due to the exchange of massless bosons like gluons ( or photons ) indicating the failure of naive perturbation theory .",
    "the problem can be handled by summing a class of diagrams which makes the perturbation series convergent and receives logarithmic corrections . in the case of degenerate electron matter",
    "this pioneering work was done by gell - mann and brueckner ( gb ) commonly known as gb theory where the ` correlation energy @xmath0 ' of an electron gas at high density was calculated @xcite .",
    "the correlation energy is actually the higher order correction to the ground state energy beyond the exchange term in the perturbation series defined by @xcite    e_corr = e - e_ex - e_kin    here , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 correspond to correlation , exchange , kinetic energy density respectively .",
    "in general for electron gas interacting via .",
    "coulomb force it takes the following form @xcite    [ rs_expan ] e_corr = a + c + o(r_s )    at large fermi momentum @xmath5 i.e. in the limit @xmath6 , the result becomes exact @xcite . for the case of electron gas ,",
    "the inverse density is set equal to @xmath7 and the dimensionless parameter @xmath8 is defined as @xmath9 divided by bohr radius @xcite .",
    "we here , derive a similar expression for the dense quark matter with arbitrary spin polarization with appropriate modifications .",
    "the model adopted in the present work is same as that of ref.@xcite except here we go beyond @xmath10 and include ring diagrams to evaluate the correlation energy of spin polarized quark matter .",
    "this , together with the contribution of @xmath4 and @xmath3 , as we shall see , has the small @xmath11 expansion    [ xi_expan ] e & = & e(=0)+_s ^2 + .....    here , @xmath12 , is defined to be the spin stiffness constant in analogy with @xcite with @xmath13 .",
    "it is to be noted that in eq.([xi_expan ] ) first term corresponds to unpolarized matter with correlation energy having the form of eq.([rs_expan ] ) .",
    "clearly , this is reminiscent of what one obtains for the degenerate electron gas @xcite .",
    "the derivation of @xmath1 here requires the evaluation of the gluon self - energy in spin asymmetric quark matter which can be used to construct the in - medium one loop corrected gluon propagator with explicit spin parameter dependence .",
    "apart from the calculation of correlation energy , this might have applications in evaluation , for example , of the fermi liquid parameter ( flp ) in spin polarized matter or spin susceptibility or quantities which can be expressed in terms of flps @xcite . in the present work ,",
    "we however , restrict ourselves to the evaluation of the ring diagrams only .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we derive the expression for gluon self energy in polarized quark matter - an essential ingredient for the calculation of correlation energy . in sec .",
    "iii , we calculate ground state energy with correlation correction for the polarized matter .",
    "subsequently , we also compare exchange and correlation energy density . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize and conclude .",
    "the detailed expression of various matrix elements required to evaluate polarization tensor have been relegated to the appendix .",
    "to calculate the correlation energy of spin polarized quark matter one needs to calculate the gluon self energy in matter with arbitrary spins .",

    "clearly the critical density at which the spin - polarized ferromagnetic state might appear depends strongly on the quark mass and the critical density increases with increasing mass , this might change our numerical estimates .    further uncertainty to the estimation of the critical density from the present analysis comes from the fact that we here restrict ourselves only to oge diagrams and one flavor system . in this regime ,",
