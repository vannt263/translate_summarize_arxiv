    "renormalization group ( rg ) flow equations pioneered by wilson and kadanoff allow for a prediction on the behavior of a interacting theory in different momentum regimes  @xcite .",
    "when probing physics in the infrared ( ir ) it is often useful to derive a low - energy effective theory by integrating over the irrelevant short - distance ( high momenta ) modes .",
    "thus one is left with a so - called wilsonian or low - energy effective action distinguishing it from the one - particle - irreducible ( 1pi ) effective action .    in order to separate the fast - fluctuating short - distance modes from the slowly - varying ones",
    "one has to introduce a momentum scale @xmath0 , which appears naturally in the momentum cutoff regularization .",
    "the momentum cutoff regularization can be formulated by means of a blocking transformation .",
    "this procedure is achieved by introducing a so - called smearing or ir cutoff function @xmath1 , which suppresses the fast - fluctuating modes of the original unblocked fields  @xcite . in that way the fields",
    "are naturally separated into fast and slow mode components .",
    "the integration over the fast modes corresponds to the blocking transformation on the lattice .",
    "this results in an effective action parameterized by the averaged blocked field at the scale @xmath0 . the full 1pi feynman graphs or vertex functions ,",
    "providing the natural tool for the study of broken symmetries in interacting field theories , are generated by the renormalized effective action in the limit @xmath2 .",
    "thus the @xmath0-dependent effective action provides a smooth interpolation between the bare action defined at the uv scale @xmath3 , where no quantum fluctuations are considered and the renormalized effective action in the ir .",
    "the rg flow pattern of the theory is obtained by studying an infinitesimal change of the ir scale @xmath0 , in the effective @xmath0-dependent action . a nice introduction to this topic",
    "can be found in the recent lecture  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , this integration step can not be computed in an exact way and one has to perform some approximation like the frequently used loop expansion .",
    "based on an one - loop expression with a heat - kernel ( proper - time ) regularization we derive renormalization group improved flow equation and study different expansion pattern .",
    "it is well known that a sharp momentum cutoff regularization is in conflict with the gauge invariance  @xcite .",
    "the crucial task is to implement both the uv and the ir cutoff scales without destroying the important symmetries . for such reasons we use the operator cutoff regularization in schwinger s proper - time representation  @xcite which neither depends on the dimension nor violates any symmetry of the theory .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ introrg ] we define the model lagrangian and give a general introduction to the renormalization flow equation using the heat - kernel regularization and different choices of the cutoff function . in section  [ expansion ]",
    "we approximate the potential by a polynomial expansion and derive the zero temperature coupled flow equations . here",
    "we also present the diagrammatic interpretation of the equations .",
    "temperature is introduced in section  [ finitet ] and the flow equations associated with the expansion of the potential are shown for different cutoff functions . in section  [ result0 ]",
    "we present our results at zero temperature , comparing the results of the expansion technique at different orders to exact grid solutions of the flow equations . in section",
    "[ critical ] the finite temperature calculations are presented and we discuss the sensitivity of the critical temperature on the expansion parameter , while in section  [ exponent ] the behavior of the critical exponent , @xmath4 , is studied .",
    "finally , in section  [ conclusion ] we conclude by critically assessing the feasibility of finite - density calculations using the expansion technique .",
    "since the intention is to study the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry by matching the short - distance regime of qcd with the large - distance behavior in the framework of evolution equations we consider an effective theory which incorporates simultaneously quark fields and composite mesonic fields as the active degrees of freedom .",
    "a suitable choice is the linear sigma model with @xmath5 and @xmath6mesons coupled to @xmath7 constituent quarks .",
    "the partition function in the chiral limit and without external sources is given by the euclidean - space path integral [ zz1 ] z & = & q d|q d \\{- d^4x ( l_f + l_b ) } , with a fermionic part including a yukawa coupling constant @xmath8 , [ fermil ] l_f & = & |q ( + g ( + i_5 ) ) q , and a bosonic lagrangian part [ bosel ] l_b & = & ( ( _ ) ^2 + ( _ ) ^2 ) + v(^2+^2 ) , respectively",
    ". the mesonic self - interaction is parameterized by the potential term @xmath9 . at finite temperature the integration in the action along the temporal direction",
    "is understood on the stripe @xmath10 $ ] where @xmath4 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the parameters of the linear @xmath5-model are fixed at zero temperature as in ref .  @xcite . because the theory is strongly coupled we can not calculate the low - energy theory directly .",
    "we assume that at an ultraviolet scale @xmath11 gev , the full @xmath12 dynamics reduces to a hybrid description in terms of ( massless ) current quarks and chiral bound states .",
    "the gluons are frozen in the residual mesonic degrees of freedom , their couplings and the _ effective _ potential @xmath13 which , at this scale @xmath3 , takes the following form : v _ ( ^2 ) = ^2 + ^4 , [ eq : pot ] = ( , ) is an @xmath14-symmetric vector .",
    "both @xmath15 and the four - boson coupling @xmath16 , are positive .",
    "during the course of iteratively including quantum fluctuation from a restricted scale range the potential and accordingly all couplings become @xmath0-dependent . in this work",
    "we neglect the evolution of the yukawa coupling @xmath8 , and set it equal a constant value of @xmath17 in order to reproduce the constituent quark mass @xmath18 mev , with the pion decay constant @xmath19 mev , in the infrared .    the one - loop contribution to the effective action yields in general a non - local logarithm , which is ultraviolet divergent and needs to be regularized .",
    "this regularization is based on the general proper - time representation introduced by schwinger  @xcite . after introducing a complete set of plane waves we are lead to the following one - loop correction to the effective action for the bosons [ gammab ]",
    "^b = -d^4 x _",

    "thus the total effective action becomes a sum of both terms @xmath21 each depending on @xmath20 .",
    "for details we refer the reader to ref .",
    "@xcite .",

    "we modify the above expressions by introducing a regulating function @xmath25 into the proper - time integrand which separates the `` fast '' and `` slow '' fluctuating modes as well as respects the important symmetries of the considered theory  @xcite .",
    "of course , the form of the regularized flow equations does depend on the choice of the a priori unknown blocking function @xmath1 . in order to find an explicit form for @xmath1 one is lead by the following conditions :    * ( 1 ) * the modified @xmath0-dependent effective action @xmath26 should tend to the full generating functional @xmath27 in the ir limit @xmath2 , i.  e.  when the infrared cutoff @xmath1 , is removed .",

    "[ fig3 ] ) , in accordance with a slope parameter of 2 found in  @xcite in the case of the njl - model .    the asymptotic behavior of the expansion coefficients @xmath105 ,",
    "may be studied analytically in the @xmath106 limit of the broken phase . since in this",
    "limit the relevant quantity @xmath107 is approaching infinity , the matsubara sum may be replaced by its lowest - order contribution . keeping the leading - order terms in the momentum scale @xmath0 , we arrive at b_2i for @xmath108 and up to @xmath109 .",
    "once again the coefficients are divergent for @xmath110 shrinking the convergence radius of the expansion to one point .",
    "our numerical results show a second - order phase transition in the order parameter @xmath83 , that is the order parameter vanishes continuously with a critical exponent @xmath4 , @xmath111 . a typical plot , for @xmath112 ,",
    "is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ( right ) , in the scaling window of the model .",
    "the critical exponent @xmath4 , is only slighlty sensitive to the order of the polynomial expansion and cutoff used and agrees with the three - dimensional scalar @xmath14-heisenberg model value , @xmath113 . for comparison lattice monte carlo simulations yield @xmath114 @xcite , @xmath115 expansion @xmath116 @xcite and the average action approach @xmath117 @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ criti ] we demonstrate the order dependence @xmath54 of the critical exponent for the different cutoff functions ( i)-(iii ) and compared our values with the one in the literature : the shadowed region represents the value region obtained in different calculations .",
    "despite the fact that the convergence of the pion decay constant and critical temperature was poor ( even absent ) in the case of the cutoff function ( i ) , the critical exponent @xmath4 , is still quite well in agreement with the @xmath14-model value . for the higher cutoff functions ( ii ) and ( iii )",
    "the convergence becomes more and more stable , however , a systematic decrease with the order @xmath84 , of the cutoff functions is observed in the direction of the value obtained by the @xmath115 expansion and the mc calculations .",
    "this decrease persists further at @xmath90 , @xmath118 approaching closer to the @xmath115 expansion value .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the size of the scaling window for different cutoff functions . at @xmath90",
    "we found that the window starts at the values of @xmath119 17% , 7% , 2.7% and 0.8% for cutoffs",
    "( i ) through ( iv ) , respectively .",
    "this indicates a widening of the scaling regime for lower monomial cutoff functions .",
    "we have studied a model lagrangian of quarks and mesons with renormalization group equations based on an one - loop expansion within the local potential approximation , for different cutoff functions . expanding the meson potential in polynomials @xmath120 , of degree @xmath54 around its minimum",
    ", we found that the lowest order cutoff function ( i ) , related to the wegner - houghton equation with a sharp cutoff has serious convergence problems .",
    "increasing the order of the cutoff function applied , the convergence in the order of the potential expansion @xmath54 , increases rapidly , already with the next cutoff function ( ii ) , the expansion in the potential is within 25% for @xmath85 ( @xmath121 theory ) . in order to get results closer to the full potential ( grid ) calculation however , one has to take higher corrections into account .",
    "the analysis of the critical behavior in ref .",
    "@xcite has shown that the `` magnetization '' @xmath20 , is related to the external source @xmath122 , ( the current quark mass in the present model ) as @xmath123 with the critical index @xmath124 .",
    "hence the effective potential has the dependence @xmath125 around the minimum .",
    "this explains the necessity to have at least terms with @xmath126 corresponding to @xmath127 in the effective potential near @xmath128 .",
    "our study shows that for cutoff function ( ii ) with @xmath89 expansion yields stable results and close to the full grid simulation for several global quantities ( such as the pion decay constant , the chiral symmetry breaking scale @xmath82 , and the critical temperature @xmath128 ) .",
    "however , for local quantities , such as the potential itself , increasing order gives less and less reliable shape ( the convergence radius of the expansion defines a smaller and smaller interval around the minimum ) , deviating from the full grid calculation .",
    "this means , that studies involving first - order phase transition ( as encountered at finite baryon density  @xcite ) can not be treated in such a model up to the infrared scale , since the two minima are separated further than the convergence radius and can not be calculated reliably .",
    "the problem may be addressed using full grid calculations or other expansion basis may be considered , however , for finite density such a basis should include non - analytical functions .",
