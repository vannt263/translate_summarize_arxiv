    "the outburst of a nova originates from thermonuclear ( tnr ) runaway on the surface of a white dwarf when material accreted from a companion reaches critical conditions for ignition .",
    "the accreted envelope is electron degenerate , a fact that leads to violent mass ejection into surrounding emptiness ( if the donor is a dwarf ) or into thick circumstellar material ( if the wd orbits within the wind of a cool giant companion ) .",
    "the variety of nova phenomena is further enriched by the dependence on wd mass ( as the velocity and amount of ejected material ) , the diffusion and mixing of underlying wd material into the accreted envelope ( outburst strength and chemistry ) , the common - envelope interaction with the companion star ( such as 3d morphology of the ejecta and duration of the post - tnr stable nuclear burning ) , and the viewing angle ( especially for highly structured ejecta composed of bipolar flows , equatorial tori , diffuse prolate components and winds or bow - shocks ) .",
    "bode & evans ( 2012 ) and woudt & ribeiro ( 2014 ) has provided extensive , recent reviews about classical novae .    given the range of observable phenomena , a comprehensive description of a nova would obviously benefits from the widest wavelength and epoch coverage , including the pre - outburst properties of the progenitor . while rampant fields like x - ray imaging / spectra ( eg .",

    "this last point is discussed in more detail in sect.3 below .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to present extensive @xmath0 lightcurves of seven recent novae , all appearing at deep southern declinations , well below those accessible with the asiago telescopes that we regularly use to follow spectroscopically novae appearing north of @xmath1025@xmath11 .",

    "nothing comprehensive has been yet published on these exciting observations other than preliminary announcements on atels , and for only the two oldest program novae ( v1534 sco and v1535 sco ) , a comprehensive study of their near - ir spectra has been accomplished ( joshi et al .",

    "our photometric mapping started within one day of nova announcement and extended until solar conjunction set in or the nova completed its evolution .",

    "the advantages offered by building the lightcurve of a nova from data provided by a single telescope ( and thus not the result of the combination of sparse data from a variety of different telescopes ) are relevant , even if frequently overlooked or not fully appreciated .",
    "we do not refer - although very relevant themselves - to differences in the quality of data acquisition / reduction / calibration carried out at each telescope , nor to the effect of difference in focal length and psf purity in the crowded fields where novae usually appear .",
    "we restrict to consider here the ideal case in which all aspects of data acquisition and reduction have been carried out state - of - the - art and crowding is not an issue .    the spectral energy distribution of a nova is dominated by strong emission lines , the more so as the nova declines .",
    "while standard color - equations ( either for the all - sky and the local photometric sequence approaches ) can essentially null the differences ( for normal stars and standard filter sets ) between the standard photometric system and its local instantaneous realization ( with the time- and @xmath17-dependent atmospheric transmission as a key component of the optical train ) , this is hardly so for objects whose spectra are dominated by emission lines .",
    "let s consider the landolt @xmath15 band for example , with similar reasoning applicable to other bands or other photometric systems . as discussed in detail in munari",
    "( 2013a ) , much of the flux through the @xmath15 band during the optically thin phase of feii - novae comes from the [ oiii ] nebular doublet .",
    "the doublet is located on the steeply rising long - pass edge of the @xmath15 band profile , where small differences in the transmission of the photometric filters cause large deviations in the flux collected from the nova .",
    "similarly , during the optically thick phase of heavily reddened novae of both the feii and he / n types , a non - negligible fraction of the flux through the @xmath15 band comes from the h@xmath18 emission line .",
    "h@xmath18 is located at the red wing of the @xmath15 band , were the transmission of an actual filter can go from null up to several % of the peak value .    in the top panel of figure  1",
    "we have plot the transmission profile of the @xmath15 band as locally realized by some of the most popular attempts to match and standardize the original johnson & morgan ( 1953 ) @xmath19 photometric system ( cousins 1980 , graham 1982 , bessell 1990 , straizys 1992 , landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the differences along the whole band profile are quite obvious . yet , proper handling of the color - equations can essentially null such differences when dealing with the smooth , continuum - dominated and black - body like spectral energy distribution of normal stars",
    ".    the lower three panels of figure  1 overplot to the spectra of three novae the transmission profiles of the set of @xmath15 filters measured in the laboratory by munari & moretti ( 2012 ) with a spectrometer over the 2000   to 1.1 @xmath13 m range ( so to check for either blue or red leaks ) .",
    "these filters come from the main manufacturers in the field and , prior to measurement , have been subject to at least one year of continuous operation at the telescope ( thus exposed to large and continuous changes in barometric pressure , temperature and humidity ) .",
    "the filters are of two types .",
    "those following the bessell ( 1990 ) recipe for sandwich of schott colored glasses ( 2 mm of gg495 + 3 mm of bg39 ) are plotted in orange , the others are of the multi - layer dielectric type and are plotted in red .",
    "the nova spectra are examples taken from our long term monitoring of all novae accessible with the asiago telescopes .",
    "nova aql 2013 and nova oph 2009 are two heavily reddened novae , of respectively the feii and he / n types , as observed during the early decline from maximum .",
    "nova mon 2012 is a low reddening feii nova as observed during the optically thin phase , at a time when the super - soft phase was over .    to accurately simulate actual observations of these novae with the different @xmath15 filters plotted in the lower panels of figure  1 we proceeded the following way .",
    "the nights when these spectra of the three novae were observed were clear and all - sky photometric .",
    "several blue and red spectrophotometric standard stars were observed at different airmass during each night .",
    "on the fully - extracted , but not flux - calibrated spectra of the standards , we computed the instrumental magnitude in the @xmath19 filters which transmission profile is fully covered by our 3200 - 7700   spectra . these instrumental magnitudes ( plus reference tabular values ) were used with normal photometric data - reduction techniques to solve the color - equations to transform from the local to the standard photometric system . while the @xmath20 and @xmath3 band profiles were kept fixed to those tabulated by landolt ( 1992 ) , for the @xmath15 band profile we in turn adopted each one of those plotted in bottom panels of figure  1 .",
    "the all - sky inter - calibration of the standard stars provided stable results at 0.01 mag level in all bands whatever the choice for the @xmath15 profile was .",
    "the @xmath15 magnitude derived in the same way for the novae changed instead from one @xmath15 filter to another .",
    "the range of the computed @xmath15 magnitudes is ( cf figure  1 ) 0.05 mag for nova aql 2013 , 0.11 mag for nova oph 2009 , and 0.51 mag for nova mon 2012 . for the heavily reddened nova aql 2013 and nova oph 2009 ,",
    "the bluer wavelengths going through the @xmath15 passband contribute essentially nothing to the recorded flux . in such conditions , the fact that the transmission profile of a given filter is null or is it still transmitting something at h@xmath18 wavelength is the reason for the different magnitude derived for the nova .",
    "obviously , the wider the equivalent width of h@xmath18 , the larger is @xmath16 , as the comparison of nova aql 2013 ( e.w.(h@xmath18)=330  ) and nova oph 2009 ( e.w.(h@xmath18)=770  ) clearly illustrates . for the nebular spectrum of nova mon 2012 ( lowest panel of figure  1 ) , the line responsible for much of the filter - to - filter differences is [ oiii ] , which dominates ( with its e.w.(h@xmath18)=8800  ) the flux going through the @xmath15 band .",
    "the [ oiii ] doublet is located right on the steeply ascending branch of the @xmath15 band transmission profile , where filter - to - filter differences are the largest .",
    "the conclusion seems straightforward .",
    "if state - of - the - art photometry is collected with only one telescope ( always the same filters , detector , comparison sequence , data reduction procedures ) , any glitch present in a densely mapped lightcurve will probably be true , something connected to a real change in the physical conditions experienced by the nova . on the contrary , if the lightcurve of a nova is built from data obtained independently at different telescopes observing at different epochs , there is a serious risk that any feature is an artefact caused by the mixed data sources and it is not intrinsic to the nova .",
    "in addition to those recorded by ans collaboration , an excellent example of single - telescope lightcurves of novae are those obtained by the smarts project ( walter et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "application of medium- and narrow - band filters to the photometry of novae would overcome the problems caused by the mixed presence of both continuum and emission lines within the transmission profile of broad photometric bands , segregating the contribution of pure continuum from that of emission lines .",
    "the evolution of nova del 2013 during the first 500 days of its eruption has been monitored by munari et al .",

    "this study highlights the great diagnostic potential of such a combined approach in carrying out the photometry of nova outbursts .",

    "the results are listed in table  3 and in the sections below aiming to individual objects ..",
    "the characteristic rates @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the time ( in days ) that a nova takes to decline in @xmath15 band by , respectively , 2 and 3 magnitudes below maximum brightness .",
    "this quantity is obviously wavelength - dependent , considering the significant color evolution presented by a nova around maximum .",
    "duerbeck ( 2008 ) proposed a mean relation @xmath26=1.75@xmath5@xmath25 . for our program novae",
    "we obtain @xmath26=1.54@xmath5@xmath25 ( @xmath27=0.22 ) .",

    "the distance to a nova is usually estimated via calibrated relations ( called mmrd ) between absolute magnitude at maximum and rate of decline @xmath31 , either in the form @xmath32 or the stretched s - shaped curve @xmath33 first introduced by capaccioli et al .",

    "these three values for the absolute magnitude are in good mutual agreement ( mean deviation from mean value is 0.15 mag ) , with perhaps a slight tendency to be fainter for values computed from @xmath25 .",
    "the distance given in table  3 is computed from the mean value of the absolute magnitude as provided by the three @xmath25 , @xmath26 and s - curve methods .",

    "compared to the total extinction along the line of sight provided by the 3d maps of schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 , hereafter sfd98 ) and schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 , sf11 ) , the extinction computed from eq.(1 ) is nearly identical for four program novae , and a fraction of it for other two .",

    "the problem in this case is that the plateau occoured two weeks before the ejecta turned optically thin on day 27 past optical maximum .",
    "a way out could be a highly structured , non - spherical shape of the ejecta , with optical thickness strongly dependent on angular coordinates",

    "the time delay between maximum brightness reached in different photometric bands can be then expressed as @xmath78 with @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the ejected mass and @xmath67 the ejection velocity .",
    "this time delay is the same reason responsible for the maximum thermal radio emission to be reached @xmath2years past optical maximum ( hjellming 1974 ) .",
    "the timings given in figure  14 correspond to @xmath81=0.85 and @xmath450.90 for tcp j18102829 - 2729590 and v3661 oph , respectively .",
    "this is close to what expected from eq.(4 ) for typical values of @xmath73 , @xmath80 and @xmath67 adopted in computing @xmath82 .",
    "the lightcurve of the two @xmath1-ray program novae , tcp j18102829 - 2729590 and asassn-16ma , is characterized by the distinct presence of two components , which are highlighted in figure  15 . the initial or _ fireball _ component produces a passage through maximum that is dependent on wavelength as described in the previous section .",
    "the second component appears at a later time and peaks simultaneously with the detection of the nova in @xmath1-rays ( for which reason we term it _ gamma _ ) and gives origin to a second maximum which is not wavelength dependent .",
    "the _ gamma _ component of the optical lightcurve behaves synchronously with the emission observed in @xmath1-rays . the preliminary analysis by li et al .",
    "( 2016 ) of the daily averaged @xmath1-ray behavior of asassn-16ma , shows a sudden detection coincident with peak flux on november 8 ( jd=2457700.5 ) followed by a general decline along the following nine days , with a significant 1-day @xmath1-ray flux dip observed on november 13 ( jd=2457705.5 ) .",
    "the _ gamma _ component of the optical lightcurve in figure  15 presents exactly the same behavior : a maximum on november 8 and a general decline for the following nine days with a 1-day brightness dip centered on november 13 .",
    "not only the shapes but also the flux ratios behaved in parallel .",
    "in fact , during the nine days of general decline , the @xmath1-ray flux changed by a factor of 3 , from 9.7 ( @xmath301.3 ) to 3.4 ( @xmath302.1 ) @xmath510@xmath83 ph @xmath40 s@xmath52 ( li et al .",
    "2016 ) , and over the same period of time the flux through the @xmath15-band also declined by a factor of 3 , from @xmath15=5.89 to @xmath15=7.02 .",
    "once the daily @xmath1-ray behavior of tcp j18102829 - 2729590 will become available , it will be interesting to explore if a similar degree of parallelism with the _ gamma _ component of its optical lightcurve was followed too .    as a further evidence of the link between the @xmath1-ray emission and the _ gamma _ component of the lightcurve",
    ", it is worth noticing that the reported mean @xmath1-ray flux of asassn-16ma ( li and chomiuk 2016 ) is 2.5@xmath5 higher than for tcp j18102829 - 2729590 ( li et al .",
    "well , the reddening corrected mean flux of the _ gamma _ component of the two novae in figure  15 is exactly in the same 2.5@xmath5 ratio , or @xmath84=5.19 and @xmath84=6.15 for asassn-16ma and tcp j18102829 - 2729590 , respectively .",
    "a difference of 2.5@xmath5 in the mean @xmath1-ray flux for the two program novae , both belonging to the bulge , seems to disprove the common belief ( eg .",
    "ackermann et al . 2014 ) , that ( @xmath6 ) the intrinsic @xmath1-ray brightness is similar among normal novae , ( @xmath7 ) they can be detected by fermi - lat over only limited distances from the sun , and therefore ( @xmath8 ) @xmath1-ray emission is a widespread ( if not general ) property of novae . judging from asassn-16ma and tcp j18102829 - 2729590 , it appears instead that novae can be firmly detected by fermi - lat up to and beyond the galactic bulge , and their intrinsic brightness in @xmath1-rays can differ greatly . combining this with the relatively low number of normal novae detected to date by fermi - lat ( 6 novae in total",
    "have been detected in @xmath1-rays , in contrast to the 69 discovered optically in the same period , cf morris et al .",
    "2017 ) , it is tempting to conclude that @xmath1-ray emission is _ not _ a wide - spread property for them .",
    "the two - component lightcurve here described for the program @xmath1-ray novae brings to mind the two - component ejecta adopted to model the radio - interferometric observations of some recent novae ( chomiuk et al .",
    "2014 , weston et al .",
    "2016 ) , a faster polar wind collides with a slower ( and pre - existing ? ) equatorial density enhancement .",
    "this scenario applies however to radio observations extending for months past the initial eruption . the second or _ gamma _",
    "component of the optical lightcurve of program @xmath1-ray novae develops instead within a few days of the initial _ fireball _ component , and could therefore trace something different in the kinematical and geometric arrangment of the ejecta .",
    "we postpone to a future paper a quantitative modeling of our two - component lightcurve for @xmath1-ray novae to include similar data for additional objects and therefore reinforce the statistics .",
    "at the position of the four program novae v2949 oph , v3661 oph , tcp j18102829 - 2729590 , and asassn-16ma no progenitor is visible in deep ogle @xmath4-band images or dss plates , which set the minimal outburst amplitudes listed in table  3 .",
    "for all of them , a progenitor containing a giant or a sub - giant companion , would have been brighter in @xmath85 band than the completeness limit of 2mass survey in the respective areas , suggesting their donor star is a dwarf . for the remaining three program novae ( v1534 sco , v1535 sco and master ot j010603.18 - 744715.8 ) a progenitor has been proposed based on positional coincidence with pre - outburst surveys .",

    "they have been transformed into the corresponding @xmath35 and @xmath89 following the relations calibrated by fiorucci & munari ( 2003 ) for m - type giants .",
    "the best fit to @xmath90 data in figure  16 is obtained with an m3iii for @xmath35=1.63 and an m1iii for @xmath35=1.95 .",
    "overall , the fit with the m3iii is somewhat better .",
    "this is minimally dependent on @xmath91 bands , while @xmath92 are far more relevant .",
    "the fit with the m3iii provides a distance of 8.2 kpc , while that with the m1iii drops down to 5.0 .",
    "considering the partnership of the nova with the bulge , we conclude that the progenitor of nova v1534 sco is well represented by an m3iii cool giant reddened by @xmath35=1.63 .",
    "the @xmath3 and @xmath15 points lie above both fit attempts in figure  16 .",
    "there are at least three suitable explanations for this : ( 1 ) the asymptotic @xmath3 and @xmath15 values are still influenced by emission from the nova ejecta , ( 2 ) the severe crowding which fooled the derivation in sect .",
    "4.2 of @xmath35 from nova photometry is affecting the @xmath3 and @xmath15 brightness of the progenitor too , and ( 3 ) ionization of the cool giant wind by the wd produces extra - flux at @xmath3 and @xmath15 wavelengths .",

    "this star is positionally concident to better than 0.1 arcsec with the nova , with a gaia data release 1 source of @xmath93=14.392 mag , and a denis counterpart with @xmath4=15.24 mag .    in figure  17",

    "the fit is clearly unsatisfactory at optical wavelengths , implying quite blue intrinsic colors for the progenitor . at the distance given in table  3 for the nova , the absolute magnitude of the progenitor would be m(k)=@xmath102.9 , which is that expected for a k3 - 4iii giant . such a classification was one of the alternatives ( the other being an m4 - 5iii ) considered by srivastava et al .",

    "<S> the @xmath0 lightcurves of seven recent novae have been extensively mapped with daily robotic observations from atacama ( chile ) . </S>",

    "<S> five belong to the bulge , one to smc and another is a galactic disk object . </S>",
    "<S> the two program novae detected in @xmath1-rays by fermi - lat ( tcp j1734475 - 240942 and asassn-16ma ) are bulge objects with unevolved companions . </S>",
    "<S> they distinguish themselves in showing a double - component optical lightcurve . </S>",
    "<S> the first component to develop is the _ fireball _ from freely - expanding , ballistic - launched ejecta with the time of passage through maximum which is strongly dependent on wavelength ( @xmath21 day delay between @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second component , emerging simultaneously with the nova detection in @xmath1-rays and for this reason termed _ gamma _ , evolves at a slower pace , its optical brightness being proportional to the @xmath1-ray flux , and its passage through maximum _ not _ dependent on wavelength . </S>",
    "<S> the fact that @xmath1-rays are detected from novae at the distance of the bulge and at peak flux levels differing by 4@xmath5 seems to contradict some common belief like : only normal novae close to the sun are detected by fermi - lat , most normal novae emit @xmath1-rays , and they emit @xmath1-rays in similar amounts . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages offered by high - quality photometric observations collected with only one telescope ( as opposed to data provided by a number of different instruments ) are discussed in connection to the actual local realization of the standard filter bandpasses and the spectrum of novae dominated by emission lines . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown how , for the program novae , such high - quality and _ single - telescope _ </S>",
    "<S> optical photometry is able to disentangle effects like : the wavelength dependence of a fireball expansion , the recombination in the flashed wind of a giant companion , the subtle presence of hiccups and plateaus , tracing the super - soft x - ray phase , and determining the time of its switch - off . </S>",
    "<S> the non - detection by 2mass of the progenitor excludes a giant or a sub - giant being present in four of the program novae ( v2949 oph , v3661 oph , tcp j18102829 - 2729590 , and asassn-16ma ) . for the remaining three objects , by modelling the optical - ir spectral energy in quiescence it is shown that v1534 sco contains an m3iii giant , v1535 sco a k - type giant , and master ot j010603.18 - 744715.8 a sub - giant .    </S>",
