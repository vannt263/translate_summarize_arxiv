    "symmetry , the statement that a string theory compactified on a circle of radius @xmath1 is isomorphic to a string compactified on a circle of radius @xmath2 , is the most basic instance of t - duality .",
    "it is not only a prime example of inherently `` stringy '' physics but also an extremely useful tool in studying the theory .",
    "it has been used to argue for the existence of `` minimal distances '' in string theory and , applied in more complicated situations , to derive various properties of the theory . in these applications",
    "it is often necessary to assume that t - duality is an exact symmetry of string theory .",
    "the justification of  symmetry comes from conformal field theory .",
    "probably the neatest argument is that if one looks at a conformal field theory corresponding to a string on a circle of radius @xmath1 , then at @xmath3 ( in suitable units ) one gets an extra @xmath4 symmetry which may be used to identify the marginal operator which decreases @xmath1 with the marginal operator which increases @xmath1 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in compactification on @xmath5",
    "the t - duality is extended to an @xmath6 symmetry acting on the volume and background @xmath7-field .",
    "the problem with the argument is that it ignores nonperturbative effects in the string coupling constant . in this paper",
    "we will show how nonperturbative effects can modify the conclusion when the string coupling is nonzero .",
    "our general conclusion is that t - duality - like arguments work generally only when there is a lot of supersymmetry . here",
    "we will look at the heterotic string compactified on a product of a k3 surface and a 2-torus leading to an @xmath8 theory in four dimensions .",
    "heterotic strings compactified on @xmath5 exhibit t - duality at any value of the string coupling , as we will show . at the level of conformal field theory",
    "the correlation functions factorize into products of correlators associated to one or the other factor of the compactification space , so the presence of k3 is irrelevant to the issue of t - duality for @xmath5 .",
    "we will show that this is not true nonperturbatively .",
    "the 2-torus in this context appears to be the most supersymmetric case for a failure of t - duality and so will be the easiest to analyze .    in many ways",
    "the essential facts of this paper have been known to many people for a few years now .",
    "that is , something peculiar happens to t - duality when a heterotic string is compactified on k3@xmath0 .",
    "this was studied in particular in @xcite for example .",
    "our purpose here is to emphasize that this implies a basic failure of t - duality in a general setting  a fact which does not appear to have been widely appreciated .",
    "we should immediately clarify precisely what we mean when we say that t - duality is `` broken '' .",
    "what we do _ not _ mean is that we consider the string theory on a circle of radius @xmath1 and then the same string theory on a circle of radius @xmath2 and discover that they are different .",
    "the situation is more awkward than this because it is difficult to say unambiguously how to measure the radius of a circle in this context .",
    "what we can describe unambiguously is the moduli space of heterotic string theories compactified on a given spacetime .",
    "we can then follow the philosophy developed in studying moduli spaces of  threefolds @xcite .",
    "we attempt to assign a `` geometrical '' interpretation in terms of parameters such as the sizes of circles to points in the moduli space .",
    "one begins with some large radius ( and/or weak coupling ) region where one understands the system classically and then one integrates along paths in the moduli space assigning parameters to all the points in the moduli space .",
    "the problem with this method is that monodromies within the moduli space force branch cuts to be made . in general",
    "one finds that this process requires choices , so that the parameters are not uniquely determined by the moduli .",
    "one may try to remove these monodromies by forming a teichmller space which will cover this moduli space .",
    "if all goes well then the new copies of the fundamental region will tessellate `` naturally '' to form a cover giving some parameter space .",
    "an example where this fails was first recognized for measuring the volume of the quintic threefold in @xcite ( see figure 5.2 of that paper in particular ) .",
    "it is important to note that one may always form the teichmller space and obtain an associated ( usually very large ) modular group .",
    "indeed this was the approach taken in @xcite for example and one may also obtain useful information about the theory if this path is taken ( see @xcite for example ) .",
    "the point we wish to emphasize here however is that this teichmller space is often physically meaningless in the usual sense .",
    "what conditions need to hold in order for a physical interpretation to survive ?",
    "in this paper we propose the following .",
    "the parameter space must contain a limiting `` semiclassical '' open region corresponding to weakly coupled strings and large radii .",
    "this region should be unique up to the action of duality transformations which can be determined from the semiclassical approximation to the system . in the case at hand",
    "this would mean that the large - radius , weak - coupling limit of a @xmath5 compactification must be unique up to @xmath9 .",
    "this requirement is quite restrictive as we shall see .",
    "we believe this is a very reasonable definition for t - duality to respect .",
    "one could not seriously propose that there is a symmetry in the universe which identifies a circle of radius 1 cm with a circle of radius 2 cm  we may use a ruler to measure the difference ! an important aspect of t - dualities",
    "is that large distances are unique .",
    "it is precisely this uniqueness which is lost if we allow an arbitrary cover of the moduli space to act as our teichmller space .",
    "we will endeavour to show that the moduli space for the 2-torus in the context above does not admit a covering with this property and so there is no t - duality group . note that  symmetry is not literally `` broken '' .",
    "instead what is true is that for @xmath1 of order one or smaller , there is no natural way to associate a `` size '' @xmath1 to a given point in moduli space . in particular , the statement of t - duality thus loses its content .",
    "the nonperturbative corrections responsible for modifying the structure of the moduli space and rendering it inconsistent with t - duality are presumably represented by fivebrane instantons wrapping the k3 as well as one of the cycles of the torus .",
    "we do not know at present how to compute these corrections explicitly .",
    "instead , we use a dual type iia description of the model . in this description ,",
    "the heterotic dilaton is mapped to a k \" ahler modulus and the corrections in question are generated by world - sheet instantons whose effect is readily computed by mirror symmetry .    in the context of this dual model",
    "the issue of t - duality breaking becomes that of _ fibre - wise duality_. the idea is that one has a  space , @xmath10 , which is an @xmath11-fibration for some fibre @xmath11 which is also a  space .",
    "if some duality statement is true for each @xmath11 can it be extended to a duality of @xmath10 ?",
    "in section [ s : k3 ] we give an example where it can and in section [ s : snap ] we give an example where it can not . by heterotic / type ii string duality",
    "the latter case implies a failure of t - duality .",
    "the essential difference between sections [ s : k3 ] and [ s : snap ] is that in former we show that we are required to fit a _",
    "finite _ number of fundamental domains of the moduli space into a part of the teichmller space with _",
    "infinite _ area while in the later case we would be required to fit an _",
    "infinite _ number of fundamental domains of the moduli space into a part of the teichmller space with _",
    "finite _ area .",
    "in section [ s : conc ] we will discuss the consequences of broken dualities .",
    "in particular we will set a general description of how dualities are natural only when there is a large amount of supersymmetry .",
    "we propose that the clearest interpretation of the results in this paper is that _ whether a circle respects t - duality in string theory depends on the context of the circle .",
    "_ we will also note the possibly alarming conclusion that the _ classical _ @xmath6 modular group of the moduli space of complex structures on a torus is also probably broken ( in the same sense ) .",
    "in this section we will deal with a type iia string compactified on a k3 surface which is an elliptic fibration with section .",
    "we wish to see that the @xmath6 symmetry of the elliptic fibre can be seen in the moduli space of the k3 surface .",
    "an f - theory argument shows that this is equivalent to saying that the @xmath6 t - duality acting on the moduli space of complexified khler forms is unaffected by the value of the complex structure modulus ( or , equally , the mirror of this statement ) .",
    "note that the heterotic dilaton in eight dimensions lives in a separate @xmath12 factor of the moduli space and will certainly not affect any t - duality statements .",
    "we know from narain @xcite that the moduli space required for a heterotic string on @xmath5 ( with the wilson lines switched off ) is @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the usual hyperbolic lattice of signature @xmath16",
    ". this space can be thought of as the grassmannian of space - like 2-planes in @xmath17 where we care only about the orientation of the 2-planes relative to the lattice @xmath18 .",
    "one may explicitly map @xmath19 to @xmath20 by writing a vector @xmath21 in @xmath17 as @xmath22 and then let @xmath23 act on this vector as @xmath24 ( note that @xmath25 maps to the identity . )    this allows us to rewrite @xmath26 in ( [ eq : m0 ] ) in terms of two copies of the upper - half plane @xmath27 .",
    "the modular group @xmath28 then generates two copies of @xmath6  each acting on its upper - half plane , a `` mirror '' @xmath29 which exchanges the upper - half planes , and a `` conjugation '' @xmath29 which acts as ( minus ) complex conjugation on both upper - half planes simultaneously .",
    "one can then interpret one upper - half plane as representing the complex structure , @xmath30 , of the 2-torus and the other upper - half plane as representing the @xmath7-field and khler form , @xmath31 , of the torus @xcite .",
    "equivalently we may describe this moduli space as two copies of the @xmath32-line divided by exchange and complex conjugation .",
    "we denote coordinates on the two @xmath32-lines by @xmath33 and @xmath34 .    via the usual f - theory argument",
    "@xcite the heterotic string on @xmath5 is dual to f - theory ( or the type iia string in some limit ) on a k3 surface , @xmath35 .",
    "identification problem which we will ignore for the sake of exposition .",
    "the complex conjugation symmetry of @xmath26 must be treated carefully in the type iia picture .",
    "we will ignore this subtlety for the sake of exposition .",
    "] we will map the moduli space explicitly for the case of an algebraic k3 surface written as a hypersurface in a toric variety .",
    "let us consider the surface @xmath36 given by @xmath37 in @xmath38 , where we divide by the @xmath39 action generated by @xmath40 .",
    ", do nt forget that the weighted projective identification means that @xmath41 .",
    "] this k3 surface is mirror via the usual arguments @xcite to an elliptic k3 surface with a section .",
    "that is , @xmath35 and @xmath42 are a mirror pair in the sense of algebraic k3 surfaces @xcite",
    ". we should now be able to map out the desired moduli space , @xmath26 by varying @xmath43 and @xmath44 in ( [ eq : k3a ] ) , i.e. , by varying the complex structure of @xmath42 .",
    "we want to explicitly map the coordinates @xmath45 to the two copies of the @xmath32-line we saw above . this has already been done in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "let us review this construction so that we may compare some details to that of the  threefold in the next section .",
    "the structure is most easily seen by finding the `` interesting '' points in the moduli space . as is well - known , at certain points in the moduli space we obtain enhanced gauge symmetries . in the language of the grassmannian ( [ eq : m0 ] ) this occurs when lattice elements of length squared @xmath46 are orthogonal to the space - like 2-plane .",
    "let us suppose that we force the 2-plane to be orthogonal to such a lattice element .",
    "the result is that the 2-plane now varies in the space @xmath47 , where @xmath48 and @xmath49 is a one - dimensional lattice whose generator has length squared @xmath50 .",
    "that is , the moduli space within @xmath26 where the theory has a gauge symmetry of at least @xmath4 is given by @xmath51 in the same way that @xmath20 is mapped to @xmath19 , we may map @xmath52 to @xmath53 by writing @xmath54 and letting @xmath55 act as @xmath56 the reader may also check that ( up to a @xmath29 corresponding to complex conjugation ) @xmath57 .    thus we may embed @xmath58 into @xmath26 by setting @xmath59 . in other words @xmath60 in terms of the two @xmath32-lines .",
    "actually the fact that @xmath28 acts _ transitively _ on vectors of length squared @xmath46 shows that we have an enhanced gauge symmetry ( of at least @xmath4 ) if _ and only if _ @xmath60 .    in terms of @xmath42 in the form ( [ eq : k3a ] )",
    "we have an enhanced gauge symmetry when @xmath44 and @xmath43 are tuned to produce a canonical singularity .",
    "this happens when the discriminant , @xmath61 , of the equation vanishes .",
    "this is given by plane .",
    "this discriminant does not really have four components . ]",
    "@xmath62 one may also argue that @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is some constant , as follows . as we said above",
    "we only get enhanced gauge symmetry when @xmath60 .",
    "one argues that the power is 2 by saying that any odd power would violate the @xmath65 symmetry and any power higher than 2 would imply that the degeneration of @xmath42 when @xmath66 could never be suitably generic .",
    "we also have further enhanced gauge symmetry .",
    "namely there is a single point @xmath67 where we have @xmath68 and a single point @xmath69 where we have @xmath70 . with a bit of algebra",
    "we may find the corresponding values for @xmath44 and @xmath43 .",
    "all said , our equations are satisfied with @xmath71 by making @xmath33 and @xmath34 the roots of @xmath72    if the reader is not fully convinced of this map between @xmath45 and the @xmath32-lines , one may check that the `` flatness '' condition is satisfied for the `` special coordinates '' @xmath73 and @xmath30 .",
    "we will do this next .",
    "for a nice account of what is meant by `` special coordinates ''",
    "we refer to @xcite .",
    "the special coordinates are of particular interest to us because these specify `` length '' are should parameterize any natural teichmller space .",
    "let us perform the usual analysis of converting `` algebraic coordinates '' @xmath45 into special , or flat coordinates as in @xcite .",
    "this is a rather technical process but it is thoroughly treated in the literature .",
    "our approach is closest to @xcite . introducing variables",
    "@xmath74 we obtain the hypergeometric partial differential operators # 1#1 @xmath75 the monomial - divisor mirror map of @xcite tells us that @xmath35 is an elliptic fibration with a section and that the section goes to infinite size as @xmath76 and the fibre goes to infinite size as @xmath77 .",
    "there is a unique solution of @xmath78 which is equal to 1 at the origin .",
    "call this @xmath79 .",
    "we also have solutions @xmath80 and @xmath81 which behave asymptotically as @xmath82 and @xmath83 as we approach the origin .",
    "the flat coordinates are then ratios of these solutions in the usual way .",
    "let us put @xmath84 ( just as @xmath85 is used conventionally to denote @xmath86 . )",
    "we then have a power series solution from the hypergeometric system : @xmath87 explicit computation then shows order by order that this is consistent with ( [ eq : j1 ] ) with @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the usual @xmath32-function expansion given by @xmath90 .",
    "this verifies that ( [ eq : j1 ] ) is correct .",
    "see @xcite for an explicit proof of this .",
    "now we wish to analyze the same two parameter model from the point of view of the elliptic fibration of the k3 surface @xmath35 .",
    "we want to know if @xmath6 modular group of the elliptic fibre can be seen in the moduli space of @xmath35 .",
    "first let us take the area of section to be huge , @xmath76 . in this limit ,",
    "the moduli properties of @xmath35 are basically that of its fibre .",
    "putting @xmath91 we obtain @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "it is very important to note that varying @xmath94 gives us a _",
    "double _ cover of the @xmath33-line .",
    "in particular , if we plot the shape of fundamental region in terms of flat coordinates ( as discussed in @xcite ) we obtain the shaded area of figure [ fig : g2 ] .",
    "this region is @xmath95 , where @xmath96 is the upper - half plane .",
    "this means that there is a non - toric @xmath29 symmetry acting on @xmath42 which will identify the two fundamental regions of @xmath97 in figure [ fig : g2 ] .    in terms of the mirror @xmath42",
    ", taking @xmath76 takes @xmath98 .",
    "@xmath42 is an elliptic k3 surface with a section and in this limit the complex structure of the fibre becomes constant .",
    "the remaining variation of complex structure of @xmath42 is therefore the variation of the complex structure of this constant fibre .",
    "a similar story was was discussed in @xcite .",
    "finding the moduli space of an elliptic curve via toric varieties is always going to be plagued by finding multiple covers of the @xmath32-line because of non - toric symmetries .",
    "most simple families of elliptic curves that one tries to write down tend to have fixed rational points .",
    "see @xcite for a discussion of such problems .",
    "this `` level structure '' forces the nave moduli space to be a multiple cover of the @xmath32-line .",
    "this helps us out in the toric case as we now explain .    in the general approach of candelas",
    "@xcite in analyzing a one parameter case , the moduli space will always look like a rational curve with 3 special points . to use the language of the quintic threefold",
    ", one point will be `` large complex structure '' another will be an orbifold - like point and a third , which marks the division between the first two phases , is a `` conifold''-like point .",
    "the problem is that an elliptic curve does nt have a conifold - like point  any singular complex structure must be the large complex structure . thus one must have a non - toric symmetry identifying the putative conifold point with the large complex structure point . in our example",
    "this must identify the `` conifold '' @xmath99 with @xmath100 , i.e. , it is the @xmath101 symmetry .",
    "it is this non - toric discrete symmetry which produces the multiple cover of the @xmath32-line above .",
    "now the main question we wish to ask is what happens to figure [ fig : g2 ] if we allow @xmath102 to be nonzero ? from ( [ eq : j1z ] ) the point given by @xmath99 in figure [ fig : g2 ] corresponds to @xmath103 .",
    "this is on the discriminant as it corresponds to @xmath104 . for general @xmath102 ,",
    "the relevant part of the discriminant becomes @xmath105 thus , as @xmath102 is switched on , the point @xmath103 splits into two nearby points ( up to extra identifications ) .",
    "how can we understand this in terms of flat coordinates ?",
    "the question of what a slice of constant @xmath102 in the moduli space corresponds to in terms of the elliptic curve is awkward .",
    "recall that setting @xmath91 put @xmath93 and so @xmath106 .",
    "suppose instead we fix @xmath73 to be @xmath107 for some large but finite @xmath108 .",
    "what does the fundamental region for @xmath30 then look like ? because of the mirror map @xmath109 , we are free to fix @xmath110 .",
    "this `` chops off '' the top of the fundamental region .",
    "this will turn figure [ fig : g2 ] into figure [ fig : g2a ] .    now",
    "the domain for @xmath102 constant , as opposed to @xmath34 constant , wo nt quite look like figure [ fig : g2a ] but the coarse structure should be about right .",
    "thus we see how the point at the end of the cusp at @xmath99 in figure [ fig : g2 ] gets split and moves up a little in figure [ fig : g2a ] .",
    "( we should also point out that these supposed two points are actually identified by the @xmath6 action in figure [ fig : g2a ] . )",
    "when @xmath102 is nonzero , a solution of @xmath94 satisfying ( [ eq : dc1 ] ) gives a @xmath29-orbifold point on @xmath35 .",
    "thus this corresponds to an @xmath4 gauge symmetry ( in the eight - dimensional theory in question ) and this point in the moduli space is a @xmath29 orbifold point .",
    "the important point is that _ nothing catastrophic happens to the @xmath6 action as we switch on @xmath102_. we just pick up an extra @xmath29 into the modular group . we know that our moduli space is of the form of a global quotient ( [ eq : m0 ] ) and so no matter what kind of complex slice of the moduli space we take , we will always see some t - duality group acting nicely on some slice of the teichmller space . in the heterotic string point of view , the t - duality group of the torus persists .",
    "we now wish to discuss along parallel lines the case of a heterotic string compactified on k3@xmath0 . to this end , we need to replace the k3 surface @xmath35 with a  threefold @xmath10 .",
    "the space @xmath10 is now a k3-fibration .",
    "the fibre has a t - duality which can be shown to be @xmath6 ( which up to @xmath29 factors is @xmath111  the full t - duality group of a k3 surface ) .",
    "this @xmath6 will not survive to the full  threefold moduli space .",
    "this shows that the t - duality of the heterotic string is destroyed at nonzero string coupling",
    ".    the toric data for @xmath10 will be very similar to that of @xmath35 , and @xmath10 will again have two deformations of the @xmath7-field and khler form .",
    "let @xmath112 be given by @xmath113 in @xmath114 , where we divide by the @xmath115 action generated by @xmath116 this  threefold and its mirror @xmath10 have been studied extensively @xcite . in particular kachru and vafa",
    "@xcite conjectured that the type iia string on @xmath10 is dual to the heterotic string on @xmath117 where @xmath118 is a k3 surface and @xmath119 is an elliptic curve .",
    "the string theory on @xmath119 is frozen along @xmath120 by higgsing the enhanced @xmath4 symmetry we saw in the last section .",
    "thus the moduli space of the string on @xmath119 should be just a single copy of the @xmath32-line .",
    "there is considerable evidence to support this conjecture ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "now as before we may introduce @xmath74 and we obtain the hypergeometric partial differential operators # 1#1 @xmath121 again the monomial - divisor mirror map of @xcite tells us that @xmath10 is a k3 fibration with a section and that the section goes to infinite size as @xmath76 and the k3 fibre goes to infinite size as @xmath77 .",
    "note that this hypergeometric system is remarkably similar to the elliptic fibration in the previous section ( [ eq : hs2 ] ) .",
    "we may find the flat coordinates as before , the exponentials of which we will call @xmath122 and @xmath123 again .",

    "this @xmath129 is a subgroup of the @xmath127 by which we are going to orbifold .",
    "that is , the sextic curve is mapped to a cubic  i.e. , an elliptic curve .",
    "thus the moduli space of the k3 surface can be mapped to the moduli space of an elliptic curve .",
    "a little work is involved in showing that there is no level structure implicit on this elliptic curve and so one indeed gets one copy of the @xmath32-line as desired .",
    "the heterotic interpretation of the flat coordinates corresponding to @xmath122 and @xmath123 are the single complex modulus of the torus and the dilaton - axion respectively @xcite .",
    "indeed , the appearance of the @xmath32-line above as @xmath76 shows that , in this limit we do indeed get the correct moduli space for the torus  @xmath97 . in this way we see that the t - duality of the heterotic string on a torus at zero coupling is reproduced in the type - iia dual .",
    "now what happens when we allow @xmath102 to be nonzero ?",
    "although the hypergeometric system ( [ eq : hs3 ] ) is similar at first sight to that of the previous section ( [ eq : hs2 ] ) , there is a drastic difference .",
    "let us consider the behaviour of the discriminant locus in a constant @xmath102 slice as @xmath102 is near zero .",

    "the single point @xmath91 , @xmath133 is the classical limit corresponding to an @xmath4 enhanced gauge symmetry and the two points for constant @xmath136 are the points giving the massless solitons .",
    "the important result we wish to borrow from seiberg - witten theory is that in flat coordinates the monodromy around either of these two points alone is _ infinite_. the monodromy within the curve @xmath91 around both points together is @xmath29  as we see from the @xmath91 limit .. see @xcite . ]",
    "the situation here contrasted with that of the previous section can be summed up as follows    * for the moduli space of @xmath35 we have a point at @xmath91 around which the monodromy is infinite . as @xmath102",

    "this can all be traced back to the fact that for @xmath35 , @xmath91 gave a double cover of the @xmath32-line while for @xmath10 it gives a single cover .",
    "we now wish to claim that this behaviour for @xmath10 makes it completely impossible to maintain any notion of t - duality when @xmath102 is switched on . that is t - duality for the heterotic string",

    "suppose we let @xmath102 be small but nonzero .",
    "this should correspond to the weakly - coupled heterotic string .",
    "the moduli space for the @xmath5 part must look `` almost '' like the classical fundamental region for @xmath97 . by `` almost '' we mean that no points in the moduli space for @xmath5 can have moved a large distance with respect to the special khler metric relative to the @xmath91 slice . we should now ask whether we can apply @xmath6 to this new moduli space to form a nice tessellated cover of the upper half plane just as we could for @xmath91 .",
    "note in particular the the angle of any corner of the moduli space must correspond to the monodromy in the levi - civita connection of the special khler metric around that point in order that such a tessellation works .    in the case of @xmath10",
    "this correspondence fails .",
    "we show schematically what happens as @xmath102 is switched on in figure [ fig : ug ] . near the edge of the moduli space labelled by @xmath137",
    "we need to continue into a new fundamental region .",
    "this region must be distinct from that obtained by @xmath138 ( otherwise there would be no monodromy around the dots labelling the discriminant ) .",
    "clearly this is impossible without moving off onto a infinitely - sheeted cover of the upper - half plane .",
    "note that one might want to extend the idea of duality by following the route of building an infinite - sheet covering .",
    "indeed this was the idea behind such duality groups as those proposed in @xcite for example .",
    "one is certainly free do this mathematically and such a model might have many uses . what is unclear",
    "however is the physical significance of the huge teichmller space one builds by this process .",
    "it is certainly a considerable departure for the usual meaning of t - duality or u - duality .",
    "if we want to have a meaningful teichmller space then we should insist that we have a unique idea of an object at large radius and weak string coupling .",
    "this forces us to cover our moduli space with only one copy of a plane .",
    "we will demand this for our notion of duality .    the essential difference between this section where t - duality is broken and the previous section where t - duality was exact is as follows . in the unbroken case we introduced new copies of the fundamental region close to the horizontal axis `` @xmath139 '' when we switched on the coupling in figure  [ fig : g2a ] . in this section",
    "we had to attempt to add new regions near the point @xmath140 .",
    "the metric diverges near @xmath139 allowing room for new regions .",
    "new regions can not be fitted in near @xmath140 where the metric is finite .",
    "we have also seen explicitly how the argument for t - duality using the enhanced gauge symmetry fails in this case .",
    "the weyl symmetry of @xmath4 was used to relate the deformations increasing and decreasing @xmath1 from its value at the point of enhanced symmetry .",
    "in fact , the symmetry is never restored , and near the origin the monodromies about the two singularities that do appear render any attempt to consistently define the weyl - noninvariant coordinate ( @xmath141 in @xcite ) futile .",
    "one my try to forge a general setting for t - duality ( and s - duality and u - duality ) as follows .",
    "one wants to begin with a general smooth teichmller space , @xmath142 , which parameterizes familiar concepts such as length , coupling constants , etc .",
    "one then wants the moduli space to look like @xmath143 for some discrete duality group @xmath144 .",
    "in particular this means that any orbifold point in @xmath145 is a _ global _ orbifold point .",
    "that is , there is a global cover which removes this singularity .",
    "orbifold points in a moduli space need not be global .",
    "we would like to consider the appearance of local orbifold points as an obstruction to duality groups .",
    "of course one may want to declare in such a case that the covering @xmath142 itself has the orbifold point .",
    "one is free to do this and one ends up with a weaker notion of duality groups . in a typical case",
    "however this weak duality group will probably be trivial and so this is not a particularly useful notion . for duality we will insist that _ all _ orbifold points are global and @xmath142 is smooth .",
    "thanks to the berger - simons theorem ( see for example chapter 10 of @xcite ) knowing the holonomy of a manifold can lead a considerable knowledge of its structure . if the holonomy ( on the levi - civita connection ) and its representation on the tangent bundle is of a certain type then the manifold must be a symmetric space .",
    "we will call such a holonomy `` rigid '' .",
    "if the holonomy is `` non - rigid '' then the manifold is of type general riemannian , complex khler , hyperkhler , etc . by using the homogeneous structure of the symmetric spaces one may argue the following by tracing geodesics .",
    "if a geodesically complete orbifold has a rigid holonomy then it is globally a quotient of a symmetric space .",
    "note that in lower dimensions , a sufficiently extended supersymmetry forces a rigid holonomy group .",
    "the proposition tells us immediately that we should expect duality groups to appear for a large number of supersymmetries .",
    "for example for a type iia string on a k3 surface we have @xmath8 supersymmetry in six dimensions giving an @xmath1 symmetry of @xmath146 ( up to discrete groups ) .",
    "given the dimension of the moduli space this has rigid holonomy @xcite and so we see a teichmller space in the form of a symmetric space and a t - duality group ( or more generally a u - duality group ) .",
    "the same is not true for an @xmath8 theory in four dimensions however . here",
    "the holonomy of the moduli space only dictates that it be the product of a khler manifold and a quaternionic khler manifold .",
    "this non - rigid case should not be expected to have a duality group .",
    "this is the case of a heterotic string on k3@xmath0 .",
    "this classification breaks down a little in higher dimensions .",
    "this happens because symmetric spaces can sometimes have a holonomy ( and representation ) which appears to be non - rigid .",
    "for example , the heterotic string on a 2-torus alone is an @xmath147 theory in eight dimensions which has an @xmath1 symmetry @xmath148 .",
    "this tells us only that the moduli space is khler and so would not in itself predict a t - duality group .",
    "nevertheless the moduli space here is a quotient of a symmetric space .",
    "this shows that the holonomy can only tell us when we _ must _ have a duality group rather than when we can not .",
    "it seems reasonable however in lower dimensions where this ambiguity does not exist that a generic compactification leading to non - rigid holonomy will have no t - duality .",
    "the computation of section [ s : snap ] shows this is the case at least for one example .",
    "we have shown that when one considers a heterotic string compactified on k3@xmath0 in a particular way then the factor of the moduli space relevant to the torus is _ not _ a quotient of a physically meaningful smooth space of parameters by some t - duality group .",
    "in particular it is a completely meaningless statement to say that there is some kind of  symmetry on the circles within this torus . for a nonzero value of the string coupling constant",
    "the torus ( and therefore circle ) obeys a t - duality relationship no more than a generic  threefold .",
    "the meaninglessness of t - duality for s was discussed in @xcite .",
    "all one may do is to begin labelling points in the moduli space with size values near the large radius limit and then extend this process over the entire moduli space .",
    "this will usually lead to a minimum `` size '' .",
    "no real meaning can be attached to sizes below this value .",
    "the question that immediately raises itself is the following . _",
    "if t - duality fails for the heterotic string on k3@xmath0 then does it also fail for a circle itself ? _ one might argue that if the string on a circle of radius @xmath1 is exactly the same thing as a string on a circle of radius @xmath2 then further compactification on k3@xmath149 should also yield identical physics .",
    "this leads to three possibilities :    1 .   _",
    "t - duality fails for the string on a circle . _",
    "that is , symmetry is totally wrong when all nonperturbative corrections are taken into account .",
    "this would seem to be unlikely . for a string on a single circle at its self - dual radius",
    "we really see an unbroken @xmath4 gauge symmetry signaling an identification in the moduli space .",
    "this @xmath4 is broken by quantum effects when we consider k3@xmath0 .",
    "the holonomy arguments above also show that a lot of supersymmetry implies t - duality .",
    "we suggest therefore that t - duality is a symmetry for a string on a circle by itself .",
    "heterotic / type ii duality is wrong .",
    "_ if we really want t - duality to be respected exactly by all strings then we need to sacrifice the duality we used in this paper .",
    "one is free to do this .",
    "we do not know enough about string theory to `` prove '' heterotic / type ii duality .",
    "if one really is wedded to the idea of t - duality then this is a sacrifice one might be willing to make .",
    "3 .   _ a string does nt know about its compactifications .",
    "_ when one says that one understands some string theory compactified on some space , does this understanding ever include further compactification ?",
    "such a further compactification includes putting different boundary conditions on fields which had lived in flat space .",
    "in particular one may break supersymmetry .",
    "the above reasoning that  symmetry on a circle implies t - duality for further compactification is wrong .",
    "the last possibility would appear to be the most reasonable .",
    "it implies that  symmetry of a circle _ depends on the context of the circle . _ any argument which uses t - duality for a circle or torus embedded in some more complicated situation can not necessarily be considered rigorous .    in this paper",
    "we have considered the kachru ",
    "vafa example of the heterotic string compactified on a torus stuck at `` @xmath150 '' .",
    "this allowed us to consider just a two - parameter family of  threefolds  one remaining parameter for the torus and the string coupling .",
    "our failure to see an @xmath6 modular group can therefore be viewed just as much as failure of the _ classical @xmath6 modular group _ as of t - duality .",
    "what one should do is to go to the three parameter example of @xcite so that we may disentangle the @xmath73 and @xmath30 parameters of the 2-torus .",
    "the essential computation was again done in @xcite .",
    "the coarse result of this is that the moduli space does not respect _ any _ @xmath6 symmetry generically .",
    "this is perhaps a good deal more shocking at first sight than breaking t - duality .",
    "are we really saying that string theory breaks the classical modular invariance of a torus ?",
    "in other words string theory does not respect diffeomorphism invariance of the target space !    this is unavoidable if one wants to maintain heterotic / type ii duality .",
    "actually this possibility is not as bad as it might first appear upon reflection .",
    "one is used to the idea from conformal field theory at weak string coupling that quantum geometry may effect the structure of the moduli space of complexified khler form but that the complex structure moduli space is unchanged .",
    "now we claim that string coupling effects may also lead to quantum corrections to the moduli space of complex structures .",
    "this is quite reasonable in the current context as once string corrections have been taken into account the moduli space of the 2-torus does not even factorize exactly into khler form and complex structure parts .",
    "note also that the parts of the moduli space whose shape is most effected by the corrections are those close to where the enhanced gauge symmetry appeared in the weak coupling limit .",
    "these must involve circles in the torus approaching the string scale .",
    "thus it is still distances at the string scale in some sense which are most affected by quantum effects .",
    "again we should emphasize is that we are not really saying that a string on a certain torus is different to a string on the torus having undergone a modular transform .",
    "rather we are saying that once the string coupling is not zero , the moduli space of is no longer of the form @xmath97 .",
    "the meaning of what is it to go outside the fundamental region then becomes unclear .",
    "finally we note that all of the results in this paper have tied to dualities of the heterotic string .",
    "one might wish the type ii string to escape such effects .",
    "this appears to be unlikely .",
    "our holonomy argument of section [ ss : hol ] would seem to imply that a generic compactification with little supersymmetry should not obey any t - duality or u - duality laws .",
    "what is true however is that the type iia string has more supersymmetry to begin with .",
    "thus we know that t - duality for the type iia string k3@xmath0 _ is _ exact ( see , for example , @xcite for a discussion of this ) . what one might question however is whether the same is true for the type ii string on @xmath151 where @xmath152 is a generic  threefold .",
    "it is a pleasure to thank p.  argyres , r.  bryant , s. kachru , j.  harvey , g.  moore , d.  morrison , e.  sharpe and e.  silverstein for useful discussions ."
