    "structure functions are useful tools to understand the structure of hadrons . at large @xmath1 ,",
    "they are related to parton distributions .",
    "although their @xmath1-evolution is consistent with perturbative qcd , their bulk properties come from nonperturbative effects .",
    "the latter are often treated by low - energy models , such as njl , which establish a connection whith the low @xmath1 physics .",
    "an extensive work has been done during the last years along these lines  @xcite .",
    "the interest has turned to off - diagonal structure functions .",
    "the latter appear as convolutions of generalized parton distributions , which , in some way , carry information about correlations between partons .",
    "they can be related to the off - forward @xmath2-hadron amplitude . in order to illustrate the properties of these quantities",
    ", we undertook to calculate them in the simple case of the pion . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we first calculated the forward amplitude and the quark distribution in a simple model .",
    "we considered that the pion field is coupled to ( constituent ) quark fields through a simple @xmath3 vertex .",
    "furthermore , we introduced the effects of the pion size through a gauge - invariant procedure by requiring that the squared relative momentum of the quarks inside the pion is smaller than a cut - off value .",
    "the most remarkable result of this investigation is that the momentum fraction carried by the quarks is smaller than one , although gluonic degrees of freedom are not included . here",
    ", we report on the extension of our model to the off - diagonal case .",
    "we adopt the kinematics shown in fig .  [ f1 ] .",
    "we will use the lorentz invariants @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 . the diagonal limit is characterised by @xmath9 and the elastic limit by @xmath10",
    ".    the hadronic tensor @xmath11 can be written , for a scalar or pseudoscalar target , as  @xcite @xmath12 current conservation is guarenteed by means of the projector @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the momenta of the incoming and outgoing photons , respectively .",
    "the structure functions @xmath16 are functions of the invariant quantities @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "they are all even functions of @xmath18 , except for @xmath20 , which is odd .",
    "the model introduced in our previous work  @xcite includes massive pion and massive quark fields and a pion - quark coupling described by the following lagrangian interaction density @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the quark field , @xmath23 is the pion field and @xmath24 is the isospin operator .    at leading order in the loop expansion , four diagrams contribute .",
    "they are displayed in fig .",
    "we have evaluated their imaginary part , using the integration variables @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the polar angles of @xmath29 with respect to the direction of the incoming photon . actually , due to the discontinuity of the diagrams , indicated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , the integration bears on @xmath30 and @xmath27 only .",
    "we do not give the expressions here .",
    "they can be found in ref .",
    "however , we can sketch our procedure for imposing a finite size to the pion .",
    "the relative four - momentum squared of the quarks inside the pion is given by    @xmath31    for pion - quark vertices like the ones in the first diagram of fig .",
    "[ f1 ] . note that this can be rewritten as @xmath32 the first quantity in the r.h.s .",
    "being nothing but the squared momentum transfer for the @xmath33 process , @xmath34 can be written as function of the external variables for this process and of the masses .",
    "similar expressions hold for other vertices . generalizing the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite , we require @xmath35 either for one or the other vertex of each diagram",
    ". gauge invariance is therefore preserved by this cut - off , as it can be thought of as a constraint on the intermediate state cut lines . in practice , this is equivalent to requiring one of the two following conditions : @xmath36 as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , owing to these conditions and for small @xmath19 , the crossed diagrams are suppressed by a power @xmath37 , compared to the box diagrams .",
    "we keep the coupling constant @xmath38 as in the diagonal case , where it was determined by imposing that there are only two constituent quarks in the pion , or equivalently that the following relation @xmath39 holds , which makes @xmath38 dependent upon @xmath1 .",
    "it turns out that , with the cut - off , @xmath38 reaches an asymptotic value for @xmath1 above 2 gev@xmath40 .",
    "we will use this value below .",
    "we investigated the main properties of the structure functions @xmath16 in many different domains of the parameters .",
    "we can not give an overview of the results here .",
    "we will instead concentrate on two particular results , namely the behaviour at high @xmath1 and the momentum sum rule .",
    "the results presented below pertain to the chiral limit ( @xmath41=0 ) . they have been obtained with the same cut - off value as in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely @xmath42= 0.75 gev , a value consistent with the hard core radius of the pion in the chiral bag model  @xcite .",
    "expanding the ratios @xmath43,@xmath44,@xmath45,@xmath46 , we obtain the following asymptotic behaviours : @xmath47 the first relation is similar ( at leading order in @xmath48 and with the replacement of @xmath17 by @xmath49 ) to the callan - gross relation between the diagonal structure functions @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "except for @xmath52 , which is small at large @xmath1 , these relations show that @xmath51 , @xmath20 and @xmath53 are simply related to @xmath50 at leading order .",
    "they are consistent with the parity of these functions with respect to @xmath18 .",
    "they constitute a remarkable result of our model .",
    "furthermore , we checked that the term @xmath54 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : gcg1 ] ) is numerically quite small , even for moderate @xmath1 .",
    "one may wonder whether these properties are typical of our model or more general .",
    "we recall that , for the diagonal case ( elastic scattering in the forward direction ) , we found in ref .",
    "@xcite that the momentum fraction carried by the quarks @xmath55 has a rather low value , @xmath560.6 , independently of @xmath1 ( as long as it is larger than @xmath57 2 gev@xmath40 ) .",
    "the quantity 2@xmath58 moves slowly to unity when the cut - off is removed , showing that the low value mentioned above is due to finite size effects .",
    "we investigated how this property evolves when going to the off - forward case .",
    "some results are given in fig .",
    "[ f2 ] for the elastic case ( @xmath18=0 ) .",
    "one can see that 2@xmath58 increases when @xmath59 increases : the quantity which measures the momentum fraction carried by the quarks in the diagonal case and probed by the process increases with the momentum transfer . strictly speaking @xmath60 is not the quark momentum distribution for @xmath610 . by continuity",
    ", it is expected to keep this property for small values of this variable .",
    "this point however deserves further investigation .     with respect to the @xmath50 distribution , as function of @xmath1 , for various values of @xmath19 , in the elastic case .",
    ", height=188 ]      we have also obtained many other results . it is not the place to discuss them in detail .",
    "let us just mention that we analysed the twist decomposition of the @xmath16 s and worked out the twist-2 @xmath62 and twist-3 @xmath63 , @xmath64 contributions , as defined in ref .",
    "we found that the twist-3 contributions are not suppressed at large @xmath1 .",
    "this is a remarkable and somewhat unexpected result of our model .",
    "we have extended our previous model for the pion to investigate the off - diagonal structure functions .",
    "we recall the two main results of our previous investigation .",
    "first , the introduction of a cut - off forces the crossed diagrams to behave as higher - twists and to relate the imaginary part of the forward amplitude with quark distributions .",
    "second , the pion size effects , embodied by the cut - off , do not allow the fullfillment of the momentum sum rule ( @xmath65 ) at infinite @xmath1 .",
    "physically , this corresponds to the fact that the quarks can never be considered as free .",
    "we found that these characteristics are qualitatively preserved when going off - forward , at least for small or moderate excursions off the forward case .",
    "our results rest on the analysis of the imaginary part of the amplitude only .",
    "however , in this regime at least , the introduction of the real part , which can be obtained via dispersion relations ( up to a subtaction constant ) , is not expected to bring drastic changes .",
    "our investigation yields interesting and somehow unexpected results .",
    "in particular , we singled out generalized callan - gross relations ( eqs.9 - 11 ) , which link the @xmath16 s in a simple manner at leading order in @xmath48 .",
    "more intriguing are the twist - three structure functions , that do not scale as a power of @xmath66 . at this point of our investigation , we are not able to state whether these properties are typical of our model or are more general",
    ". in particular , it would be interesting to know how these results are affected when turning to the full amplitude .",
