    "at a future linear @xmath0 collider the possibility of using compton backscattered photons off the highly energetic and polarized incident electron beams @xcite can be used for many interesting physics applications .",
    "important examples include the study of anomalous vector boson couplings through the large @xmath1 cross section , the search for heavy higgs bosons up to @xmath7 ( compared to @xmath8 in the @xmath0 mode ) , the cp - properties of fundamental scalars and the partial @xmath9 width ( and thus the total higgs - width assuming a knowledge of br@xmath10 from the lhc for instance ) .",
    "in addition one has the unique chance to study the polarized photon structure , complimentary processes involving supersymmetric particles ( if they exist ) at comparable event rates and , more exoticly , can even study theories predicting new dimensions at the tev scale through kaluzza - klein excitations .    the main physics motivation of a future linear collider is not as much the discovery of new physics but its clarification . in analogous ways",
    "as slc / lep results have made precision tests of the sm after the discovery of massive vector bosons in hadronic collisions , the principle motivation for a linear collider is based on the hope that precise measurements of processes at the electroweak scale can shed light on the deeper structure of physical laws up to much higher energies , possibly gut scales or evens regimes where the gravitational coupling becomes comparable to the other gauge couplings .    in this context",
    "the partial @xmath2 stands out as an observable of considerable theoretical and experimental importance . for intermediate mass higgs bosons below 140 gev",
    "it is the only decay channel accessible at the lhc as a relatively background free process @xcite . at the compton",
    "backscattered @xmath3 option of the linear @xmath0 collider it represents the production process of a fundamental scalar .",
    "all charged particles contribute in the loop and heavy states which obtain their mass through the higgs mechanism do nt decouple due to the yukawa coupling at the vertex .",
    "[ fig : ggh ] depicts the sm contributions from @xmath1 bosons and t - and b - quarks . in 2-higgs doublet models ( 2hdm ) , such as in the higgs sector of the mssm",
    ", there are five fundamental scalars .",
    "the additional supersymmetry of the mssm leads to only two free parameters of the electroweak braking sector , commonly chosen as the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the up- and down - type higgs bosons , @xmath4 , and the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs boson , @xmath11 . at tree level , all other masses and mixing angles",
    "are then fixed .",
    "the diphoton partial higgs width prediction of the mssm depends sensitively on these two parameters , even in the decoupling limit of large @xmath12 gev .",
    "this regime , down to even lower @xmath11 for intermediate values of @xmath4 , is not covered at the lhc @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important at this stage of the design of future collider schemes to investigate what the compton collider option can contribute to the high precision measurements of the parameters of physics above the electroweak braking scales . in this context",
    "we summarize the status of the background ( bg ) process @xmath5 , @xmath13 relevant to the accurate determination of the signal ( s ) process @xmath14 in the next section .",
    "we then discuss our jet definition and assumptions about the collider parameters and present first monte carlo results .",
    "+     +    @xmath15 +",
    "the qcd corrections for both s and bg reactions are considerable and must be taken into account properly in order to precisely determine the diphoton higgs width . in the next two sections",
    "we briefly summarize the radiative corrections relevant to our desired high ( @xmath16 few % ) accuracy for both processes .",
    "in this section we review the qcd corrections to the continuum heavy quark production in polarized photon - photon collisions .",
    "for the two possible @xmath17 states we have at the born level : @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the quark velocity , @xmath20 the @xmath21 c.m .",
    "collision energy , @xmath22 the electromagnetic coupling , @xmath23 the charge of quark @xmath24 and @xmath25 its pole mass .",
    "the scattering angle of the produced ( anti)quark relative to the beam direction is denoted by @xmath26 .",
    "[ eq : bj0 ] clearly displays the important feature that the @xmath27 cross section has a relative @xmath28 suppression compared to the @xmath29 cross section . since the higgs @xmath30 process only occurs for @xmath31 , it is this polarization that is crucial for the precision measurement of the higgs partial decay width .",
    "there are , however , important radiative corrections to the @xmath27 cross section as large non - sudakov double logarithm enter into loop effects @xcite and real bremsstrahlung corrections can even remove the mass suppression @xcite . in this work",
    "we will include the exact one loop corrections of ref .",
    "@xcite ( for both spin configurations ) and use the recently achieved all orders resummed dl - result of ref .",

    "@xcite it was pointed out that one needs to include at least _ four _ loops ( at the cross section level ) of the non - sudakov hard logarithms in order to achieve positivity and stability . at this level of approximation",
    "there is an additional major source of uncertainty in the scale choice of the qcd coupling , two possible ` natural ' choices  @xmath36 and @xmath37  yielding very different numerical results .",
    "these uncertainties were removed in ref .",
    "@xcite by employing a running coupling into each loop integration .",
    "the correct running scale was found to be @xmath38 in terms of the perpendicular sudakov components and was implemented by using @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 and for qcd we have @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 as usual . up to two loops the massless @xmath45-function is independent of the chosen renormalization scheme and is gauge invariant in minimally subtracted schemes to all orders .",
    "these features also hold for the renormalization group ( rg ) improved form factors below and lead to @xcite : @xmath46 where the rg - massive sudakov form factor is given by : @xmath47    @xmath15 +   +    @xmath15 +    and the hard ( non - sudakov ) rg form factor by : @xmath48 the effect of using the rg - form factors compared to the dl resummed result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : vps ] . here",
    "we choose the gluon energy cut @xmath49 . at one loop",
    "there is no @xmath50 dependence while at higher orders there inevitably is .",
    "an intermediate mass higgs boson has a very narrow total decay width .",
    "it is therefore appropriate to compare the total number of higgs signal events with the number of ( continuum ) background events integrated over a narrow energy window around the higgs mass .",
    "the size of this window depends on the level of monochromaticity that can be achieved for the polarized photon beams .    in general ,",
    "the number of events for the ( signal ) process @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 where @xmath54 denotes the center of mass energy .",
    "for @xmath55 we have the following breit - wigner cross section @xcite @xmath56 where the conversion factor @xmath57  fb  gev@xmath58 . in the narrow width approximation",
    "we then find for the expected number of events @xmath59 to quantify this , we take the design parameters of the proposed tesla linear collider @xcite , which correspond to an integrated peak @xmath3-luminosity of 15 fb@xmath60 for the low energy running of the compton collider .",
    "the polarizations of the incident electron beams and the laser photons are chosen such that the product of the helicities @xmath61 .",
    "this ensures high monochromaticity and polarization of the photon beams . in this scenario",
    "we find a typical higgs mass resolution of 10  gev , so that for the background process @xmath62 we use @xmath63 with @xmath640.5 fb@xmath60/gev .",
    "the number of background events is then given by @xmath65 in other words , the number of signal events is proportional to @xmath66 while the number of continuum heavy quark production events is proportional to @xmath67 . in principle",
    "it is possible to use the exact compton profile of the backscattered photons to obtain the full luminosity distributions .",
    "the number of expected events is then given as a convolution of the energy dependent luminosity and the cross sections .",
    "our approach described above corresponds to an effective description of these convolutions , since these functions are not precisely known at present .",
    "note that the functional forms currently used generally assume that only one scattering takes place for each photon , which may not be realistic .",
    "once the exact luminosity functions are experimentally determined it is of course trivial to incorporate them into a monte carlo program containing the physics described in this paper .",
    "we next summarize the radiative corrections entering into the calculation of the expected number of higgs events .",
    "for the quantity @xmath9 there are three main standard model contributions , depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ggh ] : the @xmath1 and @xmath68 and @xmath69quark loops .",
    "we include these at the one loop level , since the radiative corrections are significant only for the @xmath69quark .",
    "the branching ratio @xmath70 is treated in the following way .",
    "the first component consists of the partial @xmath71 width .",
    "obviously we must use the same two - jet criterion for the signal as for the background . for our purposes a cone - type algorithm is most suitable , and so we use the sterman - weinberg two - jet definition depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : jet ] .",
    "note that the signal cross section is corrected by the _",
    "same _ resummed renormalization group improved form factor given in eq .",
    "[ eq : rpvrgex ] , since this factor does not depend on the spin of the particle coupling to the final state quark anti - quark pair .",
    "+     +    @xmath15 +    @xmath15 +   +    @xmath15 +    in addition we use the exact one - loop corrections from ref .",
    "these revealed that the largest radiative corrections are well described by using the running quark mass evaluated at the higgs mass scale .",
    "we therefore resum the leading running mass term to all orders . for the real bremsstrahlung corrections we use our own @xmath72 matrix elements .",
    "an important check is obtained by integrating over all phase space and reproducing the analytical results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the second quantity entering the branching ratio is the total higgs width @xmath73 .",
    "here we use the known results summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite , and include the partial higgs to @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 decay widths with all relevant radiative corrections .",
    "@xmath15 +   +    @xmath15 +    @xmath15 +   +    @xmath15 +    in this section we are presenting first ( conservative ) results based on the minimally achievable detector performance expected for the tesla design @xcite .",
    "all relevant radiative corrections discussed above are included and the two jet definition is the one discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on sterman - weinberg parameters and identifying @xmath80 .",
    "we thus arrive at @xmath81 where the three contributions contain the rg - improved form factors , the exact one loop subleading corrections and the hard bremsstrahlung radiation inside the cone of half - angle @xmath82 respectively .",
    "[ fig : ne203 ] assumes a 70% double b - tagging efficiency and a 3% probability of counting a @xmath75-pair as a @xmath74-pair .",
    "the figures show two curves for a ratio of @xmath83 and @xmath84 as well as differing cuts on the jet thrust angle @xmath26 .",
    "one can see clearly that a high charm suppression rate is highly desirable . while the larger thrust angle cut @xmath85 leads to a larger ratio of s to bg events ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : sbg203 ] ) , the inverse statistical significance , displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : sa203 ] , is slightly lower for @xmath86 .",
    "although several questions concerning the dependence of these monte carlo results on the various jet parameters should be addressed more carefully , it seems safe to assume that statistically an @xmath87 measurement for the diphoton partial higgs width is feasible can be measured from higgs - strahlung at the 1% level . ] .",
    "more thorough investigations will be presented in ref .",
    "in this paper we have included all available and relevant radiative corrections for the measurement of the partial higgs width @xmath88 .",
    "conservative assumptions about the expected machine and detector parameters lead to the preliminary result that over a four years of running time the diphoton partial width can be measured with a statistical uncertainty of @xmath89",
    ". this level of precision could be very important for large pseudoscalar higgs masses in theories , such as the mssm , with extended higgs sectors and could significantly enhance the kinematical reach for new physics .",
