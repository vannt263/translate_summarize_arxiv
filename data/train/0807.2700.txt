    "@xmath42 the velocity @xmath43 can in the following safely be put to unity .",

    "of course , our model is valid also in this case , but experimenters prefer to stay in the region where the description is simple , meaning @xmath143 . from fig .",

    "it affects both born and polarizability parts of the compton amplitudes .",
    "the born term becomes , essentially , multiplied by the sum of elastic coulomb and hadronic pion - nucleus scattering amplitudes .",
    "for the polarizability terms there is a corresponding sum , but whereas the coulomb amplitude is the same , the hadronic one is different and substantially weaker .",
    "numerical estimates of the various contributions are presented .",
    "the outcome is that if one is interested in extracting polarizability contributions , it is advantageous to restrict oneself to momentum transfers @xmath147 ( gev/@xmath96)@xmath141 , since there the ratio between polarizability and born contributions remains essentially the same as in free pion compton scattering .",
    "increasing the momentum transfer means increasing the importance of hadronic scattering .",
    "the ratio then changes in an important way , and varies with momentum transfer . pushing into the momentum transfers region @xmath148 ( gev/@xmath96)@xmath141 we come into a region where hadronic scattering dominates , and where in addition the contribution from the polarizability terms diminishes",
    "in this appendix we explain how we have calculated the coulomb and nuclear amplitudes .",
    "it is then important to remember that we need the amplitudes only for small momentum transfers , meaning that the structure of the nuclear surface region will not be important .",

    "<S> pion - nucleus bremsstrahlung offers a possibility of measuring the structure functions of pion - compton scattering from a study of the small - momentum - transfer region where the bremsstrahlung reaction is dominated by the single - photon - exchange mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding cross - section distribution is characterized by a sharp peak at small momentum transfers . </S>",
    "<S> but there is also a hadronic contribution which is smooth and constitutes an undesired background . in this communication </S>",
    "<S> the modification of the single - photon exchange amplitude by multiple - coulomb scattering is investigated as well as the coulomb - nuclear interference term . </S>"
