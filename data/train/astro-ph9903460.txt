    "various observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) have led to the claim that it is anisotropic ( see reviews readhead & lawrence 1992 ; white , scott & silk 1994 ) .",
    "measurement of these anisotropies provides information on structural formation , inflation , quantum gravity , topological defects ( strings , etc . ) , dark matter type and abundance , the determination of @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , the geometry and dynamics of the universe , the thermal history of the universe at the recombination epoch , etc .",
    "a knowledge of these anisotropies is very important for discriminating among different cosmological models as well as for measuring certain related parameters .",
    "unfortunately , this information is contaminated by several effects which are unrelated to cosmology , and which are either extragalactic or galactic in origin .",
    "extragalactic sources of such contamination may be gravitational scattering due to inhomogeneities in the matter distribution of superclusters ( fukushige , makino & ebisuzaki 1994 ; suginohara , suginohara & spergel 1998 ) , inhomogeneous reionization ( knox , scoccimarro & dodelson 1998 ) , possible radiative decay of massive tau neutrinos ( celebonovic , samurovic & circovic 1997 ) , the inverse compton effect , temporal variations of the gravitational potential , etc .",
    "this paper will not analyse such extragalactic sources of anisotropy but will concentrate instead on those coming from our own galaxy , particularly at large angular separations ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "a summary of possible contributions from our own galaxy to the anisotropies has been studied , for instance , by bennett et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and has led to the conclusion that there are three possible emission mechanisms : synchrotron , free - free and dust emission .",
    "the calculation of anisotropies originating in our galaxy was carried out on the basis of observations from the _ cobe_-dirbe , which were extrapolated to other frequencies , and it was concluded that galactic contamination is negligible .",
    "the paper of bennett et al . was optimistic .",
    "however , not all authors think the same .",
    "masi et al . ( 1990 ) pointed out that dust may provide an important contribution to the anisotropies in the microwave region .",
    "banday & wolfendale ( 1991 ) predicted that dust contamination is quite important except in some regions away from the cirrus .",
    "hence , whether or not the dust contribution is negligible seemed to be a point of contention by the beginning of nineties .",
    "recently , clear evidence of correlations between far - infrared maps ( which trace galactic dust ) and microwaves has been presented ( kogut et al .",
    "1996a , de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1998 ) . in the light of these works",
    "it is difficult to deny the influence of the galaxy on the microwave background .",
    "even though the source of the contamination remains unknown , the correlation between the galaxy and _ cobe_-dmr data remains an observational fact .",
    "another recent paper written by pando , valls - gabaud & fang ( 1998 ) points out the non - gaussian nature of the cmbr over large angular scales of anisotropies against standard cosmological predicitions , and this might be due to an excess of foreground contamination .    in this paper ,",
    "an explanation is offered for these last observational facts .",
    "two new elements are added to previous works for the calculation of galactic contamination : a frequency - dependent contrast of molecular clouds with respect to the galactic background of the diffuse interstellar medium ; and the existence of a recently noticed source of emission : rotational emission by dust grains ( draine & lazarian 1998a ) .",
    "these lead to a non - negligible and possibly unique source of anisotropies due to our galaxy .",
    "the existence of flux anisotropies due to galactic clouds is undeniable . in the far infrared ,",
    "the presence of the molecular clouds is associated with `` infrared cirrus '' .",
    "there is a good correlation between infrared cirrus and atomic hydrogen gas ( boulanger , baud & van albada 1985 ; burton & deul 1987 ; boulanger & prault 1988 ; schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) and the fluctuations of the hydrogen column densities within the nearest 75 to 100 pc of the sun are occasionally about @xmath4 @xmath5 ( frisch & york 1986 ) , so this implies that fluctuations due to nearby clouds must be detected to some extent in the microwave region .    most of the clouds are confined in the galactic plane but there are few which can be observed at high galactic latitudes , and which are close to us ( blitz 1991 ) .",
    "those responsible for large angle correlations would need to have a large size ( i.e. giant molecular clouds ) .",
    "so , some microwave background radiation anisotropies ( mbras ) may be due to inhomogeneities in the density distribution of the local interstellar medium .",
    "dust associated with these giant clouds exists in three different stages associated with molecular , neutral and ionized hydrogen ( sodroski et al .",
    "1997 ) , whose total emission gives a continuum spectrum proportional to the column density in the line of sight .",
    "column density fluctuations lead to intensity fluctuations .",
    "dust anisotropies would be due to its non - homogeneous distribution in molecular clouds or its equivalent for other types of galactic emission .",
    "dark matter around spiral galaxies in the form of cold gas , essentially in molecular form and rotationally supported , was purposed by pfenninger , combes & martinet ( 1994 ) and pfeninger & combes ( 1994 ) ; this cold gas in molecular form was also held to contribute at microwave wavelengths ( schaefer 1994 ; schaefer 1996 ) .",
    "the gas would be at temperatures close to @xmath6 k and composed of small clumpuscules of size @xmath7 au .",
    "it is claimed ( combes & pfenniger 1997 ; schaefer 1996 ) that part of the radiation observed by _",
    "cobe_-firas is cold gas instead of dust .",
    "it might be in the outer disc and difficult , although not impossible , to detect .",
    "indeed , combes & pfenninger ( 1997 ) propose techniques for detecting it . though this cold gas may be a source of anisotropies , it would be only for very small scales since the emission is high enough just for very high densities ( @xmath8 @xmath9 ) inside the small clumpuscules .",
    "thence , cold molecular gas emission will not be further considered .    in following subsections , the expected emission from our galaxy will be compared with observations in the microwave region .      the two - point correlation function is :    @xmath10    , where @xmath11 is the antenna temperature , were obtained from the intensity maps at 1.42 ghz and 240@xmath12 m multiplied by the factor @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the light speed and @xmath15 is the boltzmann constant .",

    "since the whole sky was not covered , only available regions with @xmath16 were used ( @xmath17 ) .",

    "free - free emission is not considered here in order to simplify the calculations and because we have no information concerning it ( smoot 1998 ) . in any case , if it is proven than dust or synchrotron emission or both are high enough then adding free - free emission would increase galactic anisotropies , never decrease .    at any frequency in the microwave range ,",
    "two - point correlation functions must be evaluated by extrapolating both effects independently and summing them up according to :    @xmath18 @xmath19@xmath20    each of these terms may be calculated by means of an extrapolation of previously measured correlations .",
    "i will calculate the contribution due to the local galactic flux fluctuations with respect the average flux , i.e. @xmath21 , and not that due to the smooth variation of the dependence of this average flux with galactic coordinates .",
    "usually , the extrapolation is carried out by multiplying each of the pixels of the map at @xmath22 by the mean amplitude variation of the flux ( @xmath23 ) and calculating the correlations of the new map at frequency @xmath24 .",
    "this is equivalent to multiply the two - point correlation function by a factor @xmath25 .",
    "i will go one step further and will take into account that the local fluctuations do not vary proportionally to the average flux ( fig .",
    "[ fig : explica ] ) ; therefore , the mean amplitude of the two - point correlation function is affected by a second factor . as we will see later , this variation is due to different effective dust temperatures between the galactic clouds which produce the fluctuations and the galactic medium that contributes to the average flux .",
    "the shape of two - point correlation function is also expected to vary , as will be explained in  [ .diffreq ] . however , since we want to estimate only the order of magnitude of the correlation amplitude in the microwave region , we will not take this effect into account at this stage .",

    "the difference is also    related to the different distribution of dust - grain sizes in the    diffuse interstellar medium and in molecular clouds .",
    "the rate of small    grains is larger in the diffuse interstellar medium than in the clouds    and the temperatures are different implying that the peak emission    from clouds occurs at different wavelength as compared with that of    the diffuse medium ( greenberg & li 1996 ) .",
    "+    these second factors are unknown because the anisotropies are not    sufficiently explored for wavelengths longer than 240    @xmath12 m . in order to give a rough estimate ,",

    "1992 ) or other previous experiments ( melchiorri et al . 1981 ) at 6@xmath71 scale show that cmbr anisotropies at 90 - 870 ghz or 410 ghz respectively are less than 35 or 40 @xmath72 at some regions at high galactic latitudes , after galactic emission subtraction .",

    "fluctuations for the intermediate frequencies can not be calculated since the value of @xmath68 ( second factor ) as a function of the frequency is unknown .",

    "maybe under some particular , but not impossible , conditions all the microwave background radiation anisotropies be due to galactic foregrounds rather than cosmological in origin . some arguments could be given against this and i will discuss them in next subsections .",
    "the main argument in favour of a cosmological origin of the mbras is that these do not depend on frequency . strictly speaking , observations point out that the anisotropies at 53 and 90 ghz are nearly the same , but that they are higher at 31 ghz ( by a factor 2 or so in difference , hinshaw et al .",
    "this favours a cosmological origin of the mbras but not to the total exclusion of a galactic origin .",

    "this , however , might be reduced when we choose other parameters for the dust rotational emission predictions by draine & lazarian ( 1998a ) .",
    "the aim here has been to show that it is perfectly possible to explain the observational anisotropies at microwave frequencies in terms of galactic clouds rather than constructing an accurate model .",

    "the main objection to this argument might be that it would be an enormous coincidence that @xmath68 should be 0.8 or , equivalently , in any rotational - emission prediction , that the range of nearly constant @xmath47 should be between 50 and 90 ghz .    the predicted existence of rotational emission much more intense than free - free emission ( draine & lazarian 1998a ) is controversial and not yet proven .",
    "its existence is used in this paper as a plausible candidate for a non - thermal contribution of emission correlated with dust .",
    "however , it is not essential to justify anisotropies at 53 ghz .",
    "other mechanisms could be used instead . free ",
    "free is an option , though there are problems in justifying the necessary flux for the total anisotropies .",
    "another mechanism is the thermal fluctuations of the magnetization within individual interstellar grains when most interstellar fe exists in a moderately ferromagnetic material ( draine & lazarian 1998b ) .",

    "1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "the role played by rotational emission with a spectral index @xmath47 less than zero can be substituted by the free emission or others .",
    "it was shown that galactic cirrus emission is high enough to explain observed anisotropies at 90 ghz ( fig .",
    "[ fig : corrtotal ] ) . whether this level of anisotropy may be maintained for lower frequencies down to 50 ghz",
    "would be merely a question of fitting some parameter to other emissions .",

    "one remarkable feature of mbras that rouses suspicion about their relationship to our galaxy is the coincidence of the typical angular size of their structures with the typical angular size of nearby clouds .",

    "the correlation becomes null  first zero  around 30 deg at both galactic and observed _ cobe_-dmr .",
    "the first zero is related to the average angular size of the clouds when they are responsible for the anisotropies ( lpez - corredoira et al .",
    "1998 ) , and this coincidence implies that the average angular size of the supposed cosmological structures is approximately equal to that of the nearby clouds giving rise to anisotropies .",
    "the linear size of giant clouds is normally between 20 and 100 pc ( scoville & sanders 1986 ) and can even reach sizes between 60 and 300 pc ( magnani , blitz & mundi 1985 ; heiles , reach & boo 1988 ) .",
    "the projection of nearby structures such as these gives rise to inhomogeneities and irregular arcs extending between 10@xmath91 and 50@xmath71 on the sky ( low & cutri 1994 ) in the form of infrared cirrus . in the range from @xmath92 and @xmath93 ghz",
    ", the galactic contribution must also provide anisotropies with a first zero around 20 or 30 deg because this is the mean angular size of the clouds , independent of the frequency ( the first zero for synchrotron emission is somewhat less than 20 degrees as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : corr]a ) .",
    "this is precisely what is observed for the total anisotropies .",
    "most authors claim that these anisotropies are cosmological rather than galactic but the coincidence referred to here might be due to more than just chance .",
    "though this does not prove anything , it is nevertheless a sign in favour of the galactic predominance in mbras .",
    "although anisotropies over the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum may be due to inhomogeneities in the galactic distribution of dust and gas , this does not mean that the flux maxima and minima at different frequencies must occur at exactly the same coordinates .",
    "several effects ",
    "synchrotron , free - free , dust emission , etc.are responsible for continuum emission but some effects predominate over others at different frequencies .",
    "different effects arise in different regions : synchrotron is higher where magnetic fields are stronger , free - free radiation where a warm ionized medium is present and dust where the coldest temperatures are reached ( bennett et al . 1992 ) .",
    "peaks of dust emission are also to be observed at different positions with different frequencies since cold or warm dust are in different locations ; small particles  which are dominant at microwave frequencies ( draine & lazarian 1998a)and large particles  which are dominant in the far infrared ( greenberg & li 1996)may be distributed differently in the clouds , etc .",
    "thus , we can not expect uniformity in galactic structures at different frequencies , i.e. an exact correlation for different frequencies .",
    "such a nonuniformity is observed , for instance , by davies , watson & gutirrez ( 1996 , their fig .",

    "[ fig : corr_cross ] , some cross - correlation is also observed at scales between 8 and 30 deg , while there is an anticorrelation for less than 8 deg . the microwave continuum in the range between 14 and 90 ghz was also found to be correlated with 100@xmath12 m thermal emission from interstellar dust ( kogut et al .",
    "1996a ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "1997 ; de oliveira - costa et al .",
    "this was interpreted as a good correlation existing between dust and free - free emission ( kogut et al .",
    "1996a , 1996b ) ; however , the correlations between h@xmath47normally a good tracer of free - free emission  with cmb and dirbe maps are weak ( leitch et al . 1997 ; kogut 1997 ) .",
    "leitch et al .",
    "( 1997 ) alternatively proposed an anomalous bremsstrahlung emission from hot gas , but this was again inconsistent with the observed power radiated ( draine & lazarian 1998a ) , so other kinds of emissions correlated with dust must be present .",
    "hence , it must be concluded that correlation among different structures for different frequencies can not be an argument either for proving or disproving the galactic origin of the anisotropies , although some non - negligible galactic contamination is necessary in order to explain these last correlations .    the statistical distribution of the fluctuations given by the two - point correlation function , or its fourier transform  the power spectrum  is also expected to vary at different frequencies .",
    "the coldest parts of the clouds produce dominant emission at lower frequencies so the cloud shapes vary when the frequency varies .",
    "moreover , the dust power spectrum is very sensitive to the region of sky selected ( guarini , melchiorri & melchiorri 1995 ) , the background subtraction and other details . as a matter of fact , different spectral indices have been obtained by different authors for the dust emission : @xmath94 ( gautier et al . 1992 ) , @xmath95 ( melchiorri et al . 1996 ) , @xmath96 for @xmath97 ( schlegel , finkbeiner & davis 1998 ) , etc .    at microwave frequencies",
    ", we can not expect the same power spectra as in the far infrared .",
    "some unknown changes are expected . according to this",
    ", power - spectrum or two - point correlation function shapes should not be used to determine whether the anisotropies come from the galaxy or are cosmological .",
    "the fact that the angular power spectra observed at high galactic latitudes by _",
    "cobe_-dirbe are steeper than the _ cobe_-dmr power spectrum should not be used , as in wright ( 1998 ) , to evaluate the degree of galactic contamination .",
    "the shape of the correlation function is also different from the observational data in the microwave region in fig .",
    "[ fig : corrtotal ] : there is a deficit of correlation at @xmath98 deg and an excess of correlation at @xmath99 deg .",
    "this may be , as has been said , because the shape of dust in far infrared was extrapolated in spite of the fact that variations were expected (  [ .diffreq ] ) , and that the cloud intensity fall - off from its centre is different at 240 @xmath12 m from that at microwave frequencies .",
    "the extrapolation of dust emission as a combination of three factors was carried out in ( [ ext2 ] ) under the assumption of a non - angular dependence of the first and second factor .",
    "this dependence would introduce much more complex calculations for which we do not have accurate enough data ( it was not got sufficient information about the correlations at wavelengths longer than 240 @xmath12 m ) , although it can be proven that the order of magnitude of the previous calculations would not change . in any case , the approach taken here is better than any other prior to this paper and the results are more trustworthy .    according to the hypothesis that clouds colder than the diffuse interstellar medium produce the anisotropies , the variation of the temperature within these clouds would produce variations in the @xmath100 shape . in a simple model of emission , in which the cloud flux is proportional to @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is the effective grain temperature , the antenna temperature @xmath59 is proportional to @xmath103 .",
    "@xmath102 is large enough to take the rayleigh ",

    "this implies that the variation of the antenna temperature in the microwave region is proportional to the variation of the effective grain temperatures . for the calculation of @xmath100 ,",
    "our approach contains a relative error    @xmath105    where @xmath106 is the mean variation of @xmath102 with respect its average value along two lines of sight separated by an angle @xmath38 .",

    "this may justify the difference of the shape in the plots of figure [ fig : corrtotal ] . in any case , the mean amplitude over the whole range is the one calculated above ; there will be some angles in which the amplitude would be higher and others in which it would be lower although the galactic contamination is within the order of magnitude of the observed anisotropies .    from the iras",

    "a testable prediction of such a case would be that the amplitude of the fluctuations for @xmath129 would be about the half of that for @xmath16 for angles around 5 degrees .",
    "the implications of such a question are extremely important , not merely for refining some quantity or other or for making certain corrections to get an accurate result for an individual parameter , but because it would result in a different qualitative description of the universe . the implications for inflation theories or the formation of the large - scale structure of the universe would be enormous , and our ideas regarding such formations would change completely .",
    "hence , i think studying the influence of the galaxy is a valuable exercise , in order to avoid the hazarding of cosmological theories based on cumulative errors , in which this paper claim to be still an open question .",
    "the following main conclusions may be drawn from this paper :    * the extrapolation of anisotropies following the mean dust emission is a bad approximation since it does not take into account the growing contrast of colder clouds in the background of the diffuse interstellar medium . by considering this effect ,",
    "it is found that dust thermal emission anisotropies are higher than expected by other authors , and that their amplitude is comparable to the observational data at 90 ghz . * our ignorance of the different emission mechanisms around 50 ghz ( free - free , dust rotational emission , magnetic dipole emission from dust grains ) do not allow the firm conclusion that anisotropies due to galactic emission are not frequency dependent but this possibility remains open . *",
    "if galaxy - induced anisotropies are not responsible for the totality of the correlations they would at least be a non - negligible part of them , so untrustworthy cosmological conclusions could be reached from microwave background radiation anisotropy analysis unless possible galactic emission processes are correctly subtracted . *",
    "if the galaxy - induced anisotropies made up the total correlations at microwave frequencies , then inflation , models of galaxy formation and many parts of the standard cosmology would be wrong .",
