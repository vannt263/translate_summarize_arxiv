    "nonadiabatic transition due to potential curve crossing is one of the most important mechanisms to effectively induce electronic transitions in collisions @xcite .",
    "this is a very interdisciplinary concept and appears in various fields of physics , chemistry and biology @xcite .",
    "two state curve crossing is in general classified into the following two cases according to the crossing scheme : ( 1 ) landau - zener ( l.z ) case , in which the two diabatic potential curves have the same signs for the slopes and ( 2 ) non - adiabatic tunnelling ( n.t ) case , in which the diabatic curves have the opposite sign for slopes .",
    "there is also a non - crossing non - adiabatic transition called the rosen - zener - demkov type @xcite , in which two adiabatic potentials are in near resonance at large @xmath0 .",
    "the theory of non - adiabatic transitions dates back to @xmath1 , when the pioneering works for curve - crossing and non - crossing were published by landau @xcite , zener @xcite and stueckelberg @xcite and by rosen and zener @xcite respectively .",
    "since then numerous papers by many authors have been devoted to these subjects , especially to curve crossing problems@xcite . in our earlier papers",
    "we have proposed an exactly solvable model for the two state curve crossing problem which assumes the coupling to be a dirac delta function @xcite .",
    "this model is used to calculate the effect of curve crossing on electronic absorption spectrum and on resonance raman excitation profile for the case of harmonic potentials @xcite .",
    "we have later generalized our model to deal with general multi - channel curve crossing problem too @xcite .",
    "even very recently our model ia extended to deal with nonadiabatic tunneling in an ideal one dimensional semi - infinite periodic potential systems @xcite .",
    "we have also proposed an analytical method for the two state curve crossing problem for any coupling @xcite .",
    "we have also used our analytically solvable to deal with scattering problems @xcite . the same method has been applied recently to the case of predissociation @xcite .",
    "our work is in progress to deal with nonadiabatic tunneling in an ideal one dimensional finite periodic potential systems @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have extended our model to deal with the curve crossing induced dissociation cases . in this paper",
    "we analyze the effect of curve crossing induced dissociation on electronic absorption spectrum and resonance raman excitation profile using a model consisting of a harmonic oscillator and a morse oscillator , coupled by dirac delta function .",
    "we consider two diabatic curves , crossing each other . there is a coupling between the two curves , which causes transitions from one curve to another .",
    "this transition would occur in the vicinity of the crossing point .",
    "in particular , it will occur in a narrow range of @xmath2 , given by @xmath3 where @xmath2 denotes the nuclear coordinate and @xmath4 is the crossing point . @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the diabatic potentials and @xmath7 represent the coupling between them . in reality",
    "the transition between @xmath8 and @xmath9 occur most effectively at the crossing , because the necessary energy transfer between the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom is minimum there .",
    "therefore it is interesting to analyze a model , where coupling is localized in space near @xmath4 rather than using a model where coupling is same everywhere ( i.e. constant coupling ) .",
    "thus we put @xmath10 here @xmath11 is a constant .",
    "this model has the advantage that it can be analytically solved @xcite .",
    "we start with a particle moving on any of the two diabatic curves .",
    "the problem is to calculate the probability that the particle will still be on any one of the diabatic curves after a time @xmath12 .",
    "we write the probability amplitude as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the probability amplitude for the two states . @xmath16",
    "obey the time dependent schr@xmath17 dinger equation ( we take @xmath18 here and in subsequent calculations ) @xmath19 @xmath20 is defined by @xmath21 where @xmath22 is @xmath23 we find it convenient to define the half fourier transform @xmath24 of @xmath25 by @xmath26 half fourier transformation of eq .",
    "( [ 4 ] ) leads to @xmath27 where @xmath28 is defined by @xmath29 in the position representation , the above equation may be written as @xmath30 where @xmath31 is @xmath32 writing @xmath33 and using the partitioning technique @xcite we can write @xmath34^{-1}|x_0\\rangle.\\ ] ] the above equation is true for any general @xmath7 .",
    "this expression simplify considerably if @xmath7 is a delta function located at @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath35 where @xmath36 and corresponds to propagation of the particle starting at @xmath37 on the second diabatic curve , in the absence of coupling to the first diabatic curve . using the same procedure one can get @xmath38",
    "similarly one can derive expressions for @xmath39 and @xmath40 . using these expressions for the green s function in eq .",
    "( [ 11 ] ) we can calculate @xmath41 explicitly .",
    "the expressions that we have obtained for @xmath42 are quite general and are valid for any @xmath43 and @xmath44 . however , their utility is limited by the fact that one must know @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "it is possible to find @xmath47 only in a few limited cases and the morse oscillator is one of them @xcite .",
    "in this section we apply the method to the problem involving a harmonic oscillator and a morse oscillator , coupled by dirac delta function . we consider a system of three potential energy curves , ground electronic state and two ` crossing ' excited electronic states ( electronic transition to one of them is assumed to be dipole forbidden and while it is allowed to the other ) @xcite .",
    "we calculate the effect of ` crossing ' induced dissociation on electronic absorption spectra and on resonance raman excitation profile .",
    "the propagating wave functions on the excited state potential energy curves are given by solution of the time dependent schrdinger equation @xmath48 in the above equation @xmath49 and @xmath50 describes the vibrational motion of the system in the first electronic excited state ( allowed ) and second electronic excited state ( forbidden ) respectively @xmath51 and @xmath52 ^ 2.\\ ] ] in the above @xmath53 is the oscillator s mass , @xmath54 is the vibrational frequency of the first electronic excited state and @xmath55 is the dissociation energies of the forbidden states and @xmath2 is the vibrational coordinate .",
    "shifts of the vibrational coordinate minimum upon excitation are given by @xmath56 and @xmath57 , and @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) represent coupling between the two diabatic potentials which is taken to be @xmath60 where @xmath11 represent the strength of the coupling .",
    "the intensity of electronic absorption spectra is given by @xcite @xmath61,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath62^{-1}|x_0\\rangle .\\ ] ] and @xmath63 here , @xmath64 is a phenomenological damping constant which account for the life time effects .",
    "@xmath65 is given by @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the ground vibrational state of the ground electronic state , @xmath68 is the vibrational frequency on the ground electronic state , @xmath69 is the energy difference between the excited ( allowed ) and ground electronic state , and for the forbidden electronic state it s value is @xmath70 .",
    "similarly resonance raman scattering intensity can be expressed in terms of green s function and is given by @xcite .",
    "@xmath71 in the above @xmath72 is given by @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the final vibrational state of the ground electronic state .",
    "as @xmath75 for the harmonic potential is known @xcite , we can calculate @xmath76 .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ n53 ] ) to calculate the effect of curve crossing induced dissociation on resonance raman excitation profile .      in the following we give results for the effect of curve crossing on electronic absorption spectrum and resonance raman excitation profile in the case where one dipole allowed electronic state crosses with a dipole forbidden electronic state as in fig .",
    "[ curveapply ] . as in @xcite ,",
    "the ground state curve is taken to be a harmonic potential energy curve with its minimum at zero .",
    "the curve is constructed to be representative of the potential energy along a metal - ligand stretching coordinate .",
    "we take the mass as @xmath77 and the vibrational wavenumber as @xmath78 @xcite for the ground state .",
    "the first diabatic excited state potential energy curve is displaced by @xmath79 and is taken to have a vibrational wavenumber of @xmath78 .",
    "transition to this state is allowed .",
    "the minimum of the potential energy curve is taken to be above @xmath80 of that of the ground state curve .",
    "the second diabatic excited state potential energy curve is taken to be an un - displaced excited state .",
    "on that potential energy curve , the vibration is taken to have same wavenumber of @xmath78 .",
    "its minimum is @xmath81 above that of the ground state curve .",
    "transition to this state is assumed to be dipole forbidden .",
    "the two diabatic curves cross at an energy of @xmath82 with @xmath83 .",
    "value of @xmath11 we use in our calculation is @xmath84 .",
    "the lifetime of both the excited states are taken to be @xmath85 .",
    "the calculated electronic absorption spectra is shown in fig .",
    "the profile shown by the dashed line is in the absence of any coupling to the second potential energy curve .",
    "the full line has the effect of coupling in it .",
    "the calculated resonance raman excitation profile is shown in fig .",
    "[ raman ] . the profile shown by the full line",
    "is calculated for the coupled potential energy curves . the profile shown by the dashed line",
    "is calculated for the uncoupled potential energy curves .",
    "it is seen that curve crossing effect can alter the absorption and raman excitation profile significantly .",
    "however it is the raman excitation profile that is more effected .",
    "in our earlier paper we have proposed an exactly solvable model for the two state curve crossing problem . in this paper",
    "we have extended our model to deal with the case of curve crossing induced dissociation .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of curve crossing on electronic absorption spectrum and resonance raman excitation profile for a model consisting of a harmonic oscillator and a morse oscillator , coupled by dirac delta function .",
    "we find that the raman excitation profile is affected much more by the crossing than the electronic absorption spectrum .",
    "the same procedure is also applicable to the case where @xmath86 is a non - local operator , and may be represented by @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 are arbitrary acceptable functions . choosing both of them to be gaussian will be an improvement over the delta function coupling model , @xmath86 can also be a linear combination of such operators .",
