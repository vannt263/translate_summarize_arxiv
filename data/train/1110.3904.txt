    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics has been tested with great accuracy , there remain many issues that the sm can not explain , such as the origin of dark matter or the hierarchy between the electroweak scale and the planck scale .",
    "thus , we need physics beyond the sm .",
    "one of the most promising candidates is supersymmetry ( susy )  @xcite , which can solve the above problems naturally .",
    "moreover , the running of gauge coupling constants in susy suggests the unification of gauge interactions .    in the grand unified theories ( guts )  @xcite ,",
    "the gauge interaction is described by a gauge group @xmath0 with a single gauge coupling constant , which contains the standard model gauge group , @xmath1 , as a subgroup . thus far , many models of guts , especially its supersymmetric version ( susy guts ) have been proposed , such as those based on @xmath2 or @xmath3 . some of them directly break down to @xmath4 and others have one or more intermediate symmetry groups between @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "phenomenological aspects of guts have been studied intensively  @xcite .",
    "the idea of gut has also opened a window for studying the early universe such as baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "however , there is a severe problem in guts . when the gut gauge symmetry and other intermediate symmetry breaks down , topological defects  @xcite such as ( magnetic ) monopoles @xcite , strings or domain walls are formed through the kibble mechanism  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "magnetic monopoles are inevitably produced during the course of gut phase transition down to @xmath5 .",
    "they are copiously produced and overclose the universe , although the detail of monopole production depends on the pattern of symmetry breaking  @xcite .",
    "inflation  @xcite was proposed as a solution to this problem because inflationary expansion of the universe dilutes monopoles sufficiently .",
    "it can also solve other cosmological problems such as horizon and flatness problems and account for the origin of primordial fluctuations .",
    "now it is a part of `` standard '' cosmology . in order for the monopoles to be diluted sufficiently ,",
    "inflation must take place after the phase transition . on the other hand , scenarios in which phase transition takes place after inflation are ruled out unless one assumes an artificial mechanism to dilute them such as thermal inflation  @xcite . in order for the gut symmetry not to be restored after inflation ,",
    "the reheating temperature after inflation must be much smaller than the gut scale .",
    "otherwise , thermal effects might stabilize the higgs at the origin where the symmetry is restored .    in this paper , we emphasize that not only the reheating temperature , but also the hubble scale during inflation must be smaller than the gut scale in order to avoid the monopole problem in the context of f - term inflation models in supergravity  @xcite .",
    "a typical feature of f - term inflation models is the appearance of the hubble - induced mass  @xcite to any scalar field , which is inevitable unless one assumes some shift symmetries  @xcite or non - canonical k@xmath6hler potential . at the onset of inflation ,",
    "the hubble parameter is very large and gradually decreases during inflation .",
    "the higgs field responsible for the symmetry breaking also acquires the hubble - induced mass , and it may be this hubble mass term that controls the phase transition  @xcite in the way quite similar to the curvature induced phase transitions proposed in refs .  @xcite . in particular , it is possible that the phase transition takes place during inflation .",
    "this consideration leads us to the conclusion that the symmetry breaking scale must be larger than the hubble scale of inflation .    among many ( f - term ) inflation models ,",
    "chaotic inflation @xcite is one of the most interesting models from this viewpoint .",
    "it is one of the simplest models of inflation and predicts large tensor perturbation that can be detected by planck  @xcite , with its energy scale close to the gut scale @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , if future detection of b - mode polarization confirms the chaotic inflation , the symmetry breaking scale will be tightly constrained .",
    "moreover , it may be expected that the spontaneous symmetry breaking of gut , or other intermediate symmetries , takes place _ during _",
    "chaotic inflation .",
    "in such a case , the expected monopole flux may be within the reach of future experiments .    in this paper",
    ", we focus on the chaotic inflation model @xcite and study the feature of phase transition in detail .",
    "we find that the symmetry breaking scale associated with monopole production must be large enough so that it occurs well before the end of inflation .",
    "we carefully estimate the number density of monopoles at the time of the phase transition during chaotic inflation .",
    "we find that the symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 is bounded below as @xmath9 depending on the reheating temperature , with @xmath10 being the coupling constant in the model , if the @xmath11-mode of the cmb polarization is detected by on - going and future experiments such as planck @xcite , quiet+polarbear @xcite or litebird  @xcite .",
    "if the reheating temperature of the universe is determined by precise measurements of cmb  @xcite or the detection of inflationary gravitational waves  @xcite , this constraint becomes severer .",
    "moreover , we find that there are parameter space where the direct detection of monopoles can be expected",
    ".    this paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "we make a general discussion on the phase transition during inflation . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we investigate the case of chaotic inflation and monopole production quantitatively . the final section is devoted to conclusions and discussion .",
    "monopoles are topological defects that are formed when a gauge group @xmath12 breaks down to a subgroup @xmath13 of @xmath12 if the homotopy group satisfies @xmath14 .",
    "the spontaneous breaking of gut and other intermediate symmetries down to the sm gauge group generally predict monopole production  @xcite .",
    "when a scalar multiplet that has a gauge charge of @xmath12 acquires a nonvanishing expectation value , spontaneous symmetry breaking takes place . to be concrete ,",
    "let us consider following superpotentials for the higgs field , @xmath15 where the supermultiplet @xmath16 is adjoint representation of @xmath17 , or , @xmath18 where the supermultiplets @xmath19 are ( anti- ) fundamental representations of @xmath12 , or @xmath20 where supermultiplets @xmath21 are ( anti-)fundamental representations of @xmath22 with @xmath23 and oppositely charged under @xmath24 and so on . here",
    "@xmath25 is an additional singlet , @xmath10 is a numerical coefficient , which is taken to be real and positive , less than @xmath26 , and @xmath8 is a mass parameter corresponding to the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "if the system has a monopole solution , there are at least three scalar degrees of freedom whose potential can be reduced to @xmath27 after field redefinition and imposing d - flat condition . here",
    "@xmath28 is real scalar degrees of freedom .",
    "equation has a vacuum at @xmath29 , around which the @xmath12 is spontaneously broken .",
    "an illustrative example is a left - right symmetric group @xmath30 , broken by the vev of an adjoint representation @xmath16 of @xmath31 , which is further followed by the successive phase transition @xmath32 .",
    "this discussion is general in all the symmetry breaking that predicts monopole production .",
    "more concrete models will be discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "hereafter we mainly use @xmath16 as a higgs multiplet symbolically but the result is general .    before going into the discussion of phase transition during inflation , let us briefly see the phase transition triggered by thermal effects .",
    "the usual thermal phase transition proceeds as follows . at a high temperature ,",
    "the higgs field acquires a large thermal mass of order of @xmath33 and hence it is stabilized at the origin . as the temperature of the universe decreases , the bare tachyonic mass @xmath34 overwhelms thermal mass . at that time",
    "the higgs field becomes unstable and phase transition takes place producing monopoles .",
    "the monopole mass is given by @xcite , @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the gauge coupling constant .",
    "the monopole is so heavy that we can neglect the effect of monopole annihilation  @xcite . without a dilution mechanism  @xcite ,",
    "they would soon overclose the universe . in order to avoid the monopole overproduction in thermal phase transition",
    ", the reheating temperature after inflation can not be higher than the gut scale .",
    "in susy , however , there is an even more strict upper bound on the reheating temperature as @xmath37gev for avoiding the overproduction of the gravitino  @xcite .",
    "thus the gut symmetry is likely never restored thermally after inflation .    instead",
    ", the symmetry may be restored and the phase transition may be triggered by the hubble - induced mass , which we focus on hereafter . assuming canonical k@xmath6hler potential for the higgs multiplet(s ) , the scalar potential of the system includes a hubble - induced mass @xcite , @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the inflaton , @xmath40 is its superpotential and @xmath41 is the reduced planck mass should be regarded as the field whose f - term dominates the potential energy during inflation . it necessarily does not coincide with the inflaton in a usual sense , which is a slowly rolling scalar field in the potential . ] .",
    "here we have used the friedmann equation @xmath42 if @xmath43 at the end of inflation , the symmetry is not broken until the hubble parameter decreases to @xmath44 .",
    "thus , monopoles are produced after inflation , which leads to a cosmological disaster .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath45 at the end of inflation , the symmetry is broken before the end of inflation and monopoles can be diluted sufficiently .",
    "moreover , it is possible that the phase transition takes place just before the end of inflation if the hubble parameter decreases with a sizable rate during inflation .",
    "this argument offers us an important suggestion . in supersymmetric f - term inflation models ,",
    "the symmetry breaking scales of gut and other intermediate symmetries that are associated with monopole ( or domain wall ) production _ must _ be larger than the hubble parameter during inflation .",
    "note that gut gauge group @xmath0 does not have to break directly down to @xmath4 but it is possible that there are one or more gauge groups between @xmath0 and @xmath4 , as has been mentioned .",
    "therefore , there can be several breaking scales below the gut scale ( @xmath46 gev ) .",
    "all these symmetry breaking scales are constrained by this condition , if the corresponding symmetry breaking is associated with monopole or domain wall production .",
    "actually , the hubble parameter during inflation can be proved by the observation of @xmath11-mode polarization in cmb .",
    "tensor perturbation in the primordial perturbation , which is imprinted in the b - mode polarization , is related to the hubble parameter during inflation as @xmath47 if the satellite experiments such as planck @xcite or litebird @xcite , or the ground - based detectors such quiet+polarbear @xcite detect the @xmath11-mode of the cmb polarization in the near future , gut and other intermediate breaking scales will be severely constrained as @xmath48 gev @xmath49 for @xmath50 .",
    "interestingly enough , as noted earlier , the phase transition may take place just before the end of inflation .",
    "in such a case the dilution of monopoles is rather mild , and an observable amount of monopoles may be left in the universe .",
    "the precise constraint on the symmetry breaking scale @xmath8 depends on when the phase transition took place .",
    "it is interesting if the phase transition takes place slightly before the end of inflation , because monopole searches such as icecube  @xcite , combined with the detection of b - mode , will provide us with useful information on the gut symmetry breaking .",
    "we will investigate in detail the possibility of the phase transition and monopole production during inflation in the next section .",
    "note that there is much literature that discusses the monopole problem associated with the superpotential of the form eqs .  , , or , especially in the inflation models embedded in the higgs sector of the gut symmetry breaking .",
    "for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite , the shifted inflation is embedded in the su(5 ) gut model and the monopole problem is avoided by violating the su(5 ) gauge symmetry during the course of inflation already . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a flat direction in gut ( to be concrete , they choose pati - salam and so(10 ) models ) is identified with the inflaton for hybrid inflation and gut symmetry is broken already during inflation thanks to the higher dimensional operators . in ref .",
    "@xcite , nonminimal `` higgs '' inflation is embedded in the pati - salam model and the monopole problem is avoided by identifying the higgs field with the inflaton for the chaotic inflation , which means that pati - salam gauge symmetry is already broken during the course of inflation .",
    "other recent studies are listed in ref .",
    "generally , however , inflation does not need to be embedded in the gut - breaking sector . in this case ,",
    "gut symmetry restoration during inflation due to the large hubble - induced mass and succeeding phase transition is inevitable if the hubble parameter during inflation is large enough as we have seen above . moreover , since the symmetry preserving state must not be the local potential minimum , superpotential of the form eqs .  , , or is needed . here , we focus on such a case although the superpotential has a similar form to that for the hybrid inflation .",
    "in this section , we investigate monopole production during chaotic inflation in supergravity  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale at the end of chaotic inflation is around @xmath51 gev , which is close to the reasonable gut and other intermediate symmetry breaking scales .",
    "therefore , it is worth focusing on this specific inflation model .",
    "the k@xmath6hler and superpotential for the model we adopt here are @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the inflaton and @xmath54 is an additional singlet , @xmath55 is the inflaton mass and @xmath8 is the symmetry breaking scale .",
    "we impose @xmath56-symmetry and discrete @xmath57 symmetry in order to suppress all other unwanted couplings such as @xmath58 etc in the superpotential is allowed by these symmetries but it breaks the shift symmetry of @xmath53 . taking the inflaton mass @xmath55 as an order parameter of the shift symmetry breaking , we expect that the coupling constant @xmath59 is suppressed enough , say @xmath60 in planck units .",
    "thus , the following discussion does not change . ] .",
    "charge assignments on the fields are shown in table  i. in this model , the imaginary part of @xmath53 , @xmath61 acts as the inflaton because the shift symmetry in the k@xmath6hler potential , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is a real parameter , protects it from obtaining the exponential growth of the scalar potential .",
    "explicitly , the scalar potential includes a term like @xmath64 \\ni   3 h^2 m_g^2 \\exp\\left ( \\frac{2({\\rm re } \\phi)^2}{m_g^2}\\right),\\ ] ] where @xmath65 this potential has a vacuum at @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the effective real scalar degree of freedom of the higgs field @xmath16 . around this minimum ,",
    "the higgs fields have a mass of @xmath68 and massive gauge bosons acquire a mass of @xmath69 .    .",
    "charge assignments on superfields in the model under the @xmath56-symmetry and @xmath57-symmetry . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     let us summarize the results of this section for the model given by ( [ kahler ] ) and ( [ super ] ) .",
    "i ) the case of @xmath70 gev is incompatible with the standard cosmological scenario because monopoles would overclose the universe .",
    "note that it is possible to dilute monopoles by some late - time entropy production processes , which can be verified by future gravitational wave experiments  @xcite such as decigo  @xcite or bbo  @xcite .",
    "ii ) the case of @xmath71 gev is the most interesting and the flux of monopoles may be within the reach of icecube  @xcite , depending on the choice of @xmath10 and @xmath72 .",
    "iii ) in the case of @xmath73 gev , monopoles are diluted during inflation sufficiently and there are no significant effects on cosmology . as a result ,",
    "if the planck satellite  @xcite or other b - mode measurements should favor chaotic inflation , the symmetry breaking scale would be constrained .",
    "thus far , we have studied general features of phase transitions during f - term ( chaotic ) inflation .",
    "then , a natural question is whether this mechanism can be embedded in specific models of susy guts . in this section",
    ", we comment on this issue using some realistic gut models .",
    "we also note that in some symmetry breaking patterns , not only monopoles but also domain walls could be produced and the constraint would become severer than our estimate in the previous section .",
    "one of the simplest candidates of susy gut is an @xmath2 model  @xcite . in this model",
    ", we can realize the symmetry breaking @xmath74 by introducing an adjoint higgs multiplet @xmath53 and assume a superpotential , such as @xmath75 however , this model turns out to have separated minima with different gauge symmetries , namely , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . in our scenario ,",
    "higgs field can fall into both of the minima .",
    "these minima are topologically disconnected and hence domain walls should be formed as well as monopoles .",
    "thus we do not have a consistent cosmological evolution scenario in this case , unless the symmetry breaking occurs well before the comoving hubble scale today left the hubble radius during inflation .",
    "thus we can not hope to detect magnetic monopoles .    on the other hand , the pati - salam model  @xcite , @xmath78 , which is broken by two higgs multiplets , @xmath79 and @xmath80 , is applicable in our scenario .",
    "the superpotential is given by @xmath81 this model has a @xmath82 vacuum at @xmath83 . for these fields",
    ", there are only three degree of freedom in the d - flat direction .",
    "therefore , the pattern of symmetry breaking is unique . during the course of this phase transition ,",
    "monopole production is inevitable and hence our scenario discussed in the previous section can be applied .",
    "it would be interesting to seek for other models with the same symmetry breaking property and investigate their phenomenology .",
    "this is left for future study .",
    "in this paper , we have studied phase transition driven by hubble - induced mass in supersymmetric f - term inflation models .",
    "we have found that in supersymmetric f - term inflation models the breaking scale of gut and other intermediate symmetry group , which is associated with the production of monopoles and domain walls , are constrained to be larger than the hubble scale during inflation , because the hubble - induced mass inevitably arises in supersymmetric f - term inflation models  @xcite .",
    "if future cmb observations such as planck  @xcite , quiet+polarbear @xcite or litebird @xcite will detect the @xmath11-mode polarization and determine the inflation energy scale , we can directly constrain the symmetry breaking scale . as a concrete example , we have focused on the chaotic inflation model because its energy scale is rather close to the gut scale and we studied the monopole production in detail .",
    "we have obtained constraints on the symmetry breaking scale in order for the monopole abundance produced during the course of inflation not to contradict with observational bounds .",
    "if the symmetry breaking takes place close to the end of chaotic inflation , future experiments such as icecube  @xcite may be able to discover the signatures of monopoles .",
    "we have opened a new window to constrain gut or other unified theories by considering the phase transition during inflation .",
    "this study relates the cmb observations to the experiments dedicated for direct detection of monopoles . as a theoretical issue",
    ", it may be interesting to investigate phenomenological aspects of concrete gut models such as the pati - salam model  @xcite in the light of our suggestions .",

    "<S> in f - term supergravity inflation models , scalar fields other than the inflaton generically receive a hubble - induced mass , which may restore gauge symmetries during inflation and phase transitions may occur during or after inflation as the hubble parameter decreases . </S>",
    "<S> we study monopole ( and domain wall ) production associated with such a phase transition in chaotic inflation in supergravity and obtain a severe constraint on the symmetry breaking scale which is related with the tensor - to - scalar ratio . depending on model parameters , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible that monopoles are sufficiently diluted to be free from current constraints but still observable by planned experiments .    </S>",
