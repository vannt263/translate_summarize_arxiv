    "ngc  6302 is a massive planetary nebula ( pn ) with a dense circumstellar disk .",
    "estimations of the mass of the ionised nebula ( @xmath2  m@xmath3 @xcite ) and the high nebular abundance of nitrogen @xcite are consistent with it s type i status and imply a massive progenitor @xcite .",
    "the nebula shows a strongly bipolar morphology with a massive equatorial disk , the density of which is sufficient to completely obscure the unobserved central star @xcite .",
    "infrared spectroscopy of the central region of ngc  6302 has shown many emission lines from high - ionisation species , in particular that of [ si  ix ]  3.934  @xmath4 m @xcite , the highest ionisation species found in a pn , as well as lines of [ mg  viii ] and [ al  vi ] .",
    "these observations point towards a very hot central star with estimates of the surface temperature of up to 430,000  k @xcite .",
    "ngc  6302 has a large dust component calculated to have a total mass of 0.05  -  0.05  m@xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the iso spectrum of ngc  6302 @xcite also shows a wealth of emission features from crystalline dust species , including crystalline silicates @xcite , crystalline water ice @xcite and the first extra - solar identification of carbonate features @xcite . despite the large number of oxygen - rich solid state species detected ,",
    "bands attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pah ) have been detected @xcite , usually indicative of carbon - rich material .",
    "this dichotomy between o - rich and c - rich material makes ngc  6302 an important case in stellar evolution . only by compiling a fully three - dimensional photoionisation model of ngc  6302",
    "can a full understanding of this enigmatic object be possible .",
    "mocassin is a 3d photoionisation code that uses monte carlo techniques to solve the thermal equilibrium and ionisation balance equations across an entire grid of arbitrary geometry and density distribution @xcite .",
    "the code allows multiple non - central ionising sources , multiple gas chemistries and has a full dust model incorporating all the gas - dust coupled processes @xcite .",
    "the 3-dimensional nebula model was constructed by fitting the optical emission - line spectrum , particularly the density- and temperature - sensitive line ratios .",
    "the chosen optical emission - line spectrum was that of tsamis et al .",
    "( 2003 ) @xcite , a deep optical spectrum made with a fixed slit that mocassin can simulate when producing model line fluxes for comparison with observations .",
    "the ir spectrum was taken from the iso lws analysis of liu et al .",

    "( 2000 ) @xcite .",
    "we started our models with an hourglass - shaped bipolar nebula with dimensions determined from observations of the nebula and the recently derived distance of 1.04  kpc @xcite .",
    "this was complemented by a thin circumstellar disk with a radial density dependence @xcite .",
    "from there we varied the free parameters to achieve a best fit to the observations .",
    "figure  [ imagenebula ] shows an image of the model nebula showing the diffuse bipolar lobes and the dense circumstellar disk .",
    "the nebula lobes are filled and at a constant density of 1000  @xmath5 , while the circumstellar disk follows a radial density dependence , @xmath6 , which rises to a density of 700,000  @xmath5 at the inner edge of the disk .",
    "the dimensions of the bipolar lobes and the disk are given in table  [ dimensions ] .",
    "figure  [ lineresults ] shows the current best fit model results for some of the density- and temperature - sensitive line ratios from the optical and ir line spectra . to achieve this fit ,",
    "a high density contrast between the diffuse bipolar lobes and the dense circumstellar disk was required .",

    "our good fits to both these line ratios show that our extreme densities are a viable method of reproducing the wide range of density - diagnostic line ratios measured in ngc  6302 .",
    "binette & casassus ( 1999 ) @xcite measure electron densities of @xmath8  @xmath5 and @xmath9  @xmath5 from the density diagnostic line ratios [ ne  v ]  24.3  @xmath4m/14.3  @xmath4 m and [ ar  v ]  13.1  @xmath4m/7.91  @xmath4 m respectively .",
    "the latter of which is a good density diagnostic in the range 10,000 - 300,000  @xmath5 and is highlighting the extremely high densities in the circumstellar disk which we have modelled and also achieve a good match for .    the derived density structure that offers us the best fit to the observations leads us to a total nebula mass of 0.428  m@xmath3 , with approximately 40  % of the mass in the circumstellar disk .",
    "this disk mass of 0.160  m@xmath3 is far short of the 3  m@xmath3 derived by matsuura et al .",
    "( 2005 ) from dust masses from the infrared sed and using a dust - to - gas ratio of 0.01 .",
    "it should be noted that our model masses are only those that are necessary to reproduce the observations , and that , because the disk is optically thick when viewed radially , we are obviously underestimating this mass by potentially an order of magnitude . if the outer radius of the disk is extended to @xmath10  cm ( increasing the mass by a factor of 5.0 ) we find no appreciable difference in the produced spectrum , indicating that large amounts of neutral or molecular material could be hidden within the disk , without affecting the ionisation structure of the nebula .",

    "this is mainly due to a lack of spatial information on the gas properties but also because of the importance of compiling as simple a model as possible .",

    "of all the high - ionisation lines observed , those of mg@xmath18 and si@xmath19 @xcite are of the highest stages and , if predominantly photo - ionised , will put a strong constraint on the high - energy end of the ionising spectrum .",
    "the first observations of ir coronal lines in ngc  6302 were the prominent [ si  vi ] and [ si  vii ] lines @xcite .",
    "previous attempts with one - dimensional photoionisation codes have been unable to accurately reproduce these lines @xcite leading to suggestions that these lines may arise from collisionally - excited material @xcite .",
    "many of the arguments for shock - excited material originated from the observation of @xmath20500  kms@xmath21 wings on the [ ne  v ]  @xmath223426 line @xcite .",

    "we have used both the solar abundance models that incorporate all elements up to nickel , and the hydrogen - deficient models which use `` typical '' pg  1159 abundance ratios of he : c : n : o  =  33:50:2:15 by mass . for both of these",
    "we have varied both the effective temperature and the gravity of the central star in attempting to fit the coronal lines .",
    "we also varied certain nebula parameters such as the disk density and height , that might effect the ionisation structures of these elements .",
    "our models reveal that the majority of the nebula parameters have little effect on these highly - ionised ions .",
    "the effective temperature of the central star has by far the strongest influence on the ionisation structure , yet by using a solar abundance model we were unable to reproduce the highest ionisation stages without reaching temperatures in excess of 400,000  k , where many of the model atmosphere calculations may not be applicable @xcite . even at lower temperatures ,",
    "the ionisation structure that a solar abundance atmosphere creates does not allow accurate reproduction of even the lower - ionisation lines .",
    "this can be seen in table  [ highlines ] for the ionisation structures of magnesium and silicon , where the lower ionisation lines ( from mg@xmath23 and si@xmath24 ) are over - predicted , while no flux is seen in the high - ionisation lines ( from mg@xmath18 and si@xmath19 ) .    however , models using h - deficient central star atmospheres produced ionisation structures that matched the observations much better and were able to reproduce the highest ionisation lines at much lower temperatures ( see table  [ highlines ] ) .",
    "order of magnitude matches can be obtained for nearly all the lines using a 220,000  k model atmosphere , reproducing the ionisation structures of these elements much better .    .observed and modelled line strengths for the high - ionisation ir coronal lines of ngc  6302 .",

    "this can be seen in figure  [ atmos ] where we show the spectral energy distributions of a solar - abundance and a hydrogen - deficient stellar atmosphere .",
    "the ionisation potentials of mg@xmath26 ( 225ev ) and si@xmath18 ( 303ev ) , are also indicated , and it can be seen that a hydrogen - deficient stellar atmosphere has a significantly higher flux at these energies than a solar - abundance stellar atmosphere .",

    "mocassin has a complete dust model , with the dust competing with the gas for uv photons and interacting directly with it via gas - grain collisions @xcite .",
    "it allows any mix of dust species and grain sizes in multiple density distributions .",
    "ngc  6302 is bright in the infrared and the dust distribution has beeen shown to be complex @xcite , with the overall broad shape of the sed indicating a large range of dust temperatures .",
    "these two factors make it important to model the dust using a full 3-dimensional dust radiative transfer code such as mocassin .",
    "we have initially used a model with a single dust species using the astronomical silicates model of draine ( 2003 ) , which includes optical constants covering the full wavelength range of x - rays to the sub - mm @xcite . in a full treatment of the radiative transfer of dust",
    "it is important to have a continuous coverage of optical constants to accurately treat the absorption by the grains of uv photons and the re - emission in the ir .",
    "we started with a simple mrn grain - size distribution using a@xmath28 m and a@xmath29 m and a slope of @xmath30 .",
    "we found however that a better fit could be obtained with larger grains and a shallow slope , producing more larger grains and less small grains .",
    "figure  [ sedfit ] shows our current single - species fit to the iso sed .",
    "this fit to the sed uses a power - law grain size distribution with a@xmath31 m and a@xmath32 m with a slope of @xmath33 .",
    "the presence of large grains up to @xmath34 m in size has been implied from the sub - mm continuum @xcite and the presence of such a dense circumstellar disk provides a stable environment where such large grains could be built up .",
    "a better fit to the shape of the sed could be gained by modelling two separate populations of dust grains , one consisting of large grains in the circumstellar disk and the other with a more standard grain - size distribution that might exist in the bipolar lobes of the nebula .",
    "the inclusion of multiple grain distributions , with different grain sizes and different chemistries in separate 3-dimensional density distributions is a unique and versatile feature of mocassin and will allow the observations of ngc  6302 to be much more accurately reproduced and studied .",
    "the iso spectrum of ngc  6302 @xcite also shows a wealth of emission features from crystalline dust species , including crystalline silicates @xcite and crystalline water ice @xcite .",
    "two previously unidentified features at 62 and 90  @xmath4 m were also identified as belonging to the carbonates calcite and dolomite @xcite , though it is thought that carbonates might not be able to form in these environments @xcite .",
    "we are in the process of compiling a full database of dust species suitable for use in photoionisation and radiative transfer codes such as mocassin .",
    "we intend to gather optical constants for all dust species that have been observed in ngc  6302 or could possibly exist in such environments and attempt to reproduce the detailed emission features seen in the iso spectrum .",
    "a fit to the spectral energy distribution will allow us to derive dust masses for all the species present and also determine if the oxygen - rich and carbon - rich species are spatially separate , as some evolutionary scenarios have suggested .",
    "we have presented initial results from our three - dimensional photoionisation and dust radiative transfer model of ngc  6302 using the 3d photoionisation code mocassin .",
    "our fit to the emission - line spectra has resulted in a high density contrast between a large pair of diffuse bipolar lobes and a thin circumstellar disk where densities reach @xmath35  @xmath5 .",
    "this density distribution supports the multiple density diagnostics of ngc  6302 that cover a large range of densities .",
    "our fit to the infrared coronal lines comes using a @xmath0  k hydrogen - deficient stellar atmosphere model .",
    "this is one of the lowest temperatures derived for the unseen central star of this object , which is only possible using a hydrogen - deficient central star model , implying that the central star of ngc  6302 may have undergone some sort of late thermal pulse .",
    "our dust model includes a fit to the overall shape of the sed using a dust grain size distribution that extends up to @xmath1 m .",
    "the future inclusion of multiple crystalline silicate species in separate dust density distributions will allow us to reproduce the iso spectrum and determine chemical properties of the dust grains around this object . these and other discoveries are helping to unveil many interesting properties of this interesting object .",
