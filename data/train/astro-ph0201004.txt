    "observations of co line emission from high redshift ( @xmath0 ) galaxies has become an important diagnostic tool in the study of galaxy formation .",
    "such studies include observations of ir - luminous starburst galaxies selected at ir and ( sub)mm wavelengths ( brown & van den bout 1992 ; solomon , downes & radford 1992 ; frayer et al .  1998 ; ivison et al .",
    "2001 ) , and active galaxies ( qsos and radio galaxies ) selected at optical wavelengths ( omont et al .  1996a , b , 2001 ; ohta et al .  1996 ; barvainis et al",
    "1998 ; guilloteau et al .",
    "1997 , 1999 ; papadopoulos et al .",
    "2000 , 2001 ; carilli , menten & yun 1999 ; carilli et al .",
    "due to the sensitivity limitations of current mm - wave telescopes , such studies have been limited to extreme high mass , high luminosity galaxies , corresponding to galaxies with far - ir ( fir ) luminosities : @xmath2 l@xmath3 , and molecular gas masses : @xmath4 m@xmath3 . while such systems are rare in the nearby universe , @xmath5 mpc@xmath6 , or 10@xmath7 times lower than @xmath8 galaxies , ( sub)mm surveys suggest that the comoving number density of such objects increases by up to three orders of magnitude by @xmath9 to 3 ( smail , ivison & blain 1997 ; blain et al .",
    "1999 ; barger et al .",
    "another serious limitation to current instruments is the narrow bandwidth of the spectrometers .",
    "current spectrometers have maximum bandwidths of 0.5 to 1 ghz , corresponding to 1500 to 3000 km s@xmath10 at 100 ghz .",
    "the limited sensitivity and bandwidth of existing instruments effectively preclude large - volume searches for high-@xmath0 galaxies via their molecular line emission .",
    "the next generation of mm- and cm - wave telescopes will have sensitivities and bandwidths at least an order of magnitude better than existing instruments . with such capabilities",
    "it becomes feasible to consider searches for high-@xmath0 galaxies at mm and cm wavelengths .",
    "this problem has already been addressed in detail for ( sub)mm - wave observations using the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) , the next - generation mm - wave telescope ( blain et al .",
    "2000  paper i ; blain 1996 , 2001 ; van der werf & israel 1996 ; silk & spaans 1997 ; combes , maoli , & omont 1999 ; gnedin , silk & spaans 2001 ) .",
    "this paper dramatically expands the discussion in paper i of the capabilities of future telescopes to study the evolution of dusty star forming galaxies via their low - excitation molecular line emission . in paper",
    "i , formalism was developed to investigate optimal molecular line surveys which maximize the detection rate of galaxies for a given amount of observing time , and the analysis presented herein relies on the same formalism .",
    "the importance of such surveys is delineated in detail in paper i. to summarize , measuring molecular lines , and especially the low - excitation lines that trace the bulk of gas in the interstellar medium ( ism ) , provides a direct probe of the massive gas reservoirs required to fuel star formation in nascent galaxies .",
    "in addition , the velocity width of the lines provides an estimate of the dynamical mass of the systems .",
    "observations of the infrared background , and source counts at ( sub)mm wavelengths , suggest that a substantial fraction of the star formation that occurs in the universe is invisible at optical wavelengths due to dust obscuration ( blain et al.1999 ) .",
    "future molecular line surveys may be the only way of obtaining a complete census of the redshift distribution of this cosmic star formation .",
    "paper i emphasized the capabilities of future mm - wave telescopes , such as the alma , for discovering high redshift galaxies via their co emission .",
    "the focus of the analysis presented herein is on future cm - wave telescopes , such as the square kilometer array ( ska ) and the expanded very large array ( evla ) , for observing low - excitation co molecular line emission from high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the important difference between mm- and cm - wave observations is that mm - wave telescopes are limited to studying higher order co transitions from high-@xmath0 galaxies ",
    "co(3 - 2 ) or higher at 100ghz for @xmath11  while cm - wave telescopes probe the lower order transitions , co(2 - 1 ) and co(1 - 0 ) .",
    "clearly such complementarity is critical for determining excitation conditions in high-@xmath0 molecular gas clouds .",
    "in particular , mm - wave surveys of high order transitions will be biased toward high - density , high - temperature gas , with @xmath12cm@xmath6 and @xmath14k ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2001 ; papadopoulos & ivison 2001 ) .",
    "an important advantage of cm - wave surveys is the large fractional bandwidth and primary beam area . at high redshifts",
    "cm - wave spectroscopy will be able to map out the 3-dimensional spatial structure of line - emitting galaxies , and thus to trace directly the build up of large - scale structure in the universe .",
    "both the thickness in redshift , and the projected area on the sky of the surveyed volume , will be much greater in the cm waveband than at mm wavelengths .",
    "it is also likely that low - excitation lines will map out a larger fraction of the volume of the ism in these galaxies , and thus provide the opportunity to study in detail the spatially resolved kinematic structure of most of the gas in the ism in high - redshift galaxies , which resides in the cold phase .",
    "these observations would provide information about both the evolution of the masses of galaxy disks and the disruption of disks by galaxy interactions at large redshifts .",
    "this will allow valuable new tests of understanding of the assembly and formation of galaxies .",
    "we use the latest galaxy evolution models from paper i , modified to take account of additional data and revised cosmology .",
    "while these models represent perhaps the best current estimates of the evolution of dusty star forming galaxies , the observational constraints are such that substantial revisions , especially of the source redshift distribution , are certainly possible .",
    "likewise , the design specifications of the next - generation cm - wave telescopes are still being considered .",
    "hence , this paper is not meant as a definitive and final prediction of the results of future molecular line surveys with cm - wave telescopes , but merely to advocate the possibilities .",
    "a particular concrete question we hope to address is : what choices in the design of such telescopes ( eg .",
    "high frequency limit , maximum baseline ) will facilitate the study of molecular line emission from high-@xmath0 galaxies ?",
    "we assume h@xmath15 = 65 km s@xmath10 mpc@xmath10 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17",
    "the models we employ for predicting co source counts are updated from paper i. these models employ an analytic description of pure luminosity evolution of the low-@xmath0 _ iras _",
    "60-@xmath18 m luminosity function ( saunders et al .  1990 ) .",
    "the evolution function has the form , @xmath19 \\ , { \\rm cosh}^2 c.\\ ] ] at very low and very high redshifts the function can be approximated by @xmath20 , with @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively . with the current cosmology , and taking into account all available far - ir and ( sub)-mm background , count and redshift distribution data , the values @xmath23 and @xmath24 are required , if a typical dust temperature of 37k is assumed .",
    "the fitting procedures and details of the information used are explained in blain et al .",
    "a plot of this function is shown in fig.1 of blain ( 2002 ) .",
    "the evolution peaks at @xmath25 , at which the bolometric luminosity density of infrared - luminous galaxies is about 40 times greater than at @xmath26 .",
    "the strength of the emission from co lines is calculated as described in paper i. excitation conditions , and thus line ratios , are derived from a standard large velocity gradient model ( frayer & brown 1997 ) with a kinetic temperature of about 50k and a density of 10@xmath27cm@xmath6 .",
    "this model provides a reasonable description of the co emission from two well - studied fir - luminous galaxies at @xmath28 , and their properties are used to normalize the co emission line strengths to the evolving bolometric luminosity function of galaxies described above .",
    "table1 lists the assumed parameters for telescope capabilities for the ska , evla , and alma .",
    "columns 2 and 3 give the antenna diameter and the instantaneous frequency range covered , respectively .",
    "column 4 gives the effective aperture ( total collecting area @xmath29 aperture efficiency ) divided by the system temperature , and column 5 gives the field of view ( fov ) of the primary elements at the given frequencies .",
    "column 6 gives the rms sensitivity in 1 hour for a fwhm spectral channel of 300kms@xmath10 .",
    "the design for the ska , including the primary stations for the array , the correlator , and the frequency range covered , is still under investigation . for the analysis below we adopt the united states ska consortium design concept of a square kilometer of collecting area comprised of small ( 7 m ) diameter antennas , arranged in 1000 stations of 26 antennas per station ( cordes , preston , & tarter 2001 ) .",
    "we assume the elements in each station are closely packed ( @xmath30 1 m separation ) , implying an effective station diameter of about 40 m .",
    "beam - forming correlators generate ` effective beams ' at each station corresponding roughly to the diffraction limited beam of a 40 m diameter antenna .",
    "signals from these effective beams are then cross correlated with the corresponding beams of other stations .",
    "the current specifications for the ska require imaging of the full primary beam of the 7 m elements , thereby requiring roughly @xmath31 = 33 beams per station .",
    "the number of cross correlations ( per polarization and lag channel ) required for this type of a system is then the sum of the number of cross correlations between stations @xmath32 , plus the number of cross correlations per station ( ie .",
    "the beam - forming correlator ) @xmath33 , for a total of @xmath34 cross correlations .",
    "this value is an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath35 cross correlations required in the case of full cross correlation of the 26000 7 m elements .",
    "the trade - offs between full cross correlation and beam forming instruments are in imaging fidelity , which is not a critical issue for the co searches discussed herein , and in calibration flexibility , ie .",
    "the difficulty and complexity is shifted from the construction of the large correlator required for full cross correlation to ensuring the stability of the many beam - forming correlators .",
    "the analysis discussed below is not critically dependent on the specific design of the array stations , except with respect to the imaging fov . for a fixed collecting area",
    "a large fov is clearly preferable for surveys , as the source detection rate increases linearly with fov .",
    "an important point is the high - frequency limit of the ska .",
    "the current straw - man design has a maximum frequency of 22ghz .",
    "however , weinreb & bagri ( 2001 ) have shown that going to higher frequencies may be feasible , both in terms of the antennas and the receivers . in this paper",
    "we consider co line searches in a 43-ghz band in addition to the standard 22-ghz band .",
    "one of the main motivations of this paper is to gauge the scientific advantages of going to higher frequency with future large area cm telescopes .",
    "such information is required for proper understanding of the trade - offs between scientific capability and cost .",
    "we assume a 4-ghz instantaneous total bandwidth , and a 22-ghz aperture efficiency that is a factor two less than that at 5ghz , ie . a ` half - ska ' .",
    "the evla is included in the analysis since it represents the nearer - term capabilities for cm - wave high-@xmath0 co surveys .",
    "the evla represents a major step forward in the study of low - order high-@xmath0 molecular lines in a number of ways .",
    "first , through improved receivers and antenna structures the evla will be about twice as sensitive as the current vla at 43ghz for spectral line observations .",
    "second , the current vla correlator is limited to only a 50-mhz bandwidth with 7 spectral channels , which corresponds to only 350kms@xmath10 at 43ghz . such a narrow band",
    "both precludes searches for high-@xmath0 co emission and provides very limited spectral information ( carilli et al .",
    "the evla will have an 8-ghz bandwidth in two polarizations with 16000 spectral channels .",
    "third , the current vla high - frequency bands are limited to 20.525  ghz and 4049ghz .",
    "the evla will have continuous frequency coverage from 1 to 50ghz .",
    "the alma is included as a standard of comparison for future ( sub)mm telescopes ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "for both the evla and the alma we consider the optimum bands for co searches ( 40 and 230ghz , respectively ) . note that the sensitivity of the evla at 43 ghz is comparable to that expected for alma at 43 ghz  the larger collecting area of the evla is off - set by the higher aperture efficiency and better observing site for alma .",
    "the inclusion of a 43 ghz system for alma is currently under debate . if such a system is included , then the sensitivity for the evla in table 1 is essentially that expected for the alma at this frequency , while the alma will have a factor four larger fov",
    ".    arrays of heterodyne receivers on large single dish telescopes offer a potentially competitive method for performing wide field molecular line surveys . in order to sample the same area of the sky with a single dish relative to an interferometer",
    "the number of independent single dish beams that need to be sampled is given by the ratio of the fov of the interferometer to that of the single dish .",
    "for example , the 100-m green bank telescope and the evla have similar collecting areas , so a 16 element receiver array on the gbt will survey a similar area of the sky as the evla with comparable sensitivity . a similar size receiver array on the 50-m large millimeter telescope ( lmt ) will sample the same fov as the alma , with about 25@xmath1 of the sensitivity . of course , a wide - band autocorrelation spectrometer will be required for each element of the receiver array .",
    "the telescope optics in both cases ( the gbt and the lmt ) will support such receiver arrays , since both telescopes have been designed to support large format ( @xmath36 ) bolometer cameras .",
    "as a metric of the capabilities of the different telescopes we use the detection rate for an ` optimal survey ' . the optimal survey balances area surveyed versus sensitivity to sample the source counts at the ` knee ' of the distribution , corresponding to the regime where @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the flux in the line ( see paper i for details ) .",
    "this criterion maximizes the number of sources detected in a given observing time .    in fig.1",
    "we show the predicted 22- and 43-ghz line source counts for a 4-ghz bandwidth using the formalism for infrared - selected galaxy evolution developed in paper i. the line counts increase approximately linearly with bandwidth .",
    "table 2 lists the frequency ranges and optimal depths for the different telescopes , as well as the number of pointings per hour for the optimal depth and the detection rate of high-@xmath0 co - emitting galaxies . for the baseline specification of a 22 ghz high frequency upper limit , the ska galaxy detection rate will be a factor two larger than that of the alma .",
    "if the high frequency limit is increased to 43 ghz , then the ska becomes the pre - eminent instrument for discovering high redshift galaxies via their co emission , detecting 100 s of galaxies per hour .",
    "the evla is clearly much slower than the ska in terms of discovering high redshift galaxies due to its lower sensitivity and smaller fov .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the line surveys at different frequencies are sampling different co transitions at different redshifts . in fig.2",
    "we delineate the detection rates in terms of the different transitions and redshifts .",
    "surveys with the ska at 22ghz to the optimal depth of @xmath39wm@xmath40 detect almost exclusively the co(1 - 0 ) line from galaxies with @xmath41l@xmath3 at @xmath42 . at 43ghz at the optimal depth of @xmath43wm@xmath40 , about 92% of the detections are co(1 - 0 ) lines from galaxies with @xmath44wm@xmath40 at @xmath25 , with about 7.5@xmath1 being co(2 - 1 ) lines from galaxies with @xmath45 at @xmath46 , and perhaps 0.5% of the detections being co(3 - 2 ) emission from galaxies with similar fir luminosity but at @xmath47 , if such galaxies exist .",
    "surveys with the alma at 230ghz to the optimal depth of @xmath48wm@xmath40 are dominated by galaxies with @xmath49l@xmath3 , at @xmath50 to 2 , emitting co(4 - 3 ) to co(6 - 5 ) , with a minor contribution from galaxies with @xmath51l@xmath3 at @xmath52 emitting co(3 - 2 ) and from more - luminous galaxies with @xmath53l@xmath3 emitting co(7 - 6 ) at @xmath28 .",
    "the alma can also potentially detect a comparable number of redshifted fine - structure lines from higher redshifts in this band ( paper i ) .",
    "we consider briefly a few issues relating to the cm - wave study of co emission from high redshift galaxies , including : ( i ) maximum baselines for the array given the expected brightness temperatures , ( ii ) the capabilities of studying large scale structure through optimal surveys , and ( iii ) contamination of such surveys by emission from hcn  the next strongest thermal molecular emission species in the relevant frequency range .",
    "an important issue when considering detecting thermal emission from high redshift galaxies with future cm telescopes is the maximum baselines dictated by the intrinsic brightness temperature of the emission .",
    "the expected ( rest - frame ) brightness temperature for the co emission from high-@xmath0 galaxies is likely to be @xmath54 k. this corresponds to an observed brightness temperature of @xmath55 k for a source at @xmath56 .",
    "the peak flux density of the line for the optimal 43-ghz survey corresponds to about 0.2mjy for the ska . in order not to spatially over - resolve the sources , much of the collecting area of the array",
    "must then be on baselines @xmath57 km , corresponding to @xmath58 resolution at 43 ghz .",
    "the second issue is large scale structure .",
    "the large number of galaxies discovered over a relatively narrow redshift range for sensitive molecular line surveys at cm wavelengths has the added benefit of facilitating three - dimensional studies of large - scale structure at moderate and high redshifts .",
    "operating at 2024ghz , the optimal ska survey with a station diameter of 7 m detects co(1 - 0 ) emission from about 360 galaxies in 24hours .",
    "these galaxies are in the redshift range @xmath59 to 4.75 over an area of 3.5deg@xmath60 , corresponding to a comoving volume of 0.044gpc@xmath61 . at the higher frequency of 40 - 44ghz , the co(1 - 0 ) emission from about 4200 galaxies would be detected in 24hours from @xmath62 to 1.88 over an area of 23deg@xmath60 and a comoving volume of 0.085gpc@xmath61 .",
    "a volume of about 0.1gpc@xmath61 corresponds to a representative volume of the universe , and so these surveys will provide excellent probes of large - scale structure .",
    "the geometries of both of these daily survey volumes are only about five times deeper than they are wide .",
    "this should ensure that three - dimensional large - scale structure is sampled reliably .",
    "the space density of co - emitting galaxies is expected to be about 100 times lower than for optically - selected , spectroscopically - confirmed lyman - break galaxies ( steidel et al .",
    "1999 ) , and about 10 times less than submm - selected galaxies ( blain et al .",
    "however , the geometry of the three - dimensional redshift surveys should make low - excitation co surveys an ideal tracer of large - scale structure .",
    "in particular , as the co line surveys sample higher luminosity galaxies , their clustering strength relative to the dark matter at high redshift might be stronger than for lower luminosity galaxies in standard hierarchical galaxy formation models ( davis et al . 1985 ) .",
    "whether this is true will provide important new information about bias and the galaxy formation process , especially as mass measurements will be available for comparison from co line widths and excitation ratios .",
    "finally there is the issue of hcn emission .",
    "solomon et al . (",
    "1997 ) have shown a non - linear relationship between @xmath63(co(1 - 0 ) ) ( in k km s@xmath10 pc@xmath60 ) and @xmath64 for galaxies in the sense that high @xmath64 galaxies have lower values of @xmath63(co(1 - 0 ) ) than would be expected based on a linear relationship .",
    "considering @xmath64 to be a measure of star formation rate , and @xmath63(co(1 - 0 ) ) to be a measure of molecular gas mass , this would imply an increase in star formation efficiency ( @xmath65 ) with increasing luminosity , in particular for galaxies with @xmath64 @xmath66 l@xmath3 ( solomon et al . 1997 ) .",
    "for dense nuclear starbursts a number of groups ( solomon et al . 1997 ; mao et al .",
    "2000 ; weiss et al .",
    "2001 ) have shown that the densities are such that the entire interstellar medium in the starburst regions may be molecular , and that the co(1 - 0 ) emission may be dominated by this molecular inter - cloud medium , as opposed to being from the denser star forming clouds themselves .",
    "in this situation it appears that higher density molecular tracers , such as hcn , which has a critical density of order @xmath67 cm@xmath6 , may be a better probe of the star forming clouds themselves .",
    "gao & solomon ( 2001 ) show that the relationship between @xmath63(hcn(1 - 0 ) ) and @xmath64 remains linear , with @xmath68 over the range : @xmath69 l@xmath3 to @xmath70 l@xmath3 ( see solomon 2001 ) .",
    "given this linear relationship , and the non - linear relationship between @xmath64 and @xmath63(co(1 - 0 ) ) , the ratio : @xmath71 varies from about 0.025 for galaxies with @xmath64 = 10@xmath72 l@xmath3 to 0.10 for @xmath64 = 10@xmath73 l@xmath3 .    in order to estimate the contamination of optimal cm - wave co surveys by hcn emission , we have included the hcn(1 - 0 ) ( 88.6 ghz rest frequency ) emission in the galaxy formation models discussed in section 2 . at the most efficient depths for the co searches , we find that the number of hcn(1 - 0 ) detections would be about 5@xmath1 of the total number of co(1 - 0 ) lines at 22 ghz and about 1.5@xmath1 of the total number of lines at 43 ghz .",
    "this emission would correspond to galaxies with @xmath64 @xmath74 l@xmath3 at @xmath75 for the 22 ghz survey , and similar luminosity galaxies at @xmath50 for the 43 ghz survey .",
    "hence , hcn emission should not present a major confusion problem for such optimal cm - wave co line searches . on the other hand",
    ", we also find that the fractional contamination by hcn is likely to increase with the depth of the survey , eg .",
    "a 22-ghz survey to a depth of @xmath76 w m@xmath40 will contain about 20@xmath1 hcn(1 - 0 ) lines .",
    "from table1 and fig.2 , it can been seen that future large area cm - wave telescopes operating at 22 ghz will be competitive with future mm - wave telescopes in terms of discovering high-@xmath0 star - forming galaxies through their molecular line emission .",
    "increasing the high frequency limit to 43-ghz allows for optimal surveys which are 20 times faster than the alma in terms of discovering high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "detection rates are a simplistic metric for the alma and the ska , and it is important to emphasize their complementarity .",
    "alma surveys will be dominated by higher - order co lines from intermediate redshift ( @xmath77 ) , intermediate luminosity ( l@xmath78 l@xmath3 ) objects .",
    "surveys with the ska at 22 ghz will be dominated by low - order transitions from higher luminosity ( l@xmath79 l@xmath3 ) galaxies at higher redshifts ( @xmath80 ) .    for the evla at 43 ghz the combined small",
    "fov and low sensitivity make it a much slower survey instrument that either the alma and ska .",
    "however , the evla has adequate sensitivity to resolve and study at sub - arcsec angular resolution the low - order co emission from individual fir - luminous , high-@xmath0 objects selected from wide - field surveys at other wavelengths , such as surveys using ( sub)mm bolometer arrays on large single - dish telescopes . and perhaps most importantly",
    ", the large fractional bandwidth of the evla will allow for redshift determinations via molecular line searches using pointed observations of individual objects .",
    "the evla will thus provide the first look into the nature of low - order co emission from high-@xmath0 galaxies .",
    "the importance of such capabilities has already been demonstrated with the current vla in a few extreme cases , although the limited bandwidth effectively precludes proper spectroscopy ( papadopoulos et al .",
    "2001 ; carilli et al .  1999 , 2002 ) .",
    "the co excitation conditions assumed in the models of section 2 could lead to pessimistic predictions for the low - order transitions because the velocity integrated line flux density increases roughly with the square of the frequency ( ie .",
    "constant brightness temperature ) , at least to co(4 - 3 ) ( paper i ) .",
    "while this appears to be roughly appropriate for infra - red selected galaxy samples , our models do not include the possibility of a population of molecular gas - rich , high redshift galaxies with lower excitation conditions .",
    "for example , the co excitation conditions for the milky way disk inside the solar radius ( excluding the galactic center ) imply roughly equal velocity integrated flux density for co(1 - 0 ) and co(4 - 3 ) ( fixsen , bennett , & mather 1999 ) .",
    "if such a population of galaxies exists , then the predictions from our models can be considered lower limits to the cm - wave source counts for molecular line surveys .",
    "recent observations with the vla provide evidence that such a population may indeed exist ( papadopoulos et al.2001 ) .",
    "limitations to the intrinsic brightness temperature of the thermal line emission from high redshift galaxies require that much of the collecting area of future large area radio telescopes be concentrated on baselines @xmath57 km . on the other hand ,",
    "having baselines out to 10 km provides the important capability of imaging the emission on scales relevant to galaxies ( @xmath81 kpc ) , and for resolving the multiple images of the order of 1% of line - emitting galaxies expected to be gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies .",
    "lastly , we have found that hcn(1 - 0 ) emission will not be a major source of confusion to optimal cm - wave co line searches , comprising about 5@xmath1 of the total number of detected galaxies at 22 ghz and 1.5@xmath1 at 43 ghz . of course , once identified as such , hcn is interesting in it s own regard as a better tracer than co of the star forming clouds in active star forming galaxies ( solomon 2001 ) .    like studies of star formation in our own galaxy ,",
    "it has become clear that a complete census of the star - formation history of the universe requires an understanding of the contribution from galaxies that are obscured by dust at optical wavelengths .",
    "the next generation mm- and cm - wave telescopes will provide unique , and complementary , capabilities for studying the thermal and non - thermal line and continuum emission from such systems at sub - arcsecond spatial resolution .",
    "the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) is operated by associated universities , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "we thank dave frayer for further discussions about the line models implemented in paper i.                                                                                              * figure 1 * : cumulative source counts of 300-km - s@xmath10 wide co lines at 22ghz ( solid line ) and 43ghz ( dash line ) , developed from the results of blain et al .",

    "<S> perhaps more importantly , cm - wave telescopes are sensitive to lower excitation gas in higher redshift galaxies , and so provide a complementary view of conditions in high redshift galaxies to mm - wave surveys . </S>",
    "<S> we have also included in our models emission from hcn . </S>",
    "<S> the number of hcn(1 - 0 ) detections will be about 5@xmath1 of the co detections in the ( co - optimized ) 22 ghz surveys , and about 1.5@xmath1 for 43 ghz surveys . in order not to over - resolve the sources , brightness temperature limitations require that a future large area cm telescopes have much of its collecting area on baselines shorter than 10 km . </S>"
