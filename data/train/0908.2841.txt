    "core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) are inherently asymmetric events , due to the asymmetric nature of the explosion mechanism . probing the shapes of these events can provide , therefore , important clues as to the nature of the explosion mechanism and its influence on the standard photometric and spectroscopic observables used to measure their properties . + thomson scattering is a polarizing process , with the polarization of the photon aligned in the direction orthogonal to the plane of scattering ( i.e. the plane defined by the ingoing and outgoing photon directions and the point of scattering ; @xcite ) . in sne",
    "the principal site for this process is at the photosphere , where the opacity is dominated by free electrons . for a resolved spherical",
    "photosphere the most significant polarization would be seen to arise from the limb , where only a narrow range of scattering angles ( for photons exiting the photosphere and being scattered into the line of sight ) are permissible . for an unresolved spherical photosphere ,",
    "the polarized components arising from regions separated by @xmath5 further around the photosphere are equal but opposite , cancelling out and leading to a zero net observed polarization . in the presence of asymmetries",
    ", there is incomplete cancellation of the polarization components arising from different points in the photosphere , leading to a net observed polarization with the degree of polarization related to the magnitude of the asymmetry and the polarization angle corresponding to the orientation of the asymmetry on the sky ( rotated by @xmath5 ) .",
    "this produces a wavelength-_independent _ continuum polarization .",
    "+ the interaction of continuum photons with the line forming region also produces a wavelength-_dependent _ polarization .",
    "although resonant scattering is inherently depolarizing , absorption along the line of sight removes blue - shifted photons ( leading to the standard absorption component of p cygni profiles ) .",
    "if the line forming region does not equally cover the photosphere , due to some large scale structure or clumping , then unequal contributions of the polarization components arising from the photosphere will be removed , leading to an increase in polarization across the absorption and the so - called _ inverted p - cygni profiles _ in the polarization spectrum @xcite .",
    "the properties of the polarization at the absorption line are related to the distribution of the line forming element about the photosphere .",
    "because photons scattered into the line of sight by resonant scattering are depolarized , the red - shifted emission components are inherently depolarized .",
    "polarimetry provides , therefore , a unique and powerful way of directly measuring the shapes of sne at early , optically thick times .",
    "+ previous polarimetric studies of ccsne have shown that the continua of type ibc sn are generally more polarized at early times than type ii sne .",
    "in addition , the increase in polarization across the absorption features of p  cygni profiles , coupled with the rotation of the polarization , have demonstrated that the geometries of ccsne are not described by just a single global axial symmetry @xcite .",

    "@xcite determined that the xrf was non - relativistic , unlike xrfs associated with the gamma - ray burst phenomenon , rather arising from the shock breakout arising from a sn explosion .",
    "the properties of the xrf suggested it arose from breakout at a radius consistent with a wolf - rayet ( wr ) progenitor star , into a dense wind ( @xmath6 ) . @xcite and @xcite modelled the explosion as spherically symmetric , but both found that sn  2008d was only slightly more energetic than normal type ibc sne ( @xmath7 ) and less energetic than so - called hypernovae ( e.g. sn  2002ap ) .",

    "as has been demonstrated in a number of cases , the determination and subtraction of the isp component is vital to determining the intrinsic polarization ( @xmath44 ) and , hence , geometry of sne .",
    "importantly , the isp can cause intrinsically unpolarized features to be observed to be polarized and make polarized features appear depolarized .",

    "we see that , at the first epoch , the absorption component of ir3 is unpolarized .",
    "furthermore , we note that the general behaviour of the data on the stokes @xmath38 plane is constant with time , occupying the same location ( despite variability in the polarization associated with spectral lines ) . + synthetic v - band polarimetry of this data yielded @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) and @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) , at 31 jan 2008 and 15 feb 2008 respectively .",
    "@xcite present broad v - band polarimetric measurements which , not only agreeing with our synthetic v - band polarimetry , also show that sn  2008d occupies the same location of the @xmath38 plane prior to and following our two observations ( see  [ sec : discussion ] ) .",
    "the determination of the isp is crucial to determining the intrinsic polarization of the sn .",
    "the reddening towards sn  2008d can be used to provide a constraint on the maximum degree of isp .",
    "the total reddening to sn  2008d ( see  [ sec : results : spec ] ) constrains the isp to be @xmath49 ( assuming a standard serkowski - galactic type isp ) , arising predominantly in the host galaxy . in order to make a precise estimate of the isp component",
    "particular assumptions must be used , principally based on there being portions of the spectrum that are intrinsically unpolarized , such that the observed polarization of these regions is due to the isp alone .",
    "we attempt to remove only a single total isp , rather than account for individual isps arising in the galaxy and the host galaxy , as the total isp is a vector sum of all individual components .",
    "a number of techniques , based on this primary assumption , have been used and we discuss in turn the alternative values of the isp indicated .",
    "+ under the assumption that particular wavelength regions of the spectrum are intrinsically depolarized due to the blending of numerous overlapping fe lines in the range 4800 - 5600 , @xcite used the observed polarization properties at particular wavelengths as measures of the isp .",
    "the multiplet 42 lines are clearly resolved at both epochs @xcite , however immediately redward in the range 5200 - 5500  there are a number of overlapping features . under the assumption that the line blanketing opacity dominates over electron scattering in this wavelength range , such that this region is intrinsically depolarized , we measure the median average values of the stokes parameters as @xmath50 and @xmath51 at the first epoch and @xmath52 and @xmath53 at the second epoch .",
    "these values of the isp stokes parameters are identical , within the uncertainties , and the average value corresponds to @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "+ an additional measurement can be derived using the technique of @xcite , under the assumption that the emission component of a p  cygni profile is intrinsically unpolarized .",
    "the polarization of the emission component , corrected for the polarization of the continuum ( actually a mixture of the intrinsic continuum polarization and the isp ) , reflects the isp component alone and can be measured by a least - squares fit to the equations @xmath56 and @xmath57 to determine the stokes parameters of the emission line @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( in the presence of no isp @xmath60 ) .",
    "this technique was applied to the emission components of the @xmath614470 / and ir3 lines at the second epoch , where a good approximation for the continuum level could be made . at the first epoch ,",
    "the emission components of these lines are truncated by blends with other features , whereas at the second epoch these features appear unblended .",
    "the isp component was measured for both lines to be @xmath0 and @xmath62 ( where the quoted error is the scatter in fits using different wavelength ranges and different continuum levels ) .",

    "@xcite observed similar stokes parameters with their broad - band polarimetry , between 3.6 and 78.5 days post - explosion , suggestive that the bulk of the observed polarization ( excluding polarization associated with strong lines ) was due to a unvarying isp .",
    "+ in general , the isp is expected to be wavelength - dependent , but characterising this dependence is difficult for objects such as sn  2008d which show strong intrinsic wavelength - dependent polarization associated with spectral lines . for a serkowski - type isp , for milky way - like dust ,",
    "the difference in isp between the peak polarization , at a characteristic wavelength of @xmath63 , and the isp polarization measured for the emission components of the lines at the blue and red ends of the spectrum is smaller than the error of the measured stokes parameters of the isp .",
    "the small degree of wavelength dependence justifies the use of a single - valued , wavelength independent isp as inferred from this data . for a number of sne , the wavelength - dependence of the isp , arising from their host galaxies ,",
    "has been observed to deviate significantly from a standard @xcite - type isp law @xcite .",
    "in the case of sn  2008d , there is no evidence for the magnitude of the polarization rising significantly at either the blue or red extremes of the observed spectrum ( suggesting the peak in the isp occurs within the wavelength range of these observations ) .",
    "in fact , the baseline polarization of the data is approximately constant across the observed wavelength range , with a possible peak around @xmath63 ( see above ) , which lends further credence to the to the assumption that the isp can be considered approximately wavelength independent for our observations ( with any wavelength dependence of the isp over the wavelength range being smaller than the uncertainties of our wavelength independent estimate ) .",
    "+ the weighted average of the measured stokes parameters for the isp , from the different methods , are @xmath64 and @xmath65 , which correspond to @xmath66 and @xmath67 .",
    "the direction of the isp vector is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig : intro : posisp ] .",
    "contrary to the standard prediction that the isp vector be aligned with the spiral arms of the host galaxy , due to the alignment of dust grains by magnetic field lines parallel to the spiral arm @xcite , the isp is not aligned with the nearest spiral arm .",
    "this may indicate that the isp determined may either be incorrect , that the magnetic field in the host is not aligned with the spiral arms at large radii or that the isp is the sum of a number of separate components , perhaps arising in the galaxy , the host galaxy , the intervening medium and , importantly , in the circumstellar environment of the sn .",
    "+        after correcting the observed data for the isp , we note that away from obvious spectral features the intrinsic polarization is generally @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore , at both epochs the wavelength region @xmath68  appears to have a relatively constant low polarization , with only weak features appearing in the flux spectrum . using this region as representative of the continuum",
    ", we measure the intrinsic polarization to be @xmath69 and @xmath70 at the first and second epochs respectively ( where these values are weighted means over the data in this wavelength range ) . assuming a spheroidal photosphere",

    "significant intrinsic polarization is associated with the lines at both epochs . at the second epoch , higher levels of polarization",
    "are measured for the redder lines , in line with the absorption becoming stronger ( i.e. the fraction of continuum photons being removed by the line is larger at the second epoch ) . if the line forming region , for a general line,1 blocks all the unpolarized light from a spheroidal photosphere , then the maximum degree of polarization expected at absorption minimum ( @xmath73 ) is : @xmath74 following the prescription of @xcite , where @xmath75 is the degree of polarization measured in adjacent `` continuum '' regions and @xmath76 and @xmath77 are the fluxes measured at the nearby continuum and at the absorption component minimum , respectively .",
    "there is some difficulty with the measurement of the maximum polarization of @xmath28 in the intrinsic polarization spectrum , as there is variability at and around the position corresponding to the absorption line minimum in the flux spectrum .",
    "we note , however , that the redder lines show the expected inverted p - cygni profile in the polarization spectrum . at the second epoch , for @xmath72",

    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite present a number of reasons why this theoretical limit may not be actually observed : depolarization of resonantly scattered continuum photons in optically thick lines , the contribution of strong emission line components or clumpy ejecta .",
    "+ a significant clue as to the true reason behind the significant polarization is observed in the rotation of the polarization angle across the @xmath28 line ( and to a lesser extent for @xmath84 ) .",

    "+ _ scenario b : _ the jet - like flow ( kinetic energy dominated ) completely broke out of the progenitor prior to our first spectropolarimetric observation ( and those of @xcite , at 18 days prior to our first observation ) , such that no discontinuity would be apparent as in the case of the jet stalling within the core .",
    "such a scenario was suggested for sn  2002ap , where a polarization peak in the vicinity of @xmath4/ ir3 was interpreted as being due to light reflected by electrons in a high - velocity ni - rich jet - like clump , exterior to the main ejecta , moving at @xmath130 @xcite .",
