    "in the last three years , the large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) aboard the _ fermi _ satellite has proven a revolutionary detector of gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "these objects are rapidly rotating , highly magnetized neutron stars , whose rotation carries the gamma - ray emitting regions past an observer s line of sight , creating periodic pulsations .    with the lat ,",
    "pulsars have been detected via three different approaches .",
    "first , for pulsars known from radio observations , gamma - ray pulsations are detected by coherent folding of the lat photon arrival times based on the provided pulsar ephemerides ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "second , radio searches of unassociated gamma - ray sources , as listed in the _",
    "fermi_-lat second source catalog ( 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , have revealed new radio pulsars .",
    "the ephemerides obtained from radio timing observations are in turn used to coherently phase - fold the lat data and probe for gamma - ray pulsations ( e.g. ; * ? ? ?",

    "contrasting the previous two strategies , `` blind searches '' are not guided by prior knowledge of the pulsar parameters ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "within a year after launch of _ fermi _ , previous blind searches had impressively unveiled 24 pulsars @xcite using a time - differencing technique @xcite .",
    "another two pulsars were found after two years @xcite , however the detection rate had dropped since then , predominantly because of the increasing computational challenge with the longer data time span .",
    "the sensitivity of blind searches for gamma - ray pulsars is limited by computing cost , because a grid in the search parameter space ( for isolated systems typically sky location , frequency @xmath4 , and spin - down rate @xmath5 ) must be explicitly searched .",
    "the number of grid points required to discretely cover the relevant parameter space increases as a high power of the coherent integration time ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this problem is analogous to blind searches for continuous gravitational waves ( cws ) emitted from rapidly spinning neutron stars , where hierarchical strategies @xcite and semi - coherent methods are used to efficiently scan wide parameter - space ranges in years of data at finite computational resources .    here , we present the discovery and key parameters of a young , energetic gamma - ray pulsar , psr  j1838@xmath00537 , detected during a new blind survey exploiting a novel data - analysis method @xcite originally developed to blindly search for weak cw signals @xcite .",
    "the pulsar is spatially coincident with the extended source hess  j1841@xmath0055 @xcite , detected at very high energies ( vhe ; @xmath6tev ) .",
    "we show that the pulsar s energetics make this association plausible .",
    "in recent work @xcite we reported on the discovery of nine new gamma - ray pulsars in this novel , ongoing blind survey using 975 days of lat data . unlike those nine pulsars , psr  j1838@xmath00537 , being significantly younger , was initially detected only during the first year of data ( before its large glitch ) .",
    "after the glitch , recovering the ( weaker ) pulsations proved to be a substantial challenge requiring a dedicated follow - up study presented below ( section  [ s : fu - analysis ] ) .",
    "in the new blind - search effort , detecting psr  j1838@xmath00537 , we have utilized a hierarchical ( multistage ) approach .",
    "the first stage is semi - coherent , where coherent fourier powers computed over a 6-day window are incoherently combined by sliding the window over the entire 975 days of data .",
    "a fundamental new element of the search method is the exploitation of a parameter - space metric @xcite to build an efficient search grid ( in @xmath4 , @xmath5 _ and _ sky position ) . in a second stage ,",
    "significant semi - coherent candidates are automatically followed up via a fully coherent analysis .",
    "a third stage further refines coherent pulsar candidates by using higher signal harmonics adopting the @xmath7-test @xcite .",
    "further advances incorporated are described in @xcite .",
    "the survey targets unassociated sources from the 2fgl catalog with `` pulsar - like '' properties .",
    "such sources feature significantly curved emission spectra and low flux variability over time .",

    ", the initial pulsar parameters are further refined through a timing - analysis procedure . with techniques described in @xcite , pulse times of arrival ( toas )",
    "are precisely measured and parameters of a timing model are fit to these measurements .",
    "toas are obtained from subdividing the follow - up data set into 40  segments of about equal length .",

    "then tempo2  @xcite is used to fit the toas to a timing model including sky position , frequency and frequency derivatives .    as is typical for a youthful pulsar , psr  j1838@xmath00537 shows irregularities in its spin - frequency evolution that are of two types : ( i ) timing noise , observed as slowly varying , non - deterministic fluctuations in frequency , which can be modeled by including a second frequency derivative in fitting the toas ; ( ii ) glitch activity , an abrupt spin - frequency increase , typically followed by a recovery phase towards the pre - glitch rotational state .",
    "thus , the glitch of psr  j1838@xmath00537 leads to rapid loss of phase coherence in the timing analysis if not additionally accounted for .",
    "the spin - parameter changes after the glitch are estimated in a dedicated analysis . fixing the sky position at the pre - glitch ( before mjd  55100 ) timing solution ,",
    "ranges in frequency @xmath4 , frequency derivative @xmath5 , and second frequency derivative @xmath20 are scanned on a dense grid around their pre - glitch values , computing the weighted @xmath7-test @xcite at each grid point using photons within a fixed time window . as a balance between signal - to - noise ratio and time resolution , we use a window size of 90  days , which is just long enough to still produce a detectable signal - to - noise ratio",
    "this 90-day window is slid over the entire data set with 90% overlap between subsequent steps .",
    "the results ( figure  [ f : glitch ] ) indicate that the pulsar experienced a glitch near mjd  55100 .",
    "however , immediately after the nominal glitch epoch no convincing signal is detected for a period of about 300  days . this might be due to the pulsar s frequency changing faster during early glitch recovery than the @xmath44 phase model used . in this respect ,",

    "however , comparing the two different slopes from linear fits made during both time intervals , the slope during the post - glitch interval is smaller by about  27% .",
    "this effect is traced back to a reduction in exposure resulting from a change in _",
    "fermi_-lat s sky - survey observing pattern on 2009 september 3 ( mjd 55077 ) .",
    "this change has decreased the average exposure at the pulsar s sky position by about 24% ( figure  [ f : whtest ] , middle panel ) .",
    "hence , the exposure reduction explains ( within 3% ) the smaller rate in @xmath7-test increase over the later data ( the @xmath7-test is linear in the number of photons ) .",
    "this is further confirmed by observing no significant variation in weighted photon flux over time ( figure  [ f : whtest ] , lower panel ) .",
    "to determine whether psr  j1838@xmath00537 is also visible as a radio pulsar , a 1.7-hr observation has been conducted on 2011 may 27 with the green bank telescope ( gbt ) at 2  ghz .",
