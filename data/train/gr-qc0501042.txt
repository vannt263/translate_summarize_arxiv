    "a `` horizon '' generally means a surface across which no information can pass . in gravitational physics , there are two important horizons , the _ event horizon _ and the _ cauchy horizon_. when the gravitational field is very strong , some light rays that are emitted outwardly may run inwardly later .",
    "the event horizon is traced out by critical light rays which escape to infinity .",
    "the region surrounded by the event horizon is called a black hole .",
    "the stability of the black hole against the perturbations outside the event horizon has been well investigated  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the cauchy horizon is the future boundary of the cauchy development of a partial cauchy surface so that the predictability of physics breaks down beyond the cauchy horizon . see ref .",
    "@xcite for a rigorous definition of the event horizon and the cauchy horizon .",
    "it was subsequently proved that spacetime singularities inevitably appear under general situations and physical energy conditions  @xcite .",
    "gravitational collapse is one of the physical processes where singularities must appear . in this context , a _ cosmic censorship hypothesis _",
    "( cch ) was proposed by penrose , which asserts that singularities formed in generic gravitational collapse of physical matters can not be observed ; in other words , there are no _ naked singularities _ formed in physical gravitational collapse  @xcite .",
    "the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) solution and the reissner - nordstrm - de sitter ( rnds ) solution have a cauchy horizon as an inner horizon . inside it",
    "there is a central timelike singularity .",
    "however , penrose demonstrated that perturbations originating outside the black hole would be blue - shifted infinitely at the cauchy horizon , which results in a `` blue - sheet '' singularity  @xcite .",
    "it was found that this cauchy horizon is unstable against perturbations and transforms into a null weak curvature singularity  @xcite . in the presence of a positive cosmological constant , i.e. , the rnds solution , the cauchy horizon is also unstable  @xcite .",
    "the general proof of cch is , however , far from complete , and many counterexample candidates have been proposed in the framework of general relativity  @xcite .",
    "understanding the stability of naked - singular solutions gives clearly significant insight into the issue of cch , and further analyses which involve the full non - linear perturbations are required .    in this paper",
    "we study the stability of horizons against perturbations for a large class of static solutions .",
    "we consider the einstein - maxwell - scalar-@xmath1 system in the @xmath0-dimension , which contains the reissner - nordstrm-(anti ) de sitter ( rn(a)ds ) solution as a special solution . in recent years ,",
    "higher - dimensional asymptotically anti - de sitter spacetimes with spherical , plane , or hyperbolic symmetry play an important role as a bulk spacetime in the brane - world scenario  @xcite , so they are included in the analysis .",
    "the perturbation analysis is nonlinear and full order .",
    "this kind of perturbation is called a kink - mode perturbation .",
    "similar stability analyses have been done in spherically symmetric self - similar solutions in newtonian gravity  @xcite and general relativity  @xcite and in the context of the stationary accretion - disk flow to a compact object  @xcite .",
    "the organization of this paper is the following . in section",
    "ii , basic equations are presented . in section iii",
    ", the stability for the kink mode is analyzed in full order , and a stability criterion for this mode is derived . in section iv , applications to known static solutions , such as the rn(a)ds solution , are presented and the implications of the kink instability of the cauchy horizon are discussed .",

    "the maxwell equations ( [ maxwell ] ) can be easily integrated to give @xmath19 where we only consider the electric field produced by a constant charge @xmath20 . then the einstein equations and the equation of motion for the scalar field reduce to the following partial differential equations : @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 , \\label{basic4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath24 where a dot and a prime denote the partial derivatives with respect to @xmath16 and @xmath18 , respectively .",

    "@xcite . as a result ,",
    "( [ key ] ) becomes @xmath76 it should be noted that the perturbations are of full - order although this equation is linear .",
    "this is integrated to give @xmath77 where @xmath78    here we define instability by the exponential growth of discontinuity",
    ". then we find the following criterion : anti - transluminal horizons , i.e. , horizons with @xmath35 , are stable , while transluminal horizons , i.e. , horizons with @xmath79 , are unstable .",
    "degenerate horizons , i.e. , horizons with @xmath80 , are marginally stable .",
    "irrespective of the form of the potential @xmath81 , this stability criterion applies to any analytical and numerical solutions with regular horizons . in the above",
    ", we have discussed the stability of horizons that are future - directed outgoing null geodesics .",
    "if horizons are given by future - directed ingoing null geodesics , such as a cauchy horizon of rn(a)ds solution , we find serious coordinate degeneracy in the @xmath82 coordinates .",
    "hence , we need to reformulate the perturbation analysis using the @xmath83 coordinates : @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "@xmath87 is the retarded time coordinate . since the above form can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) through the coordinate transformation @xmath88 , the stability in terms of @xmath87 should be reversed from that in terms of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore , the stability of horizons which are given by future - directed ingoing null geodesics are the following : anti - transluminal horizons are unstable , while transluminal horizons are stable .",
    "degenerate horizons are marginally stable . in appendix",
    "[ gauge ] , we demonstrate in the four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime that these perturbations are gauge - invariant up to linear order .",
    "we have obtained the stability of horizons in @xmath0-dimensional static solutions in the einstein - maxwell - scalar-@xmath1 system without assuming the explicit form of the potential of the scalar field . the rn(a)ds solution is included in the analysis as a special case .",
    "the present work has shown for the first time the existence of the kink instability of horizons in static solutions in general relativity .",
    "the intriguing feature is that the kink instability grows exponentially in terms of @xmath16 . in contrast",
    "the kink mode perturbation blows up to infinity in a finite time in the self - similar perfect - fluid system with @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) in general relativity  @xcite .",
    "the stability of solutions against kink - mode perturbation is determined only by the local property , i.e. , the sign of @xmath91 at the horizon of the background static solutions .",
    "this criterion applies to a large class of horizons . for the rnds spacetime ,",
    "a black - hole event horizon is stable against the kink - mode perturbation .",
    "a cosmological event horizon is also stable . on the other hand ,",
    "a cauchy horizon is unstable . as a result ,",
    "a wide class of solutions suffers from the kink instability .",
    "there is a significant difference here from the case of self - similar solutions where the black - hole event horizon is stable but the cauchy horizon and the cosmological event horizon are not always unstable  @xcite .",
    "we consider the implications of the kink instability of horizons .",
    "the initial perturbations of the kink mode are inserted only in the future of the horizons , and therefore , this instability does @xmath92 prevent the horizons or the naked singularities from forming .",
    "the kink instability implies that , if the analyticity of a horizon is violated even weakly , the perturbed spacetime is much different from that with an analytic horizon .",
    "even so , this kind of instability does not cause the formation of a singularity on the horizon in finite time because the growth of the discontinuity is only exponential .",
    "an important example of kink - unstable horizons is the cauchy horizon of the rn(a)ds solution , which associates with a timelike naked singularity .",
    "it is generated by the first future - directed null ray emanated from the naked singularity .",
    "if the naked singularity forms in a gravitational collapse , the information from the singularity , which is physically unpredictable , affects only the future of the cauchy horizon , and the naked singularity may violate its analyticity .",
    "then , the inside region of the cauchy horizon is represented by a spacetime much different from that in the rn(a)ds solution .    as a thought experiment ,",
    "suppose that one drops an ideal small apparatus into the rn(a)ds black hole . in four - dimensional spherically symmetric case",
    ", the apparatus never arrives at the regular cauchy horizon because its back reaction to the spacetime actually disturbs the background before it reaches the cauchy horizon and the cauchy horizon is transformed into a null weak curvature singularity  @xcite .",
    "here we assume that the ideal apparatus has so small mass that its back reaction to the spacetime can be negligible but can disturb the scalar field at any time .",
    "then , it falls across the event horizon and reaches the cauchy horizon .",
    "at this moment , if it disturbs the scalar field , so that the second derivative of the scalar field is discontinuous , the disturbance grows up through kink instability and propagates along the cauchy horizon at the speed of light . as a result ,",
    "the gravitational field inside of the cauchy horizon is very much modified .",
    "hm would like to thank shoji kato and ken - ichi nakao for useful comments .",
    "this work was partially supported by a grant for the 21st century coe program ( holistic research and education center for physics self - organization systems ) at waseda university .",
    "th was supported from the jsps .",
    "we demonstrate in the four - dimensional spherically symmetric spacetime that the perturbations are gauge - invariant up to linear order .",
    "all notations here follow  @xcite .",
    "we write the spherically symmetric spacetime as a product manifold @xmath93 with metric @xmath94 where @xmath95 is an arbitrary lorentz metric on @xmath96 , @xmath18 is a scalar on @xmath96 with @xmath97 defining the boundary of @xmath96 , and @xmath98 is the unit curvature metric on @xmath99 .",
    "we introduce the covariant derivatives on spacetime @xmath100 , the subspacetime @xmath96 and the unit sphere @xmath99 with @xmath101 we denote a perturbed scalar field @xmath41 as @xmath102 hereafter we linearize the perturbation .",
    "spherically symmetric metric perturbations are written as @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath107 are a tensor and a scalar on @xmath96 and @xmath108 is a constant .",

    "since @xmath112 we have @xmath113 from eq .",
