    "used to produce two dimensional square lattices , one of the orbitals has a larger energy than the other two .",
    "this reduces the model to only two species ( the @xmath7 and @xmath8 states ) in the low energy limit . on cubic or square lattices , the hopping parameters from a site to its neighbors are anisotropic and take two very different values depending on the hopping direction , parallel or perpendicular to the orbital axis .",
    "isacsson and girvin @xcite studied the limit where the hopping in the transverse directions is totally suppressed .",
    "this led them to suggest that in two dimensions their model may develop a peculiar columnar phase ordering where the phases of particles in the @xmath9 states are coherent along the @xmath10 direction and uncorrelated in the transverse direction .",
    "bosons in high orbital bands are not in the true ground state .",
    "this feature gives rise to the possibility of new states of matter beyond the `` no - node '' theorem @xcite that is obeyed by the conventional becs of single component bosons .",
    "this theorem states that the many - body ground state wavefunctions of bosons under very general conditions are positive - definite .",
    "it implies that time - reversal symmetry can not be spontaneously broken .",

    "recently , unconventional symmetries have been introduced to the single - boson condensates in high orbital bands in optical lattices @xcite , denoted as `` unconventional becs '' ( ubecs ) .",
    "their condensate wave functions belong to nontrivial representations of the lattice point group .",
    "in other words , they are non-@xmath11-wave in analogy to unconventional pairing symmetries of superconductivity .",
    "liu and wu @xcite studied analytically the ubecs in the @xmath0-orbital band with non zero transverse hopping exhibiting a @xmath12 type symmetry , and thus breaking time - reversal symmetry spontanously with a complex - valued condensate wavefunction .",
    "they predicted for densities , @xmath13 , larger than two particles per site , the existence of a superfluid phase where the system condenses at non zero quasi - momentum and which is accompanied by a staggered order of the orbital angular momentum ( sam ) .",
    "recently , the model was studied using an effective action approach @xcite and a similar sf phase with sam order was predicted even for @xmath14 as well as an antiferromagnetic mott phase .",
    "its physics was also examined in one dimension @xcite . for unconventional symmetries such as the @xmath15-wave of high t@xmath16 cuprates ,",
    "phase - sensitive detections provide definitive evidence @xcite . for the non-@xmath11-wave ubecs , phase - sensitive detection on condensate symmetries",
    "has also been proposed through raman transition @xcite .",
    "such an exotic sf phase was observed in a recent experiment by wirth , lschlger , and hemmerich @xcite in a two dimensional checkerboard lattice composed of @xmath11 and @xmath0-orbitals sites and had been investigated theoretically by cai et al . @xcite .",
    "the nearest neighbors of @xmath11-sites being @xmath0-sites , an atom can not go directly from a @xmath0-site to another as was the case in liu and wu s model @xcite .",

    "becs with unconventional condensate symmetries have also been observed in the solid state exciton - polariton lattice systems @xcite .    in this work",
    ", we will study the model originally proposed by liu and wu @xcite with quantum monte carlo simulations . to reproduce qualitatively the different phases observed in hemmerich s group experiment",
    ", we will add to the original model an anisotropy term in the form of an energy difference between @xmath7 and @xmath8 orbitals .",
    "finally , in addition to studying the superfluid phase , we will also focus on the insulating phases that arise in such systems for strong enough interactions and integer densities .",
    "in section ii of this article , we will introduce and discuss the model , in section iii we will show that it can be mapped on a bosonic spin-1/2 model and establish the correspondence between the phases observed . in section iv , we will present the results of our simulations and conclude in section v.",

    "this is essentially the physics of second hund s rule applied to the bosonic orbital system : complex orbitals are spatially more extended to save repulsive interactions .",
    "the last term in the hamiltonian , eq .",

    "this is the staggered angular momentum order mentioned in the introduction , and it is clear that it is compatible with a phase ordering that corresponds to the condensation at non zero momentum for both @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles .",
    "finally the @xmath42 term in eq .",
    "( [ interaction ] ) should suppress this kind of order since it requires having the same number of @xmath7 and @xmath8 particles by increasing the density of @xmath8 particles . if the system remains superfluid when it is composed mostly of @xmath8 particles , the phase will alternate between sites along the @xmath18 direction and will be coherent in the @xmath17 direction , thus forming stripes along the @xmath17 axis .",

    "then , following a schwinger boson approach @xcite , the corresponding spin 1/2 operators are defined : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 . with these definitions ,",
    "the model is rewritten , up to some constants , as @xmath65 where @xmath66 and plays a rle similar to the @xmath67 operator in the original model .",
    "up to the external field term along the @xmath58-direction , this is the model that was studied in @xcite with @xmath68 and @xmath69 for the values of the parameters used in these articles . for @xmath70",
    ", it was shown that the system is always ferromagnetic at low temperature . on a given site",
    ", the absolute value of the projection of the spin along the @xmath17 axis is maximized due to the negative @xmath71 term .",

    "for such moderate @xmath75 , the interaction is not large enough to block particles in a mott phase but , to lower the energy , the system adopts states that have non zero @xmath33 on a site and the hopping terms lock the relative phases into an sam order . as in the mott case , the sam order will disappear if the system is composed of only @xmath8 particles due to a large value of @xmath42 ( see fig .",

    "there are four different phases : a mott phase , a mott phase with staggered orbital momentum ( sam ) order , a superfluid phase with sam order and a striped superfluid .",

    "this can be understood by recalling that the @xmath122 term scales as the square of the density .",
