    "quantumness and classicality of a system have been discussed previously by many authors .",
    "the classical and quantum pictures of physical phenomena are known to be quite different .",
    "for example , the quantum behavior of a particle must satisfy some constraints due to hierarchy of uncertainty relations which corresponds to describing quantum states by nonnegative density operators . on the other hand ,",
    "the probability - distribution function of a classical particle in phase space must be nonnegative while wigner function @xcite , quantum analogue of the classical probability distribution , is permitted to get negative values .",
    "if one uses the formal analogue of density operators for a classical particle , the domain of such operators is permitted to contain hermitian trace - class nonpositive operators . from this viewpoint",
    "it is much easier to think about differences between quantum and classical pictures than to consider their similarities .",
    "nevertheless , it is of vital importance to find explicit criteria for distinguishing classical and quantum properties , e.g. , to relate quantumness of two - qubit states with the existence of quantum correlations expressed in terms of bell ( bell - like ) inequality violation @xcite .",
    "besides , quantumness of a bipartite system can be considered by means of entropy relations ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . here",
    ", we are not going to discuss these tests and the attention is chiefly focused on the simple quantumness test for a single system that has been proposed recently in @xcite , critically analyzed in @xcite , and experimentally realized for a two - level single system in @xcite .",
    "the main idea of this test is to find observables @xmath2 and @xmath3 such that the mean values @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 are greater than or equal to zero for all possible states of a system .",
    "the classicality corresponds to commutative algebra and if this is the case , the inequality @xmath7 holds true for all possible system states .",
    "otherwise , if @xmath8 for a particular state , then these measurement results can not be attributed to the standard classical model and are to be treated as quantum ones .",
    "the observable @xmath9 was called quantumness witness @xcite because its negative average value for a given state is an intermediate evidence that system behaves in quantum manner .",
    "it is worth noting that the problem of distinguishing quantumness and classicality is of vital importance for the practical realization of quantum computer which is supposed to be essentially quantum to work adequately .",
    "though there is no conventional definition of quantumness , we will use this concept in that sense that the classical probabilistic model is incapable of accounting for measurement outcomes .",
    "recently an appropriate method for considering similarity and difference of classical and quantum features was suggested @xcite , where the quantum states were associated with the standard probability distributions like in classical statistical mechanics .",
    "the approach called tomographic - probability representation of quantum states was developed , e.g. , in @xcite and reviewed recently in @xcite .",
    "this approach turned out to be convenient @xcite to study quantumness test @xcite given for qubits .",
    "the aim of this paper is to interpret the test inequality @xcite from the tomographic point of view and propose quantumness witness for a general qudit state , i.e. , for particle with an arbitrary spin @xmath0 . in regarding test procedure",
    "we also indicate the difference between probabilistic approaches to description of @xmath1-level system , namely , tomographic - probability representation and classical statistical model .",
    "another goal of this paper is to apply the quantumness test to systems with continuous variables , for instance , two - mode light states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in sec .",
    "[ section : spin - tomogram ] , we epitomize spin tomograms and dual tomographic symbols . in sec .",
    "[ section : test ] , the test inequality is developed by virtue of tomograms and explanation is given why , using probabilities , the inequality can be violated in quantum domain and is always valid in classical domain . in sec .",
    "[ section : witness ] , an explicit formula of quantumness witnetness is suggested for a general spin-@xmath0 case . in sec .",
    "[ section : two - mode - light ] , quantumness of two - mode light states is investigated by utilizing jordan - schwinger map to qudit states .",
    "finally , in sec . [ section : conclusions ] , conclusions are presented .",
    "in quantum mechanics , any state of a particle with spin @xmath0 can be equivalently described either by @xmath10 density matrix @xmath11 or by the following probability - distribution function called spin tomogram @xcite :    @xmath12    where @xmath13 is an eigenstate of the angular momentum operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 is a @xmath10 unitary matrix of the irreducible representation either of group @xmath17 or @xmath18 with @xmath19 , and by @xmath20 we denote the so - called dequantizer operator ( as concerns star - product quantization schemes , the general procedure of using this operator is discussed in @xcite ) .",
    "any tomogram satisfies normalization conditions of the form    @xmath21    the latter equation implies that @xmath16 is a group element of @xmath17 and is parameterized by euler angles @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 .    given the spin tomogram one can reconstruct the density operator @xmath25 by means of the special operator @xmath26 called quantizer ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "namely ,    @xmath27    dual tomographic symbol @xmath28 of the operator @xmath29 is introduced by replacing @xmath25 by @xmath29 and substituting @xmath30 for @xmath20 and vice versa @xcite and was anticipated in the paper @xcite . to be precise ,",
    "@xmath31    @xmath32    dual tomographic symbols are particularly useful for calculations of mean values of observables .",
    "indeed , average values can be expressed with the help of tomographic symbols only    @xmath33",
    "let us consider two possible probability descriptions of an @xmath34-level system .",
    "the state of a system is given by the point on the @xmath35-simplex , i.e. , by the probability vector @xmath36 with @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "observable @xmath2 is considered as a function with possible outcomes @xmath39 which correspond to appropriate system states .",
    "then the average value of @xmath2 reads    @xmath40    nonnegativity of @xmath2 for all possible states implies that @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "similarly , the condition @xmath43 is followed by the inequality @xmath44 for all @xmath42 . if this is the case , the mean value of @xmath9 is necessarily nonnegative .",
    "in fact ,    @xmath45    or in the matrix form        it was shown in sec .",
    "[ section : spin - tomogram ] , that any state of particle with spin @xmath0 is uniquely determined by its spin tomogram . in a similar way , any operator @xmath29 acting on hilbert space of states @xmath13 is equivalently described by its ordinary or dual tomographic symbols .",
    "suppose @xmath47 are possible outcomes while measuring @xmath29 , i.e. , eigenvalues of @xmath29 .",
    "then the average value @xmath48 can be expressed in terms of tomogram @xmath49 and spectrum @xmath50 . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "the case of qubits ( @xmath51 ) was considered in detail , where the authors used formula ( [ eq : trace - by - tomograms ] ) as well as the explicit form of quantizer and dequantizer operators . here",
    "we extend the formula obtained to a general qudit case .",
    "suppose @xmath52 is a unitary matrix of group @xmath18 such that it reduces the self - adjacent operator @xmath29 to the diagonal form , i.e. ,    @xmath53    then the average value of @xmath29 reads    @xmath54 ~&&\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    can be negative even if the inequality @xmath55 holds true for all possible states .",
    "comparing formulas ( [ eq : inequality - class ] ) and ( [ eq : inequality - quant ] ) one can see that both classical and quantum behavior of a system are described by probabilities .",
    "the difference is merely that the classical state is associated with the set of constants @xmath36 while the quantum state corresponds to the function @xmath49 depending on an element @xmath16 of group @xmath18 .",
    "the abundance of quantumness witnesses for an arbitrary qudit state @xmath56 was emphasized in @xcite . in spite of this fact ,",
    "the construction of the quantumness witness for a given state @xmath25 was not presented in the explicit manner and relied much on an implicit form of the quantumness witness for qubits . here",
    "we suggest explicit operators @xmath29 and @xmath57 that can fill this gap .",
    "* proposition*. given the diagonal @xmath58 density matrix @xmath59 , quantum behavior of this state can be checked by virtue of the quantumness witness @xmath60 with    @xmath61    where @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 is the kronecker symbol .",
    "* proof*. it is evident that the operators @xmath65 and @xmath66 are nonnegative by construction .",
    "besides , the operator @xmath67 has only nonnegative eigenvalues so the requirement @xmath68 is met for all possible states .",
    "let us now show that @xmath69 .    indeed , using explicit formulas of operators from the statement of proposition",
    ", we obtain     quantum behavior of qutrit state @xmath70 is pointed out by the negativity of the average value of the quantumness witness @xmath71 given by ( [ eq : a&b - witness ] ) .",
    "the smaller the radius of the circle on the surface the closer one approaches to the maximally mixed state @xmath72 .",
    "witness is not defined for this state because it is classical . ]",

    "a proper choice of @xmath81 , namely @xmath63 , ensures    @xmath82    which is the best evidence of quantumness witness and concludes the proof @xmath83 .    to exemplify this proposition we consider the case of qutrits ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and plot the corresponding average value of quantumness witness versus parameters @xmath86 and @xmath87 of the diagonal density matrix @xmath76 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) .",
    "the pattern in fig . [ figure2 ] confirms that the proved proposition is applicable not only to qutrits but also to an arbitrary spin system .",
    "proposition is followed by a simple    * consequence*. let @xmath16 be a unitary matrix of group @xmath18 that reduces the given density matrix @xmath11 to the diagonal form , i.e. , @xmath88 . then the operator @xmath89 with @xmath90 and @xmath91 is a quantumness witness for the state @xmath11 .     maximum mean value of quantumness witness against number of levels @xmath19 ( dots ) .",
    "solid line is an asymptote of this dependence and is predicted by ( [ eq : asymptote ] ) .",
    "negativity of all the values allows to detect quantumness of any qudit state with an arbirary spin @xmath0 . ]",
    "applying the jordan - schwinger map @xcite to qudits , one can readily extend quantumness tests to two - mode light states . by construction ,",
    "the following correspondence is ascertained :    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     here , @xmath92 and @xmath93 ( @xmath94 and @xmath95 ) are annihilation and creation operators in each mode , @xmath96 and @xmath97 are numbers of photons in the first and the second modes , respectively .",
    "this analogy implies that in order to check the quantumness of the state @xmath98 one should follow the procedure :    \\(i ) map this state onto qudit state @xmath99 with @xmath100 and @xmath101 ;    \\(ii ) construct quantumness witness @xmath89 for state @xmath99 in accordance with the proposition in the previous section ;    \\(iii ) using the table above , fulfil inverse mapping of the constructed witness onto operator acting on hilbert space of two - mode light states ;    \\(iv ) make sure that the average value of the final witness is negative for the given state @xmath98 .",
    "the remarkable fact is that the proposed approach is incapable to indicate the quantumness of the vacuum state . in this sense",
    "the method developed is analogues to quasiprobabilistic treatment of wigner function @xcite .",
    "to summarize we underline main results of the paper .",
    "the article is concerned with @xmath34-level systems ( qudits with spin @xmath0 , @xmath19 ) and then is extended to deal with two - mode light states .",
    "we managed to consider quantumness tests proposed recently from the probabilistic point of view . according to this approach",
    ", we regarded both classical and quantum states by virtue of probabilities , the former being described by constant numbers and the latter being associated with the probability - distribution function depending on a group element .",
    "this difference between two descriptions explains the reason why the test inequality is always fulfilled in classical domain and can be violated in quantum one .",
    "the explicit form of quantumness witness is suggested for a general qudit case .",
    "apart from the analytical proof , some examples are also given to check an adequate work and illustrate the usefulness of this witness .",
    "jordan - schwinger map of spin states onto two - mode light states is utilized as a key step toward quantumness tests for systems with continuous variables .",
    "we hope to extend quantumness witness formulated in the work for second momenta to the inequalities containing higher moments .",
