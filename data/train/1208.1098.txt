    "the simple epidemic process with recovery or the _ gribov process _ @xcite serves as an example of a prototypical nonequilibrium phase transition . it ,",

    "see refs .",
    "a simple realization of the dp process is the predator - prey cellular automaton models .",
    "these models display nonequilibrium active to absorbing state phase transitions ( aapt ) separating active from inactive or absorbing states due to competitions between spontaneous particle decay ( death ) and particle production ( birth ) processes . in these models for certain parameter values , the steady state density is zero , i.e. , the species gets extinct . by definition , once reached an absorbing configuration , the system can not escape from these configurations  @xcite .",
    "experimental realizations of dp universality has been reported in ref .",
    "@xcite recently , where transitions between two topologically different turbulent states of nematic liquid crystals in their electrohydrodynamic convection regimes were observed . ref .",
    "@xcite measured the relevant scaling exponents with high accuracy and found them to belong to the dp universality class .",
    "the critical behavior of the aapt @xcite depends on the conservation laws in the dynamics and the underlying symmetry .",
    "it has been conjectured in the form of the _ directed percolation hypothesis _",
    "@xcite that in the absence of any special symmetry or conservation laws the aapt belongs to the dp universality class as long as the system has a single absorbing state . in a more realistic situation ,",
    "the spreading process in dp can also be long ranged .",
    "for example , consider infecting agents being advected by a local velocity field ( e.g. , parasites being carried in a wind flow in an ecological system ) .",
    "to analyze such a situation , ref .",
    "@xcite introduced a variation of the epidemic process with an infection probability distribution that decays with the distance @xmath0 as a power law .",
    "such long range dp models have analyzed in details numerically @xcite , as well as analytically by using field theoretic methods @xcite .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated four possible set of universal exponents for the long range dp problem , corresponding to four different pairs of ( renormalization group ) fixed point values for the two coupling constants in the model , reflecting several possible universal scaling behavior .",
    "@xcite enumerates the critical exponents at each of the fixed points and their stabilities .",
    "more recently , ref .",
    "@xcite discusses the effects of temporally @xmath1-correlated multiplicative noises on the universal properties of the aapt .",
    "they discussed the condition under which the usual dp universality class becomes unstable with respect to perturbations by the multiplicative noises .    in the usual models belonging to the dp universality ,",
    "the parameters defining the models are taken to be constants .",
    "thus they represent a constant ( non - fluctuating ) environment . in this article",
    "we discuss the general question of how interactions with a spatially and temporally fluctuating environment affects the statistical properties of a percolating agent or the density of a near - extinct population @xmath2 at the critical point of an aapt belonging to the dp universality class , by coupling the environmental fluctuations explicitly with the growth process . in order to address this question ,",
    "we consider two different cases of fluctuating environments separately , namely , ( i ) a randomly stirred fluid , described by the navier - stokes ( ns ) equation , and ( ii ) a fluctuating surface , modeled by the kardar - parisi - zhang ( kpz ) or edward - wilkinson ( ew ) equations .",
    "we do not consider any feedback of @xmath2 to the environment , i.e. , the time evolution of the environment is autonomous .",
    "in all the cases , the coupling with the environment is nonlinear .",
    "further we drive the environment ( i.e. , the ns , kpz or ew equations ) by gaussian stochastic long - ranged forces with specified variances . because of our choice for the dynamics of the environment",
    ", it itself displays universal spatial and dynamical scaling in the long wavelength limit , with the universality class depending upon the model used . in each of the cases we calculate the relevant scaling exponents at the critical point .",
    "the main result that we find is that the scaling behavior of the system near the extinction point of the aapt depends generally upon the location of the system in the phase space spanned by dimensionality @xmath3 and a parameter @xmath4 that characterizes the spatial scaling of the noise correlations in the ns , kpz or ew models , and depending upon the location in the phase space , the model may exhibit _ strong dynamical scaling _",
    ", when the dynamics of the field @xmath2 and the environment are characterized by the same dynamic exponent , or",
    "_ weak dynamical scaling _",
    ", when the two have different dynamic exponents . specifically in our model",
    ", weak dynamic scaling implies scaling properties of @xmath2 belonging to the dp universality class , where as strong dynamic scaling corresponds to non - dp behavior .",
    "it may be noted that aapt in contact with a randomly stirred velocity field has been considered in ref .",
    "we compare our results and scheme of calculations with ref .",
    "@xcite later .",
    "motivations of our work are _ both theoretical and phenomenological_. our results are similar to those in ref .",
    "@xcite , and provides for a mechanism to introduce long range flight in the otherwise local models of epidemic with recovery .",
    "presence of both weak and strong dynamic scaling ( in different regions of the phase space ) makes it a good candidate to study general issues related to dynamical scaling in ness .",
    "apart from theoretical motivations , the models and results discussed here are useful in more biologically motivated context .",
    "let us consider the specific example of a bacteria colony ( or a biofilm of bacteria ) undergoing simple cell division and death in its ordered ( nematic or polar ) phase .",
    "the nematic or polar order parameter being a broken symmetry mode obeys a dynamics that is scale invariant .",
    "this should be coupled to the dynamics of the bacteria density , which in addition to the growth decay terms , should have symmetry - allowed couplings with the order parameter field .",
    "moreover , bacteria being living systems , there should be specific nonequilibrium stresses ( or _ active stresses _ ) arising from the continuous energy consumption of the living bacteria .",
    "thus one obtains a coupled model of a density undergoing the extinction transition and a broken - symmetry order parameter field executing scale invariant dynamics .",
    "our results here will help us understanding the interplay between the density field and the order parameter field in determining the universal scaling near the extinction threshold for more realistic naturally occurring systems .",

    "in order to set up the calculational background of our model , let us briefly revisit the problem of extinction of a single species in a uniform environment and its universal properties near the extinction threshold . as an example , let us consider population dynamics with population growth rate that depends linearly on the local density of the species and death rate that depends quadratically on the local density also undergoing a non - equilibrium active to absorbing state ( i.e. , species extinction ) phase transition whose long distance large time properties are well - described by the dp universality class . in terms of a local particle number density @xmath5 and taking diffusive modes into account , the langevin equation that describes such a population dynamics is given by [ see , e.g. , ref .",

    "( [ dpeq ] ) ensures the in - principle existence of an absorbing state ( @xmath12 ) in the system .",
    "equation ( [ dpeq ] ) allows us to extract the characteristic length @xmath13 and diffusive time scale @xmath14 on dimensional ground , both of which diverge upon approaching the critical point at @xmath15 . upon defining the critical exponents in the usual way @xcite @xmath16 we identify the mean - field values @xmath17 further",
    ", the anomalous dimension @xmath18 , which characterizes the spatial scaling of the two - point correlation function , is zero @xcite .",
    "it is , however , well - known that fluctuations are important near the critical point and as a result mean - field values for the exponents are quantitatively inaccurate . in order to account for the fluctuation effects , dynamic renormalization group ( drg ) calculations have been performed over an equivalent path integral description of the langevin eq .",

    "only when one or more conditions of the dp hypothesis are violated , one finds new universal properties .",
    "for instance , the presence of long range interactions are known to modify the scaling behavior : ref .",
    "@xcite examines the competition between short and long ranged interactions , and identified four different possible phases .",
    "our results assume importance in this backdrop : in our model , long - ranged interactions arise not because of any long range hopping , but due to coupling of the density @xmath2 with an _ environment _ , modeled by a randomly stirred fluid or a growing and fluctuating surfaces , all of which in turn are driven by long range noises .",
    "it is expected that the presence of these long - range correlated background may affect the universal scaling behavior ; our results below confirm this in general .      here",
    "we consider a randomly stirred fluid as a fluctuating environment coupled to the aapt of a population density near its extinction threshold .",

    "we are interested when @xmath34 .",
    "since in this case the variance ( [ yakhotnoise ] ) diverges in the hydrodynamic limit , the force @xmath29 is said to be long - ranged and is infra red ( ir ) singular .",

    "@xcite to calculate scaling behavior and various universal quantities associated with homogeneous and isotropic @xmath36 fluid turbulence .",
    "the velocity field shows universal spatial and dynamical scaling independent of the microscopic viscosity and forcing amplitude@xcite .",
    "these scaling properties are characterized by the roughness exponent @xmath37 and dynamic exponent @xmath38 defined through the definition v_i ( * x*,t)v_i(0,0)~| x|^2_vf_v(|x|^z_e / t),[scalev ] where @xmath39 is a scaling function .",
    "invariance under the galilean transformation ( see below ) yields that the coupling constant does not receive any fluctuation correction in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "a consequence of that is the exact relation between the exponents @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xcite : @xmath40 . applications of one - loop drg to systems with long range noises are more complicated and less controlled than its application in problems of equilibrium critical dynamics @xcite . despite the limitations , such calculations are successful in obtaining several useful results on dimensionless numbers and scaling exponents .",
    "due to the infra red singular nature of the bare noise variance ( [ yakhotnoise ] ) , the perturbation theory does not generate any fluctuation correction to the bare noise variance ( [ yakhotnoise ] ) which is more singular than it .",
    "consequently , it is assumed to be unrenormalized .",
    "thus in a renormalized perturbation theory , only kinematic viscosity @xmath41 undergoes nontrivial renormalization .",
    "an explicit one - loop drg calculation yields z_e=2-y/3.[ze ] further , @xmath42 .",
    "thus for sufficiently high value of @xmath4 , @xmath38 may even be less than unity , resulting into _ turbulent diffusion _ which is a very efficient way of mixing .",
    "in particular , the value @xmath43 in ( [ yakhotnoise ] ) is of particular physical interest , since it corresponds to the famous k41 energy spectrum for the velocity field : one finds for the one - dimensional energy spectrum @xmath44 in three dimensions .      in the standard models for epidemic with recovery belonging to the dp universality class , the population density field @xmath2",
    "is allowed only to diffuse ( apart from local reproduction and death ) .",
    "however in general , such processes ( of reproduction and death ) may take place in a fluid environment and the local population may get advected in addition to diffusing .",
    "thus they may be called _ reaction - advection - diffusion _ systems .",
    "for instance , a reaction or birth / death of bacteria may take place in fluid , which in turn may be thermally fluctuating , or may be externally stirred . here , we find out how the universal properties of standard aapt are affected when the system is advected by an externally stirred fluid .    the percolating field @xmath2 satisfies the same equation ( [ dpeq ] ) , now supplemented by an advective non - linearity : @xmath45 here , @xmath46 is a coupling constant , which advectively couples @xmath2 with @xmath23 . constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 denote growth and decay rates .",

    "note that the last two non - linear terms in ( [ action1 ] ) _ do not _ have the same coupling constant @xmath61 , unlike the usual dp problem .",
    "this is consistent with the lack of invariance of @xmath57 under the _ rapidity symmetry_. the rapidity symmetry of the original dp problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) is no longer admissible in the present case , since the navier - stokes eq .",
    "( [ ns ] ) being a viscous dissipative equation can not be invariant under time inversion .",
    "before we present our detailed drg calculation , let us note the following : since the dynamics of the randomly stirred fluid is independent of @xmath2 , its dynamic exponent @xmath38 should be same as that in the absence of any percolating agent .",
    "we have @xmath62 ( see discussions above and the calculations below ) . thus if there is a regime characterized by _ strong dynamic scaling _ , we should have @xmath63 . in this regime , the nonlinearity of the basic dp process ( i.e. , coupling constants @xmath64 and @xmath65 ) may or may not be relevant in an rg sense , corresponding to what we call ldp ( long - range dp ) and lr ( long range ) phases having different static scaling properties ( the dynamic exponents are same in ldp and lr phases ) , characterized by the ldp and lr fixed points ( fp ) , respectively .",
    "in contrast , when the coupling constant @xmath46 that couples @xmath2 and @xmath23 is irrelevant in drg sense , the dynamics of @xmath2 is independent of @xmath23 and hence @xmath2 displays a dynamics that is identical to the usual dp problem with a dynamic exponent @xmath66 .",
    "can there be a phase displaying weak dynamic scaling with @xmath46 still being relevant ?",
    "we expect not ; because if @xmath46 is indeed relevant ( in an rg sense ) , the the whole action ( [ action1 ] ) including the coupling term @xmath67 must be invariant under combined rescaling of space , time and fields characterized by a single set of exponents , i.e. , a single dynamic exponent .",
    "thus the assumption of weak dynamic scaling , i.e. , the existence of two unequal dynamic exponents , rules out the drg relevance of @xmath46 .",
    "finally one may in principle have a phase where _ all _ nonlinerities are irrelevant with the @xmath2-field being characterized by the exponents of the linear theory ( gaussian phase ) which turns out to be always linearly unstable .",
    "thus , in short , we expect four different phases characterized by four fps ( lr , ldp , dp and gaussian ) and their associated set of exponents",
    ". some of these phases may not be linearly stable .",
    "we shall confirm these physically inspired picture through detailed one - loop calculations below .",

    "the role of the ( bare or _ unrenormalized _ ) coupling constants in the ordinary perturbation theory in the present model is played by @xmath69 and @xmath70 . in addition , there is a dimensionless number @xmath71 , the _ schmidt number _ which characterizes the ensuing ness of the aapt , and is a control parameter of the model .",

    "the galilean invariance of the present model leads to exact ward identities between certain two- and three - point vertex functions , which yields that the coupling constant @xmath80 does not renormalize @xcite .",

    "the general picture that emerges out of our calculations is that depending upon relative values of @xmath72 and @xmath4 , a parameter that fixes the spatial scaling of variances of the external forces in the ns , ew or kpz equations , one obtains different universal behavior .",
    "however , the details of the ensuing phase diagram in the @xmath301 plane depend explicitly on the model used to describe the environment ( ns , ew or kpz ) . on general ground",
    "we predict possibilities of four different phases",
    "( i ) gaussian , ( ii ) original dp , ( iii ) long - range dp ( ldp ) and ( iv ) long - range ( lr ) .",
    "the gaussian fixed point is generally unstable .",
    "the rest are model dependent ( i.e. , depends upon whether the environment is modeled by the ns , ew or kpz eq . ) . for a randomly stirred environment described by the ns eq .",
    ", we find when @xmath302 , the ensuing universal critical behavior of the aapt transition is described by the standard dp universality class characterized the dp fixed point with the renormalized coupling constants @xmath231 , @xmath154 , corresponding to a dynamic exponent @xmath303 , the dynamic exponent of the environment .",
    "thus one obtains weak dynamic scaling , despite the nonlinear coupling between @xmath2 and the environment ( here : velocity @xmath23 ) . in the other regime ,",
    "i.e. , when @xmath304 , the dp fixed point gets unstable against perturbations due to the environmental fluctuations , and the aapt is described by a set of critical exponents that depend upon @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding phases are described by either the ldp fixed point @xmath305 and @xmath306 , or by the lr fixed point @xmath121 and @xmath307 . in both these regimes @xmath63 , thus describing strong dynamic scaling .",
    "we obtain the relevant scaling exponents in all the phases .",
    "agreement of our results for the scaling exponents and the phase diagram with those in ref .",
    "@xcite shows the general robustness of the perturbation theory , despite our using ( slightly ) different choices for the coupling constants .",
    "it also shows how such choices may be exploited to infer the large length - scale , long - time limit physics of the system in a simple manner .",
    "in contrast , when the environment is a fluctuating surface modeled by the ew eq . , the dp phase is linearly stable for @xmath308 .",
    "we further find that the lr phase is not at all stable for any @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the ldp phase does not exist in the range @xmath253 .",
    "thus , the phase diagram in this case does not have any physically meaningful phase in the range @xmath309 , unlike the ns case where the phase diagram is fully spanned by the stable phases of the system .",
    "the ldp phase here corresponds to strong dynamic scaling and the dp phase weak dynamic scaling .",
    "we obtain the associated scaling exponents as well .",
    "for an environment described by a fluctuating kpz surface , we again find the existence of four different phases similar to the previous cases .",
    "we are able to obtain the scaling exponents in each phase and show that strong dynamic scaling prevails in the ldp and lr phases , as expected .",
    "however , due to the algebraically complicated nature of the drg @xmath109-functions we do not discuss their linear stability here .",
    "validity of our results are limited by the applicability of one - loop approximations which suffer from well - known technical difficulties @xcite in systems with long range noises .",
    "thus it is important to verify our results in numerical simulations of the models used here .",
    "further , it is unclear how multiscaling of the velocity field given by the randomly stirred ns model or the height field given by the kpz equation affect the scaling of the percolating agent @xmath2 , or whether @xmath2 itself will display multiscaling for its higher order structure functions . since the ew equation is a linear equation , it does not show any multiscaling .",
    "however still , field @xmath2 may display multiscaling , similar to the passive scalar problem of fluid turbulence , where even if the velocity field is gaussian distributed ( albeit with a long ranged spatial correlation ) , the passive scalar density exhibits multiscaling @xcite .",
    "we look forward to numerical solutions of the continuum model equations in resolving the outstanding theoretical issues discussed above . in addition",
    ", the effects of ew or kpz fluctuating surfaces on the dp universality may be studied by numerical simulations of lattice - gas type models , which may be constructed by borrowing , e.g. , the lattice - gas models used in ref .  @xcite to study the dynamics of a passive scalar on fluctuating surfaces .",
    "effects of turbulent flow on the dp universality may in principle be investigated by adopting the experimental set up of ref .",
    "@xcite and stirring the system with long - ranged external forces , or by observing grwoth / decay of a bacteria colony in a turbulent flow .",
    "our models and results provide for simple examples of _ weak dynamic scaling _ , situations which are not very commonly found .",
    "known examples include the studies in refs .",
    "our semi - autonomous models , where effects of the local population on the environment is completely neglected , are certainly a simplification of more realistic situations where such feedback effects should be present in general .",
    "a non - zero feedback is known to affect the scaling properties of the ness in general .",
    "for instance , the scaling / multiscaling properties of the magnetic fields in three - dimensional magnetohydrodynamics ( @xmath36mhd ) are vastly different when the feedback ( in the form of lorentz forces in @xmath36mhd ) is present from when it is absent ( the passive vector limit ) @xcite . given this , it would be interesting see how feedback due to @xmath2 may alter the emerging scaling behavior discussed here . when a feedback is present , the overall system is no longer autonomous , but fully coupled",
    ". it would be intriguing to see if weak dynamic scaling persists even in the fully coupled case .",
    "a truly novel feature of our results is that , in all the three models considered here regardless of stability issues , the lr and the ldp fps correspond to the _ same _ value of the dynamic exponent @xmath130 , but _ different _",
    "values for the static scaling exponents @xmath310 .",
    "this is in contrast with what one finds in equilibrium critical dynamics .",
    "for instance , model a and model b ( in the nomenclature of ref .",
    "@xcite ) display different dynamic exponent but the same static critical exponents for the second order phase transition in the @xmath311 model .",
    "equality of the static critical exponents for different dynamics ( i.e. , different dynamic exponents ) is a requirement of thermal equilibrium . since our work concerns here models that are driven our of equilibrium",
    ", such considerations do not arise .",
    "numerical solutions of the continuum stochastic equations of motion or simulations of equivalent lattice models should be able to verify our results . beyond immediate theoretical motivation ,",
    "our work sheds important light for more realistic problems , e.g. , population dynamics of a bacteria colony or a biofilm resting over a fluctuating surface or a fluctuating biomembrane .",
    "further , our results provide important insight for more biologically motivated problems , e.g. , population dynamics of a bacteria colony over a fluctuating surface , or in the presence of a macroscopic order , e.g. , in a nematic or polar active fluid @xcite .",
