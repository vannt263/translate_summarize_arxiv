    ": electromagnetism ] we prove that holds as a consequence of maxwell equations .",
    "this theorem provides an indirect but highly non - trivial evidence in favor of the bound ( [ eq:6 ] ) .    in section [ sec : general - relativity ]",
    "we first discuss the relation of the inequality with inequalities between size , angular momentum and charge recently studied in general relativity @xcite .",
    "then , we point out that a result of reiris @xcite proves inequality in spherical symmetry in general relativity .",
    "finally , we generalize this result and prove inequality , with @xmath12 , for time - symmetric initial data .",

    "the total energy of the system is given by @xmath47 where in line ( [ eq:61b ] ) we have used the definition ( [ eq:58 ] ) . to calculate the last term in ( [ eq:61b ] ) we decompose the domain of the integral in @xmath48 and @xmath29 .",

    "hence , we have proved that @xmath56 the first term in ( [ eq:10 ] ) can be computed explicitly using ( [ eq:11 ] ) .",

    "then , we finally obtain @xmath57 this equality proves inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) and also the rigidity statement : if the equality in ( [ eq:5 ] ) holds , then ( [ eq:18 ] ) implies @xmath58 and hence @xmath59 .",
    "note that the equality ( [ eq:18 ] ) implies the following estimate for the fields inside the domain @xmath22 @xmath60 where we have used that in @xmath22 we have @xmath61 .",
    "let us discuss the scope of inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) .",
    "the first important observation is that in inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) the energy @xmath4 is the total energy of the system , which in electrostatic is equivalent to the binding energy .",
    "that is , @xmath4 represents the work needed to assemble the charge configuration from infinity .",
    "inequality is clearly false if instead of the total energy we use the integral of the energy density on the domain @xmath22 given by ( [ eq:26 ] ) : for example , take the spherical shell of radius @xmath3 and constant surface charge density .",
    "then , the domain @xmath22 is given by the ball @xmath29 , but the integral of the energy density over @xmath29 is zero since the electric field vanishes in @xmath29 .",
    "inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) is not valid if we consider many disconnected regions and take @xmath7 and @xmath3 to be the corresponding radius and charge of only one region and @xmath4 the total energy of the system .",
    "the counterexample is the following .",
    "consider two spherical thin shells of constant surface density with radius @xmath62 and @xmath63 and total charge @xmath7 and @xmath64 .",
    "the separation between the centers is @xmath65 , and we assume that they do not overlap , i.e. @xmath66 . the total energy of this system is given by @xmath67 where the self energy of each shell is given by @xmath68 for a simple way to compute the third term in ( [ eq:29 ] ) ( namely , the interaction energy ) see , for example @xcite p. 75 . at the contact point",
    "@xmath69 we have @xmath70 take @xmath71 , then if the shells are close enough to the contact point , from ( [ eq:1 ] ) we deduce that @xmath72 but then @xmath73 and hence inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) is not valid for the shell @xmath62 if we take in ( [ eq:5 ] ) @xmath4 as the total energy and @xmath7 and @xmath3 as the charge and radius of the shell .",
    "an alternative and useful way to prove inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) in electrostatic is the following . by thomson s theorem the electrostatic energy of a body of fixed shape , size and charge",
    "is minimized when its charge @xmath7 distributes itself to make the electrostatic potential constant throughout the body ( see , for example , @xcite p. 128 ) .",
    "that is , the original configuration is replaced by a conductor with the same total charge and size which has less or equal energy .",
    "for conductors inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) is related with the capacity of the conductor , defined as follows .",
    "consider a conductor @xmath22 and define the potential @xmath43 by @xmath74 the capacity of @xmath22 is given by @xmath75 the capacity @xmath76 satisfies the well - known relation @xmath77 where @xmath4 is the total electrostatic energy of the conductor .",
    "then , for a conductor , inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) is equivalent to @xmath78 since , by thomson s theorem conductors minimize the energy , we have proved that inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) for general configurations reduces to the inequality for conductors .",
    "to prove we use the variational characterization of @xmath76 @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the set of all functions @xmath31 that decay at infinity and are equal to @xmath81 at @xmath36 .",
    "consider the following test function @xmath82 we have that @xmath83 and hence we can use ( [ eq:8 ] ) to obtain @xmath84    this characterization in terms of the capacity is useful to find interesting examples and estimates .",
    "in particular it allows to prove the following relevant statement : inequality is not valid if we replace the definition of @xmath3 by the area radius , namely @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the area of the boundary @xmath36 .",
    "note that the area radius @xmath87 represents perhaps the simplest definition of radius that can be directly translated into curved spaces .",
    "the following counterexample shows that even in flat space @xmath87 is not an appropriate measure of size in our context .",
    "consider a prolate conducting ellipsoid with radius @xmath88 and @xmath89 with @xmath90 .",
    "the capacity of this conductor is given by ( see @xcite , p. 22 ) @xmath91 and the surface area is given by @xmath92 we calculate the dimensionless quotient @xmath93 note that @xmath94 depends only on the dimensionless parameter @xmath95 .",
    "we take the limit @xmath96 @xmath97 and hence inequality ( [ eq:70 ] ) is not satisfied for @xmath87 .    with this example",
    "we conclude the study of inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) in electrostatics . from now on , we will deal with the full maxwell s equations ( [ eq:32])([eq:32v ] ) . as a preliminary step ,",
    "we prove inequality ( [ eq:76 ] ) with @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "this particular case will also be used in the general proof of inequality ( [ eq:76 ] ) .",

    "let @xmath3 be the radius of @xmath22 defined in [ d : r ] and let @xmath21 be the center of the corresponding sphere",
    ". then the following inequality holds @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the angular momentum of the electromagnetic field given by ( [ eq:24 ] ) with respect to the point @xmath21 .",
    "moreover , the equality in ( [ eq:27 ] ) holds if and only if the electromagnetic field vanishes in @xmath22 .",
    "note that inequality ( [ eq:27 ] ) is purely quasilocal , in contrast with the previous inequality ( [ eq:5 ] ) : in ( [ eq:27 ] ) there appears only quantities defined on the domain @xmath22 and not global quantities like the total energy @xmath4 .",
    "of course , since @xmath102 , inequality ( [ eq:27 ] ) implies the global inequality @xmath103 moreover , theorem [ t : ejr ] implies also a rigidity statement for the inequality ( [ eq:44 ] ) : equality holds if and only if the electromagnetic field vanishes everywhere .",
    "we estimate the difference @xmath104 the integrand of the angular momentum ( i.e. the angular momentum density ) satisfies the elementary inequality @xmath105 where in line ( [ eq:28 ] ) we used the inequality @xmath106 , in line ( [ eq:28a ] ) we used that @xmath25 is an unit vector and in line ( [ eq:28b ] ) we used the inequality @xmath107 . using this inequality ,",
    "we obtain @xmath108 we write the right hand side of the inequality as follows @xmath109 collecting these inequalities we arrive to our final result @xmath110 by the definition of @xmath3 we have @xmath111 on @xmath22 , and hence the integrand on the right hand side of inequality ( [ eq:7 ] ) is non - negative .",
    "this proves ( [ eq:27 ] ) .",
    "moreover , inequality also proves the rigidity statement : if equality holds , then the integrand on the right hand side of inequality ( [ eq:7 ] ) should vanish .",
    "then , for every @xmath112 that is not on the sphere @xmath113 we have that both @xmath14 and @xmath15 are zero . by continuity ,",
    "the fields are also zero on the points on the sphere @xmath113    the proof of inequality ( [ eq:27 ] ) ( but not the rigidity statement ) can be directly generalized to any classical field theory . it is a direct consequence of the dominant energy condition .",
    "let @xmath114 be the electromagnetic energy momentum tensor of the theory .",
    "the indices @xmath115 are 4-dimensional and we are using signature @xmath116 .",
    "for example , for electromagnetism we have @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the ( antisymmetric ) electromagnetic field tensor that satisfies maxwell s equations . consider a spacelike surface @xmath22 with normal @xmath119 .",
    "the energy is given by @xmath120 let @xmath121 be a killing vector field that corresponds to space rotations .",
    "the angular momentum corresponding to the rotation @xmath121 is given by @xmath122 choosing coordinates such that @xmath123 are spacelike cartesian coordinates on the surface @xmath124 and @xmath125 , then the space rotations are characterized by @xmath126 where @xmath127 is an arbitrary constant spacelike unit vector that represent the axis of rotation and the indices @xmath128 are 3-dimensional . for the case of the electromagnetism ,",
    "it is easy to check , using ( [ eq:4b ] ) , that the definition ( [ eq:13 ] ) coincides with ( [ eq:24 ] ) .",
    "assume that @xmath114 satisfies the dominant energy condition , namely @xmath129 for all future directed timelike or null vectors @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "denote by @xmath132 the square norm of @xmath133 , that is @xmath134 and define the unit vector @xmath135 .",

    "choosing @xmath138 and @xmath130 given by ( [ eq:52 ] ) , from ( [ eq:32 ] ) we obtain @xmath139 since @xmath132 is the square of the distance to the axis , we have that @xmath140 where @xmath3 is the radius a the ball that encloses @xmath22 .",

    "note , however , that we have not proved the rigidity statement as in theorem [ t : ejr ] .    finally , we prove inequality ( [ eq:76 ] ) for electromagnetism in full generality .    [",

    "the first one is the following .",
    "we pointed out that in that inequality was conjectured in @xcite using heuristic physical arguments and also the inequality can be deduced using similar kind of arguments .",
    "however , with these arguments inequalities and are deduced individually .",
    "these kind of arguments do not seem to provide a way of deducing the complete inequality , which is obtained here for first time using the bekenstein bounds .",
    "moreover , the arguments presented above suggest that there is only one universal constant @xmath127 to be fixed .",
    "this constant can be fixed analyzing a simple limit case , for example spherical symmetry , with @xmath12 .",
    "we are currently working on this problem @xcite .",
    "the second , and perhaps most important point concerns the rigidity of the inequality .",
    "the arguments presented in @xcite do not give any insight about what happens when equality is reached in .",
    "the bekenstein bounds provide such statement .",
    "let assume that the equality is reached in .",
    "since we have assumed that it is not a black hole we can use the hoop conjecture inequality to obtain @xmath173 but then we can use inequality to conclude that if the equality is reached in then the equality should also hold in . by the bekenstein bound , this implies that the entropy of the body is zero .",
    "hence we have the following rigidity statement for inequality : the equality is achieved if and only the entropy of the body is zero .",
    "in general relativity , this statement appears to imply that in fact the equality is achieved if and only if the spacetime is flat .",
    "we will further discuss this point in the next section .      in general relativity ,",
    "the inequality ( [ eq:2 ] ) was proved in spherical symmetry ( in a different context ) by reiris @xcite . in the following",
    "we generalize this result to time - symmetric initial data .",
    "the most important difficulty to study these kind of inequalities in curved spaces is how to define the measure of size @xmath3 .",
    "we propose a new measure of size which is tailored to the proof of theorem [ t : gr ] .",
    "this measure of size represents a natural generalization to curved spaces of the definition [ d : r ] used in section [ sec : electromagnetism ] .",
    "the definition of size and the proof of the theorem is based on the _ inverse mean curvature flow _ ( imcf ) .",
    "a family of 2-surfaces on a riemannian manifold evolves under the imcf if the outward normal speed at which a point on the surface moves is given by the reciprocal of the mean curvature of the surface . for the precise definition and properties of the imcf we refer to @xcite .",

    "the geroch monotonicity can be written in the following form .",
    "assume that the flow runs between a surface @xmath179 and a surface @xmath180 , with @xmath181 , then we have @xmath182 where @xmath183 is the scalar curvature .",
    "note that the dominant energy condition for time - symmetric data implies that @xmath184 .",
    "we will use inequality ( [ eq:41 ] ) in two steps .",
    "first , consider an arbitrary point @xmath21 and run the imcf from @xmath21 .",
    "since the data satisfy the dominant energy condition , an small sphere around @xmath21 has non - negative hawking mass .",
    "moreover , the assumption that there are no minimal surfaces on the data guarantees that the flow runs up to infinity ( even in the presence of singularities , see @xcite ) .",
    "then , using ( [ eq:41 ] ) we conclude that any level set of the flow has non - negative hawking energy .",
    "in particular , the surface @xmath185 that encloses the region @xmath22 used in the definition [ d : imcf ] , that is @xmath186 denote by @xmath187 the area of @xmath185 and the area radius is given by @xmath188 .",
    "in the second step , we continue the flow from the surface @xmath185 to infinity . following @xcite , we bound the integral of the scalar curvature in terms of the charge @xmath189 where we have used that the charge is conserved outside @xmath185 , since by construction @xmath185 encloses the region @xmath22 and by assumption the support of the charge density is contained in @xmath22 . using ( [ eq:77 ] ) and ( [ eq:41 ] ) we obtain @xmath190 using ( [ eq:43 ] ) we finally get @xmath191 in particular this inequality applies to the radius @xmath3 and hence inequality ( [ eq:36 ] ) follows .",
    "if the equality holds in ( [ eq:42 ] ) , then we have @xmath192 and hence we can use the same rigidity argument as in @xcite to conclude that inside @xmath185 the data are flat .",
    "we have obtained a similar kind of estimate as in the electromagnetic case in which @xmath193 is interpreted as the quasilocal energy inside @xmath194 .    comparing theorem [ t : gr ] with theorem [ t : em ] in electromagnetism",
    ", we see that there is no rigidity statement outside the region @xmath22 in theorem [ t : gr ] .",
    "the natural question is whether a similar statement as in theorem [ t : em ] holds , namely , the equality implies that the field is produced by a charged thin shell .",
    "however , it is likely that the charged thin shell in general relativity never saturate the inequality ( in contrast with electromagnetism ) .",
    "the reason is that the rest energy of the shell is now taken into account .",
    "hence , a stronger rigidity statement is expected for theorem [ t : gr ] : the equality holds if and only if the complete data are flat .",
    "we are currently working on this problem @xcite .",
    "it will interesting to include angular momentum in theorem [ t : gr ] .",
    "however , this appears to be a difficult problem .",
    "in particular it is not clear how to include angular momentum in the inequality using the imcf .",
