    "thanks to the out - standing developments in recent neutrino physics a rather clear picture of neutrino oscillation parameters is emerging .",
    "we know that there are two large angles in the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath10 and @xmath0 , and one small angle @xmath11 , and the mass - squared differences @xmath12 and @xmath13 are well determined by the global data from solar  @xcite atmospheric  @xcite , reactor  @xcite , and accelerator  @xcite neutrino experiments . a recent global analysis of world neutrino oscillation data can be found _",
    "e.g. _  in ref .",
    "despite these enormous achievements there are still important open questions related to neutrino physics , which have to be addressed by future neutrino oscillation experiments :    1 .   what is the value of the mixing angle @xmath11 ?",
    "2 .   what is the value of the complex phase @xmath6 in the mixing matrix ?",
    "3 .   is the neutrino mass ordering normal ( @xmath14 ) or inverted ( @xmath15 ) , _ i.e. _ , what is the sign of @xmath2 ?",
    "in contrast to the `` discovery phase '' , which was dominated by natural neutrino sources such as the sun or the atmosphere , the subsequent generation of oscillation experiments will be mainly based on man - made neutrinos , where the neutrino source is well under control . among the future projects are conventional beam experiments  @xcite , new reactor experiments  @xcite , superbeam experiments  @xcite , and eventually experiments based on a neutrino factory or a beta - beam  @xcite .",
    "a characteristic feature in the analysis of future long - baseline ( lbl ) experiments is the presence of so - called _",
    "parameter degeneracies _ , see _ e.g. _ , refs .  @xcite . due to the inherent three - flavor structure of the oscillation probabilities ,",
    "for a given experiment in general several disconnected regions in the multi - dimensional space of oscillation parameters will be present .",
    "traditionally these degeneracies are referred to in the following way :    * the _ intrinsic _ or ( @xmath16)-degeneracy  @xcite : for a measurement based on the @xmath17 oscillation probability for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos two disconnected solutions appear in the ( @xmath16 ) plane . * the _ hierarchy _ or sign(@xmath2)-degeneracy  @xcite : the two solutions corresponding to the two signs of @xmath2 appear in general at different values of @xmath6 and @xmath11 . * the _ octant _ or @xmath0-degeneracy  @xcite : since lbl experiments are sensitive mainly to @xmath18 it is difficult to distinguish the two octants @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "again , the solutions corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath21 appear in general at different values of @xmath6 and @xmath11 .",
    "this leads to an eight - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath11 and @xmath6  @xcite , and hence degeneracies provide a serious limitation in the ability to answer the questions 1 and 2 above .",
    "moreover , the fact that one speaks of a `` sign(@xmath2)-degeneracy '' illustrates that answering question 3 is difficult : determining the neutrino mass ordering is equivalent to resolving the sign(@xmath2)-degeneracy .",
    "several methods to resolve these degeneracies have been proposed , among them the combination of experiments at various baselines and/or @xmath22-values  @xcite , the use of spectral information  @xcite , the combination of @xmath23 and @xmath24 oscillation channels  @xcite , and the combination of lbl and reactor experiments  @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we discuss a new possibility to resolve the lbl parameter degeneracies , based on the data from atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "it is known that atmospheric neutrinos are in principle sensitive to @xmath11 and the neutrino mass hierarchy due to earth matter effects  @xcite in the @xmath1-like events  @xcite .",
    "these effects are most pronounced in the multi - gev energy range and for large zenith angles , corresponding to neutrino trajectories crossing the earth mantle or the mantle and the core .",
    "in addition effects from the solar parameters @xmath10 and @xmath12 on @xmath1-like events in the sub - gev energy range provide sensitivity to the octant of @xmath0  @xcite , and in principle even on @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "for a recent discussion of sub - leading effects in atmospheric neutrino oscillations see ref .",
    "it turns out , however , that atmospheric ( atm ) data on its own can never compete with lbl in many respects , such as the determination of @xmath25 , or @xmath18 .",
    "one reason is that they are limited by systematical uncertainties , _",
    "e.g. _  from the neutrino fluxes .",
    "however , as we will show in the following , due to the effects mentioned above atm data can break the sign(@xmath2)- and @xmath0-degeneracies in lbl data , and hence the combined analysis of lbl and atm leads to significant synergies .",
    "an important part of the future neutrino program are gigantic water cherenkov detectors at the megaton scale .",
    "apart from serving as detector for lbl experiments such a facility will provide unprecedented opportunities for proton decay , solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments , as well as for the detection of supernova and other astrophysical neutrinos .",
    "the projects under discussion are uno  @xcite in the us , a megaton detector in the frejus laboratory  @xcite in europe , and the hyperkamiokande project  @xcite in japan .",
    "if a lbl experiment with such a detector will be built atmospheric neutrino data come for free .",
    "therefore , our method provides a very efficient possibility to resolve the parameter degeneracies from lbl data , in contrast to the previously discussed methods , which in general are based on the combination of two or more expensive experiments .    in the following",
    "we will illustrate how the lbl+atm combination works by considering the phase  ii of the t2k experiment ( )  @xcite , assuming a 4  mw superbeam produced at the j - parc accelerator , and the 1  mt hyperkamiokande ( ) detector serving as the far detector for the lbl experiment as well as providing the high statistics atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "let us note that similar results are expected also for the other megaton detector proposals .",
    "furthermore , if huge magnetized iron detectors are available one expects similar synergies between lbl and atm data . for these type of detectors the ability to distinguish between neutrinos and anti - neutrinos will increase the potential of atm data even further  @xcite . in the present work we stick to the  water cherenkov detector",
    ", the potential of magnetized detectors will be considered elsewhere .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : technicalities ]",
    "we give some technical details of our simulation of the  experiment ( section  [ sec : t2k ] ) and of the atmospheric neutrino analysis ( section  [ sec : atm ] ) , and we describe the statistical methods used in the following ( section  [ sec : statistics ] ) . in section  [ sec : degeneracies ] we illustrate the lbl / atm complementarity by discussing the effects of parameter degeneracies for the lbl data ( section  [ sec : qual - lbl ] ) , whereas in sections  [ sec : qual - atm - th23 ] and [ sec : qual - atm - hier ] we consider the effects in atm data which allow to resolve the octant and the sign(@xmath2 ) degeneracies , respectively . in section",
    "[ sec : resolve ] we investigate in detail the ability to exclude degenerate solutions with lbl+atm data by performing a systematic scan of the parameter space of @xmath11 , @xmath0 and @xmath6 . in section",
    "[ sec : hierarchy ] we discuss the potential to identify the neutrino mass ordering , for the special case @xmath26 ( section  [ sec : hier - max ] ) as well as for the general case ( section  [ sec : hier - nonmax ] ) . in section  [ sec : octant - th13 ]",
    "we show how the sensitivity to @xmath11 is improved by resolving the @xmath0-degeneracy by atm data , and we summarize our results in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the following the label `` lbl '' refers to the phase  ii of the t2k experiment ( )  @xcite .",
    "we are assuming a high luminosity superbeam with mean neutrino energy of 0.76  gev , produced with a target power of 4  mw at the j - parc accelerator .",
    "the neutrinos are detected at a 1  mt water cherenkov detector , hyperkamiokande ( ) , at a baseline of 295  km and an off - axis angle of @xmath27 .",
    "we consider 2 years running time with a neutrino beam , and 6 years with anti - neutrinos , such that comparable event numbers are obtained for neutrinos and anti - neutrinos .",
    "our simulation of the  experiment is performed by using the globes software package  @xcite .",
    "we take into account realistic neutrino fluxes , detection cross sections , energy resolution , and efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "this experimental information is folded with the three - flavor oscillation probability , fully taking into account the earth matter effect .",
    "we consider all available information , from @xmath28 appearance , as well as @xmath29 disappearance channels .",
    "the signal events are given by @xmath30 and @xmath29 charged current ( cc ) interactions , respectively .",
    "we divide the signal into the total event rate , where the full cc cross section is used , and into the energy spectrum with free normalization , where only events from quasi - elastic scattering are used , since non - quasi - elastic events do not allow to reconstruct the neutrino energy .",
    "various backgrounds such as a @xmath30 contamination of the beam , @xmath29 neutral current events , and misidentification of muon neutrinos as electron neutrinos are taken into account , using information given in ref .",

    ". a crucial element of the analysis is to take into account the full three - flavor oscillation probability , including earth matter effects , as well as oscillations induced by the `` solar '' mass splitting @xmath12 ( for other three - flavor analyses see refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in our analysis",
    "we consider charged current data , divided into sub - gev and multi - gev @xmath1-like and @xmath38-like contained event samples ( each grouped into 10  bins in zenith angle ) , as well as stopping ( 5  angular bins ) and through - going ( 10  angular bins ) up - going muon events .",
    "details of our statistical analysis can be found in the appendix of ref .",
    "@xcite . together with the statistical errors , we consider theoretical as well as systematical uncertainties , where theoretical uncertainties are uncertainties in the original atmospheric neutrino fluxes and in the cross - sections .",
    "we are using the atmospheric neutrino fluxes from ref .",
    "@xcite , and flux uncertainties include total normalization errors ( 20% ) allowing for an independent fluctuation of neutrino and anti - neutrino fluxes ( 5% ) as well as @xmath29 and @xmath30 fluxes ( 5% ) , spectral uncertainty of the fluxes ( `` tilt '' factor ) , and an uncertainty on the zenith angle dependence which induces an error in the up / down asymmetry of events ( 5% ) .",
    "we also include independent normalization errors for the different contributions to the interaction cross section : quasi - elastic scattering ( 15% ) , single pion production ( 15% ) , and deep inelastic scattering ( 15% for contained events and 10% for upward - going muons ) .",
    "moreover , we include as systematical errors experimental uncertainties associated with the simulation of the hadronic interactions , the particle identification procedure , the ring - counting procedure , the fiducial volume determination , the energy calibration , the relative normalization between partially - contained and fully - contained events , the track reconstruction of up - going muons , the detection efficiency of up - going muons , and the stopping / through - going separation .",
    "the current atmospheric neutrino data sample from superkamiokande ( sk - i ) consists of 1489 days of data ( contained events ) with a detector mass of 22.5  kt , which gives roughly @xmath39 of data . in this work we are considering a data taking period for the lbl experiment of 8  years .",
    "we assume that the 1  mt  detector will be finished one year before the beam , and hence @xmath40 of atmospheric neutrino data will be available . for the atmospheric data sample used in our analysis , which we will denote in the following by the label `` atm '' , we scale the present sk - i sample ( 1489  days contained events , 1657  days of stopping , and 1678  days of through - going muons ) by a factor 100 .",
    "event numbers for various atm data samples for typical oscillation parameters are given in table  [ tab : eventnumbers ] .      in order to investigate the potential of the experiments described in the previous sub - sections we adopt the standard method for analyzing future experiments .",
    "first , artificial `` data '' is simulated by calculating event numbers for lbl and atm for some `` true values '' @xmath41 for the oscillation parameters @xmath42 .",
    "then a @xmath43-analysis of these `` data '' is performed to extract allowed regions for the oscillation parameters .",
    "it is important to note that in general the results will depend on the values adopted for @xmath41 .",
    "for all calculations we will use for @xmath44 and @xmath45 the best fit values obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and sign(@xmath2 ) , and show our results as a function of these parameters .",
    "furthermore , since neither lbl nor atm data allow an accurate determination of @xmath10 and @xmath12 we assume that these two parameters are known with an uncertainty of 10% from solar and reactor neutrino experiments .    if one is interested in the allowed range for a certain parameter @xmath48 for a given choice of @xmath41 , the function @xmath49 has to be minimized with respect to all other parameters @xmath50 except @xmath51 to take into account the correlations and degeneracies between parameters .",
    "this minimization is performed by using the globes software package  @xcite , which has been generalized in order to include the atmospheric neutrino code .",
    "let us stress that for both data samples , lbl as well as atm , a full three - flavor analysis including matter effects is performed .",
    "the only approximation is to neglect the ( very weak ) dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "since lbl depends in leading order only on the product @xmath52 fixing @xmath10 does not introduce any error , as long as the dependence on @xmath12 is properly taken into account , and for atm varying @xmath10 in the allowed range is expected to have a very small impact .",
    "apart from this simplification the full parameter dependence of both data sets has been taken into account .",
    "however , we assume that lbl and atm data are statistically independent .",
    "this might not be completely correct since both data sets are based on the same detector , and hence , uncertainties related to the detection process can introduce correlations between lbl and atm data .",
    "although such effects will have to be included eventually in the analysis of _ real _ data , we expect that such correlations introduce only very minor corrections to our present results .",
    "in this section we discuss the problem of parameter degeneracies for the experiment .",
    "first we note that for this particular experiment the @xmath53-degeneracy does not occur .",
    "it is known that for experiments operating at the oscillation maximum of @xmath2 the second solution in the @xmath54 plane can be disfavored efficiently  @xcite . moreover , spectral information is important , since @xmath6-dependent and @xmath6-independent terms in the oscillation probability show a different energy dependence ( compare eq .",
    "( [ eq : emuprob ] ) later in this section ) .",
    "thus it is difficult to leave the spectrum unchanged when @xmath6 is varied , and the @xmath55-degenerate solution , which implies a different value of @xmath6 , is disfavored .",
    "an illustration of the relevance of spectral information for the @xmath55-degeneracy in the experiment can be found in figure  5 of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , in the case of  we are confronted only with the sign(@xmath2)- and @xmath0-degeneracies .",
    "apart from the incapacity to determine the neutrino mass ordering and the octant of @xmath0 this leads to a four - fold ambiguity in the determination of @xmath11 and @xmath6 . the impact of the degeneracies can be appreciated in figure  [ fig : d - th - nonmax-2 ] , where the solid curves show the allowed regions from lbl data in the @xmath56 plane for an example - point with the true values @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and non - maximal values of @xmath59 .",
    "apart from the true solution , three degenerate regions are present , corresponding to the wrong octant of @xmath0 , the wrong sign of @xmath2 , and the wrong octant as well as the wrong hierarchy .",
    "let us introduce the following abbreviations to denote these four solutions : @xmath60     plane at 2@xmath61 , 99   @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 ( left ) and @xmath65 ( right ) .",
    "the solid curves correspond to lbl data only , and the shaded regions correspond to lbl+atm data .",
    "the true best fit point is marked with a star , the best fit points of the degenerate solutions are marked with dots , and the corresponding @xmath66-values of lbl+atm data are given in the figure .",

    "the sign in the second term is ` @xmath71 ' for neutrinos and ` @xmath72 ' for anti - neutrinos . since in the experiment matter",
    "effects are small this expression for the probability suffices to obtain a qualitative understanding of most of the effects in lbl data presented throughout this work .",

    "@xcite the location of the @xmath0-degenerate solution @xmath73  can be estimated from eq .",
    "( [ eq : emuprob ] ) in the following way .",
    "since the  experiment operates close to the oscillation maximum it is a good approximation to use @xmath74 .",
    "furthermore , for values of @xmath75 the @xmath76 term can be neglected . under these approximation solving the two equations",
    "@xmath77 leads to @xmath78 for the parameter values of the wrong-@xmath0 solution .",
    "for the example shown in figure  [ fig : d - th - nonmax-2 ] eq .  ( [ eq : fake - th13-th23 ] ) gives @xmath79 for @xmath64 , and @xmath80 for @xmath65 .",

    "these numbers are in good agreement with the actual fit shown in figure  [ fig : d - th - nonmax-2 ] .",
    "one observes that the @xmath0-degeneracy has a strong impact on the measurement of @xmath5 , however , it hardly affects the determination of @xmath6  @xcite ; the @xmath73-solution occurs practically at the same value of @xmath6 as the true one .",
    "this is in contrast to the sign(@xmath2)-degeneracy , which in general leads to a severe ambiguity for @xmath6 , whereas the @xmath5 measurement is essentially unaffected .",

    "( [ eq : emuprob ] ) that only the term in the second line is affected by changing the sign of @xmath2 .",

    "therefore , the full probability stays invariant under this transformation if @xmath6 is adjusted such that @xmath85 , which can be achieved for @xmath86 according to this reasoning we would obtain in the example plotted in figure  [ fig : d - th - nonmax-2 ] the value @xmath87 .",
    "although in this case the accuracy is not excellent , eq .",

    "furthermore , also the solution with the wrong mass ordering gets disfavored in the combined analysis , although in this case the ability to resolve the degeneracy is more subtle . in the following subsections we discuss the relevant features of atm data to resolve the degeneracies in lbl data .",

    "the sensitivity of atm data alone suffers from the fact that the wrong hierarchy can be accommodated by adjusting @xmath11 , but also the parameters @xmath0 , @xmath2 , and @xmath6 are important .",

    "however , there is very poor sensitivity to the mass hierarchy and to the octant of @xmath0 for lbl data alone . for atm data alone only for @xmath170 and a true normal hierarchy a reasonable sensitivity exists for the mass ordering , since in this case",
    "a big excess of @xmath1-like multi - gev events is predicted , which can not be achieved by any configuration within the inverted hierarchy . for all other regions in the parameter space",
    "the sensitivity of atm - only is rather poor , since the data can be fitted with the wrong hierarchy by adjusting the oscillation parameters . to benefit from the hierarchy sensitivity offered by @xmath11-earth matter effects in atm data the precise measurement of the oscillation parameters from lbl",
    "data is mandatory . in particular",
    ", it is necessary to know @xmath0 and @xmath13 at the 1% level , and a reasonable constraint on @xmath5 is required . hence , only the _ combination _ of lbl and atm data makes it possible to obtain a good sensitivity to the neutrino mass hierarchy .",
    "let us add that to benefit from the lbl+atm combination indeed a few @xmath171 of atm data are necessary .",
    "in particular we have checked that for exposures below @xmath172 the sensitivity to the hierarchy is essentially lost .",
    "finally , let us remark that the methods to resolve parameter degeneracies discussed previously in general involve the combination of two or more ( expensive ) experiments , _",
    "e.g. _  at different baselines or using different oscillation channels .",
    "in contrast , once a lbl experiment with a megaton cherenkov detector is built , atm data come for free .",
    "therefore , in addition to the interesting physics , the synergies between lbl and atm data offer a relatively economical way of resolving parameter degeneracies ."
