    "a classical view is that the lower metallic layer likely hosts the dynamo of these planets , while the upper molecular envelope accommodates the observed fierce zonal jets .",
    "higher densities , lorentz forces and ohmic diffusion would lead to a more sluggish dynamics in the metallic layer and confine the zonal winds to the upper region .",

    "@xcite show that even when the forcing is restricted to a shallow weather layer the jets may reach much deeper into the planet . @xcite , on the other hand , present an anelastic deep convection model where the equatorial zonal flow is geostrophic and the higher latitude jets are confined to the outer few percent in radius .",
    "saturn s magnetic field is very axisymmetric and strongly concentrated at higher latitudes @xcite which is incompatible with the results of a classical earth - like dynamo model",
    ". a stably stratified layer at the top of the dynamo region @xcite or a completely different dynamo driven by differential rotation @xcite are two proposed alternatives for the special situation encountered at saturn .    here",
    "we concentrate on jupiter whose field is very similar to the geomagnetic field so that the well - explored geodynamo models also seem to apply at first sight .",
    "these models typically adopt the boussinesq approximation where the mild @xmath1% density stratification of earth s core is simply ignored . in jupiter",
    ", however , the density increases by more than a factor of 5000 below the @xmath2bar level .",
    "while the stratification is mostly concentrated in the outer molecular envelope , the density still rises by about one order of magnitude across the metallic layer ( fig .  1 of * ? ? ?",
    "some newer numerical models therefore use the anelastic approximation which allows to incorporate the effects of the background density stratification while filtering out fast sound waves @xcite .    in an extensive parameter study ,",
    "@xcite ( hereafter referred to as gdw12 ) show that dipole - dominated dynamos are rather rare when stronger stratifications are assumed .",

    "for the larger density stratifications @xmath6 , a value that corresponds to an increase by a factor @xmath7 , no dipole - dominated solutions were found .",
    "this is attributed to the fact that the focus of convective action moves progressively outward in cylindrical radius when the stratification is intensified .",
    "once the convective columns are mainly confined to a relatively thin outer shell , a non - axisymmetric dynamo mode is preferred that has previously only been observed in mean field dynamo simulations @xcite .",

    "multipolar solutions with weaker magnetic fields on the other hand exist for all @xmath10 values which means that both types of solutions coexist below @xmath11 for identical model parameters , forming two distinct branches .",
    "this so - called bistability can be attributed to the fact that free - slip boundary conditions were employed @xcite .",
    "these conditions allow strong zonal winds to develop that compete with large scale magnetic fields . on the dipolar branch ,",

    "the classical separation of the dynamics for the two envelopes thus becomes questionable .",
    "@xcite argue that this has important consequences for the depth of the zonal winds which should remain confined to a shallow outer layer where the conductivity remains negligible .",

    "this reflects the progressive outward concentration of the convective motions and thus of the reynolds stresses driving the zonal flows ( gdw12 ) .    the dominance of coriolis forces at this relatively low ekman number enforces the taylor - proudman theorem and the intense zonal jets remain strongly geostrophic , i.e.  variations in the direction of the rotation axis are much smaller than variations perpendicular to it .",

    "the weaker multipolar fields created by the thin - shell dynamo allow the outer prograde jet to survive , albeit with a significantly reduced amplitude and a restricted width than in the non - magnetic simulations .",

    "the lorentz forces now have a harder time to brake the zonal flows since they act in a significantly reduced volume .",
    "dipole - dominated dynamo action only becomes possible when the retrograde inner zonal jet is already relatively weak in the non - magnetic simulations , which happens at stronger stratifications .",
    "the thin - shell dynamo mechanism generating the multipolar field for @xmath176% does not apply here , since it would have to operate , at least partly , in the weakly conducting layer where the magnetic reynolds number is now too low to support dynamo action . instead , a strongly dipolar magnetic field is generated in the deeper interior where it does not interfere with the remaining prograde outer zonal jet .",

    "the volume over which lorentz forces can efficiently brake zonal winds is even further reduced .",
    "dipolar solutions can only be found at even larger stratification than at @xmath142% where the driving of the inner zonal jet is yet weaker .",
    "the role of lorentz forces in defeating zonal winds and thereby enabling dipole - dominated magnetic fields also offers an explanation why larger magnetic prandtl numbers help .",
    "the reason likely is that larger @xmath157 values lead to stronger magnetic fields and thus stronger lorentz forces .",
    "we can also now interpret the highly time - dependent solutions with intermediate mean dipolarities . here",

    "to further test the theory that the zonal flows are decisive for the field geometry we ran a few @xmath94 cases with a no - slip outer boundary condition that largely prevents zonal flows from developing .",
    "the results are mixed and not entirely conclusive , which may have to do with the fact that other flow components are also affected by this change in boundary conditions . at @xmath151% , @xmath107 and @xmath180",

    "@xmath107 and @xmath180 , the suppression of the zonal flows by the no - slip condition is not sufficient to yield a dipole - dominated solution and the same is true at @xmath142% , @xmath162 and @xmath186 or @xmath163 ( cases 17 , 32 and 36 ) . in the latter two examples ,",
    "the particular thin shell dynamo described by gdw12 , rather than the stronger zonal flows , may be the reason for the multipolarity which could explain why the no - slip condition has no effect .",
    "we also varied the electrical conductivity profile in a few cases . increasing the exponential decay rate from @xmath187 to @xmath64 for two simulations at @xmath142% required a finer radial numerical grid and thus more expensive numerical simulations .",
    "the zonal flows in the weakly conducting layer were intensified in both cases , likely because of the further decreased weaker lorentz forces there .",
    "the type of solution , however , remained unchanged ( see cases 33/34 and 51/52 ) .",
    "we also tested a more realistic profile that models the approximately linear decrease of electrical conductivity in the metallic layer ( see fig .",

    "a multipolar dynamo where the outer parts of the shell play a sizeable role thus becomes unlikely . in jupiter , @xmath189 is generally significantly higher in the metallic region and only decreases below the critical value for dynamo action in the molecular envelope .",

    "this explains why the low convective magnetic reynolds number in the outer part of the shell has little impact on the dynamo mechanism for dipolar dominated solutions .",

    ", the volume over which the lorentz forces can act to balance reynolds stresses is more significantly reduced .",

    "@xcite argues that the magnetic field may assume a configuration where the poloidal field lines are aligned with the rotation axis in regions of strong zonal flow shear .",
    "since the shear is perpendicular to the rotation axis , this would minimize the @xmath21-effect and related ohmic dissipation .",
