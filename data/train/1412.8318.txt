    "complex organic molecules ( coms ) have a key role among the many molecules so far detected in space : since they follow the same chemical rules of carbon - based chemistry , which terrestrial life is based on , they may give us an insight into the universality of life .",
    "of course , large biotic molecules are not detectable in space , certainly not via ( sub)millimeter observations .",
    "however , to determine whether pre - biotic molecules may form in space , we first need to understand the basic mechanisms that form smaller coms . there is an extensive literature on the subject and still much debate on how coms may form in space ( e.g. herbst & van dishoeck 2009 ; caselli & ceccarelli 2012 ; bergin 2013 ) .",
    "two basic processes are , in principle , possible : coms may form on the grain surfaces or in gas phase .",
    "it is possible and even probable that the two processes are both important in different conditions for different molecules .",
    "acetaldehyde ( ch@xmath0cho ) has been detected in a large range of interstellar conditions and with different abundances , namely in hot cores ( blake et al .",
    "1986 ) , hot corinos ( cazaux et al . 2003 ) , cold envelopes ( jaber et al . 2014 ) , galactic center clouds ( requena - torres et al . 2006 ) and pre - stellar cores ( berg et al .",
    "grain surface models predict that ch@xmath0cho is one of the simplest coms and can be formed either by the combination of two radicals on the grain surface , ch@xmath0 and hco , which become mobile when the grain temperature reaches @xmath230 k ( garrods & herbst 2006 ) , or by irradiation of iced ch@xmath5 , co@xmath6 and other iced species ( bennett et al . 2005 ) .",
    "for the former route , the two radicals are predicted to be formed either because of the photolysis of more complex molecules on the grain mantles or , more simply , because of the partial hydrogenation of simple biatomic molecules on the grain mantles ( taquet et al .",
    "conversely , gas phase models claim that acetaldehyde is easily formed by the oxidation of hydrocarbons , which are produced by the hydrogenation of carbon chain on the grain mantles ( charnley et al .",
    "1992 , 2004 ) .",
    "finally , a further possible mechanism involving formation in the very high density gas - phase immediately after ice mantles are sublimated has been proposed by rawlings et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .    in general",
    ", it is very difficult to distinguish which of these three mechanisms are at work and , consequently , their relative importance .",
    "the chemically rich shocked region l1157-b1 offers a unique possibility to test these theories , as it is a place where the dust is not heated by the protostar , but some of the grain mantles are sputtered / injected in the gas phase because of the passage of a shock ( see e.g. fontani et al .",
    "the l1157-mm protostar ( @xmath7 = 250 pc ) drives a chemically rich outflow ( bachiller et al .",
    "2001 ) , associated with molecular clumpy cavities ( gueth et al .",
    "1996 ) , created by episodic events in a precessing jet . located at the apex of the more recent cavity , the bright bow shock called b1 has a kinematical age of 2000 years .",
    "this shock spot has been the target of several studies ( e.g. the large programs herschel / chess ( chemical herschel surveys of star forming regions ; ceccarelli et al .",
    "2010 ; and iram-30m / asai ( astrochemical survey at iram ) . in this letter",
    "we report high spatial resolution observations of acetaldehyde , with the aim to constrain and quantify the contribution of gas phase chemistry to the ch@xmath0cho formation .",
    "l1157-b1 was observed with the iram plateau de bure ( pdb ) 6-element array in april  may 2013 using both the c and d configurations , with 21176 m baselines , filtering out structures @xmath8 20@xmath9 , and providing an angular resolution of 2@xmath105 @xmath3 2@xmath103 ( pa = 90@xmath11 ) .",
    "the primary hpbw is @xmath12 .",
    "the observed ch@xmath0cho lines ( see table 1 ) at @xmath2 134136 ghz were detected using the widex backend which covers a 4 ghz spectral window at a 2 mhz ( @xmath2 4.4 km s@xmath13 ) spectral resolution .",
    "the system temperature was 100200  k in all tracks , and the amount of precipitable water vapor was generally @xmath2 5  mm .",
    "calibration was carried out following standard procedures , using gildas - clic .",
    "calibration was performed on 3c279 ( bandpass ) , 1926 + 611 , and 1928 + 738 ( phase and amplitude ) .",
    "the absolute flux scale was set by observing mwc349 ( @xmath14  jy at 134  ghz ) .",
    "the typical rms noise in the 2 mhz channels was @xmath2 0.7 mjy beam@xmath13 .",

    ", we produced the ch@xmath0cho(7@xmath156@xmath16 ) e+a spectrum summing the emission measured at pdbi in a circle of diameter equal to the half - power beam width ( hpbw ) of the iram-30 m telescope ( 17@xmath9 ) .",
    "we evaluated the missing flux by comparing such emission with the spectrum directly measured with the single - dish ( from the asai spectral survey , lefloch et al .",
    ", in preparation ) . as already found for hdco by fontani et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , with the pdbi we recover more than 80% of the flux , indicating that both tracers do not have significant extended structures .",
    "the spatial distribution reported in fig .",
    "1 shows that ch@xmath0cho is mainly associated with two regions : ( i ) the eastern b0-b1 cavity opened by the precessing jet ( called ` e - wall ' , see fig . 1 in fontani et al .",
    "2014 ) , and ( ii ) the arch - like structure composed by the b1a - e - f - b clumps identified by ch@xmath0cn ( called ` arch ' ) . the red , turquoise , and magenta polygons shown in fig",

    "note that b1a is in turn located where the precessing jet is expected to impact the cavity producing a dissociative j - shock ( traced by high velocity sio , h@xmath6o , [ feii ] , [ oi ] , and high - j co emission : e.g. gueth et al .",

    "the acetaldehyde emission is concentrated towards the ` e - wall ' and ` arch ' zones , namely the part of b1 associated with the most recent shocked material , as probed by the hdco emission .",

    "( 2012 ) and busquet et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . in summary ,",
    "similarly to hdco , ch@xmath0cho traces the extended interface between the shock and the ambient gas , which is chemically enriched by the sputtering of the dust mantles .    to derive the column density",
    ", we used the lte populated and optically thin assumption and best fitted the six detected lines of tables 12 . towards the b1a peak ,",
    "we find @xmath23 = 9 @xmath3 10@xmath24 @xmath25 , and a rotational temperature of @xmath26 = 15 k , in agreement with the value derived for the molecular cavity from single - dish co and hdco measurements ( 1070 k ; lefloch et al .",
    "2012 , codella et al .",
    "assuming rotational temperatures between 10 and 70 k ( table 2 ) we derived a column density of 530 @xmath3 10@xmath27 @xmath25 in the ` e - wall ' and ` arch ' regions , and @xmath2 23 10@xmath27 @xmath25 in the ` head ' .",
    "the size of the regions ( at 3@xmath28 level ) is 9@xmath9 ( ` e - wall ' ) , 7@xmath9 ( ` arch ' ) , and 8@xmath9 ( ` head ' ) .",
    "an estimate of the ch@xmath0cho abundance can be derived using the the co column density @xmath29 10@xmath30 @xmath25 derived by lefloch et al .",
    "( 2012 ) on a 20@xmath9 scale .",
    "we derived @xmath23 using the ch@xmath0cho spectrum extracted on the same scale and assuming 1070 k. we find @xmath23 @xmath2 0.91.6 @xmath3 10@xmath24 @xmath25 , which implies a high abundance , @xmath31 @xmath29 23 @xmath3 10@xmath4 , similar to what has been measured in hot - corinos ( @xmath29 26 @xmath3 10@xmath4 , cazaux et al .",
    "2003 ) , and larger than that measured in prestellar cores ( @xmath2 10@xmath32 , vastel et al . 2014 ) and towards high - mass star forming regions ( @xmath2 10@xmath3210@xmath33 , cazaux et al . 2003",
    "; charnley 2004 ) .",
    "the ratio between @xmath23 and the column density of hdco , i.e. a molecule which in l1157-b1 is predominantly released by grain mantles ( fontani et al . 2014 ) , is higher ( even if we consider the uncertainties , see table 2 ) in the ` arch ' with respect to the ` e - wall ' by a factor @xmath2 28 .",
    "assuming the same grain mantle composition and release mechanism , this difference suggests that , in the ` arch ' , a significative fraction of the observed ch@xmath0cho is formed in the gas phase . in the gas phase , the injection from grain mantles of ethane ( c@xmath6h@xmath34 ) is expected to drive first c@xmath6h@xmath35 and successively acetaldehyde ( e.g. charnley 2004 ; vasyunin & herbst 2013 ) : the overlap between the hdco ( fontani et al . 2014 ) and ch@xmath0cho emitting regions supports this scenario .",
    "we can , therefore , use the measured ch@xmath0cho abundance to constrain the quantity of c@xmath6h@xmath35 that has to be present in the gas phase in order to produce the observed quantity of ch@xmath0cho . to this end , we use the chemical code astrochem , a pseudo time dependent model that follows the evolution of a gas cloud with a fixed temperature and density considering a network of chemical reactions in the gas phase . we followed the same 2-steps procedure adopted in podio et al .",
    "( 2014 ) and mendoza et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , to first compute the steady - state abundances in the cloud ( i.e. t@xmath36=10 k , n@xmath37=10@xmath38 @xmath39 , @xmath40=3 10@xmath41 s@xmath13 ) ; and then we follow the gas evolution over 2000 yr at the shocked conditions ( i.e. t@xmath36=70 k and n@xmath37=10@xmath42 @xmath39 ) . to estimate the influence of a possibly larger gas t@xmath36 during the passage of the shock , we also run cases with temperatures up to 1000 k. we adopt the osu chemical network and assume visual extinction of a@xmath43 = 10 mag and grain size of 0.1 @xmath44 m .",
    "we assume that the abundances of ocs and co@xmath6 are also enhanced by the passage of the shock , namely their abundance in step 2 is @xmath45 = 6 10@xmath46 and @xmath47 = 6 10@xmath48 .",
    "similarly , we assume that the abundance of methanol in step 2 is 2 10@xmath48 , in agreement with the most recent determination in l1157-b1 by mendoza et al .",
    "( 2014 ) . finally , we varied the c@xmath6h@xmath35 abundance from 2 @xmath3 10@xmath49 to 2 @xmath3 10@xmath46 .",
    "as expected , the predicted steady - state abundance of acetaldehyde in the cloud is very low ( 1.5 10@xmath50 ) .",
    "however , once c@xmath6h@xmath35 is in the gas phase , it rapidly reacts with oxygen forming abundant acetaldehyde on timescale shorter than 100 years ( fig .",
    "3 ) . the ch@xmath0cho abundance reaches the observed value , @xmath29 23 @xmath3 10@xmath4 , at the shock age ( 2000 years ) , for c@xmath6h@xmath35 @xmath2 26 @xmath3 10@xmath49 .",
    "note that we obtain the same result if the gas temperature is @xmath51 k , and a 30% higher value at 1000 k. figure 3 shows also that the ch@xmath0cho / ch@xmath0oh abundance ratio is expected to drop between 10@xmath52 yr and 10@xmath38 yr . a different age could , therefore , justify the slightly smaller ch@xmath0cho / ch@xmath0oh ratio observed towards the ` head ' region .",
    "we have shown that acetaldehyde is abundant , @xmath31 @xmath29 23 @xmath3 10@xmath4 , in the gas associated with the passage of a shock and enriched by iced species sputtered from grain mantles and injected into the gas phase .",
    "the measured acetaldehyde abundance could be consistent with the scenario of oxydation of gaseous hydrocarbons formed in a previous phase and released by the grain mantles .",
    "however , the abundance of the c@xmath6h@xmath35 required to reproduce the measured ch@xmath0cho is very high , @xmath2 26 @xmath3 10@xmath49 , namely less than 0.6% the elemental gaseous carbon .",
    "there are no observations of c@xmath6h@xmath35 , hence it is impossible to compare with direct estimates of the abundance of this molecule .",
    "however , it has been argued that large quantities of frozen methane , of a few % of iced mantle water , is found around the l1527-mm protostar , where the detection of ch@xmath0d ( sakai et al . 2012 ) indicates @xmath53 @xmath29 0.41.5 @xmath3 @xmath54 .",
    "this large abundance has been attributed to a low density of the pre - collapse core from which l1527-mm originated ( aikawa et al .",
    "interestingly , the analysis of the deuteration of water , methanol and formaldehyde in l1157-b1 led codella et al .",
    "( 2012 ) to conclude that also the mantles of l1157-b1 were formed in relatively low density ( @xmath2 10@xmath52 @xmath39 ) conditions .",
    "to conclude , in the specific case of l1157-b1 , gas phase reactions can produce the observed quantity of acetaldehyde only if a large fraction of carbon , of the order of 0.1% , is locked into iced hydrocarbons .",
    "further observations of the hydrocarbons abundance in l1557-b1 are needed to confirm or dismiss our hypothesis .",
