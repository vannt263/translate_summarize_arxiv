    "it is a herculean task to inventory the contents of the universe ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a more modest goal might be to pin down the baryonic fraction of the total mass , @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "if objects can be identified which are likely to provide a  fair \" sample of @xmath3 , we may avoid the daunting prospect of having to identify all the guises baryons may assume .",
    "large clusters of galaxies offer a very promising site ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . to test the estimates of the systematic errors in @xmath3 derived from x - ray cluster data ,",
    "it would be of value to measure @xmath3 in a completely different system , provided a case could be made that it will provide a  fair \" sample .",
    "suppose , for example , we could estimate the baryonic mass associated with the galaxy . if we could also measure the corresponding ",
    "dynamical \" mass , we could obtain an independent estimate of @xmath3 whose systematic uncertainties ( and dependence on the hubble parameter ) differ from those which accompany the x - ray cluster determinations . in this paper",
    "we focus on the local group of galaxies ( lg ) , using the macho mass estimates ( @xcite ) for a lower bound on the baryonic mass and relying on lg dynamics to constrain the total mass estimate .",
    "microlensing experiments ( @xcite ) suggest that roughly half the mass in the halo of our galaxy , out to the distance of the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , may be in the form of massive compact halo objects ( machos ) .",
    "one can imagine several exotic possibilities for the nature of the machos .",
    "they could be very dense clusters of non - baryonic dark matter with special properties that allow them to clump inside their einstein ring radii ( @xcite ) , or they could be primordial black holes . neither of these possibilities is especially well motivated and each has its intrinsic difficulties , but neither can be excluded a priori .",
    "stellar remnants such as old white dwarfs appear to offer a more natural candidate ( @xcite ) which , however , is not without its problems too [ e.g. , white dwarfs require a rather narrow initial mass function in order to avoid overproducing low - mass stars or supernovae ( @xcite ) ] .",
    "dense and cold baryonic gas clouds have also been considered as a viable alternative for the observed gravitational microlenses ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally , it must be kept in mind that the observed microlensing may be due to objects which are not in the halo of the galaxy .",
    "if the machos are , indeed , stellar remnants ( or cold baryonic gas clouds ) in the halo of the galaxy , then the mass of baryons within 50 kpc of the galactic center is @xmath4 ( @xcite ) .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to extract information on the universal baryon fraction from this number assuming the machos are revealing baryonic matter in the galaxy halo , and from the dynamics of the local group of galaxies .",
    "the constraint we obtain may be compared to the one derived from x - ray galaxy clusters ( see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , but it relies on different observations in a completely different physical system on a vastly different scale and , interestingly , has a different dependence on the hubble parameter ( @xmath5  km  s@xmath6  mpc@xmath7 ) .",
    "the value of @xmath8 derived from microlensing experiments is approximately 50% of the total mass of the galaxy out to this distance .",
    "the latter mass , presumably the sum of baryons and cold dark matter , is derived dynamically ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . however",
    ", on the basis of this we can not conclude that the primordial baryon fraction is @xmath9 .",
    "baryons are `` strongly '' interacting particles , while for the ( non - baryonic ) cold dark matter all interactions except gravitational can be neglected .",
    "consequently , the density profile of the baryonic matter does not necessarily follow the density profile of the cold dark matter , and baryonic matter may be more ( or less ) concentrated towards the center of the gravitational well",
    ". however , we may be able to estimate the primordial baryon fraction if we take the ratio of baryons ( as revealed by the machos ) to the total mass on some larger scale , which should be sufficiently large so that the matter inflow or outflow across the boundary of the region is negligible .",
    "the total mass of matter residing in such a larger region can be found dynamically ; however , we can not measure the mass of baryons separately on such larger scales .",
    "although the baryonic halo may be expected to extend outside of the 50 kpc scale ( in the form , e.g. , of machos , diffuse gas , satellite galaxies , etc . ) , by neglecting these extended baryons we can obtain a lower bound on @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , while in the past there might have been violent processes of baryon ejection from the galaxy accompanying , e.g. , supernova explosions , analogous ejecta of cold dark matter is not expected .",
    "therefore , by neglecting the unknown ejected component of baryons we will be on the `` safe side '' in our inequality for @xmath3 , which , we emphasize , does rely on our assumption that machos are baryonic matter in the halo of the galaxy .    for the larger reference scale we can choose the current turnaround radius for the lg .",
    "initially , every shell of the galaxy s building material expands with the universe .",
    "gradually , this expansion slows down and eventually a gravitationally bound shell separates from the general expansion .",
    "this shell stops expanding and then collapses ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radius of this first stopping point is the turnaround radius . with the passage of time shells that are more and more distant and less and less bound turn around sequentially ,",
    "i.e. , the turnaround radius propagates outward with time ( for details see , e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 1997 ) .",
    "there is one shell that is turning around now , at present ; the corresponding distance of this shell from the center of mass of the system is the current turnaround radius .",
    "collisionless cold ( non - baryonic ) dark matter is restricted to remain within this radius , which is just what we want for the larger reference scale .",
    "this picture of infall is valid independent of the assumption of spherical symmetry ( the turnaround sphere will become a turnaround surface ) ; for the model to be tractable analytically , we do assume spherical infall .",
    "let @xmath10 be the current turnaround radius , @xmath11 the mass of all baryons currently inside this radius , and @xmath12 the total mass within @xmath10 .",
    "we are using the ratio @xmath13 to provide a measure of the universal baryon fraction , @xmath14 . for @xmath15  kpc",
    ", we expect @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , there may be more baryons that were initially associated with the galaxy than those that are currently within @xmath17 . as a consequence ,",
    "our estimate provides a _ lower _ bound on the universal fraction of baryons : @xmath18 .",
    "actually , in computing this inequality we do not have to use the current turnaround radius .",
    "it is equally legitimate , and will provide a tighter constraint , to take any smaller radius that satisfies the following condition : matter which is falling freely and is currently at this radius has not yet had a chance to cross previously collapsed material . in other words",
    "the shell is outside the first caustic of the spherical infall model .",
    "the position of the first caustic is model dependent , but it has its largest value relative to the turnaround radius if the initial overdensity causing the infall can be considered as a point mass excess .",
    "let us denote the radius of the first caustic as @xmath19 and the total mass inside of it as @xmath20 .",
    "in the point mass excess case ( and for @xmath21 ) , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , ( @xcite ) .    before shell crossing the radius of any given shell obeys the equation of motion @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the mass interior to the shell and @xmath26 is its binding energy per unit mass ; both are constants prior to shell crossing .",
    "solutions can be parameterized as @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "small galaxies in the local group that are close to the turnaround sphere can be considered as tracers of the motion of the corresponding shell .",
    "if the distances to such galaxies and their radial velocities are known at time @xmath30 , we can write , according to equations ( [ sol ] ) : @xmath31 using equation ( 3 ) we can solve for @xmath32 which is then used in equation ( 4 ) to determine the total mass @xmath25 interior to the shell on which the tracer galaxy resides .",
    "note that the derivation of the relation @xmath33 does not rely upon the initial mass distribution ( in other words we do not need to know the function @xmath34 ) . in the spherical infall approximation @xmath25 gives a direct `` weighing '' of the lg at each radius where a known satellite galaxy resides .",
    "we shall use this procedure for a subset of galaxies that are close to the turnaround surface .",
    "on the other hand , suppose that the initial mass distribution for unperturbed hubble flow is known , e.g. , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is an ( initially small ) excess mass over homogeneous cosmological background .",
    "a good example corresponds to the assumption of all excess mass concentrated at the origin , @xmath37 ( point mass excess ) . using the integrals of the equations of motion written as @xmath38 , we can find the velocity field at any given point , @xmath39 .",
    "the trajectory in the \\{@xmath40 , @xmath41 } phase space , @xmath42 , representing occupied cells at a given moment of time is called the infall trajectory .",
    "for example , if the initial overdensity is scale independent , @xmath43 , and for @xmath44 , the infall trajectory is given by @xmath45 the point mass excess case corresponds to @xmath46 .",
    "in the case @xmath47 the analytical expressions which give an infall trajectory are more complicated and we do not present them here .",
    "it is important , however , that at large @xmath40 the overdensity can be neglected and all infall trajectories tend to the simple hubble law , @xmath48 .",
    "it is convenient to choose as physical parameters which characterize an infall trajectory the turnaround radius , @xmath10 , and the hubble constant , h , which is the slope of @xmath49 at @xmath50 . when @xmath10 and @xmath51 are are fixed , the infall trajectories that correspond to different cosmological models , or different excess mass profiles , differ insignificantly outside of the first caustic",
    ". for comparison we plot infall trajectories for the case @xmath44 , @xmath46 and @xmath52 , @xmath46 in fig .  1 .",
    "the difference between the two cases is significantly smaller than the uncertainties in the measured galaxy peculiar velocities ( see below ) .",
    "either trajectory from fig .",
    "1 can be used in fitting the data to determine @xmath10 and h. for definiteness in our fitting procedure , we use the infall trajectory which corresponds to @xmath44 and assume its validity for the general cosmological model ( if , instead , we had used the @xmath53 trajectory , the change in @xmath10 would have been @xmath54% ) . to avoid confusion , note that in this approach eq . ( [ infall_trj ] ) can not be used to find @xmath55 ( this equation gives @xmath56 , as it should for @xmath57 ) , but @xmath55 has to be taken to match the underlying cosmology .    in applying spherical infall to the local group there is a complication .",
    "interior to the turnaround surface there are two large galaxies of roughly equal mass : the milky way and andromeda ( m31 ) , m31 being somewhat larger . in what follows",
    "we adopt , following peebles ( 1996 ) , for the ratio of their masses , @xmath58 . the derived mass and the turnaround radius of the lg will be a consequence of the gravitational pull of both galaxies .",
    "we assume that those tracer galaxies that are sufficiently far away are infalling to the common center of mass of the milky way / m31 system .",
    "we utilize @xmath59 modeling of the infall trajectory , eq .",
    "( [ infall_trj ] ) , for the whole sample of galaxies in the local volume ( excluding those satellites close to the milky way and andromeda ) .",
    "this may result in a more statistically robust determination of @xmath10 compared to the direct `` weighing '' at some selected positions through the use of equations ( 3 ) and ( [ sol2 ] ) .    in the spherical infall modeling of the local group defined in this way",
    ", m31 is used only to determine the lg center of mass and does not appear explicitly on the infall diagram . however , in the description of the m31/mw system another approximation can be made , namely that of two , isolated , mutually gravitating , compact bodies . using this approximation ,",
    "the total mass of the system can be derived .",
    "this is the so - called `` timing argument '' of kahn & woltjer ( 1959 ) .",
    "let us assume that , at present , the relative motion of the galaxy and m31 can be described as motion of two , mutually gravitating , compact bodies with masses @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "the conserved total energy of the system is @xmath62 \\ , , \\label{timing1}\\ ] ] where @xmath63 , @xmath64 is velocity of m31 as seen from the galaxy , and @xmath65 is the distance between them .",
    "this gives the equation of motion which is identical to eq .",
    "( 1 ) but with e being replaced by @xmath66 .",
    "since @xmath67 is unknown ( as is e ) , this variable can be replaced by another variable , @xmath30 , using solutions , eqs .",
    "( 2 ) . in this way eqs . ( 3 ) - ( 4 )",
    "are reproduced with the coordinates relative to the center of mass , @xmath68 , being replaced by coordinates relative to the galaxy , @xmath69 , and @xmath25 is the total mass of the mw / m31 system . using the observed values of @xmath70 and @xmath30 ,",
    "@xmath71 can be calculated .",
    "as we shall see , the mass calculated in this way exceeds the predictions of the spherical infall by about a factor of two .",
    "this is a serious internal contradiction in our modeling of lg dynamics and it has to be addressed .",
    "there are several caveats in the m31 timing argument .",
    "@xmath67 can be related to @xmath30 only if the equation of motion , eq .",
    "( [ timing1 ] ) , is valid at all times .",
    "but this is not generally true .",
    "the dominant galaxies started to grow from small initial fluctuations which were _ extended _ in space .",
    "their masses were not constant , but grew because of infall and the merging of smaller , progenitor galaxies .",
    "the `` timing '' approach can be modified assuming that @xmath72 , with the growth rate taken from the spherical infall model for each galaxy halo separately , and assuming that the resulting motion of galaxies can be described as the motion of point particles on an unperturbed cosmological background .",
    "however , there is a caveat to this approach too .",
    "the background can not be considered as unperturbed , especially at those late stages when large extended halos grow at the expense of surrounding material .",
    "the accuracy of the timing argument with respect to the neglect of finite size effects can be tested using the results presented by peebles et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , where lg formation was modeled using n - body simulations .",
    "the results of peebles et al .",
    "( 1989 ) can be considered as a generalization of m31 timing which accounts for the finite sizes and for the finite perturbations of the cosmological background .",
    "results were presented there for two values of the present age , @xmath73 gyr and @xmath74 gyr . for @xmath73 gyr ,",
    "the mass of the milky way / m31 system derived from the timing argument was @xmath75 , while the lg mass inside the turnaround surface measured in the n - body experiment was @xmath76 . for @xmath74 gyr ,",
    "the timing argument gives @xmath77 , while the mass inside the turnaround surface was found to be @xmath78 in the n - body simulation .",
    "the agreement is not very good , with m31 timing overestimating the mass inside the turnaround surface .",
    "the calculations of peebles et al .",
    "( 1989 ) were restricted to an @xmath79 universe ; we are unaware of analogous results for an open universe model . in contrast , the predictions of the spherical infall model are valid irrespective of the value of @xmath80 .",
    "last but not least , from our point of view the most serious drawback of the m31 timing is that it uses a single observation . since unknown peculiar velocities are inevitably present in the motion of any galaxy , the results derived from just one data point can deviate significantly from the mean .",
    "in contrast , when the motion of a large set of `` test particles '' is considered , which can be done in spherical infall modeling , the peculiar velocities may average out .",
    "for this reason we prefer the spherical infall approach to the m31 timing argument .",
    "unfortunately , not many galaxies are available for modeling the motion near the turnaround surface and it would be inappropriate to ignore the information provided by the motion of m31 . for these reasons",
    "we adopt the following procedure .",
    "we assume that all galaxies belonging to the local group have started in a common initial environment .",
    "therefore , we can try to relate @xmath67 in eq .",
    "( [ timing1 ] ) to @xmath26 which enters the equation of motion for the other , outlying satellites of the local group , eq .",
    "( [ eqm ] ) .",
    "( each satellite has its own value of e , determined by its initial position . ) in this way it is possible to put m31 on the infall diagram along with the rest of the galaxies . assuming two initial small overdensities ( one the seed of the galaxy , the other the seed of m31 ) on an otherwise unperturbed initial hubble flow",
    ", we find that the data points ( r , v ) , where r and v are the distance and velocity of the local group satellites as seen from the center of mass , along with the data point ( d , v ) , corresponding to m31 as measured from the galaxy , all belong to one and the same infall trajectory to a very good approximation .",
    "this procedure , which would overestimate the mass of the local group if there were an extra mass excess ( say , unseen matter residing in the center of mass ) , will be our basic approach to bounding mass of the local group from above .",
    "our basic assumption is that those tracer galaxies sufficiently far away are infalling to the common center of mass of the mw / m31 system . in addition",
    ", we have to make an assumption about the relative velocity of the milky way .",
    "we assume that , relative to the sample of sufficiently close galaxies , @xmath81 , the milky way also infalls to the common center of mass .",
    "however , the local group as a whole may be moving with respect to the more distant galaxies . to account for this possible local deviation from the hubble flow , we determine from our fitting procedure the milky way velocity relative to the sample of galaxies at @xmath82 , as well as",
    "the distance d itself .",
    "we utilize the @xmath59 approach to modeling the infall trajectory ; i.e. we look for the minimum of the sum @xmath83 ^2 \\ , \\ , , \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath84 is the measured velocity of @xmath85-th galaxy , @xmath86 is the unit vector pointing from the center of mass to the direction of that galaxy , @xmath87 is the unit vector pointing from the galaxy to the center of mass ( i.e. , according to our assumption , in the direction of m31 ) , @xmath49 is the infall trajectory , eqs .

    "relative to a set of galaxies with @xmath89 , the milky way velocity is assumed to be @xmath90 .",
    "m31 itself is included in this fit , as explained in the previous section .",
    "we do this modeling in  4.1 . for comparison , in  4.2 , we apply equations ( 3 ) - ( 4 ) for the direct  weighing \" of the local group , using the subset of galaxies which lie closest to the turnaround sphere",
    ".    we do nt expect the spherical approximation to be accurate for nearby galaxies with distances from the center of mass of the lg comparable to their distances from one of the dominant galaxies .",
    "we exclude from the fit eq .",
    "( [ chi2 ] ) the close satellites of either the milky way or m31 . on the other hand , radial infall in the direction of one of the dominant galaxies may be a good approximation for close satellites ( so that the satellite does not `` feel '' the other heavy galaxy ) .",
    "most such satellites are inside the first caustic of the infall model , where their trajectories are very model dependent",
    ". luckily , there are two satellites that might be just outside the first caustic . using eq .",
    "( [ sol2 ] ) , in  4.3 we derive the mass interior to these satellite galaxies under the assumption of radial infall to one of the dominant galaxies .",

    ".  [ rv2 ] , where the scale @xmath40 has been extended to 4  mpc .      in the analysis of  4.1",
    "we had assumed that the milky way infalls to the common center of mass of galaxies in the volume @xmath81 , while the velocity of the galaxy with respect to those galaxies in the volume @xmath141 mpc was fitted .",
    "this allowed us to account for the possible motion of the local group as a whole .",
    "when we neglected the local group velocity , i.e. , if @xmath142 was assumed , the quality of the fit became worse , i.e. , the velocity dispersion increased .",
    "it is interesting that the corresponding effect is very small in the present situation , when galaxy subclusters are removed .",
    "namely , by introducing the additional fitting parameters associated with the local group motion does reduce the scatter of the data points around the infall trajectory , while the velocity dispersion ( defined as @xmath143^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath144 is the number of data points and @xmath145 is the number of fitting parameters ) does not decrease .",
    "therefore , since the analysis is consistent with the assumption of negligible local group motion , we do not introduce the scale d here .",
    "another measure of the robustness of this assumption can be obtained in the following way .",
    "the velocity of the milky way can be found in fits with galaxy samples of varying depth .",
    "the direction and magnitude of the resulting best fit velocity can be compared ( for each value of the depth ) with the original assumption of infall to the common center of mass .",
    "this trend is shown in fig .",
    "[ apex ] for the angular coordinates of the velocity vector , and in fig .",
    "[ run_vel ] for the amplitude of the velocity vector .",
    "( for each subsequent point in figs",
    ".  [ apex ] and [ run_vel ] , the number of galaxies in the fit is increased by one . )",
    "we see that with respect to nearby galaxies , the milky way does infall to m31 to good accuracy .",
    "initially the direction is very close to the direction towards m31 , and the magnitude is consistent with our assumption in  4.1 that at distances @xmath146 mpc , @xmath147 . when the number of galaxies in the sample increases ( i.e. , going to larger @xmath40 ) , the direction of the milky way velocity drifts away from m31 , and the magnitude of the velocity vector increases for @xmath148 mpc",
    ". however , at @xmath149 mpc , both the direction and magnitude turn back and , overall , in this volume the peculair velocity of the local group is not significant .",
    "a similar analysis of the trend of the mw and lg apexes was done by karachentsev & makarov ( 1996 ) .",
    "their assumptions were different , however . instead of infall , eqs .",
    "( 5)-([chi2 ] ) , they assumed pure hubble flow for galaxies at distances @xmath150 mpc , and @xmath151 for galaxies at distances @xmath152 mpc from the milky way ( not from the center of mass of the milky way / m31 system ) .",
    "also , they included all close satellites in their fit . for these reasons , our results , shown in figs .",
    "[ apex ] and [ run_vel ] , while consistent with theirs , are differing somewhat .",
