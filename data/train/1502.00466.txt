    "charge transfer along double - stranded dna has attracted much attention among biomedicine , chemistry and physics communities in the past decade.@xcite as a specialized dna sequence , telomeres involve many essential physiological processes , dna damage , cell replication , aging , genetic stability and cancer.@xcite human telomeres consist of tandem repeats of the hexanucleotide @xmath2 5 - 10 kb in length 5-3 toward the chromosome end , terminating in a single - stranded 3-overhang of 100 - 200 bases.@xcite in normal cells , the telomere shortens with each cell replication .",
    "when a critical length is reached , cells undergo apoptosis.@xcite nevertheless , 80 - 90% of cancer cells preserve their telomere length by the activation of telomerase and thus become abnormal.@xcite interestingly , the g - rich sequence can fold into g - quadruplex ( g4 ) ( see in fig.1 ) , which is a secondary structure consisting of stacked g - tetrad planes connected by a network of hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and stabilized by centre monovalent cations , such as @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for",
    "human telomeric dna , the repeats of the telomere @xmath2 form the telomere g4 ( tg4 ) , where intramolecular g4 forms three - layer packet ( fig.1),@xcite which can form several topological structures .",
    "it has been found that the formation of tg4 inhibits telomerase activity , which obstructs tumor immortal mechanism.@xcite hence , tg4 has attracted extensive studies as an attractive target for cancer therapeutic intervention.@xcite    moreover , because of dna self - assembly properties , its paring specificity and conformational flexibility offer great potential for the rational design of dna - based nanostructure and nano electronics.@xcite different topological structures of g4 dna provide more possibilities for nano devices .    however , there are divergent opinons on charge transfer in the g - rich dna sequences .",
    "sugiyama et .",
    "believe that the g base is favor for charge transfer because the ionization potential of g base is lowest among the nucleobases.@xcite the numerical study also shows g4 dna favoring charge transport based on a simplified mono - g tight - binding g4 model.@xcite in fact , charge transfer in g4 could be quite different from normal dna due to the cation effect as a new hydrogen bond in g4 dna .",
    "barton s group found experimentally that g4 has great trapping potency on charges by chemical florescence method.@xcite actually , the problem of charge transfer in g4 is still open because of the complicated topological structures of g4 . the full understanding of charge transfer in g4 requires comparing different topological structures of g4 dna .",
    "however , it is not easy to compare functions of different topological structures of g4 by biomedical methods",
    ". physical method can provide a microscopic insight to understand the mechanism of the g4 functions in physiological process and charge transfer for nano devices .    in this paper we will study charge transfer in intramolecular tg4 by the effective tight - binding model with nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method .",
    "investigating the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristics of two predominant topological structures of tg4 in vivo , we find novel charge transfer properties of tg4 beyond the classical charge transfer law , which provide basic properties for designing g4-based nano devices and inspire a physical mechanism on the telomerase activation inhibited by tg4.@xcite",
    "the tg4 dna can be viewed as comprising of four parallel @xmath5 stacks for conducting charge channels through the superposition of @xmath5 orbitals along dna molecules , which is observed by the nmr spectroscopy and x - ray crystallography.@xcite we consider the two ends of g4 dna connected with two semi - infinite one - dimensional electrodes .",
    "the hamiltonian of g4-dna model can be written as    @xmath6    the charge channels in the backbone of g4 dna is very small and the @xmath5 orbit channel dominates charge transfer in g4 dna.@xcite thus , the effective tight - binding hamiltonian of g4 dna @xmath7 can be expressed as @xmath8\\\\\\nonumber & - & \\sum\\limits_{\\langle k,\\ell \\rangle \\in g_{4}}t_{m}\\left ( c_{k}^{\\dagger}c_{l}+c_{l}^{\\dagger}c_{k}\\right ) \\label{hg4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the on - site energy of each bases,@xcite where the second term is the ion effect in g4 packet , where @xmath10 is the distance between the ion and @xmath5 electrons , and @xmath11 is the effective dielectric constant.@xcite the second term in eq.([hg4 ] ) describes the @xmath5 electron hoppings between gs in g4 packet .",
    "the @xmath12 is the nearest @xmath13 electron hopping parameters listed in table i.@xcite the notation 5-xy-3 indicates the direction along the dna strand ( see , fig.1(b ) @xcite .",
    "the @xmath14 describes the hopping amplitude between gs in g4 packet .",
    "the @xmath15 in eq.([h ] ) is the electrodes at the left and right ends of g4 dna , @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{hlr}\\ ] ] the @xmath17 in eq.([h ] ) is the couplings between the g4 dna and electrodes , @xmath18 the @xmath19 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of electron or hole at k sites .",
    "the @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) is the on - site energy ( hopping parameter ) in the electrode , respectively . to minimize the contact effect",
    ", we use the optimal injection condition @xmath22and the strong coupling in the electrode @xmath23,@xcite where @xmath24 denotes a , c , g , and t.    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table 1 ]    since realistic dna molecules are under physiological conditions , we consider @xmath25 dna having water and ion environment .",
    "these water and ion environments of @xmath25 provides a stochastic electric field background to influence the @xmath25 structure as a stochastic perturbation .",
    "we introduce the @xmath26 describing these environment effects by the stochastic fluctuation of the @xmath27 structure .",
    "thus , the @xmath26 has the same form to @xmath28 , but the parameters are @xmath29 and @xmath30 , where @xmath31 describes the stochastic strength and @xmath32 randomly.@xcite    it should be remarked that we introduce the electrode such that we can calculate the i - v characteristic , which can be compared directly with experiments . for the case of g4 dna in vivo , suppose that the physiological environment provides an electric potential bias to g4 dna .",
    "thus , the situation of g4 dna in vivo maps similarly to the case we consider .    using negf method , the current can be expressed in terms of @xcite @xmath33(f_{l}-f_{r } ) \\label{i}\\ ] ] where @xmath34^{-1}$ ] is the retard ( advanced ) green s function ; the @xmath35 describes the level - width function , where @xmath36 is the retard ( advanced ) self - energy of electrodes .",
    "the @xmath37 is the fermi function of the left ( right ) electrodes .",
    "in general , the telomere sequence can be folded to many types of tg4 dna .",
    "the human telomere @xmath38 has been found to be folded to two topological structures ( tp1 and tp2 ) in vivo shown in fig.1.@xcite the tg4 packet as an basic element can be constructed to different configurations of tg4 dna , which can be classified into three classes , the consecutive mono(hybrid)-tg4(cm(h)tg4 ) dna , and non - consecutive mono(hybrid ) tg4 ( ncm(h)tg4 ) dna .",
    "moreover , we may compare the tg4 packet with and without ion .",
    "for convenience , we label the tg4 dna by @xmath39 or @xmath40 , where sn labels the telomere sequence @xmath38 ; the @xmath41 labels the tg4 topological structure and the last @xmath42 and @xmath43 labels ion and absence of ion .",
    "for example we define @xmath44 and when @xmath45 is folded to two tp1s and tp2s with ion .",
    "we label it by @xmath46 that is chtg4 . when @xmath45 is folded to one tp1 and two tp2 without ion .",
    "we label it as @xmath47 that is nchtg4 , where 0 labels the sequence of non - tg4 packet .",
    "( color online ) the sketch of two topological structures of tg4 dna in human vivo . ]",
    "in order to capture the basic physics of the charge transfer in @xmath48 , we first turn off the environment effects @xmath49 . for cmtg4 , @xmath50",
    ", it can be folded to only one tg4 packet .",
    "we compare the i - v characteristic of the s4 telomere chain and two topological structures ( tp1 and tp2 ) of tg4 with and without ion , namely @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , and @xmath54 , shown in fig.2 ( a ) .",
    "the s4 chain is of little conductance compared with cmtg4 .",
    "the @xmath55 and @xmath56 show semiconducting with the energy gap 0.3ev .",
    "the currents saturate at around 1v due to only finite states for molecule systems .",
    "the saturated currents of @xmath51 and @xmath52 reach 6na and 1na respectively , which is much higher than that of @xmath53 , and @xmath54 ( 0.06na ) .",
    "that means that the ion in tg4 enhances charge transfer . for longer telomere sequences , @xmath57 , and its cmtg4 , the basic behaviors of the i - v characteristics are similar to that of the s4 case , but the energy gaps for the non - ion cases",
    "are very small .",
    "the saturated currents of @xmath54 is larger than that of @xmath53 , but reverse for the @xmath58 case , which can been seen in fig.2 ( b ) .",

    "they are also semiconductor with @xmath62 energy gap and the saturated currents of the case with ion are much larger than that of the cases without ion .",
    "the saturated currents depend on the configurations of the topological structures of tg4 shown in fig.3 .",

    "the saturated current of the telomere chain is larger than that of ncm(h)tg4 .",
    "it implies that tg4 in ncm(h)tg4 can trap charges , which is consistent with the experimental results.@xcite    ( color online ) the i - v characteristic of ncmtg4 dna in ( a ) for the @xmath66 and @xmath67 , and in ( b ) for the @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 . ]    charge transport in ncm(h)tg4 exhibits novel topological properties . in common sense of charge transport in classical and quantum systems ,",
    "the global conductance of the system is proportional to the local conductance of the system .",
    "however , for nch(h)tg4 , the global conductance is inversely proportional to the local conductance .",
    "the conductance of tg4-dna system may be regarded as to be proportional to the saturated current .",
    "we find the conductance @xmath71 from results in figs.2 and 3 .",
    "when the telomere chain @xmath45 forms ncmtg4 , @xmath72 , the conductance becomes @xmath73 shown in fig.4 .",
    "it implies that the global conductance of ncm(h)tg4 is inversely proportional to the local conductance even though the local conductance @xmath71 . in other words , charge transfer in ncm(h)tg4 exhibits nonlinearity .",
    "the topology of tg4 induces the anomalous charge transport .",
    "we can understand these novel charge transfer properties in ncm(h)tg4 from quantum mechanics .",
    "physically , mobile charges form bloch wave in a periodic or quasi - periodic structures of cm(h)tg4 , while mobile charges in ncm(h)tg4 are trapped due to anderson s localization effect in disorder chain .",
    "that is why charges transfer favorably in the cm(h)tg4 .",
    "actually , dna sequence may be regarded as a quantum system .",
    "charge transfer in dna sequence has been found exhibiting some quantum nature.@xcite the anomalous conductance in ncm(h)tg4 we find is a novel quantum property of charge transfer induced by topology of tg4 dna .",
    "the charge transfer properties of tg4 dna can give a physical clue to understand tg4 how to activate or inhibit telomerase .",
    "it has been found that @xmath74 cancer cells obtain their immortality by activating telomerase to preserve the telomere length.@xcite the telomerase activation or inhibition is related to tg4 dna.@xcite the challenging problem is how to activate or inhibit the telomerase.@xcite suppose that the ligands of the telomerase offer an electric bias on the telomere dna to form a circuit inducing charge current . the topological structure transition from ncm(h)tg4 to cm(h)tg4 generates abruptly the charge current @xmath75 from @xmath76 ( see figs . 2 and 4 ) .",
    "this current as a threshold current can activate or inhibit telomease .",
    "this scenario can provide a clue to understand tg4 blockading the cancer cell immortal pathways and eventually perishing tumors in the biomedical experimental observation.@xcite this finding inspires a further challenging problem for biomedicine how to realize or control the topological structure transition between ncm(h)tg4 and cm(h)tg4 .",
    "( color online ) the ratio of the currents of cm and ncm tg4s at @xmath77 .",
    "we take 20 samples to give the average and the standard errors .",
    "the values of the ratios still remain @xmath78-order differences against the environment effects . ]",
    "it should be remarked that the ratio of the saturated currents between cm(h)tg4 and ncm(h)tg4 has @xmath78 orders .",
    "the solvent leads only @xmath79ev on - site energy fluctuation to dna bases , which can not lead to higher g4 structures.@xcite we investigate the environment effects in fig . 5 for two cases .",
    "when the environment fluctuation is small @xmath80 , the error bar of the ratio of the currents for the @xmath81 is larger than that of the @xmath82 , which implies that the current fluctuation depends on the detail configurations of the tg4 in the small environment fluctuation . when the environment fluctuation becomes larger , @xmath83 , the current fluctuation trends to be insensitive to the detail configurations of tg4 .",
    "more importantly , we do see that the @xmath78-order current difference induced by the topological structure transition from ncm to cm tg4s is robust against the environment fluctuation .",
    "moreover , it has been found that two basic mechanisms of charge transfer in dna chain , coherent tunneling ( hopping ) , and thermal diffusive hopping.@xcite the coherent tunneling or hopping occurs betwen @xmath84 pairs and the thermal hopping occurs in more than @xmath85 consecutive @xmath86 pairs.@xcite for tg4 ,",
    "@xmath2 , the coherent hopping dominates the charge transfer due to only @xmath85 consecutive @xmath86 pairs in tg4 .",
    "thus , the coherent transport method is valid for tg4 .",
    "in addition , the energy gap at fermi energy is about @xmath0 for tg4 , which is @xmath87 order higher than the influence of temperature fluctuation in room temperature , and the charge transfer in tg4 is not sensitive to temperature fluctuation because the coherent hopping dominates the charge transfer in tg4 instead of the thermal diffusive hopping .",
    "namely , temperature fluctuation in room temperature is not sensitive for our results .",
    "therefore , in room temperature all our conclusions are invariant .",
    "in summary , we reveal novel charge transport properties in tg4 dna . the cm(h)tg4 is semiconducting with @xmath0 energy gap .",
    "the conductances of different configurations of tg4 dna follow the inequalites , @xmath88 , where @xmath89 means telomere chain .",
    "the conductances depend on the topological structures and configurations of tg4 .",
    "the cation in tg4 enhances charge transfer . the tg4 packet in ncm(h)tg4 suppresses charge transfer , which agrees with the experimental results.@xcite",
    "the topological structure transition between ncm(h)tg4 and cm(h)tg4 induces a threshold charge current to activate or inhibit telomease .",
    "our findings not only reveal novel charge transfer properties in tg4 dna that can offer many opportunities for dna - based electronics , but also provide physical insights and hints to understand the telomerase activation inhibited by tg4 .",
    "the biomedical investigation found that tumor growth is related to the telomerase activation and inhibition .",
    "the telomerase activation and inhibition is related to tg4 .",
    "@xcite it implies strongly that states of tg4 could be related tumor growth even cancer .",
    "however , the biomedical investigation can not find the working mechanism of these three factors , tg4 , tumor growth and telomerase activation and inhibition .",
    "our results provide an understanding of the working mechanism of the telomerase activation and inhibition .",
    "we found that the topological structure transition from ncm(h)tg4 to cm(h)tg4 generates abruptly the charge current @xmath75 from @xmath76 ( 6 order difference ) when the ligands of the telomerase offer an electric bias on the telomere dna .",
    "it strongly implies that this abrupt current as a threshold current can activate or inhibit telomease .",
    "namely , if we can control the topological structure transition from ncm(h)tg4 to cm(h)tg4 we can control the tumor growth .",
    "this scenario can provide a hint to understand tg4 blockading the cancer cell immortal pathways and eventually perishing tumors in the biomedical experimental observation.@xcite consequently , the further challenging issue is how to tune the topological structure transition of tg4 by biomedical method , which is expected to further study .",
