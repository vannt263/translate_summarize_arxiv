    "at hera electrons and protons collide at a centre - of - mass energy of up to @xmath5  gev .",
    "these high - energy electron - proton interactions provide a testing ground for the standard model ( sm ) complementary to @xmath6 and @xmath7 scattering .",
    "the approach presented here consists of a comprehensive and generic search for deviations from the sm prediction at large transverse momenta .",
    "the present analysis follows closely the strategy of the previous publication from the h1 experiment  @xcite .",
    "all high @xmath8 final state configurations involving electrons ( @xmath9 ) , muons ( @xmath10 ) , jets ( @xmath11 ) , photons ( @xmath12 ) or neutrinos ( @xmath13 ) are systematically investigated . the complete hera ii data sample ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) is used , corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of @xmath2  pb@xmath3 shared between @xmath4 ( @xmath16 @xmath17 ) and @xmath18 ( @xmath19 @xmath17 ) collisions .",
    "all final states containing at least two objects ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) with @xmath20  @xmath21  gev in the polar angle range @xmath22 are investigated .",
    "all selected events are classified into exclusive event classes according to the number and types of objects detected in the final state ( e.g. , , ) .",
    "the criteria used in the identification of each type of particle are chosen to ensure an unambiguous identification , while retaining high efficiencies  @xcite .",
    "all experimentally accessible combinations of objects have been studied and data events are found in @xmath23 event classes . a precise and reliable estimate of all relevant processes present at high transverse momentum in @xmath24 interactions is needed to ensure an unbiased comparison to the sm .",
    "hence several monte carlo generators are used to generate a large number of events in all event classes , carefully avoiding double - counting of processes .",
    "the simulation contains the order @xmath25 matrix elements for qcd processes , while second order @xmath26 matrix elements are used to calculate qed processes .",
    "additional jets are modelled using leading logarithmic parton showers as a representation of higher order qcd radiation .",
    "the event yields observed in each event class are presented and compared to the sm expectation in figures  [ fig : yields](a ) and ( b ) for @xmath4 and @xmath18 collisions , respectively . in each class ,",
    "a good description of the number of observed data events by the sm prediction is seen .",
    "this demonstrates the good understanding of the detector response and of the sm processes in the considered phase space .",
    "distributions of the scalar sum of transverse momenta @xmath27 of all objects are presented in figure  [ fig : spt ] for @xmath4 data .",
    "( -30,-160)*(a ) * ( -30,-160)*(b ) *",
    "in order to quantify the level of agreement between the data and the sm expectation and to identify regions of possible deviations , the same search algorithm as developed in  @xcite is used .",
    "all possible regions in the histograms of @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions are considered . the number of data events ( @xmath29 ) , the sm expectation ( @xmath30 ) and its total systematic uncertainty ( @xmath31 ) are calculated for each region .",
    "a statistical estimator @xmath32 is defined to judge which region is of most interest .",
    "this estimator is derived from the convolution of the poisson probability density function ( pdf ) to account for statistical errors with a gaussian pdf , @xmath33 , with mean @xmath30 and width @xmath31 , to include the effect of non negligible systematic uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath32 gives an estimate of the probability of a fluctuation of the sm expectation upwards ( downwards ) to at least ( at most ) the observed number of data events in the region considered .",
    "the region of greatest interest ( of greatest deviation ) is the region having the smallest @xmath32-value , @xmath34 .     for classes with at least one data event , for @xmath4 data .",
    "the shaded areas show the regions of greatest deviation chosen by the search algorithm . ]",
    "the possibility that a fluctuation with a value @xmath34 occurs anywhere in the distribution is estimated .",
    "this is achieved by creating hypothetical data histograms following the pdfs of the sm expectation .",
    "the algorithm is then run on those hypothetical histograms to find the region of greatest deviation and the corresponding @xmath35 is calculated .",
    "the probability @xmath36 is then defined as the fraction of hypothetical data histograms with a @xmath35 equal to or smaller than the @xmath34 value obtained from the real data .",
    "@xmath36 is a measure of the statistical significance of the deviation observed in the data .",
    "the event class of most interest for a search is thus the one with the smallest @xmath36 value .",
    "depending on the final state , a @xmath34-value of @xmath37 ( `` @xmath38 '' ) corresponds to a value of @xmath39 , the negative decade logarithm of @xmath36 , between @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "the overall degree of agreement with the sm can further be quantified by taking into account the large number of event classes studied in this analysis . among all studied classes",
    "there is some chance that small @xmath36 values occur .",
    "this probability can be calculated with mc experiments .",
    "a mc experiment is defined as a set of hypothetical data histograms following the sm expectation with an integrated luminosity equal to the amount of data recorded .",
    "the complete search algorithm and statistical analysis are applied to the mc experiments analgously as to the data .",
    "this procedure is repeated many times .",
    "the expectation for the @xmath36 values observed in the data is then given by the distribution of @xmath42 values obtained from all mc experiments . the probability to find in",
    "the mc experiments a @xmath36 value smaller than in the data can be calculated and gives us the global significance of the observed deviation .",
