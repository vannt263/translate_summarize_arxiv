    "the gamma - ray burst ( grb ) has opened up a new window to probe high redshift universe , now reaching comparable redshifts with the studies by galaxies and quasars , and starting to probe the era of the cosmic reionization @xcite .",
    "the optical grb afterglow spectra give us a lot of information about grb host galaxies @xcite , intervening absorption systems along the line of sight @xcite and the reionization of the universe @xcite .",
    "grb  060206 is the 10th highest redshift grb as of 2008 november .",
    "grb  060206 was triggered by the @xmath5 burst alert telescope on 2006 february 6 at 04:46:53 ut .",
    "the redshift of the burst was determined to be 4.048 @xcite .",
    "the intervening absorption lines are reported at @xmath1 @xcite and @xmath62.26 ( aoki et al .",
    "2006 ; this work ) .",
    "surprisingly , @xcite claimed strong variation of the equivalent widths ( ews ) of fe   @xmath7 and mg   @xmath8 at @xmath9=1.48 ; the ew of the fe   @xmath7 system at @xmath1 showed a more than 80% decrease within 1.5 hours duration .",
    "it is difficult to interpret this system to be located in the grb host galaxy , because a large redshift difference requires relativistic motion and hence a large velocity dispersion of lines is expected , while the absorption line widths are only @xmath10 km s@xmath11 @xcite .",
    "then , almost unique possible interpretation is that the intervening absorption system is smaller than the image size of the grb afterglow , and the line strength changes with the size evolution of the grb afterglow .",
    "this requires the size of the absorption system to be less than @xmath12 cm @xcite .    this variability , if real , would change the standard picture of intervening absorption systems found in bright cosmological objects such as quasars and grbs .",
    "furthermore , this result has been used to support the mg   cloudlet hypothesis that has been proposed to explain the anomalous mg   incidence along the grb sight lines @xcite .",
    "@xcite reported that the incidence of mg   absorption lines along grb sight lines is about four times higher than that for quasars , at a statistical significance greater than 99.9% confidence limit , and this can not easily be explained by known selection effects . if the intervening line variability of grb 060206 is in fact due to the small size of the mg   cloudlets , the anomalous incidence of mg   systems may also be explained by the larger image size of quasars than grb afterglows .    however , grb 060206 is currently the only one case for the intervening line variability , and it should be examined carefully . here",
    "we report the analysis of the optical afterglow spectra of grb 060206 taken by the subaru telescope during @xmath13 6.019.73 hours after the burst , a part of which is overlapping with the hao et al.s observation ( @xmath13 4.137.63 hours ) .",
    "we will examine especially the line variability of the intervening mg   and fe   systems .",
    "in addition to the @xmath1 system , we will give detailed analysis of the @xmath14 system as well and examine the variability .",
    "when we completed most of this paper , the revised version of thne et al .",
    "( 2008 , arxiv:0708.3448v2 ) appeared on the preprint server , in which they also analyzed the same data from the subaru archive and reached a similar conclusion of no evidence for variability .",
    "however , details of the subaru observation and data analysis are not given in their paper . here",
    "we give more detailed descriptions about the observation logs and the processing of the subaru data taken by ourselves , as well as the implications for the mg   incidence problem .",
    "the @xmath14 system was originally reported by aoki et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and it is mentioned also in fynbo et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , but thne et al .",
    "( 2008 ) concluded that this is not real .",
    "however , we will show that this system is real , based on the detection of seven fe   lines and mg ii doublet .",
    "the afterglow of grb  060206 was observed on 2006 february 6 ( ut ) with focas @xcite attached to the subaru 8.2-m telescope @xcite .",
    "we obtained eight spectra of 30 minutes integration for each at 10:47 , 11:19 , 11:51 , 12:23 , 12:54 , 13:28 , 13:59 , and 14:31 ( ut ) .",
    "all these times are midpoint of exposures .",
    "we used the r300 grism with two different order - cut filters for the observations .",
    "the first three and last two spectra were taken with the o58 filter which covers between 5700   and 10200  .",
    "the other three spectra were taken with the y47 filter which allows an uncontaminated spectrum between 4800   and 9200  .",
    "the slit width was set to be .",
    "the atmospheric dispersion corrector was used and the slit position angle was .",
    "the spectrophotometric standard star hz  44 was observed for sensitivity calibration and removal of atmospheric absorption lines .",
    "it was photometric condition with good seeing ( - in @xmath15band ) .",
    "the seeing size became smaller as the grb was rising , and it was smaller than the slit width at the final epoch of the observations .",
    "consequently , the resolution of the grb s spectra was changed from 8.0  to 6.8   ( 290 km s@xmath11 to 250 km s@xmath11 at 8190  ) , which is confirmed by measuring absorption lines of a bright star found in the same slit for the grb afterglow .",
    "the data were reduced using iraf for the procedures of bias subtraction , flat - fielding , wavelength calibration , and sky subtraction .",
    "wavelength calibration was performed using oh night sky emission lines , and the rms wavelength calibration error is 0.2 - 0.3  .",
    "the sensitivity calibration was performed as a function of wavelength , and the atmospheric absorption feature was removed by using the spectrum of hz  44 .",
    "fringe pattern exists beyond 7700    in the spectra , and fringe spectra were made from the standard star s spectra normalized by its continuum .",
    "we divided the afterglow spectra by the fringe spectra , and suppressed the fringe pattern .",
    "the initial strength of fringe pattern is 611% of the continuum level of the afterglow spectra , but it is reduced by a factor of @xmath162 by this process .",
    "the foreground galactic extinction of @xmath17 mag @xcite was corrected .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] displays the optical spectrum of grb  060206 taken 9.7 hours after the burst .",
    "the absorption feature between 9300 and 9600   is residuals of the telluric absorption removal .",
    "the spectrum clearly shows the @xmath18 and @xmath19 absorption line systems which have been reported by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath14 absorption line system of mg   is clearly recognized .",
    "we also detected seven fe   resonance lines ( @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ) at @xmath14 .",
    "all these @xmath14 absorption lines are beyond 7200  and hence outside of the coverage of the wht / isis observation @xcite , explaining that @xcite could not find the absorption system at @xmath14 .",
    "we list all detected lines in table [ tbla ] in appendix . in figure [ fig11 ] in appendix",
    ", we show the spectrum combined all 4 hours data .",
    "we show fe   @xmath22 absorption line profiles at @xmath1 in our normalized spectra in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "no significant temporal variation is seen between 6.0 and 9.7 hours after the burst .",
    "the absorption lines at 9.73 hours after the burst are narrower than those at other epochs , but this is due to the change of the spectral resolution ; note that seeing size is smaller than the slit width at this epoch , as mentioned in section 2 .",
    "we also show mg   @xmath23 absorption lines at @xmath1 in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "no significant temporal variation is seen , either .",
    "we measured ew in the observer s frame for these lines by fitting each absorption line with a single gaussian .",
    "the gaussian fits are shown in figure 2 and 3 , and the ew results are tabulated in table [ tbl1 ] .",
    "figure 4 presents the time evolution of ew of these lines , and we confirm that there is no significant variation in the strength of all the four @xmath1 absorption lines .",
    "the difference between the first and last observations is 0.14   at maximum ( mg   @xmath24 ) , and that is smaller than @xmath25 uncertainty . the ew measurements of mg   @xmath26 , fe   @xmath272600.2 , and fe   @xmath272586.7 in the same subaru data performed by thne et al .",
    "( 2008 ) are mostly consistent with our measurements .",
    "however , we find that the ew of mg   @xmath28 in thne et al .",
    "( 2008 ) is significantly smaller than our measurement .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is not clear , although the conclusions of no evidence for variability are the same .",
    "the absorption line profiles of fe   @xmath29 , mg   @xmath23 , fe   @xmath30 , fe   @xmath31 , and fe   @xmath32 , for another intervening absorption line system at @xmath14 are shown in figure [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] , [ fig8 ] and [ fig9 ] , respectively .",
    "the absorption line at 8439    is al   at @xmath18 , and those at 7710   and 7748   are si   @xmath33 and si  * @xmath34 at @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the equivalent widths are measured in the same way as the system at @xmath1 , and the results are listed in table [ tbl2 ] .",
    "we do not find any systematic change of equivalent width in these all absorption lines at @xmath14 but one , either ( figure [ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the ew of fe   @xmath35 changed more than @xmath36 between 6.0542 hours and 7.065 hours . since the oscillator strength of fe   @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) is smaller than that of fe   @xmath35 ( @xmath39 ) , fe   @xmath37 is less saturated , and thus should be more variable than fe   @xmath35 .",
    "however , the ew of fe   @xmath37 was stable within @xmath25 . as seen in figure [ fig9 ] , fe   @xmath35",
    "was heavily blended with si  * @xmath34 at @xmath18 .",
    "this may cause larger uncertainty in ew , and large variation in fe   @xmath35 is doubtful . note that mg   @xmath8 is systematically stronger than mg   @xmath40 in figure [ fig7 ] , although the strength of mg   @xmath8 should be the same ( optically thick case ) as , or weaker ( optically thin case ) than , mg   @xmath40 .",
    "we noticed si   @xmath41 at @xmath18 is probably overlapped with mg   @xmath8 at 9130.5  . using the column density of si ( @xmath42 ) from @xcite , we estimated ew of si   @xmath41 to be 0.56   in observers frame ( optically thin case ) .",
    "we confirm that si   @xmath41 absorption line will be optically thin with the column density , the doppler parameter @xmath43 of 20 @xmath44 and the small oscillator strength ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we consider that the contamination of si   @xmath41 is likely the cause of a systematic increase of mg   @xmath8 in this result .",
    "in addition to the subaru data , the equivalent width measurements of the @xmath46 system by @xcite and the wht / isis data of @xcite are shown in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "our early four spectra are overlapping in time with the last three observations by @xcite .",
    "our ew measurement of @xmath1 fe   @xmath47 at @xmath13 6.011 hours is clearly in disagreement with the value measured by @xcite at @xmath48 6.15 hours .",
    "it should be noted that fe   @xmath49 at @xmath1 is clearly detected at 6415    in our spectra ( figure [ fig2 ] ) with an equivalent width of @xmath50  . on the other hand ,",
    "it is not mentioned by @xcite , and in fact , this line can not be clearly seen in the hao et al.s spectra .",
    "this indicates that an ew of @xmath51    can not reliably be measured by the hao et al.s observation , and hence the claim of the variability of fe   @xmath47 line should suffer from a large uncertainty .",
    "the hao et al.s spectra show a strong variability of mg   lines around @xmath52 hours , and we can not examine this variability because this epoch is not covered by our data . however , the early measurements of ews of these lines at @xmath53 by @xcite at @xmath54 hours are in good agreement with our measurements .",
    "it seems rather unlikely that the lines show a variability only in the time duration of the hao et al.s observation and no variability at all in the earlier or later data with higher signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "furthermore , there is no evidence for time evolution of ews in another absorption system at @xmath4 . from these results ,",
    "we conclude that the variability reported by @xcite is likely due to some artificial effects or statistical fluke in low signal - to - noise data .",
    "our result implies that the data of grb 060206 no longer provide a strong support to the mg   cloudlet hypothesis proposed by @xcite for the anomalously high incidence of mg   systems in grb spectra .",
    "furthermore , several difficulties of this hypothesis have been pointed out .",
    "one such argument is that apparently unsaturated mg   absorption lines with the doublet ratio of 1:1 are never found in intervening absorption lines , although such lines are expected if optically thick mg   cloudlets partially cover quasar beams @xcite .",
    "another argument is that there is no apparent change in mg   incidence over the continuum and broad emission lines of quasar spectra , although the broad line regions of quasars are much larger than the continuum emitting region @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that the suggested size of the mg   cloudlets is several orders of magnitude smaller than those derived from the observations of gravitationally lensed quasars @xcite .",
    "therefore , we consider that the mg   incidence anomaly is likely to be explained by some other effects . although the anomaly has not yet been solved , it could be explained , or at least the statistical significance of the anomaly is reduced , by a combination of some selection effects such as dust extinction and gravitational lensing @xcite .",
    "we are grateful to the subaru telescope staff for their assistance during our observations .",
    "this work was partly supported by the grant - in - aid for scientific research on priority areas ( 19047003 ) from the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) of japan .",
    "we identified absorption lines in the spectrum combined all 4 hrs data ( figure [ fig11 ] ) , but 1.5 hrs integration between 4800   and 6000  , and 2.5 hrs between 8800   and 10200  .",
    "the identifications , observed wavelengths in vacuum , and equivalent widths in rest frame are listed in table  [ tbla ] .",
