    "the system is fully described by two degrees of freedom , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , the classical system is fully solvable ( or integrable).therefore , the equations of motion can be integrated and the trajectories analytically described .",

    "thus ( see ref.@xcite ) , to the values @xmath53 and @xmath54 correspond different values of @xmath49 , namely @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "therefore , considering the above equation for the sets of states with angular momenta j=0 , 2 and normalizing the results to the energy of the first @xmath0 state , one obtains the following expressions for the excitation energies : @xmath57 where @xmath58      note that the model hamiltonian is highly anharmonic due to the terms of fourth and sixth - order in the quadrupole phenomenological bosons .",
    "despite this fact it is easy to see that this hamiltonian is diagonal in the boson basis @xmath59 , where the quantum numbers have the significance of the boson number ( @xmath60 ) , seniority ( @xmath61 ) , missing quantum number ( @xmath62 ) , angular momentum ( @xmath3 ) and its projection on the axis oz ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "these basis states have been analytically studied in ref.@xcite using alternatively different representations like , laboratory frame coordinates , intrinsic frame coordinates , boson variables . to prove the statement concerning the diagonal form of h in the mentioned boson basis , it is useful to write the fourth order term in a different form ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) which results in having a more convenient expression for @xmath21 : @xmath63 where the coefficient @xmath5 has the expression : @xmath64 from this expression it is obvious the @xmath21 commutes with the operators @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath51 , @xmath67 where @xmath66 denotes the casimir operator of the group @xmath68 : @xmath69 the eigenvalue corresponding to the state @xmath59 is : @xmath70 comparing this with eq.([enmj ] ) , we notice that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 , corresponding to a given @xmath3 , are characterized by two quantum numbers , namely the number of bosons @xmath60 and the seniority @xmath61 .",
    "therefore , using the new expression for energies one expects a better description of the data .",
    "for @xmath71 we use the lowest two values for seniority quantum number , i.e. @xmath72 , and obtain : @xmath73 similarly , for @xmath54 we consider the lowest two allowed seniorities , i.e. @xmath74 . the result is : @xmath75 note that within the boson treatment the lowest energy denoted by @xmath76 is equal to zero and therefore there is no need to renormalize the energies of excited states with respect to the ground state energy .",
    "let us now turn our attention to the missing quantum number @xmath62 .",
    "this quantum number labels the @xmath77 irreducible representations ( @xmath3 ) which appear in an @xmath68 irreducible representation ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the name is suggesting that there is no intermediate group between @xmath68 and @xmath77 whose casimir operator might make the distinction between different @xmath3 representations corresponding to the same seniority @xmath61 .",
    "@xmath62 labels the solutions of the double inequality for the integer number @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath78 the number of solutions for this double inequality is the degeneracy @xmath79 , characterizing the reduction @xmath80 .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath54 and fixed @xmath61 , the number of solutions of eq .",
    "( 2.21 ) is either 0 or 1 .",
    "for example , there is no state @xmath1 with @xmath81 .",
    "concerning the states @xmath53 , one has @xmath82 if @xmath83 with @xmath84 positive integer and @xmath85 otherwise .",
    "concluding , for @xmath86 there is no degeneracy , i.e. the set @xmath87 either does not exist or is uniquely determined by the relation ( [ ineq ] ) .",
    "the states @xmath0 can be related to the states @xmath1 by e2 transitions whereas the states of the same angular momentum are related by e0 transitions .",
    "since the e0 transitions for highly excited states are not yet experimentally investigated we confine our study to the e2 transitions .",
    "compact formulas for e2 transitions have been presented in our previous publication @xcite .",
    "however details about the derivation of these expressions were not given .",
    "here we complete the description of the e2 transitions by providing additional information which will facilitate a straightforward derivation of the results listed in the reference quoted above .",
    "we suppose that the leading contribution to the e2 transitions is provided by the linear boson term : @xmath88 the average of this operator with the coherent state @xmath20 ( see eq.([psi]))has the expression : @xmath89.\\ ] ] here @xmath90 stands for the kronecker symbol .",
    "the semi - classical energies have been obtained by quantizing the plane oscillator defined with the coordinates @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "thus , the energies depend on the total number of quanta along the two plane axes .",
    "it is convenient to use the polar coordinates associated to the cartesian @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "the principal and radial quantum numbers are related by : @xmath91 since the m - quantum number is equal to 0 for @xmath0 states and 1 for the states @xmath1 , one can use only one label for the intrinsic states @xmath92 :    @xmath93    using the explicit wave functions for the plane oscillator one calculates the matrix elements of the function @xmath94 . in the laboratory frame ,",
    "the transition operator is acting on both the coordinates @xmath95 and the euler angles @xmath96 and has the expression : @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the wigner function describing the rotation matrix .    in the liquid drop model the state of angular momentum 2 in the laboratory frame",
    "consists of two factors , one depending only on the deformation @xmath4 , while the other one is linear combination of the wigner functions @xmath99 with the coefficients @xmath100 depending on the deformation @xmath5 . in the present formalism by averaging the boson hamiltonian on the coherent state @xmath39 one obtains the equations of motion for the intrinsic variable @xmath95 which may be related to the deformations @xmath101 .",
    "therefore , we assume that in the laboratory frame the wave functions are factorized in the following manner : @xmath102 with @xmath103 .",
    "analytical expressions for the above b(e2 ) values as well as for some particular branching ratios were given in ref.@xcite .",
    "for a transition operator having an harmonic structure , the e2 transition between any two states @xmath1 is forbidden .",
    "this result is specific to the present semi - classical description .",
    "indeed , the matrix elements of the variables @xmath44 and @xmath45 between the states @xmath104 and @xmath105 are equal to zero due to the integration over the polar angle . in ref.@xcite",
    "we gave a group theory argument for this result .",
    "indeed , with respect to the pseudo - rotation group the harmonic transition operator is a tensor of rank @xmath106 while the states @xmath1 have the pseudo - angular momentum equal to 1 .",
    "then , it becomes manifest that two states @xmath1 can not be linked by an harmonic transition operator .",
    "of course , that is not true in the boson treatment , as we shall see in the next subsection .",
    "in order to get non - vanishing transition matrix elements between two different @xmath1 states we introduced an anharmonic term in the expression of the transition operator : @xmath107.\\ ] ]    the reduced matrix element between two @xmath1 states can be analytically obtained @xcite a peculiar feature of the present formalism is the fact that the anharmonic term does not contribute to the transition @xmath108 . on the other hand , as we have already mentioned , the harmonic term does not contribute to the transition @xmath109 .",
    "thus , the final result for the transition @xmath110 is proportional to @xmath111 .      in what follows",
    "we shall identify the missing quantum number with the integer positive number @xmath29 which satisfies the inequality ( [ ineq ] ) . in the intrinsic frame of reference , the states @xmath112 have a factorized form @xcite : @xmath113    where    @xmath114^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\left[\\gamma(\\frac{1}{2}(n+\\lambda+5))\\right]^{-\\frac{1}{2 } } \\beta^{\\lambda}l^{\\lambda+\\frac{3}{2}}_{\\frac{1}{2}(n-\\lambda)}(\\beta^2)exp(-\\frac{1}{2}\\beta^2).\\ ] ]    @xmath115 stands for the generalized laguerre polynomial . the functions @xmath116 are orthonormalized on the interval @xmath117 with the integration measure @xmath118 .",
    "we need the normalized functions depending on the variables @xmath5 and @xmath119 for the angular momenta @xmath120 and @xmath121 .",
    "these are @xcite : @xmath122,\\nonumber\\\\   { \\cal g}_{202}(\\gamma , \\omega)&=&\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}\\left[\\cos 2\\gamma d^2_{m0}-\\frac{\\sin 2\\gamma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(d^2_{m2}+d^2_{m,-2}\\right)\\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the intrinsic frame , the harmonic transition operator has the expression :    @xmath123    the reduced matrix elements of the transition operator between the states described in the previous section are calculated in appendix a. the reduced probability for the transition @xmath124 is obtained by squaring the corresponding reduced matrix element of the transition operator . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite the final analytical expressions are very simple .",
    "the equations derived in the semi - classical framework ( [ en01 ] ) for the energies of the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 were used to fit by a least square procedure the data for several nuclei : @xmath8gd , @xmath9dy , @xmath10er , @xmath11hf , @xmath12w , @xmath13os .",
    "the parameters , @xmath125 yielded by the fitting procedure are listed in table i. the fitting procedure provides also the set of quantum numbers @xmath126 associated to the states specified by the ordering index @xmath84 .",
    "of course the values of @xmath48 provided by the equations expressing the condition that the @xmath127 value is minimum are not integers .",
    "we assigned to a given energy level @xmath84 the integer which is closest to @xmath128 yielded by the least square equations .",
    "the boson description provides the expressions ( [ jeq0 ] ) for energies of the states @xmath0 , while for the states @xmath1 , eq.([jeq2 ] ) is determining the energies .",
    "these equations define four sets of energies which are depending on five parameters : @xmath129 . these parameters together with the quantum number n are to be fixed by a least square procedure .",
    "for comparison we performed the fitting procedure for the same nuclei considered in the semi - classical approach .",
    "amazingly , both procedures lead to a cubic expression in @xmath48 and @xmath60 respectively , although the two quantum numbers have different significance .",
    "indeed , the quantum number @xmath48 represents the number of the plane oscillator quanta associated to the intrinsic degrees of freedom @xmath95 related to the nuclear deformations @xmath130 . on the other hand",
    "the quantum number @xmath60 is the number of the quadrupole bosons which are describing the system in the laboratory frame .",
    "note that in principle both the boson number and seniority could be obtained by solving the least square equations but the procedure would be quite tedious . for the sake of simplicity we kept only the boson number as variable to be determined and chose the lowest seniorities .",
    "the reason is that for these seniority values the energy equation has a similar structure as in the semiclassical case . for the states @xmath0 we started with the @xmath131 expressions and tried to describe all energies as corresponding to @xmath131 .",
    "the result was that a set of calculated energies exhibit large deviation from the experimental data .",
    "these states were considered to have v=3 . in the next step both expressions , corresponding to v=0 and v=3 , have been used with the assignments determined before , and new least square equations have been written for the five parameters and the @xmath132 ( number of states ) values of @xmath60 ( boson number ) .    the results of the fitting procedures concerning the structure coefficients mentioned above are collected in table i . inserting the fixed coefficients in the equations defining the energies , one obtains two sets of energies for classical description and four sets for the exact treatment .",
    "the sets of energies are plotted as functions of @xmath48 and @xmath60 respectively in figs.1 - 16 .",
    "the four sets of energies , @xmath133 with the restrictions for @xmath60 mentioned above ( see eqs .",

    "a ) of the left and right figures the semi - classical energies for the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 are given .",
    "the full line curve is the energy as function of @xmath60 , with @xmath60 considered as a continuous variable .",
    "the integer number which lies closest to the experimental data is the assigned quantum number @xmath60 .",
    "we remark that the agreement with the experimental data is quite good for both semi - classical and the exact eigenvalues .",
    "the remarkable feature of our approach is that by compact formulas we obtain a realistic description of a large number of excitation energies , despite the fact that the number of the fitting parameters is relatively small .",
    ".the structure coefficients yielded by the fitting procedure applied to the semi - classical expressions for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 energies are given in the first four columns while the results for those involved in the exact eigenvalue expressions are given in the last five columns .",
    "all coefficients are given in units of @xmath134 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     concluding , the compact formula given by eq.(2.20 ) may describe a large amount of data despite the fact that only few parameters are involved .",
    "most of the data are described as low seniority states but for @xmath10er , there are also energy levels which correspond to high seniority states .",
    "finally , we remark that the least square procedure yields for the first excited @xmath0 state in @xmath10er , a value for the boson number equal to three . on the other hand in ref.@xcite , by means of a @xmath135 reaction",
    "a complete scheme of levels has been produced for @xmath136 and @xmath137 mev .",
    "the result is that there is no state @xmath0 with an energy smaller than 1.217 mev .",
    "thus , it is an open question which deserves further consideration , whether there are specific selection rules which prevent the population of the predicted @xmath138 state by the experiments mentioned above .    in @xmath11hf ,",

    "the theoretical results are plotted in figs .",
    "9,10 together with the experimental data .",
    "from there one notices that only few states of seniority 2 ( 1 ) and three ( 2 ) are found .    for",
    "@xmath139w one knows , from ref.@xcite , the energies of eleven @xmath0 and five @xmath1 .",
    "here we assigned the seniority 2 only to one state @xmath1 and seniority 3 only to two states @xmath0 .    for @xmath140w more",
    "states are experimentally known . indeed , in refs .",
    "@xcite the energies of sixteen @xmath0 and eighteen @xmath1 have been reported .",
    "the last nucleus investigated is @xmath13os for which we know seven energy levels @xmath0 and seventeen @xmath1 .",
    "experimental data are those from ref.@xcite .",
    "in the previous sections , we proposed two phenomenological descriptions of the excitation energies of the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 experimentally identified in several even - even nuclei .",
    "they correspond to two distinct ways of treating the same sixth - order quadrupole boson hamiltonian .",
    "one is a semi - classical description while the second one uses the exact eigenvalues . while in the yrast band",
    "the highest seniority states are the best candidates for a realistic description , for the states of the same angular momentum , the lowest seniority states are used for most states .",
    "we found , however , that some of the states @xmath1 of @xmath10er are higher seniority states .",
    "it is remarkable that both @xmath0 and @xmath1 states exhibit a cubic @xmath48 dependence .",
    "we know that such a behavior for energy in the yrast bands is determining a back - bending @xcite phenomenon for the moment of inertia as a function of the rotational frequency . here",
    "a back - bending also shows up but the cause is different from that determining the bending in the moment of inertia in the yrast band .",
    "the terms of the classical hamiltonian which do not depend on momenta define the potential of the classical system .",
    "this has been plotted in fig.17 for @xmath8gd and fig .",
    "18 for @xmath10er . for @xmath141 isotopes we used the parameters provided by the semi - classical treatment while for @xmath10er the two panels correspond to two sets of parameters obtained by classical and exact descriptions , respectively . from the upper panel of fig .",
    "18 we notice that some semi - classical states may accommodate the second well of the potential@xcite .",
    "the boson description yields a similar spectrum as the semi - classical method but with different structure parameters , i.e. those from table i corresponding to the columns with the exact solutions .",
    "the quoted parameters define a classical potential , given in the lower panel of fig .",
    "18 , which is very different from the one used in the classical picture .",
    "the discrepancy is caused by the high anharmonicities involved . actually , the two pictures , semi - classical and quantal , agree with each other only in the harmonic limit . comparing the potentials for the two isotopes of",
    "@xmath141 one finds a qualitative explanation for the behavior of the ratio @xmath142 which suggests that @xmath143gd is a good candidate for the critical point in the shape phase transition which takes place in the chain of @xmath141 even isotopes .",
    "it is worth noticing that for a long time , theoretical works were focused on explaining the high spin states in the ground band , but not so much was done about bands aside the ground state band .",
    "now we are confronted with a new situation . indeed ,",
    "to explain consistently very many excitation energies of states with low angular momenta is a real challenge for any theoretical approach .",
    "for example in @xmath10er a large number ( 105 ) of energy levels are experimentally known , 26 of spin 0 and 79 of spin 2 .    using a sixth - order boson hamiltonian we derived analytical formulas for the excitation energies of these states which involve a small number of parameters : four in the semi - classical treatment and five in the boson description .",
    "both sets of formulas are describing quantitatively quite well the existent data . in order to draw a conclusion about how these coefficients depend on the atomic mass",
    "a richer systematics is necessary .",
    "one may argue that for many of the states considered here , the single particle degrees of freedom prevail .",
    "actually we may share this opinion but , on the other hand , we think that the single particle behavior may be simulated by the anharmonicities involved in the present phenomenological model . some of the considered states may have collective features . it is worth mentioning that the present model is able to account for these properties shown by a deformed nucleus such as @xmath6 despite the fact that one uses a boson number conserving hamiltonian .",
    "our attempt is not singular in this respect .",
    "indeed , this is one of the signatures of the interacting boson approximation @xcite which is successful in describing rotational bands in non - spherical nuclei .",
    "moreover , the hamiltonian given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) with @xmath18 , has been previously used to describe the yrast bands in transitional and deformed nuclei @xcite .",
    "the results of the quoted papers show that some properties determined by the nuclear deformation can be described by a suitable choice of the structure coefficients multiplying the anharmonic terms .",
    "certainly , data concerning the electromagnetic transitions of these states are necessary in order to have an additional test and a more complete picture .",
    "a very nice test of the predictive power of our simple formulas was obtained by applying them to the newly found data for @xmath10er , by keeping the numerical values for the structure coefficients as obtained in our previous calculations .",
    "we showed that the new data are surprisingly well described by the same parameters set .    also , very simple formulas for the b(e2 )",
    "values characterizing the transitions between the states are derived within the two approaches .",
    "note that the expressions for the semi - classical transition @xmath144 and the boson transition @xmath145 are identical .",
    "of course the microscopic descriptions has the great merit of interpreting the data in terms of the single particle motion and may address some issues which are complementary to those accessible for phenomenological models . on the other hand in phenomenological pictures one may find a way to improve the microscopic description .",
    "indeed , in our formalism we have seen that the sixth - order boson term is necessary in order to obtain a quantitative description of the data .",
    "on the other hand an rpa treatment of a hamiltonian involving the mean field and a two body @xmath146 interaction , yields a quadratic boson term . going beyond qrpa by a boson expansion procedure ,",
    "higher order terms in bosons are obtainable .",
    "it is well known that the quadrupole two quasiparticle operator @xmath147 can be expressed as an odd powers expansion in bosons while the quadrupole quasiparticle density operator @xmath148 as an even power .",
    "therefore , ignoring the quasiparticle correlations due to the operators @xmath149 and considering the first - order boson expansion for the remaining terms , one obtains a sixth - order boson hamiltonian similar to the phenomenological hamiltonian used in the present paper . concluding one may assert that the phenomenological hamiltonian has actually a microscopic counterpart .",
    "on the other hand our calculations suggest that going beyond qrpa the microscopic model qpm might describe in a better quantitative way the existent experimental data .",
    "recently the states @xmath0 have been considered by the interacting boson approximation ( iba ) approach within the phase transition context and several analytical results have been derived @xcite .",
    "thus it was shown that in each of the symmetries @xmath150 , @xmath151 and @xmath152 the energies of the state @xmath153 depend linearly on @xmath48 in the regime of large values for the quadrupole boson numbers .",
    "several degeneracies of the states @xmath154 with the states @xmath155 have been pointed out for the critical values of the ordering parameters . in particular , the degeneracy @xmath156 might be viewed as a hallmark of the @xmath157 symmetry and moreover the ratio @xmath158 could play the role of the order parameter for the specific phase transition . for the symmetries characterizing the critical points of phase transitions , analytical expressions for the energies",
    "@xmath159 have been derived .",
    "the energy @xmath160 depends on @xmath48 as @xmath161 with x depending on the considered phase transition .    in order to make a fair comparison of the present results with those of ref.@xcite , analytical results of @xmath159 for any interaction strength of the iba hamiltonian would be desirable and moreover the same order boson hamiltonian to be considered . by considering in the expressions [ jeq0 ]",
    "the situation when the six order term is missing , i.e. f=0 , one obtains :    @xmath162    with x=@xmath163 .",
    "thus , one may say that the results of ref.@xcite may be recovered by the present formalism in the limit of @xmath18 .",
    "however , the six order term determines an additional minimum in the classical potential energy and therefore a new phase of the nuclear system is expected . moreover ,",
    "the cubic @xmath60 dependence may account for the complex structure of the energy distribution for the states @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
