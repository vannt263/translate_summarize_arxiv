    "impurity effects in spin systems have attracted considerable attention since the 1960s as a part of the broader interest in defects in solids@xcite and also in the context of percolative phenomena,@xcite to which diluted magnets provide excellent experimental realizations .",
    "more recently , the discovery of high-@xmath2 superconductivity in insulating antiferromagnets doped by mobile charge carriers has lead to an extensive research effort in various aspects of the problem , including role of disorder in quantum critical states,@xcite quantum percolation,@xcite and others .",
    "it has also been realized that impurities may serve as valuable local probes into the properties of strongly correlated systems in general , revealing important aspects of their electronic degrees of freedom.@xcite     plane .",

    "the dilution is achieved by chemically substituting isovalent zn@xmath16 or mg@xmath16 spinless ions for cu@xmath16 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : jznbonds](a ) .",
    "thus , it is only natural to expect that the proper low - energy model of la@xmath0cu@xmath17(zn , mg)@xmath18o@xmath1 must be the nearest - neighbor site - diluted heisenberg model,@xcite see fig .",
    "[ fig : jznbonds](b ) . in order to elucidate the properties of la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 diluted by spinless impurities , and of the associated site - diluted spin model",
    ", extensive experimental studies have been performed using nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) [ nuclear quadrupole resonance ( nqr ) ] , muon spin relaxation ( @xmath19sr ) , elastic and inelastic neutron scattering , and magnetometry.@xcite an equally comprehensive theoretical effort included the spin - wave @xmath12-matrix , quantum monte carlo , and numerical real - space @xmath20 calculations of a number of quantities that allowed for extensive cross - examinations.@xcite    one quantity in particular , the average magnetic moment per cu , @xmath21 , has been investigated in detail .",
    "the _ doping dependence _ of @xmath21 is the purely quantum effect related to the impurity - induced suppression of the order parameter because the normalization to the number of magnetic ions naturally separates the classical effect of dilution from it . while the overall results for @xmath22 vs @xmath23 show a reasonable agreement , a substantial discrepancy between the experiment and the theory , both analytical and qmc , has been observed .",
    "the experimental results indicate a substantially stronger  a factor of approximately 2suppression of the order parameter @xmath22 per impurity due to disorder - induced quantum fluctuations , and the experimental data for @xmath21 are also always below the theoretical curves.@xcite    in our recent work,@xcite a resolution to this problem has been suggested : impurities should not be considered as electronically inert vacancies that simply eliminate interactions among surrounding cu spins .",
    "in addition to the dilution , the hybridized electronic states of the impurity and of the nearest oxygens can provide extra degrees of freedom that generate longer - range frustrating interactions , schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jznbonds](c ) .",
    "such impurity - induced frustrating interactions can be expected to significantly enhance local quantum fluctuations . in ref .",
    "we have outlined our approach to the problem and presented our results for @xmath21 together with the complementary qmc results .",
    "the latter have unequivocally supported the same conclusion : the _ dilution - frustration model _ exhibits stronger suppression of the order and , for a choice of parameters appropriate for zn - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , bridges the gap between experiments and previous theoretical calculations based on the _ dilution - only model_. since then our theory has received further experimental confirmation from the @xmath19sr studies of spin stiffness in zn and mg doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1,@xcite which demonstrated a stronger suppression of spin stiffness in zn - doped case , in agreement with the expectations from the theory .    in this work , we expose the details of the derivations of the dilution - frustration model and of the subsequent analytical calculations of the doping - dependent magnetization .",
    "the key element of our theory is that it starts from a realistic model , the site - diluted three - band hubbard model , instead of already `` effective '' models of the cuo@xmath0 plane , such as the diluted heisenberg or the diluted one - band hubbard model .",
    "we begin with zn - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 within the framework of the impurity - doped three - band hubbard model , which closely describes the diluted high-@xmath2 cuprates and other transition - metal oxides on the energy scale of the most relevant atomic orbitals.@xcite similar to the derivation of the one - band hubbard model from the three - band hubbard model,@xcite the cell - perturbation approach is used to describe hybridization of the energy levels of cu and zn with oxygen orbitals .",
    "the approach does not require cu - o and zn - o hopping integrals to be smaller than the charge - transfer gap , therefore the locally hybridized states on cu or zn and surrounding o s are diagonalized without approximation.@xcite then the three - band model can be rewritten as a `` multi - orbital '' hubbard model with the effective `` cu '' and `` zn '' states connected by effective hoppings . since the structure of the lowest states in the single - particle and two - particle sectors of the multi - orbital model is the same as in the one - band hubbard model ( _ i.e. _ the lowest two - hole state is the zhang - rice - like singlet ) , the equivalence of the two models can be justified.@xcite in this approach , for the dilution - only picture to be valid the effective `` zn''-states must not occur below the effective hubbard @xmath4 , the situation more likely to be valid for the case of mg - doping due to the lack of available electronic states on mg ion .",
    "for the case of zn - doping , its electronic states@xcite hybridize with the states on the oxygen orbitals and can result in the states _ below _ the hubbard energy gap .",
    "this provides surrounding cu - spins with additional virtual states to execute their superexchange processes through , thus facilitating extra couplings that connect spins in the immediate vicinity of impurity .",
    "therefore , the spinless impurity , in effect , can lead to a cage of frustrating interactions around itself , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jznbonds](c ) .    for the sake of a qualitative picture , and in the spirit of mapping of the multi - band hubbard model onto the single - band one , the result of this consideration is that the impurity - doped system is _ not _ equivalent to the site - diluted hubbard model with electronically inert impurity sites , but rather to the @xmath24-@xmath3-@xmath4 model , where in addition to the usual hopping @xmath24 and the two - particle energy gap @xmath4 there is the lowest energy state of the effective impurity sector , denoted as @xmath3 . at half - filling ,",
    "the @xmath24-@xmath4 part reduces to the heisenberg model with @xmath25 , as usual , with the higher - order terms @xmath26 negligible if @xmath27.@xcite virtual transitions through the effective impurity level @xmath3 generate superexchange interactions of the order of @xmath7 between the next- and the next - next - nearest - neighbor cu - spins ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) that are also nearest - neighbors of the impurity site .",
    "when the energy at the impurity site @xmath3 is less than the hubbard gap , such terms are not negligible and may be comparable to @xmath8 .",
    "for an estimate , taking @xmath28 and @xmath29 gives @xmath30 , and , given the geometry of the square lattice , the combined effect per impurity is @xmath31 .",
    "the origin of @xmath9 and @xmath10 is clearly distinct from the generally considered next- and next - next - nearest - neighbor superexchange interaction ( @xmath32 and @xmath33 ) , which are of the order of @xmath34 and do not affect the order parameter specifically due to dilution.@xcite    while the technical details and the effort of the present work are more involved , this qualitative @xmath24-@xmath3-@xmath4 model properly reflects the key idea of our approach . in practice",
    ", we perform a similar type of the 4@xmath35-order expansion@xcite of the multi - orbital hubbard model , keeping track of all the relevant one- and two - hole states of the model and their dependencies on the original three - band model parameters .",
    "this allows us to perform a detailed microscopic calculations of @xmath36 and @xmath37 and estimate their values .",
    "since the experimental value of the nearest - neighbor superexchange for la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is known ( @xmath38ev ) , it can be used to narrow down the range of parameters of the three - band model as was done previously.@xcite although the electronic parameters of zn states , such as the energy of the bare zn - level and the zn - o hybridization , are not known precisely,@xcite we vary them to verify that the energy of the lowest impurity level @xmath3 indeed falls comfortably below the effective hubbard @xmath4 for a wide and reasonable range of both parameters . by projecting the multi - orbital hubbard model onto the low - energy spin - only model ,",
    "we analyze possible value of the total frustrating effect per impurity and find it to be between @xmath39 for the same range of parameters .",
    "in addition , we also provide a detailed analysis of the individual processes that contribute to @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "specifically , we have found that , counterintuitively , the longer - ranged @xmath10 is greater than @xmath9 .",
    "this is due to a subtle cancellation between the `` regular '' 4@xmath35-order superexchange processes and the analogs of the ring - exchange - type processes involving zn and three cu sites on a nearest - neighbor plaquette , see fig .",
    "[ fig : jznbonds](a ) , with the latter contributing to @xmath9 , but not to @xmath10 .",
    "that results in a _",
    "stronger _ frustrating coupling between copper spins across the zn - site , with the ratio @xmath40 in a wide range of the three - band model parameters .",
    "altogether , the calculation based on the three - band model , albeit more involved , provides a strong support to our central idea and gives an order - of - magnitude estimate of the frustrating terms in the dilution - frustration model .    upon establishing the structure of the low - energy spin - only model for the diluted system , to which we refer to as to the _ dilution - frustration model _ , we investigate the impact of impurities in this model on the order parameter @xmath22 .",
    "this is achieved by means of the analytical @xmath12-matrix approach within the spin - wave approximation based on the exact diagrammatic treatment of the impurity scattering amplitudes and subsequent disorder averaging .",
    "technically , we closely follow the approach of refs .  .",
    "first , we apply the spin - wave approximation to rewrite the dilution - frustration model on the 2d square lattice . after the fourier and bogolyubov transformation we decompose the impurity scattering matrices into the @xmath41- , @xmath42- , @xmath43-wave orthogonal components with respect to the scattering site .",
    "then , the @xmath12-matrix approach is used to solve exactly the problem of scattering off one impurity in each of the scattering channels .",
    "the subsequent disorder - averaging approximates impurities as independent random scatterers and effectively restores translational invariance for spin excitations propagating in an effective medium .",
    "such an approximation neglects impurity - impurity interaction effects , which are expected to be small at small doping .",
    "disorder averaging extends the @xmath12-matrix approach to the finite impurity concentration and yields the spin - wave self - energies as simply related to the forward scattering components of the @xmath12-matrix .",
    "next , for the given impurity concentration and values of frustrating parameters , the on - site ordered magnetic moment @xmath22 is calculated from the renormalized magnon green s functions .",
    "compared to the dilution - only model , the modification of this method for the dilution - frustration model concerns changes in the @xmath42- and @xmath43-wave scattering channels , while the @xmath41-wave channel can be shown to be unaffected by the frustrating terms . generally , the advantage of the @xmath12-matrix method is that it offers a systematic way of studying the order parameter @xmath22 as a function of the concentration @xmath23 and of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "one of the unusual findings in this study is that the next - next - nearest neighbor @xmath37 frustrating bond suppresses the order as effectively as two next - nearest @xmath44 bonds of the same strength .",
    "this result has also been supported by the qmc calculations , as was discussed previously.@xcite given that according to the three - band model calculations the @xmath37-term is larger than the @xmath44-term , this finding underscores its importance for the mechanism of impurity - enhanced suppression of the order parameter .",
    "we find that the experimental rate of suppression of the order in zn - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 is met by the @xmath12-matrix results of the dilution - frustration model at @xmath45 if we fix the ratio of the two frustrating terms to 2 , @xmath46 , or at @xmath47 for @xmath48 , according to the three - band model results . as was discussed in our previous work,@xcite qmc results seem to suggest a somewhat higher value @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , although they are obtained from the finite - size extrapolations that may overestimate @xmath51 .",
    "both the @xmath12-matrix and the qmc results correspond to a modest amount of frustration , well within the window suggested by the three - band model calculations . with our analytical and numerical results agreeing quantitatively with each other ,",
    "we have suggested further high - precision experiments at low doping .",
    "one of such experimental confirmations has come recently from the @xmath19sr studies of zn- and mg - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1,@xcite which has shown a substantially stronger suppression of the spin stiffness in the case of zn - doping , in agreement with the expectations from our theory .",

    "in this section , we derive an effective low - energy model for the zn - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 at half - filling .",
    "we begin with the consideration of the realistic , zn - diluted three - band hubbard model , which contains additional impurity states associated with zn . using wannier - orthogonalization for o - orbitals and a more natural language of the locally hybridized cuo@xmath1 and zno@xmath1 states , we first rewrite the three - band hamiltonian as the multi - orbital hubbard model .",
    "we discuss the new feature of the model  the hybridized zn and o orbitals can result in an impurity state with the energy that is lower than the effective hubbard gap .",
    "the subsequent transformation to the low - energy , spin - only model is known as the cell - perturbation method . the local basis of cuo@xmath1 and zno@xmath1 states of the multi - orbital hamiltonian provides a natural small parameter for such a projection , the effective hopping between the states of the nearest - neighbor clusters .",
    "we proceed with this transformation and give a quantitative analysis of the individual processes that contribute to the superexchange terms of the effective model .",
    "next , we analyze possible range of the frustrating interactions in the low - energy model of the zn - doped cuo@xmath0 plane",
    ". the discussed approach should be valid as long as the system is in the mott insulating state .      the three - band hubbard model , which was proposed to describe relevant electronic degrees of freedom of the cuo@xmath0 planes of the high-@xmath2 cuprates,@xcite is formulated in terms of the hole creation and annihilation operators acting on the vacuum state of the completely filled @xmath52 shells of cu and @xmath53 shells of o @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the energies of the hole in the copper @xmath57 and in the oxygen @xmath58 or @xmath59 orbitals , respectively .",
    "the copper(oxygen ) sites are labeled with the index @xmath60(@xmath61 ) , the number operators are @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) , and @xmath64 is the spin .",

    "the summation @xmath69 is over the nearest - neighbor cu - o bonds .",
    "the relevant transitions within the three - band model involve @xmath70-@xmath71 states on copper and @xmath42 states on oxygen sites . at half - filling ,",
    "there is one hole per cuo@xmath0 unit cell and the ground state is the antiferromagnetic insulator.@xcite the localized @xmath72 spins , forming the nel - ordered state on the square lattice , are provided by the holes that are predominantly in the @xmath73 states on cu and are hybridized with the @xmath74 states on o , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] .    the minimal form of the three - band model in ( [ h : three - band - cu ] )",
    "is often supplemented with additional terms , such as the direct oxygen - oxygen hopping , on - site coulomb interactions on o - sites , and the nearest - neighbor repulsion between o- and cu - holes .",
    "the main effect of such terms is in a quantitative renormalization of the energy levels and hopping integrals,@xcite leaving the results obtained with ( [ h : three - band - cu ] ) qualitatively the same",

    "the substitution of the isovalent zn@xmath16 ion with the nominally completely filled @xmath75-shell for cu@xmath16 leaves the oxygen lattice translationally invariant , see fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] .",
    "while the electronic levels of zn doped into a cuo@xmath0 plane have not been determined precisely,@xcite it is generally agreed that the relevant states may occur in a reasonable vicinity of the oxygen level , @xmath76ev , and we treat this energy as an adjustable parameter in the following .",
    "thus , the impurity hamiltonian can be written as @xmath77 where zn sites are labeled with @xmath78 , @xmath79 is the energy of the relevant orbital on zn , @xmath80 is an effective hubbard repulsion in that orbital , and @xmath81 is the hopping integral between nearest - neighbor zn and o sites , yet another adjustable parameter .",
    "the hole creation / annihilation operators on zn are @xmath82 and @xmath83 and @xmath84 .    the checkerboard structural motif of the cuo@xmath0 plane in fig .",
    "[ fig : cluster ] suggests a natural partitioning of the localized states into symmetric cuo@xmath1 and zno@xmath1 clusters , in which each cu or zn is surrounded by four oxygens.@xcite the advantage of such basic units is in constructing the local states that allow to take into account local hybridization of cu or zn and surrounding o states without approximation , while the remaining hybridization between the clusters can be treated perturbatively .",
    "in particular , such a cell - perturbation approach does not require cu - o and zn - o hopping integrals to be much smaller than the charge - transfer gap @xmath85.@xcite    on the other hand , the linear combinations of the oxygen states in cuo@xmath1 ( zno@xmath1 ) cluster are not orthogonal to the ones in the nearest - neighbor clusters .",
    "the elegant wannier - orthogonalization procedure , suggested in ref .  , treats the o - lattice separate from the cu and zn , and , via orthogonalizing @xmath42-operators in the @xmath86-space , leads to the basis of the symmetric - oxygen orbitals @xmath87 that are now associated with the same site index as the cu ( zn ) of the cuo@xmath1 ( zno@xmath1 ) cluster .",
    "the details of this procedure are given in appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "with that , it is natural to divide the cu - o ( zn - o ) hopping terms in ( [ h : three - band - cu ] ) and ( [ h : three - band - zn ] ) into the local part , which corresponds to hybridization within one cluster , and into the hopping part , corresponding to the coupling between the states in different clusters .",
    "we note , that due to the non - local nature of the wannier - orthogonalization , the hopping parts now contain terms that go beyond the nearest - neighbor clusters .",
    "thus , the hamiltonian of ( [ h : three - band - cu ] ) , written using the orthogonalized basis of o - states ( [ wannier ] ) is @xmath88 where @xmath89 are the wannier amplitudes given in ( [ eq : lambda_ll ] ) .",
    "first , the amplitudes @xmath90 decrease rapidly with distance,@xcite @xmath91 , so the terms beyond the nearest neighbor in the hopping part of ( [ h : symmetric_oxygen_cu ] ) can be neglected .",
    "second , the intra - cluster amplitude @xmath92 is close to 1 , and thus is taking most of the hybridization into account .",
    "the nearest - neighbor amplitude @xmath93 leads to the effective hopping parameter between different states that is significantly reduced compared to the bare @xmath66 hopping .",
    "this provides a strong justification for the subsequent perturbative expansion in such an effective hopping relative to the effective hubbard gap , the latter largely defined by the local hybridization .    applying the same transformation of the o - states ( [ wannier ] ) to the hamiltonian of the zn - cluster ( [ h : three - band - zn ] ) we obtain @xmath94",
    "note that even if zn - states are completely neglected in @xmath95 , zno@xmath1 cluster still has an unoccupied oxygen state@xcite with the energy @xmath56 , which is higher than the hybridized cuo@xmath1 states of the surrounding clusters , and it permits virtual superexchange processes through it .     and @xmath96 of one- and two - particle sectors in cu and zn clusters in eqs .

    "the next step in the cell - perturbation approach is the diagonalization of @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "such a diagonalization is performed separately for the states with different number of holes in a cluster . because the system is close to the half - filling , the most relevant states are the one- and two - hole states , and the states with more holes are higher in energy , see fig .",

    "altogether , all of the evidences indicate that the dilution - frustration model describes la@xmath0cu@xmath17zn@xmath18o@xmath1 better than the dilution - only model and that the effective frustrating interactions via available electronic states of the impurity should be taken into account when studying doped mott- and charge - transfer insulators .",
    "based on the analysis of the nel temperature doping dependence within the classical heisenberg model , an alternative suggestion has been put forward for additional interactions introduced by dopants , such as mg and zn : lattice distortions in the vicinity of the impurity site change the strength of @xmath8 bonds.@xcite the impact of this mechanism on @xmath21 and its possible viability as an alternative to our proposal has been investigated using the qmc analysis in ref .  .",
    "it was found that changing the strength of the eight cu - cu bonds in the immediate vicinity of zn site by as much as 15% ( @xmath252 ) changes the slope of @xmath157 by at most a few percent .",
    "such a weak effect rules out the lattice - distortion mechanism as a viable alternative to our theory .",
    "one of the natural consequences of our idea is that different isovalent impurities , such as zn@xmath16 and mg@xmath16 , should induce different amount of quantum fluctuations around them due to differences in their electronic levels available to generate frustrating interactions , and thus lead to a different rate of suppression of the order parameter .",
    "specifically , mg@xmath16 should have no levels in any reasonable proximity to the chemical potential , as opposed to zn@xmath16 , and thus should not lead to any substantial frustration , suggesting that the mg - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 must be described much better by a simple dilution - only model .",
    "this scenario has been investigated recently by the @xmath19sr experiments in zn- and mg - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 at low doping.@xcite the crucial finding of this work is that the spin stiffness , determined from the nel temperature , shows a stronger suppression rate in the case of zn - doping , in agreement with the expectations from our theory .",
    "although in additional to quantum contributions the slope of @xmath253 contains significant classical terms as well as logarithmic contributions from the three - dimensional interplane couplings,@xcite the difference in such slopes found in ref .",
    "is significant : @xmath254 vs @xmath255 .",
    "these values are consistent with the difference expected between the dilution - only model@xcite and the dilution - frustration model with the parameters discussed in sec .",
    "in this work , we have provided a detailed derivation of the low - energy , spin - only model of the zn - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 starting from the realistic site - diluted three - band hubbard model .",
    "we have followed with an equally detailed analysis of the order parameter in this low - energy model .",
    "we have elaborated on the proposal of our previous work that the impurities in strongly correlated systems may induce significant longer - range frustrating interactions among the spins , which are absent or negligible in the corresponding undoped system , due to hybridized electronic states of the impurity at the scale less than the hubbard-@xmath4 .",
    "such impurity - induced frustrating interactions are shown to significantly enhance local quantum fluctuations compared to the dilution - only model .",
    "in particular , the dilution - frustration model demonstrates stronger suppression of the order and , for a choice of parameters appropriate for zn - doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , it resolves discrepancies between experiments and earlier theories .",
    "recently , our theory has received further experimental confirmation from the @xmath19sr studies of spin stiffness in zn and mg doped la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 .",
    "although our work considers a particular case of diluted la@xmath0cuo@xmath1 , this study has far - reaching consequences for other diluted antiferromagnets and doped mott and charge - transfer insulators.@xcite one of the intriguing consequences of the proposed mechanism is the change of the character of the percolation transition due to frustrating interactions across the impurities .",
    "the impurity doping of one - dimensional spin systems such as spin chains and ladders should introduce weaker links between their parts instead of breaking them into independent pieces .",
    "experiments in diluted frustrated spin systems is yet another area , such as recently studied diluted @xmath181-@xmath32 system,@xcite which should also be affected by the same mechanism .",
    "another perspective is offered by an extension of the proposed mechanism of the impurity - induced frustrating interactions to the case of the doping away from half - filling where it may be responsible for the pair - breaking mechanism in the doped cuo@xmath0 planes .",
