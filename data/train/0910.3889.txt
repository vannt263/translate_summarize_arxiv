    "the use of @xmath0li isotope as a promising target for capturing solar neutrinos was first proposed by zatsepin and kuzmin @xcite and independently by bahcall @xcite .",
    "nuclei @xmath0li and @xmath0be are the mirror nuclei , and transitions between them are superallowed .",
    "therefore , the cross section of the reaction    @xmath1    is relatively large and can be calculated with high accuracy . due to the thermal broadening of the energy spectrum of @xmath0be neutrinos",
    ", the detector has a certain sensitivity to beryllium neutrinos , as was first shown by domogatsky @xcite and later was confirmed more accurately by bahcall @xcite .",
    "other factors that make the detector very attractive are the small atomic weight of the target and a high ( 92.5% ) abundance of @xmath0li in natural lithium . taken together , these factors provide a small mass of a lithium target with a relatively high sensitivity to solar neutrinos of medium energy range .",
    "ten tons of lithium suffice to construct a full - scale solar neutrino detector .",
    "some specific points concerning the implementation of the lithium project were considered elsewhere @xcite - @xcite .",
    "at present the statement can be made that a radiochemical lithium - beryllium method with a metallic lithium target to detect solar neutrinos has been developed in principal questions of its implementation for a full - scale experiment .",
    "the main advantage of the lithium detector is a high sensitivity to neutrinos generated in the carbon - nitrogen - oxygen ( cno ) cycle .",
    "the radiochemical technique was chosen because electronic detectors meet serious problems with the detection of these neutrinos : the fluxes are weak and energies are relatively low .",
    "the advantage of metallic lithium as a target is that some background - producing channels ( fragmentation of the target by the nuclear - active component of cosmic rays and background from the natural radioactivity ) are either absent or much weaker than those in case of lithium compounds @xcite . to implement the lithium project",
    ", it is of prime importance to develop ( i ) a technique for the extraction of beryllium from metallic lithium and ( ii ) a method to count the @xmath0be atoms extracted from lithium .",
    "the @xmath0be isotope is rather difficult to detect , because the kinetic energy of auger electrons released as a result of its decay is only 55 ev .",
    "this is  the main problem for the construction of a low - background counting system .",
    "however , this problem can be overcome if to use @xmath0be decays to the excited level of @xmath0li .",
    "the br ( branching ratio ) of this channel of decay is low ( only 10.3 % ) .",
    "however , it was shown by calculations @xcite that it suffices to achieve an accuracy of the measurement of the effect from solar neutrinos with the uncertainty approximately 10% what is , in fact , the aim of a lithium experiment . since a gamma quantum with the energy of 478 kev",
    "is emitted in this case , i.e. one has a rather convenient energy for counting by means of hpge detector , the design of an appropriate counting system on the basis of advanced technologies is quite feasible . using an assembly of high - purity germanium detectors with the 4@xmath2 geometry , the efficiency of @xmath0be detection of approximately 8% can be achieved with a sufficiently good background discrimination .",
    "this method of detection is also convenient because one can use a solid sample containing extracted @xmath0be atoms up to a few grams .",
    "it is important to prevent degradation of the counting efficiency due to the self - absorption of the 478-kev gamma line , this is the main limitation for the weight of the sample .",
    "the use of a solid sample considerably eases the requirements regarding the technology of lithium extraction from beryllium as will be explained later on .",
    "metallic lithium is used in a number of applications as a good heat - carrying agent .",
    "this point has been touched upon in many publications ( and in scientific and technical conferences ) . here , we concentrate on the following issues .",
    "the technology of closed liquid - metal lithium loops , which is employed today , is of little use for the lithium project , since the design of these loops is rather sophisticated .",
    "the lithium detector must work for a sufficiently long time ( 5 years ) .",
    "moreover , emergency cases should be practically excluded by two reasons : first  because lithium detector should be placed in a deep underground laboratory and second  to minimize the dead time of the detector .",
    "the design of the facility must be as simple and reliable as possible .",
    "the efficiency of beryllium extraction from lithium must be no less than 90% ; otherwise , the overall efficiency of the system will substantially decrease . and the most important point - after each procedure of beryllium extraction",
    ", the system must recover to its initial state ; i.e. , the characteristics of the detector must not be changed in time .",
    "it is also necessary to minimize lithium losses as a result of the extraction procedure .",
    "such are the main requirements to the detector under development .",
    "the technology was tried out on different laboratory benches . at the first stage , on the way to simplify the technology ,",
    "the important result was obtained : beryllium can be extracted from lithium at thermostatic conditions ; i.e. , there is no need to vary the temperature during the extraction procedure .",
    "this substantially simplifies the design of the facility and decreases the energy consumption .",
    "the next problem was to validate the chosen technology .",
    "for this a special setup was assembled shown in figure 1 .",
    "a stainless steel cylinder ( 2 ) is placed in a glove box ( 1 ) through which argon has been swept .",
    "high - purity ( 99.9% ) lithium of 3.2 l ( 1.6 kg in mass ) was placed into this cylinder in an argon atmosphere through the upper lid with a flanged joint .",
    "a stainless steel mesh placed at the bottom of the tank was used to remove films of the lithium oxide . through a pipe at the bottom of the cylinder the molten lithium was delivered to assembly ( 3 ) , which contained 50 mg of high - purity aluminum irradiated by a @xmath3 100-mev proton beam on the high - intensity proton accelerator ( institute for nuclear research of the russian academy of sciences , troitsk , moscow region ) . the irradiation produced a certain activity of @xmath0be and @xmath4na in the aluminum sample .",
    "this pair of isotopes turned out to be very convenient to study the extraction of beryllium from lithium .",
    "figure 2 shows the energy spectrum of the gamma radiation from the irradiated sample that was obtained using 100 cc hpge detector .",
    "one can see that activity of @xmath4na was much higher than that of @xmath0be .",
    "this fact might cause some problems in the subsequent measurements because the low energy tail of the sodium line 511 kev might mask the beryllium line 478 kev .",
    "therefore , the aluminum sample was purified from sodium by evaporating @xmath4na atoms heating the aluminum sample in a graphite crucible in a vacuum at @xmath5 till the intensities of these isotopes became comparable .",
    "figure 3 shows the gamma spectrum of the sample measured after the sodium evaporation .",
    "na , width=384 ]    it was very interesting to see whether or not beryllium deposits onto the aluminum oxide film during melting .",
    "if so , the distribution of the beryllium over the lithium volume could be not homogeneous after the aluminum is introduced , as a carrier , into the lithium melt . to check this ,",
    "the aluminum oxide film was etched off in hydrofluoric acid .",
    "measurements of the sample activity after the etching showed that the beryllium was not deposited on the oxide film .",
    "this means that this way of the beryllium insertion does provide homogeneous distribution of beryllium in lithium .",
    "the aluminum and sodium were also uniformly distributed over the lithium volume , since their solubility in lithium is high .",
    "then lithium containing @xmath0be and @xmath4na activity was delivered into a cylinder no .",
    "3 through filter no .",
    "1 with three tight - wound meshes and then into a cylinder no .",
    "4 through filter no .",
    "2 . during the extraction procedure ,",
    "all the components of the setup were kept at @xmath6 . then the system was cooled down to room temperature and was cut into parts and the activity of each part was measured using a gamma spectrometer .",
    "the measurement of the activity of each part has revealed the following :    1 .",
    "the @xmath4na isotope almost entirely entered into the lithium contained in a cylinder no .",
    "the losses of this isotope ( deposits on the walls and filters ) were less than 1% .",
    "no traces of @xmath0be were observed in the lithium contained in a cylinder no .",
    "4 ; that is , beryllium has been completely extracted from lithium .",
    "no traces of @xmath0be were observed on the walls of cylinder no .",
    "3 and on filters nos . 1 and 2 .",
    "less than 1% of the beryllium escaped the cylinder no.2 ( drain cylinder ) .",
    "almost all the activity of @xmath0be was deposited on the oxide films that were left on the walls of the drain cylinder .",
    "partly this has been achieved due to a very small diameter of the discharge pipe at the outlet of this cylinder .",
    "( would be the diameter of this tube larger , some portion of the oxide film with the corresponding activity of @xmath0be would inevitably flow away to a filter no.1 ) .",
    "the deposition of @xmath0be on the walls facilitates the subsequent extraction procedure ( it is much easier to collect @xmath0be from the surface than from the volume of the filter ) and also minimizes lithium losses in the extraction procedure .",
    "the atoms of @xmath0be contained in the oxide films on the walls of a drain cylinder were flushed away by subsequent showering the walls by measured portions of water and alcohol mixture .",
    "after flushing the walls of cylinder , each portion of water was passed through a paper filter . as a result ,",
    "part of the activity of @xmath0be was in an insoluble residue on the filter and part - in the solution downstream of the filter .",
    "a total of five flushing , 100 ml of water in each , were made .",
    "activity measurements taken after each flushing showed that the first four flushes wash away 96.4% of the initial activity of @xmath0be , 61.4% of which was in the precipitate and the remaining 35% in the soluble phase .",
    "an amount of 96.4% is quite an acceptable result for a lithium experiment .",
    "next , after burning filters and measuring the activity before and after burning , we found that the activity of @xmath0be was not lost in this procedure .",
    "this is because beryllium has no volatile compounds .",
    "thus , the efficiency of such a technique for beryllium concentration was demonstrated .",
    "the beryllium was extracted from the solution and converted to the solid phase using a technique developed earlier @xcite .",
    "losses of the activity of @xmath0be on the level more than 1% were not observed .",
    "the measurement of the lithium content in the solution showed that lithium losses in the process of beryllium extraction were less than 1% , what is quite satisfactory to conduct a full scale experiment .",
    "the results of this work can be summarized as follows .    1",
    ".   extraction of beryllium from lithium must proceed at thermostatic conditions .",
    "a modular structure ( 20 modules 500-kg lithium each ) of the detector is optimal .",
    "each module consists of two thermally insulated tanks shearing a common case , as shown in fig .",
    "the lithium is transferred back and forth from one tank of the module to the other . to facilitate the collection of beryllium atoms on the film of oxides on top of the molten volume",
    ", lithium gets mixed for a few hours at the end of exposure .",
    "after the lithium is transferred to another tank , the beryllium is collected from the precipitate on the walls of the tank by flushing the walls .",
    "the alkaline lithium solution is filtered to obtain an insoluble residue and a solution .",
    "beryllium is extracted from aqueous solution , purified and concentrated until a solid residue is obtained which can be used as a sample for the assembly of hpge detectors .    )",
    "lithium module : ( 1 ) liquid metal tubes and valves , ( 2 ) thermal insulation , and ( 3 ) electric heaters , width=288 ]    these are the major steps of the technological process which can be put at the basis for design and construction of a pilot lithium module .",
    "one of the background sources of lithium detector is the intrinsic radioactivity from uranium and thorium isotopes in lithium .",
    "the concentrations of uranium and thorium ( which were taken to be in equilibrium with daughters ) in lithium were measured using a low - background nai(tl ) detector surrounded by a 30-kg lithium layer .",
    "the measurements lasted 40 days with the lithium layer around the detector ; then the background was measured for 60 days when lithium sample was removed . upon the results of data treatment",
    "the upper limits were found of the abundance of @xmath7u - 4 x 10@xmath8",
    "g / g , and of @xmath9th - 2.2 x 10@xmath8 g / g . after the systematic uncertainties taken into account , an upper limit 10@xmath10 g / g both for @xmath7u and @xmath9th can be taken with high ( 90% ) confidence . at this level",
    "the calculated @xmath0be production rate from the impurities of @xmath7u and @xmath9th is less than 1% of the effect expected from solar neutrinos , which is quite satisfactory .",
    "the background was estimated using computational results reported in @xcite .",
    "the optimal conditions for extraction of beryllium atoms from metallic lithium are found , the coefficient of extraction 96% is obtained .",
    "the loss of lithium during the extraction procedure has shown to be less than 1% . prior to the construction of a full - scale 10-t lithium installation",
    ", it is planned to check all technological aspects on a pilot one - module setup where the reliability of the method can be demonstrated .    basically , the lithium experiment can provide important information on the thermonuclear reactions in the sun and together with the results of other solar neutrino experiments be used to further study the properties of neutrinos . at present , the development of the technique of lithium - beryllium experiment is quite timely , because the sensitivity of electronic detectors under development is still insufficient for reliable detection of neutrinos produced in the cno cycle .",
    "the results of this study have shown that principally it is possible to realize a full - scale experiment with 10 t of metallic lithium using a setup consisting of 20 lithium modules .",
    "this setup can be placed at a connection of two tunnels at a depth of about 4000 hg/@xmath11 and does not require excavation of a separate chamber , which simplifies the project and makes it much cheaper .",
    "further efforts must be focused on designing a 500-kg one - module pilot facility and a counting system based on an assembly of high - purity germanium detectors .",
    "the r&d work performed here on metallic lithium has also a certain value for the applied physics .",
    "the technology , conditions , and geometry for efficient extraction of beryllium from lithium have been found . this can be used , in particular , for creating intense neutron sources based on a lithium target ( the ifmif project @xcite is an example ) .",
