    "the process of quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite uses quantum mechanical properties of light fields to establish a secret shared key between two honest parties , named alice and bob .",
    "this key is then used to ensure secret communication between alice and bob by means of a classical cipher like the one - time - pad @xcite .",
    "the adversary of alice and bob is an eavesdropper eve , who tries to gain the maximum knowledge about the key without being noticed by alice and bob .",
    "eve can use any method within the laws of quantum mechanics , and therefore is not restricted by technological imperfections .",

    "alice and bob are able to detect any interference of eve with the quantum states .",
    "classical information is exchanged on the _ classical channel_. this channel has to be authenticated in order to prevent a man - in - the - middle attack by eve .",
    "after the quantum states have been exchanged over the quantum channel , they are measured by bob .",

    "alice and bob try to generate a key pair from their correlations @xmath0 and correct possible errors . from the disturbance of the correlations",
    "they deduce the amount of information eve might have on the key pair , and reduce eve s information by privacy amplification . for these tasks , only communication over the classical channel is needed , as all exchanged information is classical . if the qkd is successful , alice and bob will share a key and have an upper bound on the information eve might have about it .    it has been shown by curty et al .",
    "@xcite that there is a necessary precondition for the second stage to succeed : the correlations @xmath0 coming from the first stage have to be created from an effective entangled quantum state shared between alice and bob . only then it is possible to generate a secret key from the data set .",
    "note that this effective entanglement does not mean that entanglement as a physical resource has to be used in the state preparation step .",
    "it is sufficient that alice and bob can model their correlations as if they had shared an entangled state .",
    "we use an entanglement witness to check if the correlations show effective entanglement .    in this paper , we demonstrate this effective entanglement for a particular implementation of the quantum channel .",
    "we present a prepare&measure type setup , which uses the polarization of coherent light pulses to generate nonorthogonal quantum states .",
    "the pulses are characterized by a heterodyne measurement @xcite on bob s side , allowing for a reconstruction of their antinormal ordered quasi - distribution , or q - function @xcite .",
    "we show for this particular system that we can prove effective entanglement for the prepared quantum states using a model developed by rigas et al .",
    "thus , it has clearly the potential of generating secret keys .",
    "following this , we use a reasonable model to predict key rates for a classical key generation process with the data obtained in stage one of the experiment .",
    "it considers postselection @xcite with direct or reverse reconciliation @xcite of the measurement data .",
    "this qkd protocol is known to be secure against an adversary eve who is restricted to beam splitting attacks @xcite .",
    "the paper is divided into five subsections . in section",
    "ii we briefly introduce the theoretical background of the entanglement verification process , as it is described by rigas et al .",
    "we also present the qkd quantum state protocol there . in section iii",
    "we give a characterization of the experimental apparatus which implements the quantum stage of the qkd system .",
    "section iv shows how the q - function can be experimentally reconstructed and how the effective entanglement of the qkd setup can be verified .",
    "section v gives achievable key rates for our experiment applying a postselection procedure .",
    "the existing qkd systems fall into two categories : entanglement based systems and prepare&measure systems . for a review on both see e.g. @xcite . in entanglement",
    "based systems , a bipartite entangled state is produced by a source which might even be under eve s control .",
    "one part of the entangled state is then sent to alice while the other is sent to bob . here",
    "alice and bob can directly verify the entanglement of the state , thus bounding any interaction of eve @xcite .",

    "prepares a quantum state and sends it through the quantum channel to bob @xcite .",
    "he characterizes the quantum state , and from alice s preparation and bob s measurement results they estimate eve s action and information on the quantum state . as sources of entangled states are hard to implement and suffer from technical disadvantages , we use the latter approach in our experiment , which ensures stable , deterministic state preparation with minimum resources .    in our protocol",
    "alice encodes her bit values into two nonorthogonal states as in the b92 protocol @xcite . in particular",
    ", she prepares coherent states with the amplitudes @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "a general coherent state can be described in a fock state basis by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the photon number , and @xmath5 a photon number eigenstate .",
    "the coherent states constitute an overcomplete basis set , because there is always an overlap between two coherent states with amplitudes @xmath6 and @xmath7 , as given by @xmath8 thus it is impossible to discriminate between the coherent states @xmath9 and @xmath10 with certainty @xcite .",
    "the coherent states emitted by alice are transmitted through the quantum channel , which is under the control of the eavesdropper eve .",
    "she can manipulate the states and adjust the channel properties to get an advantageous position in the key generation process .",
    "as the states enter bob s measurement station , he performs a heterodyne measurement @xcite , in contrast to the original b92 setup , where a photon counter is used to discriminate between the different states .",
    "the heterodyne measurement splits the optical mode on a 50/50 beam splitter and measures the two conjugate field quadratures on its outputs with two homodyne detectors .",
    "this measurement of two conjugate observables ( see e.g. @xcite ) corresponds to a projection on coherent states .",
    "the quadrature operators are derived from the creation and annihilation operators @xmath11 and @xmath12 by : @xmath13 bob records the results of the heterodyne measurement in a two - dimensional histogram , which represents the q - function @xcite : @xmath14 here , the general state @xmath15 is projected onto the coherent state @xmath16 .    to model the prepare&measure setup with effective entangled states ,",
    "we follow bennett et .",

    ", alice effectively prepares a coherent state of amplitude @xmath1 or @xmath2 as signal .",
    "thus , conditioned on her qubit measurement result , alice produces a certain coherent state . as her measurement result ,",
    "0 or 1 , is occurring completely randomly , but also completely correlated with the generated coherent state , the entanglement source resembles the random production of coherent states with amplitudes @xmath1 or @xmath2 . in reality",
    ", such a random production of coherent states can be enabled without the use of an entanglement source , but in the theoretical description there is no difference between these two physical systems .",
    "the coherent states travel over the quantum channel , where eve can interact with them .",
    "also channel losses are attributed to eve , as she can always replace a lossy channel with a lossless one and tap off the surplus intensity .",
    "when eve has interacted , the pure coherent states might have changed to more general mixed states described by the density matrices @xmath20 and @xmath21 . from the results of the heterodyne measurement",
    ", bob can reconstruct the q - function , and deduce the quadrature variances @xmath22 and @xmath23 and all other elements of the covariance matrix .",

    "\\label{eqn_b - matrix}\\ ] ]    it has been shown @xcite , that an expectation value matrix with certain restrictions can only be justified by assuming that an entangled state is shared between alice and bob . this is done by using a separability criterion ( positive partial transposition type ) . to verify this , only the blocks on the diagonal of @xmath27 have to be computed",
    "these are given by the expectation values corresponding to matrix @xmath24 for the two conditional signal states and are therefore completely characterized by bob s quadrature measurements . by proving this effective entanglement from the experimental data @xcite , we can fulfill the first precondition to generate a secret key from bob s and alice s correlations . the separability condition can be evaluated by semi - definite programming @xcite , giving an upper bound on the tolerable noise @xmath28 below which the effective entanglement can be verified .",
    "this bound depends on the input state overlap @xmath29 and the quantum channel loss .",
    "we define the excess noise or excess variance @xmath30 of an observable @xmath31 for a signal state by comparing its variance to the variance of a coherent vacuum state ( shot noise ) as @xmath32 figure [ figure_ent_criterion_theory ] shows the numerically calculated bounds to the excess variance for different quantum channel transmissions .",
    "( in shot noise units : snu ) below the curves , the correlated data @xmath0 can not be explained by separable states .",

    "different curves belong to different quantum channel transmissions @xmath33 . ]",
    "all experimental excess variances which are below their corresponding bounds fulfill the non - separability condition and thus the scheme exhibits effective entanglement .",
    "the experimental setup deviates from the theoretical description in the previous section in one aspect . to determine the quadratures @xmath31 and @xmath34",
    ", bob has to use a phase reference as local oscillator for the homodyne measurements @xcite .",
    "this phase reference is sent along with the signal state in our experiment , as it is done in most continuous variable quantum cryptography experiments @xcite .",
    "the analysis of quantum correlations does not directly apply to this new situation .",
    "however , there is no obvious possibility for eve to manipulate the local oscillator in her favor , as it is a classical signal , and its phase can be publicly announced by alice and bob without giving away any information about the signal state .",
    "moreover , bob can use his own local oscillator and phase lock it to alice s local oscillator , as described in @xcite , so that all that eve can do to the local oscillator is to introduce phase jitter , which disturbs bob s measurements without giving eve any information on alice s quantum states . in that case",
    ", the previous analysis would apply again . from now on we assume that the local oscillator is not manipulated by eve in any way .",
    "consequently our experimental realization of the quantum channel has to transmit two light modes : the signal field mode @xmath35 contains the weak coherent pulses in which the quantum information is encoded .",
    "the local oscillator mode @xmath36 is needed in the heterodyne measurement of the signal mode as a phase reference . instead of using two",
    "spatially separated channels to transmit the two modes , we use two orthogonal polarization modes as representing the two fields in one spatial mode .",
    "this facilitates the generation of the signal states as well as providing high quality interference of the two modes at the heterodyne detector .",
    "the amplitude and relative phase of the two orthogonal polarization modes can be described by the stokes parameters @xcite or by the stokes operators @xcite in quantum theory . in our notation",
    "they read : @xmath37 the intensity in the local oscillator mode @xmath36 is always much larger than the intensity in the signal mode @xmath35 , thus we have @xmath38 .",
    "the relative phases and amplitudes of the polarization modes can be manipulated with birefringent optical elements and polarizing beam splitters .    a schematic drawing of our setup is shown in fig .  [ figure_setup ] .",
    "an external cavity laser diode emits continuous wave light at 810 nm and by a polarizing beam splitter acting as polarization filter a coherent bright state is created in the local oscillator mode @xmath36 whereas the signal mode @xmath35 is in the vacuum state .",
    "the light passes through an magneto optical modulator that utilizes the faraday effect to alter the polarization state @xcite .",
    "depending on the externally applied magnetic field , the modulator rotates a linearly polarized input field and shifts the phase of circular polarized fields .",
    "the light polarization can be varied continuously from @xmath39-polarized to @xmath40-polarized , which corresponds to equal optical power in the @xmath35 and the @xmath36 modes . in our case",
    ", we only induce a very tiny modulation , such that for the optical powers @xmath41 in the two modes @xmath42 is always satisfied .",
    "the modulation is applied in pulses of 5@xmath43s duration , either with parallel or antiparallel magnetic field orientation , such that either the state @xmath10 or the state @xmath9 is produced in the @xmath35 mode .",
    "the state overlap @xmath44 is in the range from 0.2 to 0.8 .",
    "when encoding the signal , the intensity in the local oscillator mode is reduced only by a negligible amount ( intensity variations are smaller than @xmath45 in our experiment ) .",
    "therefore , a local oscillator of constant power can be assumed .",
    "as the signal field is derived from the local oscillator field through modulation , the relative phase of both fields is constant , even though the laser phase might suffer from fluctuations .",
    "the beam is then directed to bob , traveling through eve s domain over a free space link of approximately 20 cm .",
    "various quantum channel transmissions can be simulated by using neutral density filters to equally attenuate both modes @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in bob s receiver ,",
    "the incoming beam undergoes a heterodyne measurement .",
    "it is split on a polarization independent 50/50 beam splitter , and both parts are directed to individual homodyne measurement setups , which record the @xmath40-polarization and @xmath46-polarization respectively .",
    "this is done by interfering the signal and the local oscillator modes on a beam - splitter and subsequently recording the intensity difference at the beamsplitter output ports @xcite .",
    "as long as the local oscillator mode is much brighter than the signal mode , the difference photocurrent @xmath47 corresponds to @xmath48 with @xmath49 being the local oscillator optical power and @xmath50 the signal optical power , and @xmath51 the relative phase between signal and local oscillator .",
    "the relative phase of signal and local oscillator in our setup is controlled by the appropriate choice and setting of half wave plates ( hwp , @xmath40 measurement ) and quarter wave plates ( qwp , @xmath46 measurement ) .",
    "the two modes interfere at polarizing beam splitters . as both the signal and the local oscillator are in the same spatial mode , a very high interference contrast can be achieved .",
    "we record a polarization contrast larger than @xmath52 , corresponding to an interference visibility larger than 99.9% .",
