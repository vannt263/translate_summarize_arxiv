    "the interaction of hadrons with nuclei is one of the important chapters in hadron and nuclear physics and much work has been devoted to it @xcite . in particular the behavior of vector mesons in nuclei has received much attention , stimulated by the ansatz of a universal scaling of the vector meson masses in nuclei suggested in @xcite and the study of qcd sum rules in nuclei @xcite , although earlier studies within the nambu - jona - lasinio model produced no dropping of the vector meson masses @xcite .",
    "more concretely , the properties of the @xmath0 meson have been thoroughly studied theoretically and different calculations have been carried out within varied models ranging from quark models , to phenomenological evaluations , or using effective lagrangians @xcite .",
    "the values obtained for the selfenergy of the @xmath0 in nuclei split nearly equally into attracion and repulsion and range from an attraction of the order of 100 - 200 mev @xcite to no changes in the mass @xcite to a net repulsion of the order of 50 mev @xcite .",
    "experimental work along these lines is also rich and recently the na60 collaboration @xcite has produced dilepton spectra of excellent mass resolution in heavy ion reactions , for the spectra of the @xmath5 , which points to a large broadening of the @xmath5 but no shift on the mass .    on the other hand , it has been argued in @xcite that reactions involving the interaction of elementary particles with nuclei can be equally good to show medium effects of particles , with the advantage of being easier to analyse . in this sense ,",
    "a variety of experiments have been done with @xmath6 collisions in nuclei at kek @xcite and photonuclear collisions at jefferson lab @xcite by looking at dilepton spectra .",
    "a different approach has been followed by the cbelsa / taps collaboration by looking at the @xmath7 coming from the @xmath0 decay . in this line",
    "a recent work @xcite claims evidence for a decrease of the @xmath0 mass in the medium of the order of 100 mev from the study of the modification of the mass spectra in @xmath0 photoproduction ( actually , the conclusions of this paper are tied to the way the background is subtracted and it will be shown in @xcite that with other justified choices of background there is no shift of the mass or it could even be positive ) .    with sufficient attraction , @xmath0 bound states could be produced , and could be even observable provided the @xmath0 width in the medium would not be too large . indeed , several works have investigated the possibility to have @xmath0 bound states in nuclei @xcite and speculations on this possibility are also exploited in @xcite .",
    "suggestions to measure such possible states with the ( d , he-3 ) recoilless reaction have also been made @xcite .    in the present work , and stimulated by the work of @xcite , we shall study the photon induced @xmath0 production in nuclei , looking both at the experimental set up of @xcite , as well as to other set ups which we consider more suited to see bound @xmath0 states with this reaction .",
    "we will make predictions for cross sections for the @xmath8 reaction in nuclei , leading to @xmath0 bound states , for several photon energies and proton angles .    at the same time we shall also present results for inclusive @xmath0 production , looking at the @xmath7 decay mode of the @xmath0 , as in @xcite , and",
    "will show that due to the presence of an unavoidable background of @xmath7 ( unrelated to the @xmath0 ) at @xmath7 energies smaller than the @xmath0 mass , and to the different a - mass dependence of the background and @xmath0 production , a peak develops around @xmath9 in nuclei , which we warn not to misidentify with a signal of a bound @xmath0 state in the nucleus .",
    "we shall also show the optimal condictions to observe signals of eventual @xmath0 bound states , as well as the minimal experimental resolution necessary to see the possible peaks .",
    "here we evaluate the formation rate of @xmath0 bound states in the nucleus by means of the ( @xmath10,p ) reaction .",
    "we use the green function method @xcite to calculate the cross sections for @xmath0-mesic states formation as described in refs .",
    "@xcite in detail .",
    "the theoretical model used here is exactly same as that used in these references .",
    "we show first the momentum transfer of the ( @xmath10,p ) reaction in fig .",
    "[ fig : mom_trans ] , as a function of the incident photon energy , at forward and finite angles of the emitted proton .",
    "the momentum transfer is the important kinematical variable which determines the experimental feasibility of the formation of meson - nuclear bound states .",
    "indeed , deeply bound pionic atoms were discovered experimentally at the recoilless kinematics @xcite . in the formation of @xmath0 states",
    "we find that the recoilless condition is satisfied at @xmath11 gev , as in ref .",
    "@xcite , for @xmath0 production at threshold and forward proton production . however , the recoilless condition is never satisfied for finite proton angles .",
    "since some experimental set ups can have problems in proton forward detection , it is interesting to determine the optimal conditions with these boundary conditions . for this purpose",
    "we look at the optimal photon energy for protons emitted with a finite angle . for an angle of @xmath12 degrees for the emitted proton , the angle measured in @xcite",
    ", the momentum transfer takes the minimum value at @xmath13 gev . in this section",
    ", we consider 1.2 and 2.0 gev as the incident photon energies and 0 and 10.5 degrees as the emitted proton angles in the laboratory frame .     in the ( @xmath10,p ) reaction .",
    "the solid , dashed and dotted lines show the momentum transfers at @xmath0 energy @xmath14 , @xmath15 mev and @xmath16 mev , respectively .",

    "this means that the imaginary part of the potential has a strength of about @xmath30 .",
    "as discussed above , uncertainties in the subtraction of background in the experiment of @xcite do not allow us to draw any conclusion on the shift of the mass @xcite .",

    "should we have not done this calculation and intepreted it in the way we have done , the observation of a peak at about 100 mev below the @xmath0 mass could easily tempt anyone to claim it as an indication of a bound @xmath0 state in the nucleus . by performing the present study we are paving the way for future investigations on the topic with the performance of the necessary simulation of conventional mechanisms which accompany the reactions used in the search for more exotic phenomena .",
    "we would like to insist on the issue of the background , because there can be many sources for it . in the cbelsa /",
    "taps experiment , where the @xmath38 is observed from the two @xmath10 decay , a background of @xmath103 could also come from the production of two @xmath38 , or @xmath104 , with no detection of a fourth @xmath10 coming from one @xmath38 or @xmath75 decay",
    ". such background could be eliminated , but there are unavoidable backgrounds like that coming from the @xmath105 reaction . having this in mind we can easily see that even if the background of the reaction after eliminating avoidable backgrounds is about one third of the one assumed in the present discussion , or even smaller , the two bump structure of fig .  [ figemnuclear ] would still show up .",
    "finally , we would like to make a final comment in the sense that the strength of the cross section bears some information in itself . in the calculations done for the capture of @xmath0 mesons in bound orbits",
    "the cross sections are presented in absolute numbers .",
    "should experiments find some peak structure in the @xmath0 bound region with a strength considerably larger than the one predicted in the present calculations , this would be an indication that the strength observed is coming from some sort of background , not from the formation of bound @xmath0 states .",
    "in the present work we have carried out some calculations which should be very helpful in the search for eventual bound @xmath0 states in nuclei . in the first part we evaluated the reaction cross sections for the @xmath106 reaction in nuclei leading to the production of bound or unbound @xmath0 states together with the excitation of nuclear bound states .",
    "the calculations were done using different optical potentials which covered a wide range of bindings and absorptive parts .",
    "we found that only for potentials where the real part was larger than twice the imaginary part there was some chance to see peaks in the @xmath0 energy spectrum corresponding to the formation of the @xmath0 bound states .",
    "clear peaks could be seen for a potential ( -156 , -29 ) mev ( at @xmath107 ) , while if we had an imaginary part of about -50 mev , as suggested by present experimental data on the a dependence of the @xmath0 production , even with 100 mev binding no signal could be seen in the calculated spectrum .",
    "we studied the reaction for different photon energies and different proton angles . since the optimal situation to see the peaks appears for recoilesss kinematics , the photon energy of 2 gev was the optimal one if one observes protons in the forward direction .",
    "however , if the experimental conditions make it impossible or difficult to measure forward protons and a proton angle around 10 degrees is the choice , then we showed that a photon energy of about 1.2 gev was more suited and led to better recoilles kinematics than with photons of 2 gev .",
    "we performed the calculations for this situation which should serve to compare with experimental measurements made in the future .",
    "another relevant finding of the present work was that , even if bound states exist and they lead to peaks in the @xmath106 reaction , an experimental resolution better than 20 mev in the @xmath0 energy is mandatory to make the peaks visible .",
    "finally we made another useful evaluation by calculating the inclusive @xmath106 reaction leading to @xmath2 events . to the elementary reaction @xmath108 with subsequent @xmath2 decay of the @xmath0 we added a certain background from reactions leading to @xmath2 with not connection to @xmath0 production .",
    "then we studied this reaction in nuclei , and because of the different behavior in the production of uncorrelated and @xmath0 correlated @xmath2 pairs , we showed that a peak appeared in nuclei in the region of @xmath2 energy around @xmath3  mev , which could easily be misidentified by a signal of a bound @xmath4 state in nuclei .    altogether , the information found here should be of much help in order to identify the ideal set ups for future experiments searching for @xmath0 bound states in nuclei and to properly interprete results of these experiments .",
