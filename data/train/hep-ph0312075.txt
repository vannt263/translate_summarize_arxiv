    "mesonic weak transition form factors and decay constants are two of the most important ingredients in the study of hadronic weak decays of mesons . there exist many different model calculations .",
    "the light - front quark model @xcite is the only relativistic quark model in which a consistent and fully relativistic treatment of quark spins and the center - of - mass motion can be carried out .",
    "this model is very suitable to study hadronic form factors .",
    "especially , as the recoil momentum increases ( corresponding to a decreasing @xmath8 ) , we have to start considering relativistic effects seriously . in particular , at the maximum recoil point @xmath9 where the final - state meson could be highly relativistic , there is no reason to expect that the non - relativistic quark model is still applicable .",
    "the relativistic quark model in the light - front approach has been employed to obtain decay constants and weak form factors  @xcite . there",
    "exist , however , some ambiguities and even some inconsistencies in extracting the physical quantities .",
    "well known examples are the vector decay constant @xmath10 , the form factor @xmath11 in the pseudoscalar to pseudoscalar transition @xcite and the electromagnetic form factor @xmath12 of the vector meson ( see e.g. @xcite ) . a covariant model has been constructed in @xcite for heavy mesons within the framework of heavy quark effective theory and the results are free from above mentioned ambiguities .    without appealing to the heavy quark limit , a covariant approach of the light - front model for the usual pseudoscalar and",
    "vector mesons has been put forward by jaus @xcite .",
    "the procedure of calculation can be separated into four steps : ( a ) the starting point of the covariant approach is to consider the corresponding covariant feynman amplitudes in meson transitions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn ] .",
    "( b ) one can pass to the light - front approach by using the light - front decomposition of the internal momentum in covariant feynman momentum loop integrals and integrating out the @xmath13 component  @xcite .",
    "( c ) at this stage one can then apply some widely - used vertex functions in the conventional light - front approach after @xmath14 integration .",
    "it is pointed out by jaus that in going from the manifestly covariant feynman integral to the light - front one , the latter is no longer covariant as it receives additional spurious contributions proportional to the lightlike vector @xmath15 .",
    "( d ) this spurious contribution is cancelled after correctly performing the integration , namely , by the inclusion of the zero mode contribution  @xcite , so that the result is guaranteed to be covariant .",
    "it should be noted that in @xcite a simple covariant power - law - like vertex function is used in step  ( a ) .",
    "once a covariant vertex function is used in step  ( a ) , the above procedure should give identical results to the direct integration of feynman integration via the usual technique .",
    "the power - law - like vertex function does not lead to a satisfactory phenomenological result when comparing to some widely used gaussian form vertex functions in step ( c ) .",
    "since the covariant counterpart of the gaussian like vertex function is not explicitly known , a use of it in step ( c ) may lead to some residue spurious contributions .",
    "these corrections to decay constants and form factors are worked out in  @xcite .",
    "we check that these corrections are small in the decay constant ( within 10% ) and form factors ( within 2% ) . in  @xcite , we have extended the covariant analysis of the light - front model in  @xcite to even - parity , @xmath1-wave mesons . since the residue spurious corrections have not been worked out in the @xmath1-wave meson case , we shall follow the procedure of  @xcite for the extension .    1.3 in    ( a)(b )",
    "0.2 cm    interest in even - parity charmed mesons has been revived by recent discoveries of two narrow resonances : the @xmath16 state @xmath17  @xcite and the @xmath18 state @xmath19  @xcite , and two broad resonances , @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the hadronic @xmath22 decays such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 have been recently observed , where @xmath3 denotes a @xmath1-wave charmed meson .",
    "a theoretical study of them requires the information of the @xmath2 form factors and the decay constants of @xmath3 and @xmath25 . in the meantime , three body decays of @xmath22 mesons have been recently studied at the @xmath22 factories : babar and belle .",
    "the dalitz plot analysis allows one to see the structure of exclusive quasi - two - body intermediate states in the three - body signals .",
    "the @xmath1-wave resonances observed in three - body decays begin to emerge .",
    "theoretically , the isgur - scora - grinstein - wise ( isgw ) quark model  @xcite is so far the only model in the literature that can provide a systematical estimate of the transition of a ground - state @xmath0-wave meson to a low - lying @xmath1-wave meson . however",
    ", this model and , in fact , many other models in @xmath26 ( @xmath27 : pseudoscalar meson , @xmath28 : vector meson ) calculations , are based on the non - relativistic constituent quark picture . as noted in passing , the final - state meson at the maximum recoil point @xmath9 or in heavy - to - light transitions could be highly relativistic .",
    "it is thus important to consider a relativistic approach .",
    "there are some theoretical constraints implied by heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) in the case of heavy - to - heavy transitions and heavy - to - vacuum decays  @xcite .",
    "it is important to check if the calculated form factors and decay constants do satisfy these constraints .",
    "furthermore , under hqs the number of the independent form factors is reduced and they are related to some universal isgur - wise ( iw ) functions .",
    "the relevant iw functions , namely , @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are obtained .",
    "one can then study some properties of these iw functions , including the slopes and sum rules  @xcite .",
    "the decay constants for @xmath32 mesons are defined by the matrix elements [ eq : am ] 0|a_|p(p^)&=&i f_p p^ _ , 0|v_|s(p^)= f_s p^ _ , + 0|v_|v(p^,)&= & m^_v f_v^ _ , + 0|a_|^3(1)a(p^,)&= & m^_^3a(^1a ) f_^3a(^1a)^ _ , where the @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 states of @xmath39 mesons are denoted by @xmath27 , @xmath40 , @xmath28 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively . note that a @xmath38 state can not be produced by a current .",
    "it is useful to note that in the su(n)-flavor limit ( @xmath44 ) we should have vanishing @xmath45 and @xmath46  @xcite .",
    "these can be easily seen from charge conjugation . under charge",
    "conjugation @xmath47 , while @xmath48 . for a charge conjugated state",
    ", we have @xmath49 .",
    "thus , we must have @xmath50 for these charge conjugated states . through su(n )",
    "symmetry the above constraint should apply to all other states in the same multiples .",
    "furthermore , in the heavy quark limit ( @xmath51 ) , the heavy quark spin @xmath52 decouples from the other degrees of freedom so that @xmath52 and the total angular momentum of the light antiquark @xmath53 are separately good quantum numbers .",
    "hence , it is more convenient to use the @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath18 and @xmath56 basis .",
    "it is obvious that the first and the last of these states are @xmath38 and @xmath34 , respectively , while @xcite [ eq : phalf ] |p^3/2_1=|^1p_1 + 1|^3p_1 , +    within each multiplet , @xmath57 , heavy quark symmetry ( hqs ) requires  @xcite @xmath58 where we have denoted the @xmath18 and @xmath55 states by @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "it is important to check if the calculated decay constants satisfy the non - trivial su(n)-flavor and hqs relations .",
    "we now follow  @xcite to evaluate meson decay constants and obtain f_p&=&dx_2 d^2p^_(m_1^x_2+m_2 x_1 ) , + f_s&=&dx_2 d^2p^_(m_1^x_2-m_2 x_1 ) , + f_v&=&dx_2 d^2p^ _ + & & , + f_^3a&=&-dx_2 d^2p^ _ + & & , + f_^1a&=&dx_2 d^2p^ _ ( p^2 _ ) , + [ eq : f ] where @xmath61 are meson masses , @xmath62 are quark masses , @xmath63 are vertex functions , @xmath64 are kinetic masses and @xmath65 are momentum fractions . since @xmath63 and @xmath64 are symmetric under the exchange of 1 and 2 in the @xmath66 limit .",
    "it is clear that @xmath50 for @xmath66 .",
    "the su(n)-flavor constraints on @xmath45 and @xmath46 are thus satisfied .",

    ".   for heavy - to - heavy transitions such as @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath3 , the sign of various form factors can be checked by heavy quark symmetry .",
    "our results are indeed in accordance with hqs .",
    "it is pointed out in @xcite that for @xmath70 transitions , the form factors @xmath71 exhibit a dipole behavior , while @xmath72 and @xmath73 show a monopole dependence .",
    "an inspection of table  [ tab : lfbtod ] indicates that form factors @xmath74 and @xmath75 have a monopole behavior , while @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 have a dipole dependence .",
    "our numerical result for @xmath79 is too sensitive to the @xmath67 parameter .",
    "the @xmath79 shown in table  iii are determined from @xmath80 and @xmath81 through hq relations instead .",
    "we see from the comparison of lf and isgw2 results in table  [ tab : lfbtod ] that the form factors at small @xmath8 obtained in the covariant light - front and isgw2 models differ not more than 40@xmath82 .",
    "relativistic effects are mild in @xmath68 transition , but they could be more prominent in heavy to light transitions , especially at maximum recoil ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "for example , we obtain @xmath83  @xcite , while isgw2 gives 1.01 .",
    "if @xmath84 behaves as the scalar partner of the @xmath85 meson , it is expected that @xmath86 .",
    "5 .   to determine the physical form factors for @xmath87 transitions",
    ", one needs to know the mixing angles of @xmath88 .",
    "a mixing angle @xmath89 is obtained by belle through a detailed @xmath90 analysis @xcite , while @xmath91 is determined from the quark potential model @xcite as the present upper limits on the widths of @xmath19 and @xmath92 do not provide any constraints on the @xmath93 mixing angle .",
    "we use a theoretical predicted @xmath94 in table  iv  @xcite .",
    "the decay rates for @xmath95 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 obtained in light - front and isgw2 models shown in table  iv agree with experimental results in most cases .",
    "( i )  note that our decay constants for @xmath1-wave mesons are used in both lf and isgw2 cases .",
    "( ii )  usually we expect a factor two to three enhancement in @xmath5 rates from @xmath96 rates .",
    "the old upper limit in @xmath97 needs further check .",
    "( iii )  the color - allowed cabbibo favored @xmath98 amplitudes involve @xmath99 form factors and @xmath25 decay constants .",
    "since the form factors are standard , this type of decays provides valuable information on @xmath25 decay constants .",
    "the agreement between theory and experiment supports our predictions on @xmath25 decay constants .",
    "in @xcite isgur - wise functions are obtained through either top down  @xcite or bottom up ( take @xmath100 ) approaches .",
