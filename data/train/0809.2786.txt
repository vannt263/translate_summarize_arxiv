    "in a @xmath18 universe , the first luminous objetcs were formed due to fall - in of gas inside the dark matter potential wells ( for a review see @xcite ) . in order to let the fall - in of gas inside the dark matter potential wells ,",
    "the gas thermal energy should have been radiated away by some physical mechanism .",
    "since the primordial molecular clouds would have zero metallicity , the collisional excitation of the existing molecules is the most plausible mechanism for the cooling of baryonic matter in this environment because the collisional excitation cooling of both @xmath19 and @xmath20 atoms are inefficient at temperatures lower than @xmath21 , which is higher than the temperature of star formation clouds .",
    "@xcite showed that the first lumious objects may have formed at @xmath22 inside a @xmath23 halo ( @xmath24 ) , which have recently been confirmed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that the stars formed in this environment could be as massives as @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "after the recombination era , the most abundant molecule in the universe is molecular hydrogen @xmath0 . despite of its low primordial abundance , @xmath26 @xcite , this molecule has a fundamental role in the gas cooling at temperatures less than @xmath21 .",
    "the first authors to highlight the role of @xmath0 in this context were @xcite and @xcite .",
    "saslaw & zipoy ( 1967 ) showed the importance of the charge transfer reaction between @xmath27 and @xmath19 to form @xmath0 , and peebles & dicke ( 1968 ) suggested a mechanism to form @xmath0 from @xmath28 .",
    "the @xmath0 molecule forms by the @xmath28 and @xmath27 channels mainly .",
    "the reactions    @xmath29    are followed by @xmath30    due to its zero dipolar moment only quadrupolar rotational transitions are allowed , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the quantum number for angular momentum ; @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to its small moment of inertia ( the smallest one between all molecules ) the energy gap between its rotational quantum states , @xmath33 , is large compared with other molecules ( @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the moment of inertia ) .",
    "the smallest energy gap is @xmath36 . with this energy difference",
    "it is very diffucult to reach temperatures below @xmath6 , ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the @xmath1 molecule forms through @xmath13 and @xmath37 channel mainly ( see @xcite ; @xcite ) @xmath38 @xmath1 has a moment of inertia greater than the @xmath0 one .",
    "furthermore , it has a finite dipolar moment which allows internal dipolar trasitions ( transitions of the kind @xmath39 ) and internal transition rates greater than in @xmath0 , @xcite . due to its small moment of inertia , the differences between its energy states are smaller than the energy differences of the @xmath0 molecule .",
    "all these properties make the @xmath1 molecule an efficient cooler at low temperatures , below @xmath6 , ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "+ the @xmath2 molecule is formed mainly by radiative association of @xmath40 and @xmath19 and associative detachment of @xmath41 and @xmath19 @xcite : @xmath42 moreover , this molecule have both a dipolar moment and a moment of inertia larger than the ones of the @xmath1 molecule . these characteristics could make the @xmath2 molecule an efficient cooler at low temperatures , but the cooling functions depend on the number density of the specie , so if the abundance of @xmath2 is too low as expected in primordial environments @xcite its cooling effect will be negligible . for a review of @xmath40 chemestry see @xcite and @xcite .    in the work of @xcite",
    "the effect of @xmath1 and @xmath2 was included on the gas cooling . to calculate the photo - destruction ratescoefficient , for photoionization , photodetachment , and photodissociation , they assumed detailed balance with cmb photons .",
    "but , to study the effect of the first stars on the primordial gas we need the cross section for each photo - destruction process , in the spirit of @xcite .",
    "these cross sections are described below .",
    "our current work includes the photo - destruction cross sections of both @xmath40 and @xmath41 and the photodisociation of @xmath2 ( in its rovibrational ground state ) in contrast to previous work .",
    "we improve over recent works @xcite that have studied primordial cooling by exploring the effect of the @xmath1 abundance and the inclusion of a stellar radiation field .",
    "this paper is organized as follow . in ",
    "2 we describe both the thermal and chemical model required to follow the evolution of the gas temperature . in ",
    "3 we present results and discussion .",
    "it includes the gas temperature evolution as a function of gas density and molecular coolers ; the gas temperature evolution as a function of @xmath1 abundance ; the temperature evolution as a function of the ionization degree and finaly we show the effect of a star radiation field on the gas temperature . in ",
    "4 we present the conclusions .",
    "as argued above , in a realistic cooling model of primordial gas , it is mandatory to include the molecular coolers .",
    "the main molecular coolers at low temperatures are @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in adition to the previous molecules , the model should include the main species created in the primordial nuclesynthesis .",
    "our model includes 21 species : @xmath19 , @xmath12 , @xmath28 , @xmath0 , @xmath27 , @xmath43 , @xmath20 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath37 , @xmath13 , @xmath1 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath40 , @xmath49 , @xmath41 , @xmath2 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the reactions considered for these species are described in table [ tbl-4 ] , [ tbl-4bis ] and [ tbl-5 ] .",
    "this table does not include the formation of @xmath0 by three body reaction because this reaction is not relevant at densities studied in this work .",
    "+ the cooling processes ( see table [ tbl-5 ] ) considered in this work are :    * collisional ionization : the gas loses energy by ionization of the different species in the environment . *",
    "recombination : the gas loses energy by free electrons capture . * collisional excitation : the gas loses energy when collisional excited electrons move to the unexcited states .",
    "* bremsstrahlung : loss of energy due to the radiation emited by accelerated electrons . *",
    "compton cooling : interchange of energy between free electrons and cmb radiation .",
    "the molecular cooling functions are constructed as in @xcite . for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecules we adopted the approximate density dependent relation for the cooling functions .",

    "this process is quantified by the frequency dependent cross section , @xmath53 , of the reaction @xmath54 , where the specie @xmath55 in the @xmath56 ionization state moves to @xmath57 ionization state due to the interaction with photons .",
    "the presence of a radiation field triggers a photo - destruction rate : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the number density of specie @xmath60 ; @xmath61 is the specific intensity of radiation in the environment and @xmath62 is planck s constant .",

    "we assume @xmath69 .",
    "for example , @xmath19 photoionization cross section is @xmath70 , @xmath71 is greater than 1 for @xmath72 if we take @xmath73 in the range @xmath74 .",
    "this distance is well below the halo scale distance .",
    "+ the cross sections , the ionization rates and the heatings included in this work are mentioned in table [ tbl-6 ] + with each one of these functions we can calculate both the abundance of all species and the temperature evolution .",
    "the abundance of specie @xmath60 in the gas evolves following the equation @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the creation rate of specie @xmath60 by @xmath56 and @xmath77 with @xmath78 the rate coefficient of the reaction and @xmath79 is the destruction rate of specie @xmath60 by specie @xmath80 , @xmath81 or by photoionization @xmath82 .",

    "this figure shows that is very difficult for an element of gas to drop its temperature if there is an ob star at a distance less than @xmath145 due to photo - destruction of its cooling molecular agents , @xcite . in other words",
    "if inside a halo of @xmath146 a star is born , it is very difficult for its surounded gas reach the necesary conditions to form other stars ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . the formation of more than one star could be possible if the seed clumps of gas evolve at the same time , without radiation feedback between them .",
    "the case in which the star is at @xmath147 and the gas has @xmath123 present the same evolution of an isolated element of gas .",
    "in this work we have developed a model for the temperature evolution of a primordial gas including 21 different chemical species including reaction rates and cross sections available in the literature .",
    "we have paid careful attention to explore the space parameter in abundance , specially @xmath1 , and to include the @xmath2 to study in detail at what abundances the molecular coolants are relevant .",
    "the main results are the following :    1 .   the @xmath1 molecule dominates the gas cooling at temperatures below @xmath148 in the range of densities @xmath149 for @xmath1 abudances over @xmath10 .",
    "the @xmath1 effect is more evident at higher densities .",
    "2 .   the @xmath2 molecule does not have a clear effect on the gas cooling .",
    "the gas would need an abundance at least ten orders of magnitude higher to be an efficient cooler , so @xmath2 is ruled out as an important cooler in primordial gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "3 .   a gas with high ionization degree can drop its temperature more than a neutral gas because both the ionized @xmath19 and @xmath37 and electrons are catalizers in the formation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cooling molcules .",
    "these ionization conditions could be presents in post - shock waves zones or relic @xmath150 regions , @xcite .",
    "4 .   is very difficult for a gas to drop its temperature in the presence of an ob star located closer than @xmath17 .",
    "so , in order to form more than one star in a primordial halo the formation of seed clumps should almost be instantaneous , otherwise the radiation feedbak of first stars will suppress the star formation conditions ( @xcite ) .",
    "this work , as previos ones , suggests the importance of studing the effect firts stars would have on their sorrounding gas in the formation of more than one star within primordial halos ( see e.g. @xcite ) . for a more accurate study , we need to follow the star formation in a hydrodinamical model , which will we present in forthcoming papers .",
