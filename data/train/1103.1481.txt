    "current correlators are building blocks for a number of physical quantities . among them",
    "is the total cross section of hadrons in electron positron annihilation which is obtained from the imaginary part of the vector correlator .",
    "the axial - vector correlator leads in an analogue way to contributions to the @xmath0 boson decay rate .",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar correlators govern the decay rate of higgs bosons with the respective cp property .",
    "an important role in the context of current correlators is taken over by moments obtained from an expansion of the two - point functions for small external momenta . as far as the correlators are concerned where the current couples to the same quark flavour they have been used to extract precise values for the charm and bottom quark masses by comparing the results for the vector correlator up to four - loop order  @xcite with the moments obtained from the experimentally measured cross section ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "also the moments for the other correlators  @xcite can be employed once the experimental data is replaced by precise lattice simulations as has been done in refs .",
    "besides the mass values also the strong coupling constant can be extracted from the comparison of moments of the pseudo - scalar currents obtained both in perturbation theory and with the help of lattice gauge theory calculations  @xcite .",
    "the focus of the paper lies on moments of heavy - light current correlators , i.e. , two - point functions involving two quark flavours with different masses . results for the case where one of the masses is zero have been obtained in refs .",
    "@xcite and  @xcite to two- and three - loop order , respectively .",
    "these results have been used in  @xcite to reconstruct , in combination with high - energy expansions and information about the threshold behaviour , approximations valid for all external momenta and quark masses . applications of these results are corrections for single - top production or decay rates of charged higgs bosons in extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "the three - loop corrections have furthermore been used to obtain precise results for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson decay constants , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , based on sum rules  @xcite .",
    "also the extraction of @xmath3 and @xmath4 from lattice gauge simulations requires perturbative input . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite it is particularly desirable to have moments of the heavy - light currents for general values of the two quark masses , not only for the physical masses of the involved quarks in order to perform simulations for a variety of different masses , which then can be extrapolated to the mass values of physical interest .",
    "we therefore extend the known three - loop results for the moments of the vector , axial - vector , scalar and pseudo - scalar current correlators where one of the quark masses is zero to the case of two different masses .",
    "this is done by computing analytic expansions around two limiting cases , the one for equal masses , the other for one of the masses equal to zero .",
    "subsequently , approximations are constructed which cover the whole range .    in the next section we provide details on the calculation ,",
    "the results for the pseudo - scalar correlator are presented in section  [ sec::results ] .",
    "we conclude with a summary in section  [ sec::sum ] .",
    "long analytic formulae are relegated to the appendix where also numerical results for the vector , axial - vector and scalar correlator can be found .",
    "all results for the moments can be downloaded from  @xcite .",
    "let us in a first step present our notation .",
    "we define the vector ( v ) , axial - vector ( a ) , scalar ( s ) and pseudo - scalar ( p ) currents via @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the two quark flavours . using these currents the vector and axial - vector correlator",
    "is defined through ( @xmath8 ) @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the transverse and longitudinal contributions , respectively .",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar polarization function reads ( @xmath12 ) @xmath13 throughout this paper we consider anti - commuting @xmath14 which is justified as for @xmath15 only non - singlet diagrams contribute . as a consequence the axial - vector ( pseudo - scalar ) correlator coincides with the vector ( scalar ) one if either @xmath16 or @xmath17 is zero .",
    "sample feynman diagrams occurring at one- , two- and three - loop order are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig::diags ] .",
    "= .8    it is convenient to introduce the dimensionless variables @xmath18 which enables us to cast @xmath10 for @xmath19 in the form @xmath20 where the bar indicates that the overall renormalization of the polarization function is performed in the @xmath21 scheme .",
    "note that we have the symmetry relations @xmath22 and @xmath23 ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "we perform an explicit calculation only for the transverse part of the vector and axial - vector current and reconstruct the coefficients for the longitudinal part with the help of ( @xmath24 ) @xmath25 for @xmath26 and @xmath27 and six expansion terms in @xmath28 and @xmath29 we have checked that these equations hold .",
    "the expansion of the coefficients in @xmath30 is given by @xmath31 where the arguments @xmath28 and @xmath32 are suppressed .",
    "often it is advantageous to require a qed - like normalization @xmath33 where the relation to @xmath34 is given by @xmath35    for the practical calculation we use a well tested set - up which is highly automated in order to avoid errors .",
    "all feynman diagrams are generated with qgraf  @xcite and the various diagram topologies are identified and transformed to form  @xcite with the help of q2e and exp  @xcite .",
    "exp also applies the asymptotic expansion for @xmath36 on a diagrammatic level .",
    "the expansion around @xmath37 leads to a naive taylor series . in a next step",
    "the expressions are passed to form where appropriate projectors are applied , the expansions in small quantities are performed and traces are taken . once the analytical expressions for each diagram are reduced to scalar integrals the program matad  @xcite is called in order to handle vacuum integrals up to three loops .",
    "the three - loop calculation requires the inclusion of counterterms up to two - loop order ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) which we implement in the @xmath21 scheme both for the parameters @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath30 and the renormalization of the current itself .",
    "the latter is equal to the mass renormalization for the scalar and pseudo - scalar case and unity for the vector and axial - vector current . at that point",
    "all remaining poles are local and can be subtracted in the @xmath21 scheme in order to arrive at @xmath34 .",
    "( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details . )    following this procedure we were able to evaluate the coefficients @xmath38 with @xmath39 where terms up to order @xmath40 and @xmath41 are included in the expansions around @xmath42 and @xmath37 , respectively .",
    "in this section we discuss the quality of our expansions in @xmath28 . at one and two loops we can compare to the exact result which provides confidence concerning the validity of the three - loop approximations . in the main text",
    "we restrict ourselves to the pseudo - scalar case .",
    "results for the remaining three correlators are presented in the appendix and in ref .",
    "@xcite .                    where @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "these results have been extracted from ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath46 is given in analytic form up to two loops .",
    "we have checked the results of eq .",
    "( [ eq::cn0p ] ) evaluating directly the moments both exactly in @xmath28 and restricting ourselves to expansions in @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "note that the latter method has to be applied at three loops .    in fig .",
    "[ fig::c3pas0 ] we discuss @xmath49 for @xmath50 and @xmath51 and show the curves including @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath40 for the small-@xmath28 expansion as dashed lines where longer dashes correspond to approximations including higher order power corrections .",
    "the dotted lines correspond to expansions around the equal - mass case where curves including @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath41 ( decreasing distance between dots ) are shown .",
    "the exact result is shown as solid curve .",
    "one observes that the approximation including corrections up to order @xmath40 coincides with the exact result up to @xmath56 , for @xmath57 even up to @xmath58 . on the other hand ,",
    "the approximation based on the @xmath59 terms is indistinguishable from the solid line for @xmath60 .",
    "these limits are close to the ones obtained by considering the approximations including @xmath53 and @xmath55 terms only .",
    "it is obvious that the small gap in between can easily be closed with the help of a polynomial interpolation .",
