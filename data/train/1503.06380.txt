    "most theoretical work so far has employed numerical monte carlo simulations  @xcite , incorporating the range of confinement , the aspect ratio and the density of the constituent rods .",
    "this approach inherently depends on the details of the microscopic parameters .",
    "although very useful in modeling specific small systems these simulations do not provide a universal or complete picture of the phase diagram and corresponding transitions exhibited by confined systems .",
    "the aim of this paper is to gain a basic understanding of the symmetry selection mechanisms of nematic configurations confined to circular geometries .",
    "as suggested by experimental data  @xcite , the delicate interplay between boundary and bulk effects is responsible for the variety of equilibrium structures . confined to thin annuli ,",
    "@xmath0-viruses readily satisfy the preferred tangential alignment at the inner and outer boundaries ( planar anchoring ) at the expense of bend elastic distortions in the bulk . for a disc ,",
    "such a bend configuration would inevitably lead to the presence of a topological defect of charge @xmath3 at the center , in agreement with the poincar ",
    "hopf theorem  @xcite applied to line fields , since the euler characteristic @xmath4 of a disc is one .",
    "however , as analytically calculated below , the bulk defect is unstable with respect to two defects sitting at the boundary . as a result",
    "the nematic director satisfies the boundary conditions almost everywhere on the boundary ( strong anchoring ) except at a finite number of points , similar to the studies of langmuir monolayers  @xcite . in case of a finite / weak anchoring",
    ", the preferred alignment at the boundary can be violated over extended region . here",
    "we show that even for an annulus boundary defects become energetically favored , though no defects are required by topology ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "by inserting pairs of positive ( negative ) charges at the outer ( inner ) boundary of an annulus we screen the curvature of circumference and ` unbend ' otherwise bend nematic texture , similar to the stabilizing effect of the gaussian curvature in the two - dimensional manifold  @xcite . alternatively , introducing boundary defects into the uniform state ( no bend or splay elastic deformations ) , we can curve the director field to satisfy the boundary conditions and lower the anchoring energy . therefore ,",
    "whenever bulk and boundary energy contributions become equally important , we expect the equilibrium 2d textures to encompass boundary defects .",
    "interestingly , the phenomenon of the transformation between surface and bulk defects was studied in 3d nematic droplets  @xcite . when the boundary conditions , set by the temperature , change from the homeotropic to planar anchoring , the nematic director deforms from the ` hedgehog ' configuration ( point defect inside ) to the pair of ` boojums ' , sitting at the surface . in experiments with the @xmath0-virus  @xcite ,",
    "the nature of the boundaries does not change , while it is the size and the topology ( disc or annulus ) of the 2d confinement which may influence the distribution of the topological charge at the boundary . to quantify the effect of the confinement and weak anchoring conditions , we adopt the continuum theory of nematic liquid crystals  @xcite , assuming the one elastic constant approximation , such that bend and splay elastic constants are equal @xmath6 as suggested by  @xcite for @xmath0-virus .",
    "we quantify the relative stability and the equilibrium number and charge of defects at the boundary , which is governed by the ratio of the anchoring extrapolation length @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the anchoring strength ) and the system size @xmath9 . with no fitting parameters we capture some features of experiments  @xcite on @xmath0-viruses , namely the appearance of one- and two - fold textures , in particular .",

    "we exclude the configurations @xmath127@xmath125 from our analysis , because their elastic / total energy is much larger than that of @xmath122@xmath123 , as well as of the defect free states .    in fig .",

    ". the configuration @xmath136 may also be energetically accessible in a narrow range of parameters , consistent with the fact that it is rarely observed in experiments  @xcite . in all cases",
    "boundary - stabilized defect textures are the ground states of confined nematics when @xmath150 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : aphase]c , assuming weak anchoring @xmath132 m and @xmath96 m , we illustrate with different colors the minimizers of the total free energy @xmath56 .",
    "defect structures with @xmath71 are energetically favored , and therefore support our previous estimate of the anchoring extrapolation length .",
    "note that ground states ( energy minimizers ) with crystalline order on the surface of an embedded torus are also characterized by the presence of positive disclinations on the exterior of the torus and negative disclinations in the interior  @xcite .",
    "we have shown that , in contrast to what speculated in earlier works  @xcite , a number of defective textures observed experimentally in nematic films confined to circular and annular geometries can be accounted for within continuum liquid crystal theory . by examining the energetics of textures with localized defects at the boundary , and exploiting conservation of topological charge , our work captures the main features of experiments in @xmath0-virus  @xcite and provides an estimate for the anchoring extrapolation length in these systems ",
    "several challenging questions remain unanswered .",
    "our results suggest that the selection of the symmetry of observed nematic textures is controlled a single dimensionless parameter , @xmath151 , and the conservation of topological charge rather than by details of microscopic interactions .",
    "but what is the range of validity of the continuum theory , i.e. , is it valid when the size of confinement approaches a few molecular sizes ?",
    "another important question concerns the use of the one - elastic constant approximation , which is reasonable for semiflexible polymers , including the @xmath0-virus with its persistence length of the order of the polymer length  @xcite , but is not accurate for rigid rods  @xcite .",
    "a significant elastic anisotropy was measured experimentally for systems composed of tobacco mosaic virus  @xcite with bend constant larger than splay constant , @xmath152 . on the contrary , according to theoretical predictions  @xcite the splay elastic constant @xmath153 diverges as the length of the molecule while the bend elastic constant @xmath154 depends on the rigidity of the molecules .",
    "thus for ( semi)flexible polymers one expects @xmath155 . it would therefore be of interest to quantify the energetics of topological defects in case of strong anisotropy of the elastic constants .",
    "the authors  @xcite analyzed the influence of splay - bend anisotropy on the formation of fiber texture in discotic liquid crystals with fixed boundary conditions and topological defects in the bulk .",
    "our approach could also be generalized to other planar geometries with non - monotonic curvature of the boundary , such as the square plates examined in  @xcite .",
    "finally it is well known that in three dimensions topological defects affect the shape of nematic droplets  @xcite .",
    "it would similarly be interesting to examine the interplay between defect textures and shape in thin nematic films confined by a deformable boundary .",
