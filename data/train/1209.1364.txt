    "convection - diffusion equations oftentimes arise in mathematical models for fluid dynamics , environmental modeling , petroleum reservoir simulation , and other applications . among them ,",
    "the most challenging case for numerical simulation is the convection - dominated problems ( when diffusion effect is very small compared with the convection effect )  @xcite .",
    "dominated convection phenomena could appear in many real world problems ; for example , convective heat transport with large pclet numbers  @xcite , simulation of oil extraction from underground reservoirs  @xcite , reactive solute transport in porous media  @xcite , etc .",
    "the solutions of these problems usually have sharp moving fronts and complex structures ; their nearly hyperbolic nature presents serious mathematical and numerical difficulties .",
    "classical numerical methods , developed for diffusion - dominated problems , suffer from spurious oscillations for convection - dominated problems .",
    "many innovative ideas , like upwinding , method of characteristics , and local discontinuous galerkin methods , have been introduced to handle these numerical difficulties efficiently ; see , for example , @xcite and references therein .    for problems with nearly hyperbolic nature ,",
    "it is nature to explore the idea of the so - called method of characteristics  @xcite ; and , this idea has been combined with different spatial discretizations like finite difference ( fd ) , finite element ( fe ) , and finite volume ( fv ) methods . along this line of research ,",
    "the semi - lagrangian method ( or , in the finite element context , the eulerian  lagrangian method ) treats the convection and capacity terms together to carry out the temporal discretization in the lagrangian coordinate .",
    "the eulerian  lagrangian method ( elm ) gives rise to symmetric discrete linear systems , stabilizes the numerical approximation , and the corresponding diffusion problems are solved on a fixed mesh  @xcite .",
    "this method and its variants have been successfully applied not only on the linear convection - diffusion problem  @xcite , but also the incompressible naiver - stokes equations and viscoelastic flow problems ; see , for example , @xcite .    adaptive mesh refinement ( amr ) for partial differential equations ( pdes )",
    "has been the object of intense study for more than three decades .",
    "amr techniques have been proved to be successful to deal with multiscale phenomena and to reduce the computation work without losing accuracy when solution is not smooth . in general , the adaptive algorithm for static problems generates graded meshes and iterations in the following form : @xmath0 in the estimate procedure , we usually employ some computable local indicators to estimate the local error of the approximate solution we obtain from the solve procedure .",
    "these indicators only depend on the datum and/or the approximate solution , and show in which part(s ) of the domain the local error is relatively too big or too small in the current mesh .",
    "we then mark these subdomains and refine or coarsen them accordingly .",
    "local error indicators determine whether the whole adaptive procedure is effective or not .",
    "therefore , a reliable and efficient error indicator is the key to a successful amr method and a posteriori error analysis is often used to obtain such an error indicator in practice  @xcite . in the context of finite element methods , the theory of a posteriori error analysis and adaptive algorithms for linear elliptic problem is now rather mature . convergence and optimality of adaptive methods for linear elliptic problems",
    "have been proved as the outcome of a sequence of work  @xcite ; see the recent review by nochetto , siebert , and veeser  @xcite and references therein . on the other hand , for the nonlinear and time - dependent problems ,",
    "the theory is still far from satisfactory .",
    "a posteriori error analysis for nonlinear evolution problems is even more challenging .",
    "adaptivity time - stepping is very important for time dependent problems because the practical problems sometimes have singularities or are multiscale in time .",
    "uniform time step size can not capture these phenomena .",
    "there are considerable amount of work in the literature devoted to the development of efficient adaptive algorithms for evolution problems .",
    "a posteriori error estimators for linear parabolic problems are studied in  @xcite and are also derived for nonlinear problems ; see  @xcite for example .",
    "there have been also some efforts for extending a posteriori error analysis for the time - dependent stokes as well as the navier - stokes equations  @xcite . in particular ,",
    "a posteriori error estimates for convection - diffusion problems have been discussed in  @xcite .",
    "it is nature to employ arm techniques for convection - dominated problems because of the complex structures of the solutions and evolution of these structures in time .",
    "we also notice that spatial mesh adaptivity plays an important role in elm to reduce numerical oscillations and smearing effect when inexact numerical integrations are employed  @xcite .",
    "early adoption of adaptive characteristic methods has been seen since late 1980 s  @xcite .",
    "a posteriori error estimates for characteristic - galerkin method for convection - dominated problems have been proposed : demokowicz and oden  @xcite considered the method of characteristics combined with petrov - galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization .",
    "houston and sli  @xcite give an a posteriori error estimator in @xmath1-norm for the linear time - dependent convection - diffusion problem using the duality argument . chen and ji  @xcite give sharp a posteriori error estimations of elm in @xmath2-norm for linear and nonlinear convection - diffusion problems , respectively . a related @xmath3 a posteriori error bound can be found in chen , nochetto , and schmidt  @xcite for the continuous casting problem ( convection - dominated and nonlinearly degenerated ) .    in the previous error estimators mentioned above , the time residual , which measures the difference between the solutions of two successive time steps ,",
    "is employed as a local indicator for temporal error . on the other hand ,",
    "it is observed that elm is essentially transforming a convection - diffusion problem to a parabolic problem along the characteristics . in this paper",
    ", we consider a posteriori error estimators for elm , with focus on temporal error estimators .",
    "motivated by nochetto , savar , and verdi  @xcite , in which adaptive time - stepping scheme for an abstract evolution equation @xmath4 in hilbert spaces is analyzed , we can obtain an a posteriori error bound for the temporal error along the characteristics .",
    "combined with space adaptivity , adaptive method has been designed and implemented .",
    "our numerical experiments in section  [ sec : numer ] suggest that the new a posteriori error estimator is effective .",
    "moreover , the numerical results also indicate that the proposed error estimators are very efficient and can take advantage of the fact that elm allows larger time stepsize .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "elm ] , we introduce a model problem and its eulerian  lagrangian discretization . in section  [ sec : time ] , we discuss temporal a posteriori and a priori error analysis for the linear convection - diffusion problem . in section  [ sec : full ] , we present a posteriori error estimation for the full - discretization . to simplify the discussion ,",
    "we only consider a linear convection - diffusion model problem and restrict ourselves to the standard residual - type estimator for the spatial error , although the technique discussed in this paper can be potentially extended to other problems and spatial error estimators . in section  [ sec",
    ": numer ] , we consider the implementation of our adaptive algorithm and present some numerical experiments .    throughout this paper , we will use the following notation .",
    "the symbol @xmath5 denotes the space of all square integrable functions and its norm is denoted by @xmath6 .",
    "let @xmath7 be the standard sobolev space of the scalar function whose weak derivatives up to order @xmath8 are square integrable , and , let @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the standard sobolev norm and its corresponding seminorm on @xmath7 , respectively . furthermore ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 denote the norm @xmath9 and the semi - norm @xmath13 restricted to the domain @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "we also use the notation @xmath15 for the functions that belong to @xmath7 and their trace vanish on @xmath16 .",
    "the dual space of @xmath17 is denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "we use the notation @xmath19 to denote the existence of a generic constant @xmath20 , which depends only on @xmath21 , such that @xmath22 .",
    "in this paper , we consider the following linear convection - diffusion model problem @xmath23\\ ] ] with the initial condition @xmath24 and the boundary condition @xmath25.\\ ] ] here @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) is bounded polygonal domain .",
    "we assume that @xmath28 is divergence free and vanishes on @xmath16 for @xmath29 $ ] .",
    "we assume that @xmath30 and @xmath31 .      in this section",
    ", we briefly recall the construction of the eulerian  lagrangian method . as usual , we introduce the characteristics ( particle trajectory ) @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the _ lagrangian coordinate _",
    "( original labeling ) at time @xmath34 of the particle .",
    "it is also referred to the material coordinate .",
    "and @xmath35 is the _ eulerian coordinate _ at the current time and referred to as reference coordinate .",
    "then for the given velocity field @xmath36 , the characteristics is defind by the following ordinary differential equation : @xmath37 in the eulerian coordinates , be chain rule , the material derivative is defined as following @xmath38 and then we can rewrite as follow @xmath39    in order to avoid the deformation of the mesh , elm uses a fixed spatial mesh at each time - step and traces back along the characteristics .",
    "the characteristics at each time interval @xmath40 $ ] ( @xmath41 ) has the same original labeling @xmath33 .",
    "assume that @xmath42 and @xmath43.\\ ] ] we discretize the material derivative in using the backward euler method as follows @xmath44 here , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath48 is a function of @xmath33 in the lagrangian coordinate .",
    "we usually refer to as the temporal semi - discretization scheme .      our a posteriori error estimate base on the assumption that the characteristics are solved exactly , which preserves the determinant of the jacobian of the flow .",
    "in the numerical analysis , it is difficult to do that and it was apparent that a computational realization of preserving the determinant of the jacobian for the flow map to be one was crucial .",
    "therefore , we discuss how to integrate the following ordinary differential equation for the computation of the characteristic feet .",
    "the numerical scheme we discuss here has second order accuracy and preserves the determinant of the jacobian of the flow .    @xmath49    where @xmath50    the equation ( [ eq : source ] ) is often called the source - free dynamical systems due to ( [ div : free ] ) .",
    "for such a system , the solution @xmath51 is often called the flow map or phase flow and it has the following property .    @xmath52    we shall begin with introducing some popular scheme to compute ( [ eq : source ] ) and showing that the scheme is indeed volume - preserving scheme for @xmath53 but not for @xmath54 .",
    "we will then introduce some volume preserving scheme to solve ( [ eq : source ] ) for @xmath54 , which is due to feng and shang  @xcite .    in literatures , the following second order numerical scheme for solving ( [ eq : source ] )",
    "is popular and it seems to first appear in @xcite .",
    "first , we integrate the equation ( [ eq : source ] ) using the mid - point rule to obtain :    @xmath55    where @xmath56 .",
    "second , the right hand side is approximated by a second order accurate extrapolation .",
    "namely ,    @xmath57    the following approximation shall also be used : @xmath58    for notational conveniences , let us denote @xmath59 and @xmath60 hence we have the following implicit approximations : @xmath61    to see that the mid - point rule ( [ mid : rule ] ) results in the volume - preserving scheme , let us take the derivative with respect to @xmath35 for both sides of ( [ mid : rule ] ) .",
    "we then obtain the following : @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64    we solve ( [ eq : mid ] ) for @xmath65 and obtain that @xmath66    under the assumption that some appropriate finite element space for the velocity field is used so that the divergence free condition of the velocity field is imposed in the discrete sense , we have @xmath67 from ( [ eq : tr ] ) , we conclude that @xmath68 identically .",
    "the main reason why such an algorithm is popular seems that it has the volume preserving property . on the other hand , it is easy to see that the algorithm may not result in the volume - preserving scheme for @xmath54 .",
    "note that for @xmath54 , under the assumption that @xmath69 , for @xmath70 given as follows , @xmath71 we have that @xmath72    our purpose here is that by reviewing the volume - preserving scheme in three dimension developed by feng and shang in @xcite , we wish to make sure such a volume preserving scheme can be devised in three dimension and confirm our numerical scheme can be implemented .",
    "as far as the author is concerned , such a special algorithmic detail has not been implemented in the context of the semi - lagrangian scheme .",
    "the basic idea of constructing the volume preserving scheme for @xmath73 is based upon the following observation .",
    "following the idea of h. weyl , we have :    @xmath74    where @xmath75    the actual expressions for @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath78 and @xmath79 as follows : @xmath80 from this , it is easy to see that ( [ hw : decomp ] ) holds and by construction @xmath81 and @xmath82 given as follows are divergence free : @xmath83    let us now denote @xmath84 by the volume preserving scheme for @xmath85    with @xmath86 , then the following composition is trivially volume preserving : @xmath87    moreover , assuming @xmath88 is of second order accurate , it is easy to see that the composition ( [ com : vol ] ) is of second order .",
    "the above idea on the composition is from feng and shang , @xcite .      discretizing with suitable spatial discretizations , we obtain fully discrete numerical schemes . in this paper , we focus on the finite element method .",
    "first , we define the weak forms of and as usual .",
    "we define the bilinear form @xmath89 as follow @xmath90 we denote the potential by @xmath91 and its frechet derivative by @xmath92 , i.e. , @xmath93    it is easy to see that @xmath94 is convex and @xmath92 satisfies the following inequality @xmath95 in fact , it is well - known that we have the following identity , @xmath96 where @xmath97 . furthermore , by taking the test function as @xmath98 in and applying , we obtain that @xmath99    the weak forms of ( [ eqn : sl_model ] ) and ( [ eqn : td_sl_model ] ) can be written as @xmath100 and @xmath101 respectively .    on a shape - regular triangulation @xmath102 of @xmath21 , we introduce the piecewise continuous linear finite element space @xmath103 such that @xmath104 let @xmath105 and @xmath106 denote the mesh and the finite element space at time @xmath107 respectively .",
    "then the fully discrete scheme can be written as : suppose @xmath108 is known , find @xmath109 such that @xmath110 where @xmath111 is some suitable approximation of @xmath112 .",
    "in this section , we focus on the a posteriori error estimation for temporal semi - discretization ( [ eqn : td_sl_model ] ) . for the sake of simplicity , we assume that @xmath113 in this section .",
    "different from the standard time error indicators for elm , which measure the solution difference along the time direction , our new error indicator measures the difference along the characteristics .",
    "we will establish a posteriori error estimation based on the new time error indicator and show its efficiency .",
    "we will also show an optimal priori error bound as a byproduct . here",
    "optimality does not only mean the optimal convergence rate which can also be achieved by classic error analysis , but also mean the optimal regularity requirement which have not been proved by standard a priori error analysis .",
    "we first show that the solution of satisfies an energy identity along characteristics .",
    "in fact , by taking inner product with @xmath114 on both side of and applying the following identity @xmath115 we immediately obtain that @xmath116 we can see that the convection diffusion equation preserve the total energy along characteristics in continuous level .    on the other hand , by choosing the test function @xmath117 in and employing , we have an discrete energy inequality : for any integer @xmath118 , @xmath119 we note that the equality holds in if there is no temporal discretization error .",
