    "( see table 1 in evans 1999 ) and hco@xmath0 has a higher opacity for typical abundances .",
    "therefore , it is possible that the hco@xmath0 @xmath1 line traces late stages of infall , when densities and opacities are lower , than the other lines .    to test this possibility and to study how the infall signature changes with time , one of the hco@xmath0 evolutionary models presented in gregersen et al .   has been extended to later times and collapse models have done for cs and h@xmath2co at those same times .",

    "the cloud had 30 shells , 15 inside the infall radius and 15 outside .",
    "the model produces the velocity , density , kinetic temperature , turbulent width and molecular abundance for each shell . the same abundance ( 6 @xmath21 10@xmath41 ) was used for each molecule so these models would be the simplest possible comparisons of molecular tracers .",
    "the output of the collapsing cloud simulation was used as input for a monte carlo code ( choi et al .",

    "the output of the monte carlo code was used as input for a program that convolves a gaussian beam with the emission from the cloud so we can simulate our hco@xmath0 cso observations and the h@xmath2co iram and cs haystack observations of mardones et al .",
    "the distance to the model cloud was 310 pc , the average distance to the observed sources .",
    "the resulting line profiles are plotted in figure 8 .",
    "the hco@xmath0 line profiles are the strongest and , at late times , the most asymmetric .",
    "the dashed horizontal line across each panel is the blue - red ratio . for cs and h@xmath2co ,",

    "the velocity of the blue - shifted peak becomes more negative with time from about @xmath42  to about @xmath43 .",
    "the profiles in figure 8 support the conclusion that hco@xmath0 @xmath1 reveals infall more readily than the cs and h@xmath38co lines .",
    "however , the model line profiles for those molecules predict a detectable signature as well .",

    "1992 , park et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "one can question the relevance of our simulation , because none of the observed sources can be completely explained by the simple inside - out collapse model .",
    "for example , the simulated line profiles often have less extreme blue - red ratios than most of our infall candidates and the dip is much more extreme than in the observations .",
    "all of these sources are either turbulent , aspherical , or have very energetic bipolar outflows .",
    "outflow is a large problem for hco@xmath0 @xmath1 because emission from outflows is prominent in this line . also , recent studies of pre - protostellar cores ( e.g. tafalla et al .  1999 ) ,",

    "the hco@xmath0 @xmath1 line has both advantages and disadvantages in searching for infall . in the following section",

    "three of these sources are class 0 , four are class i and two are probably class i. however , a blue - peaked optically thick line alone is not enough for a definite claim of infall .",
    "for such a claim , the optically thin line must peak in the self - absorption dip of the optically thick line .",
    "we have observed the h@xmath18co@xmath0 @xmath1 line in 4 of our sources . in l1251b , ngc 1333 iras 2 and iras 23011 , this condition is met . for sources where we did not observe the h@xmath18co@xmath0 @xmath1 line",
    ", we used the n@xmath2h@xmath0 @xmath13 line of mardones et al .  to provide a rest velocity . among the sources with blue peaks , n@xmath2h@xmath0 peaks in the dip of cb244 , tmc-1a , iras 03235 and iras 04166 , so we consider these to be good infall candidates . in b228 ,",
    "the n@xmath2h@xmath0 line is at the same velocity as the hco@xmath0 self - absorption dip , so we believe the h@xmath18co@xmath0 @xmath1 line may be optically thick in this source and we consider it to be a possible infall candidate .",
    "all the candidates that could have passed this test did so .",
    "since these sources have been observed in three optically thick lines , cs , h@xmath2co and hco@xmath0 , with roughly comparable beamsizes , we can rank the worthiness of these sources as infall candidates ( table 6 ) .",
    "sources with a blue asymmetry in each of the three lines are the strongest infall candidates while those with blue asymmetries in two lines are the next strongest down to sources with one blue asymmetry . in each category , sources that display either blue or no asymmetry in each of the three lines are considered stronger candidates than those with red asymmetries",
    ". sources above b228 are considered infall candidates .",
    "we include the hcn results of park et al .  for completeness , but consider them a secondary criteria since their beam was 1 , larger than that in the observations of gregersen et al .",
    "and mardones et al .",
    "based on these criteria , l1251b is the strongest infall candidate of the sources studied here and is followed by cb244 . among the other six sources with infall asymmetry in hco@xmath0 , ngc 1333 iras 2 has an h@xmath2co spectrum with a strong red peak and so is ruled out as an infall candidate since outflow seems likely as the explanation for the asymmetric profiles .",
    "we have observed 16 class i and 18 class 0 sources in hco@xmath0 @xmath1 .",
    "nine sources have a blue asymmetry and six have a red asymmetry .",
    "infall asymmetries as defined by mardones et al .",

    "( 1996 ) that l1251b is an infall candidates .",
    "ngc 1333 iras 2 is ruled out as an infall candidate , but has the weakest claim of any source studied here since it has blue asymmetry in hco@xmath0 and red asymmetry in h@xmath2co .",
    "although all the sources in this paper are young and protostellar , making an unambiguous claim for infall is somewhat difficult .",
    "if these sources are undergoing infall , then surely all of these sources should have blue asymmetries in every line .",
    "there is the optical depth effect previously mentioned where cs and h@xmath2co are optically thinner than hco@xmath0 .",
    "however , there is also the problem that infall velocities are roughly the same speed or less than turbulent and outflow motions . in the infall model",
    "previously presented , if such a source was observed with the resolution of our and mardones et al.s observations , at the radius of our beam , @xmath4 25 , for a source at 310 pc , infall speeds range from .07  at the earliest times to 0.60 at the latest stages . in real cores , for example , l1544 , a pre - protostellar core probably at the beginning of the collapse phase , infall speeds are @xmath4 .1 ( tafalla et al .",
    "other caveats include beam size , the particular molecular transition chosen and the source mass .",
    "detecting infall is a challenge .    for future work",
    ", we should observe co to determine what velocity ranges are affected by outflows .",
    "also , we should observe even later class i sources to see if asymmetry is still common .",
