    "at the time of cycle minimum , the solar corona is more or less axisymmetric and stable for many months .",
    "the polar coronal holes are separated by an equatorial streamer belt that encircles the sun .",
    "the fast solar wind originates from the coronal holes , while the slow wind originates from the vicinity of the streamer belt .",
    "the physical processes that drive the fast and slow wind are only partially understood .",
    "in particular , it is unclear why the sun has such a bimodal outflow pattern with distinctly different physical conditions in the fast and slow wind . does this distinction between",
    "fast and slow wind already exist at low heights in the corona , or does it arise only at larger distance from the sun ? what causes the transition from fast to slow wind as we approach the solar equator ?",
    "what is the role of open and closed magnetic fields in this transition ? to answer such questions , an empirical description of the corona is needed ; i.e. , a description of temperature , density , velocity and magnetic field as function of latitude , longitude and radial distance from the sun .",
    "such modeling is a necessary step in the study of the physical processes by which the fast and slow wind are generated .",
    "axisymmetric , semi - empirical models of the solar corona have been developed by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "for example , @xcite used empirically derived electron density profiles to construct a model of the magnetic field , outflow velocity , effective temperature , and effective heat flux .",
    "these parameters are derived by solving the equations for conservation of mass , momentum and energy , and the magnetic induction equation .",
    "the model provides an estimate of the large - scale surface magnetic field at the sun , which is estimated to be 12 - 15 g. the authors predict that the large - scale surface field is dominated by an octupole term .",
    "more recently , three - dimensional models of the corona have also been developed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper",
    "we develop a coronal model that synthesizes observational data obtained with instruments on the _ solar and heliospheric observatory _ ( _ soho _ ) satellite , in particular data from the ultraviolet coronagraph spectrometer ( uvcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "uvcs observations have shown that the minor ions in coronal holes have kinetic temperatures that are much larger than those for protons and electrons @xcite . here",
    "kinetic temperature refers to the total velocity dispersion of the particles , including thermal and non - thermal components .",
    "detailed analysis of kinetic temperatures for different ions has shown that some ions have higher temperature than others , indicating _ preferential heating _ of certain ions .",
    "furthermore , doppler dimming analysis of spectral lines such as o vi @xmath61032 and 1037 has shown that some minor ions have _ anisotropic velocity distributions _ :",
    "the velocity dispersion perpendicular to the ( nearly radial ) magnetic field in coronal holes is significantly larger than that parallel to the field .",
    "this high temperature and large temperature anisotropy of the ions is believed to be caused by dissipation of transverse waves @xcite . a similar but smaller anisotropy",
    "may also exist for the protons @xcite . in the presence of a diverging magnetic field , charged particles experience an outward force that causes the perpendicular motion of the particles to be converted into parallel motion .",
    "therefore , if the perpendicular energy of the protons is continually replenished by wave dissipation , the protons can maintain an anisotropic velocity distribution ( @xmath7 ) and there is a net outward force on the protons .",
    "this so - called mirror force plays an important role in driving the fast solar wind ( see review by * ? ? ?",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to include the effects of proton temperature anisotropy into a global model of the solar corona .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "2 we discuss observations of streamers and the relationship between the streamer and the slow solar wind . in ",
    "3 we present observational constraints on our global model , including temperature and density in the corona and magnetic flux at the coronal base . in ",
    "4 we present a method for solving the coronal force balance equations , taking into account the mirror force . in  5",
    "we present our model results for coronal magnetic structure and outflow velocity . in ",
    "6 we derive images of visible light polarization brightness and h i ly@xmath5 intensities from our model , and we compare our results with observations . the main results of this work are discussed in  7 .",
    "the k corona is produced by thomson scattering of photospheric white light by free electrons in the corona . in a study of the solar minimum corona using the large angle and spectrometric coronagraph ( lasco ) on _ soho _ , @xcite found that the large - scale structure of the coronal streamer belt at 3 @xmath1 and beyond can be reproduced with a model in which the scattering electrons are concentrated around a single , warped current sheet that encircles the sun .",
    "the angular width of this sheet is only a few degrees .",
    "the bright , narrow spikes seen in lasco c2 and c3 images occur wherever the sheet is oriented edge - on in the plane of the sky @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the latitudinal extent of the slow wind , as determined from _ in - situ _ measurements , is about @xmath8 @xcite , much larger than the thickness of the coronal plasma sheet observed with lasco .",
    "this implies that the bulk of the slow wind originates from open field lines outside the observed plasma sheet @xcite .",
    "@xcite used time - lapse sequences of lasco images to track the outward motion of small density enhancements ( `` blobs '' ) in the plasma sheet .",
    "these blobs originate in the high corona above the top of the helmet streamer , and slowly accelerate outward though the lasco field of view ( 2.2 - 30 @xmath1 ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that both the blobs and the plasma sheet represent closed - field material injected into the slow wind as a result of foot - point exchanges between the stretched helmet - streamer loops and neighboring open field lines .",
    "according to this model , the ejection of the blobs does not cause any permanent disruption of the helmet streamer , which remains in a stretched , quasi - equilibrium state with its cusp at 3 @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite observed the equatorial streamer with uvcs/_soho _ at radii between 1.5 and 5 @xmath1 .",
    "images of the streamer in o vi @xmath91032 show two bright legs separated by a dark lane .",
    "this lane extends radially along the streamer axis up to 3 @xmath1 ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in contrast , h i ly@xmath5 and white - light images do not show such a dark feature .",
    "this led @xcite to attribute the dark lane to a reduced oxygen abundance along the streamer axis .",
    "@xcite further suggested that this abundance anomaly is due to gravitational settling of oxygen in the static proton / electron plasma of the closed - field streamer core .",
    "if this interpretation is correct , the closed field lines must extend up to 3 @xmath1 , consistent with the model of @xcite .",
    "the o vi images for july 1996 show that the streamer legs converge towards the equator in the range 2 - 2.5 @xmath1 from sun center .",
    "this suggests that the streamer cusp may be located at about 2 @xmath1 , somewhat less than implied by the model of @xcite .",
    "we propose the following scenario .",
    "the blobs observed by @xcite originate at the cusp ( 2 @xmath1 ) , but become clearly visible only at somewhat larger height ( 3 - 4 @xmath1 ) . the plasma within the blobs originates in the closed - field streamer core , which is affected by gravitational settling .",
    "therefore , the blobs have low oxygen abundance compared to the surrounding slow solar wind . as the blobs move out into the region between 2 and 3 @xmath1 , they contribute to reduced o vi emission along the axis of the streamer . in this way , the effects of gravitational settling are transmitted to larger height via the blobs .",
    "in contrast , the open field lines farther away from the streamer axis always have a slow outflow and therefore are unaffected by settling .",
    "@xcite measured @xmath3 outflow velocities in streamers using the doppler dimming effect . in a latitudinal scan at 2.33 @xmath1 , strachan et al .  found no measurable outflow velocity within the streamer ( @xmath10 km / s ) , but a steep rise in outflow velocity occurs just beyond the bright streamer legs .",
    "the latitudinal width of the streamer , as defined by the point where the outflow velocity equals 100 km / s , is about @xmath8 ( see fig .",

    "* ) , similar to the observed width of the slow wind at large distance from the sun @xcite .",
    "this section describes the observational constraints on coronal density , temperature , and magnetic flux to be used in  4 .",
    "the polarized brightness ( @xmath4 ) of the k corona can be used to measure the coronal electron density @xcite .",
    "here we use the results of @xcite and @xcite , who used _ skylab _ data from 1973 - 1974 to derive electron density profiles for coronal holes and streamers at cycle minimum ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "their results are expressed in terms of radial profiles , one for the polar coronal hole , another for the equatorial streamer .",
    "they used the following expression for the electron density within each component : @xmath11 , \\label{eq : density1}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the heliocentric distance in units of @xmath1 , and the parameters @xmath13 are given by @xcite .",
    "the density profiles are shown in figure [ fig : dens ] .",
    "the _ skylab _ data span the height range @xmath14 and were further extrapolated using data from the ulysses mission @xcite .",
    "these measurements correspond to select days when the equatorial streamer belt was seen approximately end - on .",
    "this explains why their streamer densities are somewhat larger than those of @xcite , who presented streamer densities averaged over many days .      one method for inferring the electron temperature @xmath15 is to use spectral line intensity ratios of two lines from the same ion .",
    "@xcite used data from sumer/_soho _ to estimate @xmath15 at radii 1.03 - 1.6 @xmath1 in coronal holes at the last cycle minimum ( 1996 - 1997 ) .",
    "they use mg ix 706  and 750  , and they conclude that in both the plume and inter - plume regions the electrons barely reach the canonical temperature of 1 mk . moreover , @xmath16 falls off rapidly with height .",
    "although their temperature estimates depend on atomic data that , according to the authors , could be improved , their work suggests that in polar hole regions the electrons are significantly cooler than the ions ( see * ? ? ? * for a quantitative analysis on uncertainties of @xmath15 estimates , derived from be - like line ratios and using different theoretical methods ) .",
    "the rates of ionization and recombination of coronal ions decrease rapidly with distance from the sun .",
    "therefore , the charge state of the solar wind is determined in large part by the electron temperature @xmath15 in the inner corona where the ionization and recombination times are still short compared to the solar wind expansion time . _ in situ _ measurements of the solar wind charge state can be used to estimate the coronal electron temperature .",
    "@xcite derived polar @xmath15 profiles from observations with swics / ulysses .",
    "their results can be approximated as a combination of two power laws ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : @xmath17}. \\label{eq : te1}\\ ] ] @xcite and @xcite studied the ionization balance of various ions in a streamer observed with uvcs/_soho _ in july 1996 .",
    "the results indicate that @xmath15 reaches a maximum value of about 1.6 mk in the streamer core . due to the high density and low outflow velocity in streamers ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we expect that protons and electrons are in thermal equilibrium with each other , so the electrons may be used as a proxy for the protons . @xcite and @xcite",
    "show that their observations are compatible with hydrostatic equilibrium in the streamer core ( * ? ? ?",
    "* also see ) . in this paper",
    "we derive the electron temperature @xmath18 from the observed electron density @xmath19 , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "in this paper we use a generalization of expression ( [ eq : te1 ] ) to describe the radial variation of electron temperature at the pole and the equator : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the temperature at the coronal base ( @xmath22 ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath5 and @xmath2 are given in table 1 , and the profiles are shown in figure [ fig : tprof ] . the electron temperature model at the poles ( dashed line ) has been adjusted to approximately fit the observational data of @xcite and @xcite ( _ triangles _ ) .",
    "the electrons are assumed to have a maxwellian velocity distribution . the electron temperature at the equator ( thick line ) is assumed to be equal to the proton temperature , discussed in the next section .",
    "ion temperatures can be estimated by measuring the width of coronal emission line profiles . due to rapid charge exchange between protons and neutral hydrogen ,",
    "the latter can be used as a proxy for the protons .",
    "@xcite studied the coupling between neutral hydrogen and protons by treating the hydrogen atoms as test particles in a proton - electron background .",
    "their work indicates that the h i velocity distribution reflects the proton distribution at radii up to about 3 @xmath1 in the polar regions and even higher in the equatorial regions . above 3 @xmath1 in the polar regions",
    ", the h i velocity distribution `` follows '' the proton distribution and reaches temperatures about 20% higher than the protons .",
    "these results strongly support the use of h i ly@xmath5 profiles to measure the velocity spread of the protons along the line of sight ( los ) .",
    "the observed velocity spread includes both thermal and non - thermal components ( such as wave motions ) , and may also include a contribution from solar wind expansion in the direction along the los ( most emission originates near the point of closest approach to the sun , but there is some contribution from regions behind and in front of the plane of the sky where the solar wind velocity has a component along the los ) .",
    "therefore , the velocity spread derived from the observed line width provides only an upper limit on the proton temperature : @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the observed @xmath27 velocity spread , @xmath28 is the hydrogen mass and @xmath29 is boltzmann s constant . at the time of cycle minimum ,",
    "the polar coronal holes are very large , and polar observations at @xmath30 are unaffected by low - latitude streamers .",
    "uvcs/_soho _ observations of heavier ions such as @xmath3 show that the velocity distributions of these ions in coronal holes are highly _ anisotropic _ : the velocity spread in the radial direction ( as derived from doppler dimming analysis ) is much smaller than that in the tangential direction @xcite .",
    "it is unclear whether this anisotropy also exists for the protons ; doppler dimming analysis of h i lyman lines does not provide strong constraints on the proton parallel velocity in coronal holes .",
    "the @xmath3 anisotropy is believed to be due to the damping of transverse waves ( e.g. , due to ion - cyclotron resonance ) , and this perpendicular heating may also occur for the protons . in this paper",
    "we assume that the protons indeed have an anisotropic velocity distribution in the low - density polar regions ( @xmath31 ) , but not in the equatorial region ( @xmath32 ) . since the magnetic field over the pole is approximately radial and perpendicular to the los , the observed h i ly@xmath5 line width provides an estimate for the proton _ perpendicular _ temperature .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the proton parallel temperature equals the ( isotropic ) electron temperature , @xmath33 , so that the radial variation of @xmath34 at the pole and equator is given by equation ( [ eq : te2 ] ) with parameter values given in table 1 .",
    "the anisotropy in proton temperature over the pole is consistent with _ in - situ _ measurements , which show that @xmath35 in the solar wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite analyzed h i ly@xmath5 line profiles observed in polar coronal holes during the past cycle minimum ( 1996 - 1997 ) .",
    "their results indicate proton perpendicular temperatures up to 6 mk .",
    "the observed velocity width ( @xmath26 ) increases rapidly with height from about 190 km / s ( @xmath36 mk ) at 1.5 @xmath1 , to 240 km / s ( @xmath37 mk ) at 2.5 @xmath1 , and then slowly decreases to 250 km / s ( @xmath38 mk ) at 4 @xmath1 .",
    "the results are consistent with earlier measurements from uvcs/_spartan _ by @xcite , who found peak temperatures of 5 - 6 mk at 2.25 @xmath1 and 3.5 mk at 3.5 @xmath1 in a polar coronal hole in 1993 . from these several observations , measured temperatures at different heights are shown by asterisks in figure [ fig : tprof ] .",
    "uvcs/_soho _ observations in the equatorial regions indicate a roughly constant proton temperature within the core of the streamer belt .",
    "we reanalyzed uvcs data from a super - synoptic campaign during july 1996 @xcite , and find ly@xmath5 line widths of order 185 km / s ( @xmath39 mk ) at 1.5 @xmath1 and 195 km / s ( @xmath36 mk ) at 2.6 @xmath1 . at larger heights ,",
    "the line widths decrease to 170 km / s ( @xmath40 mk ) at 3 @xmath1 and 150 km / s ( @xmath41 mk ) at 4.5 @xmath1 .",
    "the measurements are shown by the crosses in figure [ fig : tprof ] .",
    "streamer observations by @xcite , obtained about a month after the raymond observations , exhibit very similar values ( 2.2 mk at 2 @xmath1 , 1.5 mk at 4 @xmath1 ) .",
    "in this paper we use the following expression for the proton perpendicular temperature : @xmath42 the first term is similar to that used for the electron temperature , but the second term allows us to impose a further increase in temperature over a limited range of heights ( of order @xmath43 ) , consistent with uvcs observations .",
    "the values of the parameters at the pole and at the equator are given in table 1 .",
    "in summary , our temperature models present the following main features : ( 1 ) at the pole , strong anisotropy for protons , and electron temperature much lower than @xmath44 ; ( 2 ) at the equator , hydrostatic equilibrium isotropic velocity distributions and thermal equilibrium between species .",

    "the average radial field is very small ( less than 2 g ) .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath54 is related to @xmath118 via equation ( [ eq : bvec ] ) , and @xmath119 . at each step in our iterative procedure , @xmath98 is a known function , so @xmath120 depends only on the unknown function @xmath121 , or equivalently , @xmath111 .",

    "the results for the first and last iterations are shown in figures [ fig : fld]a and [ fig : fld]b , respectively .",
    "the _ thin _",
    "curves represent magnetic field lines , and the _ thick _ curves are contours of @xmath149 , the ratio of perpendicular gas pressure @xmath150 and magnetic pressure @xmath151 .",
    "the cusp height in the final solution is @xmath152 .",
    "note that the magnetic structure changes little between the first and last iterations .",
    "our model yields @xmath153 in the polar regions , but @xmath154 in the equatorial streamer , especially near the streamer cusp .",
    "this supports the idea that the streamer is magnetically contained by the strong polar fields that surround it on either side @xcite .",
    "we find that @xmath154 throughout the closed - field region of the streamer . however , the variation with height is not monotonic : @xmath2 has peaks at both the cusp and the streamer base , and lower values at intermediate heights .",
    "our results are similar to those of @xcite , who estimated @xmath2 based on uvcs/_soho _ and sxt/_yohkoh _ observations of streamers ( july 1996 ) in combination with potential field extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic field .",
    "their estimates indicate @xmath155 at 1.15 @xmath1 and @xmath156 at 1.50 @xmath1 , similar to the values found here .",
    "high values of @xmath2 were also found in mhd models that include heat and momentum deposition in the corona @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : velo ] shows the outflow velocity for the final model .",
    "the bright region is the fast solar wind emanating from the coronal hole , and the dark region is the slow wind that flows along the open field lines within the streamer .",
    "the maximum velocities are about 450 km / s for the fast wind and 190 km / s for the slow wind .",
    "this is somewhat smaller than the observed _ in - situ _ values at 1 au ( 800 and 400 km / s , respectively ) .",
    "we attribute this difference to the fact that our model does not include any momentum deposition effects other than the mirror force .",
    "however , the ratio of fast and slow wind speeds is about 2.5 in our model , consistent with _ in - situ _ measurements .",
    "figure [ fig : across ] shows three quantities measured across magnetic field lines : the temperature anisotropy at 3 @xmath1 , the radial position @xmath157 of the sonic point , and the asymptotic wind speed .",
    "note that the variation of wind speed closely follows that of the temperature anisotropy ( compare top and bottom panels ) .",
    "this indicates that the fast wind is driven by the high perpendicular temperatures in the coronal hole , and the decrease in wind speed at the edge of the hole is mainly due to the decrease in temperature anisotropy .",
    "the middle panel shows that there is a sudden jump in sonic - point radius once the transition from high to low temperature anisotropy is nearly complete .",
    "the jump occurs at @xmath158 and is due to the appearance of a second ( lower ) minimum in the function @xmath144 at a height well beyond the streamer cusp ( see below ) . as a result , the sonic - point radius changes discontinuously from about 1.5 @xmath1 in the coronal hole to about 5.5 @xmath1 in the streamer .",
    "such large values for the sonic - point height in the streamer were found earlier by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "most of the decrease in wind speed occurs for @xmath159 between 0.6 and 0.77 , well before the jump in sonic - point height , and the asymptotic wind speed does not change significantly at the jump .    to show the transition between fast and slow wind more clearly , figure [ fig : trans ] shows various quantities along field lines near the fast - slow boundary ( the same line styles are used in all panels ) .",
    "panel ( a ) show the shapes of the field lines in the meridional plane .",
    "panel ( b ) shows the function @xmath144 defined in equation ( [ eq : fs ] ) and plotted as function of radial distance @xmath12 for four field lines .",
    "note that the _ triple - dot - dashed _ curve has a minimum at about 1.5 @xmath1 , whereas the _ full _ curve has two minima , one at 1.7 @xmath1 and another at 5.5 @xmath1 . as shown in  4.2 ,",
    "these minima indicate possible positions of the sonic point ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "panel ( d ) shows the radial positions @xmath160 of such minima as function of field - line variable @xmath58 . in general",
    ", a global solution of the wind equation ( [ eq : wind2 ] ) can be found only when the integration is started at the _ global _ minimum , i.e. , the minimum with the lowest value of @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , as we move from the _ triple - dot - dashed _ field lines to the _ dot - dashed _ line , there is a discontinuous jump in the height of the sonic point .",
    "figure  [ fig : trans]c shows the outflow velocity @xmath162 along field lines near the fast - slow boundary .",
    "the _ dotted _ curve in this panel is the wind solution along the last open field line , @xmath163 .",
    "as we move from the coronal hole into the streamer , the wind speed at large height closely follows the decrease in perpendicular temperature , which mainly occurs between the two _ full - thick _ profiles .",
    "however , a further decrease occurs at lower heights ( @xmath164 @xmath1 ) between the _ triple - dot - dashed _ and _ dot - dashed _ field lines due to the jump in height of the sonic point .",
    "we conclude that , unlike the terminal speed , the low - height behavior of @xmath162 is strongly affected by the height of the sonic point .",
    "such a region of stagnated flow was found earlier by many authors ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    figure  [ fig : trans]e shows the non - radial expansion factor of the slow - wind flow tubes , @xmath165 , where @xmath166 in the field strength at the coronal base for each field line .",
    "note that @xmath167 is a non - monotonic function of radius for these field lines .",
    "the peak in @xmath167 is due to the fact that these field lines pass close to the streamer cusp where @xmath168 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath167 increases monotonically for field lines in the coronal hole ( not shown ) .",
    "it is remarkable to see that this `` cusp effect '' occurs at large distance from the cusp : the peak in @xmath167 occurs for all field lines within about 1 @xmath1 from the equatorial plane ( see figure  [ fig : trans]a ) .",
    "triple - dot - dashed _ field line at which the peak in @xmath169 first develops is close to the field line where the jump in sonic - point height occurs .",
    "this is consistent with the suggestion by @xcite , @xcite and others that the existence of the slow wind is due to the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath170 .",
    "we suggest here that the decrease in perpendicular temperature as we approach the equatorial plane also plays an important role .    to determine whether the `` cusp effect '' is due to the effects of gas pressure on the expansion of the flow tubes , we computed a partially open potential magnetic field with the same photospheric boundary conditions [ see equation ( [ eq : bbase ] ) ] and a thin current sheet in the equatorial plane for @xmath171 .",
    "the calculation is based on the work of @xcite .",
    "first , the surface flux distribution is expressed in terms of four legendre polynomials @xmath172 with @xmath173 = 1 , 3 , 5 and 7 .",
    "then the field is extrapolated into the corona using equations ( b3 ) and ( b4 ) of @xcite for @xmath173 = 1 and 3 ( for @xmath173 = 5 and 7 the effect of the current sheet can be neglected ) . we found that @xmath167 has a peak for all open field lines that pass below the point @xmath174 = ( 3.0,1.4 ) @xmath1 , where @xmath175 is the distance from the rotation axis , and @xmath176 is the height above the equatorial plane .",
    "therefore , the effect of the streamer cusp -located at the point @xmath174 = ( 1.95,0 ) @xmath1- is present even in a potential field , and its spatial extent is similar to what was found in the numerical model ( i.e. , the effect is not due to the finite plasma @xmath2 ) .    for the value of @xmath75 chosen in this paper ( @xmath78 = 0.7 ) ,",
    "the transition between fast and slow wind far from the sun occurs at latitudes of @xmath8 .",
    "this is consistent with ulysses observations taken at the time of cycle minimum @xcite . at lower heights , the low speeds in the streamer legs found in our model are consistent with uvcs measurements of @xmath3 outflow velocity using the doppler dimming technique @xcite . in a latitudinal scan at 2.33 @xmath1",
    ", @xcite found no measurable outflow velocity in the streamer ( @xmath177 km / s ) , but a steep rise in velocity occurs just beyond the bright streamer legs .",
    "the observed latitudinal half - width of the streamer at 2.33 @xmath1 , as defined by the points where the outflow velocity equals 100 km / s , is about @xmath178 .",
    "our model predicts a half - width of @xmath179 .",
    "therefore , the predicted width of the streamer is roughly consistent with observations at both large and small heights .",
    "it should be noted that we use a realistic photospheric flux distribution that is peaked at the pole , @xmath180 [ g ] , whereas @xcite and @xcite assume a bipolar distribution , @xmath181 . for a given fraction of open magnetic flux",
    ", the assumed flux distribution has a significant effect on the size of the polar coronal hole , the latitudinal width of the streamer core , and the magnitude of the non - radial expansion factor .",
    "however , potential field models indicate that the spatial extent of the cusp effect is similar in the two cases .",
    "the coronal density model can be used to predict the polarization brightness ( @xmath4 ) of the visible light that is scattered by free electrons in the corona ( thomson scattering ) .",
    "the @xmath4 is an integral along the los @xcite : @xmath182 where @xmath175 is the distance along the los , @xmath183 is the projected radial distance from sun center , @xmath184 is the true radial distance , @xmath185 @xmath186 is the thomson scattering cross section , @xmath187 @xmath188 is the mean disk intensity , and @xmath189 is the limb darkening coefficient .",
    "the functions @xmath190 and @xmath191 are given by @xcite .",
    "we used our axisymmetric model of the electron density distribution to compute synthetic @xmath4 images for various angles @xmath5 between the los and the solar equatorial plane .",
    "figure [ fig : pb1 ] shows the results for @xmath192 and @xmath193 ; the latter represents a view of the sun from above the ecliptic plane .",
    "we have over - plotted selected field lines in the plane of the sky ( _ white _ curves ) and contours of the ratio of @xmath4 and its maximum value at the equatorial base ( _ black _ curves ) .",
    "the equatorial streamer clearly stands out in the image with @xmath192 , but is less distinct for @xmath194 .    to compare these results with observations , figure  [ fig :",
    "pb2]a shows the radial @xmath4 profiles along the pole and equator , and figure  [ fig : pb2]b shows latitudinal profiles at three different heights ( @xmath183 = 1.15 , 1.5 and 2.5 @xmath1 ) . the _",
    "full _ curves correspond to the edge - on view ( @xmath192 ) .",
    "the symbols represent @xmath4 measurements obtained with the mauna loa mark 3 coronagraph and lasco/_soho _ @xcite and with the visible - light channel on uvcs/_soho _ @xcite .",
    "the data were obtained in 1996 july and august when the equatorial streamer belt is seen approximately edge - on @xcite .",
    "our model fits the observations quite well , although the predicted latitudinal width of the streamer at 2.5 @xmath1 is somewhat larger than observed .",
    "the _ dashed _ curve in figure  [ fig : pb2]a shows the radial profile along the pole for the out - of - ecliptic view ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "note that there is a large increase in @xmath4 compared to the edge - on view .",
    "this is due to the fact that the los crosses the enhanced density equatorial streamer , and is not representative of the available observations of the polar @xmath4 profile .",
    "we also computed the intensity of the strongest uv coronal emission line , h i 1216  ( ly@xmath5 ) , which is formed almost entirely by resonant scattering of chromospheric ly@xmath5 radiation by neutral hydrogen atoms in the corona @xcite .",
    "the integrated intensity of the scattered ly@xmath5 is @xmath195 where @xmath175 measures distance along the los , @xmath196 is the neutral hydrogen density , @xmath12 is the radial distance from sun center at any point along the los , @xmath197/2 $ ] is a geometric dilution factor , @xmath198 is the chromospheric intensity ( in @xmath199 ) as function of frequency @xmath200 ( in hz ) , @xmath201 hz is the line center frequency , @xmath202 is the doppler shift , @xmath203 is the radial component of the outflow velocity , @xmath204 is the scattering profile of the coronal atoms ( due to their thermal and non - thermal velocities ) , and @xmath205 is the einstein coefficient . for a derivation of this expression and discussion of the relevant approximations , see @xcite . the neutral hydrogen density @xmath206 is computed using the collisional ionization rates of @xcite and the recombination rates of @xcite .",
    "we computed ly@xmath5 images for two different viewing angles , using densities , temperatures and velocities from the coronal model .",
    "the results are shown in figure  [ fig : lya1 ] .",
    "although these images look similar to those for polarization brightness , the ly@xmath5 intensity is somewhat sensitive to the outflow velocity .",
    "this is shown more clearly in figure  [ fig : lya2 ] where we plot the radial profiles of ly@xmath5 intensity with and without the doppler dimming effect ( _ full _ and _ dashed _ curves , respectively ) .",
    "note that there is a significant difference between predicted intensities with and without dimming for the polar region , but not for the equatorial region .",
    "therefore , unlike @xmath4 measurements ly@xmath5 intensities provide constraints on the outflow velocity in the acceleration region of the solar wind .",
    "figure [ fig : lya2 ] also compares our model predictions with measurements from uvcs/_soho_. the _ diamonds _ represent measurements taken along the streamer axis , based on our reanalysis of data obtained on 1996 july 26 @xcite .",
    "the _ triangles _ are measurements along the polar axis based on observations from november 1996 to april 1997 @xcite .",
    "note that the predicted ly@xmath5 intensities fit the observations quite well .",
    "this suggests that the model gives a reasonable representation of the velocity field in the inner part of the corona where the main acceleration of the solar wind takes place .",
    "we developed a stationary , axisymmetric mhd model for the global corona .",
    "the model includes a description of the temperature , density , velocity and magnetic field as function of latitude and radius up to 10 @xmath1 from sun center .",
    "the velocity and magnetic fields are obtained by solving the parallel and perpendicular force balance equations , including the effects of inertia , anisotropic gas pressure , gravity and lorentz forces .",
    "the temperature models are based on observational data from uvcs/_soho _ , and the magnetic flux distribution at the coronal base is taken from nso / kitt peak synoptic maps .",
    "the model reproduces the main features of the global corona at the time of cycle minimum .",
    "we find that the high perpendicular temperature of the protons in the coronal hole plays a major role in driving the fast solar wind . in the streamer",
    "we find low outflow velocity and high plasma @xmath2 , consistent with earlier results @xcite .    in our model the wind equation ( [ eq : wind2 ] )",
    "is solved separately for many field lines .",
    "the sonic point along each field line occurs at a minimum of the function @xmath144 that appears on the rhs of the wind equation [ see equation ( [ eq : fs ] ) ] .",
    "the transition from fast to slow wind occurs at an open field line characterized by @xmath207 , where @xmath63 is the boundary between open and closed fields .",
    "the value of @xmath75 was adjusted to obtain the correct latitudinal width of the slow - wind region both at large distance from the sun @xcite and in the corona at 2.33 @xmath1 @xcite . in our model",
    "this transition is associated with two effects : ( 1 ) the decrease of proton perpendicular temperature @xmath208 as we approach the equatorial plane , and ( 2 ) the appearance of a peak in the non - radial expansion factor @xmath167 for field lines that pass close to the streamer cusp ( `` cusp effect '' ) .",
    "the cusp effect is present at surprisingly large distances from the cusp ( @xmath209 @xmath1 ) and is present even in potential - field models , so it is not a consequence of finite plasma @xmath2 .",
    "the combination of decreasing temperature anisotropy and cusp effect causes the global minimum of @xmath144 ( and therefore the sonic point ) to occur well beyond the cusp , and produces low outflow velocity near the cusp .",
    "these results are consistent with the suggestion by @xcite that the slow wind is due to special properties of the geometric spreading along the open field lines that pass near the streamer core ( also see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our model does not provide a physical explanation for the temperature decrease at the fast - slow boundary , and therefore can not explain _ why _ the boundary occurs at @xmath210 .",
    "understanding the physics of the fast - slow transition will require more detailed analysis of the energy balance of the coronal plasma , including the physical processes by which the temperature anisotropy of the protons is maintained .",
    "we speculate that proton perpendicular heating ( by dissipation of transverse mhd waves ) occurs in both the fast and slow winds , perhaps at roughly equal rates",
    ". however , the resulting temperature anisotropy @xmath211 may be quite different in the two cases . in the fast wind ,",
    "proton - proton collisions are less frequent due to the lower density , so the deviations from maxwellian velocity distributions are larger than in the slow wind .",
    "clearly , to understand why the fast - slow transition occurs at @xmath210 will require multi - dimensional models of wave heating and energy balance such a those developed by @xcite .",
