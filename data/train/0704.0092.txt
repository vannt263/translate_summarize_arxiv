    "over the last two decades lattice gauge theory was turned into a powerful qualitative tool for analyzing qcd .",
    "this progress is in part due to the advances in algorithms and computer technology , but also on the conceptual side important breakthroughs were made .",
    "most prominent among these is the correct implementation of chiral symmetry on the lattice based on the ginsparg - wilson equation for the dirac operator @xcite .",
    "an application of lattice techniques which has seen a lot of attention in recent years , is the study of qcd at finite temperature .",
    "the lattice implementation of the chemical potential @xmath0 , necessary for such an analysis , is not straightforward , however .",
    "it is well known @xcite , that a naive introduction leads to @xmath1 contributions which diverge in the continuum limit when the lattice spacing @xmath2 is sent to zero . for more traditional formulations , such as the wilson or staggered dirac operators ,",
    "the problem has been solved by introducing the chemical potential in the same way as the 4-component of the gauge field .",
    "a satisfactory implementation of the chemical potential should be compatible with chiral symmetry on the lattice based on the ginsparg - wilson equation .",
    "when attempting to introduce the chemical potential into the only solution of the ginsparg - wilson equation know in closed form , the overlap operator @xcite , a potential problem quickly surfaces : defining the sign function of a non - hermitian matrix . in @xcite bloch and wettig",
    "proposed a solution based on an analytic continuation of the sign function into the complex plane .",
    "it was shown , that the eigenvalue spectra of this construction match the expectations from random matrix theory .    in this letter",
    "we analyze the proposal @xcite further and study the energy density of free , massless overlap fermions with chemical potential . the dependence of the energy density on @xmath0 and the temperature @xmath3 allows for a detailed analysis of the lattice formulation at finite density .",
    "of particular interest will be the question whether the analytic continuation of the sign function produces divergent @xmath1 terms .",
    "our study indicates the absence of such contributions and we find that the @xmath0 and @xmath3 dependence of the energy density is approached correctly .",

    "periodic boundary conditions are used in the spatial directions , while in time direction we apply anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "the chemical potential @xmath0 is coupled in the usual exponential form @xcite .    for vanishing @xmath0",
    "the wilson dirac operator is @xmath9-hermitian , i.e. ,  @xmath10 .",
    "this implies that @xmath11 is a hermitian matrix .",
    "as soon as the chemical potential @xmath0 is turned on , @xmath9-hermiticity no longer holds , and @xmath12 is a non - hermitian , general matrix .",
    "this fact has two important consequences : firstly , the eigenvalues of @xmath12 are no longer real and the sign function for a complex number has to be defined in the spectral representation of sign@xmath13 .",
    "secondly , the spectral representation has to be formulated using left and right eigenvectors .",
    "this latter problem will be dealt with later when we discuss the evaluation of sign@xmath13 . for the sign function of a complex number we use the analytic continuation proposed in @xcite and define the sign function through the sign of the real part @xmath14",
    "the observable we study here is the energy density defined as @xmath15 } { z } \\ ; = \\label{epsidef } \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{v } \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\beta }   \\ln \\mbox{tr } \\big [ e^{-\\beta ( { \\cal h } - \\mu { \\cal n})}\\big]_{\\beta\\mu = c } \\ ; = \\ ; - \\frac{1}{v } \\frac{\\partial \\ln z}{\\partial \\beta } \\bigg|_{\\beta\\mu = c } \\ ; . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath16 is the hamiltonian of the system , @xmath17 denotes the number operator and @xmath18 is the inverse temperature ( in our units the boltzmann constant @xmath19 is set to @xmath20 ) .",
    "the derivatives in the second line are taken such that @xmath21 const .",
    "the continuum result for the subtracted energy density of free massless fermions reads ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath22    when working on the lattice , the inverse temperature @xmath23 is given by the lattice extent in 4-direction , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "thus the derivative @xmath25 in ( [ epsidef ] ) turns into @xmath26 .",
    "the partition function @xmath27 is given by the fermion determinant @xmath28 which we write as the product over all eigenvalues @xmath29 .",
    "we thus find @xmath30",
    "according to ( [ specsum ] ) , for the evaluation of @xmath31 the eigenvalues @xmath29 of the dirac operator @xmath32 have to be computed .",
    "this is done in three steps : first we bring the dirac operator for free fermions to @xmath33 block - diagonal form , using fourier transformation .",
    "subsequently the spectral representation is applied to the @xmath33 blocks of @xmath34 to evaluate sign @xmath34 .",
    "finally the eigenvalues of the blocks of @xmath32 are computed and by summing over the discrete momenta all eigenvalues are obtained .    following this strategy",

    "the momenta in time - direction are @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "the remaining diagonalization of @xmath35 is similar to the construction of the left- and right - eigenfunctions for the free dirac operator .",

    "the momentum dependence enters through the components @xmath55 defined in ( [ hdefs ] ) . in the spectral sum ( [ specsum ] ) the label @xmath56 runs over all momenta and the eigenvalues at fixed momentum as given in ( [ evals ] ) .",
    "the necessary derivative with respect to @xmath8 is straightforward to compute in closed form , and the spectral sum ( [ specsum ] ) can then be summed numerically .",
    "the argument of the sign function can not become purely imaginary on a finite lattice , and no @xmath57-like terms occur .",
    "we remark , that after taking the derivative with respect to @xmath8 , we set @xmath58 , i.e. , all the results we present are in lattice units .",
    "we begin the discussion of our results with fig .  1 , where we show the subtracted energy density @xmath59 as a function of @xmath60 for three different lattice volumes .",
    "for those lattices all 4 sides have equal length , i.e. , in the thermodynamic limit they correspond to zero temperature .",
    "thus , according to ( [ contresult ] ) , we expect the data ( symbols in fig .  1 ) to approach the continuum form @xmath61 ( dashed line ) as the 4-d volume is sent to infinity .     as a function of @xmath60 ( all in lattice units ) .",
    "the symbols ( connected to guide the eye ) are for various lattice sizes , the dashed line is the continuum result.,width=321 ]    the figure clearly shows that the lattice data are predominantly linear when plotted versus @xmath60 and that for small @xmath0 they approach the continuum curve when the volume is increased .",
    "it is , however , obvious that also on our largest lattice still a discrepancy remains for larger @xmath0 . in particular",
    "one finds a slight curvature upwards , a discretization effect which here , since the lattice spacing is just the inverse lattice extension , is also a finite size effect .",
    "furthermore , for small @xmath0 one expects to see finite temperature corrections according to ( [ contresult ] ) .     as a function of @xmath60 , now for finite temperature lattices ( all in lattice units).,width=321 ]    in order to study these finite temperature corrections systematically , we analyzed lattices with short temporal extent , i.e. , lattices with non - vanishing temperature .",
    "2 shows the corresponding results , where we again plot the subtracted energy density as a function of @xmath60 .    the lattice with the shortest temporal extent , @xmath62 , which corresponds to the largest temperature , shows a clear curvature .",
    "this curvature is due to the @xmath63 term in ( [ contresult ] ) , which appears as a square root when plotted as function of @xmath60 . the effect is visible also for the other lattices , but becomes less pronounced as the temporal extent is increased , i.e. , the temperature @xmath3 is lowered . in order to study this effect quantitatively",
    ", we fit the finite temperature results to the continuum form ( [ contresult ] ) plus two terms even in @xmath0 which parameterize the cutoff effects observed in fig",
    "the fit function is given by @xmath64 due to ( [ contresult ] ) the coefficient of the quadratic term should scale with the temperature such that one expects @xmath65 the coefficient for the quartic term should be constant , @xmath66 the results of the fit for the data used in fig .  2 , and for the largest lattice of fig .",
    "1 are given in table 1 .    .",
    "results of the fits to the form ( [ fitform ] ) .",
    "the spatial volume is always @xmath67 .",
    "the temporal extension @xmath68 is given in the first column .",
    "in the second column we list the corresponding value of @xmath69 which is what one expects for the fitting coefficient @xmath70 in the third column .",
    "the coefficient @xmath71 in the fourth column is expected to approach the constant value @xmath72 . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      as a function of @xmath0 ( in lattice units ) .",
    "we compare the results for overlap to those from wilson fermions.,width=321 ]    the table shows that with increasing @xmath68 the two physically significant parameters @xmath70 and @xmath71 approach the values expected from the continuum formula ( [ contresult ] ) : @xmath70 gets closer to @xmath69 as listed in the second column , and @xmath71 approaches @xmath72 . for the largest finite temperature lattice @xmath73 the discrepancy is down to 9 % for @xmath70 , and 2 % for @xmath71 . the larger discrepancy for small @xmath68 can be understood as a discretization effect , since the temporal lattice spacing @xmath8 is related to the temporal extension through @xmath74 and thus larger @xmath68 implies a smaller @xmath8 . for comparison",
    "we also display the fit results for the @xmath75 lattice , which corresponds to zero temperature .",
    "there we find excellent agreement ( less than 1% discrepancy ) for the parameter @xmath71 , governing the leading term at @xmath76 .",
    "the overall picture obtained from the fit results is that overlap fermions with chemical potential reproduce very well both , the @xmath60 term , as well as the finite temperature contribution @xmath63 .",
    "we conclude that the analytic continuation of the sign function does not introduce lattice artifacts , such as the @xmath1 term known to be present in a naive implementation of the chemical potential .    in the final step of our analysis we study the discretization effect for larger values of @xmath0 and compare the results to the data from the standard wilson operator . in fig .",
    "3 we plot the ratio @xmath77 as a function of @xmath0 . in the continuum at @xmath76",
    "this ratio has the value @xmath72 indicated by the horizontal line . for small @xmath0 , up to about @xmath78 ,",
    "the wilson and overlap data fall on top of each other .",
    "for very small @xmath0 both operators show a prominent increase which is a left - over finite temperature effect , which for the ratio @xmath77 shows up as a @xmath79 term . in the range between @xmath80 and 0.5 the data are close to the continuum value . beyond 0.5",
    "the discretization effects kick in and the overlap and wilson results start to differ .",
    "a comparison with the equivalent plot in @xcite , where the results from various other lattice dirac operators were presented , shows that the discretization effects of the overlap operator at large @xmath0 are comparable to other formulations .",
    "in this article we have analyzed the energy density of the overlap operator at finite chemical potential .",
    "following @xcite , the sign function in the overlap was implemented through the spectral theorem using the analytic continuation of the sign into the complex plane . the subtracted energy density @xmath59 was analyzed for finite and zero temperature lattices .",
    "fits of the data show that the expected continuum behavior is approached .",
    "no trace of unphysical @xmath1 terms was found .",
