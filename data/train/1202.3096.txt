    "furthermore , the built - in dipole moment of an indirect exciton allows control of exciton transport by voltage @xcite and light @xcite .",
    "the long lifetime , large transport distances , efficient cooling , and control of transport make indirect excitons a model system for studying transport of cold bosons in condensed matter materials .",

    "heating occurs due to the injection of high energy excitons , which then thermalize within the timescales much shorter than the cooling time associated with acoustic phonons @xcite .",

    "the model illustrates the sensitivity of the exciton temperature to the tuning of the laser .",
    "exciton cooling via scattering with acoustic phonons becomes less effective against the heating supplied by excitation with increasing excitation energy .",
    "since the intensity reduction in the center of the inner ring is due to a higher exciton temperature in the region of laser excitation , the contrast of the inner ring @xmath18 gives a measure of the exciton heating .",
    "figure 3 shows that tuning the laser excitation to the hh dx resonance @xmath12 = 1.570  ev both maximizes the light absorption and minimizes the laser - induced heating of excitons , thus facilitating the realization of a cold and dense exciton gas .",
    "there is a qualitative agreement between the observed and simulated shapes of emission profiles ( see fig .",
    "2d - f and fig .",
    "the simulated ring contrast @xmath18 increases with excess energy @xmath56 ( fig .",
    "4d ) , and therefore with excitation energy , due to increasing exciton temperature in the excitation spot ( fig .",
    "an increase of the ring contrast with excitation energy is in qualitative agreement with experimental data ( see fig . 3c and fig .",
    "note however that the simulations are based on a simplified qualitative model , which includes only exciton relaxation via emission and absorption of acoustic phonons and only one energy band - the band of hh indirect excitons .",
    "such model qualitatively explains the main observed characteristics of the inner ring , including the enhancement of the ring contrast with excitation energy , reported in this paper .",
    "a quantitative comparison with the experiment requires a theory which takes into account exciton relaxation via emission and absorption of optical phonons as well as hh and lh bands of direct and indirect excitons .",
    "the development of such theory forms the subject for a future work .",
    "we studied the excitation energy dependence of the inner ring in the indirect exciton emission pattern .",
    "such ring forms due to exciton transport and cooling .",
    "we found that the excitation - induced heating of the exciton gas is suppressed at lower excitation energies , reaching a minimum at the excitation energy tuned to the heavy hole direct exciton resonance , below which the inner ring disappears due to the diminished light absorption in the structure .",
    "we found that tuning the excitation laser to the heavy hole direct exciton energy both increases the density of indirect excitons and effectively suppresses the laser - induced heating of indirect excitons , thus facilitating the realization of a cold and dense exciton gas .",
