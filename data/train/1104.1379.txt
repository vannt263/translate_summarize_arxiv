    "a single impurity @xmath1-atom immersed in a background of @xmath2-fermions is a screened fermi polaron @xcite below a critical interaction strength . for larger interaction",
    "the ground state changes its character and the impurity forms a molecular bound state with the bath atoms .",
    "this qualitative change marks the polaron - to - molecule transition and was predicted by prokofev and svistunov @xcite .",
    "the transition can be regarded as the modification of the two - body problem due to medium effects : for two non - relativistic particles with an interaction characterized by the @xmath3-wave scattering length @xmath4 , a weakly bound molecule is the ground state for positive @xmath4 , whereas for negative @xmath4 the molecular state ceases to exist and the ground state is given by the free atoms .",

    "a mobile but very heavy impurity loses its quasi - particle character in low dimensions @xmath5 , related to the orthogonality catastrophe @xcite .",
    "the transition of the light mobile impurity poses a new and challenging many - body problem .",
    "the polaron - to - molecule transition is observable with ultracold atoms where the scattering length can be tuned via feshbach resonances @xcite . using radio - frequency ( rf )",
    "spectroscopy the lineshape , ground - state energy , and polaron quasi - particle weight have been measured across the transition @xcite .",
    "the ground - state properties near the transition have been calculated using variational wave - functions @xcite , non - self - consistent t - matrix approximations @xcite , @xmath6 expansions @xcite , wilsonian renormalization group @xcite , variational monte carlo @xcite and diagrammatic monte carlo ( diagmc ) @xcite .",
    "it turns out that even beyond the critical interaction strength the polaron remains as a long - lived excitation above the molecular ground state , and conversely the molecule becomes an excited state on the polaronic side of the transition . the proper description of these excited states and",
    "in particular their finite lifetime remains a difficult problem . using a phenomenological model in a three - loop calculation , bruun and massignan",
    "have shown that the decay rates of the excited states decrease rapidly as @xmath7 toward the transition , where @xmath8 is the energy difference between the ground and excited states @xcite .",
    "recently , interest has focused on an additional feature present in the polaron - to - molecule transition : the renormalization of the @xmath1-spectral function by the strong interactions leads to the appearance of an additional quasi - particle excitation for positive energies .",
    "this excitation corresponds to a fermi polaron interacting repulsively with the @xmath2-fermi sea .",
    "the repulsive polaron has a finite lifetime which becomes very small at unitarity , @xmath9 . in the opposite limit of weak coupling @xmath10 ,",
    "the repulsive polaron is long - lived and its spectral weight approaches unity .",
    "this justifies perturbative methods which neglect the presence of the molecular channel @xcite .",
    "the repulsive polaron has been studied theoretically in the context of ultracold gases by cui and zhai @xcite and more recently by massignan and bruun @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the repulsive polaron has not yet been observed in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "however , it has important implications for the stability of a ferromagnetic phase in fermi gases @xcite .",
    "furthermore , a single @xmath1-fermion in an @xmath2-fermi sea corresponds to a strongly imbalanced , two - component fermi gas near full polarization , and the polaron - to - molecule transition sheds light on a region of the zero - temperature phase diagram of the polarized fermi gas @xcite .",
    "so far , there is a lack of theoretical work which describes all of these features within one unified approach . in this paper",
    "we present a method capable of doing this : using a novel numerical implementation of the functional renormalization group ( frg ) we are able to determine both the full spectral functions and the quasi - particle features of the polaron - to - molecule transition .    with the renormalization group one",
    "usually limits oneself to a few running couplings . in this work",
    "we develop a computational tool which allows us to keep track of the renormalization group flow of fully momentum and frequency dependent matsubara green s functions based on an exact renormalization group equation @xcite . by introducing an auxiliary bosonic field which mediates the interaction between @xmath2- and @xmath1-atoms , we are able to accurately capture the momentum and frequency dependence of both vertex functions and propagators",
    ". in particular for non - universal quantities our approach , which complements the proposal by blaizot , mndez - galain , and wschebor @xcite , may prove vital , and we demonstrate its efficiency in the polaron problem .",

    "we give the spectral functions of the @xmath1-fermion and  for the first time  also of the molecule in a wide range of interaction values . from this",
    "we extract the quasi - particle properties including energies , decay rates and residues for both the polaron and the molecule .",
    "we connect the quasi - particle weight of the molecule with a measure of its compositeness introduced by weinberg @xcite .",
    "we propose a new experimental procedure to measure the repulsive polaron in a @xmath0li fermi gas using rf - spectroscopy , and we employ our spectral functions to predict the expected rf - response .    the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : frg ] we introduce the model of the polaron - to - molecule transition and derive appropriate frg flow equations .",
    "these equations are solved in section [ sec : solution ] for the full frequency and momentum dependent spectral functions , which are presented and interpreted in section  [ sec : spectrum ] .",

    "this will enable us to capture decay rates and dynamic effects which is not possible in a simple gradient expansion .",
    "within the truncation the yukawa coupling @xmath25 is not renormalized which can be seen by a simple argument : in eq .",
    "we neglect a term @xmath49 which would be regenerated during the flow by particle - hole fluctuations @xcite .",
    "similarly , a term @xmath50 for the atom - dimer interaction is neglected .",
    "both terms would lead to a renormalization of @xmath25 . due to their omission",
    ", however , there is no diagram generating a flow of @xmath25 which is why @xmath51 and @xmath25 remains independent of frequency and momentum .",

    "furthermore , the initial condition for the fermions is given by their form in the microscopic action , @xmath70 .",
    "as we will see in the following , the momentum and frequency dependence of both propagators , @xmath47 and @xmath46 , is strongly renormalized during the frg flow toward the infrared , which leads to a rich structure of the spectral functions .",
    "after inserting the truncation into the flow equation , the flow of @xmath46 and @xmath47 is derived by taking the appropriate functional derivatives of eq .   with respect to the fields .",

    "this value of the chemical potential @xmath86 then marks the phase transition from a degenerate , fully polarized @xmath2-fermi gas to a phase of finite @xmath1-fermion density @xcite .",
    "accordingly , for all choices of @xmath90 there has to be a vanishing occupation of both @xmath1-fermions and molecules at every rg scale @xmath34 , which leads to the condition @xmath91",

    "such a calculation requires the regulator @xmath96 in eq .   to be adjusted in order to cope with the finite fermi surface of @xmath1-fermions which complicates the computation .",
    "fortunately , our calculation for the polaron problem shows that for negative scattering length , where the polaron is the ground state and decay processes do not matter , the frg results are in excellent agreement with the results from a non - self - consistent t - matrix approach .",

    "the down chemical potential @xmath86 is determined in the way discussed in section  [ sec : frg ] .",
    "we find that the polaron is indeed the ground state for interaction strengths @xmath157 whereas the molecule becomes the ground state for @xmath158 , with @xmath159 .",
    "the energy spectrum from the simple derivative expansion is in qualitative agreement and even in rough quantitative agreement with the results obtained from our new numerical method and other theoretical calculations .",
    "a drawback of the derivative expansion is that it is impossible to extract a reasonable spectral function from an ansatz of the form as it only accounts for a single coherent quasi - particle excitation .",
    "neither higher excited states , such as the repulsive polaron , nor the incoherent background , which comprises the major weight for the molecule ( cf.section  [ sec : spectrum ] ) , can be captured with this ansatz .",
    "furthermore , although decay processes lead to a finite lifetime of the excited polaron and molecule branches , in the simple approximation these states have a vanishing decay width .",
    "note that the finite lifetime of excited states can be obtained neither from simple variational wave functions @xcite nor from the non - self - consistent t - matrix approach @xcite .",
    "their description requires the full self - energy feedback developed in section  [ sec : solution ] .",
