    "the motivation for the present work stems from the success of studying newtonian kepler / coulomb ( kc ) 2-body systems in velocity space .",
    "this method was originally presented by hamilton in 1847 @xcite , and elaborated years later mainly by maxwell @xcite and feynmann @xcite .",
    "it discusses the dynamics of the system by following the orbit traced by the tip of the velocity vector ( termed _ hodograph _ by hamilton ) . although hardly known , the virtue of the hodograph method is that its application to classical systems with @xmath0 potential provides , in a very simple and elegant way , the full solution  all the necessary information regarding the dynamics of the system , including spatial trajectories  just from the discussion in velocity space .",
    "its merits have been discusses on several occasions in the last decades @xcite .",
    "the success of the hodograph method with the newtonian kc systems triggers an interest in its possible application to relativistic systems .",
    "the simplest extension of newtonian kc systems to relativity are relativistic coulomb systems  the limit of em 2-body systems when one of the charges is much heavier than the other .",
    "such systems were studied in the literature ( @xcite and references therein ) , generally following standard methods in configuration space .",
    "the present work complements these studies , with a thorough discussion in relativistic velocity space .",
    "the essentials of the hodograph method are presented in the following .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that the hodograph method , newtonian and relativistic alike , is not a study in hamiltonian phase space @xmath2 , but an analysis confined only to the velocities , making use of the rotational symmetry of the system and the associated angular - momentum conservation to transform spatial dependencies to velocity dependencies .",
    "the use of rotational symmetry in this way is certainly an essential part of the method .",
    "also it is to be noted that the relativistic velocity space is a 3-d hyperboloid @xmath1 embedded in a 1 + 3 pseudo - euclidean space @xcite ( unlike the 3-d euclidean velocity space for newtonian systems ) , and the results depend heavily on this property .",
    "the talk started with reviewing the classical kc hodograph method ( see section [ sec : hodkc ] ) , followed with an account of the relativistic velocity space , the relativistic hodograph equations and general properties of the hodographs in section [ sec : hodrelc ] .",
    "the main body of the talk then consists of an illustrative account of the various particular cases .",
    "a fuller account of the results is in preparation to be published elsewhere .",

    "events in minkowski space - time are @xmath4 , with metric tensor @xmath5 . for any 4-vectors @xmath6 and @xmath7 , their inner product is then @xmath8 .",
    "classical kc systems are determined by the hamiltonian @xmath9 with the velocity equation of motion and the conserved angular momentum @xmath10 coordinates @xmath11 are assumed the for the plane of motion , with the conserved angular momentum vector @xmath12 perpendicular to it .",
    "polar coordinates @xmath13 are also used , with the polar - planar unit vectors @xmath14 satisfying @xmath15 eliminating the time variable from both equations in yields the velocity - angular equation @xmath16 with the general hodograph solution @xmath17 the constant of integration @xmath18 is known as _",

    "the minimal energy hodograph , with @xmath24 , is a canonical circle @xmath25 drawn by the tips of the vectors @xmath26 centred at the origin of velocity space ( ) , corresponding to circular spatial motion . with increasing",
    "energy @xmath18 becomes non - zero , the corresponding hodographs remain circles with the same radius @xmath27 but shifted from the origin of velocity space by @xmath18 ( & [ fig:3 ] ) , and the spatial orbits become conic sections .",
    "in particular , for unbound systems the hodographs reduce the infinite spatial trajectory into a finite circular arc ( ) .",
    "the endpoints correspond to @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is tangent to the hodograph .",
    "the interested reader may find more details regarding the hodograph method in classical systems in several publications @xcite .",
    "we use for the variables of the relativistic velocity space unit velocity ( time - like future - directed ) 4-vectors @xmath30 , all satisfying @xmath31 .",
    "the relativistic velocity space is then the space of all unit velocity 4-vectors , namely the 3-d unit hyperboloid ( @xmath1 ) @xcite @xmath32 embedded in a 4-d pseudo - euclidian space @xmath33 relativistic coulomb systems are determined by the hamiltonian @xmath34 the hodograph equations that follow from hamilton s equations may be formulated for all @xmath35 : @xmath36 and may be combined lorentz - covariantly as @xmath37 with the 4-d rotation matrix @xmath38 since @xmath39 , it follows that for any two solutions @xmath40 of in @xmath41 the inner product @xmath42 is constant .",
    "in particular , any solution of the hodograph equations in @xmath41 is of constant magnitude .",
    "the hodograph equations induce pseudo - rotation in @xmath41 , relative to an axis that itself rotates with @xmath43 .",
    "the axis of rotation is identified as being along the vector @xmath44 it is easily verified that the vector is preserved by . the fact that the classical basic circle @xmath45 is the spatial component of @xmath46 is very significant and will be discussed in the following .",
    "the hodographs of relativistic coulomb systems are the solutions of that are confined to @xmath47 .",
    "the confinement is insured by the constant norm of the solution .",
    "such general solutions , depending on the total energy @xmath48 and angular momentum @xmath49 as parameters , are denoted in the following @xmath50 .",
    "the principal significance of the axis vector is then in determining the energy integral , and thus the energy dependence of the hodograph : @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , so the energy is the ( constant ) projection of the kinematical momentum @xmath53 on the rotation axis .",
    "it is fairly straight - forward to obtain the general energy dependence of the hodographs .",
    "consider the infinitesimal variation between two hodographs whose energy differ by @xmath54 , @xmath55 the constraints @xmath56 and @xmath57 imply that @xmath58 with @xmath59 the vector @xmath60 is a space - like 4-vector , being orthogonal to @xmath61 and tangent to @xmath62 at @xmath61 , therefore @xmath63 . integrating as a 1st order ode in @xmath48 then yields the generic form of the hodographs , @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 is an energy - independent solution of the hodograph equation ( whose explicit form , depending on @xmath67 , will be given in the following ) , and also linearly independent of @xmath46 .",
    "equation demonstrates @xmath50 as the linear combination of an on - axis component @xmath68 and an off - axis component @xmath69 both have constant magnitudes but changing directions . being both solutions of the hodograph equation , they also maintain constant relative angle .",
    "the combined motion is therefore epicyclic , or precession  a rotation ( @xmath70 ) imposed on another rotation ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "@xmath71 will be recognized in the following as the _ relativistic hamilton vector_.    once the hodograph solution @xmath50 is available , it is also straight - forward to obtain the corresponding spatial trajectory . in simile to , from the definition of the conserved angular momentum @xmath72 then follows @xmath73 in return , since @xmath74 , the requirement that @xmath75 must be non - negative , @xmath76 , with equality possible only for unbound configurations at @xmath77 , determines the possible @xmath43-range .",

    "the relativistic requirement that particles velocities can not reach the velocity of light necessarily implies that the relativistic solution can have non - relativistic limit only for time - like @xmath46 .",

    "all these illustrations share a common colour code : the axes with red , blue and green arrowhead correspond , respectively , to @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 ( the @xmath86 axis suppressed ) ; the thick red line is the hodograph itself ; the blue circle is the basis circle @xmath87 ; brown is the colour for the vector @xmath68 and the circle @xmath88 it draws ; the orange line is a cross - section of the velocity space hyperboloid @xmath89 in the @xmath90 plane ; and the black line is the hamilton vector in each case .",

    "the purpose of the talk was mainly to present the application of the generally non - familiar _ hodograph method _  studying the dynamics of a system in velocity space  as it applies to a charged relativistic particle in coulomb field .",
    "the hodograph method has the merit that when applied to systems with @xmath0 potentials , newtonian and relativistic alike , the velocity equations are simply linear , providing a very straight - forward and elegant means to analyze the dynamics of the system .",
    "the newtonian kepler / coulomb ( kc ) hodograph is always a circle , in general displaced from the origin of velocity space , with a constant displacement that depends on the energy state and determines the shape of the ( conic section ) spatial trajectory . for relativistic coulomb systems",
    "this structure is preserved , in principle  a basic circle associated with the minimum energy state , uniformly displaced depending on the actual energy state .",
    "the unique relativistic feature is that the displacement is itself rotating , so the whole phenomenon is of rotation superimposed on rotation ",
    "precession on the velocity hyperboloid  thus the title with  back to epicycles \" .",
    "results of the analysis were presented in the form of an excursion in the garden of the many possible manifestations of the system , mostly in an illustrative way .",
    "explicit distinction was made between the cases which have a non - relativistic limit and others which are exclusively relativistic , demonstrating the particular characteristics of each .",
    "this analysis , whose details will be published elsewhere , is sought to assist attempts to advance the solution of the relativistic em 2-body problem : unlike the newtonian case , the relativistic ( non - quantum ) em 2-body problem does nt have , despite all the years , a satisfactory solution .",
    "some simple particular solutions have been found , mainly in the 60 s and the 70 s @xcite , but since then no real advancement has been marked and a general solution is missing .    however , as is well known , the @xmath0 interaction allows newtonian kc systems to enjoy a very special and simple form of the laplace - runge - lenz ( lrl ) symmetry , which is also directly associated with the spatial trajectories being conic sections @xcite .",
    "the combination of rotational symmetry with the extra lrl symmetry provides the full solution for these systems in configuration space .",
    "the application of the hodograph method to newtonian kc systems , providing the full solution in velocity space , may be demonstrated to be equivalent with the application of the lrl symmetry in ordinary space . in particular , the vector displacing the basic hodograph circle in velocity space , the hamilton vector , is a constant vector directly related to the constant lrl vector in the same system @xcite .",
    "the hodograph method therefore displays what may be termed _",
    "hamilton s symmetry _",
    ", complementary to the lrl symmetry .",
    "these symmetries are mathematically equivalent , but physically they behave differently : the lrl symmetry transforms between states of same energy but different internal angular momentum , while the hamilton symmetry transforms between states of same angular momentum while changing the energy .",
    "the success of using the extra symmetries with newtonian kc systems gives rise to the hope that by studying the corresponding extra symmetries in relativistic em systems a general solution may be advanced .",
    "it is in this context that the present work has been performed .",
    "newtonian kc 2-body systems may be reduced to 1-body systems by transition to the centre - of - mass ( cm ) reference frame .",
    "such a simple and direct procedure is impossible , in general , for relativistic 2-body systems because the interaction is not instantaneous .",
    "it is therefore convenient to start with coulomb systems , which may be regarded as the limit of em 2-body systems when one of the charges is much heavier than the other . the lrl symmetry in relativistic coulomb systems was already studied to some extent in recent years @xcite .",
    "here we considered the other face of these internal symmetries  the relativistic hamilton symmetry  demonstrating its usefulness for coulomb systems .",
    "in futuristic view , an answer to the question _ how may non - instantaneous interactions be handled on velocity space , especially in view of the fact that time does nt appear in the structure of the velocity space ? _ may provide a key to the whole issue of the 2-body em problem .",
    "it is hoped to come back to such questions soon .",
