    "the study of free shear layers and their instabilities is one of the oldest problems in fluid dynamics , dating back to the pioneering work of kelvin @xcite and helmholtz @xcite . in this work",
    "we will consider two types of shear layer , the magnetically induced shercliffe layer and the rotationally induced stewartson layer , that can easily be set up in a differentially rotating spherical shell .",
    "previous work has studied each of these layers and its corresponding instabilities in isolation @xcite .",
    "the basic shear layers are similar in many ways , but their instabilities may be very different .",
    "here we compare and contrast the two problems , and then consider the mixed case , when both magnetic and rotational effects are present .",
    "previous studies on magnetohydrodynamic spherical couette flow have included analytic @xcite , numerical @xcite and experimental @xcite work , with a variety of imposed magnetic fields .",
    "nonmagnetic stewartson layers have also been widely studied , in both cylindrical @xcite and spherical @xcite geometries .",
    "we start with two concentric spheres , of radii @xmath0 and @xmath1 , rotating about a common axis ( the @xmath2 axis ) with angular velocities @xmath3 and @xmath4 . the fluid filling the shell is taken to be electrically conducting , and a magnetic field @xmath5 is externally imposed .",
    "the question then is , what sort of flow states will result as the parameters @xmath6 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are varied , and can the solutions be classified in some systematic way , for example according to whether they are magnetically or rotationally dominated ?    in the reference frame rotating with the outer sphere , the governing equations are @xmath7 @xmath8 @xmath9 where the hartmann number @xmath10 measures the strength of the imposed magnetic field , the taylor number @xmath11 measures the overall rotation of the whole system , and the reynolds number @xmath12 measures the differential rotation of the inner sphere .",
    "the density @xmath13 , viscosity @xmath14 , diffusitivy @xmath15 , and permeability @xmath16 are ( constant ) material properties of the fluid .    in these equations ,",
    "length has been scaled by @xmath0 , time by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 by @xmath19 .",
    "finally , the induced magnetic field @xmath20 has been scaled by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the magnetic reynolds number , and eqs .",
    "( 1 ) and ( 2 ) have been formulated in the @xmath23 limit , in which @xmath24 no longer appears in the equations at all , but only in the interpretation associated with @xmath20 .",
    "see also @xcite ; the problem considered here is precisely the extension of @xcite to include the overall rotation given by @xmath25 .",
    "the boundary conditions associated with ( 1 ) are the usual spherical couette flow conditions @xmath26 where the radii will be fixed at @xmath27 and @xmath28 . for",
    "the boundary conditions associated with ( 2 ) we take the exterior regions @xmath29 and @xmath30 to be insulating .",
    "as shown in @xcite , taking these regions to be conducting instead can have dramatic consequences , yielding a counter - rotating jet rather than a shear layer .",
    "however , precisely because we want to focus on shear layers here , we consider only the insulating case .",
    "these equations and associated boundary conditions are solved numerically , using the spherical harmonics code @xcite .",
    "we begin by considering the axisymmetric basic states , then we linearize about these solutions , and compute the linear onset of non - axisymmetric instabilities . resolutions as high as 300 legendre functions in @xmath31 and 180 chebyshev polynomials in @xmath32 were used , and results were tested to ensure that all aspects of the solutions were fully resolved .",
    "figure 1 shows the solutions at @xmath33 , and @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , corresponding to an infinitesimal differential rotation , no overall rotation , and an increasingly strong magnetic field .",
    "we see the emergence of an increasingly thin shear layer , the shercliffe layer , located on the so - called tangent cylinder @xmath37 , the cylinder just touching the inner sphere and parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the origin of this layer is easy to understand , in terms of the magnetic tension along the field lines .",
    "fluid columns outside @xmath37 are coupled at both endpoints to the outer boundary only , so they remain at rest . in contrast ,",
    "fluid columns inside @xmath37 are coupled to both boundaries , which are rotating at different angular velocities , 0 at the outer boundary , and 1 at the inner boundary , as imposed by ( 6 ) .",
    "these columns then rotate at a rate intermediate between 0 and 1 .",
    "the result is a jump in angular velocity across @xmath37 , which is precisely the shercliffe layer observed in figure 1 .",
    "( inside @xmath37 there are also hartmann layers at the outer and inner boundaries , accomodating the jump from @xmath38 in the interior to 0 and 1 at the boundaries",
    ". we will not be interested in these boundary layers though . )",
    "figure 2 shows the solutions at @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "we again see the emergence of an increasingly thin shear layer , the stewartson layer , on the same tangent cylinder @xmath37 as before .",
    "the origin of this layer is also very similar to that of the shercliffe layer , the only difference being that now it is the taylor - proudman theorem that couples fluid columns along the @xmath2 axis , and not magnetic tension , which is of course entirely absent for @xmath43 .    despite their similarities , there are also important differences between shercliffe and stewartson layers .",
    "note for example how the contour lines in the stewartson layer are almost perfectly parallel , whereas in the shercliffe layer they spread out somewhat away from the inner sphere .",
    "related to this is the fact that the asymptotics of these two shear layers are also slightly different ; the shercliffe layer consists of a single layer of thickness @xmath44 @xcite , whereas the stewartson layer consists of a primary layer of thickness @xmath45 across which the shear is resolved , but also contains secondary layers of thicknesses @xmath46 just inside @xmath37 and @xmath47 just outside @xmath37 @xcite .    , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath48 for all three .",
    "]    , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath49 for all three . ]",
    "the results in figs .",
    "1 and 2 are all for the case of infinitesimally small differential rotation , @xmath50 .",
    "now suppose the differential rotation is gradually increased .",
    "as the shear across the layers is increased , one might expect the layers to become unstable eventually , to something like a kelvin - helmholtz instability .",
    "that is , one might expect the initially circular , axisymmetric basic state to adopt a wavy , non - axisymmetric structure .",
    "the instabilities of the pure shercliffe layer were considered by @xcite ; the left panel in fig .",
    "3 shows their results ( fig .",
    "4a in @xcite ) , over the range of hartmann numbers shown in fig .  1",
    ". the instabilities of the pure stewartson layer were considered by @xcite ; the right panel in fig",
    ".  3 shows these results ( fig .  4 in @xcite ) , again over the range of taylor numbers shown in fig .  2 .",
    "( note though that the equations here are scaled differently from those in @xcite , to allow for the possibility of @xmath51 here .",
    "the ekman and rossby numbers in @xcite are related to the taylor and reynolds numbers used here by @xmath52 and @xmath53 . )     as a function of @xmath54 for the pure shercliffe layer ; ( b ) shows @xmath55 as a function of @xmath56 for the pure stewartson layer .",
    "the numbers beside individual curves indicate the azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath57 , showing only the most unstable modes . in ( b ) , the solid curves @xmath58 to @xmath59 are for @xmath60 , whereas the dashed curve @xmath61 is for @xmath62 . ]    comparing the two panels in fig .  3 , there are clearly similarities between the two cases . most obviously , for comparable thicknesses of the underlying shear layers ( as indicated in figs .  1 and 2 ) the critical reynolds numbers for the onset of instabilities are also comparable , with @xmath63 for the @xmath64 and @xmath25 ranges shown . beyond that ,",
    "in both cases the critical reynolds numbers increase as the thickness of the shear layers decreases .    however , there is also one crucial difference between the instabilities of these two types of shear layer , more fundamental than any difference between the shear layers themselves .",
    "specifically , for the pure shercliffe layer , the results are invariant to the sign of @xmath65 , that is , the direction in which the inner sphere rotates . the easiest way to see this is to note that reversing the rotation of the inner sphere is equivalent to turning the entire system upside down .",
    "this merely reverses the sign of the imposed magnetic field though , which clearly has no effect .    in sharp contrast , the results for the stewartson layer are not invariant to the sign of @xmath65 .",
    "one can of course still imagine turning the system upside down , but instead of reversing the magnetic field , this now reverses the sense of the overall rotation . and unlike the magnetic field ,",
    "whose sign does nt matter , the sign of the overall rotation does matter . that is , instead of reversing the sign of @xmath65 one could just as well reverse the sign of @xmath25 , but the result is still not equivalent to the original configuration . having @xmath65 and @xmath25 of the same sign",
    "is fundamentally different from having them of the opposite sign .",
    "returning to the right panel in fig .  3 then , we note that @xmath60 and @xmath62 do indeed yield strikingly different instabilities .",
    "positive @xmath65 has increasingly large azimuthal wavenumbers @xmath57 for increasingly large @xmath25 , exactly as one would expect for a kelvin - helmholtz type instability , whereas negative @xmath65 has @xmath61 over the entire range of @xmath25 shown here .",
    "comparing with the @xmath66 invariant shercliffe results in the left panel , we see that these are more like the @xmath60 stewartson results , in that they also show a progression to higher @xmath57 .",
    "one reason for considering the mixed shercliffe - stewartson problem then is simply to see how this @xmath66 asymmetry manifests itself in this case , and at what point the results are more like the symmetric shercliffe problem or more like the asymmetric stewartson problem .",
    ", @xmath67 , and @xmath51 .",
    "the left panel shows the angular velocity , with a contour interval of 1/9 ; the middle panel shows the meridional circulation , with a contour interval of @xmath68 ; the right panel shows the azimuthally integrated kinetic energy of the instability , having wavenumber @xmath58 , as indicated in the left panel of fig .  3 .",
    "]    , @xmath69 , and @xmath43 .",
    "the left panel shows the angular velocity , with a contour interval of 1/9 ; the middle panel shows the meridional circulation , with a contour interval of @xmath70 ; the right panel shows the azimuthally integrated kinetic energy of the instability , having wavenumber @xmath71 , as indicated in the right panel of fig .",
    "first though we consider a few more aspects of the two pure problems , namely the spatial location of the instabilities .",
    "4 shows the shercliffe case , fig .  5 the @xmath60 stewartson case .",
    "the first panels in each figure show the angular velocity , as before in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "one point to note here is how similar these solutions at non - zero @xmath65 are to the @xmath50 solutions in figs .  1 and 2 .",
    "the inertial term @xmath72 is crucially important in driving the instabilities , but in the basic states themselves it is almost completely balanced by the pressure - gradient term .",
    "the second panels show the associated meridional circulation .",
    "this is very weak though in comparison with the shear layers , and does not appear to play an important role in the instabilities . finally , the grey - shading in the third panels shows the azimuthally integrated kinetic energy of the instabilities , that is , the quantity @xmath73 . as expected , both instabilities are concentrated on the tangent cylinder @xmath37 , although it is interesting to note that the concentration is far greater in the shercliffe case than in the stewartson case .",
    "figure 6 shows the corresponding results for the @xmath62 stewartson case , the anomalous @xmath61 mode .",
    "the instability now appears to have curious gaps in cylindrical radius , resulting in a striped appearance .",
    "furthermore , the instability reaches its maximum concentration not on @xmath37 , but instead just inside , where the stewartson layer intersects the ekman layer on the inner sphere .",
    "this would suggest that this anomalous mode is perhaps not a stewartson layer instability at all , but instead an ekman layer instability , for which it is well known that the @xmath60 case ( von krmn flow ) and the @xmath62 case ( bdewadt flow ) are indeed very different @xcite .    , and @xmath61 .",
    "]    , and @xmath61 . ]",
    "the numerical tests conducted by @xcite considered exactly this possibility , and suggest that however plausible this idea may be , it is incorrect : this @xmath62 mode is not a bdewadt instability , but a stewartson layer instability , just like the @xmath60 modes .",
    "however , these numerical tests @xcite , in which the meridional circulation and the ekman layers were simply deleted from the basic state before computing the instabilities , can be  and indeed have been  criticized as being unphysical , not corresponding to anything that one could actually set up in a lab , for example",
    ".    we would therefore like to repeat something like this deletion of the meridional circulation and the ekman layers , but in a way that is physical , and could be set up in an experiment .",
    "fortunately , this can be accomplished rather easily : we simply replace the outer boundary condition @xmath74 by @xmath75 at @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is 1 inside @xmath37 , and 0 outside ( for numerical reasons the transition is actually smoothed out over a degree or so ) .",
    "physically this would correspond to having the outer sphere split into differentially rotating segments , with the regions inside the tangent cylinder now co - rotating with the inner sphere , which is precisely how many stewartson layer experiments are indeed done @xcite .",
    "figure 7 shows these results . if we begin by comparing the basic states in figs .  6 and 7",
    ", we see that this new boundary condition has roughly doubled the jump in angular velocity across the shear , because everything inside @xmath37 is now co - rotating with the inner sphere , whereas before the fluid inside @xmath37 was rotating at a rate intermediate between 1 at the inner boundary and 0 at the outer . turning next to the ekman layers ,",
    "these have been largely eliminated ; if everything inside @xmath37 is co - rotating , there is simply no need for ekman layers at the boundaries . and correspondingly , the meridional circulation , which is driven by ekman pumping in the boundary layers , is also dramatically reduced .",
    "this new boundary condition has thus accomplished exactly what we wanted , but in a way that is physically realizable , unlike the numerical tests presented in @xcite . and if we compare the instabilities in the two cases then , the original boundary condition ( fig .  6 ) has @xmath61 and @xmath78 , and the new boundary condition ( fig .",
    "7 ) has @xmath61 and @xmath79 .",
    "that is , doubling the shear across the layer roughly halves the critical reynolds number , exactly as one would expect if it is indeed the shear layer that is triggering the instability .",
    "this new boundary condition therefore confirms the claim made by @xcite that this anomalous @xmath61 mode is also a stewartson layer instability ( although beyond that there are unfortunately still many aspects of this mode that are not entirely clear ) .",
    "figure 8 shows stability results for the mixed case , when neither @xmath64 nor @xmath25 are zero . starting with hartmann numbers @xmath80 and @xmath81 , @xmath25",
    "is increased from @xmath82 to @xmath81 , for both positive and negative @xmath65 . for @xmath83 , @xmath66",
    "are not surprisingly almost the same .",
    "as rotational effects become comparable with magnetic effects though , the rotationally induced asymmetry becomes more and more pronounced . for positive / negative @xmath65 the wavenumber increases / decreases , until for @xmath84 we are almost back to the pure stewartson regime , with large @xmath57 for positive @xmath65 , and small @xmath57 for negative @xmath65 .",
    "it is unfortunately not entirely clear why the wavenumbers behave in this way , but the fact that there is this smooth transition from the symmetric shercliffe case to the asymmetric stewartson cases , for both positive and negative @xmath65 , further reinforces the view that even these ` anomalous ' @xmath61 modes above are not so anomalous after all , but are merely the limiting case in this family of shear layer instabilities .",
    "one other interesting , and completely unexpected result in fig .",
    "8 is this initial decrease in the @xmath60 curves , reaching a minimum when @xmath85 .",
    "@xmath86 is of course precisely the regime where rotational and magnetic effects are comparable , so it is not surprising that any interaction between the two would manifest itself most strongly there .",
    "that rotational and magnetic effects can destabilize one another even though each separately has a stabilizing influence is also familiar in other contexts , such as rayleigh - bnard convection @xcite .",
    "it is not clear though why this mutual destabilization in this case does not occur for @xmath62 as well .    , with @xmath87 almost the pure shercliffe regime , and @xmath84 almost the pure stewartson regime .",
    "( a ) is for @xmath80 ; ( b ) is for @xmath88 . within each panel",
    "the upper set of curves , with decreasing wavenumbers , is for @xmath62 ; the lower set of curves , with increasing wavenumbers , is for @xmath60 . ]    finally , we wish to consider the spatial structures of both the basic states and the instabilities in this case @xmath89 where rotational and magnetic effects are interacting most strongly , and see whether they are more like the pure shercliffe case , or more like the pure stewartson case .",
    "figure 9 shows the results for @xmath60 ; comparing with figs .  4 and 5",
    ", we see that they look more like the pure shercliffe case .",
    "figure 10 shows the results for @xmath62 ; comparing with figs .  4 and 6",
    ", we see that the basic state again looks more like the pure shercliffe case .",
    "the instabilities though have aspects in common with both the stewartson case , namely this striped appearance , as well as the shercliffe case , namely the concentration more outside @xmath37 , rather than in the equatorial region as in the stewartson case .    , @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 , the bottom row at @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 ; that is , at the minima of the @xmath60 curves in fig .",
    "the left panels show the angular velocity , with a contour interval of 1/9 ; the middle panels show the meridional circulation , with a contour interval of @xmath70 ( top ) and @xmath97 ( bottom ) ; the right panels show the azimuthally integrated kinetic energy of the instabilities . ]    , with @xmath80 , @xmath98 , @xmath99 and @xmath100 for the top row , and @xmath88 , @xmath94 , @xmath101 and @xmath58 for the bottom row . ]",
    "in this work we have explored the stability of two types of free shear layers that may be set up by magnetic and rotational effects .",
    "although the shear layers themselves are very similar for the two effects , the instabilities are quite different in one important aspect , namely that in the magnetic shercliffe case they are invariant to the sign of the differential rotation that induces them , whereas in the rotational stewartson case they are not . however , as different as the @xmath66 pure stewartson cases may at first sight appear to be , by considering the mixed case , we showed that there is in fact a smooth progression from the invariant shercliffe limit to both of the @xmath66 stewartson cases , suggesting that these cases are not so different after all .",
