    "further , all possible ranges do occur , which is a characteristic shared statistically by a totally random lattice .",
    "in contrast , the aperiodic lattices of fibonacci , pd or tm type , which are generated by asymmetric inflation rules , are characterized by invariant , few - point spacing maps , with simple scaling laws along an ordered sequence of symmetry ranges .",
    "we have examined the local symmetry distribution ( positions of locally symmetric domains as a function of their range ) and dynamics ( spatial evolution of the distances between local symmetry axes for given range ) of one - dimensional aperiodic lattices generated by representative binary sequences , including ( generalized ) fibonacci , period - doubling , thue - morse and cantor . for each case , explicit scaling behaviors and correlation properties were found numerically for the sequences of occurring maximal local symmetry ranges , and for their spacings along the lattice , in relation to the original generating inflation rules or recursive schemes .    in particular , the generalized fibonacci lattices were shown to incorporate multiplet symmetry range subsequences with different structural features determined by the asymptotic length ratio of the corresponding binary word generations , with a dominant subsequence containing all complete local symmetries ( i.e. , palindromic word prefixes ) . moreover , for the fibonacci , pd and tm lattices , the number of different local symmetry spacings is restricted to @xmath212 or @xmath238 for any symmetry range . in terms of the subsequences of local symmetry spacing return maps for given ranges ,",
    "the ( asymptotic ) copper fibonacci lattice was shown to be structurally equivalent to the period - doubling lattice , of which in turn the thue - morse case constitutes a reduced version ( with two sub - subsequences discarded ) .",
    "remarkably , the aperiodic order of each type of lattice was found to be encoded exactly in its local symmetry dynamics : for each occurring local symmetry range , the renormalized sequence of axis spacings is generated by the inflation rule of the original aperiodic sequence .",
    "the local symmetry distribution of the above lattices was , finally , contrasted with the cantor lattice , whose inflation rule is inherently palindromic with gapped maximal symmetry distribution and unbounded symmetry spacing return maps .    in conclusion , we have shown that a unified view of different classes of aperiodic lattices is provided by the distribution , and , in particular , by the fixed range spacing dynamics , of their ( maximal ) local symmetries .",
    "they yield a compellingly simple analysis tool to distinguish structural similarities but also lower level differences between given lattices .",
    "the encoding of the corresponding inflation rule within any given symmetry spacing trajectory further demonstrates that local symmetries completely characterize deterministic aperiodic order at any scale .",
    "since we perform a numerical investigation of the considered aperiodic sequences , throughout the paper the notion of asymptotic convergence is not used in a mathematically strict sense , but refers to the observed behavior for large number of corresponding iterations .",
    "the first and second range subsequences would be @xmath333 and @xmath334 , respectively .",
    "thus , in order to consider the very _ first _",
    "@xmath196-tet bundle @xmath335 , one has to include , apart from the single - letter maximal palindromes with length @xmath173 , also the _ empty _ maximal palindromes @xmath7 of length @xmath336 .",
    "the latter are the interfaces between two different letters @xmath21 and @xmath22 in a word .",
    "since @xmath337 and @xmath115 are not plotted throughout our analysis , we describe the @xmath196-tets starting from the second bundle @xmath338 ."
