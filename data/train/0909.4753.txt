    "early extragalactic source ( e.g.r.s ) rotation measure ( rm ) probes of the milky way magnetic field by gardner & davies , ( 1966 ) , and the first pulsar rm analyses by manchester ( 1972 , 1974 ) revealed a prevailing magnetic field in the local spiral arm that is clock - wise as viewed from the north galactic pole ( ngp ) .",
    "further study with a 555-source extragalactic rm dataset produced the discovery of a large scale field reversal in the sagittarius - carina arm ( simard - normandin & kronberg , 1979 ) , indicating a global bisymmetric field geometry .",
    "subsequent numerical analyses by simard - normandin & kronberg ( 1980 ) confirmed a prevailing local field pointing to @xmath4 , a more complex pattern in the north galactic hemisphere ( ngh ) , an anomalously high off - plane , high rm zone ( `` region a '' ) , a @xmath5 angular autocorrelation scale of rm s off the plane , and a galactic magneto - ionic scale height of @xmath6 1.8 kpc .",
    "confirmation of a large scale ( bisymmetric ) pattern has since come from several e.g.r.s and pulsar rm studies rand & lyne , 1994 ; han _ et al .",
    "_ , 1999 ; frick _ et al .",
    "_ , 2001 & weisberg _ et al .",
    "variants of this model have been proposed by han _",
    "_ , 2006 @xmath7 a bisymmetric model with field reversals at each arm / interarm interface , valle ( 2008 ) @xmath7 a concentric ring model having one field reversal , and sun _ et al . _",
    "( 2008 )  a 3d - model combined with observations , concluding that a combined axisymmetric and toroidal model best describes the galactic magnetic field .",
    "et al . _ , ( 2008 ) , using pulsar rm s , concluded that neither a concentric ring model nor the bi - symmetric or axi - symmetric field models alone , will suffice when attempting to describe the galactic magnetic field .    the high density of e.g.r.s .",
    "rm s in the @xmath8 canadian galactic plane survey ( cgps ) ( brown , taylor , & jackel 2003 ) , and in the @xmath9 southern galactic plane survey ( sgps ) ( brown _ et al . _ , 2007 ) were recently used to probe both small - scale ( haverkorn _ et al .",
    "_ , 2006 ) , and large - scale field structures ( brown _ et al .",
    "_ , 2007 ) .",
    "the best fit model of the latter has a clockwise field everywhere except for two reversals , one in the scutum - crux arm and the other in the molecular ring at a smaller galactocentric radius of @xmath10 3.7 kpc .",
    "this contrasts with a pulsar - rm analysis by han _",
    "et al . _ , ( 2006 ) , which concluded multiple field reversal zones in the galactic disk . in the current paper",
    "we present an all - sky plot investigation of the milky way s smoothed rm pattern .",
    "we use a new 2257-rm compilation of @xmath11 1500 revised and more accurate e.g.r.s .",
    "rm s of our own , combined with the recently published cgps / sgps rm s , and two smaller published lists from ( klein _ et al .",

    "combination with the cgps and sgps rm surveys enables us to explore the match between the `` in - plane '' and `` off - plane '' rm sky . to an extent",
    "not seen before , we find better defined , and remarkably coherent patterns of rm sign over the inner @xmath12 of galactic longitude of the milky way disk .",
    "figure 1 shows an equal area , all - sky projection of the smoothed rm s . the rm smoothing used the method of simard - normandin & kronberg ( 1980 ) , in which an iterative calculation of the mean rm was performed at each ( @xmath1,@xmath3 ) , using all neighbor source rms within a 15@xmath13 radius .",
    "the rm error was @xmath14 rad m@xmath15 for @xmath16 of our off - plane rm s , and @xmath17 rad m@xmath15 for @xmath18 of the same sample . at each iteration at a given source ( @xmath1,@xmath3 ) , rm values @xmath19 1.3@xmath20 were eliminated as `` outliers '' , and a minimum of 4 rm s was required to define a smoothed rm value at that ( @xmath1,@xmath3 ) .",
    "we tested varying `` cutoff @xmath20 s '' for the optimum iterative removal of rm outliers .",
    "the criterion was to minimize , at high @xmath21 , the distribution width of galaxy - corrected rms around 0 rad m@xmath15 .",
    "we re - confirmed the 1.3@xmath20 value determined in simard - normandin & kronberg ( 1980 ) .    in the galactic plane from @xmath22 to @xmath23",
    "( figure 1 ) only one major sign reversal occurs , at @xmath24 310@xmath13 . an apparent contradiction to additional rm reversals on smaller scales by brown _",
    "( 2007 ) is purely an effect of our smoothing half - width , @xmath25 , which averages over ( real ) smaller scale rm reversals .",
    "this also applies to other zones near @xmath3 = 0@xmath13 , and at some higher latitudes ( figure 1 ) . in doing so , it more faithfully reveals major , _ large _ scale rm features near the milky way disk , which is the subject of this letter .",
    "publication of the entire rm set and comparisons with higher latitude features is in preparation ( newton - mcgee , _ et al .",
    "_ , in preparation ( 2010 ) ) .",
    "the following analysis focuses on @xmath26 , and uses the rm data at our smoothing resolution .",
    "some large scale patterns and symmetries not previously apparent become clearer at this rm resolution , as we show in the following section .",
    "the smoothed , latitude - averaged rm s at @xmath27 are shown in figure 2(a ) .",
    "the rm s in the two @xmath1-semicircles are first folded about @xmath28 .",
    "when we then reverse the rm signs in one semi - circle ( figure 2(b ) ) a clear symmetrical / anti - symmetrical pattern emerges in the rm s . specifically , the _ forms _ of the smoothed / averaged rm s are strikingly similar but they have opposite signs on opposite sides of the galactic center .",
    "now , having folded about @xmath1 = 0@xmath13 it is obvious that @xmath1 = 0@xmath13 is not the correct symmetry axis : an 11@xmath13 relative shift of the folded datasets needs to be applied @xmath7_i.e .",
    "_ fold , invert sign , _ and _ shift . for optimum determination of this shift ,",
    "we restricted the rm s to within @xmath29 to @xmath30 of the post - shift folding center .",
    "figure 2(c ) shows the remarkably good overlap that results .",
    "this shift corresponds to a pointing of the prevailing local b - field to @xmath31 , _",
    "i.e. _ inward from the @xmath32 tangential .",
    "independently , the same @xmath33 rotation applies to rm s at nearly all latitudes in the outer galaxy from @xmath3 @xmath34 to @xmath3 = @xmath35 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "it agrees within errors to the less precise starlight polarization@xmath7derived field orientation ( heiles(1996 ) and references therein ) .",
    "more interestingly it agrees with the general spiral arm orientation , making the milky way similar in this respect to well - studied nearby galaxies such as m51 , m83 , and ng6946 .",
    "this , combined with the symmetries / antisymmetries seen in figure 2 indicates that an extragalactic observer would see a remarkably organized spiral structure in the milky way disk , with a pitch angle of 11@xmath13 in our region of the galaxy , and a prevailing disk field that is close to the general spiral arm direction .",
    "this resolves longstanding disagreements on the magnetic vs. general arm comparison .",
    "we confirm that the milky way behaves like other grand - design spiral galaxies in this respect .",
    "outward of @xmath1 @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) and of @xmath3860 @xmath13 ( @xmath39 ) , the galactic magnetic field has the same prevailing sign above , in , and below the galactic plane .",
    "this includes the `` in - plane '' rm regions of the cgps and sgps ( @xmath8 and @xmath40 , respectively ) . in",
    "virtually _ all _ @xmath1 ranges below the plane , the rm s keep the same prevailing sign right down to the south galactic pole .",
    "these results confirm that the `` _ outer galaxy _ '' rm s taken by themselves are consistent with a very clear axisymmetric global field pattern .",
    "_ inward _ of the above longitude boundaries ( @xmath6 280@xmath13 to @xmath6 60@xmath13 ) the prevailing rm signs in these same inner zones are opposite on either side of @xmath1 = 0@xmath13 ( figure 1 ) .",
    "there are three further noteworthy features : first , as @xmath3 approaches @xmath41 , the rm(@xmath3 ) reverses sign between @xmath42 and 100@xmath13 and between 300@xmath13 and @xmath43 , a slightly wider @xmath1 range ( about @xmath44 ) than for the reversal at @xmath45 .",
    "second , as @xmath21 increases above @xmath46 the sharp features and symmetries shown in fig .",
    "2 gradually become less distinct .",
    "third , when we repeat the procedure in fig . 2",
    "but accept only the rm s at very low latitudes ( @xmath8 ) , the best fit prevailing field direction is exactly the same as in fig .",
    "2 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "this shows that the large scale rm(@xmath1 ) variations in the plane are preserved up to at least @xmath47 .",
    "as @xmath21 increases above @xmath46 , as mentioned above , the sharpness and clear shape of the patterns in figure 2 begin to `` dissolve '' .",
    "we have discovered new and striking symmetries in the regular component of the galactic disk magnetic field using an expanded and revised compilation of 2257 e.g.r.s . rotation measures .",
    "this new clarity results from 3 factors : ( 1 ) the increased numbers of rm s in zones immediately in and around the galactic plane , ( 2 ) the smoothing scale that we have chosen filters out smaller scale ( though not insignificant ) sign reversals and other smaller scale galactic magnetic features .",
    "our analysis shows , in effect , that these have previously tended to `` mask '' the galaxy s true _ global _ galactic magnetic geometry . near the disk .",
    "finally , ( 3 ) our latest rm determinations have many more accurate rm s than were previously available .",
    "the rm variations in a 20@xmath13 band from @xmath48 to @xmath49 about @xmath1 = 0@xmath13 around the galactic plane show new clear and sharp reversals at our 20@xmath13 smoothing resolution .",
    "this rm smoothing favors , on average , longer galactic pathlengths .",
    "there is striking mirror symmetry about a reference direction 11@xmath50 from @xmath51 .",
    "this gives a precisely determined , @xmath1  =  79@xmath50 mean magnetic field direction near the sun @xmath7 similar , but more precisely determined than several earlier observations beginning with simard - normandin & kronberg s ( 1980 ) estimate of @xmath4 . in a 3-d representation",
    ", this spiral tilt appears to apply over the entire @xmath52 kpc @xmath53height of the milky way disk , at least in our broad galactic vicinity .",
    "similarly , the clear galactic magnetic symmetries we have presented(fig .",
    "2 ) appear to apply within the galactic disk scale height of @xmath54 kpc  a consensus of several analyses over the past 3 decades .",
    "the gradual `` softening '' of the rm(@xmath1 ) patterns at @xmath55 further suggests that these clear patterns are confined to within  1 - 2 kpc of the milky way s disk .",
    "other patterns emerge as the galactic @xmath56 height increases .    the improved definition of rm reversal zones are of particular interest for the propagation of charged ultra - high energy cosmic ray nuclei ( uhecr ) through our galaxy ( the pierre auger collaboration , 2007 ) . some of our field sign reversal boundaries may represent galactic zones where incoming ( extragalactic ) uhecr s could be minimally deflected in the galaxy s magnetic field .",
    "the large scale disk rm patterns described here are a key basis for defining the galactic 3-d magnetic structure . in turn",
    ", this will be crucial for interpreting the observed patterns of uhecr arrivals as a function of energy , charge and direction .",
