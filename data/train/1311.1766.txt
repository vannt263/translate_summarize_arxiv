    "the dynamics of nematic liquid crystals is an important object of study in both physics and engineering",
    ". many popular models of nematic liquid crystals consider a medium consisting of thin rods that are allowed to rotate about their center of mass but are not allowed to translate . under the assumption that the medium is not flowing and deformations only occur when the mean orientation of long molecules is changed , one can describe the the orientation of the molecules at each location @xmath0 and time @xmath1 using a field of unit vectors @xmath2 this field @xmath3 is termed as the _ director field_.    given a director field @xmath3 , the well - known oseen - frank potential energy density @xmath4 , associated with this field , is given by @xmath5 the positive constants @xmath6 and @xmath7 are elastic constants of the liquid crystal .",
    "note that each term on the right hand side of arises from different types of distortions .",
    "for instance , the term @xmath8 corresponds to the bending of the medium , the term @xmath9 corresponds to a type of deformation called splay , and the term @xmath10 corresponds to the twisting of the medium .",
    "for the special case of @xmath11 , the potential energy density reduces to @xmath12 which corresponds to the potential energy density used in harmonic maps into the sphere @xmath13 .",
    "the constrained elliptic system of equations for @xmath3 , derived from the potential using a variational principle , and the parabolic flow associated with it , are widely studied , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "however in the regime where inertial effects are dominant ( over the viscosity ) , it is more natural to model the propagation of orientation waves in the director field by employing the principle of least action @xcite i.e , @xmath14 again in the special case of @xmath11 , this variational principle yields the equation for harmonic wave maps from @xmath15-dimensional minkowski space into the two sphere , see @xcite and references therein .",
    "planar deformations are of great interest in the study of nematic liquid crystals . in particular , if we assume that the deformation depends on a single space variable @xmath16 and that the director field @xmath3 has a special form ( which means that the director field is in a plane containing the @xmath16 axis ) : @xmath17 here , the unknown @xmath18 measures the angle of the director field to the @xmath16-direction , and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the coordinate vectors in the @xmath16 and @xmath21 directions , respectively . in this case",
    ", the variational principle reduces to @xmath22 where @xmath23 $ ] with fixed @xmath24 , and the wave speed @xmath25 given by @xmath26 for some positive constants @xmath27 .",
    "the form is the standard form of the nonlinear variational wave equation considered in the literature .    if we consider the following _ energy _ :",
    "@xmath28 a simple calculation shows that smooth solutions of the variational wave equation _ conserve _ this energy i.e , they satisfy @xmath29      similarly , if the deformation depends on two space variables @xmath30 , the director field has the form : @xmath31 with @xmath32 being the angle to the @xmath33 plane .",
    "the corresponding wave equation is given by , @xmath34 where @xmath35 $ ] with @xmath24 fixed , @xmath36 is the unknown function and @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 for some constants @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "furthermore , smooth solutions of also _ conserve _ the following energy : @xmath41 i.e , smooth solutions satisfy with respect to the above energy .      it is well known that the solution of the initial value problem , even for the one - dimensional planar wave equation develops singularities in finite time , even if the initial data are smooth @xcite .",
    "hence , solutions of are defined in the sense of distributions , i.e. ,    set @xmath42 .",
    "a function @xmath43;w^{1,p}({\\mathbb{r}})\\right ) \\cap c({\\pi_t } ) , u_t      \\in l^{\\infty}\\left([0,t];l^{p}({\\mathbb{r}})\\right),\\ ] ] for all @xmath44 $ ] , where @xmath45 is some positive constant , is a weak solution of the initial value problem if it satisfies :    1 .   for all test functions @xmath46 [ def : w3 ] @xmath47 2 .",
    "@xmath48 in @xmath49;l^2({\\mathbb{r } } )      \\right)$ ] as @xmath50 .",
    "3 .   @xmath51 as a distribution in @xmath52 when @xmath50 .",
    "it is highly non - trivial to extend the solution after the appearance of singularities . in particular , the choice of this extension is not unique .",
    "two distinct types of solutions , the so - called _ conservative _ and _ dissipative _ solutions are known . to illustrate this difference",
    ", one considers initial data for which the solution vanishes identically at some specific ( finite ) time . at this point , at least two possibilities exist : to continue with the trivial zero solution , termed as the dissipative solution . as an alternative",
    ", one can show that there exists a nontrivial solution that appears as a natural continuation of the solution prior to the critical time .",
    "this solution is denoted the conservative solution as it preserves the total energy of the system .",
    "this dichotomy makes the question of well - posedness of the initial value problem very difficult .",
    "additional admissibility conditions are needed to select a physically relevant solution .",
    "the specification of such admissibility criteria is still open .",
    "although the problem of global existence and uniqueness of solutions to the cauchy problem of the nonlinear variational wave equation is still open , several recent papers have explored related questions or particular cases of .",
    "it has been demonstrated in @xcite that is rich in structural phenomena associated with weak solutions .",
    "in fact rewriting the highest derivatives of in conservative form @xmath53 we see that the strong precompactness in @xmath54 of the derivatives @xmath55 of a sequence of approximate solutions is essential in establishing the existence of a global weak solution .",
    "however , the equation shows the phenomenon of persistence of oscillations @xcite and annihilation in which a sequence of exact solutions with bounded energy can oscillate forever so that the sequence @xmath55 is not precompact in @xmath54 , but the weak limit of the sequence is still a weak solution .    there has been a number of papers concerning the existence of weak solutions of the cauchy problem , starting with the papers by zhang and zheng @xcite , bressan and zheng @xcite and holden _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors show existence of a global weak solution , using method of young measures , for initial data @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "the function @xmath58 is assumed to be smooth , bounded , positive with derivative that is non - negative and strictly positive on the initial data @xmath59 .",
    "this means that the analysis in @xcite does not directly apply to .",
    "a different approach to the study of was taken by bressan and zheng @xcite . here",
    ", they rewrote the equation in new variables such that the singularities disappeared .",
    "they show that for @xmath59 absolutely continuous with @xmath60 , the cauchy problem allows a global weak solution with the following properties : the solution @xmath32 is locally lipschitz continuous and the map @xmath61 is continuously differentiable with values in @xmath62 for @xmath63 .    in @xcite , holden and raynaud",
    "prove the existence of a global semigroup for conservative solutions of , allowing for concentration of energy density on sets of zero measure .",
    "furthermore they also allow for initial data @xmath64 that contain measures .",
    "the proof involves constructing the solution by introducing new variables related to the characteristics , leading to a characterization of singularities in the energy density .",
    "they also prove that energy can only focus on a set of times of zero measure or at points where @xmath65 vanishes .",
    "in contrast to the one - dimensional case , hardly any rigorous wellposedness or even qualitative results are available for the two - dimensional version of the variational wave equation .      given the nonlinear nature of the variational wave equations and , explicit solution formulas are hard to obtain .",
    "consequently , robust numerical schemes for approximating the variational wave equation , are very important in the study of nematic liquid crystals .",
    "however , there is a paucity of efficient numerical schemes for these equations . within the existing literature",
    ", we can refer to @xcite , where the authors present some numerical examples to illustrate their theory . in recent years",
    ", a semi - discrete finite difference scheme for approximating one - dimensional equation was considered in @xcite .",
    "the authors were even able to prove convergence of the numerical approximation , generated by their scheme , to the _ dissipative _ solutions of .",
    "however , the underlying assumptions on the wave speed @xmath58 ( positivity of the derivative of @xmath58 ) precludes consideration of realistic wave speeds given by .",
    "another recent paper dealing with numerical approximation of is @xcite . here",
    ", the authors use their analytical construction to define a numerical method that can approximate the _ conservative _ solution . however , the method is computationally very expensive as there is no time marching .    furthermore , there are some works on the ericksen",
    " leslie ( el ) equations @xcite ( essentially the simplest set of equations describing the motion of a nematic liquid crystal ) . in @xcite , authors have presented a finite element scheme for the el equations .",
    "their approximations are based on the ideas given in @xcite which utilizes the galerkin method with lagrange finite elements of order @xmath66 .",
    "convergence , even convergence to measure - valued solutions , of such schemes is an open problem . in @xcite ,",
    "a saddle - point formulation was used to construct finite element approximate solutions to the el equations .",
    "a penalty method based on well - known penalty formulation for el equations has been introduced in @xcite which uses the _ ginzburg  landau _ function .",
    "convergence of such approximate solutions , based on an energy method and a compactness result , towards measure valued solutions has been proved in @xcite .",
    "the above discussion clearly highlights the lack of robust and efficient numerical schemes to simulate the nonlinear variational wave equation .",
    "in particular , one needs a scheme that is both efficient , simple to implement and is able to approximate the solutions of accurately .",
    "furthermore , one can expect both _",
    "conservative _ as well as _ dissipative _ solutions of the variational wave equation , after singularity formation .",
    "hence , it is essential to design schemes that approximate these different types of solutions .    to this end",
    ", we will construct robust finite difference schemes for approximating the variational wave equation in both one and two space dimensions .",
    "the key design principle will be energy conservation ( dissipation ) . as pointed out before , smooth solutions of and are energy conservative .",
    "after singularity formation , either this energy is conserved or dissipated . we will design numerical schemes that imitate this energy principle .",
    "in other words , our schemes will either conserve a discrete form of the energy or dissipative it .",
    "hence , we construct both energy conservative schemes as well as energy dissipative schemes for the variational wave equation , in both one and two space dimensions .",
    "extensive numerical experiments are presented to illustrate that the energy conservative ( dissipative ) schemes converge to the conservative ( dissipative ) solution of the variational wave equation as the mesh is refined . to the best of our knowledge , these are the first finite difference schemes that can approximate the conservative solutions of the one - dimensional variational wave equation .",
    "furthermore , we present the first set of numerical schemes to approximate the two - dimensional version of these equations .",
    "our energy conservative ( dissipative ) schemes are based on either rewriting the wave equation as a first - order system of equations or using a hamiltonian formulation of our system .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : num ] , we present energy conservative and energy dissipative schemes for the one - dimensional equation . numerical experiments illustrating these schemes are presented in section [ sec : numex ] .",
    "the two - dimensional schemes are presented in section [ sec:2d ] .",
    "we begin by introducing some notation needed to define the finite difference schemes . throughout this paper , we reserve @xmath67 and @xmath68 to denote two small positive numbers that represent the spatial and temporal discretization parameters , respectively , of the numerical schemes . for @xmath69 , we set @xmath70 , and for @xmath71 , where @xmath72 for some fixed time horizon @xmath73 , we set @xmath74 . for any function",
    "@xmath75 admitting point values we write @xmath76 , and similarly for any function @xmath77 admitting point values we write @xmath78 .",
    "we also introduce the spatial and temporal grid cells @xmath79 furthermore we introduce the jump , and respectively , the average of any grid function @xmath80 across the interface @xmath81 @xmath82 the following identities are readily verified : @xmath83      it is easy to check that the variational wave equation can be rewritten as a first - order system by introducing the independent variables : @xmath84 then , for smooth solutions , equation is equivalent to the following system for @xmath85 , @xmath86 furthermore , the energy associated with the above equation is @xmath87 again , we can check that smooth solutions of preserve this energy .",
    "weak solutions can be either energy conservative or energy dissipative .",
    "our objective is to design a ( semi - discrete ) finite difference scheme such that the numerical approximations conserve a discrete version of the energy . to this end , we suggest the following finite difference scheme : @xmath89    the energy conservative property of this semi - discrete scheme is presented in the following theorem :    [ theo : cons ] let @xmath90 and @xmath91 be approximate solutions generated by the scheme .",
    "then @xmath92    we start by multiplying the first equation of by @xmath93 and second equation by @xmath94 respectively . using relations",
    ", we have @xmath95 which implies @xmath96 where @xmath97 next , multiplying by @xmath67 and summing over @xmath98 gives @xmath99 this proves the theorem .",
    "we expect the above designed energy conservative scheme to approximate a conservative solution of the underlying system . in order to be able to approximate a dissipative solution of",
    ", we propose the following modification of the energy conservative scheme :    @xmath100    where we have chosen @xmath101 i.e , the maximum local wave speed .",
    "we show that the above scheme dissipates energy in the following theorem :    [ theo : diss ] let @xmath90 and @xmath91 be approximate solutions generated by the scheme",
    ". then one can prove that @xmath102 with strict inequality if @xmath103 or @xmath104 is not constant .",
    "first note that @xmath105 are positive for all @xmath98 , since @xmath106 for all @xmath98 . emulating the calculations of previous theorem ,",
    "i.e. , first multiplying the first equation of by @xmath107 and second equation by @xmath108 respectively , and summing over all @xmath98 we have @xmath109 next , define @xmath110 then we have @xmath111 this proves the theorem .    hence , the scheme is energy stable ( dissipating ) and we expect it to converge to a dissipative solution of as the mesh is refined .",
    "we remark that energy dissipation results by adding _ numerical viscosity _ ( scaled by the maximum wave speed ) to the energy conservative scheme .",
    "we can also rewrite the one - dimensional variational wave equation as a first - order system of equations by introducing the riemann invariants : @xmath112 again , for smooth solutions , equation is equivalent to the following system in non - conservative form for @xmath113 , @xmath114 observe that one can also rewrite the equation in conservative form for @xmath113 , @xmath115 the corresponding energy associated with the system is @xmath116 a simple calculation shows that smooth solutions of satisfy the energy identity : @xmath117 hence , the fact that the total energy is conserved follows from integrating the above identity in space and assuming that the functions @xmath118 decay at infinity .",
    "we also propose the following energy conservative scheme based on the riemann invariant system : to @xmath120 we have the following theorem for the scheme :    let @xmath121 and @xmath122 be approximate solutions generated by the scheme",
    ". then @xmath123    proof of this theorem is very similar to theorem  [ theo : cons ] .",
    "we multiply @xmath124 to the first equation of , @xmath125 to the second equation of and add resulting equations .",
    "this yields , @xmath126 next , multiplying by @xmath67 and summing over all @xmath98 gives @xmath127 where @xmath128 this proves the theorem .      in - order to approximate dissipative solutions , we add some numerical viscosity to the energy conservative scheme to obtain , @xmath129 where we have chosen @xmath101 , i.e , the maximum local wave speed .",
    "we have the following theorem illustrating the energy dissipation associated with    let @xmath121 and @xmath122 be approximate solutions generated by the scheme .",
    "then , @xmath130 where the inequality is strict if @xmath131 or @xmath132 is not constant .",
    "the proof of this is similar to the proof of theorem  [ theo : diss ] and is therefore omitted .",
    "all the above schemes were designed by rewriting the variational wave equation as first - order systems and approximating these systems .",
    "however , one also design an energy conservative scheme by approximating the nonlinear wave equation directly . to this end .",
    "we write the nonlinear wave equation in the general form : @xmath133 with @xmath134 being a part of the `` hamiltonian '' , and @xmath135 being the variational derivative of function @xmath136 with respect to @xmath32 .    in general , it is easy to show that for @xmath137 in fact , this is a direct consequence of the fact that @xmath138 we also note that for equation , @xmath139    based on above observations , we propose the following scheme for @xmath140 where the central difference @xmath141 is defined by @xmath142    this scheme is energy preserving as shown in the following theorem :    let @xmath143 be approximate solution generated by the scheme .",
