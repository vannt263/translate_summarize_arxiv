    "over the last decade , astronomy has experienced a boom of panchromatic surveys of high redshift galaxies  such as the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ? * ) and the cosmic evolution survey ( cosmos , * ? ? ? * )  thanks to the developments of space telescopes , like _ hubble space telescope ( hst ) and _ spitzer space telescope ( @xmath3 ) , and also of ground - based facilities , including keck observatory , very large telescope ( vlt ) , and subaru telescope .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( seds ) constructed from the photometric data of wide wavelength coverage have been used to constrain galaxy parameters , such as stellar masses , sfrs , and stellar population ages , of high redshift galaxies via comparison with simple stellar population synthesis models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "accompanied byselection techniques to separate high - redshift galaxy samples efficiently via their broad - band colors and magnitudes , these surveys have provided increasing information about the nature of high - redshift galaxies . _ _    however , despite recent advances in our knowledge of the properties of high redshift galaxies , more accurate estimation of physical parameters is necessary for addressing several important issues in galaxy evolution and cosmology .",
    "for example , it is as yet uncertain whether the lyman break galaxies ( lbgs , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* )  high - redshift , star - forming galaxies selected according to their rest - frame ultraviolet ( uv ) colors  will evolve into large ellipticals @xcite , or into smaller spheroids , such as small ellipticals / spiral bulges or subgalactic structures , which will later be merged to form larger galaxies at @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "accurate knowledge of physical parameters , such as stellar masses and sfrs , serves as one of the important elements in discriminating among the possible evolutionary descendants of lbgs .",
    "also , accurately constraining lbg s stellar - population ages and stellar masses is necessary for determining how much the lbg populations contributed to cosmic reionization .",
    "better estimation of these parameters is also crucial in comparing different galaxy populations at different redshifts .",
    "the stellar populations of lbgs as well as other populations of high - redshift galaxies have been studied by several authors using sed - fitting methods to compare the photometric seds of observed galaxies with various galaxy spectra from stellar population synthesis models .",
    "@xcite investigated 33 spectroscopically - confirmed lbgs with a redshift range , @xmath5 .",
    "they found that the mean lower limit of stellar masses of these lbgs is @xmath6 @xmath7 with upper limits of @xmath2 3 - 8 times larger and that the mean age is @xmath2 120 myr ( assuming solar metallicity and @xcite imf ) with broad range between 30 myr and 1 gyr .",
    "more importantly , they concluded that the most robust parameter constrained through sed - fitting is stellar mass , while stellar population age and especially star formation rate ( sfr ) are only poorly constrained .",
    "also , they speculated that sed - fitting methods ( single - component fitting ) can only give lower limits to galaxies stellar masses because the results from the sed - fitting methods are largely driven by the light from the most massive , most recently formed stars .",
    "@xcite studied the physical parameters of 74 , @xmath8 3 lbgs with spectroscopic redshifts .",
    "they confirmed that among various physical parameters , stellar mass is the most tightly constrained , and that constraints on other parameters such as dust extinction and age are weak . with the assumption of solar metallicity and a salpeter imf , the median age ( defined as time since the onset of current star formation )",
    "was found to be @xmath9 320 myr with a large spread from several myr to more than 1 gyr .",
    "the median stellar mass was 1.2@xmath10 , which is higher than the @xcite value .",
    "however , the @xcite lbgs were generally brighter than lbgs in the @xcite sample .",
    "the two studies found similar stellar masses for lbgs with similar rest - frame uv luminosities .",
    "@xcite also found that about 20 @xmath11 of the lbgs have best - fit ages older than 1 gyr , stellar masses larger than @xmath12 , and sfr @xmath2 30 @xmath7 @xmath13 , and they interpreted these as galaxies which have formed their stars over a relatively long period in a quiescent manner .",
    "@xcite also noted that more luminous galaxies are dustier than less luminous ones and that younger galaxies are dustier and have higher sfr .",
    "more recently , @xcite studied 21 @xmath8 5 lbgs , six of which have confirmed spectroscopic redshifts and the remaining 15 of which have photometric redshifts .",
    "these lbgs were found to be moderately massive with median stellar mass @xmath2 @xmath14 @xmath7 , and to have high sfrs with a median of @xmath2 40 @xmath15 .",
    "they also found that the stellar mass estimates are the most robust of all derived properties .",
    "best - fit ages have a large spread with a median value @xmath2 25 myr , assuming a metallicity of one - fifth solar ( 0.2 @xmath16 ) and a salpeter imf .",
    "@xcite also compared their @xmath17 5 lbgs with @xcite s @xmath17 3 lbgs , assuming the same imf and metallicity ( i.e. solar metallicity and salpeter imf ) , and concluded that these two samples of lbgs with similar rest - frame uv luminosity are clearly different .",
    "specifically , @xmath8 5 lbgs are much younger ( @xmath18 100 myr ) and have lower stellar masses ( @xmath19 ) than @xmath8 3 lbgs .",
    "the fraction of young ( age @xmath20 100 myr ) galaxies is @xmath2 @xmath21 for @xmath17 5 lbgs while it is @xmath2 @xmath22 for @xmath23 3 lbgs .",
    "they also concluded that these @xmath8 5 lbgs are the likely progenitors of the spheroidal components of present - day massive galaxies , based on their high stellar mass surface densities .",
    "@xcite analysed 72 @xmath8 5 galaxies ( not just lbgs ) with photometric redshifts .",
    "they performed an sed - fitting analysis on a spectroscopically confirmed subset of 14 @xmath8 5 galaxies to derive best - fit stellar masses ranging between @xmath24 and @xmath25 @xmath7 , and ages from 1 myr to 1.1 gyr .",
    "three out of these 14 galaxies have stellar masses in excess of @xmath26 . using stellar mass estimates from both spectroscopically confirmed and candidate galaxies , they calculated a stellar mass density at @xmath8 5 of @xmath27 , which is much larger than the integration of the star formation rate density ( sfrd ) from @xmath8 10 to 5 .",
    "they attributed this discrepancy either to significant dust extinction or to undetected low - luminosity star - forming galaxies at z @xmath28 5 .",
    "@xcite studied the properties of 1088 massive lbgs whose best - fit stellar masses are larger than @xmath29 at @xmath8 3 .",
    "they derived stellar masses of these massive lbgs through sed - fitting with the assumption of a salpeter imf , and noted that lbgs which are detected in mid - infrared wavelength are the ones with large stellar mass and severe dust extinction among lbg population .",
    "the sed - fitting method is also used to constrain physical parameters for high - z lyman-@xmath30 emitting galaxies ( laes , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and for submillimetre galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite analysed @xmath31 laes through sed fitting and found their ages range from 1 myr to 200 myr ( assuming a constant star formation history ) , and stellar masses from @xmath32 @xmath7 .",
    "@xcite used sed fitting to study physical parameters of scuba ( submillimetre common - user bolometer array ) sources , finding an average stellar mass of @xmath33 .",
    "however , the estimated parameter values and implications derived from these values are prone to several sources of error including errors inherent in sed - fitting methods .",
    "it is unclear whether or not sed - fitting methods deliver biased estimates of parameters such as stellar mass , age , and sfr .",
    "it is also unclear how much worse the parameter estimates become if spectroscopic redshifts are unavailable and the photometric data must be used to constrain not only the star formation history , but also the redshift .",
    "the critical question is how far we can trust the physical parameters derived using mainly photometric data under the assumption of simple star - formation histories ( sfhs ) , when real galaxies are expected to have more complex formation / evolution histories with several possible episodes of star - formation .    in this paper",
    ", we address this issue by comparing the statistical distributions of intrinsic physical parameters of model lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) from semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation , with the estimates of those same parameters derived from stellar population synthesis models through the commonly used sed - fitting method .",
    "there have been several studies which tried to constrain the stellar populations of lbgs or of high - redshift galaxies by comparing them with predictions from theoretical models , such as semi - analytic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ) or cosmological hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "@xcite compared @xmath34 and @xmath35 observed lbgs with semi - analytic models to investigate possible scenarios for lbgs , and @xcite put constraints on the properties of @xmath35 lbgs through comparison of colors of observed lbgs and sams model lbgs . @xcite and @xcite used cosmological simulations to place constraints on properties of uv - selected , @xmath36 galaxies and @xmath37 lbgs .",
    "@xcite constructed a set of galaxy templates from hydrodynamical simulations and used them to place constraints on properties of 6 @xmath38 observed galaxies .",
    "our approach is distinct from these studies . here , instead of comparing model galaxies with observed ones ,",
    "we perform sed fitting on model galaxies , derive best - fit parameters , and compare them with the intrinsic values given in the model , trying to understand quantitatively as well as qualitatively the biases and uncertainties of sed - fitting methods in constraining the physical parameters of lbgs .    to accomplish this , we construct galaxy formation histories by combining @xmath0cdm hierarchical structure formation theory with semi - analytic treatments of gas cooling , star formation , supernova feedback , and galaxy mergers .",
    "then , using the stellar population synthesis models of bruzual @xmath39 charlot ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter bc03 ) , and a simple model for dust extinction , we derive the photometric properties of these model galaxies . after selecting lbgs through appropriate color criteria ,",
    "we compare the photometric spectral energy distributions ( seds ) in observed - frame optical ( hst / acs ) through mid - infrared ( @xmath3/irac ) passbands of these model lbgs with those of sed templates from stellar population synthesis model of bc03 using a @xmath40-minimization method . in this sed - fitting procedure ,",
    "a large multi - parameter space is explored to minimize any prior .",
    "each parameter  such as star - formation time scale , age , dust - extinction , and metallicity  in this parameter space spans a broad as well as physically realistic range .",
    "the distributions of physical parameters of these model lbgs derived from this sed - fitting method are compared with the input distributions of these parameters from the semi - analytic model .",
    "various parameters in the semi - analytic model are calibrated to reproduce the colors of observed lbgs in the southern field of the goods ( goods - s ) .",
    "the goods @xcite is a deep , multiwavelength survey which covers a combined area of @xmath41 @xmath42 in two fields  goods - n centered on the hubble deep field - north ( hdf - n ) , and goods - s centered on the chandra deep field - south ( cdf - s ) .",
    "the extensive wavelength coverage of the photometric data in the goods fields including hst / acs ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath3/irac ( @xmath44 ) is beneficial for the derivation of various physical parameters of galaxies including stellar mass , sfr , and age .",
    "deep observations ( reaching @xmath45 ) in the goods fields can probe the high redshift universe in a comprehensive and statistically meaningful manner .",

    "semi - analytic models ( sams ) of galaxy formation are embedded within the framework of a @xmath60cdm initial power spectrum and the theory of the growth and collapse of fluctuations through gravitational instability .",

    "the details of the model can be found in the above references , and here we briefly highlight the most important aspects of the model ( including some changes from the models described in the original papers ) .",
    "the semi - analytic model used in this work implements the method of @xcite to build merging histories of dark matter halos .",
    "after dark matter merging histories are constructed , the semi - analytic treatments for various physical processes , such as gas cooling , mergers , star formation ( both in a merger - induced burst mode and in a quiescent mode ) , supernovae feedback , chemical evolution , and dust extinction , are applied to realize predictions of the formation history of a statistical ensemble of galaxies .",
    "a newly formed dark matter halo ( residing at top of the tree ) contains pristine shock - heated hot gas at the virial temperature .",
    "when a halo collapses or undergoes a merger with a larger halo , the associated gas is assumed to be shock - heated to the virial temperature of the halo .",
    "this gas then radiates energy and consequently cools . for small halos at high redshift",
    ", cooling is limited by the accretion rate , since the amount of gas that can cool at any given time can not exceed the amount of hot gas contained within the halo s virial radius .",
    "once halos merge , the galaxies within them remain distinct for some time .",
    "the central galaxy of the largest progenitor halo is set as the central galaxy of the merged dark matter halo .",
    "all the other galaxies become satellites , which then fall in towards the central galaxy due to dynamical friction . unlike in @xcite ,",
    "collisions between satellite galaxies are neglected here .",
    "both quiescent and merger - driven modes of star formation are included in the model .",
    "we assume that every `` major '' galaxy - galaxy merger above a certain mass - ratio threshold ( 1:4 ) triggers a starburst , which converts 100 % of the available gas into stars in a tenth of a halo dynamical time .",
    "quiescent star formation is modeled with a kennicutt - like law , such that the star formation rate is proportional to the mass of cold gas in the disk divided by the dynamical time .",
    "we also scale the sfr by a power - law function of the galaxy circular velocity , such that star formation is less efficient in low - mass galaxies .",
    "this mimics the effect of a sf threshold , as implemented in more recent semi - analytic models ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . the total star formation rate of a galaxy is the sum of the burst and quiescent modes .",
    "supernova feedback is also modeled via a simple recipe , where the rate of reheating of cool gas by supernovae is proportional to the sfr times a power - law function of circular velocity , such that the reheating is more efficient in smaller mass galaxies .",
    "if the halo s virial velocity is less than a preset ejection threshold ( set to 100 @xmath57 @xmath58 in our model ) , then all of the reheated gas is ejected from the halo ; otherwise the reheated gas is placed in the hot gas reservoir within the halo .",
    "the gas and metals that are ejected from the halo are distributed outside of the halo with a continuation of the isothermal @xmath62 profile that we assumed inside the halo .",
    "this material falls in gradually as the virial radius of the halo increases due to the falling background density of the universe .",
    "chemical evolution is treated by assuming a constant mean mass of metals produced per mass of stars .",
    "the metals produced in and ejected from stars are first deposited into the surrounding cold gas , at which point they may be ejected from the disk and mixed with the hot halo gas .",
    "the metallicity of any newly formed stars is set to equal the metallicity of the ambient cold gas at the time of formation .    for each galaxy ,",
    "the sam predicts the two - dimensional distribution of the mass in stars of a given age and metallicity .",
    "we convolve this distribution with the ssp models of bc03 ( using the padova 1994 isochrones ) to create a synthetic sed .",
    "we adopted a @xcite imf with lower and upper mass cutoffs of @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "we then use the model of @xcite to account for the opacity of intervening hi in the intergalactic medium as a function of redshift , and convolve the seds with the response functions appropriate to the acs , isaac , irac , and mosaic photometric bands .",
    "dust extinction is treated assuming that the face - on optical depth in the v - band is @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are free parameters set as 1.2 and 0.3 , to match the observations in the goods - s .",
    "this choice is motivated by the observational results of @xcite .",
    "the dependence of the extinction on wavelength ( the attenuation curve ) is calculated using a calzetti attenuation curve @xcite .",
    "in summary , we use the semi - analytic models to build galaxies that have rich and varied star formation histories that are motivated by the hierarchical galaxy formation picture .",
    "star formation is bursty and episodic .",
    "stars have a distribution of metals consistent with the assumed star formation history , and the dust content is plausible .",
    "in contrast , the simple sed templates which we will use to @xmath68 these model galaxies have uniform metallicity and monotonically declining star formation rates .",
    "we created a suite of model runs by varying the uncertain model parameters controlling the burstiness of star formation and dust extinction .",
    "as stated in   [ model ] , the rest - frame uv - continuum and uv - optical colors of model lbgs from each semi - analytic model run were compared with the colors of lbgs observed in the goods - s field , and the best - fit model run was selected based on these comparisons . from this best - fit model run , a model galaxy catalog , which contains a total of 44281 galaxies within a redshift range 2.3 @xmath69 5.7 , has been constructed .",
    "this catalog carries the various physical parameters such as stellar mass and sfr , along with the ( dust - extinguished ) broad band photometry for several bandpasses used in the goods observations .",
    "the photometric data in this catalog are derived by combining the sam s star formation and enrichment histories with bc03 stellar population synthesis models , and including models for dust extinction and absorption by the igm , as described in   [ model ] .",
    "these photometric data are used to select high - redshift , star - forming galaxies through the lyman - break color selection technique . the lyman - break color selection technique  which uses the ` lyman - break ' feature at @xmath70 @xmath71 in galaxy spectra and",
    "the lyman-@xmath30 forest flux deficit between 912 @xmath71 and 1216 @xmath71 together with blue colors at longer rest - frame uv wavelengths to identify star - forming galaxies located at high redshift  has been shown to be an effective way to construct large samples of high - redshift , star - forming galaxies from optical photometric data sets @xcite .",

    "the criteria for u - dropouts are set ( 1 ) to select @xmath8 3 star - forming galaxies , ( 2 ) to effectively avoid contamination from foreground stars , and ( 3 ) to minimize the overlap with b - dropouts .",
    "these color criteria and additional magnitude cuts for the acs z - band ( @xmath83 ) and irac channel 1 or channel 2 ( @xmath84 or @xmath85 ) , which correspond to detection magnitude limits for each bands in goods - s , give samples of lbgs containing 2729 objects for u - dropouts with redshift range @xmath86 , 2638 objects for @xmath87-dropouts with @xmath88 , and 808 for @xmath89-dropouts with @xmath90 .",

    "whose sfrs are assumed to decrease exponentially with time , the star formation activity in semi - analytic model galaxies  and probably in real lbgs also ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )  is more episodic and complex .",

    "( 3 ) mean ages are underestimated for these galaxies in the subpopulation while they are overestimated for the majority of galaxies .",

    "a more detailed investigation of this subpopulation is given in section [ subpop ] .",
    "it should also be noted that figure [ bmgclrzfree ] indicates that there are actually ( at least ) two subpopulations whose behavior in the sed - fitting procedure are distinct from the majority of lbgs .    the offsets in stellar mass , sfr , and mean age show relatively clear dependencies on rest - frame uv - optical color .",

    "interestingly , stellar masses tend to be overestimated for galaxies that are blue in rest - frame uv - optical color . these are also the galaxies whose biases in sfr and mean age are largest , which suggests that the mass - overestimation and age - overestimation share the same origin .",

    "these correlations shed light on the origins of the biases found in sections [ statdist ] and [ bias ] .",

    "the tight correlation of relative mean age errors with intrinsic ages is not unexpected from the correlation between relative mean age errors and rest - frame uv - optical colors .",
    "this correlation and the one between relative mean age errors and intrinsic ssfrs are a strong indication that mean ages and/or ssfrs are the main cause of bias .",
    "the sense of bias is that the stellar population mean age overestimates are worse for galaxies with the youngest intrinsic ages and/or largest ssfrs ( i.e. galaxies whose current sf activity is strong compared with the past sf activity ) , as can be seen in figure [ subagessfr ] . in this figure , which shows the intrinsic mean ages ( y - axis ) and ssfrs ( x - axis ) of b - dropout galaxies , blue dots represent galaxies whose relative age errors are @xmath138 , i.e. galaxies with the smallest @xmath135 .",
    "green dots are for galaxies with @xmath139 , and large red dots are for galaxies with the largest @xmath135 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "this figure clearly shows that galaxies with very large age overestimates are relatively young galaxies with high ssfrs .",
    "the young mean ages and large ssfrs of these galaxies indicate that they have experienced a relatively high level of sf activity recently .",
    "the mismatch between the sfhs predicted by the semi - analytic galaxy formation model and the simple sed templates from the bc03 stellar population model is expected to be largest for galaxies with this type of sfh . in the bc03 templates ,",
    "sfrs are assumed to decrease exponentially , so the strongest sf activity always occurs at early times , which is nearly the opposite of the sfhs of these galaxies .",
    "this difference makes ages overestimated severely for these galaxies .",
    "figures [ sfhrdaglg ] and [ sfhrdagsm ] , which show sf activity as a function of lookback time for individual galaxies , support this speculation . figure [ sfhrdaglg ] shows the typical sfhs ( we will refer this type of sfh as ` type-2 ' from now on ) of galaxies whose age - overestimation is largest .",
    "the star formation histories of these galaxies are clearly distinct from the sfhs of galaxies whose age - overestimation is smallest .",
    "the typical sfhs of galaxies with the smallest age - overestimation are shown in figure [ sfhrdagsm ] ( ` type-1 ' sfhs from now on ) . in figure",
    "[ subagessfr ] , there is a dearth of galaxies with old age and high ssfr and galaxies with young age and small ssfr .",
    "very young galaxies with low ssfr would not pass our color selection criteria and/or magnitude limits or would not be detected in real galaxy samples .",
    "old galaxies with high ssfr , in contrast , would be probably detected . to have a high ssfr and an old mass - weighted stellar population age , galaxies would need to have had a very extreme sfh  for example , two strong , very short , widely separated bursts .      how does this age overestimation affect other derived physical parameters , such as stellar mass and sfr ?",
    "when the mean stellar age is overestimated , some portion of the galaxy s luminosity will be attributed to older stars , with consequently higher mass - to - light ratios , than would be the case for the true sfh .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the stellar mass .    in previous studies ,",
    "it has been suspected that the stellar masses of galaxies are underestimated through single - component sed - fitting , since light from the recent star formation can easily mask some portion of the older stellar population .",
    "this is confirmed through the experiments done with the composite bc03 templates in section [ test ] . as stated in section [ statdist ] , the mean values of stellar masses",
    "are underestimated by @xmath2 19 - 25 @xmath11 , which is in qualitative agreement with the arguments of previous studies .",
    "however , figures [ umgclrzfix]-[vmgclrzfix ] and [ uersamzfix]-[versamzfix ] show that the stellar mass is not always underestimated . for some galaxies with very small stellar masses and/or relatively young ages ,",
    "the stellar mass can be overestimated .",
    "these galaxies are the ones for which the age overestimation is large .",
    "we speculate that the stellar mass estimation of lbgs is affected by two different factors .",
    "one factor is the fact that the recent generation of star formation can dominate the broadband sed , leading to the underestimation of stellar mass .",
    "the other is the sfh difference between sam galaxies and bc03 templates .",
    "if the age is overestimated due to the sfh difference , the mass - to - light ratio is overestimated , which results in the stellar - mass overestimation .    in figures",
    "[ uersamzfix]-[versamzfix ] , it can be seen that the stellar masses are most likely underestimated for the galaxies with the oldest ages and/or smallest ssfrs , for which the age - underestimation is minimal .",
    "more clearly , ( a)-(c ) in figure [ errvserr ] show that the stellar masses are underestimated when the age estimation is nearly correct .",
    "this confirms that the stellar mass is underestimated in single - component sed - fitting when the effect of the other origin of bias  sfh difference between the sam galaxies and the bc03 templates  is minimal    in figure [ errvserr ] ( a)-(c ) , we can also see that the age discrepancies and the stellar - mass discrepancies are correlated .",
    "stellar masses tend to be underestimated for galaxies with the smallest @xmath135 , while they are overestimated for most galaxies with the largest @xmath135 .",
    "this supports the speculation that the age - overestimation ( due to the sfh mismatch between the sam galaxies and the bc03 templates ) causes the mass - overestimation through mass - to - light ratio overestimation .",
    "evidently , in the stellar mass estimation , two sources of bias are compensating with each other . while sfh differences between the sam galaxies and the bc03 templates tend to make stellar masses to be overestimated in sed - fitting , recent sf activity can easily mask older stellar population causing the stellar masses to be underestimated .",
    "the compensating effects of these two biases in the estimation of stellar mass explains why the stellar mass distributions are recovered better than other parameters through the sed - fitting , and also provides a clue as to why the stellar mass has turned out to be the most robust parameter in earlier studies based on the sed - fitting ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "let us now consider the sources of bias in the sfr estimates .",
    "first , when ages are overestimated , the sed fitting erroneously assigns some portion of the luminosity to older stars instead of stars that are just forming .",
    "figures ( d)-(f ) of figure [ errvserr ] show that the sfrs are most severely underestimated for galaxies with the largest @xmath135",
    ".    however , the sfr still tends to be underestimated even when the age estimates are nearly correct .",
    "even some of the most extreme underestimates can be found for galaxies whose sed - derived age is correct to within a factor of two .",
    "this indicates that there is another source of bias in the sfr estimation .",
    "interestingly , the correlation between the relative sfr error and the relative stellar mass error shown in ( g)-(i ) of figure [ errvserr ] reveal distinct behaviors of the upper envelopes in this correlation between galaxies with the positive relative stellar mass errors and galaxies with the negative errors , providing another indication that there are two sources of bias in the sfr estimation . for galaxies whose",
    "stellar masses are underestimated ",
    "i.e. galaxies whose age - overestimation is small due to the little sfh difference or galaxies with type-1 sfh  the sfr discrepancy is proportional to the stellar mass discrepancy . as stated in   [ sed ] , the sfr is calculated from the estimated stellar mass accumulated over 100 @xmath141 .",
    "thus , for galaxies with the smallest age discrepancy ( with the type-1 sfh ) , the underestimation of stellar mass results in the sfr underestimation .    however , unlike in the stellar mass estimation , both of these two origins of bias  the age - overestimation due to the sfh mismatch and the hidden old stellar population by the recent sf activity  cause the sfrs to be underestimated .",
    "this results in the overall underestimation of the sfr distributions and the large offsets in the mean sfrs .",
    "in addition to these two origins , the well - known ` age - extinction degeneracy ' leads to more significant sfr underestimation . for galaxies with large ( positive ) @xmath135 ,",
    "dust extinctions tend to be underestimated due to the ` age - extinction degeneracy ' .",
    "this further deflates estimated sfrs for these galaxies .    in summary , the main origins of biases in estimating physical parameters , such as stellar mass , sfr , and mean age , are : ( 1 ) the differences in the assumed sfhs in the sam galaxies and in the bc03 stellar population templates , ( 2 ) the effects of the recent sf activity hiding some portion of old generations of stellar population , and ( 3 ) the age - extinction degeneracy . in the stellar mass estimation , issues ( 1 ) and",

    "if galaxies have sufficiently young ages ( compared with the age of the universe at the redshifts where galaxies reside ) the mean ages are overestimated , as the best - fit @xmath97s to be much larger than the input @xmath97s to compensate the @xmath96 difference . however , for old galaxies whose input @xmath97s are compatible to the age of the universe at corresponding redshift , the direction of bias in the age estimation is that the mean ages are underestimated ( even though the best - fit @xmath97s are slightly larger than the input @xmath97s ) . instead , the dust extinctions are greatly overestimated , which makes the best - fit sfrs erroneously high ( up to two orders of magnitude ) .",
    "lastly , in the case ( 3 ) , the model galaxies have two clearly distinguished generations of star formation with @xmath97 = 0.1 @xmath39 1.0 gyr . both of the components are set to have @xmath96 = 0.2 gyr .",
    "when we try to derive the best - fit physical parameters of these two component model galaxies via the single - component sed - fitting , both the mean ages and stellar masses are underestimated , as the result of the older stellar population being at least partially ignored .",
    "the age underestimation is minimal ( @xmath2 10 @xmath11 ) for the toy model galaxies in which the young - to - old ratio is smallest ( i.e. @xmath182 component fraction @xmath2 0.1 ) .",
    "the age underestimation increases as the proportion of young component increases ( up to @xmath2 77 - 88 @xmath11 for the ones with @xmath182/@xmath183 @xmath2 1.0 ) .",
    "this implies the best - fit parameters tend to be determined by the stellar component whose fractional occupation is large .",
    "however , as the @xmath182 component fraction increases further to @xmath182/@xmath183 = 2.6 , the age underestimation decreases and becomes similar to that for the galaxies with @xmath182/@xmath183 = 0.52 , because the mean ages of these galaxies ( with @xmath182/@xmath183 = 2.6 ) are already small enough to be greatly underestimated .",
    "as stated in previous sections , the age underestimation propagates to the mass underestimation .",
    "the mass underestimation is minimal ( @xmath184 @xmath11 ) for the model galaxies with @xmath182/@xmath183 = 0.1 due to the lowest age underestimation , and for the ones with @xmath182/@xmath183 = 2.6 because they have the smallest portion of their mass in the @xmath183 component .",
    "this means the mass underestimation depends on two factors  the degree of age underestimation ( i.e. the amount of the mis - interpretation of the mass - to - light ratio ) and the fraction of stellar mass in the @xmath183 component",
    ". the mass underestimation for galaxies with @xmath182/@xmath183 = 0.26 , 0.52 , and 1.0 , is in the range 21 - 40 @xmath11 .",
    "the sfrs are underestimated by @xmath2 14 - 43 @xmath11 , and the discrepancy is larger for the galaxies with larger fractional mass in the @xmath183 component .",
    "this is because the best - fit parameters are affected by the @xmath183 component while the sfr contribution of the @xmath183 component is very small ( @xmath2 0.2 - 4 @xmath11 of the total sfr , depending on the mass fraction of the @xmath183 component ) .",
    "the best - fit @xmath96s are larger than the input ( i.e. 0.2 gyr ) , and the best - fit @xmath97s are larger than the input @xmath182 component ( i.e. 0.1 gyr ) due to the effects of the @xmath183 component , and this leads to lower sfrs .    in summary , if one tries to fit galaxy s sed with single - component sed - fitting when the real sfh has two episodes , the mean ages and the stellar masses are generally underestimated indicating the @xmath183 components are to some extent masked . and ,",
    "the sfrs are underestimated since the @xmath183 components with very little current sf activity pollute the seds .",
    "for galaxies with a roughly constant star - formation rate , the extinction - corrected uv luminosity is expected to provide a reasonably good estimate of the star - formation rate .",
    "this is fortunate , because often the only data available for high - redshift galaxies are a few photometric data points in the rest - frame uv .",
    "the relation between sfr and uv luminosity can be calibrated using spectral synthesis models , such as bc03 .",
    "@xcite notes that the calibrations differ over a range of @xmath185 dex , when converted to a common reference wavelength and imf , with most of the difference reflecting the use of different stellar libraries or different assumptions about the star - formation timescale .",
    "the calibrations usually assume constant or exponentially declining star - formation rates .",
    "it is interesting to see how well this technique works for the more varied star - formation histories of the semi - analytic models . in this case",
    ", we are using bc03 and the same imf for both the calibration and the sam galaxies , so the discrepancies in derived sfrs must be primarily due to the different star - formation histories .    here , we derive sfrs of sam b - dropout galaxies with the assumption that we do not know their redshifts , which is similar to the case when there is no spectroscopic redshift information for a color - selected lbg sample .",
    "the ( dust - uncorrected ) rest - frame uv ( @xmath186 ) luminosity of each sam b - dropout galaxy is calculated from the @xmath48 band flux as    @xmath187    assuming all b - dropouts are at @xmath188 .",
    "here , @xmath189 and @xmath190 are specific flux at @xmath48 band and specific luminosity at rest - frame 1500 @xmath71 , respectively , and @xmath191 is luminosity distance at redshift @xmath1 , which is assumed to be 4.0 .",
    "there are two major possible sources of systematic biases , which can arise due to the assumption that all galaxies are at @xmath188 : ( 1 ) ignoring the bolometric correction  which is a decreasing function of redshift and is small  a factor of @xmath192 in the redshift range of b - dropouts ( @xmath88 ) for @xcite imf and solar metallicity , and ( 2 ) ignoring error in luminosity distance ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "these two sources of bias act in opposite direction .",
    "not including bolometric correction causes the uv luminosity to be slightly overestimated at high redshift , since it is a decreasing function of redshift .",
    "underestimation of the luminosity distances for galaxies at high redshift ( @xmath193 ) leads to underestimated uv luminosities .",
    "the correction factor due to the error in @xmath194 estimation is slightly larger at high - redshift than the bolometric correction factor , and ranges from 0.8 to 1.4 in the redshift range of b - dropouts .",
    "together , this will cause rest - frame uv luminosity to be slightly underestimated at the high - redshift end of the range .",
    "for all b - dropout galaxies , dust - extinction is assumed to be @xmath195 , which is the same value used for dust - correction in high - redshift lbg studies , such as @xcite and @xcite .",
    "star - formation rates are then calculated using the conversion of @xcite divided by 2.0 to correct for the different assumed imf , because @xcite uses a @xcite imf with a mass range 0.1 to 100 @xmath196 .",
    "figure [ sfrfromuv ] shows the ratio of dust - corrected , uv - derived sfr to intrinsic sfr as a function of redshift . in this figure",
    ", we can see the redshift dependent behavior of the star - formation rate calibration from the rest - frame uv .",
    "this behavior is a combined effect of luminosity - distance underestimation , which is small , though , as explained above , and the redshift - dependent difference in average dust - extinction . the large scatter of sfr ratios at a given redshift reflects the variation of galaxies intrinsic dust - extinction and sfh .",
    "differences in dust extinction can have a large effect .",
    "for example , small change in assumed value of mean @xmath93 will significantly change the derived sfr values  for a range of @xmath93 from 0.10 to 0.20 , the dust - correction factor vary from 2.6 to 6.5 .    with the assumed dust - extinction of @xmath195 ,",
    "mean uv - derived sfr is 11.099 @xmath197 . for comparison ,",
    "mean values of intrinsic and sed - derived sfrs are 15.650 @xmath197 and 6.638 @xmath197 , respectively .",
    "figure [ uvsfrdst ] shows the distributions of intrinsic sfrs ( @xmath198 ) , and of sfrs derived by assuming all galaxies are at @xmath188 and assuming dust - extinction of @xmath195 ( @xmath199 ) .",
    "the distribution of sfrs derived from rest - frame uv luminosity , assuming all galaxies are at @xmath188 , is much narrower than the intrinsic one .",
    "we have shown in this paper that there are significant biases in the physical parameters derived from the sed - fitting of standard @xmath96-model to broadband photometry .",
    "biases are severe especially for the sfr and mean age , but even the sed - derived stellar masses are biased .",
    "we now address in some detail how the biases in the derivation of these physical parameters can affect the investigation of high-@xmath1 galaxies and the inferred galaxy evolution studies .",
    "figures [ sfrdstzfix ] and [ agedstzfix ] show that there are bimodalities in the sfrs and mean ages derived through the sed - fitting ( most clearly shown for b - dropout lbgs ) while there is no such bimodality in the intrinsic distributions .",
    "these bimodalities are enhanced when we try to fit the seds omitting some available input information , such as nir photometry from isaac or the spectroscopic redshift ( figures [ udropdsts ] , [ bdropdsts ] , and [ vdropdsts ] ) .",
    "the main origin of these artificial bimodalities is the mismatch of the sfhs between the sam model galaxies and the templates from the bc03 stellar population model as explained in ",
    "[ subpop ] .",
    "such bimodalities can lead to the false interpretation that there are clearly distinguished populations among the similarly selected star - forming galaxies .",
    "recently , @xcite analysed 14 lyman-@xmath30 emitting galaxies ( laes ) and found that there is a clear bimodality in their age distribution , which are derived through sed - fitting , such that their ages either very young ( @xmath20 15 myr ) or old ( @xmath200 450 myr ) .",
    "based on this bimodality , they concluded that there are two distinct populations of laes  dusty starbursts and evolved galaxies .",
    "however , according to the results presented in our work , it is possible that this age bimodality reported in @xcite may not be real but an artifact which arises in the sed - fitting procedure due to the difference of their sfhs .",
    "of course , caution should be applied in interpreting the sed - fitting results of the laes based on our analysis performed for the lbgs .",
    "it is still controversial how similar ( or how different ) the lbgs and laes are , despite some indications of similarities in their physical parameters @xcite and the possible overlap between lbgs and laes @xcite .",
    "@xcite also reported a subset of galaxies in their sample of @xmath36 , star - forming galaxies with extremely young ages ( with @xmath201 myr ) .",
    "the galaxies in this subpopulation are relatively less massive ( @xmath20log @xmath202@xmath200 = 9.64 ( calculated from column 7 in table 3 of @xcite ) , while the mean value of total sample is 10.32 .",
    "more dramatic difference between galaxies in this subset and other remaining galaxies is shown in the derived sfr distribution . among 72 galaxies ,",
    "there are 10 galaxies whose sfrs are larger than 200 @xmath7 @xmath13 , and among these 10 , nine galaxies belong to this subset of galaxies with @xmath201 myr according column 8 in their table 3 ( one remaining galaxy with high sfr has the best - fit @xmath203 myr ) . in contrast",
    ", almost half of their sample has very low sfrs ( @xmath204 @xmath13 ) . based on our analysis , it is plausible that the 10 galaxies with the very high sfrs have similar sfhs as shown in figure [ sfhrdagneg ] ( i.e. type-3 sfhs ) , and therefore their ages and stellar masses are underestimated while their sfrs are greatly overestimated .",
    "if so , the ages and sfrs of their total sample would present more continuous distributions .",
    "bimodalities in the inferred ages are also seen among @xmath205 lbgs of @xcite and among 14 , @xmath205 lbgs with spectroscopy of @xcite .    more interestingly , in the @xcite sample , there are three galaxies whose physical parameters derived through the sed - fitting methods do not agree with the indications from their rest - frame uv spectra .",
    "the sed - fitting results indicate that these are old ( @xmath206 @xmath207 1 ) galaxies with very low level of sfrs ( @xmath2 a few @xmath7 @xmath13 ) , while there are indications of a young population of stars with active star formation in there spectra ( see    4.5 in @xcite for detail ) .",
    "this apparent disagreement can be explained if these galaxies have the star formation histories similar with the ones shown in figure [ sfhrdaglg ] ( i.e. type-2 sfhs ) .",
    "there is great interest in connecting lbgs to their possible descendants ",
    "i.e. determining whether or not they are progenitors of local massive ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "many properties of lbgs  including their sizes , morphologies , number densities , clustering properties , and physical properties  are closely linked to this issue .",
    "therefore , more accurate estimation of lbgs physical parameters are clearly important for addressing this issue properly .    according to our analysis , the stellar masses derived using the single - component sed - fitting methods tend to underestimate the true values , on average , by 19 - 25 @xmath11 .",
    "moreover , bias in the stellar mass estimation seems to strongly depend on the stellar mass itself , in a sense that the stellar masses are more severely underestimated for more massive galaxies ( see figures [ uersamzfix ] , [ bersamzfix ] , and [ versamzfix ] ) .",
    "for some of very massive galaxies ( @xmath208 ) , the best - fit stellar masses can be less than half of the intrinsic stellar masses . accompanied by the sfr underestimation , which is generally more severe than the stellar mass underestimation , this discrepancy can significantly affect the discrimination among possible evolutionary descendants of massive lbgs .",
    "since the current ( or recent ) sfr is a measure of the possible additional stellar mass which can be added to lbgs during their evolution to the lower redshift , the underestimation of the stellar mass and sfr of massive lbgs can plausibly lower their possible stellar masses at lower redshift or at @xmath4 significantly .",
    "interestingly , studies based on the clustering properties of lbgs speculated that massive , high-@xmath1 lbgs could be the progenitors of local massive ellipticals ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while @xcite , based on the sed - fitting analysis , suggested that lbgs would not become sufficiently massive at low-@xmath1 to be massive ellipticals unless experience significant number of mergers .",
    "biases and uncertainties in the estimation of lbgs ages  which are shown not only to be large and but also to vary significantly as the fitting parameters change in our study  can also affect understanding of lbg properties and the predictions regarding their possible evolutionary paths .",
    "for example , biases in the age estimation would propagate into errors in their estimation of the star - formation duty cycle , which would , in turn , affect the estimates of the number of galaxies which have similar stellar masses / ages with detected lbgs , but are undetected due to their reduced sfrs .",
    "in this paper , we examine how well the widely - used sed - fitting method can recover the intrinsic distributions of physical parameters  stellar mass , sfr , and mean age  of high - redshift , star - forming galaxies . to this end",
    ", we construct model high - redshift galaxies from the semi - analytic models of galaxy formation , make a photometric catalog via the bc03 synthesis model , and select lbgs through the appropriate color selection criteria based on their broadband colors .",
    "then , we perform sed - fitting analysis , comparing the photometric seds of these model galaxies with various galaxy spectral templates from the bc03 stellar population model to derive the distributions of best - fit stellar masses , sfrs , and mean ages .",
    "we use this test to explore ( rather exhaustively ) the errors and biases that arise in such sed fitting and the underlying causes of these errors and biases .",
    "when we fix the redshift to the given value in the sam catalog and use @xmath109/@xmath110/@xmath111 passbands , the sed - fitting method reproduces relatively well the input distributions of stellar masses with a minor tendency to underestimate the stellar masses and with substantial scatter for individual galaxies .",
    "the mean stellar masses are underestimated by about 19@xmath225 @xmath11 , which is due to the fact that the old generations of stars can be hidden by the current generation of star formation .",
    "the distributions of sfrs and mean ages show larger offsets than the stellar mass distributions .",
    "the sfrs are systematically underestimated and the mean ages are systematically overestimated , and these trends mainly reflect the difference in the sfhs predicted by the semi - analytic models and assumed in the simple galaxy templates used in the sed fitting .",
    "the well - known ` age - extinction degeneracy ' plays an important role in biasing the derived sfrs .",
    "when we use redshift as an additional free parameter , the discrepancy between the intrinsic- and sed - derived stellar mass distributions increase ( i.e. , the overall stellar mass underestimation becomes worse ) , while the bimodalities which appear in the sfr @xmath39 mean age distributions become more significant .",
    "the distributions of offsets of individual galaxies indicate that there exist sub - population(s ) of lbgs whose behaviors are distinct from the majority of lbgs in the sed - fitting .",
    "the sed - fitting generally underestimates the redshift slightly .",
    "the age overestimates are clearly related to the intrinsic age and specific star formation rate of each galaxy .",
    "the overestimation of mean ages is worse for galaxies with younger ages and higher ssfrs .",
    "inspection of the sfhs of individual sam galaxy confirms that the main origin of the bias in the age estimation is the difference of assumed sfhs in sam galaxies and the simple galaxy templates used in the sed fitting .",
    "this bias in the age - estimation propagates into the stellar mass and sfr estimations , in the sense that the age - overestimation leads to the mass - overestimation and sfr - underestimation .",
    "the sfr - underestimation is further enhanced by the ` age - extinction degeneracy ' .",
    "another source of biases is the dominance of the current generation of star formation over the old generation(s ) of star formation in the sed - fitting .",
    "this causes both of the stellar masses and sfrs to be underestimated .",
    "we perform two types of two - component sed - fitting : ( 1 ) adding a young , bursty component to an old component with long - lasting sfh , and ( 2 ) combining an old , bursty component with a younger , long - lasting component . the changes of behaviors in these two types of two - component fitting depend on galaxies sfhs .",
    "generally , compared with the best - fit values in the single - component fitting , the best - fit stellar masses are generally smaller in the two - component fitting with a young , bursty component embedded in an older , long - lasting component , while they become larger in the two - component fitting with an old burst combined with a younger , long - lasting component . for the majority of galaxies ( mainly , with type-1/type-2 sfhs ) , the best - fit ages become younger and the best - fit sfrs become higher in both types of the two - component fitting .",
    "the behavior of galaxies with type-3 sfh is opposite : the best - fit ages are older and the best - fit sfrs are smaller than the values derived in the single - component fitting .",
    "we perform the sed - fitting with different combinations of passbands  by omitting @xmath111 data or @xmath110 data .",
    "if we fit the galaxy seds with @xmath109 and @xmath110 data only omitting @xmath111 data , the derived distributions of stellar masses , sfrs and mean ages are significantly affected .",
    "the detailed behaviors of change in the sed - fittings with and without irac data strongly depend on galaxy s redshift and sfh .",
    "alternatively , if we fit the seds of lbgs with @xmath109 and @xmath111 data only , the derived distributions of stellar masses , sfrs , and means age do not show significant changes except for the enhanced bimodalities in the sfr / age distributions for b-/v - dropouts .",
    "this indicates that the significant changes occur only for a small fraction of galaxies , while the effects of @xmath110 data in the sed - fitting are insignificant for the majority of lbgs .",
    "these experiments demonstrate the usefulness of the observed - frame mir data from @xmath111 in constraining physical properties of the high-@xmath1 , star - forming galaxies .",
    "\\6 . when the allowed range of @xmath96 ( star formation @xmath95-folding timescale ) is limited to be insufficiently short or long , biases in the sed - fitting increase , in general , compared with the case when sufficiently broad range of @xmath96 is allowed ( from 0.2 gyr to 15.0 gyr in this study ) .",
    "the mean values of the best - fit stellar mass and age are smaller than the values derived with the full range of @xmath96 used .",
    "the age shifts are larger when we limit @xmath96 to be small ( @xmath92 1.0 gyr ) than when we use very large value of @xmath96 (= 15.0 gyr ) .",
    "detailed behaviors of change for individual galaxy depend on the sfh .",
    "the experiments with the sed templates constructed from the bc03 model (   [ test ] ) isolate the effect of limiting the allowed range of @xmath96 .",
    "if @xmath96 is restricted to be @xmath209 gyr , both the stellar mass and mean age are underestimated while the sfr is overestimated .",
    "if only very long values of @xmath96 are used , the stellar mass is overestimated for the majority of model galaxies ( from bc03 model ) as a result of the mis - assignment of light to older stars ( with consequently higher mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "the biases in the sfr and age estimation depend on the age of galaxy . if the age ( more exactly , value of @xmath97 , i.e. time since the onset of star formation ) is long , compatible to the age of the universe , the mean age is underestimated and @xmath93 is greatly overestimated leading to the severe overestimation of sfr .",
    "otherwise , the mean age is overestimated and sfr is underestimated . in the case",
    "when one tries the single - component sed - fitting for the galaxies with two clearly distinguished generations of star formation ( resembling repeated - burst models ) , the stellar mass , sfr , and mean age are all underestimated .",
    "star - formation rates estimated from the uv luminosity alone may be less biased than those estimated from sed - fitting , provided one has a reasonable estimate of @xmath93 .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that the results are less subject to the degeneracy between age and dust - extinction when we use only rest - frame uv photometry .",
    "however , the bias depends on galaxies redshift , and more significantly on the estimation of mean dust - extinction , which is challenging .",
    "a relatively small change in @xmath93 would result in large bias in uv - derived sfrs .",
    "we show that biases arising in the sed - fitting procedure can affect studies of the high - redshift , star - forming galaxies .",
    "the different directions and amounts of biases depending on galaxy s sfh can produce the artificial bimodalities in the age or sfr distributions .",
    "this can affect the interpretation of the properties and nature of these galaxies .",
    "also , the stellar mass underestimation for massive lbgs , combined with the sfr underestimation , can affect the interpretation of possible evolutionary paths for these massive lbgs .    in conclusion",
    ", we show that single - component sed - fitting generally slightly underestimates the lbgs stellar mass distributions , while the sfr distributions are significantly underestimated and the age distributions are significantly overestimated .",
    "the main causes of these biases are : ( 1 ) the difference of assumed sfhs between in the sam galaxies and simple templates used in the sed - fitting , and ( 2 ) the effects of the current generation of star formation masking the previous generation(s ) of stellar population .",
    "the well - known ` age - extinction degeneracy ' ( or ` age - extinction - redshift degeneracy ' in the case when redshifts are allowed to vary freely as an additional free parameter during the sed - fitting procedure ) plays an additional role , mainly in the estimation of sfr distributions .",
    "consequently , the directions and amounts of the biases in the sed - fitting strongly depend on galaxy s star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "if we change various inputs or fitting parameters in sed - fitting , such as the range of @xmath96  the e - folding timescale of star formation , combinations of passbands used , or assumed sfhs , the derived distributions of best - fit stellar masses , sfrs and ages can change dramatically . due to the compensating causes of biases , the best - fit stellar mass distributions are more stable against these changes than the sfr / age distributions .",
    "moreover , the behaviors of individual galaxy in various settings of the sed - fitting strongly depend on galaxy s sfh .",
    "these biases arising in the sed - fitting can have significant effects in the context of the galaxy formation / evolution studies as well as cosmological studies .",
    "besides the effects discussed in   [ discus ] , biases in the estimation of stellar mass and sfr ( which are dependent on the various input settings in the sed - fitting , on available passbands and more importantly on individual galaxy s sfh ) can affect , for example , the estimation of the stellar mass function as well as the global density of the stellar mass and sfr , which are important probes in galaxy formation / evolution .",
    "the blind comparison among various works  which were done with different input settings in the sed - fitting , with the different sets of available photometric data ( e.g. works done before or after @xmath3-era ) , or with differently - selected galaxy samples  can also misleads us .",
    "therefore , appropriate caution should be applied to the estimates of physical parameters of high - redshift , star - forming galaxies through the sed - fitting , and also to the interpretation in the context of galaxy formation / evolution based on ( the comparisons of ) the derived results .",

    "<S> we investigate the biases and uncertainties in estimates of physical parameters of high - redshift lyman break galaxies ( lbgs ) , such as stellar mass , mean stellar population age , and star formation rate ( sfr ) , obtained from broad - band photometry . </S>",
    "<S> these biases arise from the simplifying assumptions often used in fitting the spectral energy distributions ( seds ) . by combining @xmath0cdm hierarchical structure formation theory , semi - analytic treatments of baryonic physics , and stellar population synthesis models , we construct model galaxy catalogs from which we select lbgs at redshifts @xmath1 @xmath2 3.4 , 4.0 , and 5.0 . </S>",
    "<S> the broad - band photometric seds of these model lbgs are then analysed by fitting galaxy template seds derived from stellar population synthesis models with smoothly declining sfrs . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the statistical properties of lbgs physical parameters  such as stellar mass , sfr , and stellar population age  as derived from the best - fit galaxy templates with the intrinsic values from the semi - analytic model . </S>",
    "<S> we find some trends in these distributions : first , when the redshift is known , sed - fitting methods reproduce the input distributions of lbgs stellar masses relatively well , with a minor tendency to underestimate the masses overall , but with substantial scatter . </S>",
    "<S> second , there are large systematic biases in the distributions of best - fit sfrs and mean ages , in the sense that single - component sed - fitting methods underestimate sfrs and overestimate ages . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute these trends to the different star formation histories predicted by the semi - analytic models and assumed in the galaxy templates used in sed - fitting procedure , and to the fact that light from the current generation of star - formation can hide older generations of stars . </S>",
    "<S> these biases , which arise from the sed - fitting procedure , can significantly affect inferences about galaxy evolution from broadband photometry . </S>"
