    "probing exotic quantum statistics of particles is a long standing experimental challenge . in fractional quantum hall effect systems ,",
    "elementary excitations are expected to follow fractional statistics . there , it is difficult to experimentally distinguish the effects of abelian fractional statistics from the effects associated with the fractional charge attributed to the same excitations . however , for states in which the statistics is expected to be non - abelian , it is predicted that once the correct signature of this property is identified and measured , there will be no ambiguity in associating it with quantum statistics .",
    "for this reason alone , it is worth making the effort to explore the implication of non - abelian statistics on measurable quantities .",
    "non - abelian statistics is a key ingredient in the design of quantum gates for topologically protected qubits @xcite .",
    "experimental proof of the existence of non - abelian anyons would be a major step towards an implementation of topological quantum computation .",
    "most suggested experiments aimed at probing non - abelian statistics in quantum hall systems consider a system designed to form a two path interferometer .",
    "the path difference between two quasiparticle ( or quasihole ) trajectories along the edge of the system forms a closed loop around a part of the system .",
    "the electronic density is determined by the positive background charge density and does not vary with magnetic field .",
    "hence , a small deviation in the external applied magnetic field , introduces quasiparticles or quasiholes ( depending on whether the magnetic field is increased or decreased ) , localized by impurities , into the loop @xcite . as the number of these quasiparticles",
    "/ quasiholes , @xmath0 , is varied , the two terminal conductance is found to show a strong @xmath0-dependence via an interference term .",
    "other experiments@xcite considered tunneling of electrons into a large quantum dot whose interior is in a gapped quantum hall state , and predicted how the clustering property of the read - rezayi ( rr ) states should influence coulomb blockade peaks .    in this paper",
    "we have two goals .",
    "first , we extend the discussion of transport through dots in quantum hall states belonging to the read - rezayi series and characterized by coulomb blockade ; we particularly address the issue of the different time scales involved in the experiment .",
    "the fastest time scale is the time in which a current carrying electron traverses the dot , @xmath1 . for these electrons",
    "the bulk of the dot is inaccessible , and they occupy the lowest energy state on the edge .",
    "a much slower time scale is that in which the area of the dot is varied .",
    "if this scale is slow enough , the electrons that are added to the dot when its area is varied may make use of bulk states .",
    "we assume , for concreteness , that the magnetic field is tuned such that there are quasiholes localized in the bulk , rather than quasiparticles .",
    "the internal bulk states are then carried by these localized quasiholes .",
    "for that to happen , however , weak coupling should exist between the bulk quasiholes and the edges .    in previous discussions of coulomb blockade measurements in such an experiment@xcite ,",
    "the hidden assumption was that as the variation of the area adds electrons to the dot , these added electrons make use only of states at the edge . in the language of topological field theory ( tft ) , the fusion channel of all the quasihole operators in the bulk of the dot is fixed at the beginning of the experiment , and does not change as new electrons are added to the dot . in the present paper we consider the possibility that as the area is slowly varied , weak coupling of the bulk and the edge may allow for the fusion channel to change when electrons are added , in such a way that energy is minimized .",
    "second , we analyze the fabry - perot setting in another non - abelian quantum hall state , a @xmath2 spin - singlet state , whose experimental signatures have not been considered so far .",
    "this state was suggested by ardonne and schoutens@xcite .",
    "it is the first in a series of spin - singlet states with order-@xmath3 clustering , at filling fraction @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath5 states support spinful quasihole excitations with non - abelian statistics . for the paired ( @xmath6 ) state at @xmath2",
    "the quasiholes are fibonacci anyons @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a spin transition for quantum hall states around @xmath2 has been observed in samples with reduced zeeman splitting @xcite , but this feature may also indicate an unpolarized abelian state of the jain series .",
    "transport properties we analyze here may distinguish between the two candidate states .",
    "the fact that possible fractional quantum hall states in graphene are expected to be spin - singlet with respect to the pseudo - spin ( valley ) index @xcite , provides additional motivation for studying non - abelian statistics for spin - singlet states . in this paper",
    "we study coulomb blockade transport through a dot in the @xmath2 non - abelian spin - singlet state , with and without relaxation .",
    "we also analyze the lowest order interference in a fabry - perot interferometer and derive a characteristic suppression factor .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : experimental ] , we discuss the experimental setup in which these experiments are to be carried out . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cft intro ] we discuss in short the general structure of the conformal field theories ( cft ) describing these states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : rr and parafermions ] we discuss in detail the formation of coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance through large quantum dots in the rr states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : as states ] we turn to implement the same ideas to the spin singlet state in order to predict the result for the coulomb blockade peaks .",
    "we also calculate the interference term of the current in a two path interferometer for this state .",

    "the area @xmath7 of the dot may be varied using a side modulation gate.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    the fabry - perot interferometer , sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : inter - weak ] , is a hall bar with two quantum point contacts ( qpcs ) introducing quasiparticle / quasihole tunneling from one edge to the other .",
    "we deal with two opposite limits of this interferometer : weak inter - edge back - scattering , in which we look at interference to lowest order , and strong inter - edge backscattering , where the interferometer becomes a quantum dot , whose coulomb blockade peaks we study .    as mentioned above",
    ", we shall always assume that there are quasiholes , rather than quasiparticles , that are localized in the bulk .",
    "for the purpose of lowest order interference calculations , when one is also required to consider excitations on the edge , we shall consider for convenience that the current along the edge is also carried by quasiholes . changing this current to be of quasiparticles",
    "should not modify our results .",
    "lowest order interference is observed when a single quasihole does not tunnel between opposite edges more than once .",
    "the tunneling process introduces a finite value for the longitudinal conductance .",
    "the measured backscattered current , injected from the left along the lower edge and collected on the left at the upper edge , interferes only through two trajectories : quasiholes entering from the left along the lower edge are either being backscattered at the left qpc , or transmitted at the left qpc and reflected from the right one .",
    "the path difference between the two trajectories forms a closed loop around the island confined between the contacts , which may contain localized quasiholes in the bulk of the sample . for the sake of discussing lowest order interference",
    ", we assume that there is no hopping of quasiholes between the bulk and the edge .",
    "the two trajectories sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : inter - weak ] are associated with two partial waves , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "while these partial waves differ by global phases originating from the total magnetic field through the island ( due to the aharonov - bohm effect ) , their overlap also encodes information on the mutual statistics of the quasiholes in the system . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : introduction ] , this is attributed to the fact that the path difference between the two trajectories of the edge qusiholes forms a closed loop encircling localized quasiholes . altogether , the back - scattered current will be of the form @xmath10 it is the overlap @xmath11 that we calculate below .    in the limit of strong back - scattering ( fig .",
    "[ fig : inter - strong ] ) , when the two point contacts on either side of the island are almost closed , the number of electrons in the dot confined between them is quantized to an integer .",
    "quasihole or quasiparticle tunneling into and out of this region is forbidden , and the only way to transport charge through it is by tunneling of electrons .",
    "low - voltage low - temperature conductance through the dot is suppressed due to charging energy , except at `` coulomb blockade peaks '' , when the ground state energy of the dot with @xmath12 electrons is degenerate with its ground state energy with @xmath13 electrons .",
    "coulomb blockade peaks may be probed by measuring the conductance through the dot as a function of a magnetic field @xmath14 and the dot s area @xmath7 , since a variation of @xmath7 with fixed @xmath12 violates charge neutrality with the positive background @xcite .",
    "peaks in the conductance appear for those values of the area @xmath7 and magnetic field @xmath14 , for which the following equation @xmath15 is satisfied for some integer @xmath12 representing the total number of electrons inside the dot .    the quantum hall liquid is largely gapped , with two exceptions : the edge and the internal degrees of freedom of the bulk quasiholes .",
    "as we will review below , the state of the internal degrees of freedom of the bulk quasiholes determines the spectrum of the edge , that determines , in turn , the position of the coulomb peaks .    in ref .",
    "( ) , coulomb blockade peaks were mapped for large dots in a quantum hall state of the rr series @xmath16 , under the assumption that the state of the bulk quasiholes is frozen . for a clean large ( @xmath17 ) dot in a metallic state at zero magnetic field , and dots in the integer and abelian",
    "fractional quantum hall states the area spacings between consecutive coulomb blockade peaks is @xmath18 , the area occupied by one electron .",
    "in contrast , for the rr series the coulomb blockade peaks location as a function of the area at a fixed magnetic field ( i.e. , a fixed number of localized bulk quasiholes @xmath0 ) was found to depend on @xmath14 .",
    "while the average spacing between peaks remains @xmath19 , the presence of non - abelian quasiholes in the bulk causes the peaks to bunch into groups , where the number of peaks in each group depends on @xmath3 and on @xmath0 .",
    "the edge energies of the non - abelian quantum hall states we discuss in this paper are stored in a bosonic charged edge mode ( a chiral luttinger liquid ) and one or several neutral edge modes . with",
    "@xmath20 defined to be the number of electrons for a dot with area @xmath21 , the energy associated with the charge mode for @xmath12 electrons on the edge is @xcite @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the magnetic flux quantum .",
    "the magnetic field @xmath24 is that in which there are no quasiholes in the bulk , @xmath25 is the filling fraction of the partially filled topmost landau level , @xmath26 is the velocity of the charged edge mode , and @xmath27 is the perimeter of the quantum dot ( we take @xmath28 ) . for abelian laughlin states , where there is only a single bosonic mode , eq .",
    "( [ coulomb - peaks ] ) reduces to @xmath29 , and the area separation @xmath30 between its solutions for consecutive values of @xmath12 is @xmath18 , where @xmath31 is the charge density inside the dot .",
    "the value of @xmath30 in this case is independent of the magnetic field . for non - abelian states ,",
    "this is not the case .",
    "below , we focus on the contribution of the neutral mode , and add the charge contribution eq .",
    "( [ eq : charging ] ) at the final stage .",
    "the assumptions underlying the calculation performed in ref .",
    "( ) were that the magnetic field , and therefore the number of quasiholes , is fixed at the beginning of the experiment , and that the dot is relaxed into its ground state .",
    "it was also assumed that the initial number of electrons inside the dot was divisible by @xmath3 , such that all electrons are clustered in the bulk of the dot and the occupation of the electron states of the edge is zero .",
    "then , with a fixed number of quasiholes in the bulk , the area is varied fast enough such that there is no time for the electrons to relax onto states with lower energies that may be available .    here , we allow the initial number of electrons to have any integer value . for concreteness",
    "we assume that the dot has no bulk quasiholes in the beginning of the experiment .",
    "the number of electrons then dictates the number of edge modes that are initially occupied .",
    "shifting the magnetic field creates a fixed number of quasiholes in the bulk , whose fusion channel is determined by energetic considerations we explain in details later on .",
    "the process of introducing quasiholes into the bulk is done slowly enough for the edge and the bulk to equilibrate . finally , once the number of quasiholes and their fusion channel is determined , we move on to consider what happens when the area of the dot is varied .    in our analysis",
    "we consider the implications of varying the area slowly enough such that the state of the bulk quasiholes may changes adiabatically . as",
    "the area of the dot grows , more electrons are added to the dot . in the absence of edge - bulk coupling , the state of the bulk quasiholes does not change , and",
    "the added electrons affect only the state of the edge . with bulk - edge coupling , tunneling of neutral modes between the edge and the bulk quasiholes may change the state of the bulk quasiholes .",
    "we may envision both elastic and inelastic bulk - edge couplings . in the former",
    ", a tunnel coupling allows for the hopping of a neutral particle ( whose properties are to be described below@xcite ) between the bulk and the edge . in the latter ,",
    "this hopping is accompanied by an energy transfer to an outside thermal bath , e.g. , by an emission of a phonon .",
    "the latter is thus also an irreversible relaxation mechanism that allows the system to cool .",
    "quantitative estimate of these two types of couplings are not possible at our present level of understanding of the microscopy of the samples and the involved quantum hall states .",
    "both are , however , bound to exist to some level . in this work we study in details the process involving energy relaxation .",
    "we also discuss qualitatively the effect of the first process for the particular case of @xmath32 .",
    "the following argument may illuminate the way the state of the bulk quasiholes affects the spectrum of the edge : consider a sphere in a rr state with @xmath12 electrons that are all clustered in clusters of @xmath3 electrons . assume the sphere has @xmath0 quasiparticles and @xmath0 quasiholes , which are localized by impurities away from one another .",
    "the ground state is then degenerate , with the degeneracy being exponential in @xmath0 ( for large @xmath0 ) .",
    "topologically , each quasiparticle / quasihole is equivalent to a puncture in the sphere .",
    "now imagine bringing the @xmath0 quasiparticles close together , i.e. , fusing together @xmath0 of the holes pierced in the sphere .",
    "the proximity of the quasiparticles to one another lifts the degeneracy , and the way it is lifted is determined by the state to which the @xmath0 quasiparticles fuse .",
    "this system is topologically equivalent to the system we are interested in , a disk that has @xmath0 quasiholes localized in its bulk .",
    "the energies appearing on both sides of eq .",
    "( [ coulomb - peaks ] ) belong to the spectrum of the edge theory .",
    "the main challenge in obtaining the spectrum for non - abelian states is to construct the part of it that follows from the addition of a parafermion theory to that of the chiral boson contributing the charging energy eq .",
    "( [ eq : charging ] ) . in the next section ,",
    "we describe briefly and most generally what is the relation between parafermionic field theories and the quantum hall effect , and who are the main players in these theories .",
    "when discussing a particular quantum hall state , either one that belongs to the rr series or the spin singlet state , we will first specialize the discussion to the parafermionic cft relevant to it and review its properties .",
    "we will single out the parafermion used to construct the electron operator , and explain how the construction of the hilbert space is done and the spectrum is found .",
    "dwelling on the details of the parafermionic cft is also crucial in order to understand the calculation of the interference term of eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigma xx ] ) , as some of the phases of the two partial waves interfering are contributed by fields in this parafermionic theory .",
    "conformal field theories ( cfts ) are used in several different contexts regarding quantum hall systems .",
    "trial many - body wavefunctions for single landau level fractional quantum hall states are created from cfts ( in @xmath33 dimensions ) as correlators of fields representing different particles in the system @xcite .",
    "starting from chiral boson theories , one constructs abelian fractional quantum hall wavefunctions such as those in the laughlin series .",
    "including parafermionic field theories leads to wavefunctions for non - abelian quantum hall states . while explicit closed form expressions are available for rr states for general @xmath3 ( see refs .",
    "( ) ) , not all physical properties are easily explored on the basis of these wavefunctions alone .",
    "excitations at the edge of a quantum hall droplet are described by the same cfts , now viewed in @xmath34 dimensions .",
    "a theoretical construction of the paired quantum hall state at filling factor @xmath35 was originally proposed in the context of cft , and is easily understood in that language @xcite .",
    "the theoretical construction of a wavefunction for this state involves the @xmath36 theory , also known as the ising cft . the use of this cft yields the pffafian wavefunction , implying that the gapped state of the bulk is similar to that of a @xmath37 superconductor in the weak pairing phase@xcite .",
    "therefore , this state is thought of as a superconductor , a condensate of cooper - pairs of composite - fermions .",
    "the field taken from the @xmath36 theory and used to define the electron operator for the @xmath35 state is a neutral fermion , and in fact represents the composite fermion . for members of the rr series with a higher value of @xmath3 ,",
    "this composite fermion is replaced by a composite anyon , and the operator taken from the @xmath38 theory is called a parafermion ( which no longer obeys fermionic statistics ) . in that case",

    "the size of the clusters is determined by the minimal number of such parafermions which may be combined into an effective boson , which then bose - condense . for the @xmath38 theory",
    "this number is @xmath3 .",
    "the equivalent statement in the language of cft is that a parafermionic cft at level @xmath3 can be used to describe a state in which @xmath3 electrons form a cluster .",
    "this is because the fusion rules of this parafermion theory always imply that @xmath3 copies of the fundamental field used to define the electron operator fuse to the identity operator .",
    "since they were first theoretically constructed using parafermion cfts , these same cfts remained the main available theoretical tool to explore various properties of quantum hall clustered states other than the moore - read state . while the moore - read state may be conveniently explored using the theory of superconductivity , no analogous description exists for other clustered states .",

    "if the area of the dot is varied slowly with respect to the relaxation rate , then each electron has time to relax onto the lowest energy state by changing the fusion channel of the edge quasiparticles and the bulk quasiholes .",
    "each electron entering the dot will occupy the first mode of @xmath162 operating on a highest weight state , @xmath195 , which is dictated by the number of quasiholes in the bulk and the number of electrons @xmath12 that were inside the dot before the tunneling of the electron took place .",

    "@xcite    for the case @xmath6 , we find that when inelastic bulk - edge relaxation is allowed , the coulomb blockade pattern will be the same as for abelian fractional quantum hall states , with a constant spacing between peaks .",

    "it is important to stress , as we discuss in greater detail in the summary , that this smearing takes place only when the bulk - edge coupling induces inelastic relaxation , and the energy of the tunneling electron is dissipated away from the electronic system .    for other rr states , a change in the fusion channel of the bulk quasiholes , and as a result , also of the fields on the edge",

    "neutral means having no @xmath38 charge .",
    "the reason we allow for the bulk and the edge to exchange only particles with zero @xmath38 charge in order to relax the energy of the edge , is that fields that carry non trivial @xmath38 charge are always accompanied by a vertex operator that carries real electric charge .",
    "this physical assumption is required in order to keep the electron operator single - valued with respect to all possible excitation in the system .",

    "this is also true for the rr states , as was demonstrated before in refs .",

    "the result of the fusion product of all the quasiholes localized in the bulk into a single field can be obtained by fusing all the bosonic contributions into the single bosonic operator , @xmath300 , and fusing all the spin fields of the quasihole operators into a single parafermionic field .",
    "the operator that is obtained represents the internal state of the island between the two point contacts , and will ultimately determine the form of the interference term we wish to calculate .",
    "we assume here that the bulk quasiholes have a definite fusion channel .",
    "although in principle the fusion product of all the spin fields has two possible outcomes , it was shown in a previous work @xcite that the measurement procedure collapses this superposition onto a particular fusion channel .",

    "the fusion product of @xmath0 spin fields of different types may have eight different results , due to the existence of eight parafermionic fields of the @xmath221 coset .",

    "[ sec : experimental ] , and examine how different internal states of the dot affect them , hence influencing the interference term of the backscattered current .",
    "when the internal state of the island is represented by a non - abelian field , the fusion product of this field with an incoming quasihole on the edge is a superposition of two fields . to each of these",

    "for example , if there is only one localized spin up quasihole in the bulk , and the edge quasihole also has spin up , the two spin fields of the type @xmath307 fuse as follows : @xmath308 .",

    "this result agrees with the one calculated using the modular s - matrix@xcite in a similar fashion to the calculation presented in ref .",
    "( ) for lowest order interference in the rr series .",
    "the above result is calculated without making any assumptions on the nature of the edge qusiholes that tunnels across the point contact , and is therefore general .",
    "however , it is expected that the most prominent contribution to these tunneling events will come from the quasihole with the lowest conformal dimension .",
    "for that reason , one may expect mostly spinless quasiholes to tunnel across the junction .",
    "the interference term for these quasiparticle is given by equation ( [ eq : inter term su3 ] ) with @xmath381 and @xmath382 .",
    "in this work we studied transport through a device known as the two point - contact ( or the fabry - perot ) interferometer formed using edge states of non - abelian quantum hall phases . we have focused on the rr series at filling factor @xmath383 , and on one of the spin singlet states that may be appropriate to describe the plateau at filling factor @xmath384 .    for the limit of strong quasihole backscattering at the two point contacts , where the topmost partially filled level forms a closed trajectory around the `` island '' formed between the point contacts ,",
    "transport is characterized by a series of coulomb blockade peaks in the conductance as a function of the area enclosed by this trajectory .",
    "for the rr states we explained in details the results obtained in ref .",
    "( ) , and analyzed the effect of relaxation of the edge states of the parafermionic theory into states with lower energy by adjusting the fusion channel of the bulk quasiholes .",
    "we found that this relaxation , mediated by neutral fields of the parafermion theory flowing between the bulk and the edge , modifies the spacing between peaks . without relaxation ,",
    "the coulomb blockade pattern predicted  @xcite is a bunching of peaks into groups of @xmath385 and @xmath386 peaks ( where @xmath0 is the number of quasiholes localized in the bulk ) .",
    "therefore the periodicity of the peak structure is @xmath3 , unless @xmath3 is even and @xmath387 , in which case the periodicity is @xmath192 ( assuming , for convenience , that the initial number of electrons in the dot was divisible by @xmath3 ) .",
    "when relaxation is introduced between consecutive electron - tunneling events , this structure changes such that the number of bulk quasiholes no longer influences the periodicity of the entire structure .",
    "the periodicity is @xmath3 for odd @xmath3 and @xmath192 for even @xmath3 . for the @xmath6 moore - read state",
    ", we predict that in the presence of relaxation of majorana fermions from the edge of the dot into the bulk , the even - odd effect predicted in ref .",
    "( ) will not be observed .",
    "therefore , for that state relaxation eliminates the unique signature for non - abelian statistics and clustering .",
    "we would like to stress the difference between two time scales relevant for the experiments we discuss here , that of relaxation of the edge states which is discussed in the coulomb blockade context , and that of quasihole exchange between the bulk and the edge , which is neglected altogether .",
    "the two scales are related to different mechanisms and are generally very different .",
    "the first involves an exchange of neutral particles between the edge and the bulk , and the second involves tunneling of a charged particle ( with both non - zero @xmath38 and electric charge ) .",
    "the charging energy involved in the latter is expected to make this time scale much longer than the former : hopping of quasiholes between the bulk and the edge involves energy scales of the order of the bulk gap , while relaxation of edge states via the exchange of neutral modes involves an energy which is much smaller and scales as @xmath388 , where @xmath27 is the perimeter of the dot .",
    "little can be said about these time scales quantitatively , since they crucially depend on disorder in the sample , and in a way that is not presently understood .",
    "the microscopic mechanism which induces relaxation is beyond the scope of this paper . since at present there are many fundamental aspects of the microscopic theory of non - abelian quantum hall states that are not well understood , we investigate the implication of such a mechanism on a phenomenological level and provide a prediction that follows form it . while not giving quantitative estimates , our paper brings to light the possible effect of the time scales related to these mechanisms on experiments in non - abelian quantum hall states .",
    "a few particular sentences are in order with respect to the even - odd effect at @xmath32 , both because it is at present the closest to experimental realization and because it stands out as a special case in our analysis .",
    "we have found , that in the presence of an inelastic bulk - edge coupling that allows the system to be at its ground state all throughout the experiment , and in the presence of bulk quasiholes , the edge mode stays unpopulated in the ground state for any number of electrons in the dot .",
    "thus , under this condition no even - odd effect of the coulomb blockade peaks will be observed .",
    "however , we stress that the situation is different when the bulk edge coupling is elastic , as considered for example in ( ) . in that case , the spectrum of the combined bulk - edge system is shifted by the coupling .",
    "the coupling introduces a time scale for a majorana fermion to tunnel back and forth between the edge and the bulk .",
    "as long as this time scale is much longer than the time at which the majorana fermion encircles the dot , @xmath389 , the bulk - edge coupling does not significantly affect the spectrum , and an even - odd effect is to be observed .    for the spin singlet state at @xmath2",
    "we have mapped the location of the coulomb blockade peaks as a function of the area of the dot , and showed that it follows a periodicity of @xmath144 or @xmath249 . moreover , although the modulations from equal spacings change when relaxation is introduced , the periodicity remains unaffected .",
    "one should also note another crucial difference between the rr states and the spin - singlet state , that may be observed in such an experiment .",
    "the extent to which peaks are bunched in the rr state is determined by the ratio of the velocity of the neutral modes to that of the charged modes , @xmath390 , as they propagate along the edge .",
    "these velocities are hard to determine ; in the absence of landau level mixing and for an infinitely sharp confining potential , dimensional analysis determines that the interaction - induced velocity is , up to a dimensionless number , @xmath391 , with @xmath175 being the dielectric constant .",
    "the dimensionless number may be evaluated only numerically , and one expects it to be larger for a charged mode than for a neutral one .",
    "indeed , recent numerical studies@xcite for @xmath32 predict that the two velocities differ by an order of magnitude .",
    "if that trend persists to rr states of higher @xmath3 , then the effect of bunching in the rr states may be difficult to observe in experiment .",
    "in contrast , the size of the modulations in the spacing between coulomb blockade peaks for the spin - singlet state is determined by two contributions , the first is @xmath390 which may be small for this state as well , and the second is @xmath392 , the ratio between the velocity of the spin and charge excitations . if this ratio is not small , then these modulations may still be observed .",
    "note , however , that in the extreme case of @xmath393 , the periodicity in some cases may seem to reduce from @xmath249 to @xmath144 ( see table [ tab : tunneling sequences ] ) .",
    "moreover , as we point out below , these modulations in the spacings due to the spin degree of freedom , may not be unique for a non - abelian state .",
    "while it was shown before that coulomb blockade peaks are equally spaced for the laughlin states , the case of other abelian quantum hall states was not discussed ( when the parameter varied is the area of the dot , which keeps the number of bulk quasiholes fixed ) .",
    "one may expect that for abelian hierarchy states peaks may not be equally spaced , since the edge theory describing these states is made of several chiral boson theories .",
    "however , we expect that the structure and its periodicity in particular will not show dependence on the number bulk quasiholes .",
    "thus , several measurements at slightly different values of the magnetic field , should in principle distinguish an abelian hierarchy state from a non - abelian one .",
    "for the spin - singlet state at @xmath2 it may be more difficult to distinguish such abelian states from non - abelian ones , since modulation may still occur for @xmath394 due to spin .",
    "however , the periodicity of the peak structure predicted is different for negligible and non - negligible values of @xmath390 , and this will ultimately distinguish an abelian state from a non - abelian one . the case of other abelian states may be slightly more complicated .",
    "for example , the @xmath395 halperin state may show bunching as well as a dependence on the number of quasiholes.@xcite    finally , we considered lowest order interference effects in the fabry - perot interferometer , and calculated the form of the backscattered quasihole current through this device .",
    "for the non - abelian spin - singlet state we have found that interference will be suppressed by a damping factor that is equal to the one obtained for the rr state with @xmath379 in ref .",
    "the phase of the interference term has a rich structure , and is influenced by the number of quasiholes localized in the bulk , their total charge and spin , and the spin of the interfering quasihole .",
