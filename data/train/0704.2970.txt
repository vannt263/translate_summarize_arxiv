    "x - ray spectra and variability provide important evidence to suggest that accretion systems of agn are analogous to those of their smaller counterparts , the black hole binary ( bhb ) systems .",
    "both show two major components in their high energy spectra , the accretion disc , together with a tail of emission extending to higher energies .",
    "the accretion disc temperature should scale with both mass ( @xmath2 ) and mass accretion rate ( hereafter parameterised as @xmath3 ) as @xmath4  k ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "this component peaks in the soft x  ray range for bright bhb , but correspondingly large @xmath3 agn have discs which peak in the uv  optical region of the spectrum .",
    "this complicates a detailed comparison of the two systems . in bhb",
    "the x  ray spectra contain contributions from both the disc and tail , whereas in agn only the tail should contribute .",
    "this is particularly important as bhb show a complex range of _ spectral states _ , which can be roughly determined by the luminosity ratio between the disc and tail , together with the shape of the tail ( see e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) . in bhb",
    "these can all be ( more or less ) determined simply from a single x  ray spectrum , whereas to constrain the disc emission in agn requires simultaneous uv  optical as well as x  ray data .",
    "this is now easily obtainable with the launch of the xmm - newton satellite , which carries the optical monitor telescope with optical / uv filters , as well as the sensitive epic x  ray ccd s .    in bhb the disc and high energy tail",
    "are well known to have different variability properties on short timescales , where the disc is rather constant while the high energy tail is not ( e.g churazov gilfanov & revnivtsev 2001 ) .",
    "the effects of the stable accretion disc diluting the observed x  ray variability is important in bhb , but when this effect is corrected for then the agn and bhb show very similar variability power spectra ( done & gierliski 2005 ) , with characteristic frequencies simply scaling with mass for a given @xmath3 ( mchardy et al 2006 ) .",
    "this points to the same underlying physical mechanisms for forming the tail in both systems , strongly supporting models in which the accretion processes are the same",
    ".    however , despite this overall correspondence between the two systems , there are clear discrepancies which remain unexplained .",
    "firstly there is the ` soft excess ' seen ubiquitously in high @xmath3 agn .",
    "this is a smooth rise above the extrapolation of the higher energy continuum below @xmath5  1  kev .",
    "this energy is too high to be explained by the standard accretion disk model above , and alternative continuum models such as comptonization of the disc ( e.g. czerny & elvis 1987 ; page et al 2004 ) or a super - eddington slim disk ( e.g. abramowicz et al .",
    "1988 ; tanaka , boller & gallo 2005 ) have problems in explaining why this component is always seen at the same energy in agn spanning a large range in mass ( gierliski & done 2004 : hereafter gd04 ) , and why this has no obvious counterpart in the bhb ( gd04 ; sobolewska & done 2007 ) .",
    "secondly , some of these high @xmath3 have apparently flat 210  kev spectra .",
    "bhb at correspondingly high @xmath3 normally have rather steep tails to high energies , with photon index @xmath6 when characterised by a power law ( e.g. the review by remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "both these problems can be addressed if there is substantial distortion of the agn spectra by atomic processes .",
    "this rather naturally gives rise to a fixed energy for the soft excess from the dramatic increase in opacity in partially ionised material at @xmath7 0.7  kev provided by o vii / o viii and the fe m shell unresolved transition array ( uta ) .",
    "the observed smoothness of the soft excess then requires that this partially ionised material has strong velocity gradients to remove any lines or edges by doppler smearing",
    ". this material can affect the spectrum in two rather different geometrical configurations , either in optically thick material seen in reflection ( e.g. crummy et al . 2006 ) or optically thin material seen in absorption ( e.g. gierliski & done 2004 ; chevallier et al .",
    "2006 ) , but in both models the enhanced opacity above 0.7  kev can lead to an apparently flat 210  kev spectrum even when the intrinsic emission is steep .",
    "this all makes a compelling case for there to be substantial amounts of partially ionised , doppler smeared material in agn .",
    "even if the same material is present in bhb it would not be easily seen as the higher temperature accretion disc will result in complete photoionization of oxygen , so will not produce the strong opacity jump at 0.7  kev . in which case the question becomes whether this material is seen in reflection or absorption .",
    "this has additional importance as the difference between absorption and reflection mechanisms implies not only differing physical geometries but also a difference in the inferred properties of the spacetime ( gierliski & done 2006 ) .    in the reflection models , the strength of the soft excess is limited if the source is isotropic .",
    "the maximum reflected continuum below 0.7  kev equals the incident continuum , and even including line emission results in a soft excess of no more than a factor of 2 - 3 above the extrapolated 210  kev continuum ( sobolewska & done 2007 ) .",
    "this is exceeded by many high @xmath3 agn , dramatically so by a few objects .",
    "thus the reflection geometry also requires anisotropic illumination from either gravitational light bending or a corrugated disc surface which acts to hide a large proportion of the incident flux from the line of sight ( fabian et al .",
    "2002a ; miniutti et al 2003 ; miniutti & fabian 2004 ) .",
    "the problem becomes even more marked if the reflecting disc material is in hydrostatic equilibrium , as the details of the pressure balance means that there is only a small optical depth in the disc photosphere where oxygen can be partially ionised .",
    "thus these models give much smaller soft excess than a constant density reflecting slab ( done & nayakshin 2007 ) .",
    "instead , the absorption model sets no such restrictive limits on the size of the soft excess , so does not require any geometry change to produce the strongest observed soft excesses ( sobolewska & done 2007 ) .",
    "additionally , and in stark contrast to the reflection models , any pressure balance condition rather naturally produces the required ( now much smaller ) optical depth of partially ionised oxygen ( chevallier et al 2006 ) .",
    "while this all supports the absorption model , these arguments are indirect , relying on physical plausibility . a clear observational test between the two models would be more convincing .",
    "however , detailed studies of individual objects have shown that even good quality xmm - newton data in the 0.310  kev bandpass can not distinguish between reflection and absorption model for the origin of the spectral features ( chevallier et al .",
    "2006 ; sobolewska & done 2007 ) .",
    "similarly , the 0.310  kev variability rms spectra of individual objects can also be equally well matched by both models ( ponti et al .",
    "2006 ; gierliski & done 2006 ) .",
    "this is the case even for the canonical reflection dominated , broad line source , mcg-6 - 30 - 15 , for which the 0.3 - 10  kev spectrum and r.m.s .",
    "variability can be well fit by both reflection and absorption models ( done 2007 ; gierliski & done 2006 ) . even extending the bandpass to 40  kev ( such as with the suzaku hxd",
    ": miniutti et al 2007 ) does not break the model degeneracy of the spectra for this object ( done 2007 ) , though the fact that the variable component can be well fit by a simple absorbed power law is plainly consistent with the reflection modelling ( miniutti et al 2007 ) .    here",
    "instead we analyse the spectra of a large sample of pg quasars and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies observed with the absorption models .",
    "this sample has previously been studied by crummy et al ( 2006 ) , who fit the smeared reflection model so allowing a direct comparison of fit quality over a larger number of objects , with a large spread in spectral shape .",
    "we use xmm - newton data so we can directly constrain the disc simultaneously with the high energy tail , and so directly test whether these do indeed correspond to the bhb high @xmath3 spectra states , and identify where the anomalous soft excess and hard 210  kev spectra arise .    [ cols=\"<,^,<,<,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the results of the fits with our absorption model are shown in table  [ tab : compare ] .",
    "the reduced @xmath8 are statistically indistinguishable from those obtained in the reflection fits of crummy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) over the large sample of objects .",
    "both reflection and absorption models have enough freedom to produce an acceptable fit the data over the 0.310  kev bandpass of a wide range of different spectral shapes , especially given the presence of the narrow warm absorber systems as well .    figs .",
    "[ fig : hist_ion ] and [ fig : hist_nh ] shows the derived @xmath9 and @xmath10 for the wind .",
    "plainly they are strongly peaked at @xmath11 and @xmath12 @xmath13 , respectively . this apparent fine ",
    "tuning can be explained as a consequence of the rapid change in ionization which is produced self  consistently in x  ray illuminated systems with some pressure balance condition ( krolik , mckee & tarter 1981 ; chevallier et al 2006 ) .",
    "the x  ray illuminated face of the cloud is heated to the compton temperature , so expands and has low density .",
    "this means its ionization parameter , @xmath14 is high , and the material is fully ionised and hence invisible . further into the cloud the x - ray heating is less effective due to scattering in the upper layers ,",
    "so the density increases in order to maintain pressure .",
    "this increases the importance of bremsstrahlung cooling , pulling the temperature down further , and increasing the density .",
    "eventually @xmath9 drops below @xmath15 where not all species are ionised and bound  free and bound  bound transitions dramatically increase the cooling .",
    "the density drops very rapidly , which further decreases the ionization , leading to the possibility of yet more line transitions .",
    "this runaway cooling only stops when the material is nearly neutral , so a further decrease in ionization does not lead to an increase in the available line transitions .",
    "the corresponding rapid contraction of the cloud ( required to enhance the density ) may lead to fragmentation of this low ionization part of the cloud into clumps .",
    "a line of sight through the cloud goes through the highly ionized layer ( small opacity ) , the transition layer ( mean @xmath16 and column of @xmath17 @xmath13 ) but is not likely to intercept any of the opaque cool clumps as these have low covering factor ( chevallier et al 2006 ) .",
    "table 3 shows the individual best - fit wind velocity dispersions within our model .",
    "the values are large , with many pegged at the upper limit of @xmath18 .",
    "most of these can be somewhat reduced allowing the smeared absorber to be blue ( or red ) shifted .",
    "this has no effect on the intrinsic spectral index but tends to decrease the derived column and ionisation parameter by a factor 2 ( fairly negligible on a log plot such as figs 6 and 7 ) .",
    "nonetheless , even with this extra degree of freedom the velocity dispersion rarely drops below @xmath19 due to the requirement that the soft excess is a single smooth component , while atomic processes give _ two _ strong features , associated with ovii / viii at 0.7 - 0.8",
    "kev and fe l at 1.5 - 2 kev , respectively .",
    "this is still too large to be associated with the uv line driven disc wind which _ must _ be present in such high @xmath3 agn .",
    "proga ( 2004 ) show that such winds have terminal velocities of @xmath20 , corresponding to a gaussian dispersion at least a factor 2 smaller ( more precisely , @xmath21 for constant acceleration : schurch & done 2007 ) .",
    "thus this requires that the outflow is magnetically driven ( associated with the jet ? ) if the soft excess really is due to smeared absorption .",
    "[ fig : hist_gamma ] shows the inferred intrinsic power law index . unlike the apparent 210  kev index shown in fig 3 . , there are now _ no _ objects with spectra significantly harder than @xmath22 .",
    "this is not the case for the reflection models of crummy et al ( 2006 ) , where pg  1048 + 342 , pg  1211 + 143 , pg  1307 + 085 and ( especially ) mkn  359 are all inferred to have hard spectra .",
    "this is an important difference arguing in favour of the absorption modelling as high mass accretion rate bhb almost always show soft spectra , so by analogy we expect the high mass accretion rate agn to do likewise .",
    "this histogram also shows that the nls1 s have somewhat softer spectra than the broad line agn , with @xmath23 as opposed to @xmath24 ( see also brandt et al 1997 ) . by analogy with the bhb , this might indicate that the nls1 s correspond to the very high state , characterised by a soft tail , with @xmath25 , while the broad line agn correspond to the high / soft ( or thermal dominant ) state , where the tail has @xmath26 ( remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "given that the nls1 also have significantly higher @xmath3 than the broad line agn ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_lall ] ) then it is also clear that in our sample the intrinsic spectral index will correlate with @xmath3 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gamma_lall ] , and is remarkably well defined , especially considering the uncertainties in determining mass for these agn . there is no such clear correlation in the galactic binaries but this is probably due to hysteresis complicating their observed behaviour ( e.g. remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "it is now clear that hysteresis in black hole binaries is connected to the dramatic disc instability ( gladstone , done & gierlinski 2007 ) , which probably does not occur in agn ( done & gierlinski 2005 ) .",
    "thus it may be that agn show the intrinsic ( steady state ) accretion flow properties more clearly than black hole binaries , and have spectral index correlated with @xmath3 ( shemmer et al 2006 ) .",
    "the full observational criteria for bhb spectral state involve the fraction of the disc to total luminosity as well as the shape of the tail . for those observations for which there are at least two xmm-_newton _ om data points we can construct the @xmath27 sed spanning the optical - uv - x  ray range , i.e. covering both the disc and comptonized tail .",
    "this means we can characterise the full accretion power of the system , and derive the disc to total power ratio , and hence determine spectral state .",
    "we use the parameters of our the best fitting model derived in section 3 to deconvolve the data from the instrument response , and to correct for neutral absorption ( both from our galaxy and the agn host galaxy ) and narrow xstar ionised absorption . on top of these",
    "absorption corrected , deconvolved data , we also plot the best estimate for the intrinsic comptonized spectrum ( cyan , with seed photons assumed to be at the same temperature of the disc , see below ) and the effect of smeared absorption on this ( magenta ) . the inferred intrinsic reflection component is also included on the plot ( green ) and the total ( intrinsic plus reflection , both absorbed by the smeared wind ) fit to the data ( blue ) .",
    "we use the upper and lower limits on the ( galactic and host galaxy ) neutral @xmath10 to get upper and lower limits in the optical / uv reddening ( predehl & schmidt 1995 ) .",
    "these are used to get uncertainties on the dereddened optical / uv flux from the om data .",
    "we include an additional standard diskbb model with normalization and temperature determined from the tabulated m@xmath28 and l / l@xmath29 for each agn ( red ) .",
    "this should generally overestimate the optical / uv flux , since this assumes that the entire bolometric luminosity is produced in the disc .",
    "the fact that this generally matches to the data shows immediately that this is a fairly good approximation for most of these agn , and that the high energy tail ( cyan ) is not energetically dominant , though there are a few exceptions to this ( e1346 + 266 and re j1034 + 396 ) .",
    "since the luminosity is taken simply from the tabulated values then time variability is also an issue , hence we also show a disc spectrum which gives a better match to the om points ( dotted red line ) .",
    "there are a few objects where the optical / uv spectra have a very different slope than that predicted by disc models , the nls1 s mrk  766 and ngc  4051 .",
    "these are also objects where the black hole mass is low enough and @xmath3 high enough for the predicted disc spectra to extend into the soft x  ray band .",
    "since the disc was not included in the x  ray spectral model then its presence would lead to an underestimate of the x  ray column density .",
    "this would underestimate the internal host galaxy reddening which could lead to the observed downturn in optical / uv flux .",
    "hence we refit the x  ray data of these objects including the disc component .",
    "the increased reddening in ngc  4051 is sufficient to reverse the optical / uv slope , making it much more compatible with the expected accretion disc spectrum .",
    "however , this is not the case for mrk  766 , where the optical data clearly appear absorbed even with a larger host galaxy column .",
    "we suggest that these data are indeed strongly reddened , perhaps from a dust entrained in the narrow warm absorber systems in a similar manner to mcg63015 ( reynolds 1997 ; kraemer et al 2000 ; ballantyne , weingartner & murray 2003 ) .",
    "we use these best estimates of the unabsorbed disc spectrum ( dotted red line ) to quantify the ratio of luminosity in the tail to the total luminosity or l@xmath30/l@xmath31 . in bhb the high / soft ( thermal dominant ) state is defined as l@xmath32/l@xmath33 0.75 , while the intermediate / very high state ( steep power law state ) is defined to have @xmath34 and @xmath35 . by contrast",
    "the low / hard state has @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "the values of these ratios and the inferred analogous xrb states are given in table 6 , and the histogram of this for the entire sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_ldisc ] .",
    "this shows a less clear cut distinction between the nls1 and broad line agn than in fig .",
    "[ fig : hist_gamma ] . while the nls1 spectral indices are indeed steep , as expected for the very high state in bhb",
    ", they do _ not _ in general have @xmath38 . also , they do not in general have a significantly smaller @xmath39 than the broad line agn ( though the objects with the weakest discs are nls1 s ) , as expected if the nls1 correspond to the very high state , while the broad line agn correspond to the high / soft state .",
    "this lack of correspondence with the bhb could be due to lack of data in the extreme uv where the disc spectra peak .",
    "the disc luminosities are inferred assuming that their spectra follow the expected standard form , yet there is clear evidence in bhb that this is not the case in the very high state , where discs in bhb can show much lower maximum temperature than expected for their luminosity ( kubota & done 2004 ; done & kubota 2006 ) .",
    "if the nls1 s are indeed analogous to the very high state and have similarly distorted disc spectra then our estimate of total disc luminosity from the optical / uv flux is too high .",
    "there is some evidence to support this in ngc  4051 , as the high temperature , luminous disc component shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : xraydisc ] is strongly ruled out by the xmm - newton data .",
    "we show that the x  ray spectra of a heterogeneous sample of qsos and nls1 s can be equally well fit by partially ionised , doppler smeared material seen in absorption as by the the alternative geometry where this material is optically thick and seen in reflection ( crummy et al 2006 ) .",
    "thus the 0.310  kev spectral data alone can not distinguish the underlying geometry of this partially ionised material , nor in fact can it unambiguously show that it does indeed exist as the doppler smearing is so extreme as to merge the characteristic atomic features into a quasi  continuum .",
    "thus we have only indirect evidence for its existence , namely the peak in rms variability spectra between 0.73  kev ( e.g. ponti et al 2006 ; gierliski & done 2006 ) , and the constant temperature of the soft excess component , together with the fact that this material can also distort the higher energy spectra , producing occasional apparently anomalously hard ( by comparison with high @xmath3 bhb ) 210  kev spectra .",
    "similarly indirect arguments from physical plausibility support a geometry in which this material is optically thin and seen in absorption ( chevallier et al 2006 ; sobolewska & done 2007 ; done & nayakshin 2007 ) . such absorption is likely to be very complex , clumpy , and time dependent , with multiple velocity structures .    nonetheless , despite the difficulties in producing realistic models to compare with the data",
    ", even the simple models used here can begin to reconstruct the intrinsic x  ray emission .",
    "these reinforce the links between supermassive and stellar black holes , as the inferred intrinsic x  ray spectra are all soft , as expected by analogy with the high mass accretion rates ( high / soft and very high ) states in the binary systems .",
    "all objects with the apparently hard 210  kev spectral indices can be explained as being intrinsically soft , but strongly distorted by the smeared absorption .",
    "furthermore , there is a clear correlation between the intrinsic x  ray index and the type of agn , with nls1 s having softer x  ray spectra than broad line agn , consistent with them being the analogues of the very high state while the broad line agn are identified with the high / soft state . respectively .",
    "however , this analogy does _ not _ appear to hold in terms of the ratio of disc to total luminosity .",
    "the very high state in bhb has the disc be less than 80 per cent of the total accretion power , while the nls1 s show a range of values , with many having the disc more dominant than expected .",
    "this could point to subtle differences in how spectral states are seen between stellar and supermassive black holes , but we stress that this could also result from a lack of data in the euv region where the disc luminosity peaks .",
    "disc spectra in the very high state in bhb are often somewhat distorted .",
    "similar distortions in the nls1 would result in an overestimate of the total disc flux inferred from the observed optical / uv points .",
    "this could recover a straightforward correspondence between the spectral states as seen in bhb and agn type ."
