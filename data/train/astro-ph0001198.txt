    "a puzzling problem is to understand why different galaxies have such widely different young cluster populations as is observed .",
    "the star clusters in the milky way clearly do not constitute a representative cluster sample , as is evident already from a superficial comparison with our nearest extragalactic neighbours , the magellanic clouds .",
    "it was noted early on that the clouds , in particular the , contain a number of very massive , young clusters that do not have any counterparts in our own galaxy ( van den bergh @xcite ; richtler @xcite ) .",
    "many recent studies have shown the presence of such `` young massive clusters '' ( ymcs ) also in a number of mergers and starburst galaxies ( see e.g. list in harris @xcite ) and it is clear that the occurrence of such objects is often associated with violent star formation , leading to the formation of a large number of ymcs within a few times @xmath1 years or so .",
    "this does not explain , however , why other galaxies like the magellanic clouds are able to maintain the formation of ymcs over a much longer time span . ymcs with a broad age distribution have also been found in a few other galaxies , e.g. the blue compact galaxy ( stlin et al .",

interacting , mildly inclined galaxies , and identified rich populations of ymcs in about a quarter of the galaxies in the sample .",
    "within the range of hubble types surveyed ( sbc  irr ) , no correlation was found between the morphological type of the galaxies and their contents of ymcs . in the present paper",
    "we show that the richness of the cluster systems is indeed well correlated with certain other properties of the host galaxies , indicative of a dependence on the star formation rate .",
    "we extend our sample relative to paper1 by also including literature data for a variety of different star - forming galaxies , and show that the correlations inferred from our sample are further strengthened when the additional data are included .",
    "hence , it seems that starburst galaxies with their very rich populations of ymcs represent only an extreme manifestation of the cluster formation process , while the conditions that allow ymcs to be formed can be present also in normal galaxies .",
    "the data reduction procedure and identification of ymcs have been discussed elsewhere ( paper1 ; larsen @xcite ) and we shall not repeat the details here .",
    "we just mention that the clusters were identified using broad - band photometry , applying a colour criterion of @xmath63 ( mainly in order to exclude foreground stars ) and an absolute visual magnitude limit of @xmath64 for objects with @xmath65 and @xmath66 for @xmath67 .",
    "the @xmath68 colour cut - off corresponds to an age of about 500 myr ( girardi et al .",
    "@xcite ) and the lower mass limit is of the order of @xmath69 , assuming a salpeter imf extending down to 0.1  ( bruzual & charlot @xcite ) .",
    "`` fuzzy '' objects and hii regions were excluded by a combination of visual inspection and h@xmath70 photometry ( see larsen @xcite for details ) .",
    "hence , we define an object that satisfies these criteria to be a young massive cluster .    following the definition of the `` specific frequency '' @xmath71 for old globular cluster systems ( harris & van den bergh @xcite ) , we defined an equivalent quantity for young clusters in paper1 :    @xmath72    here @xmath2 is the total number of ymcs in a galaxy , and @xmath73 is the absolute @xmath74 magnitude of the galaxy",
    ". @xmath6 is then a measure of the number of clusters , normalised to the luminosity of the host galaxy .",
    "there are , however , several problems in defining a `` specific frequency '' for young clusters .",
    "since old globular cluster systems have a log - normal like luminosity function ( lf ) , the total number of old clusters belonging to a given galaxy is a well - defined quantity , and can be estimated with good accuracy even if the least luminous clusters can not be observed directly .",
    "young clusters , on the other hand , usually exhibit a power - law luminosity function of the form @xmath75 with an increasing number of clusters at fainter magnitudes .",
    "hence , @xmath6 depends sensitively on the definition one adopts for a ymc , and it is difficult to compare literature data unless the exact selection parameters are known .",
    "moreover , incompleteness effects and errors in the distance modulus always affect the number of clusters in the faintest magnitude bins most severely , and this leads to large uncertainties in @xmath6 .",
    "another possibility is to consider the total _",
    "luminosity _ of the cluster system compared to that of the host galaxy .",
    "this approach has the advantage of being independent of the distance modulus and interstellar absorption . following harris ( @xcite ) , we define the _ specific luminosity _ @xmath76 where @xmath77 and @xmath78 are the total luminosities of the cluster system and of the host galaxy , respectively .",
    "it makes no difference if the absolute or apparent luminosities are used in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tu ] ) , and corrections for reddening only play a role through the selection criteria for identification of ymcs .",
    "as long as the exponent @xmath70 in the lf ( eq .",
    "( [ eq : ymclf ] ) ) is less than 2 , most of the light originates from the _ bright _ end of the lf .",
    "a typical value is @xmath79 ( elmegreen & efremov @xcite ; harris & pudritz @xcite ) , although slopes of @xmath80 have also been reported ( e.g. for ngc  3921 , schweizer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . in any case",
    ", @xmath81 is much less sensitive to incompleteness effects at the lower end of the lf than the specific frequency .",
    "we remark that the brighter end of the lf of old globular cluster systems is also well described by a power - law distribution with an exponent similar to that observed for the young cluster populations .",
    "this has stimulated attempts to create a universal theoretical description of the formation of old globular clusters in the halo of the milky way and elsewhere as well as the present - day formation of young star clusters ( elmegreen & efremov @xcite ; mclaughlin & pudritz @xcite ) .",
    "the basic data related to the cluster systems considered in this paper are given in table  [ tab : bprop ] .",
    "the number of ymcs @xmath2 and corresponding specific frequencies @xmath6 are taken from paper1 , and in addition we now also list the absolute magnitude of the brightest cluster in each galaxy @xmath3 and the @xmath0- and @xmath82-band specific luminosities  and .",
    "the @xmath6 values in tables  [ tab : bprop ] have not been corrected for completeness effects , which can be quite significant in particular for the more distant galaxies like ( larsen @xcite ) .",
    "however , we are not going to refer much to @xmath6 in this paper for the reasons given in sect .",
    "[ sec : defs ] but will instead use specific luminosities .",
    "we remark that the often very luminous clusters found near the centres of certain `` hot spot '' galaxies ( e.g. , maoz et al .",
    "@xcite and , heap et al .",
    "@xcite ) have not been considered in this study , but only clusters in the disks .",
    "in addition to the paper1 sample , we also include literature data for a number of ( mostly ) starburst and merger galaxies ( see references in the caption to table  [ tab : bprop ] ) . since the clusters in these galaxies were not identified according to a homogeneous set of criteria we do not list @xmath6 values , except for the lmc where the published photometry reaches below @xmath64 . the photometry published for clusters in the remaining galaxies does not go as deep as ours but as we have argued above",
    ", the total integrated magnitude of a cluster system is normally dominated by the brighter clusters , so we have calculated  and  values for all galaxies based on the available data .",
    "not all studies list @xmath83 colours , but these have been estimated from the published cluster ages and the girardi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) `` s''-sequence .",

    "@xmath40 is the logarithm of the face - on diameter of the galaxy , and the last two columns in table  [ tab : intdata ] list the area - normalised star formation rate  and the hi surface density  derived from  and @xmath37 ( see sect .",

    "the rc3 as well as the iras data were retrieved through the nasa / ipac extragalactic database .",
    "in this section we discuss correlations between various host galaxy properties and the specific @xmath0-band luminosity .",
    "we use  because the @xmath0-band most cleanly samples the _ young _ stellar populations in a galaxy , and therefore provides the purest measure of _ current _ cluster formation activity .",
    "+    first , we consider only the galaxies studied in paper1 . in paper1",
    "we showed that there is no evident correlation between @xmath6 and the hubble type of the host galaxy . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t_tlu ] we show  instead of @xmath6 as a function of the hubble type , but this does not change the conclusion - there is no clear trend in  as a function of hubble type either .",
    "the earliest type represented in our sample is sbc ( type 4.0 in the rc3 terminology ) , and the latest is i m ( type 10.0 in rc3 ) . independently of morphological type",
    ", we find a range from galaxies with practically no ymcs to very rich cluster systems in our sample , so even if ymcs might be systematically absent in galaxies of even earlier types , the presence of ymcs can not be entirely related to morphology .",
    "furthermore , some of the galaxies with high  values are grand - design spirals ( , ) , other grand - design spirals are relatively cluster - poor ( e.g. , ) , while the flocculent galaxy also has a high  value , so the presence of a spiral density wave is apparently not a discriminating factor either .",
    "no galaxies of types sa and sb were included in our sample , primarily because of a general lack of sufficiently nearby galaxies of these types ( see paper1 for a more detailed discussion of the selection criteria ) .",
    "we therefore continue to look for other host galaxy parameters that could correlate with . even for the relatively nearby galaxies in our sample ,",
    "it is not an easy task to find homogeneous sets of observations of integrated properties that allow a comparison of all galaxies , mainly because the most complete data exist for the northern hemisphere while many of our galaxies are in the southern sky .",
    "for example , existing co surveys have included only few of our galaxies ( elfhag et al .",
    "@xcite ; young et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we are therefore largely limited to discussing optical data , hi data and far - infrared data from the iras survey .    in order to reach independence of distance and absolute galaxy luminosity ,",
    "we normalise the fir flux to the @xmath74-band magnitude of a galaxy by using the `` fir  b '' index  = @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig : tu1 ] shows  as a function of various integrated host galaxy parameters : the  index , the @xmath74-band surface brightness , the integrated @xmath84 colour and the iras  flux ratio . the @xmath84 and",
    "the @xmath74 band data have been corrected for galactic foreground extinction ( as given in table  [ tab : bprop ] ) , but not for internal absorption in the galaxies .",
    "the latter correction would move the points around slightly , but neither reduce the scatter significantly nor change the conclusions .",
    "we have therefore avoided to apply this anyway quite uncertain correction .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : tu1 ] we first note the striking correlations between  and  and the surface brightness @xmath36 .",
    "this is of great interest because both these parameters can be taken as indicators for the star formation rate in the host galaxy ( kennicutt @xcite ) .",
    "we stress that , because we are operating with specific luminosities this is not just a sampling effect - fig .  [",
    "fig : tu1 ] shows that the _ relative _ amount of light that originates from clusters , relative to the general field population , increases as a function of @xmath36 and . a similar result regarding surface brightness and the fraction of uv light in clusters",
    "was also noted by meurer et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a number of starburst galaxies , but over a smaller range in surface brightness .",
    "no correlation between  and the @xmath84 colour is seen , but this may not be quite as surprising since the @xmath84 colour index has a less clear physical interpretation and is , in any case , severely affected by absorption effects .    there is also some correlation between  and the  flux ratio , which measures the dust temperature and can therefore be taken as a measure of the intensity of the radiation field in a galaxy ( soifer et al .",
    "@xcite ) . the radiation field might play a role for the formation of bound clusters by keeping proto - cluster clouds in thermal equilibrium and delaying thermal instabilities , thereby preventing star formation from setting in too early and disrupting the clouds ( murray & lin @xcite ) .",
    "however , a high  ratio follows naturally from a high global fir luminosity ( soifer et al .",
    "@xcite ) , and the correlation between  and  does not by itself provide any evidence that the radiation field is a dominating factor in determining whether ymcs can form in a galaxy .",
    "thermal instabilities might be prevented in other ways , particularly by magnetic pressure support ( see e.g. mouschovias @xcite ) .",
    "the fir luminosity itself is an indicator of the current sfr through heating of dust grains by young stars ( kennicutt @xcite ) .",
    "the uncertainties on the exact relation are , however , considerable and a single calibration is unlikely to apply to all galaxies over a wide range in morphological type .",
    "this is mainly because older stellar populations also contribute to dust heating , and the ratio of current to past star formation varies along the hubble sequence .",
    "of course , the fir luminosity also suffers the same imf dependence as any other sfr indicator . here",
    "we will use the calibration by buat & xu ( @xcite ) which is claimed to be reasonably accurate for galaxies later than type sab , noting that it may overestimate the sfr in starburst galaxies by about a factor of 2 ( kennicutt @xcite ) : @xmath89 where  is the far - infrared luminosity ( in j / sec ) .",
    "we obtain from the  magnitudes in table  [ tab : intdata ] and the distance moduli , using the relation @xmath90 with @xmath91 being the far - infrared flux density , based on iras @xmath86 and @xmath87 flux densities ( see rc3 for details ) . from ( [ eq : sfr ] ) and ( [ eq : mfir_sfir ] ) , @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the distance in pc .    however , the global sfr is not likely to tell us much because of the large range in galaxy size and total luminosity .",
    "we therefore normalise the sfr to the area of each galaxy based on the _ optical _ diameter ( using @xmath40 from rc3 ) , defining  as the sfr per kpc@xmath94 : @xmath95 it might seem more reasonable to normalise to some area traced by the fir luminosity , but the resolution of the iras data does not allow this in all cases .",
    "another possibility would be to normalise to the optical luminosity rather than the area , but in this way some information might be lost because the optical luminosity is also correlated with the sfr , and because of the contribution from the bulge / halo components .",
    "[ fig : sfr_p1 ] displays  as a function of the host galaxy sfr according to eq .",
    "[ eq : sfr ] ( top panel ) and  ( bottom panel ) .",
    "a correlation is evident in both cases , but the scatter clearly decreases when plotting  as a function of  rather than the global sfr .",

    "again we see the poor fit of ngc  1569 into an otherwise quite good correlation , while ngc  1741 is located to the far right in the diagram , as expected from its high  value .",
    "ngc  1569 and ngc  1705 differ from the other cluster - rich galaxies by their relatively low absolute luminosities , and one could speculate that ymc formation might be due to a different physical mechanism in these galaxies . in fig .",

    "thus the main cause for the high  values of ngc  1705 and ngc  1569 still appears to be their relatively high level of star formation activity , and the poor fit of these two galaxies into the    relation may be ascribed primarily to the small number statistics of their cluster systems .",
    "our data apparently indicate that the formation efficiency of ymcs in galaxies is closely linked to the star formation activity . by using @xmath0-band luminosities ,",
    "the derived specific luminosities are dominated by the youngest stars , effectively making  a measure of the relative fraction of stars that currently form in massive clusters",
    ".  increases from about 0.1 in the most cluster - poor galaxies to 15 or more in merger galaxies like ngc  3256 .",
    "we can , of course , not exclude the possibility that some of the very youngest objects are unbound associations that will not survive for long , rather than bound clusters .",
    "however , as shown in paper1 , the age distributions of the clusters are generally quite smooth , indicating that at least some fraction of the objects are indeed gravitationally bound star clusters , orders of magnitudes older than their crossing times ( larsen @xcite ) .",
    "the  vs.  correlation may explain why ymcs have , so far , been noticed predominantly in late - type galaxies ( kennicutt & chu @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the small number of nearby , early - type spirals , this may just be an effect of the general increase in sfr along the hubble sequence .",
    "however , there is a large scatter in sfr at any given morphological type ( kennicutt @xcite ) , which is presumably also the reason for the corresponding scatter in , and we would expect ymcs to be abundant also in sa and sb galaxies with a sufficiently high  ( that is , higher than about @xmath111  yr@xmath112 kpc@xmath113 , fig .  [ fig : sfr_p1 ] ) .",
    "the main point here is that  correlates with the sfr , rather than that formation of ymcs is generally favoured in late - type galaxies .",
    "our data imply a continuum of  values , varying smoothly with , rather than a division of galaxies into those that contain ymcs and those that do not . that ymcs have often been considered as a special class of objects which only exist in certain galaxies , probably arises from the fact that most efforts to detect them have focused on starburst galaxies , where they are much more numerous .",
    "table  [ tab : bprop ] also shows that the @xmath114 of the brightest cluster in each galaxy varies significantly .",
    "recent , deep studies of young clusters in ngc  3256 ( zepf et al .",
    "@xcite ) , ngc  1275 ( carlson et al .",
    "@xcite ) and other galaxies have not revealed any clear indications of a turn - over in the cluster luminosity function down to @xmath115 or so , so the fact that these galaxies contain brighter clusters than less cluster - rich systems may just be a statistical effect .",
    "there does not seem to be any sfr threshold for formation of ymcs .",
    "instead , the number of ymcs formed and the efficiency of ymc formation appear to increase steadily with the star formation rate .",
    "this also raises the question whether massive star clusters are good tracers of the star formation history in a galaxy , as they have often been used in the magellanic clouds .",
    "for example , the apparent lack of massive star clusters in the lmc in the age range 4  10 gyr ( girardi et al .",
    "@xcite ) has been seen as an indication that the lmc was in a sort of `` hibernating '' state during this period . however , if the cluster formation efficiency depends upon the star formation rate as suggested by this paper , then the `` gap '' in the lmc cluster age distribution could merely represent an epoch where star formation proceeded at a somewhat slower , but not necessarily vanishing rate .",
    "indeed , this has been recently demonstrated from field star studies by dirsch et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it still remains to be explained _ why _ the formation of ymcs is correlated with the star formation rate .",
    "it is not even clear if ymcs form because there is a high sfr , or if the  ",
    "correlation is a consequence of some underlying mechanism that regulates both the sfr and the formation of ymcs .",
    "here we briefly discuss both possibilities in a speculative manner , and consider how they may complement each other .",
    "an underlying parameter controlling both the star formation rate and the ability to form bound , massive clusters could be the _",
    "mean _ gas density .",
    "it is well established that the sfr in a galaxy scales with some power of the gas density . denoting the total gas surface density , the schmidt ( @xcite ) law",
    "may be written as @xmath116 , where the exponent @xmath2 has a value close to 1.4 ( kennicutt @xcite ) .",
    "as shown by kennicutt ( @xcite ) , the schmidt law provides a surprisingly good description of the sfr in galaxies in terms of a global  over a wide range of surface gas density , so there is hope that cluster formation may depend on similar global galaxy properties , at least to a first approximation .",
    "the    relation in combination with the schmidt law implies that  should scale with  as well .",
    "this is at least partly confirmed by the observed correlation between  and the hi gas surface density ,  ( figs .",
    "[ fig : sbm21_p1 ] and [ fig : sbm21 ] ) .",
    "a     relation may follow from the fact that a higher gas density leads to a generally higher ism pressure ( @xmath117 where @xmath118 is the pressure , elmegreen @xcite ) .",
    "the ism pressure has been suggested to be one of the dominant parameters governing the formation of strongly bound clusters ( elmegreen & efremov @xcite ) and acts by producing proto - cluster clouds with higher binding energies , thus preventing them from dispersing too easily once star formation sets in .",
    "the clouds will have higher densities so that recombination rates are higher , and smaller fractions of the gas will be ionized by massive stars .",
    "also the dispersive power of stellar winds and supernovae will be lower in a high density environment .",
    "all these effects promote a high star formation efficiency , one of the necessary conditions to produce a bound cluster .    a    relation",
    "may thus be explained by saying that the high gas density delivers the required high pressure to form massive clusters . as",
    "local fluctuations are always important , we do not expect an overall `` threshold '' gas density when averaging over a whole galaxy , but as  increases , the number of regions with the required high density will gradually increase too and naturally lead to the formation of more strongly bound clusters . with a high one also expects a fast growth of the protocluster so that higher masses become plausible .",
    "the main effect of a high sfr is to pump energy into the ism .",
    "can this energy be responsible of creating suitable conditions for globular clusters ? according to elmegreen & efremov ( @xcite ) , globular cluster formation needs highly efficient star formation in a high pressure environment .    in order to form a massive , bound cluster two timescales",
    "apparently are of importance : the timescale for formation of a cloud core , which is massive enough to host a massive cluster , , and the time scale for ( high - mass ) star formation in the cloud core , .",
    "it is interesting to note that the _ average _ density of a proto - ymc cloud prior to the onset of star formation ( if the radius of the cluster equals the radius of the proto - cluster cloud ) @xmath119 must be quite similar to that observed in cluster - forming clumps in galactic giant molecular clouds ( lada et al .",
    "@xcite ) , although the total mass is much larger . in the milky way , efficient cluster formation appears to take place only in massive , high - density cloud cores , but not in _ all _ such cores ( lada et al .",
    "a discriminating factor appears to be the degree of fragmentation within the core , presumably because star formation takes place only in regions with a density higher than @xmath120 molecules per @xmath121 , or about @xmath122 .",
    "if such a critical density exists , one could understand  as the timescale which is needed for the gas to reach this density .    whatever the formation mechanism of the cloud core is ( elmegreen @xcite ) ,",
    "star formation may not commence early , because the returned energy from massive stars by radiation , outflows and stellar winds presumably will terminate the growth of the cloud core and moreover is a threat to its dynamic stability . if @xmath123 , the result might be a low mass cluster .",
    "in addition , @xmath124 may not vary strongly in the cloud core .",
    "if it did so , one expects the outcome again to be not a globular cluster , but a star forming region with many dynamically distinct smaller clusters .",
    "i.e. a configuration resembling an association .",
    "however , if @xmath125 , the cloud core can grow undisturbed by star formation and develop towards a strongly bound state .",
    "this may be the case either if the onset of star formation is somehow delayed , or if the formation of the proto - cluster cloud proceeds rapidly .",
    "any attempt to construct a scenario is hampered by the fact that even the physical cause for the onset of star formation ( e.g. ambipolar diffusion , jeans instabilities , thermal instabilities ) is not yet clearly identified .",
    "however , star formation in general means to put matter into a state of strongly negative potential energy , so there is demand for an external energy input to delay star formation , even if the exact process is not known .",
    "part of the required energy may come from early low - mass star formation within the cloud ( tan @xcite ) , but in order to maintain energy equilibrium in a large , massive cloud , external heat sources might also be necessary . at the highest densities ( @xmath126 ) the thermal pressure may become able to compete with or even dominate over magnetic pressure ( pringle @xcite ) , so an energy input may also prevent premature star formation by jeans or thermal instability ( murray & lin @xcite ) .",
    "a high overall star formation rate naturally provides a number of energy sources , not only in the form of radiation from massive stars .",
    "other possibilities are supersonic motions in the gas , induced by supernova shells or stellar winds .",
    "these may also help to compress proto - cluster clouds , so that large amounts of gas can be collected at high densities more easily , and fast enough to form a bound cluster .",
    "there is , in fact , some evidence that the formation of massive clusters marks the culmination of episodes of vivid star formation ( larson @xcite ) .",
    "these arguments apply not exclusively to massive clusters , but it is conceivable that more extreme external conditions can lead to denser , more massive clusters .",
    "this is in good agreement with the observed continuous dependence of  on .      within the scenarios described above",
    ", some findings regarding the systematics of globular clusters in early - type galaxies become understandable .",
    "the relevant labels can be called `` hot '' and `` cold '' dynamical environments .",
    "cluster formation in orderly rotating gaseous disks , a `` cold '' dynamical environment , may not be supported without the impact of a high star formation rate . in the dynamically `` hot '' bulges and halos ,",
    "the external energy supply comes from turbulent motions in the ambient medium which acts as a reservoir .",
    "a striking feature regarding cluster populations in elliptical galaxies is the high specific frequency of central galaxies in clusters like m87 and ngc 1399 . at least in the case of ngc  1399 , these can be understood by the early infall of a population of dwarf galaxies into the fornax cluster ( hilker et al .",
    "the infall velocities are of the order hundreds of km / s and the kinematic situation is similar to those in starburst galaxies .",
    "a lot of energy can by dissipated and very suitable conditions for cluster formation are provided .",
    "the same interpretation may be valid for the relation between the specific frequency of globular cluster systems and the environmental galaxy density of the host galaxies ( west @xcite ) : the higher the galaxy density , the more frequent galaxy interaction with violent star formation must have been , leading to higher cluster formation efficiencies .",
    "this might have been generally the case in the very early universe , when the average star formation rates were much higher than nowadays .",
    "the old halo globular cluster systems of `` normal '' galaxies , which belong to the oldest stellar populations in galaxies , have been formed during this period , which quite naturally provided suitable conditions for massive cluster formation .",
    "we have studied the cluster systems of the 21 galaxies in the sample of larsen & richtler ( @xcite ) together with literature data for some additional galaxies .",
    "it has been demonstrated that the specific @xmath0-band luminosity of the cluster systems ,  ( eq .  ( [ eq : tu ] ) )",
    "correlates with host galaxy parameters indicative of the star formation rate , in particular the surface brightness ( @xmath36 ) and iras far - infrared fluxes . using the fir fluxes to derive star formation rates ( sfr ) and obtaining the area - normalised sfr ( )",
    ", we find an even stronger correlation with , which seems to indicate that the formation of ymcs is favoured in environments with active star formation .",
    "however , this does not imply that ymcs form only in bona - fide starbursts , but rather that the cluster formation efficiency as measured by  increases steadily with and that the formation of ymcs in starbursts and mergers may just be extreme cases of a more general phenomenon .    we have also compared the  values with integrated hi gas surface densities ( ) and",
    "find a correlation here as well .",
    "since  and  are correlated , this is an expected consequence of the fact that  scales with some power of the gas surface density ( kennicutt @xcite ) .",
    "although the two amorphous dwarfs and have rather high  values for their star formation rates , we do not see any examples of _ cluster - poor _ galaxies with a _ high _ .",
    "in other words , a galaxy contains large numbers of ymcs whenever  is high enough , although the physical relation is not yet well understood .",
    "formation of a rich cluster system does not require a strong spiral density wave , for example , since the flocculent galaxy has a high .",
    "interaction with nearby neighbours does not appear to be necessary either , as illustrated by which has been labeled `` the less disturbed galaxy in the local universe '' ( karachentsev et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but nevertheless contains a rich population of ymcs .",
    "some mechanisms were outlined which may explain why massive star clusters form at a high efficiency in environments with a high sfr : a generally high sfr acts as an energy source that keeps molecular clouds in an equilibrium state and allows massive clouds to contract to a high density before high - mass star formation sets in . once the required high average density to form a ymc is reached ( about @xmath127 @xmath128 ) , star formation proceeds rapidly and at a high efficiency within the clouds , because the high pressure in the ambient medium keeps the proto - cluster clouds from dispersing ( elmegreen & efremov @xcite ) .",

    "<S> we present an analysis of correlations between integrated properties of galaxies and their populations of young massive star clusters . </S>",
    "<S> data for 21 nearby galaxies presented by larsen & richtler ( @xcite ) are used together with literature data for 10 additional galaxies , spanning a range in specific @xmath0-band cluster luminosity  from 0 to 15 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that  correlates with several observable host galaxy parameters , in particular the ratio of far - infrared ( fir ) to flux and the surface brightness . </S>",
    "<S> taking the fir luminosity as an indicator of the star formation rate ( sfr ) , it is found that  correlates very well with the sfr per unit area . </S>",
    "<S> a similar correlation is seen between  and the atomic hydrogen surface density . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster formation efficiency seems to depend on the sfr in a continuous way , rather than being related to any particularly violent mode of star formation . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss fundamental features of possible scenarios for cluster formation . </S>",
    "<S> one possibility is that the correlation between  and sfr is due to a common controlling parameter , most probably the high density of the ism . </S>",
    "<S> another scenario conceives a high  as resulting from the energy input from many massive stars in case of a high sfr . </S>"
