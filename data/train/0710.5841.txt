    "the main interest in the double beta decay is connected with the neutrinoless mode ( @xmath7-decay ) as a probe for physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions .",
    "the detection of double beta decay with emission of two neutrinos ( @xmath0-decay ) , which is an allowed process of second order in the sm , provides the possibility for experimental determination of the corresponding nuclear matrix elements ( nme s ) . at present",
    ", @xmath0-decay has been measured for ten nuclei @xcite .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a subject of interest is the single state dominance ( ssd ) hypothesis proposed by abad et al .",
    "@xcite some times ago .",
    "it was suggested that @xmath0-decays with @xmath3 ground state of the intermediate nucleus ( e.g. , a=100 , 116 and 128 nuclear systems ) are solely determined by the two virtual @xmath8-transitions : ( i ) the first one connecting the ground state of the initial nucleus with @xmath9 intermediate state ; ( ii ) the second one proceeding from the @xmath9 state to the final ground state",
    ". an alternative higher state dominance ( hsd ) approach assumes that high - lying energy states of the intermediate nucleus give the main contribution to the @xmath0-decay nmes . in this case",
    "the sum of the two lepton energies in the denominators of the nmes can be replaced with their average value @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been pointed out that the @xmath0-decay allows to investigate also particle properties , in particular whether the pauli exclusion principle is violated for neutrinos , and thus , neutrinos obey at least partly the bose - einstein statistics @xcite . for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath10 and @xmath11",
    "results of numerical calculations of the total rates and various distributions were presented in @xcite .",
    "currently , much attention is paid to the double beta decay of @xmath1 due to a large q - value and low background from natural radioactivity .",
    "this isotope is considered to be a proper candidate for planed supernemo , dcba(drift chamber beta - ray analyzer ) and sno+ experiments . in this contribution",
    "two problems are addressed : can the ssd hypothesis be confirmed or ruled out for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 ?",
    "is it possible to study also the violation of the pauli exclusion principle for neutrinos in this process ?",
    "till now the issue of the ssd hypothesis has been not addressed in the case of the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 as the ground state of the intermediate nucleus is @xmath2 state .",
    "it looks simply unlikely that the ssd is realized through forbidden ec and @xmath12-decay , nevertheless , this issue has not been checked yet .",
    "however , a negative energy difference between the initial @xmath1 and the intermediate @xmath4 ground states favors this nuclear system for the ssd / hsd analysis via differential characteristics .",
    "@xmath15    @xmath16    nuclear matrix elements can be written as @xmath17 with @xmath18 @xmath19 here , @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath21 , @xmath22 are energies of the initial and final nuclei , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the axial - vector coupling constant ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "r is nuclear radius .",
    "further we assume that the nuclear matrix element for ec of the ground state @xmath4 is comparable with that for @xmath12-decay of this isotope .",
    "both matrix elements are suppressed by the same coulombic factor ( @xmath25 ) and a similar situation occurs also for a=100 system ( see table [ tab.pol ] ) @xcite . under this assumption",
    "we find the half - life of the ec of @xmath4 to be about @xmath26 years , i.e. , not measurable with help of current technologies .",
    "the ssd prediction for the @xmath0-decay half - life is @xmath27 years in complete disagreement with the experimental value @xmath28 years @xcite .",
    "we recall that for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath11 there is a rather good agreement between the ssd calculated value @xmath29 years and the measured value @xmath30 years .    in fig .",
    "[ picture1 ] we present the single electron differential decay rate for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath11 and @xmath1 to @xmath31 ground state and @xmath32 excited state .",
    "the ssd results were obtained by assuming the dominance of transition through @xmath3 ground state of @xmath13 and @xmath2 ground state of @xmath4 for @xmath0-decay of @xmath11 and @xmath1 , respectively .",
    "we see that differences between the ssd and hsd predictions are even larger for a=150 as for a=100 .",
    "unlike there is an unknown @xmath3 low lying state of @xmath4 the experimental measurement should confirm the hsd results for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 .",
    "this spectroscopic problem can be also addressed by measuring ( @xmath33 ) charge exchange reaction on @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the recent progress in the field of charge exchange reactions is encouraging and provide new and sometimes unexpected insight into nuclear structure phenomena .",
    "neutrinos may possibly violate the spin - statistics theorem , and hence obey bose statistics or mixed statistics despite having spin half @xcite .",
    "a violation of the spin - statistics relation for neutrinos would lead to a number of observable effects in cosmology and astrophysics . in particular , bosonic neutrinos might compose all or a part of the cold cosmological dark matter ( through bosonic condensate of neutrinos ) and simultaneously provide some hot dark matter @xcite .",
    "a change of neutrino statistics would have an impact on the evolution of supernovae and on the spectra of supernova neutrinos .",
    "the pauli principle violation for neutrinos can be tested in the @xmath0-decay @xcite .",
    "= 0.9 = 0.4    qualitative features of the @xmath0-decay in the presence of bosonic neutrinos can be understood by the fact that two contributions to the amplitude of the decay from diagram with permuted neutrino momenta have relative plus sign instead of minus in the fermi - dirac case .",
    "the decay probability is proportional to the bilinear combinations @xmath34 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where @xmath36 here , @xmath21 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the energies of the initial nucleus , intermediate nucleus , electrons and neutrinos , respectively .",
    "we notice a sign difference between the two energy denominators in ( [ prop ] ) distinguishing the cases of fermionic ( f ) and bosonic ( b ) neutrinos .",
    "the effect of bosonic neutrinos is different for transitions to @xmath31 ground states and @xmath41 excited states .",
    "it is because the decay rate to @xmath31 state is governed by the combinations @xmath42 and decay rate to @xmath41 state is proportional to combinations @xmath43 . by approximating these combinations",
    "one finds significantly different expressions for bosonic and fermionic neutrinos : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the average energy of the leptonic pair .    in fig .",
    "[ picture2 ] we show the energy distributions of outgoing electrons calculated for the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 to the @xmath46 ground state and @xmath32 excited state with the hsd assumption . both for the single electron differential decay rate ( left panel ) and for differential decay rate as function of the sum of kinetic energy of outgoing electrons ( right panel )",
    "the results are significantly different for bosonic and fermionic neutrinos .",
    "in particular , maxima of the distributions for transitions to @xmath46 and @xmath32 states ( right panel ) are about at the same position for fermionic neutrinos and are shifted each to other by about 0.5 mev for bosonic neutrinos .",
    "we offered some arguments that the ssd hypothesis is not expected to be realized for @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 .",
    "this might be confirmed within the nemo 3 and supernemo experiments .",
    "however , if there is an unknown low - lying @xmath3 state of @xmath4 the conclusion might be opposite",
    ". this issue can be addressed by the ( d,@xmath5 ) charge - exchange experiment on @xmath6 target @xcite .",
    "in addition , we showed that a study of the @xmath0-decay of @xmath1 can provide a sensitive test of the pauli exclusion principle and statistics of neutrinos .",
    "for that purpose an experiment ( e.g. , supernemo ) is needed with a precision measurement of differential characteristics for @xmath0-decay transitions to @xmath31 ground and @xmath32 excited states .          9 a.s .",
