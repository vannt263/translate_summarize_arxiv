    "<S> we present a _ mathematica _ interface for handling the parton distribution functions of the nndpf collaboration , available from the nnpdf hepforge website  http://nnpdf.hepforge.org/. as a case study we briefly summarise the first pdf set which includes all relevant lhc data , nnpdf2.3 , and demonstrate the use of our new _ </S>",
    "<S> mathematica _ interface .    </S>",
    "<S> parton distribution functions , nnpdf , _ mathematica _    </S>",
    "<S> we have developed a _ </S>",
    "<S> mathematica _ </S>",
    "<S> package which provides direct interactive access to any nnpdf parton set . </S>",
    "<S> this package reads the nnpdf lhgrid files as available from the lhapdf library and performs their interpolation in ( @xmath0,@xmath1 ) space by means of proper _ mathematica _ built - in functions . </S>",
    "<S> the user can therefore make use of pdf ensembles within a _ mathematica _ notebook in order to compute observables , evaluate pdf central values and variances and plot pdfs instantaneously . in this note </S>",
    "<S> we shall present a brief motivation and summary of the key features present in the new nnpdf2.3  @xcite pdf set , and demonstrate the nnpdf _ mathematica _ package by examining this new determination .    in recent years </S>",
    "<S> the volume of collider data of application in the accurate determination of parton distribution functions has significantly increased . </S>",
    "<S> previous pdf determinations based solely upon high energy collider data collected by tevatron and hera collaborations were poorly constrained in comparison to global fits including data from fixed target deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan experiments . </S>",
    "<S> these collider only determinations are of particular interest in that they are free from the potential issues arising from nuclear corrections and higher twist effects present in the low energy data of global fits . studying the impact of lhc data upon pdf determinations is therefore crucial not only for further constraint upon global determinations , but also for their potential utility in providing competitive collider only fits .    </S>",
    "<S> the nnpdf2.2 parton set  @xcite was the first determination to investigate the constraining power of lhc measurements upon parton distributions , specifically the @xmath2 lepton charge asymmetry measurements of the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations in addition to the d0 collaboration measurements  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this data was included by taking advantage of the monte carlo uncertainty estimation in the nnpdf methodology . </S>",
    "<S> nnpdf sets provide a probability distribution in the space of pdfs allowing for the use of a bayesian reweighting technique @xcite and the rapid inclusion of new datasets into a prior set . </S>",
    "<S> however , this method is limited to the inclusion of a relatively small dataset .    in order to include an updated and more comprehensive lhc dataset into an nnpdf fit , an extremely fast method of collider observable computation has been developed . </S>",
    "<S> the fastkernel method for hadronic observables  @xcite combines the monte carlo weight grids from fast nlo software packages such as applgrid  @xcite and fastnlo  @xcite , with fastkernel pdf evolution tables  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting fastkernel table may then be combined with the initial scale parton distributions to produce the required observable . </S>",
    "<S> for a given hadronic observable @xmath3 the operation required to compute the theoretical prediction for such an observable is simply , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the final fastkernel table and the @xmath6 are the initial scale , dglap evolution basis parton distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the indices @xmath7 , @xmath8 run over the @xmath9 points in the fitting scale @xmath0-grid , and @xmath10 , @xmath11 run over the reduced flavour basis of @xmath12 light pdfs at this initial scale . </S>",
    "<S> this operation is computationally very simple and allows for a much accelerated fit .    with this method </S>",
    "<S> we are able to add a relatively large lhc dataset to the existing data in the nnpdf 2.1 family to produce a set of fits denoted nnpdf 2.3 . </S>",
    "<S> the nnpdf2.3 lhc dataset includes atlas collaboration @xmath13 @xmath14 measurements of the inclusive jet cross section  @xcite and electroweak vector boson rapidity distributions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the cms collaboration s @xmath15 @xmath14 measurement of the w electron asymmetry  @xcite and the lhcb w boson rapidity distribution data  @xcite are included also . </S>",
    "<S> the expanded kinematic reach of the nnpdf2.3 dataset is described in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : kin ] . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the inclusion of the lhc data , the nnpdf2.3 family of fits features a number of methodological improvements .        </S>",

    "<S> we have used our new _ mathematica _ interface to draw these plots . from fig .  </S>",

    "<S> in particular , this allows to perform a variety of manipulations on pdfs in a straightforward and interactive way , as we briefly demonstrate in the following discussion .    * </S>",
    "<S> * compute pdf central value and variance * we have defined proper functions to keep the computation of pdf central value and variance very easy . </S>",

    "<S> * make pdf plots * _ mathematica _ enables a wide range of plotting options . as a few examples , we show the 3d plot and the contour plot of the singlet pdf from the nlo nnpdf2.3 parton set ( see figs .  </S>",
