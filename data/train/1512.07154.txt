    "the latter expression is single -valued on the surface and therefore differs by a constant factor from the projection @xmath73 .",
    "this factor may be found if we evaluate both functions at @xmath77 .",
    "the resulting expression may be simplified by the usage of theta charachteristics .",

    "to make this formula computationally effective one has to calculate the period matrix @xmath19 and the image of infinity in the jacobian @xmath79 .",

    "see e.g. techniques developed in @xcite .",
    "the latter approach is in particular useful in the cases close to degenerateones when the segments of @xmath0 tend to vanish or merge .",
