    "the qcd phase diagram , as it is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : phasediag ] , contains a variety of theoretically predicted features .",
    "the most important one is the phase boundary separating a hadron gas and a quark gluon plasma ( red dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag ] ) .",
    "its position at vanishing baryonic chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) is defined by the critical temperature @xmath1 .",
    "even though recent attempts to calculate the exact value of @xmath1 with lattice qcd still result in different numerical values @xcite , there is a general consensus that for @xmath0 this transition is of the type of crossover .",
    "however , this crossover line might turn for a certain @xmath2  into a first order phase transition , which would result in a critical point at that position @xcite .",
    "however , predictions on the location of the critical point are still very uncertain @xcite",
    ". it might very well be that it does not exist at all @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been conjectured that the phase diagram might contain yet another phase , the so - called quarkyonic phase @xcite , which would be separated from normal hadronic matter by a different phase boundary line ( blue dashed line in fig .  [",
    "fig : phasediag ] ) .",
    "experimentally , there are several control parameters available that might allow to study different regions of the phase diagram with heavy ion collisions .",
    "one is the variation of the center - of - mass energy which will force the reaction systems to follow different trajectories in the @xmath3-@xmath2  plane , reflected by a change of the chemical freeze - out parameters .",
    "the second control parameter is the variation of the system size , which can either be achieved by performing central collisions of nuclei of different size , or by studying centrality selected minimum bias collisions .",
    "however , whether this can be considered as a good control parameter for probing different areas of the phase diagram shall be discussed further below .        in the following we review some results from systematic studies of particle production in heavy ion collisions performed at the cern - sps , and will discuss what can be learned from existing data on the experimental accessibility of different areas in the phase diagram .",
    "finally , we also present some results from existing attempts to search for a critical point .",
    "recent results on rapidity spectra of ( anti-)protons in central pb+pb reactions , measured at energies between 20@xmath4 - 158  at the sps @xcite , together with central au+au data from the ags @xcite and rhic @xcite allow to study the energy evolution of stopping .",
    "based on the measured rapidity spectra for p , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , all corrected for feed down from weak decays , the net - baryon distributions @xmath10 have been constructed @xcite .",
    "the contribution of unmeasured baryons ( n , @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) was estimated using the results of a statistical hadron gas model @xcite . in the sps energy region a clear evolution of the shape can be observed ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : edep_baryons ] ) , changing from a single maximum at midrapidity towards a structure with two maxima and a dip at @xmath13 .",
    "concurring with this evolution , also a strong change of the anti - baryon / baryon ratios takes place in the energy region of the sps @xcite and thus of the baryonic chemical potential at freeze - out @xmath2 .    around mid - rapidity of @xmath6 ,",
    "@xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , divided by the total pion rapidity densities ( ) for central pb+pb and au+au collisions @xcite . also shown",
    "are results for the transport models urqmd1.3",
    "( dashed line ) @xcite and hsd ( dotted line ) @xcite , as well as a statistical hadron gas model ( solid line ) @xcite . ]    around mid - rapidity of @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , divided by the total pion rapidity densities ( ) for central pb+pb and au+au collisions @xcite .",
    "also shown are results for the transport models urqmd1.3",
    "( dashed line ) @xcite and hsd ( dotted line ) @xcite , as well as a statistical hadron gas model ( solid line ) @xcite . ]    the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : edep_baryons ] shows a comparison of the energy dependence of mid - rapidity @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9  production to several models .",
    "while the transport models urqmd1.3 @xcite and hsd @xcite provide a reasonable description of the @xmath6/@xmath14 and @xmath7/@xmath14 ratios , they are clearly below the data points in case of the @xmath8  and @xmath9 .",
    "this might indicate that an additional partonic contribution is necessary to reach the production rates observed for multi - strange particles .",
    "statistical models on the other hand , generally provide a better match to the data .",
    "these models are based on the assumption that the particle yields correspond to their chemical equilibrium value and can thus be described by the parameters temperature @xmath3 , baryonic chemical potential @xmath2 , volume @xmath15 , and , in some implementations , by an additional strangeness under - saturation factor @xmath16 .",
    "the curves shown in the right panel of fig .  [ fig : edep_baryons ] , labeled shm(b ) , are taken from @xcite and are based on parametrizations of the @xmath17  dependence of @xmath3 and @xmath2 , assuming @xmath16  =  1 .",
    "the results of various analysis of the measured particle abundances with statistical model approaches show that @xmath3 and @xmath2  parameter for the sps energy range vary over a wide region , following an universal freeze - out curve @xcite , and might be in the vicinity of the possible critical point location @xcite .",
    "thus , the variation of @xmath17   provides a well defined way of selecting different regions in the @xmath3-@xmath2  plane .",
    "recent data on proton and antiproton production in minimum bias pb+pb reactions allow to study the system size dependence of stopping .",
    "figure  [ fig : net_protons ] shows the net - proton rapidity distributions for five different centrality classes , selected from minimum bias pb+pb interactions at 40@xmath4 ( left panel ) and 158  ( right panel ) @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of this data is that there is no drastic change with centrality of the shapes of the distributions inside the measured region at 158 .",
    "however , at 40  the shapes of the distributions change with centrality , going from a two - maxima structure with a narrow dip at midrapidity for central collisions to a shallow valley like distribution for peripheral collisions , similar as observed at the ags @xcite .",
    "( left ) and 158  ( right ) for different centralities as measured by the na49 experiment @xcite .",

    "the full symbols represent the measurements .",
    "the open symbols are reflected at midrapidity . ]",
    "the @xmath5/p  ratio , being directly sensitive to the baryonic chemical potential @xmath2 , depends much less on system size than it does depend on energy .",
    "while for the mid - rapidity ratios at 158  only a change in the order of a factor of two is observed when comparing central pb+pb reactions ( @xmath5/p = 0.56 , 0  5% most central ) to very peripheral ones ( @xmath5/p = 0.11 for 43  100% ) , this ratio varies by a factor of 43 between central pb+pb collisions at 20  ( @xmath5/p = 0.0013 , 0  7% ) and 158  @xcite .",
    "thus , only a small variation of @xmath2  can be achieved when studying reactions of different system sizes .",
    "it has been found that the core - corona approach is able to describe the system size dependence of particle production reasonable well @xcite . in this model",
    "a nucleus - nucleus collision is decomposed into a central core , which corresponds to the large fireball produced in central a+a collisions , and a peripheral corona , that is equivalent to independent nucleon - nucleon reactions . to quantify the relative contribution of the two components ,",
    "the fraction of nucleons that scatter more than once @xmath18 can be used .",
    "@xmath18 can simply be calculated with a glauber model @xcite .",
    "this quantity allows for a natural interpolation between the yields @xmath19 measured in elementary p+p ( @xmath20 ) and in central nucleus - nucleus collisions ( @xmath21 ) : @xmath22\\ ] ] the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanmt_vs_nw ] shows for example the result of this approach compared to the system size dependence of the strangeness enhancement factors @xmath23 at 158  @xcite . here",
    ", @xmath23 is defined relative to p+p reactions as baseline measurement : @xmath24 the observed rapid rise for very small systems and the subsequent saturation can naturally be described within this model .",
    "it is interesting to observe that this approach not only works for yields , but also for dynamical quantities such as the average transverse momenta @xmath25  ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : meanmt_vs_nw ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the core - corona approach in general provides a reasonable way for understanding the evolution from elementary p+p to central pb+pb collisions .",
    "values at mid - rapidity for pb+pb collisions at 40@xmath4 and 158 , as well as for near - central c+c and si+si reactions at 158  @xcite .",
    "the ( anti-)proton data are taken from @xcite . also shown are the results from a fit for @xmath6  and @xmath7  with the core - corona approach ( solid lines ) . ]",
    "values at mid - rapidity for pb+pb collisions at 40@xmath4 and 158 , as well as for near - central c+c and si+si reactions at 158  @xcite .",
    "the ( anti-)proton data are taken from @xcite .",
    "also shown are the results from a fit for @xmath6  and @xmath7  with the core - corona approach ( solid lines ) . ]",
    "a more differential look on the core - corona model is shown in the left panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : glauber ] for symmetric reaction systems . due to their different surface to volume ratio ,",
    "the @xmath26  dependence of @xmath18 is much steeper for smaller reaction systems than for larger ones are based on a function @xmath18 that was calculated for pb+pb interactions @xcite",
    ". therefore their direct comparison to the smaller systems c+c and si+si is not possible . ]",
    "also , the maximum value of @xmath18 depends on the size of the nuclei .",
    "e.g. , while for very central pb+pb collisions @xmath27 can be reached , the maximum value for very central c+c reactions is @xmath28 .",
    "this @xmath4 dependence of @xmath29 is illustrated by the dashed red line in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] .",
    "this has the consequence that the different relative core corona contributions have to be taken into account when comparing even very central nucleus - nucleus collisions of different size .",
    "especially , this might explain any apparent system size dependence of the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 , as determined by statistical model fits to central a+a collisions of different size ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that , assuming the core - corona model is valid , the system size might not provide a good control parameter to probe different regions of the qcd phase diagram with produced fireballs of different temperature .",
    "it is more likely that one only observes a change in the relative admixture of central fireball ( core ) and peripheral p+p like corona , whose freeze - out parameters are different , but independent of the size of the involved nuclei .     of participating nucleons that scatter more than once as a function of the number of participants @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath18 was calculated with a glauber model @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows results for symmetric systems , the right panel for asymmetric ones .",
    "the dashed lines connect the values for the most central collisions . ]     of participating nucleons that scatter more than once as a function of the number of participants @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath18 was calculated with a glauber model @xcite .",
    "the left panel shows results for symmetric systems , the right panel for asymmetric ones .",
    "the dashed lines connect the values for the most central collisions . ]",
    "another interesting aspect of the core - corona model is shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] . here , the @xmath26  dependence of @xmath18 is shown for asymmetric collisions . in this case",
    "quite distinct centrality dependences can be observed . while for symmetric collisions this dependence is following a continous rise ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : glauber ] ) , for asymmetric collision systems with a small projectile nucleus ( e.g. o+pb or si+pb ) a rapid rise followed by a maximum and a subsequent decrease of @xmath18 is seen .",
    "therefore , a similar centrality dependence of particle yields can be expected for these type of collisions and its measurement would constitute a test for the validity of the core - corona model .",
    "one of the observables proposed to be sensitive to the presence of a critical point in the qcd phase diagram are fluctuations of either mean transverse momentum or multiplicity @xcite .",
    "if the chemical freeze - out is happening in the vicinity of the critical point , an enhancement of fluctuations might be visible .",
    "the na49 experiment has therefore performed a systematic study of multiplicity fluctuations in very central ( 1% most central ) pb+pb collisions as a function of beam energy @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : multfluct ] shows the resulting scaled variance @xmath30 as a function of baryonic chemical potential @xmath2 , that has been derived from statistical model fits to the particle abundances measured at the different beam energies @xcite .    while for all charged particles taken together @xmath31 is close to unity , it is slightly below one for negatively and positively charged particles analyzed separately , i.e. the distributions are in these cases a bit narrower than the corresponding poissonian .",
    "however , in none of the studied charge combinations a significant energy dependence has been so far observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : multfluct ] also shows some theoretical expectations for @xmath31 , which result from the combination of several assumptions @xcite .",
    "the position of the critical point in terms of @xmath3 and @xmath2  is taken from a lattice qcd calculation @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the fluctuations at the critical point is based on @xcite , assuming two different correlation lengths @xmath32  fm ( solid line ) and @xmath33  fm ( dashed line ) , while the widths of the enhancements around the critical point has been chosen according to @xcite as @xmath34  mev .",
    "both predictions are at variance with the data , so that up to now there is no evidence for a critical point in fluctuation measurements .      another possible way of detecting a critical point has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "here it was shown that the proximity of a critical point , or rather a critical area , might deform the isentropic trajectories of an expanding fireball in the @xmath3-@xmath35  plane , due to a focussing effect towards the critical point . as a consequence",
    "one should see a decrease of the anti - baryon / baryon ratios with increasing transverse mass , while in the absence of a critical point this ratio should rather be flat as a function of @xmath36 .    the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : antib_b_spectra ] shows the @xmath5/p  ratio versus @xmath37  for five different beam energies @xcite . in order to quantify any change in transverse mass dependence ,",
    "a linear fit has been applied to the data .",
    "the @xmath7/@xmath6  and @xmath9/@xmath8  ratios have been analyzed in the same fashion .",
    "the resulting energy dependence of the slope parameters @xmath38 is summarized in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : antib_b_spectra ] . no significant energy dependence can be seen and thus this observable currently does not provide any evidence for a critical point .    , for the 1% most central pb+pb collisions in the forward rapidity region ( @xmath39 ) as measured by the na49 experiment @xcite .",
    "the different beam energies are represented by the corresponding @xmath2  values , determined by a statistical model fit @xcite .",
    "the lines correspond to predictions for for critical point ( see text ) . ]",
    "in order to probe different areas in the qcd phase diagram , the variation of the center - of - mass energy can be considered as the best defined control parameter . especially in the energy regime of the sps a wide region in the @xmath3-@xmath2  plane can be explored experimentally , as is evident from the strong dependence of the chemical freeze - out parameters on the energy here .",
    "the situation is much less well defined when using the system size as control parameter . since the system size dependences of many observables ( e.g. strangeness production and @xmath25 ) seem to be well described within the core - corona approach , it is unlikely that the freeze - out temperatures of the fireballs vary with their size .",
    "rather one observes a change of the relative admixture of the core and corona contributions .",
    "however , the trajectories of the fireballs in the core might be always the same , irrespective of their size .",
    "studying centrality dependences in asymmetric reaction systems could provide an additional experimental test of the core - corona model . in these cases",
    "this model predicts for smaller projectile nuclei a maximum in the relative core contribution for semi - central reactions , in contrast to symmetric reaction systems that reach the maximum for very central collisions .",
    "several attempts have been made to search within existing data for evidences of a critical point , such e.g. as fluctuations and the transverse mass dependence of anti - baryon / baryon ratios .",
    "so far non of these searches yielded a positive result .",
    "the success of future searches will on one side mainly depend on the development of more refined and differential ( i.e. scale and @xmath40  dependent ) observables , that allow to distinguish effects due to a critical point from more trivial sources . on the other side ,",
