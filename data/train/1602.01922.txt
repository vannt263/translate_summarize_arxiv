    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are very energetic sources powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in centers of their host galaxies . in optical / ultraviolet ( uv ) spectra of agns ,",
    "the most prominent features are plenty of broad emission lines whose full - width - half - maximum ( fwhm ) spans from @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "these emission lines originate from the gas in the broad - line regions ( blrs ) , which is photoionized by the continuum from central engines @xcite . in the past decades",
    ", reverberation mapping ( rm , e.g. , @xcite ) has become the mainstay in studying the kinematics and geometry of blrs , as well as in measuring the masses of smbhs in the centers of agns .",
    "it discerns the blrs in time domain , instead of spatially , by monitoring spectroscopically the response of broad emission lines to the variations of continuum fluxes .",
    "rm observation has been carried out for more than 50 agns by many different groups @xcite , and measures successfully their time delays between the variations of continuum and emission lines .",
    "enormous progress has been made in understanding the blrs through rm observations ( see recent reviews , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , a main objective of rm is to reconstruct the so - called velocity - delay map ( also known as  transfer function \" ) , which is a function of the time lag and line - of - sight velocity of blr gas , instead of only getting an averaged time lag of the emission line @xcite . due to the requirements of homogeneous sampling , accurate calibration ,",
    "excellent signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios and high resolution for the reconstruction of velocity - delay maps @xcite , a relatively simpler analysis , that measuring the time lags of emission line as a function of line - of - sight velocity ( velocity - resolved time lags ) , have been applied to about a dozen of agns ( e.g. , @xcite ) and reveal the kinematics and geometry of their blrs .",
    "it is very similar to the projection of velocity - delay map on the velocity axis .",
    "furthermore , some more recent works have recovered the velocity - delay maps in several agns successfully by maximum entropy methods @xcite or markov chain monte carlo method @xcite .",
    "since 2012 , we have started a large rm campaign to monitor a sample of agns with high accretion rates , especially super - eddington accreting massive black holes ( seambhs ) .",
    "the goal of the campaign is to understand better the super - eddington accretion onto black holes , the blr physics and their potential as a new probe of cosmological distance @xcite .",
    "the observations and light curves of h@xmath0 emission line in the first year ( 2012 - 2013 ) have been published in @xcite ( 2014 , hereafter paper i ) and @xcite ( 2014 , hereafter paper ii ) , and the time lags of their fe ii emission are presented in @xcite ( 2015 , hereafter paper iii ) . the second stage of the campaign ( 2013 - 2014 ) have also been published in @xcite ( 2015 , hereafter paper iv ) .",
    "these samples provide us opportunity to take a close look at the kinematics and geometry of the blrs in high accretion rate agns .",
    "in particular , the well - known blr radius - luminosity correlation ( @xmath4 relationship , see @xcite ) is reported to show some dependence on accretion rate ( paper iv ) , implying that the blrs are indeed different in agns with high accretion rates from the normal ones .",
    "this paper presents the velocity - resolved time lags of the sources in the first year of our seambh campaign .",
    "section [ sec : observation ] gives a short review of the observation and data reduction .",
    "section [ sec : correct ] describes in detail the deconvolution method we used to correct line - broadening caused by seeing and instruments , as well as a monte carlo simulation to evaluate the effectiveness of the correction . in this section ,",
    "we also show a comparison of the h@xmath0 profiles before and after the deconvolution procedures .",
    "the obtained velocity - resolved time lags are provided in section [ sec : timelags ] .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] gives a brief discussion and section [ sec : conclusion ] a summary of the new results .",
    "details of the target selection , the instruments , the observation and the procedures of data reduction of the campaign in 2012 - 2013 ( hereafter seambh2012 ) have been presented by paper i and ii . for completeness , in this section , we provide a brief summary of the main points .      the targets selected for seambh2012 are mainly narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s , see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which , as a peculiar group of agns , are suspected to be candidates of seambhs . the characteristics of nls1s are : 1 ) narrow balmer lines ( fwhm @xmath5 km s@xmath6 ) , 2 ) strong optical fe ii emission ( relative to @xmath7 ) , 3 ) weak [ o iii ]  lines and 4 ) steep hard x - ray spectrum @xcite .",
    "we selected nls1s with extremely steep 2@xmath110 kev continuum , which is known to anti - correlate with accretion rates ( wang et al .",
    "2004 ) . for the seambh2012 sample , we monitored nine nls1s successfully , whose names and coordinates are summarized in table 1 of paper ii .",
    "all of the spectroscopic observations were carried out with the yunnan faint object spectrograph and camera which is mounted on the lijiang 2.4-m telescope at the yunnan observatories of the chinese academy of sciences . to obtain spectra with highly accurate flux calibration",
    ", we oriented the long slit to take the spectra of the object and a nearby non - varying comparison star ( used as standard ) simultaneously .",
    "this method was applied to rm campaign early in @xcite and @xcite . in seambh2012",
    ", we fixed the slit width to 2.5 given the seeing conditions , and used grism 14 with a resolution of 92   mm@xmath6 and a wavelength coverage of 3800 - 7200  which yields @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) in dispersion direction finally .",
    "all of the spectroscopic data were reduced with iraf v2.16 and the flux was calibrated by comparing spectra of the targets with those of the comparison stars exposured in the slit .",

    "in spectroscopic observation , the line - broadening ( @xmath10 ) , which is caused by seeing and instruments ( e.g. , grism or grating ) , influences the observed profiles of emission lines .",
    "although the instrumental settings remain the same during observations , the seeing varies nights by nights ( fwhm of the point - spread functions in seambh2012 is generally from 1.2 to 2.5 , while the width of slit is fixed to 2.5 which is wider than seeing ) , and @xmath11 in each night changes as well .",
    "furthermore , the mis - centering of objects and comparison stars in the slit is not a constant in different nights .",
    "this causes that each spectrum have slightly different shift in dispersion direction .",
    "fortunately , we are also able to estimate the shifts from the spectra of comparison stars so that we can correct this automatically by deconvolution .",
    "the observed h@xmath0 profile of @xmath12 is a convolution of its intrinsic profile @xmath13 and the line - broadening function @xmath10 , namely @xmath14 variations of @xmath11 does not change the integrated flux of h@xmath0 emission line , however , it blurs @xmath15 and further influences the velocity - resolved time series analysis .",
    "it is thus expected to correct the line - broadening of h@xmath0 profiles before the velocity - resolved rm analysis , especially for those objects with relatively narrow h@xmath0 lines ( fwhm @xmath16 1000  2000km / s , comparing to the instrumental broadening of @xmath16500km / s estimated in paper i ) in our seambh2012 observation .",
    "fortunately , the spectra of comparison stars in the same slit during spectroscopic exposures can be employed to estimate @xmath10 accurately in light of that the fwhm of absorption lines in stellar spectra ( @xmath17 10 ) is much narrower than the line - broadening . an efficient way to perform",
    "such a correction is the well - known richardson - lucy algorithm @xcite which can deconvolve @xmath11 from @xmath18 so as to recover @xmath13 .",
    "figure [ fig : flowchart ] shows the sketch of procedures for line - broadening correction .",
    "we first estimate the broadening function @xmath11 of exposure via fitting the spectrum of comparison star in each night by a stellar template , then use the obtained @xmath11 to correct the broadening of h@xmath0 profile @xmath18 in the observed spectra through richardson - lucy deconvolution algorithm .",
    "finally , we can get the broadeing - corrected profile @xmath15 .",
    "richardson - lucy ( r - l ) deconvolution algorithm is a bayesian - based iterative technique commonly used for recovering signal blurred by a known response .",
    "it has been widely adopted to improve the spatial resolution of images from hubble space telescope ( _ hst _ , e.g. , @xcite and the references therein ) , and to correct the instrumental broadening in spectroscopic data such as ultraviolet spectra from goddard high resolution spectrograph on _ hst _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) or x - ray spectroscopy measurements of heavy elements @xcite .",
    "even recently , @xcite used it in data analysis of integral field spectrograph from gemini . to our knowledge",
    ", this is the first application of such technique to the correction of instrumental broadening in spectra from rm observation .",
    "we do not repeat the details of r - l deconvolution here , but just give a brief description ( readers may refer to original papers @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "it enables us to obtain @xmath11 of the object synchronously from the comparison star in the pair .",

    "prior to the fitting , the consecutive exposures of the object - star pair in each night are combined so as to provide high s / n ratio .",

    "the distributions of the broadening are similar to the case of mrk 335 , so we do not show them repeatedly here . it should be noted that , although seambhs generally have weak [ o iii]@xmath29 , we can still try to estimate @xmath11 from the [ o iii ]  line in several objects with relatively strong and intrinsicly narrow [ o iii ]  ( e.g. , mrk 382 ) by comparing its width to the value of spectra with higher resolution @xcite , if we assume the narrow lines do not vary with time . the @xmath11 obtained from [ o iii ]  is consistent with the values estimated by the fitting here , and the differences are @xmath30 km s@xmath6 averagely .    after getting @xmath11 in each night ( for each target )",

    ", we first construct an gaussian , with the same fwhm and equivalent width ( ew ) of h@xmath0 in the observed mean spectra , where the mean broadening of 500 km s@xmath6 estimated in paper i have been subtracted , as the artificial intrinsic spectrum .",
    "this artificial intrinsic spectrum is used to generate a mock observed spectrum @xmath18 in each individual night by convolving with @xmath11 obtained from the fitting in section [ sec : broad ] and adding random noises with the same level of s / n as the truly observed spectrum .",
    "then , we select the iteration number which can get the best reconstruction ( with the smallest @xmath32 ) of the artificial intrinsic spectrum by de - convolving @xmath11 from the mock @xmath18 as the optimal number of iterations .",
    "the mock @xmath18 is generated 20 times for each spectrum , and the median value of the optimal numbers of iterations obtained by the above procedure is chosen as the final iteration number of the deconvolution .",
    "the spectra of agns and comparison stars are smeared by the same broadening function every night since both of them are point sources .",
    "however , the host galaxies of the objects are extended and their spectra are affected by broadening which is different from those of comparison stars . therefore , before de - convolving the spectra of agns with the broadening function obtained from the comparison stars in section [ sec : broad ] , the contribution of host galaxies should be removed .",
    "paper iii has already decomposed the spectra and extracted the contribution of host galaxies by fitting scheme .",
    "we simply subtract those host contributions , which we got in paper iii , from the spectra of objects before the procedures of deconvolution to avoid potential influence of different broadening in host galaxies .",
    "we make use of monte carlo simulation to evaluate the robustness of reconstructing the intrinsic profile of h@xmath0 line through the r - l deconvolution .",
    "we first create an artificial agn spectrum by including ( a ) a power - law continuum ; ( b ) fe ii emission and broad he ii ; ( c ) narrow emission lines of h@xmath0 and [ o iii]@xmath314959,5007 and ( d ) a broad component of @xmath7 .",
    "the components here are almost the same as the model we used in paper iii except for the absence of host galaxy contribution ( host does not influence the profiles of h@xmath0 in the simulation ) .",
    "we set the fwhm and ew of h@xmath0 in the artificial agn spectrum to 1200km / s and 100  ( see figure [ fig : input ] ) , respectively , which are the typical values in the present sample . in order to test the precision of recovery by the deconvolution in the cases with various broadening and s / n ratio ,",
    "we broaden the artificial spectrum by different broadening function and plus stochastic noise to generate the simulated observed spectra .",
    "in the meantime , we select a stellar spectral template ( hd 44951 used here ) from the indo - u.s .",
    "library and broaden it with the same broadening as the agn spectrum and plus noise as well .",

    "the comparison of emission - line profiles before and after the deconvolution in the monte carlo simulations is shown in figure [ fig : fwhm ] .",

    "( w20 , w50 , w80 ) and ( c20 , c50 , c80 ) of the reconstructed h@xmath0 profiles are consistent with the value of the input artificial agn spectrum in the cases with high s / n ratios . the reconstruction is more successful in the cases with narrower broadening function and higher s / n ratio , especially when the fwhm of broadening is narrower than the input h@xmath0 profile .",
    "the widths of h@xmath0 in the observed spectra of seambh2012 are 1000 @xmath16 2000 km s@xmath6 , while the broadening is only @xmath16 500 km s@xmath6 . and",
    "the s / n ratio of spectra in seambh2012 is generally higher than 20 .",
    "therefore , the intrinsic profiles recovered by the deconvolution section [ sec : correct ] is reliable .      in order to give an overall evaluation how",
    "effectively does the deconvolution work , examples of the comparison between observed and de - convolved spectra of mrk 335 are provided in figure [ fig : profiles ] .",
    "it is very obvious that the deconvolution procedures correct the broadening and mis - centering effect successfully . to further compare the profiles before and after the deconvolution , we measure ( w20 , w50 , w80 ) and ( c20 , c50 , c80 ) of h@xmath0 in the spectra before and after the deconvolution procedures . as an example , the values of mrk 335 are shown in figure [ fig : width_shift ] .",

    "in particular , the distribution of w80 in the reconstructed spectra becomes much narrower , which means the more serious influence caused by the broadening around the peak ( the highest and narrowest part ) of emission line , than in its wing part ( with broader width ) , have been corrected effectively .",
    "additionally , the centers at different levels ( c20 , c50 , c80 ) are more concentrated than the cases before the deconvolution .",

    "the light curves and the time delays between the variations of the continuum at 5100  and h@xmath0 fluxes measured by simply integrating the full extent of the emission lines have been published in paper i and ii .",
    "paper iii updated these measurements by introducing a sophisticated scheme that fit agn continuum , host contribution in the slit and emission lines simultaneously .",
    "the updated time lags are consistent with the previous ones but have smaller uncertainties ( see the comparison in paper iii ) .",
    "however , these time delays only stand for the radii averaged by the emissivity function of blrs , and no information of velocity fields is carried out . in this section ,",
    "we focus on the velocity - resolved analysis of delays in order to reveal the kinematics of blr clouds in seambhs",
    ".    the procedures of deconvolution in section [ sec : correct ] have removed the varying line - broadening from the observed profiles and almost corrected the wavelength shifts caused by mis - centering . after further correcting the remanent shifts ( @xmath37 km s@xmath6 ) using [ o iii]@xmath38 line as our wavelength reference , the spectra are ready for velocity - resolved time series analysis .",
    "rms ( root of mean - square ) spectra of the objects are obtained in the standard way from the spectra after the line - broadening correction .",

    "the comparison in figure [ fig : mrk335_compare ] also indicates that the deconvolution procedures can recover the velocity - resolved information moderately in rm time - series analysis .    before our observation , mrk 335 was monitored twice in 1989@xmath11996 @xcite and 2010@xmath12011 @xcite , respectively .",

    "there are a few objects ( 2 out of 4 super - eddington agns ) showing clear evidence for the presence of infalling gas in blrs . considering the fact that objects in the present sample are super - eddington accreting agns , the velocity fields of the surrounding gas showing infall in kinematics are not surprising .",
    "otherwise , a significant fraction of the accreting gas will be channelled into outflows , making fast growth of less massive black holes be suppressed .",
    "it is impossible to reach a conclusion about the pattern of velocity fields of ionised gas in the vicinity of black holes in super - eddington accreting agns .",
    "we hope increases of monitored seambhs and normal agns could clarify the patterns of the velocity fields .",
    "we have presented here velocity - resolved time lag measurements of nine objects observed in our seambh2012 campaign . to correct the line - broadening caused by instruments and seeing",
    ", we use richardson - lucy deconvolution to reconstruct h@xmath0 profiles . the broadening function in each night is estimated by fitting the spectra of the stars observed simultaneously with stellar templates , and monte carlo method is adopted to test the validity of the broadening - correction procedures .",
    "we show that the richdson - lucy iteration is an efficient method to recover the velocity - resolved information to some extent .",
    "all of the objects in the present sample are nls1s with very high accretion rates except for mcg + 06 - 26 - 012 .",
    "five sources among them demonstrate clear velocity - resolved time delays in their h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "the velocity - resolved lags of mrk 335 and mrk 486 show the signature of gas infall , while the blr clouds in mrk 142 and mcg + 06 - 26 - 012 tend to be radial outflowing .",
    "the symmetric pattern of mrk 1044 is consistent with virialized motions .",
    "the time lags of the other four objects are not velocity - resolvable .",
    "we do not find significant differences in the blr kinematics of seambhs , comparing with sub - eddington agns .",
    "some discussions for the result of each individual object are provided in the main text .",
    "this analysis provides new insight into the geometry and kinematics of blrs in seambhs .",
