    "inflation is the standard paradigm for the generation of perturbations in matter density that produces large - scale structure  ( lss ) in the universe @xcite . although the inflationary paradigm has successfully predicted various properties of the observable universe , including flatness and a nearly scale - invariant spectrum of perturbations @xcite , the correct model of inflation has yet to be confirmed .",
    "the simplest inflation models predict nearly gaussian primordial perturbations , though more complex models such as multi - field inflation @xcite posit a departure from a gaussian distribution .",
    "alternatives to inflation , such as the ekpyrotic model of cyclic expansion and contraction @xcite , also predict non - gaussian primordial perturbations . since a detection of non",
    "- gaussianity would discriminate between these fundamentally different models , much work is being done to constrain non - gaussianity , both in lss through the galaxy distribution and through anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "primordial non - gaussianity is readily probed through measurements of the bispectrum of the cmb , in which a nonzero measurement constitutes a `` smoking gun '' detection , modulo any systematic effects .",
    "some alternative probes of non - gaussianity in lss include the galaxy bispectrum , which is plagued by nonlinearities , and galaxy cluster abundances and dark - matter halo clustering , which suffer from low - number statistics .",
    "the accepted parametrization of primordial non - gaussianity is to introduce a quadratic term to the primordial potential @xmath5 , written as @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a gaussian random field @xcite .",
    "this form describes local - type non - gaussianity with an amplitude @xmath2 .",
    "the latest constraint on @xmath2 is from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe s ( wmap ) seven - year bispectrum , which gives @xmath8 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite , which will soon give results from its first data release , is expected to produce constraints on @xmath2 of order @xmath9 @xcite",
    ".    one useful effect of non - gaussianity that has gained much attention , and which we explore in this analysis , is a distinct scale - dependent clustering bias on large scales @xcite .",
    "specifically , it has been shown that @xmath2-type non - gaussianity produces a shift in the bias that behaves as @xmath10 ; this can suppress or enhance clustering on the largest scales .",
    "various authors have used the large - scale angular power spectra of lss tracers to constrain @xmath2 assuming a scale - dependent bias .",
    "@xcite , using the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) @xcite data release 5 ( dr5 ) @xcite , derived the constraints @xmath11 at 95% c.l .  using the photometric quasar sample and @xmath12 at 95% c.l",
    "when these quasars are combined with other data sets , such as the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) and luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) . this analysis was extended in @xcite to include the sdss dr6 @xcite photometric quasar catalog compiled by  @xcite , hereafter rqcat .",
    "@xcite extended this analysis to a two - parameter curvaton model @xcite while others have sought to use this method in combination with other data sets @xcite .",
    "@xcite also showed that _ planck _ and _ euclid _ @xcite together could possibly detect @xmath13 .",
    "finally , work on using multiple tracers of different bias @xcite has predicted future limits of @xmath14 .    as in all auto - spectrum measurements , particularly on large angular scales , potential correlations caused by systematic effects must be removed to isolate the correlation signal from the lss tracer .",
    "systematics have been a concern in recent analyses of the _ baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey _ ( boss ) @xcite .",
    "studies of boss photometric galaxies @xcite attempted to remove systematic effects by fitting an amplitude for each systematic template , and subtracting its estimated contribution from the power spectrum .",
    "recent work in @xcite outlines a formalism for how photometric calibration variations affect power spectrum and cosmological parameter estimations .",
    "another method for removing systematics is mode projection , which explicitly marginalizes over the amplitude of each template that traces the spatial dependence of a potential systematic error .",
    "this method has been profitably used for foreground removal in the low-@xmath15 cmb power spectrum ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this method is more robust than subtracting the estimated contamination from the power spectrum estimator , because it is _ exactly _ insensitive to any systematic that traces the spatial dependence of the template .",
    "it also avoids the possibility of `` oversubtraction ''  the phenomenon in which chance correlations of the real galaxy density with systematics templates lead to an overestimate of the contamination , and hence lead to a downward bias in the low-@xmath15 power spectrum .    in this paper",
    ", we attempt to remove large - scale systematics from the latest photometric quasar sample available , which is rqcat .",
    "we investigate the photometric quasar sample because , by probing large redshifts , quasars are able to probe scale - dependent bias more effectively than other matter tracers , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "we use photometric quasars from a larger redshift range than this previous analysis , using redshifts as low as @xmath16 and as high as @xmath17 .",
    "we divide this sample into three redshift slices ( 0.91.3 , 1.62.0 , 2.32.9 ) and construct three angular cross - power spectra to test if they are consistent with zero , which we expect since quasars at different redshifts should be uncorrelated on large scales .",
    "we also construct templates of various potential systematic effects and try mode - projecting them from the angular cross - power spectrum estimator .    note that the sample used by e.g. @xcite was constructed by a different algorithm and",
    "is _ not _ the restriction of the rqcat sample to an earlier , smaller footprint .",
    "therefore the specific amplitude of systematic errors herein should not be taken as quantitatively indicative of the level of contamination in these previous analyses .",
    "we find that without mode - projecting any systematics , the first and second redshift slices are correlated with an 9.2@xmath1 significance , and the first and third redshift slices are correlated with a 2.7@xmath1 significance , both on large scales .",
    "this implies that systematics are heavily contaminating large - scale correlations in the quasar maps .",
    "using mode projection , we find significant reductions in the correlations between redshift slices after removing templates corresponding to the stellar density , stellar locus offsets , airmass , and seeing .",
    "we are able to decrease the significance of the correlation between the first and third redshift slices to 1.8@xmath1 ; however , the significance of the correlation between the first and second redshift slices decreased only to 5.4@xmath1 , which is indicative of significant contamination .",
    "while the quasar catalog exhibits @xmath32% contamination , measuring @xmath4 will require a contamination level less than 1% .",
    "we conclude that other systematic effects are still present that are contaminating the sdss photometric quasar sample .",

    "the extinction cut is very important because a high extinction affects the @xmath34 band , which is crucial to identifying quasars .",
    "also , since stars tend to be misidentified as quasars , it seems prudent to cut regions with high stellar density .",
    "we implement these cuts using dust maps from @xcite and a stellar overdensity map , smoothed with a 2@xmath35 fwhm gaussian profile , constructed from stars ( @xmath36 ) with @xmath37 ( cutoff for point sources in rqcat ) from the sdss dr6 @xcite .",
    "we also reject pixels for which the survey region covers less than 80% of the pixel area .",
    "we also excised several rectangular regions that appeared to contain missing data ; the angular rectangles in equatorial ( j2000 ) coordinates that were removed are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , + @xmath46 , and @xmath47 .",

    "the derivation for the scale - dependent bias model for non - gaussianity of the `` local '' ( @xmath4 ) type is detailed in @xcite , for which we give a brief overview .",
    "the model assumes the halo model scenario ( see @xcite for a detailed review ) in which all matter is contained in a distribution of halos on large scales which mimics the distribution of matter on small scales . in the gaussian case ,",
    "fluctuations on small and large scales are uncorrelated .",
    "however , a signature of local - type non - gaussianity is that the @xmath50 term in the gravitational potential ( see eq .",
    "[ e : fnl1 ] ) causes small - scale matter fluctuations to correlate with large - scale halo fluctuations due to mixing of their respective gravity perturbations .",
    "positive ( negative ) @xmath2 incurs a positive ( negative ) correlation between scales and an increase ( decrease ) in the halo bias on large scales as compared to the gaussian case .",
    "specifically , this scale - dependent shift in the bias was derived for a general halo mass function @xmath51 in @xcite to be @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the wavenumber corresponding to the length scale probed , @xmath54 is the transfer function , @xmath55 is the the growth factor normalized such that @xmath56 , @xmath57 is the speed of light , @xmath58 is the hubble parameter today , and @xmath59 is the rms overdensity in a sphere of radius @xmath60 mpc . for the case of a universal mass function , such as the press - schechter @xcite or sheth - tormen @xcite mass functions , this expression was shown in @xcite to reduce to @xmath61 the expression first derived in @xcite , where @xmath62 is the matter density today relative to the critical density for a flat universe , and @xmath63 is the critical density of spherical collapse .",
    "the parameter @xmath64 ranges from 1 for lrgs , which populate all halos equally , to 1.6 for quasars that populate only recently merged halos .",
    "we use eq .",
    "( [ e : dbuni ] ) with @xmath65 in our analysis to model the scale - dependent bias of quasars .",
    "the clustering bias is a key component of the matter power spectrum @xmath66 , thus we expect scale - dependent bias to affect it as well as the angular power spectrum @xmath67 .",
    "since we are interested in large correlations in this analysis , we can not use the small - scale limber approximation , but must use the full expression for @xmath67 including redshift - space distortions .",
    "these expressions are given for the scale - independent bias case in eqs .",
    "29 and 30 in @xcite and for the scale - dependent bias case in @xcite .",
    "we assume the linear matter power spectrum in our analysis mpc@xmath68 . for our redshifts , this corresponds to @xmath69 .",
    "we only use @xmath67 for @xmath70 , so it is safe to use the linear matter power spectrum in our analysis . ] .",

    "[ f : cl ] , including for the cases of nonzero @xmath4 .",
    "non - gaussianity , which produces a shift in the bias of the form @xmath10 , manifests itself on large angular scales .",
    "if any systematic effect can increase power on large scales , we will be unable to distinguish it from scale - dependent bias .",
    "one way to attempt to assess the contamination of our quasar maps would be to cross - correlate the quasar maps with each of the systematics and see if it is nonzero , which was done in @xcite with stars and red stars .",
    "however , this will be difficult to do for the other systematics we consider because the errors are uncertain .",
    "thus , in this analysis we compare angular cross - power spectra before and after mode - projecting an individual systematic to see if it decreases .",
    "more specifically , we first calculate the angular cross - power spectrum without attempting to remove any systematics .",
    "we then recalculate it , except that we mode - project one systematic . finally , we compare the two to see if the spectra are significantly different",
    ". since there are three redshift bins , there will be 3 cross - spectra .",
    "the cross - spectra are useful because we expect different quasar maps to be uncorrelated if they are clean since objects from separate redshift bins should not correlate with each other . and [ f : clqcrsys ] , where we see a finite cross - correlation on smaller scales .",
    "] however , if the same systematic effect appears in two quasar maps , then their cross - spectra will be non - zero .",
    "so our goal for each cross - spectra is to identify those systematics for which mode - projection decreases the magnitude of the cross - spectra , and then try mode - projecting this set of systematics together to see if the cross - spectra goes to zero , which would be the limit of the usefulness of this test .",
    "if it remains non - zero , then we know that there remains systematic effects in the maps that are unidentified .",
    "of course , this will only identify those systematics which contaminate two or all three quasar maps .",
    "there may be systematic effects that contaminate only one of the maps that would not appear in the cross - spectra yet still contaminate any estimates of @xmath4 using auto - spectra .",
    "we decide not to search for this case since the auto - spectra we would need for the test would also be used to to constrain @xmath4 .",
    "however , this case should be considered in future work .      in order to construct our angular power spectrum estimator",
    ", we begin by constructing the data vector @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 length-@xmath74 vectors constituting the two maps we are cross - correlating , making @xmath75 have a length of @xmath76 .",
    "the covariance matrix for @xmath75 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( @xmath80 and @xmath81 ) are the signal ( noise ) covariance matrices for map 1 and map 2 , respectively , and we neglect any cross - correlation between the maps .",

    "note that we project out the monopole and dipole of the power spectra since these moments are not of interest cosmologically .",
    "the simplest way to remove a data point is to set its error to infinity ( or a large value , so 1/error@xmath99 ) .",
    "since the errors for multipoles with low shot noise are proportional to the multipole , setting the monopole and dipole to large values actually removes their estimator contributions to @xmath100 .",
    "giving large values to these moments increases their covariances in the estimator , making their contributions negligible , while increasing estimate errors slightly .",

    "our treatment of masked pixels is similar . we construct our estimator in real space , such that masking pixels , or striking missing pixels from the covariance matrix before inversion , is equivalent to setting the noise in these pixels to infinity , which removes their effect from the estimator anyway .",

    "the `` almost '' is because the healpix pixels cross the scanning field boundaries , causing cases where a pixel is observed by multiple fields . in these cases the template value for camcol @xmath133 is given a fractional value denoting the percentage _ of the observed part _ of the pixel that was observed by camcol @xmath133 .",

    "while each of the systematic templates has a `` primary motivation , '' each one may be sensitive to several contaminating effects .",
    "for example , the stellar color locus test is obviously sensitive to photometric calibration errors , but also contains some sensitivity to galactic dust and to the variation of stellar populations over the sky .",
    "the stellar density maps were motivated by the possibility of stellar contamination , however they are also correlated with the dust map since both are largest at low galactic latitudes . however , each of these effects is independent of the true quasar density and correlations of the quasar map with any of them would be problematic ; note also that since the template projection removes any linear combination of the input templates , there is no requirement that these templates be orthogonal , or sensitive to only a single root cause of systematic error .",
    "we also list the pearson correlation coefficients for all the templates in table [ t : corr ] .",
    "we see that almost all the templates have low correlations with other templates . of the 171 possible template pairings ,",
    "only 7 of them have correlations ( positive or negative ) greater than @xmath13720% .",
    "the only two templates correlated with each other by more than 50% are the seeing templates in the @xmath34 and @xmath129 bands ( 80% ) .",
    "this implies that mode - projecting this set of the templates should remove a diverse set of modes .",
    "note that if the range of variation in conditions is large ( e.g. as for the airmass or sky brightness ) , the spurious contribution to the quasar density may be nonlinear in the template ",
    "e.g. we may have @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a template ( e.g. the airmass ) and @xmath140 is a nonlinearity coefficient . since the template projection method is a linear method",
    ", we can only remove the @xmath140-term by adding yet another template proportional to @xmath141 ; in general , if multiple templates have large variations we would also have to include products of template maps .",

    "large - scale biases are not expected to be this high , particularly with the magnitude of @xmath142 .",
    "this leads us to suspect that systematic errors in these slices are corrupting these quasar maps .",

    ", we find several templates that significantly increased the cross - correlations .",
    "we list these templates for both cross - correlations in tables [ t : sysf1 ] and [ t : sysf2 ] . the biggest contributors by far to @xmath142 seem to be seeing in the @xmath34 and @xmath129 bands .",
    "mode - projecting each of these individually reduce the cross - correlation significance by more than 3@xmath1 .",
    "red star contamination , photometric calibration errors , and air mass also seem to play a role .",
    "our uncovering of red star contamination seems to be in agreement with @xcite , which found both of their samples of quasars to be contaminated by them .",
    "mode - projecting all these templates yields a cross - correlation measurement of @xmath149 ( @xmath150 ) , which is closest to the value from @xmath34-band seeing .",
    "it appears that seeing is a very important systematic effect in our quasar maps , and it should be monitored in future lss experiments .",
    "we tried to decrease @xmath142 further by mode - projecting products of templates .",
    "we tested several combinations , including ( @xmath151)@xmath19 , ( @xmath121)@xmath19 , ( @xmath152)@xmath19 , ( @xmath128)@xmath19 , ( @xmath130)@xmath19 , @xmath153 , @xmath154 , @xmath155 , @xmath156 , @xmath157 , @xmath158 , @xmath159 , @xmath160 , and @xmath161 none of the combinations we tested decreased the cross - correlation significantly .",
    "it is important to note that although we were able to reduce the cross - correlation significance by 3.8@xmath1 , the cross - correlation is far too high .",
    "we conclude that more systematics are present that were not found .    for @xmath146",

    "[ f : cl ] , it appears we need the contamination level to be @xmath31% or less to see fluctuations from @xmath168 or 0.6% for @xmath169 .",
    "it is important to note that we can divide the systematic errors in our photometric quasar maps into two categories  _ contamination _ and _ calibration_. stellar contamination is the principal example of the former since we are selecting point sources : it results due to the imperfection of the photometric redshift method in identifying quasars .",
    "( in principle , crowding could lead to `` negative '' contamination since the presence of a higher stellar density may reduce the completeness of the catalog . )",
    "@xcite claim a 96% efficiency in identifying uvx quasars with @xmath170 , yet this probably decreases for higher redshift quasars .",
    "this may explain why stellar contamination arises in the cross - correlation of z01z03 and not z01z02 .",
    "the other type of systematic error is calibration , where variations in the observing conditions or instrument properties propagate to changes in the completeness of the quasar catalog .",
    "this may consist of first - order calibration effects ( as in the case of photometric calibration errors , or airmass effects that shift the center of the @xmath34 band ) , as well as second - order or noise - induced effects such as that contributed by the sky brightness .",
    "although contamination has been the main focus of previous photometric catalogs , it appears that even the excellent internal calibration of the sdss does not provide samples with the uniformity on large scales needed for @xmath4 studies .",
    "we searched for various systematic effects in the sdss dr6 photometric quasar catalog @xcite , which is the latest catalog available .",
    "we find that the clustering signal from this catalog is contaminated on the largest scales .",
    "in particular , our z01 subsample ( @xmath171 ) and our z02 subsample ( @xmath172 ) exhibits a 9.2@xmath1 detection of cross correlation on scales @xmath173 , even though quasars from separate redshifts on these scales should be uncorrelated .",
    "we suspect that the cause of this large cross - correlation is systematic effects . by mode - projecting several candidate templates individually , we find that the maps are indeed contaminated by stars , photometric calibration errors , and variations in air mass and seeing , with seeing being the dominant contaminant . by mode - projecting this group of templates together , we were able to decrease the significance of the cross - correlation by more than 3@xmath1 . however , it is still too high to provide a competitive constraint on @xmath2 through scale - dependent bias .",
