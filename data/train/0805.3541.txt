    "directed planar graphs with weighted edges have been widely used in the study of totally nonnegative matrices ( @xcite ) .",
    "( reviews of the area can be found in @xcite . ) in particular , a special kind of such graphs is a convenient tool for visualizing in the @xmath0 case lusztig type parametrizations of double bruhat cells @xcite .",
    "each parametrization of this kind is obtained via a factorization of an element of a cell into a product of elementary factors .",
    "the standard poisson - lie structure on reductive lie groups is induced by a very simple poisson bracket on factorization parameters .",
    "recently , postnikov used weighted directed planar graphs to parametrize cells in grassmannians @xcite .",
    "the main goal of this paper is to investigate poisson properties of postnikov s parametrization . using a graphical interpretation of the poisson - lie property inspired by the lusztig parametrization",
    ", we introduce a natural family of poisson brackets on the space of edge weights .",
    "these brackets induce a two - parameter family of poisson brackets on the grassmannian .",
    "every poisson bracket in this family is compatible ( in the sense of @xcite ) with the cluster algebra on the grassmannian described in @xcite and , on the other hand , endows the grassmannian with a structure of a poisson homogeneous space with respect to the natural action of the general linear group equipped with an r - matrix poisson - lie structure .",
    "this paper is the first in the series devoted to the study of poisson properties of weighted directed graphs on surfaces .",
    "the second paper @xcite generalizes results of the current one to graphs in an annulus . in this case",
    ", the analogue of postnikov s construction leads to a map into the space of loops in the grassmannian .",
    "natural poisson brackets on edge weights in this case are intimately connected to trigonometric r - matrix brackets on matrix - valued rational functions .",
    "the third paper @xcite utilizes particular graphs in an annulus to introduce a cluster algebra structure related to the coordinate ring of the space of normalized rational functions in one variable .",
    "this space is birationally equivalent , via the moser map @xcite , to any minimal irreducible coadjoint orbit of the group of upper triangular matrices associated with a coxeter element of the permutation group . in this case , the poisson bracket compatible with the cluster algebra structure coincides with the quadratic poisson bracket studied in @xcite in the context of toda flows on minimal orbits .",
    "we show that cluster transformations serve as bcklund - darboux transformations between different minimal toda flows .",
    "the fourth paper @xcite solves , in the case of graphs in an annulus with one source and one sink , the inverse problem of restoring the weights from the image of the generalized postnikov map . in the case of arbitrary planar graphs in a disk ,",
    "this problem was completely solved by postnikov @xcite who proved that for a fixed minimal graph , the space of weights modulo gauge action is birational to its image and described all minimal graphs . to the contrary , already for simplest graphs in an annulus , the corresponding map can only be shown to be finite . in @xcite , the inverse problem for the totally nonnegative matrices",
    "is solved for a particular type of minimal graphs . in @xcite",
    "we describe all minimal graphs with one source and one sink .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ ppn ] , we introduce a notion of a perfect network in a disk and associate with every such network a _ matrix of boundary measurements_. each boundary measurement is shown to be a rational function in edge weights and admits a subtraction - free rational expression , see proposition  [ sfree ] . in section [ psmat ] , we characterize all _ universal _ poisson brackets on the space of edge weights of a given network that respect the natural operation of concatenation of networks , see proposition [ 6param ] . furthermore , we establish that the family of universal brackets induces a linear two - parameter family of poisson brackets on boundary measurement matrices , see theorem  [ psm ] .",
    "this family depends on a mutual location of sources and sinks , but not on the network itself .",
    "we provide an explicit description of this family in theorem  [ psme ] . in section [ psongr ] , we start by showing that if the sources and the sinks are not intermixed along the boundary of the disk , one can recover a 2-parametric family of r - matrices and the corresponding r - matrix brackets on @xmath0 , see theorem  [ psgl ] .",
    "next , the boundary measurement map defined by a network with @xmath1 sources and @xmath2 sinks is extended to the grassmannian boundary measurement map into the grassmannian @xmath3 .",
    "the poisson family on boundary measurement matrices allows us to equip the grassmannian with a two - parameter family of poisson brackets @xmath4 in such a way that for any choice of a universal poisson bracket on edge weights there is a unique member of @xmath4 that makes the grassmannian boundary measurement map poisson , see theorem  [ psgr ] .",
    "this latter family depends only on the number of sources and sinks and does not depend on their mutual location .",
    "finally , we give an interpretation of the natural @xmath0 action on @xmath3 in terms of networks and establish that every member of the poisson family @xmath4 on @xmath3 makes @xmath3 into a poisson homogeneous space of @xmath0 equipped with the above described r - matrix bracket , see theorem  [ poihomo ] . in section [ compclust ] ,",
    "we review the construction of the cluster algebra structure on an open cell in the grassmannian given in @xcite .",
    "we then introduce face weights and use them to show that every member of the poisson family @xmath4 is compatible with this cluster algebra structure , see theorem  [ thm : poisscomp ] .",
    "let @xmath5 be a directed planar graph with no loops and parallel edges drawn inside a disk ( and considered up to an isotopy ) with the vertex set @xmath6 and the edge set @xmath7 .",
    "exactly @xmath8 of its vertices are located on the boundary circle of the disk .",

    "all the internal vertices of @xmath17 have degree  @xmath18 and are of two types : either they have exactly one incoming edge , or exactly one outcoming edge .",
    "the vertices of the first type are called ( and shown on figures ) _ white _ , those of the second type , _",

    "a _ perfect planar network _",
    "@xmath20 is obtained from @xmath17 as above by assigning a weight @xmath21 to each edge @xmath22 . in what follows",
    "we occasionally write `` network '' instead of `` perfect planar network '' .",

    "we assume for simplicity that for any such pair @xmath54 , the cone spanned by @xmath51 and @xmath52 is not a line ; in other words , if @xmath51 and @xmath52 are collinear , then they have the same direction .",
    "observe that since @xmath50 is not necessary simple , there might be other edges of @xmath50 incident to @xmath53 ( see figure  [ fig : concord ] below ) .",
    "let @xmath55 be an arbitrary oriented line .",
    "define @xmath56 in the following way : @xmath57 if the directing vector of @xmath55 belongs to the interior of the cone spanned by @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath58 otherwise ( see figure  [ fig : concord ] for examples ) .",

    "finally the weight of @xmath41 is defined as @xmath68 the weight of an arbitrary cycle in @xmath42 is defined in the same way via the concordance number of the cycle .",
    "if edges @xmath32 and @xmath69 in @xmath41 coincide and @xmath70 , the path @xmath41 can be decomposed into the path @xmath71 and the cycle @xmath72 .",
    "clearly , @xmath73 , and hence @xmath74    consider the path @xmath75 in figure  [ fig : pergraph ] . choose @xmath55 as shown in the figure ; @xmath55 is neither collinear with the edges of @xmath41 nor with the relevant edges of the convex hull of boundary vertices ( shown by dotted lines ) .",

    "so , @xmath79 , and hence @xmath80 .",
    "the same result can be obtained by decomposing @xmath41 into the path @xmath81 and the cycle @xmath82 .",
    "[ dualdir]instead of closed polygonal curves @xmath67 , one can use curves @xmath83 obtained by adding to @xmath41 the path between @xmath66 and @xmath65 that goes clockwise along the boundary of the convex hull of all the boundary vertices of @xmath42 .",
    "it is a simple exercise to prove that the concordance numbers of @xmath67 and @xmath83 coincide .",
    "therefore , the weight of a path can be defined also as @xmath84      given a perfect planar network as above , a source @xmath65 , @xmath85 , and a sink @xmath66 , @xmath86 , we define the _ boundary measurement _ @xmath87 as the sum of the weights of all paths starting at @xmath65 and ending at @xmath66 .",
    "clearly , the boundary measurement thus defined is a formal infinite series in variables @xmath28 , @xmath22 .",

    "the base of induction is the case when there are no internal vertices at all , and hence each edge connects a source and a sink ; in this case the statement of the proposition holds trivially .",

    "the corresponding boundary measurement matrix is a @xmath161 matrix given by @xmath162",
    "a natural operation on networks is their _ concatenation _ , which consists , roughly speaking , in gluing some sinks / sources of one network to some of the sources / sinks of the other .",
    "we expect any poisson structure associated with networks to behave naturally under concatenation . to obtain from two planar networks a new one by concatenation , one needs to select a segment from the boundary of each disk and identify these segments via a homeomorphism in such a way that every sink ( resp .",
    "source ) contained in the selected segment of the first network is glued to a source ( resp .",
    "sink ) of the second network .",
    "we can then erase the common piece of the boundary along which the gluing was performed and identify every pair of glued edges in the resulting network with a single edge of the same orientation and with the weight equal to the product of two weights assigned to the two edges that were glued .    as an illustration ,",
    "let us review a particular but important case , in which sources and sinks of the network do not interlace .",
    "in this case , it is more convenient to view the network as located in a square rather than in a disk , with all sources located on the left side and sinks on the right side of the square",
    ". it will be also handy to label sources ( resp .",
    "sinks ) @xmath164 to @xmath1 ( resp .",
    "@xmath164 to @xmath165 ) going from the bottom to the top .",
    "this results in a different way of recording boundary measurements into a matrix .",
    "namely , if @xmath166 is the boundary measurements matrix we defined earlier , then now we associate with the network the matrix @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is the matrix of the longest permutation @xmath169 .",
    "we can now concatenate two networks of this kind , one with @xmath1 sources and @xmath165 sinks and another with @xmath165 sources and @xmath55 sinks , by gluing the sinks of the former to the sources of the latter . if @xmath170 , @xmath171 are @xmath151 and @xmath172 matrices associated with the two networks , then the matrix associated with their concatenation is @xmath173 . note that this `` visualization '' of the matrix multiplication is particularly relevant when one deals with factorization of matrices into products of elementary bidiagonal matrices .",
    "indeed , a @xmath174 diagonal matrix @xmath175 and elementary bidiagonal matrices @xmath176 and @xmath177 correspond to planar networks shown in figure  [ fig : factor ] a , b and c , respectively ; all weights not shown explicitly are equal to  1 .",
    "the construction of poisson structures we are about to present is motivated by the way in which the network representation of the bidiagonal factorization reflects the _ standard poisson - lie structure _ on @xmath178 .",

    "an example of such a network is given by figure  [ fig : genfactor ] .",
    "on the other hand , due to the poisson - lie property , the poisson structure on @xmath178 is inherited from simple poisson brackets for parameters @xmath233 , which can be described completely in terms of networks : ( i ) the bracket of any two parameters is equal to their product times a constant ; ( ii ) this constant is equal to zero unless the corresponding edges have a common source / sink ; ( iii ) the constant equals @xmath234 if the corresponding edges follow one another around the source / sink in the counterclockwise direction . the corresponding poisson - lie structure on @xmath0 is obtained by requiring the determinant to be a casimir function .",
