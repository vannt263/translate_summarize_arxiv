    "pulsars are born as highly - magnetised ( @xmath1 g ) , rapidly rotating ( @xmath2 ms ) neutron stars which spin down on timescales of 10 to 100 million years due to magnetic dipole radiation . however , a number of millisecond ( @xmath3 ms ) radio pulsars is known with ages of billions of years and weak ( @xmath4 g ) surface magnetic fields .",
    "since many of these millisecond pulsars are in binaries , it has long been suspected ( see , e.g. , @xcite for an extended review ) that they were spun up by mass transfer from a stellar companion in a low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , but years of searching for coherent millisecond pulsations in lmxbs failed to yield a detection ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the launch of the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) brought the discovery of kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpos ; @xcite ) as well as nearly coherent oscillations ( burst oscillations ) during type - i x - ray bursts in a number of lmxbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) , providing tantalisingly suggestive evidence for weakly magnetic neutron stars with millisecond spin periods ( see @xcite and @xcite for more details about khz qpos and burst oscillations in lmxbs ) .    in 1998",
    "april the first accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar ( sax j1808.43658 ) was discovered @xcite proving that indeed neutron stars in lmxbs can spin very rapidly .",
    "this conclusion was further strengthened by the discovery of four additional systems during the last two years @xcite .",
    "here , i will give a brief summary of our current observational knowledge of those accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsars .",
    "in 1996 september , a new x - ray transient and lmxb was discovered with the wide field cameras ( wfcs ) aboard the _ bepposax _ satellite and the source was designated sax j1808.43658 @xcite .",
    "three type - i x - ray bursts were detected , demonstrating that the compact object in this system is a neutron star . from those bursts ,",
    "a distance estimate of 2.5 kpc was determined @xcite .",
    "the maximum luminosity during this outburst was @xmath5 ergs s@xmath6 , significantly lower than the peak outburst luminosity of classical neutron star transients .",
    "this low peak luminosity showed that the source was part of the growing group of faint neutron - star x - ray transients @xcite .",
    "the outburst continued for about three weeks , after which the source was thought to have returned to quiescence .",
    "however , recently it was found @xcite that the source was detected on 1996 october 29 ( using slew data obtained with the proportional counter array [ pca ] aboard _ rxte _ ) with a luminosity of about a tenth of the outburst peak luminosity .",
    "this demonstrates that six weeks after the main outburst the source was still active ( possible only sporadically ) , which might indicate behaviour for this source at the end of this outburst very similar to what has been seen during its 2000 and 2002 outbursts (   [ section:1808_2000_outburst ] and [ section:1808_2002_outburst ] ) .",
    "after it was found that sax j1808.43658 harbours a millisecond pulsar (   [ section:1808_1998_outburst ] ) , the three observed x - ray bursts were scrutinized for potential burst oscillations @xcite .",
    "a marginal detection of a 401 hz oscillation was made in the third burst .",
    "this result suggested that the burst oscillations observed in the other , non - pulsating , neutron - star lmxbs occur indeed at their neutron - star spin frequencies .",
    "this result has been confirmed by the recent detection of burst oscillations during the 2002 outburst of sax j1808.43658 (   [ section:1808_2002_outburst ] ) .",
    "on 1998 april 9 , _",

    ", it was discovered @xcite that coherent 401 hz pulsations were present in the persistent x - ray flux of the source , making it the first accretion - driven millisecond x - ray pulsar discovered .",
    "after this discovery , several more _",
    "rxte_/pca observations were made which were used by several groups to study different aspects of the source .",
    "i will only briefly mention those results and give references for details .    a detailed analysis of the coherent timing behaviour showed @xcite that the neutron star was in a tight binary with a very low - mass companion star in a @xmath02-hr orbital period .",
    "due to the limited amount of data obtained during this outburst , only an upper limit of @xmath7 hz s@xmath6 could be obtained on the pulse - frequency derivative @xcite .",
    "studies of the x - ray spectrum @xcite and the aperiodic rapid x - ray variability @xcite showed an object that , apart from its pulsations , is remarkably similar to other lmxbs with comparable luminosities ( the atoll sources ) . there is apparent modulation of the x - ray intensity at the orbital period , with a broad minimum when the pulsar is behind the companion @xcite .",
    "cui et al .",
    "@xcite and ford @xcite reported on the harmonic content , the energy dependency , and the soft phase lag of the pulsations .",
    "another interesting aspect is that the source first showed a steady decline in x - ray flux , which after @xmath02 weeks suddenly accelerated @xcite .",
    "this behaviour has been attributed to the fact that the source might have entered the propeller regime in which the accretion is centrifugally inhibited @xcite . however , after the onset of the steep decline the pulsations could still be detected @xcite making this interpretation doubtful . a week after the onset of this steep decline , the x - ray flux levelled off @xcite , but as no further _",
    "rxte_/pca observations were made , the x - ray behaviour of the source at the end of the outburst remained unclear .",
    "the source might have displayed a similar long - term episode of low - luminosity activity as seen at the end of its 2000 and 2002 outbursts (    [ section:1808_2000_outburst]-[section:1808_2002_outburst ] ) .",

    "it stayed at this level for at least several weeks before it further decreased in brightness .",
    "this behaviour suggests that the source was indeed still active for a long period after the main outburst .",
    "it was also reported @xcite that the optical flux was modulated at the 2-hr orbital period of the system . modelling the x - ray and optical emission from the system using an x - ray - heated accretion disk model , a @xmath8 of 0.68 and an inclination of @xmath9",
    "were obtained @xcite , resulting in a mass of the companion star of 0.050.10 m@xmath10 . some of the ir observations were too bright to be consistent with emission from the disk or the companion star , even when considering x - ray heating .",
    "this ir excess might be due to synchrotron processes , likely related to an outflow or ejection of matter @xcite .",
    "such an event was also confirmed by the discovery of the radio counterpart @xcite .",
    "the source was detected with a 4.8 ghz flux of @xmath00.8 mjy on 1998 april 27 , but it was not detected at earlier or later epochs .",
    "on 2000 january 21 , sax j1808.43658 was again detected @xcite with the _ rxte_/pca at a flux level of @xmath01015 mcrab ( 210 kev ) , i.e. about a tenth of the peak fluxes observed during the two previous outbursts .",

    "the light curve for this outburst is shown in figure  [ fig:1808_lc_2002 ] . during the first few weeks ,",
    "the source decayed steadily , until the rate of decline suddenly increased , very similar to what was observed during the 1998 outburst (   [ section:1808_1998_outburst ] ) .",
    "about five days later the x - ray count rate rapidly increased again until it reached a peak of about a tenth of the outburst maximum .",
    "after that the source entered a state in which the count rate rapidly fluctuated on time scales of days to hours , very similar to the 2000 low - level activity (   [ section:1808_2000_outburst ] ) .",
    "this outburst light curve is the most detailed one seen for this source and it exhibits all features seen during the previous three outbursts of the source ( the initial decline , the increase in the decline rate , the long - term low - level activity ) , demonstrating that this is typical source behaviour .",
    "the pulsations could be detected at all flux levels with an amplitude of 3%10% .",
    "the pulsar was spinning down at a constant rate ( mean spin - down rate of @xmath14 hz s@xmath6 ; @xcite ) , despite a large dynamic range of x - ray flux .",
    "the magnitude of the pulse - frequency derivative exceeds the maximum value expected from accretion torques by a factor of 5 .",
    "the timing history also contains a small glitch with a very rapid recovery time scale .",
    "there was no evidence for a 200.5 hz subharmonic in the data ( upper limit of 0.38% of the signal at 401 hz;@xcite ) confirming the interpretation of 401 hz as the pulsar spin frequency .",
    "a more detailed analysis will be presented elsewhere @xcite .      during the first five days of the outburst , four type - i x - ray bursts were detected . during the rise and decay of each burst , but not during the peak , burst oscillations were observed @xcite : the frequency in the burst tails was constant and identical to the spin frequency , while the oscillation in the burst rise showed evidence for a very rapid frequency drift of up to 5 hz .",
    "this frequency behaviour and the absence of oscillations at the peak of the bursts is similar to the burst oscillations seen in other , non - pulsating neutron star lmxbs , demonstrating that indeed the burst - oscillations occur at the neutron - star spin frequency in all sources . as a consequence",
    ", the spin frequency is now known for 16 lmxbs ( 11 burst - oscillations sources and 5 pulsars ) and the highest spin frequency is 619 hz . the sample of burst - oscillation sources was used to demonstrated that neutron stars in lmxbs spin well below the break - up frequency for neutron stars .",

    "these characteristics make the power spectrum of xte j1814 - 338 very similar to that observed in the non - pulsing low - luminosity neutron - star lmxbs ( the atoll sources ) when they are observed at relatively low x - ray luminosities ( i.e. , in the so - called island state ) .",
