    "in modified newtonian dynamics ( mond ) it is postulated that the effective gravitational acceleration , @xmath0 , deviates from the newtonian value , @xmath1 , below a critical acceleration , @xmath2 , in the sense that @xmath3 ( milgrom 1983 ) . that the empirically determined value of @xmath2 ( @xmath4 cm/@xmath5 ) coincides with @xmath6 to within an order of magnitude",
    "was immediately noticed by milgrom who speculated that mond may reflect the influence of cosmology on local particle dynamics . in the context of general relativity ( gr ) , there is no such cosmological influence .",
    "this is essentially due to fact that gr embodies the equivalence principle in its strong form which forbids environmental influence on local dynamics , apart from tides .",
    "however , if the gravitational force is partially mediated by a long range scalar field , as , for example , in brans - dicke theory , it is no longer the case a local system is immune from cosmological influence .",
    "the scalar field , determined by the universal mass distribution and its time evolution , pervades the universe and influences the gravitational dynamics of every subsystem . in brans - dicke theory",
    "this influence is evidenced by the cosmic evolution of the effective gravitational constant ( brans & dicke 1961 ) .",
    "this suggests that mond may have its basis in scalar - tensor theory ; indeed , the first relativistic theories proposed for mond were scalar - tensor theories with non - standard aspects : the aquadratic lagrangian theory , aqual ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 ) , in which the scalar field lagrangian is a general function of the usual scalar field invariant ( @xmath7 ) , and phase - coupling gravity , or pcg , ( bekenstein 1988 ) in which the scalar field is complex with standard lagrangian but only phase coupling to matter . both of these early attempts contain pathologies superluminal propagation or instability of the background ( bekenstein & milgrom 1984 , bekenstein 1990 ) .",
    "moreover , in these theories the scalar field is assumed to couple to matter jointly with the gravitational , or einstein , metric in order to preserve the universality of free fall ( weak equivalence principle or wep ) .",
    "but if that coupling is conformal , as in brans - dicke theory , then there is no enhanced gravitational deflection of photons due to the scalar field .",
    "this is in dramatic conflict with observations of lensing by clusters of galaxies ( bekenstein & sanders 1994 ) .",
    "the lensing contradiction led to the idea that the relation between the einstein and physical metrics should be more complicated than conformal ; i.e. , the so - called `` disformal transformation '' in which certain directions are picked out for additional dilation or contraction ( bekenstein 1993 , bekenstein & sanders 1994 ) .",
    "an initial proposal for such a theory ( sanders 1997 ) invoked a non - dynamical vector field , with only a time component in the preferred cosmological frame , to provide this additional stretching . the disformal coupling was combined with an aquadratic lagrangian for the scalar field to yield the mond phenomenology .",
    "however , the non - dynamical aspect of the vector field violates general covariance making it impossible to define a conserved energy- momentum tensor ( lee , lightman , & ni 1974 ) .",
    "this problem led bekenstein ( 2004 ) to construct a tensor - vector - scalar theory ( teves ) with a fully dynamical vector field ; this theory , while yielding mond phenomenology in the weak field limit , is fully covariant , produces lensing at the same level as gr with dark matter , and possesses no obvious anomalies ( propagation of scalar waves is causal ) .",
    "in the same vein , i proposed a bi - scalar tensor - vector theory ( bstv ) in order to provide a cosmological origin of @xmath8 and cosmological dark matter in the form of scalar field oscillations with wave - length sufficiently long to prevent clustering on the scale of galaxies ( sanders 2005 ) .",
    "thus it appears that any viable theory of mond as modified gravity will require fields in addition to the tensor field of gr a scalar field to yield the mond phenomenology ( as a fifth force ) and a vector field to facilitate the non - conformal coupling and adequate gravitational lensing .",
    "indeed , soussa & woodard ( 2004 ) have provided an elegant no - go argument to the effect that no single metric - based theory yielding mond phenomenology in the weak field limit can produce the necessary degree of gravitational lensing .",
    "the only other possibility for mond as modified gravity is , then , a multi - field theory such as teves .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to consider the constraints imposed upon multi - field theories of modified dynamics by solar system phenomenology .",
    "the precession of the orbits of mercury and icarus , as well as limits on the variation of kepler s constant , @xmath9 , between the earth and outer planets implies that the total force law within the orbit of neptune is inverse square to high precision , apart from those post - newtonian corrections introduced by gr .",
    "this suggests that any fifth force in the inner solar system , in addition to preserving the wep , is also precisely inverse square .",
    "moreover , the absence of detectable post - newtonian effects due to a scalar field tied to a cosmic rest frame , i.e. , ether - drift effects , probably constrains the magnitude of the fifth force to be less than @xmath10 that of the normal gravity force .",
    "but , in the context of mond , the anomalous force in the galaxy , at the neighbourhood of the sun , would have to be comparable to the gravity force .",
    "the transition from a weak inverse square attraction in the inner solar system to a significant anomalous attraction at several thousand astronomical units ( au ) would seem to require the appearance of a non - inverse square acceleration in the outer solar system .",
    "this is interesting in view of the fact that a deviation from inverse square attraction beyond 20 au is suggested on the basis of doppler data from the two pioneer spacecrafts , the pioneer anomaly ( anderson et al .",
    "1998 , 2001 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this apparently constant anomalous acceleration ( @xmath11 cm / s@xmath12 ) is tantalisingly close to , although significantly larger than , the mond acceleration ( turyshev , nieto & anderson 2005 ) .",
    "i show here that an anomalous acceleration is an expected , and indeed predicted , aspect of multi - field theories of modified dynamics .",
    "this non - inverse square acceleration appears in the outer solar system and need not be , but can be , as large as the observed pioneer acceleration .",
    "although the discussion is general , i illustrate this by considering current examples of multi - field theories of mond .",
    "teves , with bekenstein s initial trial free function , predicts a deviation which is too large to be consistent with both the reported constraints on @xmath13 and the probable limits on preferred frame effects .",
    "these contradictions are not fatal because the free function of the theory can be modified to produce an anomalous force consistent with the planetary and preferred frame constraints .",
    "indeed the form of the free function required is also consistent with that demanded by observations of extended galaxy rotation curves which are flat beyond the visible disk . in this case",
    "the predicted anomalous acceleration appears beyond 100 au and is roughly @xmath14 .",
    "the biscalar tensor vector theory ( bstv ) is a modification of teves constructed , in part , to be consistent with the constraints on deviations from inverse square attraction and with the non - detection of preferred frame effects near the earth .",
    "it also predicts a constant anomalous acceleration beyond uranus that depends upon the value of the scalar coupling strength . for values of the scalar field coupling constant below a critical value",
    "then the constant acceleration is also @xmath15 as in teves , but for larger couplings , the constant acceleration can be significantly larger than @xmath2 and extend within the orbit of neptune ; i.e. , the theory may be tuned to be consistent with the pioneer effect .",
    "if so , however , it is then inconsistent with the reported limits on deviations from @xmath16 attraction out to the orbit of neptune .",
    "this is unavoidable because if the pioneer effect is really present within 30 au , then it would be inconsistent with limits on variation of @xmath9 between the orbits of the inner planets and the orbit of uranus and neptune limits derived from spacecraft ranging to these two outer planets .",
    "either this constraint on deviations from @xmath16 in the outer solar system is too stringent , which is possible ( section 4.3 ) , or the reported pioneer anomaly has a standard explanation ( not involving fundamental physics ) .",
    "a more radical possibility is that the pioneer effect , and hence mond , is not due to a modification of gravity but of the particle action ( milgrom 1994 ) .",
    "i have emphasised that , in scalar - tensor theories of mond , the relation between the physical and gravitational metrics can not be conformal .",
    "this condition requires the introduction of a vector field , @xmath17 , that points in the time direction in the preferred cosmological frame .",
    "if the physical metric @xmath18 is related to the gravitational metric @xmath19 as @xmath20 then it may be shown that the scalar field enhances the deflection of photons about a visible astronomical system exactly as it would be by appropriately added dark matter in the context of pure gr ; i.e. , relativistic and non - relativistic particles feel the same total weak field force .",
    "( sanders 1997 , bekenstein 2004 ) . here",
    "@xmath21 is a parameter describing the strength of the scalar coupling to matter and is related to the parameter @xmath22 in bekenstein s notation ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "it is useful to discuss scalar - tensor theories of modified dynamics in the context of the einstein frame where the scalar field @xmath24 may be considered to mediate a force , @xmath25 , in addition to the usual gravity force connected to the gravitational tensor , the einstein - newton force @xmath26 ; that is to say , in this frame , particle motion is generally non - geodesic . in such theories the phenomenology associated with mond results from this `` fifth force '' which is , in the extragalactic domain , a non - inverse square force that dominates in the regime of low field gradients ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the aspect of non - inverse square attraction requires a departure from the standard lagrangian for scalar - tensor theories ( @xmath28 ) either in the form of the aquadratic theory with a non - standard scalar lagrangian ( @xmath29 ) or a biscalar theory where one field couples to matter and the second determines the strength of that coupling ( as in pcg ) .",
    "each of these prescriptions may be designed to provide to a scalar force about a point mass of the form @xmath30 at least in the regime where @xmath31 .",
    "the total weak field force would then be given by @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the usual newtonian force ; clearly @xmath25 given by eq",
    ".  2 will dominate at accelerations below @xmath2 .",
    "teves is an aquadratic theory in disguise , with a scalar field action that may be written as @xmath34 this is the weak coupling limit of pcg ( @xmath35 ) , the aqual limit , where one may show that the kinetic term for @xmath36 vanishes . as written here , @xmath36 is an auxiliary non - dynamical field and is algebraically related to @xmath37 via the potential function @xmath38 .",

    "5 does not have the same meaning as @xmath46 in the original mond prescription ( @xmath47 ) or in the single - field bekenstein - milgrom non - relativistic theory ( bekenstein 2004 ) .",
    "5 applies only to the scalar component of the force . in the context of such multi - field theories , not all forms of @xmath46",
    "are realisable from sensible single - valued forms of @xmath36 ( zhao & famaey 2005 ) .",
    "the most obvious , and simplest , choice for the free function would be @xmath48 or @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath51 and leads to a scalar force of the form of eq .  2 at all @xmath52 ;",
    "of course , the newtonian force dominates for @xmath53 .",
    "the rotation curves of spiral galaxies would be _ asymptotically _ flat as in mond and would satisfy a mass - rotation velocity relation ( tully - fisher ) of the form @xmath54 .",
    "we see below , however , that such a theory is inconsistent with the observed form of galaxy rotation curves as well as tight constraints on deviations from inverse square attraction in the inner solar system .",

    "5 differs by a factor of @xmath56 from bekenstein s definition ) .",
    "this yields a scalar force illustrated by the dotted curve in fig .  1 where we see a return to @xmath16 attraction at high accelerations ( here @xmath57 ) .",
    "for @xmath58 this is equivalent to scalar force dependence provided by eq .",
    ".    this free function , as well as that described by eq .",
    "6 , is unacceptable in that the form of the observed rotation curves of spiral galaxies implies that the scalar force can not continue to increase smoothly as @xmath59 for accelerations near @xmath2 ; the resulting rotation curves decline too slowly to the asymptotically constant value .",
    "this has been demonstrated for the milky way galaxy and for the well - studied spiral galaxy , ngc 3198 ( famaey & binney 2005 ) , and it is generally true ( zhao & famaey 2005 ) .",
    "2 shows the newtonian rotation curve ( solid curve ) resulting from a spherically symmetric mass distribution of galaxy scale mass ( @xmath60 ) , an exponential sphere with a length scale of 2 kpc .",
    "the dotted curve is the rotation curve resulting from teves with the free function described by eq .",
    "the slow decline to the asymptotic value is evident .    .",

    "would give rise to a radial dependence for the scalar force about a point mass of the form shown by the long dashed curve shown in fig .",
    "this is qualitatively similar to that originally suggested for the aquadratic stratified theory ( sanders 1997 ) and to the radial force dependence provided by the free function proposed by zhao & famaey ( 2006 ) ( short dashed curve ) .",
    "here we see that for total accelerations greater than @xmath2 the scalar force becomes constant , @xmath62 before resuming @xmath16 dependence at larger total accelerations .",
    "the mond interpolating function , @xmath46 ( for spherical symmetry ) corresponding to the free functions of bekenstein , zhao - famaey , and eq .  8 are shown in fig .",
    "3 . consistency with observed galaxy rotation curves requires a transition to the newtonian regime at least as rapid as that provided by the zhao - famaey free function .",
    "the relative merit of various free functions is not the topic here ; the point is that radial dependence of scalar force must become rather flat at accelerations larger than @xmath2 to be consistent with galaxy rotation curves .",
    "this is evident in fig .  2 where the rotation curve resulting from teves with the free function described by eq .  8",
    "is shown by the long dashed curve ; this is more consistent with observed rotation curves which are generally flat beyond the visible disk .",
    "as will be shown below , this same qualitative behaviour is also required to meet the constraints on deviations from inverse square attraction in the inner solar system while avoiding observable preferred frame effects .",
    "the bstv theory has been designed to produce a radial dependence of the scalar force similar in form to that given by teves with the modified free function , eq .",
    "8 , ( dashed curve in fig .  1 ) , and",
    "therefore , rotation curves of the observed form ( see fig .  1 and 2 in sanders 2005 )",
    ". there is , however , one important difference : because the field determining the strength of the scalar coupling in this theory , equivalent to @xmath36 , is dynamical ( unlike teves where it is an auxiliary field only ) the value of the constant scalar acceleration near @xmath63 depends not only upon the scalar coupling strength , @xmath21 , but also upon the value of the source mass and its distribution .",
    "this can make an important difference in outer solar system phenomenology .",
    "the most sensitive natural gravity probe in the inner solar system is provided by the orbit of mercury . as is well - known general relativity found its first experimental success in providing a non - newtonian explanation of the anomalous precession of this orbit .",
    "the precise prediction is @xmath64 per century , and the present observational result agrees with this to better than 0.05  per century ( will 2001 ) .",
    "that is to say , precession resulting from any additional non - newtonian effect must be less than this limit .",
    "this provides a strong constraint on long range fifth force models .    here",
    "i will parameterise an additional non - newtonian force in terms of a constant acceleration @xmath65 .",
    "it is straightforward to demonstrate that the precession introduced by such a constant acceleration would be given by @xmath66}^{1\\over 2 }   \\eqno(9)\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the eccentricity of the orbit and @xmath68 is the semi - major axis .",
    "this may be rewritten as @xmath69 where v is the mean orbital velocity . if , for mercury , @xmath70/century , eq .  10 would imply that @xmath71 cm / s@xmath12 .",
    "that is to say , any constant anomalous acceleration present at the distance of mercury from the sun , must be 200 times smaller than the reported pioneer acceleration .",
    "the precision of measured planetary precession degrades rapidly for the other terrestrial planets , but the asteroid , icarus , remains a useful probe because of its near earth passage ( @xmath72 au ) and its high eccentricity ( e=0.83 ) . here , the precession predicted from gr is 10.3 arc sec / century and the observed precession is @xmath73 arc sec / century ( weinberg 1972 ) . taking 0.8 arc sec / century as the limit on precession due to a constant acceleration we find , from eq .",
    "10 that @xmath74",
    "cm / s@xmath12 ,    beyond icarus , the tightest constraints on deviations from @xmath16 attraction are provided by limits on the variation of kepler s constant , @xmath75 .",
    "if a variation , @xmath76 is detected between two planetary orbits , and if this is parameterised by the presence of a constant acceleration , @xmath65 , then @xmath77 where @xmath78 and @xmath79 are the distances from the sun of the closer and more distant planets respectively ( assumed to be on circular orbits ) .",
    "an additional scalar force described by eq .",
    "2 ( in addition to the newtonian force ) would result in a variation of kepler s constant given by @xmath80 ( @xmath81 au ) .    since the advent of interplanetary spacecrafts , the distances to the planets are known to high accuracy .",
    "this provides strict limits on the variation of kepler s constant between the earth and the planet in question , i.e. , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the uncertainty in the period and @xmath84 is the uncertainty in the solar distance . for example , from the viking mission to mars it is known that the uncertainty in the difference in the orbital radii of earth and mars is less than 100 m. moreover , the difference in the orbital periods between the earth and mars is known to better than 7 parts in @xmath85 . by eq .",
    "13 this implies that @xmath86 and hence , from eq .",
    "11 , @xmath87 for any constant acceleration present between the orbits of the earth and mars ( anderson et al . 2002 ) .",
    "similar observational limits resulting from pioneer and voyager flybys constrain @xmath88 between the inner planets and jupiter , uranus and neptune to be less than .12 , 0.5 , 2.0 times @xmath89 respectively ( anderson et al .",
    "the corresponding limits on a constant acceleration are .26 , .08 , and .13 in units of @xmath90 cm/@xmath5 .",
    "we see that these limits for uranus and neptune are inconsistent with the reported pioneer anomaly if the anomaly is present at distances beyond 20 au .",
    "these results are summarised in table 1 .",
    "there is disagreement over these outer solar system constraints ( section 4.3 ) , but in any case , it is clear that the @xmath59 dependence of a fifth force can not continue into the inner solar system certainly not to within the orbit of mars ( @xmath91) because here the total gravitational field is so nearly inverse square . a force law of the form of eq .",
    "2 would result in @xmath92 ( eq .",
    "12 ) or 30000 times larger than the observed limit .",
    "this suggests that in teves the radial dependence of scalar force must be quite precisely @xmath16 certainly within the orbit of mars . as we see from fig .",
    "1 this is consistent with the free function given by eq .",
    "8 or by zhao & famaey forms which are also consistent with observed galaxy rotation curves .",
    "note that a theory can be constructed in which the net scalar force vanishes within @xmath2 .",
    "this is highly contrived ( involving two scalar components , one attractive and one repulsive ) , but implies that , in all that follows , one should add the condition that the scalar force is a monotonically decreasing function of radius .",
    ".planetary constraints on a constant anomalous acceleration [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the final column is the upper limit on a constant anomalous acceleration determined from planetary orbits via the indicated method ( @xmath93 , planetary precession ; @xmath88 , variation of kepler s constant ) .",
    "the constraints imposed by the orbits of uranus and neptune ( marked with asterisks ) are controversial ( see text ) , but if valid would be inconsistent with the pioneer anomaly as a modification of gravity .",
    "the distance given is the semi - major axis of the orbit ..      given that the total force must be quite precisely @xmath16 in the inner solar system , it is reasonable to suppose that the scalar force , in the high acceleration regime , is also @xmath16 as in brans - dicke theory .",

    "but , as noted in the introduction , because of the conformal relation between the physical and gravitational metrics , there is no enhanced deflection of photons due to the scalar field , while non - relativistic particles do respond to an enhanced force .",
    "this is reflected in the fact that the post - newtonian parameter @xmath104 in brans - dicke theory . in general , @xmath105 in in conformally coupled scalar - tensor theories .    a disformal transformation of the form of eq .  1 has been discussed by giannios ( 2005 ) in the context of teves .",
    "it is equivalent to multiplying different components of @xmath19 by separate functions of @xmath24 ; i.e. , @xmath106 and @xmath107 . in such theories ,",
    "it is the case that @xmath108 if @xmath109 ( see appendix ) . if both conditions 15 and 16 are met and if @xmath110 ( i.e. , the vector does not develop a non - zero radial component ) , then @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to verify that the particular transformation provided by eq .  1 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 , satisfies conditions 15 and 16 .",
    "therefore , for any tensor - vector - scalar theory in which the gravitational and physical metrics are related according to eq .  1 , there is no restriction on @xmath94 at post - newtonian level as described by the standard eddington - robertson parameters .",

    "these theories are consistent with a wide range of observed phenomena from deflection of starlight by the sun to radar echo delay .",

    "post - newtonian preferred frame effects in conservative theories are quantified by two parameters , @xmath115 and @xmath116 ( will & nordtvedt 1972 ) .",
    "these modify the effective lagrangian that describes the gravitational dynamics of n - body systems by adding terms such as @xmath117 and @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the velocity of particle a with respect to the preferred cosmic frame , @xmath120 is the velocity of the inertial frame with respect to the cosmic frame , and @xmath121 is the unit vector along @xmath122 . a non - zero value of @xmath115 would lead to effects such as a polarisation of the earth - moon orbit and is constrained to be less than @xmath10 by lunar laser ranging ( mller , nordtvedt & vokrouhlick 1996 ) .",

    "there is one dynamical field , @xmath24 , a non - dynamical tensor ( minkowski ) describing the background geometry , and a non - dynamical vector field ; that is to say , the gravitational force is supposed to be mediated only by the scalar field disformally coupled to an a priori geometry described by the minkowski metric . here",
    "it may be shown that @xmath124 but @xmath125 in sharp contradiction with the llr result , not to mention earlier constraints on the diurnal and annual variation of the the gravitational constant .",
    "in the predecessor to teves , the aquadratic stratified theory ( sanders 1997 ) , there are two dynamical fields , a scalar and the einstein metric , in addition to a non - dynamic vector field .",
    "that is to say , the gravitational force is mediated not only by the scalar field , but also by the einstein metric which is locally insensitive to motion through the cosmic frame . here",
    "the preferred frame effects would appear through the contribution of the scalar to the physical metric ( ala eq .  1 ) .",
    "in the limit where the scalar coupling , @xmath21 , vanishes , the theory reduces to gr and in gr there are no preferred frame effects . therefore observational limits on preferred frame effects must place an upper limit upon @xmath21 .",
    "this can be made more definite by noting that the equation of motion for the scalar field , in the high acceleration limit where the lagrangian is standard , has the form @xmath126_{;\\beta } = 4\\pi g\\eta\\tilde{t}_{\\mu\\nu}[g^{\\mu\\nu } +   ( 1+e^{-4\\eta\\phi } )   a^\\mu a^\\nu]\\eqno(19)\\ ] ] where @xmath127 is the usual energy momentum tensor in the physical frame ( bekenstein 2005 ) . in a frame moving with velocity @xmath128 with respect to the cosmic frame , the source , to order @xmath129 would take the form @xmath130 $ ] , but @xmath19 would contain no such terms to post - newtonian order . since @xmath131 , i conjecture that @xmath115 is suppressed , relative to its value in pure stratified theories , by @xmath132 .",
    "if so , this would constrain @xmath133    similar arguments would apply in a theory such as teves where all three fields , including the vector , are dynamical ; that is , we would expect post - newtonian preferred frame effects to project into the solar system via the scalar field which is tied to the cosmological frame .",
    "there is , however , an additional effect because the vector field contributes directly to the source of the einstein tensor , @xmath134 .",
    "this contribution is not negligible because of the presence , in the theory , of a lagrangian multiplier function included to enforce a normalisation condition on the vector field , @xmath135 .",
    "the additional term in the energy - momentum tensor is then @xmath136 which , from the vector field equation becomes @xmath137 where @xmath138 is a new parameter associated with the vector field ( a coupling strength parameter ) , and @xmath139 is the locally measured gravitational constant ( the primary effect of the vector field in the weak field limit is a rescaling of the gravitational constant with respect to its cosmological value , @xmath140 , i.e. , @xmath141 ) .",
    "therefore , given a lorentz transformation of the cosmic vector field to a moving frame we see that the source of @xmath134 contains terms proportional to @xmath142 .",
    "this would constrain k to be less than @xmath115 or @xmath116 ( say @xmath143 ) but would have no profound effect on weak field phenomenology .    in summary then , we can say that the suppression of the likely preferred frame effects such as polarisation of the earth - moon orbit will probably require that @xmath133 this is comparable to the current reported constraints on a scalar force in the context of brans - dicke theory ( bertotti et al . 2003 ) .",
    "but i re - emphasise , this is a heuristic argument and a proper calculation should be done .",
    "summarising the above discussion , we have seen , first of all , that the total weak field gravitational force in the solar system is inverse square to high precision , at least within the orbit of mars .",
    "this implies that any component of the gravitational force , in addition to the einstein - newton force , should also be precisely inverse square . at the same time",
    ", post - newtonian preferred frame effects would seem to require that any additional inverse square force due to a scalar field should be smaller than @xmath10 of the einstein - newton force .",
    "it is not trivial for a theory to satisfy these two constraints .      in teves , the relevant parameter , which determines the strength of the scalar force is @xmath21 ; i.e. , @xmath144 in the limit where @xmath145 .",
    "the preferred frame considerations would then require the @xmath146 . in fig .",
    "4 the dotted curve shows the anomalous force ( the non @xmath16 component of the total force ) resulting from bekenstein s initial free function ( eq .  7 ) , with @xmath57 , compared to the total force within the solar system ( dashed curve ) .",
    "the points are the limits on a constant anomalous acceleration from planetary motion discussed in section 2 .",
    "the solid bar represents the pioneer anomalous acceleration .",
    "here it is obvious that the theory , with this choice of free function and scalar coupling strength , strongly violates these limits on deviations from inverse square attraction well into the inner solar system .",
    "the deviation from inverse square attraction is less severe if the scalar coupling constant , @xmath21 is larger .",
    "the anomalous force resulting when @xmath147 is shown by the long dashed curve ; this would appear to be roughly consistent with the constraints on deviations from inverse square within the inner solar system .",
    "but then the scalar force is only 0.01 of the newton - einstein force , and the theory would probably evidence local preferred frame effects at least 100 times larger than the present limits .",
    "the modified form of the free function ( eq .  8) with @xmath57 , gives an anomalous force shown by the solid curve in fig .",
    "it is obvious that this is consistent both with the planetary constraints on deviations from @xmath16 attraction out to neptune and with the avoidance of local preferred frame effects required by @xmath148 , but a constant anomalous acceleration @xmath149 does appear beyond 100 au .",
    "bstv is in part designed to satisfy these solar system constraints but at the expense of adding a new parameter @xmath150 ( the parameter is not necessary an additional ; it may be identified with the vector coupling strength ) .",
    "here there are two explicitly dynamical scalar fields one , @xmath24 , that couples to matter and the second @xmath151 which determines the strength of the coupling . in terms of the scalar field gradient ,",
    "the quasi - static field equation is @xmath152 = { { 8\\pi g\\eta\\rho}\\over { c^2 } } \\eqno(20)\\ ] ] where @xmath153 in the high acceleration limit ; i.e. , @xmath151 saturates at a small value in this limit ( note that @xmath154 with @xmath36 as defined in eqs .  3 and 5 ) .",
    "given that @xmath21 is the strength of the scalar field coupling ( as in eq .  1 ) and that the scalar force is @xmath155 , the theory is designed to yield a precisely @xmath16 force in the inner solar system with @xmath156 in the limit where @xmath145 .",
    "thus , for this theory , the avoidance of preferred frame effects near the earth would require that @xmath157    but there is another significant difference with teves .",
    "the relation between the coupling strength field , @xmath151 , and the scalar force is no longer algebraic ( as in eqs .",
    "7 and 8) but is differential and given by @xmath158 where @xmath159 is now an effective potential involving the cosmic time derivative of the scalar field .",
    "it is instructive to view this equation in unit - less form by defining @xmath160 and @xmath161 with @xmath162 ( @xmath163 is the schwarzschild radius ) . given that @xmath164 in this regime ( @xmath165 ) , that @xmath166 , and that @xmath167 , then , in the case of spherical symmetry , eq .  21 becomes @xmath168 from this it is obvious that , in the limit of weak coupling , where @xmath169 , the relationship between @xmath170 and @xmath171 is effectively algebraic as in teves ( the theory approaches its aqual limit ) . in this case",
    "the radial dependence of the scalar force is similar to that shown in fig .   1 ( dashed curves ) .",
    "this is consistent with galaxy rotation curves and would produce an anomalous acceleration in the solar system similar to that of fig .  4 ( solid curve ) ; i.e. , it satisfies all planetary constraints on deviations from @xmath16 attraction .    for a given value of @xmath21",
    "the condition for weak coupling provides a lower limit on the source mass .",
    "whenever @xmath172 then the weak coupling limit applies ( here @xmath173 is the hubble radius and i have taken @xmath174 ) . if @xmath175 this critical mass would correspond to a few solar masses . in other words , for larger mass",
    ", the weak coupling limit applies , and the form of the scalar force ( as a function of @xmath176 ) is frozen as in teves .",
    "but for smaller masses , the full differential equation ( eq .  22 ) must be solved and the solution depends upon the source mass ( the presence of a critical mass in pcg was pointed out by bekenstein 1988 ) .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "5 where we see the scalar force as a function of the scaled radius ( @xmath176 ) for @xmath177 and for various values of the source mass .",
    "the object is placed in the galaxy acceleration field near the position of the sun where @xmath165 ( the scalar force is comparable to the newtonian force at large distance from the star ) . here ,",
    "if @xmath178 , the solution is fixed at the weak - coupling limit . for smaller values of the mass ,",
    "the solution , and in particular the value of the plateau acceleration , depends upon the source mass .",
    "if the source mass is @xmath179 , then the plateau acceleration is @xmath180 cm / s@xmath12 .",
    "that is to say , unlike the weak coupling or aqual limit , the constant anomalous acceleration in the outer solar system can be significantly larger than the mond critical acceleration .    with @xmath181 and @xmath182 ( sanders 2005 ) , the resulting anomalous force ( solid curve )",
    "is compared to the total force ( dashed curve ) in fig .",
    "it is evident that , within 20 au the scalar force is precisely @xmath16 and @xmath10 less than the newtonian force .",
    "moreover , the theory in this form produces a constant anomalous force that is consistent with the pioneer acceleration but inconsistent with the the reported limits the variation of kepler s constant out to uranus and neptune .",
    "taking the parameters of the theory to be @xmath183 and @xmath184 pushes the theory back to the aqual limit and produces the anomalous force shown as the dotted curve .",
    "this is consistent with all reported planetary constraints on inverse square attraction and preferred frame effects as is teves with the revised free function .",
    "in fact , it is identical in this respect to teves with the revised free function ( eq .",
    "teves with the free function modified to be consistent with galaxy rotation curves ( as in eq .",
    "8) predicts a constant anomalous acceleration beyond 100 au with magnitude @xmath185 cm / s@xmath12 . the same is true of bstv in the limit of weak scalar coupling , @xmath186 .",
    "therefore the theories may be constructed to be consistent both with galaxy rotation curves and with planetary constraints on @xmath16 attraction within the orbit of neptune . in any case ,",
    "an anomalous acceleration , @xmath65 , in the outer solar system is inevitable , provided that the scalar force is a monotonically decreasing function of radius .",
    "consistency with galaxy rotation curves appears to require that @xmath187 as a lower limit . for bstv , however , because the field determining the effective strength of the scalar coupling , @xmath151 ( or @xmath36 ) is dynamical , it is possible that @xmath188 beyond 20 au while , in the outskirts of galaxies @xmath187 .",
    "the same would probably be true of teves with a dynamical @xmath36 .",
    "it is therefore tempting to identify the predicted constant acceleration with the pioneer anomaly .",
    "this is problematic because , as we see in fig .",
    "5 , the pioneer anomaly itself is inconsistent with reported limits on the variation of kepler s constant out to uranus and neptune ( anderson et al .",
    ". however , these stated limits may be overly stringent because they are based only upon single spacecraft ranging measurements to these planets , and the formal uncertainties in the distances are almost certainly too optimistic .",
    "it should also be kept in mind that both uranus and neptune have not completed a single orbit period since the advent of precise astronomical positioning instrumentation , and , therefore , their orbits are poorly known ( standish 2004 and private communication 2005 ) .",
    "more recently , it has been claimed that such a large anomalous acceleration , if present beyond 20 au , would lead to secular and short period signals in the orbits of the outer three planets signals large enough to have been detected given the present levels of accuracy ( iorio 2006 ) .",
    "the opposite conclusion has been reached by page , dixon and walen ( 2005 ) who propose using distant asteroid orbits as a test for the pioneer effect .",
    "it would seem fair to conclude that there is an lack of agreement about the nature of the gravitational field ( as probed by planetary orbits ) in the outer solar system .",
    "this is an important issue .",
    "if planetary motion beyond 20 au is inconsistent with the presence of the constant pioneer acceleration , then the pioneer anomaly is not due to a modification of gravity in the usual sense .",
    "if the planetary motion is consistent with the pioneer anomaly , then it remains possible that this reported constant acceleration is due to the effect of a fifth force which becomes evident at low accelerations , as in relativistic theories of mond .",
    "solar system phenomenology , in particular the tight limits on deviations from inverse square attraction and the absence to high precision of local preferred frame effects , places strong constraints on multi - field theories of modified dynamics as modified gravity .",
    "specifically , any fifth force mediated by a scalar field must also be inverse square to high precision in the inner solar system , at least within the orbit of mars , but smaller than about @xmath10 of the newton - einstein force to avoid producing observable preferred frame effects .",
    "i re - emphasise that this constraint upon the magnitude of the scalar force is only an estimate based upon heuristic arguments ; a proper calculation of the preferred frame post - newtonian parameters for teves should be done .",
    "it is clear , however , that in these theories preferred frame effects , such as a polarisation of the lunar orbit , should appear at some level .    in the galaxy , at the position of the sun , the galactic gravitational acceleration is on the order of mond acceleration @xmath189 cm / s@xmath12 . in the context of multi - field theories of mond",
    "this would imply that a fifth force acceleration is probably about as large as the newtonian acceleration , or , in terms of scalar - tensor theory , @xmath190 .",
    "in other words , @xmath94 must grow from 0.0001 within the orbit of neptune to about one at a distance of 800 au where the galactic gravitational acceleration becomes comparable to the solar attraction . therefore , going outward from the sun to the galactic environment , the scalar force must appear as an anomalous non - inverse square acceleration ( provided that the scalar force dependence on radius is monotonic ) .",
    "this effect , first noted for the stratified aquadratic theory ( sanders 1997 ) , is an inevitable consequence of multi - field theories and is evidenced both by teves and bstv .    in order to meet the solar system constraints of precise inverse square attraction and the absence of preferred frame effects",
    "the scalar force must have the form demonstrated by the dashed curves in fig .  1 ; i.e. , there must be a transition region between @xmath59 and @xmath16 attraction where the acceleration due to the scalar field is more - or - less constant .",
    "therefore , not only must an anomalous acceleration appear in the outer solar system ( certainly beyond 100 au ) but it must also be , to lowest order , constant with radius between 100 and 1000 au .    both bstv and teves with the modified free function can provide this transition , but there is an important difference . in bstv , it may be shown that for vanishing coupling strength ( @xmath191 ) the laplacian of @xmath151 , the coupling strength field , may be neglected in the field equation for @xmath151 , and the theory becomes , in effect , an aquadratic theory as in teves . however , for finite @xmath21 the form of @xmath151 and hence the scalar force , in general , depends upon the mass of the source and the coupling strength . for @xmath192",
    "the aqual limit applies to galaxy scale masses but the full differential equation must be solved for smaller masses .",
    "the practical consequence of this is that the plateau acceleration ( where @xmath193 ) depends upon the source mass . for a galaxy scale mass",
    "this near constant acceleration can be @xmath15 ( as required for rotation curves ) but for a solar mass it may be near @xmath194 if @xmath195 .",
    "this possibility exists for teves as well if the auxiliary field , @xmath36 , is given its own dynamics by writing a kinetic term proportional to @xmath196 into the lagrangian ( this would provide a more familiar theory ) .",
    "therefore it is possible that the the predicted constant anomalous force could be identified with the pioneer anomaly .",
    "but it is also evident from figs .  4 and 6 that no theory of mond as modified gravity can satisfy the reported limits on deviation from inverse square attraction at the orbits of uranus and neptune and be consistent with the pioneer effect",
    "if the anomalous acceleration really does appear at radii as small as 20 au .",
    "this is because the pioneer effect itself is inconsistent with these constraints .",
    "the constraints themselves are controversial .",
    "basically , the solar gravitational field in the outer solar system is not well - understood , and this calls for a reconsideration of the orbits of the outer planets in the presence of a non - inverse square acceleration .",
    "it should also be noted that milgrom ( 1994 ) has proposed a basis for mond as modified inertia in which the particle action is a non - local functional of the entire particle trajectory .",
    "this is a completely different approach from the modified gravity theories discussed here , and could account for the possibility that the pioneer spacecrafts on hyperbolic orbits feel the anomalous acceleration but the planets on more circular orbits do not .",
    "for this reason , it would be of considerable interest to determine if the pioneer anomaly first appears at the point where a spacecraft is boosted from a bound to an unbound orbit .    the significance of the pioneer effect should not be understated .",
    "it may constitute the first evidence on a scale smaller than galactic and extra - galactic that there is more to gravity than we have supposed .",
    "the question of whether or not the pioneer acceleration is a new physical effect and , if so , where the anomalous acceleration first appears requires reanalysis of the existing pioneer data and , on the longer term , new space missions to confirm ( or not ) this important result ( turyshev , nieto & anderson 2004 ) .",
    "the possibility of such local tests is , in a sense , the `` holy grail '' of modified gravity theories ( as is the direct detection of new particles for dark matter theories ) . in this",
    "regard , bekenstein and magueijo ( 2006 ) have demonstrated that , in the context of teves , mond tidal stresses become anomalous large near saddle points in the local solar system where the total weak field force approaches zero , between the earth and the sun , for example .",
    "space missions with sensitive accelerometers might detect such effects . this would indeed be a spectacular confirmation , but non - detection at the predicted level would not be a falsification of general modified gravity theories for mond . in the biscalar theory , for example , the coupling strength field ,",
    "also being dynamical , does not respond immediately to changes in the scalar force ; once in the deep newtonian regime , one can not return to the mond regime over relatively small distances . on the other hand , it does appear that any theory of mond as modified gravity would require the presence of an anomalous acceleration in the outer solar system ( beyond 100 au ) with a magnitude of at least a few tenths @xmath2 .",
    "i am grateful to jacob bekenstein , moti milgrom , and dimitrios giannios for very useful comments on this manuscript .",
    "i also thank slava turyshev for helpful remarks on the pioneer anomaly and miles standish for comments on planetary constraints on the solar gravitational field .",
    "let us suppose that , in the preferred frame , the relation between @xmath197 and @xmath198 ( the time - time components of the physical and einstein metrics ) can be written as @xmath199 where @xmath200 is a general function of @xmath24 , the scalar field .",
    "further take the taylor expansion @xmath201 where @xmath202 and @xmath203 .",
    "if the scalar field dynamics is described by the standard field lagrangian , as it is for these theories in the inner solar system ( i.e. , @xmath204 then it is the case that @xmath205 as is usual in scalar - tensor theories . taking @xmath206 where , to second order @xmath207 then we find , to second order @xmath208 redefining the mass @xmath209",
    ", we then have @xmath210.\\eqno(a7)\\ ] ] by identification with eq .",
    "14 we find @xmath211 the condition for @xmath212 is then @xmath213 or @xmath214 this is obviously true if @xmath215 which would be the case for the particular transformation described by eq .  1 .    for a conformal transformation it is also the case that @xmath216 .",
    "repeating the procedure above for @xmath217 to first order , we find @xmath218 ( given that @xmath219 this returns the usual brans - dicke result ) .",
    "now suppose the transformation is disformal , and of a form which generalises eq .  1 : @xmath220 where @xmath221 and @xmath222 are unspecified functions of the scalar field . to post - newtonian order this is equivalent to multiplying the time - time and space - space components of @xmath19 by different functions of the scalar field , e.g. , @xmath106 and @xmath223 where @xmath224 and @xmath225 taking @xmath226 and repeating the above procedure for @xmath217 we find @xmath227 here @xmath108 if @xmath228 or @xmath229    rewriting conditions a9 and a16 in terms of the functions @xmath230 and @xmath128 ( via eqs . 12 and 13 ) we find that if @xmath231 ^ 2 = u''(0)+w''(0)\\eqno(a17)\\ ] ] and @xmath232 then @xmath111 it is straightforward to confirm that the particular transformation given by eq .",
    "1 satisfies these two conditions .",
    "it is important to note that giannios ( 2005 ) has found two spherically symmetric static solutions for teves : one in which @xmath114 everywhere ( as assumed here ) , and a second in which the vector field develops a non zero - radial component . in this second case @xmath233 and depends upon the vector coupling strength parameter and the cosmological value of the scalar field .",
