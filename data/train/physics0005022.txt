    "to achieve the required luminosity in a future e@xmath0e@xmath1 linear collider one has to produce two colliding beams at the interaction point ( ip ) with extremely small transverse beam dimensions . according to the linear collider design principles described in ref . 1",
    ", the normalized beam emittance in the vertical plane ( the normalized beam emittance in the horizontal plane is larger ) at ip can be expressed as : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the normalized beam energy , @xmath4 m is the classical electron radius , @xmath5 is the fine structure constant , @xmath6 is the maximum tolerable beamstrahlung energy spread , and @xmath7 is the mean number of beamstrahlung photons per electron at ip . taking @xmath8 and @xmath9 , one finds @xmath10mrad . to produce beams of this",
    "small transverse emittance damping rings seem to be the only known facilities which have the potential to do this job .",
    "the questions now are that once a beam of this small emittance is produced at the exit of the damping ring , how about the emittance growth during the long passage through the accelerating structures and the focusing channels from the damping ring at the beam energy of few gev to the ip with the beam energy of a few hundred of gev , and how to preserve it ?",
    "many works have been dedicated to answer these questions @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite . to start with , in sections 2 , 3 , and 4",
    ", we consider the short range wakefield induced single bunch emittance growth and try to calculate the emittance growth by using two different methods , and show that the two methods give the same results . since the number of accelerating structures in the main linac of a linear collider is very large , the transverse random kicks on the particles can be described statistically .",
    "firstly , we make use of the analogy between the transverse motion of a particle in a linear accelerator with the brownian motion of a molecule , which are governed by langevin equation . secondly , we solve directly fokker - planck equation . what should be noted",
    "is that both methods are physically consistent . as a natural extension",
    ", multibunch case is treated in section 5 .",
    "comparisons with some numerical simulation results are made in section 6 .",
    "the differential equation of the transverse motion of a bunch with zero transverse dimension is given as : @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the instantaneous betatron wave number at position @xmath14 , @xmath15 denotes the particle longitudinal position inside the bunch , and @xmath16 .",

    "we consider the case where the injected bunch , quadrupoles and beam position monitors are well aligned , while the accelerating structures are misaligned . as a consequence",
    ", @xmath24 is a random variable exactly the same as random accelerating structure misalignment errors with @xmath25 ( @xmath26 @xmath27 denotes the average over @xmath14 ) . if we take @xmath15 as a parameter and regard @xmath28 , @xmath13 , and @xmath29 as adiabatical variables with respect to @xmath14 , eq .",
    "[ eq:2 ] can be regarded as langevin equation which governs the brownian motion of a molecule .",
    "to make an analogy between the movement of the transverse motion of an electron and that of a molecule , we define @xmath30 , and regard @xmath31 as the particle s `` velocity '' random increment ( @xmath32 ) over the distance @xmath33 , where @xmath33 is the accelerating structure length . what we are interested is to assume that the random accelerating structure misalignment error follows gaussian distribution : @xmath34 and the velocity ( @xmath35 ) distribution of the molecule follows maxwellian distribution : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the molecule s mass , @xmath38 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath39 is the absolute temperature .",
    "the fact that the molecule s velocity follows maxwellian distribution permits us to get the distribution function for @xmath40 @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 by comparing eq .",
    "[ eq:7b ] with eq .",
    "[ eq:7a ] , one gets : @xmath43 or @xmath44 till now one can use all the analytical solutions concerning the random motion of a molecule governed by eq .",

    "[ eq:7 ] , [ eq:9 ] , and [ eq:9a ] one finds that there are three convenient types of variations of @xmath13 with respect to @xmath14 .",

    "the bunch emittance can be still expressed by eq .",
    "[ eq:9a ] with @xmath68 replaced by @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the center of the bunch .",

    ". [ eq:22 ] is the same as what we have obtained in eq .",
    "in fact , by solving directly fokker - planck equation we obtain the same set of asymptotical formulae derived in section 3 .",
    "physically , the multibunch emittance growth is quite similar to that of the single bunch case , and each assumed point like bunch in the train can be regarded as a slice in the previously described single bunch .",

    "[ eq:9a ] should be a good starting point for us to estimate the emittance growth of the whole bunch train . before making use of eq .",
    "[ eq:9a ] let s first look at the differential equation which governs the transverse motions of the bunch train : @xmath101 where the subscript @xmath102 denotes the bunch number , @xmath103 is the distance between two adjacent bunches , @xmath104 is the particle number in each bunch , @xmath105 is the long range wakefield produced by each point like bunch at distance of @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , the behaviour of the @xmath106 bunch suffers from influences coming from all the bunches before it , and we will treat one bunch after another in an iterative way .",
    "first of all , we discuss about the long range wakefields . due to the decoherence effect in the long range wakefield only the first dipole mode will be considered . for a constant impedance structure as shown in fig . 1",
    ", one has : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the rms bunch length ( @xmath108 is used to calculate the transverse wake potential , and the point charge assumption is still valid ) , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are the angular frequency and the loaded quality factor of the dipole mode , respectively .",

    "[ eq:777 ] can be calculated analytically as @xcite : @xmath112 @xmath113 @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the cavity radius , @xmath116 is the iris radius , @xmath117 is the cavity hight as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] , and @xmath118 is the first root of the first order bessel function .    \\2 .",
    "true cm    -7.5 true cm    to reduce the long range wakefield one can detune and damp the concerned dipole mode .",
    "the resultant long range wakefield of the detuned and damped structure ( dds ) can be expressed as : @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the number of the cavities in the structure .",
    "when @xmath120 is very large one can use following formulae to describe ideal uniform and gaussian detuning structures @xcite : 1 ) uniform detuning : @xmath121 2 ) gaussian detuning : @xmath122 where @xmath123 , @xmath124 , @xmath125 is full range the synchronous frequency spread due to the detuning effect , @xmath126 is the @xmath127 width in gaussian frequency distribution .",
    "once the long range wakefield is known one can use eq .",
    "[ eq:7 ] to estimate @xmath128 in an iterative way , and the emittance of the whole bunch can be calculated accordingly as we will show later .",
    "for example , if a bunch train is injected on axis ( @xmath129 ) into the main linac of a linear collider with structure _ rms _ misalignment @xmath130 , at the end of the linac one has : @xmath131 @xmath132 @xmath133 and in a general way , one has : @xmath134 finally , one can use the following formula to estimate the projected emittance of the bunch train : @xmath135 where @xmath136 ( since the bunch to bunch energy spread has been ignored ) , and @xmath137 is the average over the linac .",
    "it is high time now for us to point out that the analytical expressions for the single and multibunch emittance growths established above give the statistical results of infinite number of machines with gaussian structure misalignment error distribution , which corresponds to using infinite seeds in numerical simulations .",
    "to start with , we take the single bunch emittance growth in the main linac of sblc @xcite for example .",

    "[ eq:9a ] , one finds @xmath146 . if accelerating structure misalignment error @xmath147 @xmath143 m , one gets a normalized emittance growth of 8.66@xmath148 mrad , i.e. , 35@xmath149 increase compared with the designed normalized emittance of @xmath150 mrad .",
    "the analytical result agrees quite well with that obtained from numerical simulations @xcite .",
