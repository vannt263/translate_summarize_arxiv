    "an enhancement in the total @xmath9 annihilation cross - section into hadrons was discovered at cesr long ago @xcite , @xcite and @xcite and its mass measured as 10.865@xmath100.008 gev .",
    "this effect was named the @xmath0(5s ) resonance .",
    "potential models @xcite , @xcite and @xcite predict the different relative decay rates of the @xmath0(5s ) into combinations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 where @xmath13 indicates the possible presence or absence of a @xmath14 meson . some data , @xmath15 116 pb@xmath1 , failed to reveal if @xmath3 mesons were produced .",
    "it is important to check the predictions of these and other models ; furthermore , @xmath9  b factories \" could exploit a possible @xmath3 yield here as they have done for @xmath5 mesons on the @xmath0(4s ) . in this paper",
    "we examine @xmath4 yields because in a simple spectator model the @xmath3 decays into the @xmath4 nearly all the time .",
    "since the @xmath16 branching ratio has already been measured to be @xmath17 @xcite , we expect a large difference between the @xmath4 yields at the @xmath0(5s ) and the @xmath0(4s ) that can lead to an estimate of the size of the @xmath6 component at the @xmath0(5s ) .",
    "when we discuss the @xmath0(5s ) here , we mean the production of any @xmath5 meson species including @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath3 that occurs at an @xmath9 center - of - mass energy of 10.87 gev .",
    "the cleo iii detector is well equipped to measure the momenta and directions of charged particles , identify charged hadrons , detect photons and measure with good precision their directions and energies .",
    "muons above 1.1 gev can also be identified .",
    "the detector is almost cylindrically symmetric with everything but the muon detector inside a superconducting magnet coil run at a current that produces an almost uniform 1.5 t field .",
    "the detector consists of a four - layer double sided silicon strip detector at small radius .",
    "it is followed by a 47-layer drift chamber that uses a gas mixture of 60% helium and 40% propane .",
    "these two devices measure charged track vertices and three - momenta with excellent accuracy .",
    "the drift chamber also measures energy loss , de / dx , that is used to identify charged tracks below about 0.7 gev / c .",
    "after the drift chamber there is a ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich ) @xcite , that separates pions from kaons from threshold up to about 2.7 gev / c .",
    "the rich is surrounded by a thallium doped csi crystal array consisting of about 8000 tapered crystals 30 cm long and about 5x5 @xmath20 at the rear .",
    "in this analysis we use 0.42 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity representing all the data taken right at the @xmath0(5s ) peak .",
    "we also use 6.34 fb@xmath1 of integrated luminosity collected on the @xmath0(4s ) and 2.32 fb@xmath1 of data taken in the continuum 30 mev in center - of - mass energy below the @xmath0(4s ) for continuum subtraction .",
    "we looked for @xmath4 candidates through the reconstruction of three charged tracks in hadronic events via the @xmath21 decay mode . here and elsewhere in this paper mention of one charge",
    "implies the same consideration for the charge - conjugate mode .",
    "since @xmath22-quark events are relatively isotropic compared to continuum background events , these latter ones are suppressed by requiring that the fox - wolfram shape parameter @xmath23 @xcite is less than @xmath24 .",
    "the tracks are required to be well measured with momenta between @xmath25 and @xmath26 and have at least @xmath27 of the expected number of hits .",
    "each track should also have distance of closest approach to the interaction vertex in the bending plane @xmath28 @xmath29 and have a @xmath30 coordinate of the point of closest approach in the bending ( @xmath31 ) plane less or equal to @xmath32 @xmath33 .",
    "we use both charged particle ionization loss in the drift chamber ( de / dx ) and rich information to identify kaons and pions .",
    "the rich is used for momenta larger than 0.62 gev .",
    "information on the angle of detected cherenkov photons is translated into a likelihood of a given photon being due to a particular particle .",
    "contributions from all photons associated with a particular track are then summed to form an overall likelihood denoted as @xmath34 for each  @xmath35 \" particle hypothesis . to differentiate between pion and kaon candidates , we use the difference : @xmath36 ) .    to utilize the de / dx information we calculate the differences between the expected ionization losses and the observed losses divided by the error for the pion and kaon cases called @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "we use both the rich and de / dx information in the following manner : ( a ) if neither the rich nor de / dx information is available , then the track is accepted as both a pion and a kaon candidate .",
    "( b ) if de / dx is available and rich is not , then we insist that pion candidates have @xmath39 and kaon candidates have @xmath40 ( c ) if rich information is available and de / dx is not available , then we require that @xmath41 for pions and @xmath42 for kaons .",
    "( d ) if both de / dx and rich information are available , we require that @xmath43 for pions and @xmath44 for kaons .",
    "@xmath45 candidates are searched for in the @xmath46@xmath47 decay mode using the @xmath48 channel .",
    "pairs of oppositely charged tracks were considered as candidates for the decay products of the @xmath46 if each track passes the previous selection criteria ( except the particle identification cut where just one of the kaons is required to pass ) , and if the invariant mass of the @xmath49 system was within @xmath50 @xmath51 of the nominal @xmath46 mass . a third track passing the track selection requirements ( listed above ) except the particle identification cuts",
    "was combined with the @xmath49 system to form a @xmath4 candidate .    to suppress combinatoric backgrounds , we take advantage of the polarization of the @xmath46 as it is a vector particle while the other particles are spinless .",
    "the expected distribution from real @xmath46 decays varies as @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the angle between the @xmath4 and the @xmath54 momenta measured in the @xmath46 rest frame while combinatoric backgrounds tend to be flat .",
    "thus , we require @xmath55 to be larger than @xmath56 .",
    "for @xmath57 combinations satisfying the previous requirements , we look for @xmath4 candidates having a momentum less than or equal to half of the beam energy . instead of momentum we choose to work with the variable @xmath58 which is the @xmath4 momentum divided by the beam energy , to remove at first order differences between continuum data taken just below the @xmath0(4s ) , at the @xmath0(4s ) and at the @xmath0(5s ) .",
    "since we are interested in calculating the @xmath4 yields versus @xmath58 , we fit the invariant mass of the @xmath59 candidates in 10 different @xmath58 intervals ( from 0 to 0.5 ) for data taken at the @xmath0(4s ) peak , at the continuum below the @xmath0(4s ) and at the @xmath0(5s ) peak as shown in fig .",

    "some @xmath58 intervals did not have enough statistics to allow floating the fitting function parameters in each of our three data samples .",
    "thus we fixed the width of the gaussian signal shapes by fitting the large @xmath0(4s ) data sample in each @xmath58 interval allowing the width to float .",
    "then we fixed the widths to these values when fitting at the other energies .",
    "the raw @xmath4 yields extracted from the fitting are shown in fig .",

    "we note , that the data below the @xmath60 represent four - flavor continuum events containing @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 quarks . to determine the scale factor , @xmath65 we used two different methods , the first one accounts for both the ratio of luminosities and the @xmath63 dependence of the continuum cross section . here",
    "@xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 are the collected luminosities and the center of mass energies at the resonance @xmath71 and at the continuum below the @xmath0(4s ) .",
    "we find @xmath72 and the scale factor between the continuum below the @xmath0(4s ) and the @xmath0(5s ) : @xmath73    the systematic errors use the absolute errors on the luminosity determination at each energy .",
    "they are clearly conservative as part of this error will cancel since we are concerned only with the error in the luminosity ratio . to estimate the systematic error in an independent manner ,",
    "we do a second measurement of these scale factors using the data and take the difference between the two values as an estimate the systematic error . in this method we measure the number of charged tracks between @xmath74 for each of the three data sets .",
    "the ratio of tracks @xmath0(4s)/continuum gives @xmath75 and for @xmath0(5s)/continuum @xmath76 , both with a negligible statistical error .",
    "these numbers differ by 1.0% and 1.7% from the previous method and we take these differences as the systematic errors . thus we use @xmath77 @xmath78 the four - flavor continuum subtracted @xmath4 yields at the @xmath0(4s ) and @xmath0(5s ) are listed in the fourth column of tables 1 and 2 , respectively .      in order to convert the fitted event numbers into branching ratios , we have simulated both @xmath0(4s ) and @xmath0(5s ) @xmath79 and @xmath80 decays that have @xmath4 mesons in the final state .",
    "we reconstructed the simulated @xmath4 as we did for the data and we fitted the invariant mass to a gaussian signal and a polynomial background shape .",

    "[ efficiency ] .",
    "the efficiencies of two datasets are consistent with each other and since there is no reason to believe that they differ , in what follows we assume they are equal .    the @xmath58 dependent @xmath4 yields extracted from the fit of the @xmath0(4s ) and @xmath0(5s ) simulated events are shown in fig .

    "we know that the preliminary @xmath100 branching ratio we measure @xmath101 comes either from the the @xmath102 or from the @xmath103 piece if it manages to create an @xmath104 pair through fragmentation as shown in fig .",
    "[ btods](a ) and fig .",

    "[ bstods](a ) when the @xmath102 and these two quarks form a color singlet pair .",

    "we can use data to give us a guide to these processes .",
    "the @xmath108 modes have branching fractions that sum to about @xmath109 . the observations of such @xmath5 decays together with the consideration of some additional decays due to both measured and unmeasured @xmath110 and @xmath111 decays , lead to an estimate of an extra ( @xmath112 of @xmath4 mesons in @xmath3 decays into @xmath113 final state .",
    "however , it is possible that some @xmath4 are lost from these processes since any @xmath114 pairs in fig.[bstods](a ) and fig.[bstods](b ) could fragment into a kaon with a @xmath107 particle instead of a @xmath4 by producing a @xmath115 or @xmath116 .",
    "we do nt actually know the size of the fragmentation though it s clear that producing a light quark - antiquark pair ( @xmath116 or @xmath115 ) is easier than @xmath104 .",
    "therefore , reducing the yield from the @xmath106 transition due to fragmentations is estimated to be a @xmath117 effect .",
    "thus we get a model dependent estimate of @xmath118 , @xmath119    we can estimate now the fraction of the @xmath0(5s ) that decays into @xmath99 , which we denote as @xmath120 .",

    "the systematic errors in this analysis have a large component due to the @xmath126 error on the absolute @xmath127 branching fraction .",
