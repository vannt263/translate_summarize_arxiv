    "the mediation of supersymmetry breaking to the observable sector via supersymmetric gauge interactions ( gmsb ) has already been proposed during the very early days of supersymmetric model building @xcite .",
    "the essential ingredients of this class of models are a sequestered sector containing a spurion or a dynamical superfield @xmath4 , whose @xmath5-component @xmath6 does not vanish ( there could exist several such fields ) . in addition , a messenger sector @xmath7 exists , whose fields have a supersymmetric mass @xmath8 , but a mass splitting between its scalar / pseudoscalar components due to its coupling to @xmath6 .",
    "they carry standard model gauge quantum numbers such that the messengers couple to the standard model gauge supermultiplets .",
    "possible origins of supersymmetry breaking in the form of a nonvanishing @xmath6 component can be oraifeartaigh - type models @xcite , models based on no - scale supergravity @xcite or dynamical supersymmetry breaking @xcite .    if supersymmetric gauge interactions would be the only interactions that couple the visible sector with the messenger / sequestered sector , the phenomenologically required @xmath0 and @xmath9 terms of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) would be difficult to generate . the simplest solution to this problem",
    "is the introduction of a gauge singlet superfield @xmath10 and a superpotential including the @xmath11 term , which has been used in early globally @xcite and locally supersymmetric @xcite models .",
    "let us point out a possible connection between gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking and gmsb - like models",
    "@xcite : standard gravity mediated supersymmetry breaking within the mssm requires giudice - masiero - like terms ( depending on the higgs doublets ) in the khler potential @xcite in order to generate the @xmath0 and @xmath9 terms ( see @xcite for a possible 5-dimensional origin of such terms ) .",
    "given a possible source for such terms , one can replace the higgs doublets by the messengers of gmsb models and proceed as in the usual analysis of gauge mediation .",
    "the advantage of such models is that _ no other _ gravity mediated source of supersymmetry breaking as scalar or gaugino soft masses is required ; such sources of supersymmetry breaking are frequently absent in higher dimensional setups . on the other hand , the solution of the standard @xmath0-problem for the higgs doublets still requires the introduction of a singlet @xmath10 .",
    "then one is also led to the scenario considered in this paper , the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking .    in order to generate a sufficiently large vacuum expectation value of the scalar component @xmath12 of @xmath10 ( and hence a sufficiently large effective @xmath0 term @xmath13 ) ,",
    "the singlet superfield @xmath10 should possess additional yukawa interactions with the messenger / sequestered sector .",
    "then , an effective potential for @xmath12 with the desired properties can be radiatively generated .",
    "note that the so - called singlet tadpole problem @xcite is absent once the original source of supersymmetry breaking is of the @xmath5-type @xcite . on the contrary ,",
    "singlet tadpole diagrams can now generate the desired structure of the singlet effective potential @xcite , triggering a vev of @xmath12 . if the singlet couples at lowest possible loop order to the messenger / sequestered sector such that tadpole diagrams are allowed , a mild version of the singlet tadpole problem reappears , since the coefficients of the corresponding terms linear in @xmath12 are typically too large .",
    "this milder problem can be solved under the assumption that the involved yukawa coupling is sufficiently small  however , it does not need to be smaller than the electron yukawa coupling of the standard model ( see below ) .    in the meantime , quite a large number of models involving gmsb and at least one gauge singlet , that generates an effective @xmath0 term ,",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "they differ in the particle content of the messenger / sequestered sector , and include sometimes more than one gauge singlet superfield .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is the investigation of a large class of models obtained after integrating out the messenger / sequestered sector ( including possibly heavy singlet fields ) .",
    "it is assumed that the remaining particle content with masses below the messenger scale @xmath8 is the one of the nmssm .",
    "the couplings and mass terms of the nmssm are obtained under the following assumptions: no interactions between the higgs doublets @xmath14 , @xmath15 and the messenger / sequestered sector exist apart from supersymmetric gauge interactions ; then no mssm - like @xmath0 or @xmath9 terms are generated after integrating out the messenger / sequestered sector; the gauge singlet superfield @xmath10 has yukawa interactions with the messenger / sequestered sector",
    ". as a result , various soft terms and @xmath10-dependent terms in the superpotential can be generated after integrating out the messenger / sequestered sector .    under the only assumption that the original source of supersymmetry breaking is @xmath6 and that the messengers have a mass of the order @xmath16 , superspace power counting rules allow to estimate the maximally possible order of magnitude of the generated masses and couplings .    in general",
    ", these masses and couplings will comprise nearly all possibilities consistent with gauge invariance ( see section 2 ) , leading to the general nmssm . however , many of these mass terms and couplings can be much smaller , or absent , than indicated by the power counting rules ( but never larger ) , if the corresponding diagrams involve high loop orders , small yukawa couplings , or are forbidden by discrete or ( approximate ) continuous symmetries .    in the next section , we will parametrize the mass terms and couplings of the general nmssm , and estimate their ( maximally possible ) radiatively generated order of magnitude with the help of superspace power counting rules .",
    "section 3 is devoted to a phenomenological analysis of three different scenarios , which are defined by particular boundary conditions for the nmssm parameters at the messenger scale , and section 4 contains our conclusions .",

    "the remaining sparticle spectrum is essentially specified by @xmath8 and @xmath107 , and hardly sensitive to @xmath76 and @xmath62 within the above intervals : & & ~105   + & & ~200   + & & ~670 - 1000   + & & ~900 - 1800   + & & ~140 - 290   + & & ~640 - 890   + & & ~660  ( due to the small value of @xmath76 in this scenario , the supersymmetric contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment is actually too small to account for the presently observed deviation w.r.t . the standard model . )    in fig . 5",
    ", we give the values of @xmath79 ( at the scale @xmath8 ) , which are obtained as an output as function of @xmath76 . within the model corresponding to ( [ 3.1 ] )  ( [ 3.3 ] ) above , one can easily deduce the yukawa coupling @xmath102 from @xmath79 using ( [ 3.3 ] ) resulting in @xmath102 varying in the range @xmath134 ( for @xmath135 ) to @xmath136 ( for @xmath137 ) .",
    "the corresponding value of @xmath138 can then be deduced from ( [ 3.2 ] ) , with the conclusion that @xmath138 should assume values in the range 1 to 4  a reasonable result , by no means guaranteed , that we consider as a strong argument in favour of such a simple model .",
    "finally we note that for larger values of @xmath89 ( as @xmath139 ) , @xmath8 ( as @xmath140 ) and @xmath81 ( as @xmath141 gev@xmath66 , see also the next subsection ) phenomenologically viable regions in parameter space exist where the running yukawa couplings @xmath62 , @xmath77 and @xmath119 remain perturbative up to @xmath121 . within the model above , these scenarios would require an even smaller yukawa coupling @xmath102 , @xmath142 .",
    "scenarios without tadpole terms have been proposed in @xcite . if the number of messengers is doubled ( @xmath143 ) , i.e. introducing @xmath144 , @xmath145 , @xmath146 and @xmath145 , these can couple to @xmath10 and to the spurion @xmath4 in such a way that a discrete @xmath147 symmetry is left unbroken by the vev of @xmath4 @xcite : [ 3.5 ] = ( _ 1 _ 1 + _ 2 _ 2 ) + _",
    "1_2    then tadpole terms @xmath148 and @xmath149 are disallowed , and the yukawa coupling @xmath102 can be much larger .",
    "these scenarios have been recently investigated in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , where the @xmath94 breaking ( generated via the rg equations between @xmath121 and @xmath8 ) inside @xmath150 has been taken into account .    for larger values of @xmath102 ,",
    "messenger loops generate non - negligible values for the singlet mass @xmath78 ( [ 2.18 ] ) , trilinear @xmath2-terms ( [ 2.19 ] ) and corrections @xmath151 as in ( [ 2.24 ] ) at the scale @xmath8 @xcite .",

    "the stop masses are quite large ( up to @xmath115  tev ) such that the stop / top induced radiative corrections to @xmath109 lift it above the lep bound of @xmath110  gev .",
    "we have re - investigated this scenario in a somewhat simpler setup : first we observe that the generated values for @xmath154 and @xmath63 , in the notation ( [ 2.19 ] ) and ( [ 2.24 ] ) , are always related by [ 3.6 ] a_= - _",

    "the singlet mass at the scale @xmath8 is then of the order [ 3.7 ] m_s^2 ( _ h^2 - ( 16 g_3 ^ 2 + 6g_2 ^ 2 + g_1 ^ 2 ) _ h -4 ^ 2 _ h ) m_susy^2  , where we have neglected the @xmath94 breaking among the yukawas at the scale @xmath8 .",
    "we tried to reproduce the three phenomenologically viable regions in parameter space studied in @xcite : region i where @xmath158 , region iii where @xmath159 , and region ii where @xmath160 .",
    "we observe , however , that for @xmath161 ( or @xmath162 after taking the running of @xmath163 between @xmath121 and @xmath8 into account ) the generated value for @xmath164 from ( [ 3.6 ] ) exceeds @xmath165 tev at @xmath8 ( still @xmath166 tev at the weak scale ) , which we interpret as a certain amount of fine tuning between the remaining parameters of the higgs potential .",
    "we will not consider the region ii below .",
    "note that , as in @xcite , we obtain @xmath77 as an output ( from the minimization equations of the higgs potential with @xmath75 as input ) , which can hide the fine tuning required .    limiting ourselves to @xmath167 ( @xmath168 tev ) ,",
    "we were able to confirm the region  i. in table  1 we show the higgs spectrum , and in table  2 the essential features of the corresponding sparticle spectrum for a representative point p1 in region  i , where @xmath169  gev , @xmath170 , @xmath171 and @xmath172 ( leading to @xmath173  gev@xmath66 in agreement with ( [ 3.7 ] ) ) .",
    "the point p2 in tables  1 and 2 is in the region iii of @xcite : there one has @xmath174  tev , @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 ( @xmath178  gev@xmath66 ) .",
    "we see that , in spite of stop masses in the 2 tev region , @xmath109 is not far above the lep bound . on the other hand",
