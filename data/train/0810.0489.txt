    "the low - mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) sax j1808.4 - 3658 ( hereafter j1808 ) is the first detected accretion - powered millisecond pulsar @xcite .",
    "such objects are thought to be evolutionary intermediaries between lmxbs and radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) : they are still in an lmxb phase with ongoing mass transfer but have had time for mass transfer to spin up the accreting neutron star ( ns ) to millisecond spin periods . if and when accretion halts in these systems , they are expected to turn - on as radio msps @xcite . since j1808 s discovery , seven more accretion - powered millisecond pulsars have been discovered , but j1808 stands out as the best observed member of this class .",
    "j1808 has offered us more than several surprises .",
    "its ns s mass function @xcite implies that the donor companion ( which is almost certainly a low - mass brown dwarf * ? ? ?",
    "* ) has a mass @xmath6 ( assuming a fiducial ns mass of 1.4 @xmath7 ) , too large to be explained by standard binary evolution scenarios ( see , e.g. , figure 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "the system s orbital period , @xmath8 , appears to be evolving an order of magnitude faster than binary theory predicts ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* although , see their discussion of possible explanations for this ) .",
    "x - ray observations of the system during its quiescent phases are only able to place upper limits on the ns s thermal component , indicating the ns cools extremely rapidly as compared to most other nss ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "perhaps most surprisingly , observations indirectly suggest j1808 transitions between the lmxb and radio msp state during x - ray quiescent phases @xcite .",
    "the disk in j1808 is thermally unstable and undergoes outbursts lasting approximately a month roughly every 2 years . during the inter - outburst quiescent phase",
    "( when the disk is cooler and dim and may not extend inward close to the ns ) , the system exhibits roughly sinusoidal variability in the optical with the same 2 hr @xmath8 detected in x - rays @xcite .",
    "the phasing of optical maxima corresponds to when the donor is directly behind the ns @xcite , indicating that the donor s face is heated by flux originating near the ns .",
    "typically this flux would be due to the x - ray radiation produced by the accretion flow through the inner accretion disk and onto the ns surface .",
    "however , the amplitude of the optical modulation requires significantly greater x - ray flux than is observed during quiescence ( albeit the x - ray observations are non - simultaneous with the optical ) .",
    "this led to speculation that the ns commences radio pulsar activity during quiescence @xcite , providing the necessary amount of flux to heat the donor s day - side face .    to investigate j1808 in both optical and x - ray wavelengths nearly simultaneously , we have obtained imaging optical data ( @xmath0 and @xmath1 ) from the gemini observatory separated by 6.5 hours from an xmm observation of sax j1808 in quiescence in 2007 .",
    "our science goals for these observations included further constraints on the thermal component of the x - ray emission and its x - ray variability in quiescence , simultaneous determination of the optical modulation to constrain definitively its origin , and determining if optical data allows constraints on either the quiescent disk s structure or on the binary s parameters .",
    "the x - ray observations are described in detail in a companion paper @xcite . here",
    "we discuss the gemini observations . in ",
    "[ s : obs ] we describe the observations and data reduction . in  [ s : lc_analysis ] , we describe the light curve analysis within the framework of a theoretical model .",

    "the appendix includes details on how our data and further system details ( in particular j1808 s distance ) constrain our model s parameters .",
    "we observed 1808 on march 8 and march 10 , 2007 with the gemini multi - object spectrograph - south ( gmos - s ; * ? ? ? * ) in imaging mode . the march 10 observation ( program gs-2007a - q-8 , ut 06:47 to 09:55 ) was nearly simultaneous with the xmm - newton observation ( obsid 0400230501 ) , which started at 16:24 ut , and continued for 16 hours without evidence for strong variability .",
    "we took a time series of 44 @xmath0 exposures of 185 s each , with two 230 s @xmath1 exposures at either end to obtain colour information .",
    "atmospheric seeing was generally good , ranging from 0.65  to 0.98  fwhm .",
    "landolt standard star fields pg1047 + 003 and sa104 were also observed during the same night .",
    "the march 8 observation , using an identical program , suffered from poorer seeing ( fwhm ranging from 1.0 to 1.4 ) , but still provided data adequate for our purposes , and thus we analyse it as well .",
    "we used the calibrated gemini data products , which are processed with gemini - specific iraf tasks to remove the bias , and flat - field and mosaic the images .",
    "we performed photometry on @xmath0 and @xmath1 reference frames using daophot @xcite point - spread - function ( psf ) fitting photometry , calibrated using the standard star fields .",
    "comparison of our images with the finding chart of @xcite reveals two stars , separated by 0.5 , that are consistent with j1808 s indicated location ( see figure [ fig : fchart ] ) .",
    "the brighter of these two is variable on a 2-hour period , and we confidently identify it with j1808 . by associating ten uncrowded unsaturated nearby stars with stars in the usno b1.0 catalogue @xcite , we find a position of @xmath9=18:08:27.63 , @xmath10=-36:58:43.37 ( j2000 ) , with uncertainties of 0.2  in each coordinate ( accounting for the uncertainty in the transformation to the usno b1.0 frame ) .",
    "this is consistent with the vla - derived position of @xcite , and with the optical position recently derived by @xcite .",

    "comm . ) , and may affect psf - fitting or aperture photometry of j1808 in quiescence taken in poor seeing .",
    "we then used the differential photometry program isis @xcite for each filter , following the basic method of @xcite as follows .",
    "we select the best - seeing reference frame for each filter , and transform the remaining frames onto the reference coordinate systems , aligning the frames with bright stars .",
    "we produced a reference frame from the seven best - seeing @xmath0 frames .",
    "this frame is convolved with a spatially varying ( 3 degrees of freedom ) kernel to match each frame s psf , and subtracted from the remaining frames",
    ". only variable stars ( and stars which are saturated ) should remain on the subtracted images , as stars of constant brightness cancel out .",
    "finally , profile photometry is extracted from the subtracted images , barycenter corrected to tdb using the perl extension astro::time::hjd to correct the observation times to heliocentric julian dates .",

    "the fit shown is to a sinusoid with orbital period fixed to the value of 7249.1569 s @xcite.,title=\"fig:\",width=317 ]",
    "the observed optical light curves show significant variability on time scales of order the orbital period as well as flickering on time scales shorter than @xmath8 . having only obtained four @xmath1 values during each night s observations precludes averaging the @xmath1 data between nights ; the intrinsic variability of the source further precludes a simple combination of @xmath1 data into a single light curve .",
    "we proceed by analysing each night s light curves separately .",
    "later we ll consider what constraints on j1808 s system parameters can be derived by considering the two nights data in tandem .    in order to compare against our model light curves",
    ", we sorted our data by orbital phase , @xmath12 using the orbital ephemeris of @xcite .",
    "the march 10 @xmath0 data exhibits a clear , systematic brightening beyond the second observed minimum ( i.e. , past @xmath13 hrs in figure [ fig : glightcurve ] ) , as well as large amplitude flickering .",
    "this aperiodic variability is likely due to stochastic processes in the disk ( e.g , hot - spot variability ) that are not captured by our models described below .",
    "we do not have a sufficient number of observations to average over the stochastic variability .",
    "so , in order to compare our models with a observational time - frame representing as much as possible almost constant conditions in the system , we excluded from our analysis the march 10 @xmath0-data beyond the second flux minima .",
    "this keeps the @xmath0 points obtained during the same orbit as the march 10 @xmath1 data .",
    "the remaining @xmath0 data we phase sorted , binned ( using a bin width @xmath14 ) , and then averaged by bin to reduce the flickering s impact on the fits . the data resulting from all these procedures , and used in our model light curve fitting below , are shown in figure [ fig : lc_procdata ] .",
    "we utilize the program elc @xcite to calculate theoretical model light curves . to model the optical data , we consider contributions from both an accretion disk and a donor that is irradiated by an energy flux originating at the location of the accreting ns .",
    "the elc program includes the effects of limb darkening ( implicitly via use of phoenix model atmospheres ) and disk / donor occultations .",
    "our model has seven independent input parameters .",
    "the first two are the masses of the accreting ns , @xmath15 , and the donor , @xmath16 .",
    "once @xmath15 , @xmath16 are specified , the binary s inclination relative to our line of sight , @xmath17 is determined via the ns s mass function @xcite .",
    "we determine the binary s orbital separation from @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath8 . from @xmath8 and",
    "the requirement that the donor fills its roche lobe , the donor s radius , @xmath18 , is determined once @xmath16 is specified .",
    "this also fixes the donor s unirradiated effective temperature , @xmath19 , which we obtain from unpublished low - mass brown dwarf models of deloye & taam ( the @xmath19 obtained from these models are very similar to those of , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the resulting @xmath19 , which are a function of @xmath16 alone , range between @xmath20@xmath21 k.    to account for the periodic variability , the donor s optical contribution must be phase dependent .",
    "the elc program allows modelling this source of variability by irradiating the donor with a point source of flux at the accretor s location .",
    "we consider the impact of such a point source with total luminosity , @xmath22 , between @xmath23 and @xmath24 erg s@xmath25 .",
    "we fix the donor s albedo in elc to the value minimizing the required @xmath22 for a given light curve amplitude .",
    "if the donor s albedo differ from this , a commensurate increase in @xmath22 will be required to produce the same results .",
    "to model the disk in j1808 , we use four parameters : the disk s inner and outer radii , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , the temperature of the disk at @xmath26 , @xmath28 , and an exponent , @xmath29 , that characterizes the disk s radial temperature profile , @xmath30 .",
    "the structure of a quiescent accretion disk , in particular is not expected to be that of the standard steady - state disk model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this expectation has been verified by observations of other binaries in quiescence , which find , in particular , @xmath29-values ranging from @xmath31 to @xmath32 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* steady - state disks are expected to have @xmath33 ) . given this expectation ,",
    "we treat each of these four parameters as independent quantities .",
    "the values of @xmath22 used here are substantially greater than the @xmath34 ergs s@xmath25 observed from 1808 in quiescence @xcite .",
    "as seen below , such high values of @xmath22 are required to fit our data , making it clear that the x - ray emission in the system insufficient to drive the observed optical variability . as has already been suggested @xcite",
    ", the ns itself could provide the required irradiating flux in the form of a pulsar - wind that turns - on during the quiescent phase of the disk outburst cycle .",
    "however , we will refrain from detailed attempts to interpret the source or quality of the required irradiating energy",
    ". instead , we view our results as a guide to the amount of flux required to impinge on the donor in order to produce the observed amplitude of variability .",
    "we will make a few further comments on this point in the discussion .",
    "we also attempted to fit the optical data using an irradiated - donor only model . for this case , instead of fixing the donor s unirradiated @xmath19 at the values predicted by brown dwarf evolution models , we allowed @xmath19 to be a free parameter ranging between @xmath35 and @xmath36 k ( chosen to provide sufficient @xmath0 flux at light curve minimum given j1808 s distance as discussed below ) .",
    "this provided an input parameter set of @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath19 , and @xmath22 .",
    "this model was motivated by the possibility that horizontal fluid currents in the donor s atmosphere may efficiently advect the irradiating energy to the donor s night side , elevating the surface temperature there ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , this model can not simultaneously reproduce the light curves morphology , amplitude , and @xmath37 colours , and did not produce acceptable fits .",
    "we used elc to calculate model light curves at discrete values of six of our input parameters : @xmath38 1.4 , 1.6 , 1.8 , ... , 3.0 @xmath7 ; @xmath39 0.05 , 0.06 , 0.07 , ... , 0.13 @xmath7 ; @xmath40 0.001 , 0.01 , 0.03 , 0.06 , 0.1 , and 0.2 @xmath41 ( where @xmath41 is the roche lobe radius of the accretor and is the internal unit used by elc ) ; @xmath42 0.25 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.6 , 0.7 , 0.8 , and 0.9 @xmath41 ; @xmath43 5000 , 5500 , 6000 , ... , 10000 k ; and @xmath44 0.0 , -0.1 , -0.2 , -0.3 , -0.5 , and -0.75 .    for each set of input parameters , @xmath45 , @xmath16 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath46 , and each night s data , we first minimized the @xmath47 contribution of the @xmath0 data , @xmath48 , against @xmath22 .",
    "we did not calculate the @xmath1 data s contribution to @xmath47 , @xmath49 , simultaneously with the @xmath48-determination because elc ignores colour information during simultaneous fits .",
    "thus , once we determined the @xmath22 that minimized @xmath48 , we calculated the corresponding @xmath1 light curve and calculated @xmath49 retaining the @xmath37 information .",
    "we finally calculated @xmath50 .",
    "we found that to obtain `` acceptable '' fits ( that is , a reduced @xmath51 ) , we needed to systematically increase the data s error bars by 0.0164 and 0.0129 mags for the march 08 and march 10 data , respectively .",
    "both of these values are typically less than the 1@xmath52 errors shown in figures [ fig : glightcurve ] .",
    "the error bars shown in figure [ fig : lc_procdata ] reflect this increase .    to validate that our spacing of the input parameters is fine enough to effectively probe the @xmath47 hyper - surface , we performed additional fits using several test grids of input parameters with spacings at least twice as fine as above .",
    "the best fits obtained in these test calculations were no better than on our standard grid .",
    "the elc code does not model contributions from the hot spot where the accretion stream impacts the disk .",
    "we argue here that the hot spot s potential contribution can not explain the observed light curves .",
    "however , it may contribute to the disk s overall flux at an important level ; if this were the case , then the disk parameters we derive from our fits would be suspect . given that we are unable to meaningfully constrain the parameters of our disk model , as discussed in ",
    "[ s : parconst ] , this shortcoming does not impact our central results .",
    "the main argument against a modulation of the hot spot s contribution explaining the observed light curve is the orbital phase of flux maximum .",
    "we can compare the time of the ascending node phase , @xmath53 , from rxte timing with our gemini optical data . if the sinusoidal modulation represents the heated companion  with light maximum corresponding to donor s superior conjunction  then the @xmath53 from the gemini data is ( tdb ) mjd=54169.2784(3 ) .",
    "we can compare this with the predicted @xmath53 advanced from the combined orbital solution of @xcite , which is ( tdb ) mjd=54169.280(6 ) , with which it is consistent . using the more recent ephemeris of @xcite",
    "gives a predicted @xmath53 of ( tdb ) mjd=54169.28000(3 ) , differing from our @xmath53 by 138@xmath1147 seconds , or @xmath54% of the orbital period .",
    "either ephemeris confirms that light maximum occurs when the donor is behind the ns .",
    "@xcite , which is ( tdb ) mjd=54169.28000(3 ) .",
    "these times differ by @xmath55 seconds , or @xmath56% of the orbital period , confirming light maximum occurs when the donor is behind the ns .",
    "on the other hand , the hot spot maximum should lead the donor s inferior conjunction by some degree . extrapolating the calculations of @xcite or @xcite to the expected mass ratio range of j1808",
    "predicts that , for a disk extending only out to the stream s circularization radius , the hot spot maximum should lead the inferior conjunction by a phase of 0.10.13 .",
    "i.e. , at a phase 0.370.40 later than the observed maximum .",
    "the circularization radius represents the minimum distance the hot spot can be located from the ns .",
    "the disk likely extends beyond this radius , leading to a hot spot location that leads the donor s inferior conjunction by an even smaller margin .",
    "this strongly supports the origin of the modulation as due to the heated secondary , rather than the hot spot .        before estimating input parameter values from the above @xmath47 calculations , we utilized j1808 s distance estimates to only consider theoretical models whose @xmath0-band fluxes fall within appropriate ranges .",
    "@xcite constrained j1808 s distance , @xmath57 , using several different methods .",
    "they modelled the type i x - ray bursts that occurred during the 2002 october outbursts , comparing x - ray burst recurrence times , bolometric fluence , and the ratios of integrated persistent flux to burst fluence . from their best fitting burst models",
    ", they estimate that @xmath58@xmath59 kpc . the observed x - ray bursts all showed evidence for radius expansion ; for a pure helium ns atmosphere ( i.e. , consistent with the x - ray bursts being he triggered events , * ?",
    "* ) , this constrains @xmath60 kpc ( this estimate decreases if there is any h present in the atmosphere ) .",
    "finally , based on the fluences and recurrence times of the system s long - term outbursts , @xcite estimate a lower limit of @xmath61 kpc by assuming the _ minimum _ time - averaged mass transfer rate onto the ns is set by the binary s gravity - wave driven @xmath62 in the conservative limit .",
    "based on these estimates , we take as a fiducial constraint @xmath63 kpc @xmath11 a @xmath64% uncertainty ( i.e. , the @xmath65@xmath66 kpc of * ? ? ?",
    "for comparison , we also carried out our analysis assuming an uncertainty of @xmath67% on @xmath57 .",
    "we then used these @xmath57 estimates to convert the observed @xmath0-values at light curve minima into a @xmath0-band luminosity at @xmath68 , @xmath69 .",
    "for this we took @xmath70 based on @xmath71 @xmath72 @xcite ; the corresponding @xmath73 .",
    "the resulting @xmath69 ranges for the 3% ( 10% ) uncertainties on @xmath57 are @xmath74 and @xmath75 erg s@xmath25 for the march 08 and march 10 data , respectively .",
    "there are several general trends in how the input parameters influence the fits .",
    "first , the disk parameters ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) are all completely unconstrained by the observations .",
    "since each of these parameters can influence overall disk brightness and colour , the fact they are not individually constrained is not too surprising .",
    "second , @xmath48 is mainly a function of @xmath17 .",
    "the @xmath0-data on its own ( see discussion below ) rules out @xmath76 at the 3-@xmath52 level ( i.e. , @xmath77 for one free parameter ) .",
    "third , the best - fitting @xmath22 increases with @xmath69 and , in general , @xmath78 ergs s@xmath25 is required to produce acceptable fits .",
    "the @xmath69 limits indirectly constrain both @xmath17 and @xmath15 . the relative contribution of the disk vs.  the donor  which impacts @xmath47 primarily through a model s @xmath1-band amplitude  impacts both @xmath69 and @xmath15 .",
    "larger @xmath69-values have larger ( phase independent ) disk contributions , resulting in a lower @xmath1-band amplitude .",
    "larger @xmath15-values have ( for a given @xmath17 ) larger and hotter donors , which tend to increase @xmath1-band amplitudes .",
    "these two effects in combination lead to minimum @xmath47-values at increasing @xmath69 as the @xmath15-value is increased . within the @xmath69-range derived from the distance constraints , the minimum @xmath47-values generally decrease with increasing @xmath15 while the minima-@xmath47 at fixed @xmath15 are increasing functions of @xmath69 ( see upper panel of fig . [",
    "fig : deli_lgp ] ) .",
    "thus the lower @xmath69-limit indirectly favours more massive nss . on the other hand ,",
    "the high-@xmath69 limit indirectly disfavours lower values of @xmath17 since models with brighter @xmath69 in general require larger @xmath16 .",
    "taking our fiducial @xmath57 constraint , we are able to produce acceptable fits to each night s data : the best - fit to the march 08 data had a @xmath79 for 37 degrees of freedom ( d.o.f ) , while the best - fit to the march 10 data had a @xmath80 ( for 17 d.o.f . ) . taken individually ,",
    "each night s observations place constraints on @xmath17 and @xmath22 at the 2@xmath52 level .",
    "both nights require @xmath81 at a 2@xmath52 confidence . for march 08 , @xmath82@xmath83 erg s@xmath25 , while the march 10 limits @xmath84@xmath85 erg s@xmath25 . the march 08 @xmath1 data ,",
    "since it includes points near both light curve maximum and minimum , constrains our models more strongly then the march 10 data . because of this , the march 08 observation , on its own , provides limits on j1808 s component masses , requiring @xmath86 and @xmath87 ( where these limits are on the two parameters _ individually _ ) .",
    "the preference for larger @xmath15 results from the need to achieve the observed @xmath1-band amplitude given the lower limit on @xmath69 required by the @xmath57-estimates ( see discussion in  [ sec : gentrendsparlimits ] ) .",
    "while the march 10 data set does not by itself provide strong constraints on j1808 s binary parameters , fits to it do still favour larger @xmath15 values .",
    "thus we also considered both nights observations in tandem in order to determine if more stringent constraints on @xmath15 and @xmath16 could be developed .",
    "to do so , for each pair of ( @xmath15,@xmath16)-values , we considered all input - parameter sets @xmath88 ( producing a fit with @xmath89 against march 08 data ) and @xmath90 ( producing a fit with @xmath91 against the march 10 data ) sharing the specified ( @xmath15,@xmath16)-values .",
    "as the source distance is treated as a free parameter by elc when determining @xmath47 , we needed to be careful to only consider ( @xmath88 , @xmath90)-pairs whose resulting best - fit distance estimates , @xmath92 , were mutually consistent between the two nights .",
    "we considered a ( @xmath88 , @xmath90 ) to have mutually consistent @xmath92 if @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the maximum change in model distance producing a @xmath95 in a fit s quality .",
    "we determined @xmath94 by averaging over the required change in @xmath92 for @xmath96 of our best - fitting models between both nights .",

    "the greyscale values indicate the uncertainty levels associated with this @xmath99 for a single independent parameter ( i.e. , one and two @xmath52 corresponds to a @xmath100 and @xmath101 , etc . ) ; thus various regions provide limits on @xmath15 and @xmath16 taken independently .",
    "the solid white and black lines provide approximate contours of the 2@xmath52 and 3@xmath52 levels to guide the eye . for this plot",

    "if our observations had not resolved this star , we would have found @xmath0-band semi - amplitudes of @xmath118 , consistent with the @xcite analysis of the @xmath112-band data of @xcite .",

    "our 2@xmath52 @xmath17 limits ( 36 - 67@xmath2 ) are consistent with these results .      since our observations were able to resolve the faint interloping star nearby j1808 , it is not surprising that we need a larger @xmath22 to explain the larger optical modulation amplitudes we find .",
    "quantitatively , in our good fitting models @xmath22 is greater by a factor of @xmath121 relative to that found by @xcite . as with these prior observations ,",
    "our required @xmath22 is 1 - 2 orders of magnitude greater than the observed quiescent x - ray luminosity @xmath122 erg s@xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we also checked whether the amount of flux required to irradiate the donor could be provided by the remnant disk in the system and found that the donor is only able to reprocess @xmath123% of the disk s luminosity .",
    "thus , this scenario falls 1 - 2 orders of magnitude short of being able to explain the modulation amplitudes .",
    "we conclude that the only source that plausibly can power the optical modulation is the spin - down energy of the central ns . as suggested by @xcite , this energy is likely tapped through a pulsar - wind that turns - on during quiescence ( when the mass - transfer rate onto the ns is reduced enough to allow the accretion disk to be truncated outside of the ns s light - cylinder ) .",
    "the luminosity provided by the ns s spin - down is @xmath124 , where @xmath114 is the ns s moment of inertia and @xmath125 is its spin - frequency . @xcite",
    "have recently measured j1808 s long - term @xmath126 hz s@xmath25 .",
    "thus , the requirement @xmath127 allows lower limits to be placed on @xmath114 . to proceed along these lines , we determined lower limits on @xmath22 as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "these limits are derived from the march 08 data due to its larger @xmath0-amplitude by taking the minimum march 08 @xmath22 within the set of all ( @xmath88 , @xmath90 ) with specified @xmath15 and a @xmath98 within 3-@xmath52 of the minimum .    for our fiducial 3% @xmath57-uncertainties , this minimum @xmath128 erg s@xmath25 , almost independent of @xmath15 . with @xmath129 hz and @xmath130 hz s@xmath25 ,",
    "this leads to @xmath131 g @xmath132 ( with the quoted error on @xmath114 only including the @xmath133 uncertainty contribution ) .",
    "the central value of this @xmath114 limit is certainly consistent with our finding that j1808 harbours a more massive ns and , for a range of nuclear equations of state , would require @xmath134 ( see figure 4 of * ? ? ?",
    "however , the large @xmath133 uncertainty prevents our @xmath22 limits from excluding much of the @xmath114-@xmath15 parameter space and even @xmath135 are consistent with the lower end of the allowed @xmath114-range .",
    "we note in passing that if the efficiency at which the pulsar s particle wind energy is thermalized in the donor s atmosphere were 50% , then the lower limit on @xmath114 , including the @xmath133 uncertainty , would rule out @xmath136 at least for the range of equations of state considered in @xcite .",
    "our @xmath15 estimates can also be connected with the ns cooling rate observed in j1808 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "observations indicate that nss exhibit a range of cooling rates across both the isolated and accreting sub - populations that are set by the specific neutrino emission processes occurring in the ns core ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "generally speaking , the most efficient neutrino production process available to lower mass nss is the modified urca process , which results in a `` standard '' cooling rate ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . at the higher core densities found in higher mass nss , several direct urca processes  depending on the constituent nature of matter at high density ( i.e. , nucleons , hyperons , or `` free '' quarks)are allowed that provide orders of magnitude faster cooling @xcite than the standard rate .",
    "the ns mass at which the transition from standard to enhanced cooling occurs and how broad the range of masses over which it occurs depends on the equation of state of matter at supra - nuclear densities and other physics ( such as the occurrence of transitions to various superfluid states and in - medium modifications to the neutrino emission processes * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) . most young isolated",
    "nss appear to cool at rates close to the standard one . on the assumption that most of the nss in the observed cooling sample have masses consistent with other ns populations",
    ", we can infer that those nss cooling near the standard rate have masses @xmath137 @xcite . within the isolated ns population",
    "there are several clear cases ( the vela pulsar and psr j0205 + 64 ) of objects with cooling rates intermediate between the standard and the fully - developed enhanced rates .",
    "effective modelling of all the isolated systems strongly indicates that the transition to enhanced cooling has to occur over some mass range and these intermediate cooling - rate systems have masses in this transition interval @xcite .    amongst the set of accreting ns systems",
    ", there is a similar spread in observed cooling rates .",
    "again , most systems cool at rates consistent with or slightly faster than the standard rate",
    ". however , j1808 is one of two systems hosting an accreting ns whose cooling rate is consistent with the fully - developed enhanced rate .",
    "our constraints limiting @xmath138 are consistent with the picture of high - mass nss accessing the enhanced cooling mode .",
    "we will postpone a detailed analysis of how j1808 s ns cooling rate combined with @xmath15 estimates can constrain matter s equation of state at supra - nuclear densities for a future paper .",
    "we should note that recently @xcite have provided estimates for @xmath15 in j1808 based on modelling the pulsed x - ray light curve observed during its 1998 outburst . across a set of various models , they find best - fitting @xmath15 values @xmath139 .",
    "such low @xmath15 values are inconsistent with j1808 s enhanced cooling rate given the propensity of data supporting `` normal '' ns masses @xmath137 ( see above ) .",
    "the 3@xmath52 contours quoted for some of the @xcite models do include @xmath15 values up to @xmath140 , which could be consistent with j1808 s rapid cooling . at this same confidence level , our fiducial @xmath15 estimates are barely consistent with those of @xcite .      given its ns mass function , @xmath8 , and presence of hydrogen @xcite , j1808 is most likely the descendent of a ns - low mass ms binary whose evolution paralleled that of the related wd accreting cataclysmic variables ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the initial evolution of j1808 s lmxb phase was towards shorter @xmath8 as its then main - sequence ( ms ) companion was able to maintain thermal equilibrium and contract under mass loss . as @xmath16 decreased , its kelvin - helmholtz time increased , eventually becoming longer than its mass - loss time and the donor began to expand under mass loss , driving the binary to longer @xmath8 .",
    "standard evolutionary models find that the resulting @xmath8 minimum should occur near 70 minutes ( while the observed value is closer to 80 minutes * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at which point @xmath141 @xcite .",
    "by the time systems have evolved back out to @xmath142 hr , @xmath143 @xcite . as already noted by @xcite ,",
    "the minimum @xmath16 allowed by the ns s mass function ( @xmath144 for @xmath145 ) is greater than this expected @xmath16-value .",
    "our 2@xmath52 limit on the donor s mass , @xmath87 , provides independent evidence for @xmath16 values significantly higher than standard theory predicts for j1808 .    at j1808",
    "s @xmath8 , if the donor truly has @xmath87 , it would have to have a greater entropy content than the @xmath146 donors at minimum @xmath147 minutes .",
    "this possible discrepancy could be explained in at least two ways : ( a ) j1808 s minimum @xmath8 was larger than predicted and the ms companion at this point still had sufficient entropy to account for the donor s current state ; and/or ( b ) the donor has been heated during the system s post @xmath8-minimum evolution .",
    "the former could occur if either the donor s kh time was longer than expected ( e.g. , due to strong external irradiation from the accretion flow ) or its mass - loss time was shorter than expected .",
    "this could be achieved via an additional angular momentum sink besides gravity - wave radiation losses or to non - conservative mass - transfer effects .",
    "certain models for tidal heating of the donor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) could provide a mechanism for heating the donor during the post @xmath8-minimum evolution .",
    "we plan to perform detailed modelling of j1808 s prior binary evolution to quantify which of these effects can plausibly explain the system s current state .",
    "we undertook optical observations of sax j1808 in quiescence in @xmath0 and @xmath1 with gemini south that were taken nearly coincident with xmm - newton x - ray observations .",
    "the observations were taken on two separate nights with coverage of slightly more than one of j1808 s @xmath148 hr orbits each night .",
    "we detected optical modulations in both night s data on the system s @xmath8 in both bands .",
    "our observations resolved a nearby interloping star that was unresolved in the observations used in prior light curve analyses @xcite .",
    "the optical modulations in our data have a larger amplitude than those measured in these prior efforts , and this amplitude difference is consistent with prior observations being contaminated by the nearby faint star .",
    "our data also exhibits significant inter - orbit variability .",
    "we modelled the @xmath0 and @xmath1 light curves obtained using the light curve modelling program elc .",
    "our model s free parameters were the ns and donor masses ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , parameters describing the disk ( @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 ) , and the luminosity irradiating the donor , @xmath22 , that powers the optical modulation .",
    "the binary inclination , @xmath17 , and orbital separation are then determined from the measured ns mass function and system @xmath8 . to fit our data , we constructed a grid over ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath28 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath29 ) and for each vertex of this grid , optimized @xmath22 , performing the most extensive modelling of j1808 s optical behaviour to date .",
    "we derived estimates for our input parameters from the subset of our models whose @xmath0 luminosity was consistent with the optical data given j1808 s distance , @xmath57 , constraints . at the 2@xmath52 confidence level , we constrain @xmath17 = 3667@xmath2 .",
    "we also constrain @xmath15 and @xmath16 , but these limits are sensitive to the uncertainties in @xmath57 ( see the appendix ) . for our fiducial 3% @xmath57-uncertainty @xcite ,",
    "we constrain @xmath149 and @xmath106 . for a 10% d - uncertainty",
    ", these limits expand to @xmath150 and @xmath109 .",

    "the almost coincident x - ray observation determined the x - ray luminosity of the source at this epoch to be @xmath152 erg s@xmath25 @xcite , far below that required to power the optical variability .",
    "however , the measured ns spin - down rate @xcite can reasonably provide the required @xmath22 .",
    "as suggested previously @xcite , this could indicate that radio pulsar activity switches on in j1808 during its quiescent periods and the resulting pulsar particle wind provides the necessary flux to illuminate the donor s day - time side .",
    "if the donor is less than 100% efficient in converting this particle flux to thermal radiation , then the required @xmath22 increases above our quoted range .",
    "an efficiency of 50% would require a sufficiently large ns moment of inertia that @xmath136 would be ruled out for many reasonable nuclear equations of state .",
    "our estimates of @xmath108 are consistent with j1808 s very low thermal x - ray luminosity @xcite .",
    "such massive nss are expected to cool rapidly due to direct urca neutrino emission processes that can not occur in lower mass nss .",
    "our estimates that @xmath87 also provide independent support ( in addition to the ns s mass function ) that the donor in this system has a significantly higher entropy than expected from standard binary evolution models .",
    "this would indicate that any of several processes that could increase the system s minimum @xmath8 or heat the donor have been operative in the system .",

    "the fact that the best - fitting models with larger @xmath15 agree in @xmath1 amplitude with the data at larger @xmath69 values is the ultimate reason why the @xmath69 limits favour massive @xmath15 .",
