    "low  energy precision measurements , in particular precision determination of the ckm parameters and the branching fractions of rare decays , provide many valuable tests of the standard model .",
    "the resulting constraints on new physics are highly complementary to the direct searches at hadron colliders , and are expected to continue being so throughout the lhc era  @xcite .",
    "the experimental effort over the past few years by the b factories and the tevatron has established the fact that ckm is the main mechanism of flavour and cp violation in the quark sector .",
    "this is now a field of precision physics .",
    "measuring deviations from the standard model and further strengthening the constraints on new physics will require a continuous experimental effort  @xcite alongside corresponding progress on the theory side .",
    "the obvious example of the progress that was made is the precise measurement of the small angle @xmath4 of the unitarity triangle , and its comparison with the short side of the triangle , @xmath5 .",
    "while the former is directly sensitive to potential cp  violation beyond the standard model and can be measured experimentally with high precision without any theoretical input , the latter , being determined by tree ",
    "level weak ( semileptonic ) decays , is insensitive to new physics , however it heavily relies on theoretical calculations in qcd .",
    "currently the measured @xmath6 is not entirely consistent with @xmath5 , introducing some tension into global fits  @xcite .",
    "this comparison is a crucial element in the big picture .",
    "experimentally , both @xmath0 and @xmath7 can be measured either using an exclusive hadronic final state , e.g. @xmath8 and @xmath9 or by considering the inclusive rate , summing over all hadronic final states subject to some kinematical constraints .",
    "the two approaches involve different experimental and theoretical tools and are therefore complementary",
    ".    the lower rate of the @xmath10 transition ( @xmath11 ) makes the @xmath0 measurement more challenging .",
    "further difficulties , common to all heavy  to  light decays , lie on the theory side .",
    "the _ exclusive _ determination of @xmath0 requires a theoretical calculation of the form factor using non - perturbative methods such as lattice qcd  @xcite or qcd sum - rules  @xcite , which both have systematic uncertainties that are hard to quantify .",
    "the lattice calculations are expected to improve in the future .",
    "in contrast the _ inclusive _ determination relies primarily on the heavy quark expansion ( hqe ) and qcd perturbation theory , where a systematic improvement can be achieved and uncertainties are easier to quantify .",
    "however , the case of inclusive @xmath10 decay is further complicated by the fact that the final state is characterized by jet - like kinematics .",
    "this , in conjunction with the experimental requirement to perform the measurement subject to stringent kinematic cuts ( in order to suppress the charm background ) implies that to extract @xmath0 one needs a precise calculation of the spectrum , not just the total width .",
    "this provides one of the biggest challenges in heavy flavour physics , a subject an intense theoretical effort over the past few years .",
    "this is the subject of the present talk .",
    "in order to appreciate the difficulty in determining @xmath0 , it is useful to compare it to the much favored case of @xmath7 . let us therefore briefly review the situation in inclusive semileptonic @xmath12 decays .",
    "owing to the high rate of these decays and their distinct characteristics , the b factories provide precise measurements of the branching fraction , as well as the first few moments , _ over the entire phase space_. these truly  inclusive observables can be readily computed using the hqe , for example , @xmath13 where the first term stands for the partonic on - shell @xmath14-quark decay width @xmath15 , computed with an infrared cutoff @xmath16 , and other terms , suppressed by powers of the b  quark mass correspond to matrix elements of local operators , computed with an ultraviolet cutoff @xmath16 ; as usual , the @xmath16 dependence cancels out order by order .",
    "importantly , non - perturbative corrections first appear at order @xmath17 , where there are two non - perturbative matrix elements , the kinetic energy @xmath18 and the chromomagnetic energy @xmath19 .",
    "note that the partonic decay width computed to next - to - leading order ( order @xmath20 ) , without a cutoff , already yields a viable approximation to the measured width .",
    "this approximation is systematically improved by including non - perturbative corrections as well as higher  order perturbative corrections .",
    "there is a continuous progress on both these fronts .",
    "recent fits to the measured moments  @xcite are based on @xmath21 accuracy @xcite with power corrections through @xmath22 , computed with leading  order coefficient functions .",
    "these fits ( performed in the `` kinetic '' or 1s mass schemes ) provide a determination of @xmath7 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the @xmath25 level together with a determination of @xmath18 at the @xmath26 level .    very recently ,",
    "complete @xmath27 corrections have become available in a fully differential form  @xcite ; @xmath28 corrections have been computed for the first time  @xcite and also the @xmath29 correction to the coefficient function of @xmath18 @xcite was calculated .",
    "these advances will further push the accuracy , exploiting the potential of the b factory measurements for inclusive @xmath12 decays .",
    "experimental measurements  @xcite of inclusive @xmath10 decays involve kinematic cuts in order to remove the charm background .",
    "therefore , extracting @xmath0 from the data requires theoretical predictions for the fully ( triple ) differential @xmath30 spectrum .    the main difficulty in computing the spectra of heavy - to - light decays , @xmath30 or @xmath31 , is in the fact that most events have a jet - like final state where the hadronic system @xmath32 has a mass which is much smaller than its energy ( approximately half of the energy released in the decay , @xmath23 ) . the jet kinematics is most easily described in terms of light - cone momenta @xmath33 , where a typical event has @xmath34 of order @xmath23 and @xmath35 not far above the qcd scale @xmath36",
    "the decay process involves dynamics on scales that are far apart @xmath37 , complicating the perturbative description as well as the separation and parametrization of non - perturbative effects .",
    "it has long been recognized  @xcite that an attempt to compute the spectrum in the small@xmath35 limit by means of the hqe would run into serious difficulties : the dynamics is dominated by gluons with momenta of @xmath38 , turning the @xmath39 expansion into a @xmath40 one !",
    "the physical picture behind this breakdown of the expansion is clear : the small lightcone component of the jet is influenced by soft gluon radiation as well as small fluctuations in the momentum carried by the decaying heavy quark . to recover a useful heavy - quark expansion , the dominant effects , those controlled by the scale @xmath35 ,",
    "must be resummed to all orders .",
    "this sum gives rise to the well - known `` shape function '' , which can be interpreted as the momentum distribution function of the b quark in the b meson .",
    "similar functions appear at higher orders in the heavy ",
    "quark expansion .",
    "recall that in the @xmath12 case one could make use of the hqe : the relevant observables were well approximated by perturbation theory and the non - perturbative corrections were restricted to a few _ local matrix elements_. in contrast , when considering the @xmath10 case one is required to compute the spectrum at small @xmath35 , which is proportional , _ already at leading power _ , to a non - perturbative object , the `` shape function '' .",
    "this function is defined by the _ non - local matrix element _ : @xmath41\\gamma_+ h(0)}\\left|b\\right>\\ , , \\label{sf_def}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is a lightcone momentum component ( @xmath43 are heavy ",
    "quark effective theory fields , and @xmath44 $ ] represents a gauge link ) .",
    "this function describes the distribution of momentum carried by the b quark .",
    "thus , we observe that instead of having a few unknown non - perturbative matrix elements which enter as power  suppressed corrections , one faces here an unknown _ function _ already at the leading order in @xmath39 !    described in these terms the problem of computing the spectrum and extracting @xmath0 from data may appear hopeless , or at least require a full - fledged non - perturbative approach .",
    "in fact , as we shall see below , the actual situation is significantly better .",
    "the partial branching fractions corresponding to experimentally relevant cuts , which vary between 20 to 60 percent of the total , can be still estimated reliably with very little non - perturbative input . moreover , at present , the largest uncertainty in extracting @xmath0 is associated with the parametric dependence on the b - quark mass ; other uncertainties ( e.g. power corrections , weak annihilation ) can be reduced by further exploiting the data and thus the prospects for an even more precise @xmath0 from inclusive decays are high .    in the following",
    "i will briefly describe different theoretical approaches that have been developed in the past few years to compute the fully  differential spectrum and thus extract @xmath0 from the b factories data .",
    "i will not enter into any technical details , just try to give the flavor of the physics involved and the principal differences between the approaches .",
    "i will also not cover all the interesting theoretical developments in this area , notably the method to express the @xmath10 branching fractions directly in terms of the measured photon  energy spectrum in @xmath45 , which had some resurrection recently  @xcite , incorporating subleading effects in @xmath39 .",
    "the central idea of the hqe  based structure  function parametrization approach , which has been recently put forward and implemented by gambino _ et .",
    "@xcite , is to first use the hqe to compute carefully  selected observables  the first few moments of the structure functions  where this expansion is expected to be most reliable , and then use these observables to constrain the parametrization of the spectrum . in this way one bypasses",
    "the need to deal with the difficult kinematic region @xmath37 where neither the hqe nor perturbation theory converge well .",
    "to explain briefly how the calculation in this approach is set up , let us recall that the triple - differential rate can be written in terms on three hadronic structure functions @xmath46 : @xmath47w_2+q^2(2e_l - q_0)w_3\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the total leptonic energy and squared invariant mass , respectively . ref .",
    "@xcite computes the shape of the physical structure functions @xmath46 as a convolution _ at fixed @xmath49 _ between non - perturbative distribution functions @xmath50 and the perturbative ( presently the born - level ) structure functions @xmath51 : @xmath52 where the functions @xmath50 are parametrized and constrained by the first few @xmath48-moments of @xmath46 .",
    "the moments used to set these constraints are computed using the hqe , where the perturbative part currently includes corrections up to @xmath53 @xcite and power corrections are included through @xmath22 .",
    "the separation between the perturbative component and the power ",
    "correction terms is based on a hard momentum cutoff ( @xmath54 gev ) in the `` kinetic scheme '' , which has the advantage that the input parameters ( in particular @xmath23 and @xmath18 ) can be taken directly from fits to the @xmath12 moments .    similarly to the @xmath12 analysis both the power expansion and the perturbative expansion expressions are used .",
    "it is fair to say that the generalization of the hard cutoff approach beyond the level of a single gluon ( possibly dressed ) is difficult to implement .",
    "] can be improved once higher  order corrections are known .",
    "the use of a hard cutoff on the gluon energy ( the `` kinetic scheme '' ) eliminates the sensitivity to multiple soft emission rendering the expansion better convergent .",
    "nevertheless a single  logarithmic collinear divergence persists , and can in principle be resummed .    in this approach the parameters in @xmath55 , @xmath56",
    "are fixed a new at each given value of @xmath49 , based on the moment constraints .",
    "thus , the way these parameters vary with @xmath49 is indirectly determined by the hqe .",
    "this issue becomes crucial at large @xmath49 , where the hqe breaks down : the final  state hadronic system is then soft . while the contribution from this phase  space region is small ( it is power suppressed ) the spectrum there is clearly not well under control . ref .",
    "@xcite provides an interesting analysis of the breakdown of the hqe in this region and relates it to the presence of @xmath22 weak annihilation contributions , centered at @xmath57 .",
    "the contributions from the large@xmath49 region are parametrized making a conservative estimate of their size .",
    "even then the impact of the weak annihilation contributions on the average value of @xmath0 is just @xmath58  @xcite , which is less than the parametric uncertainty due to @xmath23 dependence .",
    "having said that , ref .",
    "@xcite has clearly demonstrated that further experimental input on the @xmath49 distribution and moments , measured separately for charged and neutral b mesons , would be important for reducing the uncertainty on @xmath0 .    to summarize , the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite is cautious : it uses the well  understood ( and well tested ! ) theoretical framework of the hqe for carefully selected moments , and assumes very little beyond that .",
    "it relies however , on extensive parametrization , dealing with three non - perturbative functions @xmath55 of _ two kinematic variables _ , whose properties are unknown . the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite therefore took special care to consider a large class of functions and further devised means to assess whether this class is large enough .",
    "in this way they managed to provide a reliable prediction for the triple differential spectrum over the entire phase space without dealing directly with the difficult kinematic region where the hadronic system is jet - like . in the following i present other theoretical approaches that instead consider directly this region",
    "the shape  function approach by neubert and collaborators  @xcite deals directly with the important kinematic region where @xmath59 .",
    "this is done by establishing a modified expansion in inverse powers of the mass , where at each order the dynamical effects that are associated with soft gluons , @xmath60 , are summed into non - perturbative shape functions . at leading power",
    "there is one such function , the momentum distribution function defined in ( [ sf_def ] ) above ; beyond this order there are several different functions with additional fields insertions . to extend the calculation beyond this particular region , it is constructed to match the standard hqe when integrated over a significant part of the phase space . in this way two systematic expansions in inverse powers of the mass",
    "are used together .",
    "the modified expansion in shape functions is developed , following the soft collinear effective theory ( scet ) methodology  @xcite , for the particular kinematic region where the final  state is jet - like @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and thus @xmath63 , the region into which a large fraction of the events fall .",
    "the large ( parametric ) hierarchy between these scales implies loss of quantum  mechanical coherence between the respective excitations , leading to factorization into three different subprocesses  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the result , at leading power in @xmath39 , can be expressed as a convolution integral  @xcite : @xmath64 where @xmath65 . here",
    "@xmath66 stand for _ hard _ , depending on momenta of @xmath67 , @xmath68 for _ jet _ , depending on momenta of @xmath69 and @xmath70 for _ soft _ , depending on momenta of @xmath71 and is therefore considered as a non - perturbative object , to be parametrized .",
    "similar factorization formulae apply at subleading powers in @xmath39 , leading to the following expression for the differential width : @xmath72 the matching into the standard hqe translates into constraints on the moments of the shape functions .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have defined the separation between the leading term and the power corrections using a factorization procedure that is based on dimensional regularization .",
    "they parametrize the shape functions directly at the intermediate ( jet ) scale @xmath73 ( in practice @xmath74 gev is used ) and thus avoid ever dealing with softer momentum scales .",
    "both the hard and the jet functions are computed in perturbation theory . owing to the presence of well - separated scales , the jet energy @xmath67 and its mass @xmath69 the perturbative expansion contains large sudakov logarithms . ref .",
    "@xcite resum these logarithms to all orders with high logarithmic accuracy ( next  to  next  to  leading log , nnll ) . the hard coefficient function",
    "is currently computed at @xmath29 .",
    "variation of the matching scale is used to estimate missing higher  order corrections .",
    "this translates into about @xmath75 uncertainty on the average value of @xmath0 .",
    "the functional forms of the shape functions are unknown , and they are therefore parametrized .",
    "the first two moments of the leading shape function are reasonably well constrained : they are fixed by @xmath23 and @xmath18 respectively ; higher moments are not well constrained .",
    "subleading shape functions are difficult to constrain .    to summarize , the method of ref .",
    "@xcite makes extensive use of the available theoretical tools , employing consistently two expansions that are valid in two different kinematic regimes : the expansion in shape functions , valid for the typical final  state momentum configuration , and the standard hqe , valid for the fully integrated width .",
    "further to that , sudakov resummation for the jet - scale logarithms is employed at nnll accuracy . by using a relatively high factorization scale",
    "the perturbative calculation remains insensitive to the infrared , and converges well .",
    "all ingredients , the power expansions as well as the perturbative ones , can in principle be improved systematically by including higher  order terms .    the motivation to go to subleading powers in a completely general way",
    ", however , has a price : one needs to parametrize several different subleading shape functions on which there is no theoretical control nor experimental input . despite this , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite have demonstrated that the experimentally  relevant partial branching fractions remain under good control : their sensitivity to the unknown higher moments of the leading shape function as well as to the unknown functional form of the subleading shape functions is small : the estimated effect of these unknowns on the average value of @xmath0 is less than @xmath76 ! the largest uncertainty in the determination of @xmath0 is the parametric one , owing to the strong dependence on @xmath23 .",
    "a common feature of the two approaches described so far is the extensive use of parametrization of non - perturbative functions .",
    "the fact that these functions all have a clear field ",
    "theoretic definition does not presently help in their parametrization .",
    "to improve on that one needs to avoid introducing an explicit cutoff @xmath77 .",
    "this is indeed possible .",
    "it is well  known that inclusive observables , such as moments of decay spectra , are _ infrared  safe _ observables . in other words , in the absence a cutoff soft  gluons divergences cancels out in the sum of real and virtual diagrams , making the moments finite at any order in perturbation theory . in the following",
    "i shall describe a resummation  based approach , where a cutoff is not used and consequently one relies less on parametrization .",
    "the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite uses resummed perturbation theory in moment  space to provide a perturbative calculation of the on - shell decay spectrum in the entire phase space without introducing any external momentum cutoff ; non - perturbative effects are taken into account as power corrections in moment space .",
    "resummation is applied to both the ` jet ' function and the ` soft ' ( quark distribution ) function , dealing directly with the double hierarchy of scales characterizing the decay process .",
    "consequently , the shape of the spectrum in the kinematics region where the final state is jet - like is largely determined by a calculation , and less by parametrization .",
    "the resummation method employed , dge , combines sudakov and renormalon resummation .",
    "sudakov logarithms are resummed with high logarithmic accuracy ( nnll ) for both the ` jet ' and the ` soft ' functions .",
    "renormalon resummation is an essential element in implementing a consistent separation between perturbative and non - perturbative corrections at the power level",
    "@xcite have adopted the principal value procedure to regularized the sudakov exponent and thus _ define _ the non - perturbative parameters .",
    "this is in full analogy  @xcite with the way a momentum cutoff is conventionally used .",

    "this is taken into account in the parametric uncertainty quoted in table  [ vub_tab ] . because the effect of changing @xmath23 on @xmath123 acts in the same direction as in the total width , their product , which enters the determination of @xmath0 in ( [ deltab ] ) , is highly sensitive to @xmath23 .",
