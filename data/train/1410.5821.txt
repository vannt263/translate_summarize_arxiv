    "void galaxies , found occupying large ( @xmath220 mpc ) underdense void regions , are an environmentally defined population whose isolated nature and extreme environment provides an ideal opportunity to test theories of galaxy formation and evolution ( see e.g. @xcite for a review ) .",
    "they are typically small , gas - rich disk galaxies @xcite that are systematically bluer with higher rates of star formation @xcite , suggesting they are less evolved than galaxies of comparable mass in higher density environments .",
    "this arises naturally from @xmath0cdm cosmology , as the reduced matter density in voids results in a longer time between mergers and thus slower evolution @xcite . to date",
    ", some of the lowest metallicity galaxies have been discovered within void environments @xcite , but the connection with the large - scale environment is not clear @xcite .",
    "cosmological models of galaxy formation predict that void galaxies should be younger and thus more metal poor compared to ` field ' populations of dwarf galaxies @xcite .",
    "previous work studying galaxies in the nearby lynx - cancer void show systematically lower metallicities for a range of luminosities @xcite , with significant ( @xmath20.15 dex ) offset to lower metallicities for the dwarf galaxies in their sample .",
    "however , the lynx - cancer void galaxy study is restricted to a single nearby void environment , and at a distance of 18 mpc it is more difficult to constrain the extent of the void and reliably determine true void membership . here",
    "we measure the gas - phase oxygen abundances of eight h  i rich dwarf galaxies in seven voids using mods1 at the lbt .",
    "this sample allows us to test our understanding of the effects of the void environment on the evolution of dwarf galaxies , and provides constraints on the gas content and metallicity for this population that must be matched by simulations .",
    "+      +     we observed hii regions in eight galaxies using the mods1 instrument at the lbt in spring 2014 .",
    "these galaxies were discovered serendipitously within the survey region of an h  i study of void galaxies as part of the void galaxy survey ( vgs , @xcite ) .",
    "the eight dwarf void galaxies reside in seven different voids , with the void boundaries entirely contained within the sdss redshift survey .",
    "imaging , when available , generally reveals only a single hii region @xcite .",

    "these mechanisms are also thought to regulate the development of the metallicity to luminosity ( or stellar mass ) relation observed over the full range in galaxy stellar mass @xcite .",
    "detailed study of the h  i morphology and kinematics in void galaxies shows evidence of ongoing accretion of gas @xcite , potentially through a cold mode of accretion @xcite .",
    "cold accretion , in particular , should enable pristine gas to penetrate directly to the central star - forming region of the galaxy disk , and be immediately available to form stars . this accretion mode is seen in simulations to play an important role in low mass halos , which are preferentially found both at high redshift and in low density environments at z=0 @xcite .    if we believe cold accretion is more prevalent in voids , then the lack of offset within the metallicity - luminosity relation in our void dwarf galaxy sample suggests inflows alone do not play a significant role in driving the metallicity evolution of dwarf galaxies .",
    "some evidence for this may be seen directly in kk246 , a dwarf galaxy in the local void , which shows evidence of gas accretion @xcite yet has a metallicity typical for its size @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption that gas accretion is directly available to form stars may fail in the case where accreted gas forms an extended disk , well beyond the optical disk where star formation is observed to occur . in kk246 , the h  i extends out to five times the optical radius . as the h  i detected in the eight galaxies presented in this letter is largely unresolved ( figure [ fig : ha ] ) we can not comment directly on the role the distribution of the h  i plays in these galaxies .",
    "additionally , four of the eight void dwarf galaxies have massive nearby companions that are clearly interacting in h  i. it may be expected that these companions pre - enrich the gas in - falling onto the neighboring dwarfs @xcite , however , again we see no systematic difference between these and the isolated void dwarf galaxies .",
    "in fact vgs_30a , which is only 17  kpc from a massive companion , shows the smallest effective yield relative to the closed box model ( figure [ fig : spec ] ) .",
    "these results suggest it is more likely the outflow of enriched material that drives the metallicity - luminosity relation .",
    "as this is an internal process operating independently of the surrounding large - scale environment , it is reasonable that the majority of void galaxies will not show a significant deviation from the established relation .",
    "this may not hold true in specific cases , such as in low surface brightness void galaxies @xcite where the star formation may be more distributed and thus less efficient in driving outflows .",
    "this may also fail in cases where the surrounding environment is more dense , such as clusters or groups .",
    "we find that the gas - phase metallicity of these void dwarf galaxies does not differ significantly from typical dwarf galaxies at fixed luminosity , this alone is a surprising result , as it indicates that galaxy evolution proceeds largely independent of significant differences in the surrounding large - scale environment . in this way ,",
    "void galaxies provide a well constrained population of galaxies that are ideal for detailed study of the internal physical processes that drive galaxy evolution .",
