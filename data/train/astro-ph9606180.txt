    "in a prophetical paper of 1946 , bruno pontecorvo @xcite reviewed the arguments for the existence of neutrinos ( at that time based mainly on conservation laws ) and stated : + `` _ direct proof of the existence of the neutrino  must be based on experiments , the interpretation of which does not require the law of conservation of energy , i.e. , on experiments in which some characteristic process produced by",
    " is observed_. '' + then he pointed out the relevance of inverse beta decay for neutrino detection and outlined the physics potential of neutrinos from nuclear reactors .",
    "he also mentioned solar neutrinos : `` _ the neutrino flux from the sun is of the order of 10@xmath1 neutrinos/@xmath2/sec .",
    "the neutrinos emitted by the sun , however , are not very energetic  _ '' . in 1946",
    "pontecorvo was not optimistic about solar neutrino detection .",
    "since then , solar neutrino physics has made enormous progress , with a significant acceleration during the last decade .    from the seventies to the first half of the eighties the only result",
    "was that of the chlorine experiment @xcite , essentially implying an observed @xmath3b neutrino flux lower than that predicted by standard solar models ( ssms ) .",
    "many physicists were not convinced of the existence of a solar neutrino problem , mainly because of the uncertainties in estimating the flux of the rare , high energy @xmath3b neutrinos . in 1989 @xcite results from the kamiokande experiment",
    "were presented , confirming the low @xmath3b neutrino flux . however , as observed by bahcall and bethe @xcite , the comparison between kamiokande and chlorine data implied an additional puzzle .",
    "as the chlorine experiment is also sensitive to @xmath0be neutrinos , if one subtracts from the cl signal the @xmath3b contribution as implied by kamiokande data ( for standard neutrinos ) , no room is left for @xmath0be neutrinos .",
    "thus the problem started involving also these less energetic neutrinos , for which the theoretical predictions are much more robust . at the beginning of the nineties ,",
    "the results of gallium experiments ( gallex @xcite and sage @xcite ) became available ; for these the signal is expected to depend primarily on pp neutrinos , but to a lesser extent also on @xmath0be neutrinos and on @xmath3b neutrinos . in both gallium experiments",
    "the signals were again significantly smaller than the ssm predictions .",
    "the exposure of the gallium detectors to a @xmath4cr neutrino source @xcite was important for confirming quantitatively the sensitivity of the apparatus for neutrino detection .    by combining the results of the various experiments , it became possible to obtain relevant information on neutrinos independently of solar models .",
    "as we shall see , the solar neutrino experiments tell us that the following assumptions are most likely contradictory :    * neutrino properties are correctly described by the minimal standard model of electroweak interactions (  `` standard '' neutrinos ) . *",
    "solar energy arriving onto earth is produced in the sun by nuclear reactions of the form : + @xmath5@xmath6he  @xmath7 .",
    "since there is little doubt that the sun , as many other stars , is powered by the conversion of hydrogen into helium , then experiments point towards some non - standard neutrino properties and  as was the case in 1946  energy conservation becomes again a key tool , albeit an indirect one , for the study of neutrinos .",
    "this paper attempts to answer the following questions :    \\i ) which information on neutrino properties can be obtained directly from solar neutrino experiments , independently  as much as possible  of solar models ?",
    "\\ii ) how much room  if any  is still open for an astrophysical or nuclear physics solution of the solar neutrino puzzle ?    as the ssm has to be abandoned in face of the clear disagreement with all experiments , we shall present a systematic analysis of non - standard solar models (  models where some input parameter is varied beyond its estimated uncertainty ) , in order to explore the possibility of reconciling theory and experiments .",
    "as we are writing this paper , a generation of solar neutrino experiments has been essentially completed . in preparation for the exciting future experiments ( superkamiokande  @xcite , borexino  @xcite , sno  @xcite , hellaz  @xcite ,  ) , it is time to summarize what we have learnt so far .    in the minimal standard model of electroweak interactions , neutrinos are massless and consequently there is no mixing among weak flavour states .",
    "also their magnetic moments vanish and they are stable .",
    "the experimental hint of non - standard neutrino properties (  masses , mixing , magnetic moments , possible decay schemes ,  ) thus seems to indicate some physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the present situation looks to us very similar to the one described by pontecorvo in 1946 : just change the word _ existence _ to _ non - standard properties _ , in the sense that solar neutrino experiments together with energy conservation strongly point towards non - standard neutrino properties .",
    "much as in 1946 , the future of neutrino physics now demands experiments yielding decisive * direct * evidence of non - standard neutrino properties .      in the first section we present a short and simple introduction to the field for non experts , reviewing : i ) hydrogen burning in the sun and neutrino production , ii ) the predictions of standard solar models ( ssm ) and iii ) the results of solar neutrino experiments .    in the next section",
    "we discuss the information on neutrino fluxes which can be derived directly from experiments , almost independently of solar models , assuming standard neutrinos .",
    "this is the main part of our review , as it is meant to demonstrate that , * for standard neutrinos * :    * the available experimental results appear to be mutually inconsistent , even dismissing one out of the four experiments . * even neglecting these inconsistencies , the flux of intermediate energy neutrinos ( be+cno ) as derived from experiments is significantly smaller than the prediction of ssm s .",
    "* the different reductions of the @xmath0be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes with respect to the ssm predictions are essentially in contradiction with the fact that both @xmath0be and @xmath3b neutrinos originate from the same parent @xmath0be nuclei .    in sec .",
    "[ cap3 ] we describe a strategy for building non - standard solar models leading to reduced @xmath0be and @xmath3b neutrino fluxes .",
    "there are essentially two ways : i ) producing models with smaller central solar temperatures ; ii ) playing with the nuclear cross sections which determine the branches of the fusion chain . in the same section",
    "we introduce some algorithms for discussing the non - standard models , to be presented in the subsequent sections : we essentially seek parameterizations of the results ( neutrino fluxes and physical quantities characterizing the solar interior ,  ) in terms of the input quantity which is being varied .    in section  [ cap4 ] we examine non - standard solar models with a central temperature @xmath8 different from the ssm prediction . clearly the central temperature is not a free parameter , its value being fixed by the equations of stellar structure and by the physical inputs one is relying on .",
    "we present a systematic analysis for the variations of several physical inputs ( s@xmath9 , opacity tables , chemical composition , age ,  ) affecting @xmath8 .",
    "an interesting feature common to the large majority of the models that we examined , is that the radial temperature profiles appear largely unchanged , aside from a scaling factor which can be evaluated , , as the ratio of central temperatures .",
    "thus , the profile is the same for a given value of @xmath8 independently of which parameter is varied in order to obtain that central temperature .",
    "this allows one to compare experimental data with the theoretical predictions as a function of just one parameter , namely @xmath8 .",
    "section  [ cap5 ] is devoted to the rle of the nuclear cross sections which can influence the branching ratios of the p - p chain .",
    "we discuss in detail the rle of the he+he reactions and we consider possible effects of to screening of nuclear charges by the stellar plasma .",
    "we also discuss the rle of the p+@xmath0be reaction .    in section  [ cap6 ]",
    "we compare the non - standard solar models just built with experimental data .",
    "we also consider hybrid models , where both @xmath8 and nuclear cross sections are varied simultaneously .",
    "all our attempts to reconcile theory and experiments having failed , we conclude that    * for standard neutrinos , the present experimental data look in disagreement not only with the standard solar model , but with any solar model that we are able to build .    in the appendix a , we specify our standard solar model in some detail .",
    "we concentrate here on our own calculations as we obviously have for these a more detailed knowledge of the physical and chemical inputs and of outputs of the code .",
    "in fact , several groups have produced in the last few years updated and accurate standard solar model calculations @xcite . in this paper",
    "we shall not give a systematic presentation of these .",
    "we also do not describe solar neutrino experiments nor helioseismology .",
    "all these matters are excellently covered in other review works , ,    - bahcall s book @xcite and papers in review of modern physics  @xcite , all extremely useful , centered around standard solar models .",
    "- the report by koshiba  @xcite , providing a fascinating journey through the experimental techniques of neutrino astrophysics .",

    "the discovery of the enormous energy stored in nuclei early led astrophysicists to speculate that reactions among nuclear species were the source of the energy in stars : +  _",
    "certain physical investigations in the past year make it probable to my mind that some portion of sub - atomic energy is actually being set free in a star .",
    " aston has  shown  that the mass of the helium atom is less than the sum of the masses of the four hydrogen atoms which enter into it .",
    " now mass can not be annihilated , and the deficit can only represent the energy set free in the transmutation .  if five per cent of a star s mass consists initially of hydrogen atoms , which are gradually being combined to form more complex elements , the total heat liberated will more than suffice for our demands , and we need look no further for the source of a star s energy  _ ( eddington 1920 )  @xcite .",
    "+ after the discovery of the tunnel effect in 1928  @xcite , atkinson and houtermans presented the first qualitative theoretical approach to the problem  @xcite . from the nuclear data available to them and",
    "the already known fact that hydrogen is the most abundant element in the sun and the universe , they concluded that the energy - producing mechanism involved primarily hydrogen , as suggested by eddington .",
    "as a matter of fact , the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form helium is still the only known process that can supply the required power for the long solar life .",
    "hydrogen burning can be represented symbolically by the `` fusion '' reaction : @xmath10 the total energy released in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) is q= 26.73 mev and only a small part of it ( about 0.6 mev ) is carried away by the two neutrinos .    from the solar radiative flux at the earth , called the solar constant @xmath11mev @xmath12 s@xmath13 @xcite",
    ", one immediately derives the total flux @xmath14 of electron neutrinos arriving on the earth , if they are not lost _ en route _",
    "( by neglecting the small fraction of energy carried by neutrinos ) : @xmath15    the definite proof of nuclear energy production in the solar core lies in the detection of solar neutrinos .",
    "since the cross sections for neutrino detection depend strongly on neutrino energy , the energy spectrum of solar neutrinos has to be known and that requires a detailed knowledge of the reactions summarized by eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .      in stellar interiors ,",
    "nuclear interactions between charged particles ( nuclei ) occur at collision energies @xmath16 well below the height of the coulomb barrier and are only possible due to the tunnel effect , with a characteristic probability @xcite : @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath18 are the atomic numbers of the colliding nuclei and @xmath19 is their reduced mass .",
    "the lightest elements thus react most easily and the conversion of h into he is the first chain of nuclear reactions which can halt the contraction of a new - born stellar structure and settle stars in the so - called main sequence phase .",
    "the mechanisms for hydrogen burning were first elucidated in the late 1930s independently by von weizscker and bethe and critchfield @xcite ; from their works it became clear that two different sets of reactions could convert sufficient hydrogen into helium to provide the energy needed for a star s luminosity , namely the proton - proton ( p - p ) chain and the cno bi - cycle , which we are going to review briefly ( see @xcite for a more extended presentation ) .",
    "at the temperature and density characteristic of the solar interior , hydrogen burns with the largest probability ( 98% ) through the pp chain .",
    "this develops through the nuclear reactions presented in fig .",
    "[ catenapp ] , where we show the different possible branches .",
    "the chain starts with a weak interaction process , either the pp or the pep reaction .",
    "the mechanisms for these two reactions are very similar and hence the ratio of pep to pp reaction probabilities is fixed almost independently of the details of the solar model ; at the densities of the solar interior ( @xmath20150 g/@xmath21 ) the three body process has a smaller probability .",
    "the deuterons produced quickly burn into @xmath22he  as a consequence of the much larger cross section of the electromagnetic process d+p@xmath23@xmath22he",
    "+ @xmath24 .",
    "after @xmath22he production , several branches occur .",
    "the hep reaction turns out to have a negligible rate and will not be discussed further . even if the @xmath22he abundance remains a factor 10@xmath6 lower than that of @xmath6he in the energy production region , the @xmath22he+@xmath22he @xmath23 @xmath6he  + 2p reaction is favoured with respect to @xmath22he+@xmath6he@xmath25be+@xmath24 , because the probability of the reaction mediated by strong interaction is four orders of magnitude larger than that of the electromagnetic process and because the tunnelling probability through the coulomb barrier for the case of the lighter @xmath22he  nuclei is a factor ten larger .    with the @xmath22he+@xmath22he reaction the chain reaches one of the possible terminations ( pp - i chain ) . on the other hand , after the @xmath22he+@xmath6he reaction , the chain branches again at the @xmath0be level , due to the competition between electron and proton capture . note that , at the temperatures of the solar interior , the electron capture ( although it is a weak process ) dominates over the electromagnetic reaction since it has no coulomb barrier .",
    "the chain passing through the @xmath0be+e@xmath26 reaction is called pp - ii chain , and the one involving the @xmath0be+p reaction is called pp - iii chain .    to conclude this overview of the pp chain we remark that the basic process in any case is the aggregation of four protons to form a @xmath6he  nucleus , the isotopes @xmath27h , @xmath22he , @xmath0be , @xmath0li and @xmath3b being intermediate products which are created and destroyed along the chain , their number densities staying constant ( and small ) when the chain reaches equilibrium .    regarding the neutrino production we note that :    \\i ) in the pp - i chain only pp or pep neutrinos",

    "note that the efficiency of the process is determined by the reaction with the smallest cross section , which clearly is p+@xmath36n @xmath37o + @xmath24 , an electromagnetic process with the largest coulomb repulsion .      according to the theory of stellar structure and evolution",

    "the evaluation of @xmath38 is a rather complex task , but the results have been continuously improving over the years . at present",

    "according to stix @xcite , `` _ the standard model of the sun could be defined as the model which is based on the most plausible assumptions_. '' this means that physical and chemical inputs are chosen at the central values of experimental / observational / theoretical results .",
    "we prefer to call such a model the reference solar model ( rsm ) ; throughout this review we use as such the `` best model with diffusion '' of bahcall and pinsonneault  @xcite denoted as bp95 .",
    "more generally , let us * define a standard solar model ( ssm ) as one which reproduces , within uncertainties , the observed properties of the sun , by adopting a set of physical and chemical inputs chosen within the range of their uncertainties*.    the actual sun has a mass m@xmath45 g  @xcite and a radius r@xmath46 cm  @xcite . denoting by x , y and z the relative mass abundances of h , he and heavier elements respectively ( x+y+z = 1 ) , the present ratio of heavy elements ( metallicity ) to hydrogen in the photosphere is ( z / x)@xmath47@xcite . at the age t@xmath48 gyr @xcite , the sun is producing a luminosity l@xmath49 erg / sec @xcite .",
    "if a complete information about the ( initial ) photospheric composition was available and if the theory of stellar models was capable to predict stellar radii firmly , then there would be no free parameter .",
    "the theoretical model should account for the solar luminosity and radius at the solar age , without tuning any parameters .",
    "the photospheric helium abundance is however not strongly constrained by direct observations , since no helium line exists at the photospheric depth , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a critical discussion ( helioseismology can however provide some indirect information , see later ) . furthermore , the present observed photospheric composition is different from the initial one due to diffusion and gravitational settling .",
    "moreover , the radii ( but only the radii ) of stars with convective envelopes (  the sun ) depend on the assumption made about the convective transport , as we shall discuss later on . as a consequence",
    ", one has the freedom of adjusting some parameters in the course of the calculation .    in order to produce a standard solar model ,",
    "one studies the evolution of an initially homogeneous solar mass up to the sun age . to obtain l@xmath50 , r@xmath50 and ( z / x)@xmath51 at",
    ", one can tune three parameters : the initial helium abundance y , the metal abundance z and a third quantity related to the efficiency of convection ( see below ) .",
    "the effects of these parameters can be understood simply .",
    "the luminosity of the sun ( more generally of any star in the main sequence ) depends in a rather sensitive way on the initial helium content y ; increasing it , the initial sun is brighter and a given luminosity is reached in a shorter time . since the ratio z / x is constrained by observational data , y and z can not be chosen independently : if y increases , z must decrease .    to get the proper radius r@xmath50 ,",
    "one adjusts the efficiency of the external convection , which dominates the energy transport in the outer layers of the sun ( about the outer 30% of the solar radius ) .",
    "the precise description of the convection in the external part of the sun is an essentially unsolved problem , and the process is commonly described in terms of a phenomenological model , the so - called `` mixing length theory '' , see  ref .",
    "@xcite . following this approach , we define the mixing length @xmath52 as the distance over which a moving unit of gas can be identified before it mixes appreciably . this length is related to the pressure scale height @xmath53=1/ ( @xmath54lnp/@xmath54r ) through @xmath55 where @xmath56 is assumed to be independent of the radial coordinate and it is used as free parameter . by varying @xmath56 , one varies the mixing length and thus the convection efficiency , which determines the solar radius . thus if @xmath56 is increased , convection becomes more efficient , the temperature gradient smaller and the surface temperature higher . since the solar luminosity is fixed , the radius has to decrease .    in the last few years",
    ", one of the principal improvements of ssms was the treatment of element diffusion @xcite .",
    "noerdlinger ( 1977 ) first included the effects of he diffusion on the evolution of the sun , while cox , guzic and kidman ( 1989 ) were the first to take into account the settling of heavy elements .",
    "the stronger pull of gravity on helium and heavier elements causes them to diffuse slowly downward , relative to hydrogen . as a result ,",
    "if diffusion is taken into account , helium and heavier elements in the solar photosphere are depleted with respect to their abundance in the original mixture .",
    "we remark that , as a strong simplification , the sun is taken as spherically symmetric ,  all physical quantities vary only radially .",
    "this relies on the assumption that the internal rotation is sufficiently slow  @xcite and the internal magnetic fields are sufficiently weak so that the corresponding forces are negligible .",
    "all in all , it looks that a solar model has three ( essentially ) free parameters , @xmath56 , y , and ( z / x)@xmath57 , and produces three numbers that can be directly measured : the present radius , luminosity and heavy element content of the photosphere .",
    "this may not look as a big accomplishment . at this stage ,",
    "one s confidence in the standard solar models actually rests on the success of stellar evolution theory to describe many , and more complex , evolutionary phases in good agreement with observational data .    in recent years",
    "however , helioseismology has added important data on the solar structure , which provide severe constraints and tests of standard solar model calculations .",
    "helioseismology can accurately determine the depth of the convective zone and the speed of sound @xmath58 at the transition radius r@xmath59 between convective and radiative transport  @xcite : @xmath60 the indicated range for r@xmath59 has been confirmed recently  @xcite .",
    "actually , within the present uncertainties , the information on r@xmath59 and on @xmath58 are not independent , since to the per cent level , @xmath58 and r@xmath59 are related through @xcite : @xmath61    several determinations of the helium photospheric abundances have been derived from inversion ( deconvolution ) of helioseismological data , yielding ( see table  [ elios ] ) : @xmath62 one should note that the small errors often quoted generally reflect the observational frequency errors only .",

    "by varying y and @xmath56 , and adjusting ( z / x)@xmath57 within the observed range , all models are able to reproduce , and ( z / x)@xmath51 at the solar age .",
    "the comparison with helioseismological measurements , which provide additional constraints , is interesting , see fig .",

    "the importance of diffusion for achieving agreement with helioseismological data is discussed in appendix a.    * we shall consider as standard solar models ( ssms ) only those models which pass the helioseismological tests*. we recall that , among these , * we shall refer to bp95 `` best model with diffusion '' @xcite as to the reference solar model ( rsm)*.    from table  [ modelli ] one sees that calculated central temperatures are in agreement at the per cent level .    as a matter of fact",
    ", this shows that building up a stellar model is by now a well - established and reliable procedure , the small differences being essentially the result of small variations in the assumed input physics . at the same time , this agreement indicates the consensus about the treatment of the rather sophisticated physics needed to account for the behaviour of stellar structures .",
    "concerning neutrinos , the solar model determines the internal distribution of temperature , density and h abundance and , thus , the efficiency of the various chains . in this way one gets the fluxes at earth of the different neutrino components ( @xmath63 ) . from table  [ modellibis ] one notes that :    \\i ) the fluxes of pp neutrinos are stable to a few percent .",

    "we intend to define the errors we adopt , describe what we want to do with these errors , provide some justification to our choice and outline its limits .    concerning experimental errors , we add in quadrature statistical and systematical errors .",
    "we tentatively use this global error as an indicator of the distance between the true and the measured values of a physical quantity , according to the rules of gaussian statistics .",
    "essentially we are assuming that the systematical uncertainty is a variable which can fluctuate according to statistical rules , so that we consider statistical and systematical errors as independent of each other and on the same footing .",
    "this choice seems to be crazy ( and actually it would be in many cases ) , however it has some justification in the present context .    as an example , consider measuring the period of a pendulum using a watch .",
    "this watch is guaranteed to measure time better than one second per day : one does not know if it is fast or slow , but it does not gain or loose more than 1s / day .",
    "this systematical error can not by traced to a single origin ( otherwise it would be eliminated ) , but arises from many different sources , essentially the mechanical tolerances on each of the many components of the watch .",
    "each of these sources gives a small contribution , positive as well as negative , to the final error .",
    "also each contribution is statistically independent from the others . under these conditions",
    "one can reasonably suppose that , if one produces a large number of watches of the same kind , the systematical errors are distributed according to a gaussian with null average ,  the distribution is the same as for statistical fluctuations .",
    "clearly one does not gain any accuracy by repeating the measurements over several oscillations , in exactly the same conditions with the same watch . on",
    "the other hand if one is using n different watches of the same kind ( each one with its systematical error @xmath117s / day ) and combine the results , accuracy is improved , as the chance of having a fast and a slow watch are equal . in other words ,",
    "in this example systematical errors can be treated similarly to statistical fluctuations .",
    "the situation , at least in radiochemical experiments , is somehow similar .",
    "for instance the 33 runs of gallex are actually 33 independent experiments : after each run , the @xmath111ge atoms are extracted in specific conditions , which are independent of the run number , and placed in a new counter .",
    "the radon content of the atmosphere where extraction occurs fluctuates around some mean value , within some systematical uncertainty .",
    "all counters have approximately the same efficiency , again within some systematical uncertainty , but one is better and another is worse than the estimated mean efficiency .",
    "thus the systematical error of the full experiment is significantly reduced with respect to that pertaining to each individual run and , it can approximately be determined by statistical considerations .    the same procedure used to combine different runs can be used in principle to combine two different experiments like sage and gallex .",
    "the resulting systematical error is @xmath118 in analogy to the statistical one @xmath119 and the global error on gallium result becomes @xmath120 this is how eq .",
    "( [ sga ] ) has been obtained .",
    "the situation is more complex when considering errors of theoretical results . when these errors correspond to uncertainties on some measured quantities which are used as input in the theoretical calculations , we are back to the previous case .",
    "often , however , additional uncertainty is added due to extrapolations of experimental data ,  when estimating nuclear cross sections at energies of astrophysical interest . in other cases (  opacity tables )",
    "the only information comes from theoretical calculations . in these cases one can only resort to a comparison among different calculations . a total theoretical range @xmath121 is defined by bahcall as `` _ the range in values of published state - of - the - art calculations _ ''",
    "@xcite , and this might be considered as the equivalent of an experimental three sigma error ,  the probability of being outside this range is about 0.3% .",
    "this looks plausible , how many sigmas being clearly a matter of taste .",
    "we generally adhere to bahcall s choice . for consistency of notations ,",
    "as we always show experimental 1@xmath122 errors , we shall add to the theoretical quantities an error @xmath123    all this clearly means that * treating errors given by equations of the form ( [ somme ] ) or ( [ teorico ] ) as if they were indicators of statistical ( gaussian ) fluctuations is just a rough approximation , or even an undue simplification*.    the confidence levels obtained in this way are thus to be taken _ cum grano salis _ , or much more .",
    "all experiments give signals significantly smaller than those predicted by the rsm and by other ssms , for standard neutrinos .",
    "is this a problem of ssms or is there anything deeper ?",
    "insight on this question can be gained by looking at properties of neutrino fluxes which are largely independent of solar models .",
    "in essence , one is asking if experimental data are in agreement with the following assumptions :    \\a ) the solar luminosity is supported by h burning reactions ;    \\b ) electron neutrinos do not disappear in their travel from sun to earth (  standard neutrinos ) .",
    "the first assumption looks rather innocent , the second one being really the hypothesis to be tested .",

    "we shall show that the experimental results look mutually inconsistent if the above two assumptions hold true .",
    "the point is that the flux of intermediate energy neutrinos ( @xmath1242 mev ) : @xmath125 would have to be negative !",
    "we shall see that the same occurs if we disregard any of the experiments .",
    "actually * we do not know of any sound argument to doubt the experimental results , but we shall entertain this possibility , just as a working hypothesis * , to test the consistency of the assertion : neutrinos are standard and ( some ) experiments are correct .",
    "we would like to make this point as clear as possible : when saying `` disregard one experiment '' or `` assume it is wrong '' we are advocating some hypothetical , large , unknown systematic error , just for the sake of saving / testing the hypothesis of standard neutrinos .",
    "this is clearly a desperate hypothesis , at least for @xmath4cr - calibrated gallium detectors .",
    "the inconsistencies will be derived by treating the different components of the neutrino flux as essentially free parameters .",
    "additional information can be gained from the physical relationships among the neutrino components , as imposed by the development of the fusion chains .",
    "for example , pep neutrinos accompany pp neutrinos , with a proportion which has to be essentially the same in any solar model .",
    "also , if the cn cycle is efficient , there will be about as many @xmath35n  as @xmath32o  neutrinos . by using these additional , however weak , assumptions one gets more severe hints against the hypothesis of standard neutrinos and/or tighter constraints on @xmath0be  and cno neutrino fluxes ( see secs .

    "as compared to the @xmath221 decay , the only complication is that we deal now with several variables ( fluxes ) instead of just one ( the neutrino squared mass ) .",
    "for this reason we resorted to monte carlo techniques .",
    "we generated a large ensemble of sets of four simulated signals ( gallium , chlorine , kamiokande and the solar luminosity ) ; each simulated signal was extracted by a gaussian distribution with mean and width equal to its actual experimental central value and error .",

    "we have chosen not to derive from the simulated signals both @xmath176 and @xmath204 , since the possibility of separating the two signals is critically dependent on the difference between the ratio of the average cross sections for be and cno neutrinos in the chlorine experiment and the same ratio in the gallium experiments . moreover , the limit obtained by assuming either @xmath176 or @xmath204 to be zero is more conservative . note that when we assume @xmath267 , the upper limit on @xmath176 is in fact an upper limit for @xmath176 and for @xmath214 being the cross section for cno neutrinos larger than the one for be neutrinos . in practice",
    "the system of equations giving the signals as functions of the fluxes was inverted with the techniques of singular value decomposition that automatically take care both of the case of almost degenerate equations ( if one decides not to combine the two gallium data ) and of the case of an overdetermined system ( when the apparent fluxes are less than the number of equations ) , giving in this last case effectively the best @xmath268 fit . in summary , we have generated an ensemble of a milion apparent fluxes from the ensemble of a milion simulated experiments . if @xmath176 is positive in this ensemble 60000 times out of a milion , we say that the probability of standard neutrinos is 6% .",
    "the other limits are derived similarly considering different experiments and/or fluxes .",

    "has to be reduced by at least 7% ( 13% ) , which requires the really unreasonable variations given in the last columns of table [ tempera ] .",
    "the input parameters are to be varied by an order of magnitude ( or more ) with respect to their estimated uncertainties .",
    "even a 40% reduction of opacity can only reduce the @xmath0be  neutrino flux by at most a factor two .",

    "this model may be useful for a comparison with the bahcall and pinsonneault model without diffusion , described in ref .",

    "\\b ) next , we introduced the opal equation of state . with respect to",
    "other commonly used eos , this one avoids an ad hoc treatment of the pressure ionization and it provides a systematic expansion in the coulomb coupling parameter that includes various quantum effects generally not included in other computations ( see refs .  @xcite and @xcite for more details ) .",
    "\\c ) we used the latest opal opacity tables  @xcite , solar metallicity ratio as in @xcite and again the molecular opacities of ref .",
    "@xcite for temperature below 10@xmath6 k. with respect to ref .",
    "@xcite the new opal tables include the effects on the opacity of seven additional elements and some minor physics changes ; moreover the temperature grid has been made denser .",
    "\\d ) we included the diffusion of helium and heavy elements .",
    "the diffusion coefficients have been calculated using the subroutine developed by thoul , see ref .",
    "the diffusion equations were integrated numerically . at any time step , after updating the physical and chemical quantities as usually done in franec , we took into account the effect of diffusion .",
    "our time steps are about 3 @xmath612 10 @xmath0 yr . the variations of the abundance of h , he , c , n , o and fe are followed ; all these elements are treated as fully ionized . according to ref .",
    "@xcite all other elements are assumed to diffuse at the same rate as the fully - ionized iron . to account for the effect of heavy element diffusion on the opacity coefficients , we calculated the total heavy elements abundance in each spherical shell in which the solar model is divided and we interpolated ( by a cubic spline interpolation ) between opacity tables with different total metallicity ( z = 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.03 , 0.04 ) .",
    "\\e ) finally , we investigated the effect of updating the nuclear cross sections for @xmath22he+@xmath22he and @xmath22he+@xmath6he reactions , following a recent new analysis of all available data , described in sec .",
    "[ cap5 ] . for @xmath517",
    ", we used the exponential parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ expo34 ] ) .",
    "the resulting solar models are summarized in table  [ modellinoi ] , and deserve the following comments .",
    "( a @xmath23 b ) : the introduction of the new opal eos reduces appreciably the initial helium abundance . the straniero ( 1988 ) eos underestimates the coulomb effects neglecting the contribution due to the electrons , which are considered as completely degenerate , whereas the opal eos includes corrections for coulomb forces which are correctly treated .",
    "the models with straniero eos have a higher central pressure and a higher central temperature , and correspondingly a higher initial helium abundance .",
    "the effect of an underestimated coulomb correction was discussed in ref .",
    "note that the transition between radiative and convective regions is not correctly predicted by the model , the convective region being definitely too shallow .",
    "( b @xmath23 c ) : the updating of the radiative opacity coefficients has minor effects .",
    "the convective zone is again too shallow .",
    "( c @xmath23 d ) : this step shows the effects of diffusion .",
    "helium and heavy elements sink relative to hydrogen in the radiative interior of the star because of the combined effect of gravitational settling and of thermal diffusion .",
    "this increases the molecular weight in the core and thus the central temperature raises .",
    "the surface abundances of hydrogen , helium and heavy elements are appreciably affected by diffusion .",
    "for example , the initial value y@xmath57  =  0.269 is reduced to the present photospheric value y@xmath51  =  0.238 , the predicted depth of the convective zone and the sound speed are now in good agreement with helioseismological values .",
    "it is natural that when diffusion is included the radiative region reduces its size . with respect to models without diffusion , in the external regions",
    "the present helium fraction is reduced while the metal fraction stays at the observed photospheric value .",
    "thus the opacity increases and convection starts deeper in the sun .",
    "( d @xmath23 e ) : the modifications of our solar model arising from the new values of the nuclear cross sections are negligible with respect to the other improvements just presented .",
    "the predicted neutrino fluxes and signals are summarized in table  [ flussinoi ] for our models .",
    "all in all , the results are quite stable with respect to the changes we have introduced as long as diffusion is neglected . on the other hand , due to the higher central temperature , model d ) has significantly higher @xmath3b and cno neutrino fluxes .",
    "it is essentially the increase of @xmath178 which enhances the predicted chlorine signal .",
    "the slight change in the nuclear cross sections weakly affect neutrino fluxes and signals .",
    "the @xmath0be and @xmath3b fluxes are reduced by about 5% as a consequence of the correspondingly smaller value of @xmath517 ( see table  [ flussinoi ] ) .",
    "should we use the polynomial expansion of eq .",
    "( [ poli34 ] ) one would get a further 5% decrease .",
    "we already compared the predictions of standard solar models by different authors in sec .",
    "[ cap1 ] , see also table [ modellibis ] . we discuss here the stability of the ratios @xmath189 and @xmath190 among the non - standard solar models which we have built in section [ cap4 ] .    figs .",
    "[ figapp1 ] and [ figapp2 ] show the situations as some input parameter ( @xmath321 , z / x ,  ) is varied by a scaling factor @xmath613 . in all the presented models ,",
    "the central temperatures differ by that of the starting solar model by no more than 5% .",
    "the following features are to be remarked :        \\iii ) as in all models we considered the central temperature is smaller or equal to that of the starting solar model , the rate of the key reaction p+@xmath36n@xmath614o is reduced and the cn chain is less equilibrated , resulting in a smaller @xmath32o neutrino production , which accounts for @xmath615 systematically . on the other hand",
    "the behaviour of @xmath78 looks erratical : it may increase as well as decrease when the central temperature is reduced , presumably since @xmath78 is sensitive to the electron density more than to the temperature .",
