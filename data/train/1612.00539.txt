    "the falconer distance problem , introduced in @xcite , can be stated as follows : how large does the hausdorff dimension of @xmath11 need to be to ensure that the euclidean distance set @xmath12 has positive one - dimensional lebesgue measure ?",
    "this problem can be viewed as a continuous analogue of the famous erds distinct distance problem @xcite .",
    "the current best partial results , due to wolff @xcite in the plane and erdoan @xcite in higher dimensions , say that the one - dimensional lebesgue measure of @xmath13 , denoted @xmath14 , is indeed positive if @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 .",
    "as distance is a configuration that only involves two points , analogous questions can be posed for configurations that involve more points .",
    "for example , we may consider the set of noncongruent triples of points in @xmath2 , that is , points which form noncongruent triangles . in the discrete",
    "setting such questions have been studied for decades @xcite , while recently there has been a flurry of activity in the continuous setting where angles @xcite , simplices @xcite , volumes @xcite , and a more general approach to multi - point configurations @xcite have been examined .    in this paper",
    "the point configurations we focus on are simplices . for @xmath17 and @xmath18 we say , following @xcite , that the _ set of distinct noncongruent @xmath3-simplices determined by @xmath19 _",
    "is @xmath20 , where @xmath21 provided that @xmath22 , @xmath23 form non - degenerate @xmath3-simplices and @xmath24 for all @xmath25 .",
    "we can map @xmath26 by mapping a @xmath3-simplex to the @xmath27-tuple of its distances , thus it makes sense to take the @xmath27-dimensional lebesgue measure of @xmath28 . define @xmath29 to be the infimum of all @xmath30 for which @xmath31 implies @xmath32 . the first falconer type theorem for simplices",
    "was established by greenleaf and iosevich @xcite , where , in the special case of triangles in the plane , they established the upper bound @xmath33 .",
    "this result was extended by grafakos , greenleaf , iosevich and the sixth listed author @xcite to the following upper bound for all simplices in all dimensions : @xmath34 .",
    "these results were further improved by greenleaf , iosevich , lu and the sixth listed author @xcite to @xmath35 and in the general case @xmath36 . using a different approach erdoan , iosevich and",
    "hart @xcite obtained the upper bound @xmath37 , which recently has been improved by greenleaf , iosevich , lu and the sixth listed author @xcite to @xmath38 . in certain situations",
    "these bounds beat the previous ones , but in some of the most natural situations , such as when @xmath39 , they only give trivial information .",
    "all these positive results naturally lead to the question of whether they are sharp . using a set obtained by a suitable scaling of the thickened integer lattice",
    ", falconer @xcite showed a lower bound of @xmath40 for his distance problem , i.e. , @xmath41 .",
    "this led him to conjecture @xmath42 , which remains open . for higher order simplices the trivial observation that @xmath43 had been made .",
    "the first part of the lower bound says that there are not many @xmath3-simplices in a @xmath44-dimensional set , e.g. there are not many triangles on a line .",
    "the second part of the lower bound says that if there are many different @xmath3-simplices then there are many different distances , therefore falconer s lower bound for distances also applies for @xmath3-simplices .",
    "the only non - trivial lower bound for higher order simplices is one for triangles in the plane , obtained by erdoan and iosevich , but first published in @xcite , that says @xmath45 .",
    "this was obtained by counting triangles in an integer lattice .",
    "this brings us to the first result of this paper .",
    "[ thm : alphalowerbound ] for @xmath17 , @xmath46    we observe that this is nontrivial in the range @xmath7 . in the special case @xmath47 , our lower bound combined with the upper bound from @xcite yields @xmath48",
    "we prove theorem [ thm : alphalowerbound ] in section [ sec : countingsimplices ] by using bounds on representations of integers by sums of squares to count simplices in an integer lattice .      in his original paper falconer",
    "obtained the threshold @xmath49 by proving an incidence theorem .",
    "he showed that if the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 is above @xmath50 then uniform estimates for @xmath51 of the form @xmath52 hold for a frostman measure @xmath53 supported on @xmath2 . a frostman measure is a probability measure ,",
    "so one can interpret the above inequality as the probability that @xmath54 is near a fixed distance @xmath55 . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "a similar approach was taken and incidence theorems of the type @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a collection of positive real numbers , were proven .    in @xcite , mattila showed for @xmath58 that falconer s incidence theorem does not in general hold if the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 is strictly less than @xmath59 .",
    "this means that his original approach is sharp in terms of the technique used .",
    "note that this does not imply that his distance theorem is sharp , and as mentioned before , it has since been improved from @xmath50 down to @xmath60 . in @xcite , greenleaf and",
    "iosevich extended mattila s example to triangles in the plane ( @xmath61,@xmath58 ) and showed that the incidence theorem they obtained does not in general hold if the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 is strictly less than @xmath62 , which shows that their incidence theorem is sharp .",
    "again this does not imply that the point configuration problem is sharp and indeed the dimensional threshold was improved to @xmath63 in @xcite .",
    "this brings us to the second result of the paper .",
    "[ prop : lowerboundincidencethm ] for any @xmath3 and @xmath64 where @xmath65 , the incidence estimate for @xmath3-simplices , i.e. , the estimate given in , can fail for measures supported on sets with hausdorff dimension less than @xmath8 .",
    "we prove this proposition in section [ sec : prooflowerboundincidencethm ] by extending the constructions of mattila and greenleaf and iosevich .",
    "we remark that the dimensional threshold obtained in the incidence theorems in @xcite is @xmath66 , so for @xmath67 , unlike the previously mentioned results , there is a gap between the threshold from the construction and the threshold from the incidence theorems .",
    "the key ingredient in both falconer s incidence theorem and the incidence theorem from @xcite is that if @xmath68 denotes the lebesgue measure on the unit sphere , then @xmath69 this implies that both incidence theorems still hold if the euclidean distance @xmath70 is replaced by @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is a symmetric convex body with a smooth boundary and everywhere non - vanishing gaussian curvature .",
    "mattila s construction , which shows his incidence theorem does not in general hold if the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 is strictly less than @xmath50 , was originally proven in the case @xmath58 and extends to @xmath73 but does not seem to extend to higher dimensions .",
    "iosevich and senger @xcite showed , building on a construction by valtr @xcite , that the more general incidence theorem involving a norm derived from a symmetric convex body can fail if the hausdorff dimension of @xmath2 is strictly less than @xmath50 for all @xmath74 .",
    "our third and main result is the following theorem that establishes an analogous result in the case of triangles ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "[ triangles ] for @xmath75 there exists a symmetric convex body @xmath72 with a smooth boundary and non - vanishing gaussian curvature such that for any @xmath76 , there exists a borel measure @xmath77 such that @xmath78 and @xmath79 i.e. , the incidence theorem fails .",
    "here @xmath80 denotes the energy integral @xmath81 and the condition @xmath82 simply means that the measure @xmath77 is supported on a set of hausdorff dimension at least @xmath83 .",
    "we prove this proposition in section [ sec : countingtrianglesinconvexnorm ] .",
    "the main ingredient in the proof is some interesting number theory that arises when we count the number of equilateral triangles in this convex norm .",
    "we attempted to extend this result to tetrahedra but encounter a harder number theory problem . in section [ sec : countingtetrahedrainconvexnorm ] we set up the problem and pose the number theory problem that can resolve it .",
    "vector quantities will be denoted in boldface type , e.g. @xmath84 or @xmath85 .",
    "the notation @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 have the usual meaning , that there is a positive constant @xmath90 so that @xmath91 throughout the domain of @xmath92 .",
    "if the constant @xmath90 depends on any parameter , then this is indicated by a subscript , e.g. @xmath93 .",
    "the notation @xmath94 means that both @xmath87 and @xmath95 hold , that is , there are positive constants @xmath96 such that @xmath97 ( we can say that @xmath92 and @xmath98 have the same order ) .",
    "we use the following number theoretic lemma .    [ lemma : circleprob ] let @xmath99 be the number of ways to represent @xmath100 as a sum of @xmath64 squares . for @xmath101 and any @xmath102 , we have @xmath103    much stronger versions of this lemma exist in the literature .",
    "we however only need this weaker version which follows immediately from the classical bound @xmath104 .",
    "we consider the lattice construction , which is also considered in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this construction gives a subset @xmath2 of @xmath105 with @xmath106 .",
    "let @xmath107 and recursively choose @xmath108 with @xmath109 , for all @xmath110 .",

    "it follows by a proof similar to that of theorem 8.15 in @xcite that @xmath118 .",

    "note that up to translation , it suffices to place our first point , @xmath128 , at the origin .",
    "now suppose that the remaining @xmath3 vertices are @xmath129 , which are at distances @xmath130 from the origin .",
    "by lemma [ lemma : circleprob ] there are @xmath131 distinct lattice points at distance @xmath132 from the origin .",
    "so , there are @xmath133 @xmath3-simplices with lattice points at the distances @xmath130 from the origin .",
    "we then count the number of distinct sequences of distances @xmath134 that a simplex can have .",

    "the above is equivalent to @xmath141",
    "we proceed by generalizing the example of mattila presented in @xcite , which was introduced in @xcite , and generalized to triangles in the plane in @xcite . for @xmath142 ,",
    "let @xmath143 denote the standard @xmath30-dimensional cantor set contained in the interval @xmath144 $ ] .",
    "set @xmath145 , and let @xmath146 , where we give @xmath2 the product measure arising from the the @xmath30-dimensional hausdorff measure , @xmath147 , on @xmath148 . hence @xmath149 @xcite .",
    "now fix a point @xmath114 in @xmath2 , and pick out a @xmath3-simplex of @xmath2 containing @xmath114 so that each of the edges from @xmath114 of the simplex have length @xmath150 and they are all orthogonal at @xmath114",
    ". then we may fatten each of the nodes of the simplex besides @xmath114 to an @xmath151 box , where there are @xmath3 sides of length @xmath152 and @xmath153 sides of length @xmath154 .",
    "each of the points within these boxes form a @xmath4 simplex along with @xmath114 .",
    "further , each axis aligned box has measure @xmath155 thus the combined measure of each of the @xmath3 boxes we have selected is @xmath156 integrating over all possible values of @xmath114 , we see that is a lower bound for the left hand side of . in order for this bound to be a larger order of magnitude than @xmath157",
    ", we must have @xmath158 while simultaneously satisfying @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "hence for @xmath161 set @xmath162 equal to @xmath163 and for @xmath164 set @xmath162 equal to @xmath150 .",
    "then @xmath165 while the previous sum is equal to @xmath166 .",
    "to begin , we define a convex body , @xmath72 , which induces a norm on @xmath105 .",
    "let @xmath167    then @xmath168 , and define @xmath169 and the induced norm @xmath170 with unit ball @xmath72 .",
    "in other words , the point @xmath171 in @xmath105 is at unit distance from the origin if @xmath172 and either @xmath173 or @xmath174 , depending on whether @xmath84 lies on the upper or lower hemisphere of the unit paraboloid , respectively .",
    "hence the points @xmath175 and @xmath176 are at unit distance if @xmath177 lies on the unit paraboloid .",
    "now consider the lattice @xmath178    [ lem : valtrtri]the number of unit equilateral triangles @xmath179 with @xmath180 is @xmath181 for @xmath75 .",
    "it suffices to examine choices of points @xmath175 on @xmath182 and @xmath176 on @xmath183 .",
    "these points are of the form @xmath184 and are depicted in figure [ fig : balls ] .",
    "now we must ensure that @xmath177 is also of unit length hence we must have that @xmath185 and @xmath177 lies on either @xmath186 or @xmath187 .",
    "@xmath188    and so for this vector to lie on @xmath182 , the final component of this vector must satisfy : @xmath189 this yields a diophantine equation whose number of solutions we will bound below : @xmath190 where the @xmath191 are integers satisfying @xmath192 , @xmath193 , and @xmath185 .",

    "there are @xmath200 such pairs for sufficiently large @xmath201 , and we show that each such pair gives rise to a solution .",

    "further , by using the lower bound on @xmath220 to estimate the cross term we obtain that @xmath227    hence there are @xmath221 choices of @xmath211 that allow us to solve the equation with the three additional constraints .",
    "thus , as there are @xmath228 choices of @xmath229 $ ] for @xmath209 , there are @xmath181 solutions to the equation .",
    "we first count the total number of unit triangles in @xmath230 that have a point in @xmath231 . for each one of the @xmath232 points @xmath233 in @xmath234 ,",

    "so , we have @xmath235 total unit triangles in @xmath230 which include a point in @xmath231 .",
    "we now construct the measure @xmath77this construction is analogous to that in @xcite , except that we need to consider a larger configuration of points . to do this , partition space into lattice cubes of side length @xmath236 for some large integer @xmath201 and @xmath237 as this range is non - trivial .",
    "now set @xmath77 to be the lebesgue measure on those cubes containing a point of @xmath230 , our lattice , normalized by @xmath238 and furthermore restricted to lie in some large box , i.e. , @xmath239^d } \\chi_{r_\\epsilon(p)}(x)\\,dx,\\ ] ] where @xmath240 denotes the cube of side - length @xmath152 centered at @xmath241 .",
    "it then follows by lemma 2.1 in @xcite that @xmath242 and moreover that by normalizing we can take @xmath243 as well .",
    "we now have that @xmath244 as each triangle we counted in our point configuration contributes @xmath245 to the measure .",
    "therefore , the estimate fails for all @xmath246 , for every @xmath75 .",
    "in this section we give the natural generalization of the previous section s argument to counting tetrahedra in the valtr construction .",
    "we present a system of equations which governs the number of tetrahedra and present this number - theoretic problem as an open question .",

    "for example , we may insist that @xmath251 lie on @xmath183 , which implies that @xmath252 simplifying the above equation and performing similar computations for the other cases ( @xmath249 ) and ( @xmath250 ) we obtain two additional equations , which are of a different form as @xmath253 and @xmath247 lie on opposite hemispheres .",
