    "dwarf nova outbursts are understood to be the result of an instability in the rate of mass transfer through the accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf in these semidetached binaries .",
    "the instability can be triggered at large or small disk radii , resulting in normal , fast - rise outbursts or anomalous , slow - rise outbursts , respectively . in either case , the beginning of the outburst is signaled by a rise of the optical flux , followed by a rise of the uv flux as material sinks through the disk , converting gravitational potential energy into rotational kinetic energy and radiation .",
    "this is followed by a rise in the euv flux as material passes through the boundary layer between the disk and the surface of the white dwarf , where it converts its prodigious rotational kinetic energy into radiation .    because the optical and euv flux of dwarf novae is produced in physically distinct regions of the accretion disk , light curves in these wavebands provide important diagnostics of the nature of dwarf nova outbursts . toward this end , we present optical and euv light curves of dwarf novae observed by the _ extreme ultraviolet explorer _ ( _ euve _ ) satellite .",
    "during the past seven years , _ euve _ was used to observe four dwarf novae in outburst : ss  cyg in narrow and wide , normal and anomalous outbursts ; u  gem in normal outburst ( twice ) ; vw  hyi in normal and superoutburst ( twice ) ; and oy  car in superoutburst ( twice ) .",
    "these eleven observations were originally obtained for varying reasons , and on a couple of occasions they were coordinated with other satellites ( _ rxte _ , _ voyager _ , _ hst _ ) sensitive in other wavebands ( hard x - rays , fuv , uv ) . details of the _ euve _ observations are provided in table  1 .",
    "note that the exposures are 55274 ks , and because the satellite takes data for @xmath2 one third of its orbit , the euv light curves span intervals of 213 days .",

    "optical light curves of these outbursts were constructed from visual magnitude estimates and ccd photometric measurements obtained by members of the american association of variable star observers ( aavso ) and the variable star section / royal astronomical society of new zealand ( vss / rasnz ) .",
    "euv light curves were constructed from the _ euve _ deep survey photometer ( ds ) or short wavelength spectrometer ( sw ) in those instances when the ds was turned off ( during the peak of the 10/96 outburst of ss  cyg , both outbursts of u gem , and the 6/94 outburst of vw  hyi ) .",
    "the resulting optical and euv light curves are shown in figures 16 , with the _ euve _ ds and sw data shown by filled circles and squares , respectively , and the optical data shown by dots and open diamonds ( measurements ) or carets ( upper limits ) .",
    "half - day averages of the optical measurements are shown by the histograms for ss  cyg and u  gem . in figure  4 the _ voyager _",

    "the anomalous outbursts of ss  cyg ( fig .",
    "1 ) manifest the gradual increase of the optical and euv light curves expected for inside - out outbursts .",
    "the optical and euv flux rises during the beginning of these outbursts as the heating wave sweeps outward through the disk , causing more and more material to flow through the disk and boundary layer onto the white dwarf .",
    "in contrast , the normal outbursts of ss  cyg ( fig .",
    "2 ) , u  gem ( fig .",
    "3 ) , and vw  hyi ( fig .",
    "4 ) manifest the fast increase of , and the delay between , the optical and euv light curves expected for outside - in outbursts . as measured from the initial rise of the optical light curves , the delay of the rise of the euv light curves is @xmath3 , 1.25 , and 0.75 days for ss  cyg , u  gem , and vw  hyi , respectively . in vw  hyi ,",
    "the fuv light curve rises @xmath4 days after the optical light curve and @xmath5 days before the euv light curve , but falls as slowly as the optical light curve , consistent with the expectation that the accretion disk and not the boundary layer is the source of the fuv flux .",
    "we were not able to observe the rise of the euv light curves of the superoutbursts of vw  hyi ( fig .",
    "5 ) or oy  car ( fig .  6 ) , but during both observations of oy  car the euv light curve was observed to fall and then rise while the optical light curve was declining only slowly . this behavior is evidence for a decrease and subsequent increase of the mass - accretion rate onto the white dwarf , as might be expected if a normal outburst is rejuvenated by an increase in the mass - accretion rate driven by the tidal instability expected for such high mass - ratio binaries .    the observed optical - euv delays of the normal outbursts of ss  cyg , u  gem , and vw  hyi provide the most direct measurement of the velocity of the heating wave which transforms the disk from quiescence to outburst . assuming the system parameters shown in table  1 , that the radius of the disk is @xmath6 , and that the disk instability starts at the outer edge of the disk , the velocity of the heating wave @xmath7 .",
