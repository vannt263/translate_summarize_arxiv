    "indeed the ssp models are often built using such information from gcs .",
    "thus , in order to have any confidence in the results of applying ssp models to unresolved galaxies , it is necessary that the ssps correctly reproduce the properties of galactic gcs .",

    "previous studies of galactic gcs using lick indices ( puzia et al .",

    "the variations in abundance ratios severely complicate the process of deriving age and metallicity from the ssps models . in order to overcome these difficulties ,",

    "two commonly used balmer lines ( h@xmath7 and h@xmath13 ) are plotted against [ mgfe ] in fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] .",
    "such two dimensional index plots are commonly used to derive ages and metallicities ( e.g. bressan , chiosi & tantalo 1996 ; kuntschner & davies 1998 ; longhetti et al . 2000 ; kuntschner et al .",
    "2002 ; beasley , hoyle & sharples 2002 ) . however , inspection of fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] clearly identifies a number of concerns .",
    "firstly , in both h@xmath7 and h@xmath13 plots , a significant number of the gcs fall below the oldest ssps , suggesting ages significantly greater than the age of the universe .",
    "a second concern is that a number of gcs suggest young ( @xmath45  gyr ) ages , in conflict with the known age distribution of these galactic gcs ( salaris & weiss 2002 ; rosenberg et al .",
    "in addition , for many gcs , the ages suggested by the h@xmath7[mgfe ] grids differ from those suggested by the h@xmath13[mgfe ] grids .",
    "for example , ngc  6171 lies below the grids in h@xmath7 , suggesting an age @xmath1015  gyr , while in the h@xmath13 plots its position within the grid suggests an age @xmath95  gyr .",
    "the bulge also suggests a younger age in the h@xmath13[mgfe ] plots than in those of h@xmath7[mgfe ] . on the other hand , the high metallicity gcs , ngc  6528 and 6553 ( with [ mgfe]@xmath143.0   ) , suggest _ older _ ages in the h@xmath13[mgfe ] plots than in the h@xmath7[mgfe ] plots .",
    "therefore , the ages derived from fig . [ grids2 ] are sometimes highly dependent on the choice of balmer line , and are inconsistent with the known age distribution of these galactic gcs , regardless of which balmer line is used . consequently , we conclude that 2-dimensional index plots , such as those in fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] , are unreliable for the measurement of ages in globular clusters . in the following ,",
    "we outline a method that is robust with respect to such problems .",
    "the method of measuring the derived parameters for gcs used in this work is a @xmath1minimisation technique which involves fitting as many lick indices as possible .",
    "the justifications for this are :    * by fitting as many indices as possible the procedure makes maximum use of the available data .",
    "it should be noted that , while individual indices are degenerate with respect to the derived parameters ( age , metallicity and @xmath0element abundance ratios ) , most indices contain _ some _ information regarding each of these parameters . *",
    "the derived parameters are less prone to uncertainties in data reduction , e.g. flux calibration error , stray cosmic rays , skyline residuals , velocity dispersion error , errors in conversion to the lick system , etc . *",
    "the procedure is also particularly useful for spectra affected by specific modelling problems , such as horizontal branch morphologies not matching those modelled in the ssps .",
    "this is because the affected indices ( mainly h@xmath7 in the case of horizontal branch morphology problems ) can be identified and , if necessary , omitted from the fitting procedure with only a modest increase in overall error ( see proctor & sansom 2002 ; hereafter ps02 ) .",
    "indeed , using this technique , the derived parameters are less prone to modelling uncertainties in general .      in this work we use ssp models to derive estimates of age , [ fe / h ] and the abundance ratio of a number of key ,",
    "mainly @xmath0 , elements ( parameterised by [ e / fe ]  see ps02 ) .",
    "tmb03 models include ssps of solar abundance ratio ( i.e. [ e / fe ]  =  0.0 ) as well as [ e / fe ]  =  0.3 , + 0.3 , + 0.5 .",
    "these models were constructed using the results of tripicco & bell ( 1995 ; hereafter tb95 ) by the method first outlined in trager et al .",
    "( 2000 ; hereafter t00 ) .",
    "v99 and bc03 ssp models , on the other hand , have abundance ratios that vary with metallicity , as their models reflect the abundance ratios of the stellar calibrators used to construct the models .",
    "we have calculated indices for v99 and bc03 ssp models for abundance ratios [ e / fe]=0.3,+0.3 and + 0.6 , using the results of tb95 .",
    "two methods were considered .",
    "the first , ( the t00 method ) , is best suited to low metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath90.0 ) populations .",
    "the second , described in ps02 ( the ` fe method ' ) , is better suited to high metallicity populations ( [ fe / h]@xmath150.0 ) .",
    "both of these methods are based on the assumption of a fixed fractional contribution to the total luminosity of each the three stellar types modelled by tb95 .    the fractional change in index values for a change of + 0.3  dex in [ e / fe ]",
    "are listed in table [ fracts ] for both methods .",
    "tb95 did not model h@xmath16 and h@xmath17 indices , so these indices are assumed to be unaffected by changes in abundance ratios and h@xmath17 indices to abundance ratios .",
    "however , they find that ; _ ``  the sensitivity of h@xmath17 and h@xmath16 to @xmath0/fe disappears at low metallicity and is relatively small around solar metallicity  ' ' _ . ] .",
    "it is important to note that the two methods assume different chemical compositions , with the t00 method assuming a fixed [ z / h ] ( overall metallicity ) as [ e / fe ] changes , while the ps02 method assumes fixed [ fe / h ] .",
    "unless otherwise stated , the derived parameters from these ssp models quoted in this work were derived using the t00 method .",

    "for the tmb03 ssp models , fits were obtained to both the rhb and bhb models .",

    "it is clear from this figure that a number of indices are poorly fit by all three sets of ssp models .",
    "the poorest fits were obtained for the cn indices and nad .",
    "the nad index is known to be severely affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "this index was therefore excluded from the fitting procedure . on the other hand ,",
    "the cn indices , which were also found to be enhanced by trager ( 2004 ) , are extremely sensitive to nitrogen abundance ( tb95 ) which is known to be higher in galactic gcs than in field and halo stars ( e.g. li & burstein 2003 ) .",
    "the large positive residuals present in the fits to gcs ( but not evident in the fit to the p02 bulge data ) is therefore consistent with an [ n / fe ]  @xmath10  0 in gcs .",
    "indeed , tmb03 showed that ssp models in which n is independently enhanced with respect to other light elements can provide excellent fits to these indices .",
    "the fitting procedure has therefore successfully identified this abundance anomaly . rather than introduce n abundance as another free parameter in our modelling",
    ", the cn indices were excluded from the fitting procedure in the following .",
    "as the cn and nad indices were removed form the fitting procedure , the fits of other indices ( particularly the enhancement sensitive indices  c@xmath114668 , mg@xmath19 , mg@xmath11 and mgb ) are generally improved ( see fig .",
    "[ chiplot ] ) .",
    "however for two indices ( fe5015 and ca4227 ) this was not the case .",
    "for fe5015 we recall that this index showed a large variation between the two samples for the four gcs in common to p02 and cbr98 . the positive deviation in fig .",
    "[ chiplot ] is consistent with the assumption that p02 overestimate the fe5015 index values . in this case",
    "the fitting procedure therefore appears to have identified a problem in calibration to the lick system .",
    "consequently , fe5015 was excluded from the fitting procedure .",
    "the ca4227 index was also shown by tb95 to be sensitive to nitrogen abundance ( with increased n abundance resulting in a reduction in the ca4227 line  strength ) .",
    "its negative deviation in fig .",
    "[ chiplot ] is therefore consistent with the nitrogen overabundance in gcs .",
    "however , ca4455 also shows a negative deviation .",
    "this weakness in the calcium lines has previously been observed in gcs ( e.g. maraston et al .",
    "2003 ) and galaxies ( e.g. worthey 1992 ; vazdekis et al . 1997 ; trager et al . 1998 ; ps02 ) , as well as in the near - infrared cat index ( e.g. saglia et al .",
    "it is therefore unlikely to be a result of problems in calibration to the lick system .",
    "in addition , since tb95 showed ca4455 to be insensitive to calcium abundance , it is unlikely that this is the effect of a variation in [ ca / fe ] .",
    "finally , we note that the indices either side of ca4455 , particularly fe4383 and fe4531 , also possess consistently negative deviations , suggesting that there is some systematic discrepancy between models and observations at these wavelengths .",
    "we therefore conclude that the poor fit of ca4455 is most likely the result of problems in the modelling of this index in ssp models .    despite its relatively large deviations in fig .",
    "[ chiplot ] , exclusion of ca4455 had negligible impact on the results of the fitting procedure , with 85% of the fits finding _ exactly _ the same best fit , while the remaining 15% differed by at most 2 grid steps ( amounting to @xmath200.05  dex in any derived parameter ) . to be consistent with our aim of fitting as many indices as possible",
    "we therefore decided to include this index in the fitting procedure .",
    "having considered the average and rms deviations to the best fits , we turn our attention to the deviations of indices in individual gcs .",
    "for the most part , no single index dominated the deviations in any given gc .",
    "the main exception to this being h@xmath7 in seven gcs fitted using either v99 or bc03 ssp models , as well as the tmb03 rhb models .",
    "for the three of these aberrant gcs in the p02 data , caii values are all below 1.15 , indicating that these are all either bhb or ihb gcs .",
    "the decision was therefore taken to exclude h@xmath7 from all gcs in the p02 sample with caii below this value , i.e. in all the bhb and ihb gcs .",
    "for the four remaining cbr98 gcs with deviations dominated by h@xmath7 deviations , the index was also omitted from the fitting procedure .",
    "it is worth noting that these four gcs are also those in the cbr98 data with hbr values @xmath100.9 and therefore constitute all the bhb and ihb gcs in the cbr98 sample .",
    "the decision to exclude certain h@xmath7 values is supported by the finding of ps02 that the exclusion of balmer lines from the fitting procedure has relatively little impact on the derived parameters , as long as a sufficiently large number of indices are included in the fitting procedure .",
    "the results from tmb03 ssp models are taken to be those from the rhb fits in gcs with hbr=1.0 , and for bhb fits for gcs with hbr@xmath101.0 ( i.e. ihb and bhb gcs ) .",

    "the best fits of the p02 data to all three ssp model sets exhibited average reduced@xmath1 values of @xmath43.5 .",

    "indeed , the typical reduced@xmath1 values for our fits to cbr98 data ( for which the rms scatter in the comparison of 4 gcs common to both p02 and cbr98 was used as the error ) were @xmath41.5 , suggesting that both effects noted above are present .",
    "however , whatever the case , our use of a large number of indices in the fitting procedure ameliorates the effects of such problems on the estimates of derived parameters .",
    "it is also worth noting that , since the reduced @xmath1 of the best fits were significantly greater than 1.0 , results for lower signal - to - noise spectra can be expected to be similar . however , from previous experience ( e.g. proctor et al .",
    "2004 ) , we find that a minimum signal - to - noise of 20 @xmath21 is required for the technique to obtain robust results .    in order to test the robustness of the fitting procedure , fits were obtained for each of the gcs with only eight indices included in the fitting procedure ( we recall that between eight and 20 indices were included in the final fits above , with the majority of gcs fit by 16 or more indices ) .",
    "the eight indices included in these fits were h@xmath7 , mg@xmath19 , mg@xmath11 , mgb , fe5270 , fe5335 fe5406 and fe5709",
    ". the rms difference between the derived parameters from these fits and those from the final fits above were 0.103  dex , 0.144  dex and 0.087  dex in log(age ) , [ fe / h ] and [ e / fe ] respectively .    in summary ,",
    "the @xmath1minimisation technique has allowed us to identify problems with nad ( probably caused by interstellar absorption ) , the known nitrogen abundance anomaly affecting cn@xmath19 , cn@xmath11 and ( possibly ) ca4227 , problems in calibration to the lick system ( fe5015 in the p02 data and tio indices in cbr98 ) , as well as individual indices suffering unexplained reduction errors .",
    "this technique therefore holds a great deal of promise in the investigation of integrated stellar populations such as extra - galactic globular cluster systems .",
    "in this section we review the derived parameters ( age , [ fe / h ] , [ z / h ] and [ e / fe ] ) obtained from the fitting procedures described in the previous section . these are denoted with the subscript ssp .",
    "the results are compared to those obtained by other techniques ( such as fitting to the h@xmath7[mgfe ] and h@xmath13[mgfe ] grids shown in fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] ) and to values from the literature .",
    "we wish to emphasise that the values of the derived parameters were not considered in the fitting procedure outlined in the previous section , i.e. the ` best ' fits were arrived at without considering the derived parameters that they generate .",
    "errors in the derived parameters were estimated using monte ",
    "carlo type realisations of the best fit ssp models perturbed by the index error estimates .",
    "however , this method produces errors in the derived parameters based purely on the estimates of observational error , they do not include any allowance for modelling errors .",
    "we estimate more realistic errors in section [ discussion ] .",
    "six gcs ( ngc  6121 , 6205 , 6218 , 6341 , 6626 and 6981 ) were found to possess [ fe / h]@xmath22 below the minimum modelled by v99 .",
    "these gcs have therefore been omitted from presentations of v99 results .",
    "ngc  6341 also fell below the minimum [ fe / h]@xmath22 in bc03 and tmb03 ssp models .",
    "this gc has therefore been omitted from presentations of bc03 and tmb03 results .      before discussing the results of the age determinations as a whole , it is first necessary to consider the method employed in the fitting of the high metallicity gcs ngc  6528 and ngc  6553 , as these possess metallicities close to solar , i.e. in the range affected by the changing sensitivity of isochrones to non  solar abundance ratios ( see ps02 ) .",
    "it was shown in ps02 and thomas & maraston ( 2003 ) that the main effect of this on the values of derived parameters is in age .",
    "we confirm this finding using the gc data of both p02 and cbr98 , as values of [ fe / h]@xmath22 and [ e / fe]@xmath22 are consistent between the t00 and ps02 methods@xmath40.0  dex . ]",
    "( within errors ) for both gcs in both studies .",
    "values of age , on the other hand , show significant differences .",
    "the average age and rms value ( from both gcs compared to three sets of ssp models ) using the ps02 method is 10.3@xmath231.5  gyr , while values derived by the t00 method were 7.8@xmath233.3  gyr with one value as low as 4  gyr .",
    "for the bulge , the ps02 method finds ages of 6.0@xmath230.8  gyr while the t00 method gives 3.8@xmath230.4  gyr .",
    "the ps02 method therefore produces age estimates that are higher than those derived by the t00 method ( as noted in ps02 and thomas & maraston 2003 ) , and more consistent with the known old - ages of gcs ( salaris & weiss 2002 ; rosenberg et al .",
    "1999 ) and the bulge ( e.g. rich 1999 ) .",
    "we have therefore elected to use the derived values obtained by the ps02 method for ngc  6528 , 6553 and the bulge in the following analysis .",
    "for the four gcs common to the p02 and cbr98 studies ( ngc  6356 , 6528 , 6553 and 6624 ) we find an average age offset of only 0.02  gyr and an rms scatter of 1.7  gyr about a one  to ",
    "one relation , although we note that the two studies are not fully independent , as the cbr98 data were calibrated to the lick system using a comparison to the p02 data ( section [ data ] ) .",
    "ages measured from the ssp models for 10 gcs are compared with published ages derived from colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) in fig .",
    "[ age_meth ] .",
    "cmd - based values are taken from salaris & weiss ( 2002 ) for ngc  6121 , 6171 , 6205 , 6218 , 6356 , 6624 , 6637 and 6838 .",
    "for ngc  6528 and 6553 we use the bruzual et al .",
    "( 1997 ) result that these gcs are @xmath42  gyr younger than 47 tuc , which is given as 10.7  gyr old in salaris & weiss .",
    "we therefore assume an age of 8.7  gyr for ngc  6528 and ngc  6553 .    fig .",
    "[ age_meth ] shows gc ages derived in three ways .",
    "the top plots show ages derived by interpolation of the h@xmath7[mgfe ] grids ( fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] ) . the tendency for gcs to fall below the grids in fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] is reflected by arrows indicating ages greater than or equal to that modelled . the extremely young ages ( 35  gyr ) suggested for some gcs ( primarily ihb and bhb gcs ) is also evident .",
    "indeed , there is generally poor agreement with ages derived from cmds .",
    "the middle plots show ages estimated by interpolation of the h@xmath13[mgfe ] grids ( fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] ) . again , a large scatter in ages , and poor agreement with ages derived from cmds are found .",
    "the inconsistency of age estimates derived from comparison to the h@xmath7[mgfe ] and h@xmath13[mgfe ] grids , noted in section [ models ] , is evident , particularly for ngc6171 , as well as ngc  6528 and 6553 ( both with age@xmath2410  gyr ) .",
    "this emphasises the need for a method of age measurement that is robust to both observational errors _ and _ modelling deficiencies .    in the bottom plots the results of our @xmath1minimisation technique",
    "are shown . in this case , no gcs are found to possess ages less than 8  gyr , including ihb and bhb gcs which exhibit old ages .",
    "in addition , and despite the narrow age range suggested by cmd values , we find correlations between log(age)@xmath22 and log(age)@xmath25 at 95% , 95% and 90% confidence levels for v99 , bc03 and tmb03 ssp models respectively ( the correlation in tmb03 results are adversely affected by the relatively low upper age limit of the models ) .",
    "the @xmath1minimisation technique therefore produces age estimates that are in reasonable agreement with values derived from cmds in both absolute and relative terms .",
    "we therefore conclude that this technique is superior to the method of deriving ages from 2-dimensional index plots such as fig .",
    "[ grids2 ] and is , consequently , well suited to the estimation of ages in extra - galactic gc systems .      in this section",
    "we compare the metallicities derived from ssp models ( [ fe / h]@xmath22 and [ z / h]@xmath22 ) with values published in the literature .    for the four gcs common to the p02 and cbr98 studies ( ngc  6356",

    "given the good agreement between studies average values are presented in the following .",
    "in their analysis of p02 data , tmb03 found a good correlation between [ z / h ] and the [ fe / h ] values of harris ( 1996 ) .",
    "a comparison of our [ fe / h]@xmath22 and [ z / h]@xmath22 measures , from v99 , bc03 and tmb03 ssp models , to the values of [ fe / h ] of harris ( 1996 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ harris ] . the same good agreement between [ z / h]@xmath22 and the [ fe / h ] values of harris ( 1996 ) is found for all three sets of ssp models , with rms variations about a one - to - one lines @xmath200.2",
    "dex . however , we note that beasley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) find good agreement between [ fe / h ] derived from ssp models and values from cmds for gcs in the large magellanic cloud .",
    "we therefore simply conclude that the methods used in this work ( and tmb03 ) are well suited to the study of metallicities in extra - galactic gc systems , as they produce excellent measures of _ relative _ metallicities .",
    "they also successfully recover the actual [ fe / h ] value assigned to the isochrone that best fits the observed population  _",
    "if _ we assume that [ z / h]@xmath22 reflects the [ fe / h ] of the isochrone .",
    "however , this result suggests that there are still some problems in the calibration of either the p02 indices ( which we used to calibrate the cbr98 indices to the lick system ) or the metallicity scale in ssp models .      in this section we compare the values of [ e / fe]@xmath22 , derived by the @xmath1minimisation technique , with values of enhancements in @xmath0elements published in the literature .",
    "it is important to bear in mind that , for v99 and bc03 ssp models , the values of [ e / fe ] output from the fitting procedure are enhancements _ relative to that of the best fit ssp models _",
    "( see ps02 , tmb03 and proctor et al .",
    "2004 for more complete discussions ) . consequently , since the ssp models are constructed using stars in the solar neighbourhood , account must be taken of the pattern of enhancements in local stars ( see section [ nsar ] ) . tmb03 have adjusted their indices for the [ e / fe ] inherent to local stars such that [ e / fe ] is quoted with respect to solar at all metallicities .",
    "the tmb03 ssp models therefore require no further correction .",
    "however , for v99 and bc03 the output values of [ e / fe]@xmath22 need to be corrected for this effect . in this work",
    "we assume a pattern in local abundance ratios ( and hence in the ssp models ) similar to that assumed by tmb03 .",
    "the [ e / fe ] of the ssp models is assumed to rise from 0.0  dex at [ fe / h]@xmath22=0.0  dex to [ e / fe]=+0.25  dex at [ fe / h]@xmath22=1.0  dex and to remain at this values for all [ fe / h]@xmath261.0  dex ( e.g. edvardsson et al . 1993 ; gustafsson et al . 1999 ; bensby , feltzing & lundstrm 2003 ) .    a comparison of @xmath0enhancements from the literature to [ e / fe]@xmath22 for five gcs ( ngc  6121 , 6205 and 6838 from carney 1996 , ngc  6528 from carretta et al . 2001 and ngc   6553 from cohen et al .",
    "1999 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ pub_enh ] . for the sake of consistency with carney ( 1996 )",
    ", we use the average of the si , ca and ti abundances to calculate @xmath0element enhancements from the latter two studies . the agreement between [ e / fe]@xmath22 and the published value of [ si , ca , ti / fe ] for these five gcs is good .",
    "we therefore conclude that the @xmath1minimisation technique provides an excellent technique for estimating abundance ratios in extra - galactic gc systems .",
    "given that our aim is to define a procedure for measuring the derived parameters of extra - galactic gcs , it is clearly useful to ask : what conclusions would we have drawn from the data as a whole had it been an extra - galactic gc system ?",
    "can this technique help us in the investigation of such systems ? to this end , the results of our determinations of the derived parameters for the 19 gcs studied are plotted in fig .",
    "[ agez ] .",
    "first , we note that the fitting procedure outlined in section [ fitting_proc ] identified the known abundance anomaly affecting cn indices ( assumed to be the result of nitrogen abundance enhancement ) .",
    "the capability of the technique to highlight such abundance variations could clearly provide useful insights into extra - galactic gc systems .",
    "with regard to age estimates , it was shown that the @xmath1minimisation technique provides values that are in good agreement with cmd derived ages in both an absolute and relative sense .",
    "the average values of age ( @xmath23 the rms scatter ) were found to be 13.1@xmath232.3 , 12.2@xmath233.3 and 12.7@xmath231.9  gyr for v99 , bc03 and tmb03 respectively .",
    "therefore , all three ssp models used indicate an _ old _ population of gcs . given that at least some of the scatter about these averages is the result of real variations in gc age , the rms scatters about the average values of age indicate that we can safely assume an upper limit of 0.1  dex on errors in individual log(age ) estimates .",
    "such a value is also consistent with the rms deviations found in the test of robustness detailed in section [ fitting_proc ] .",
    "the metallicity determinations for all three ssp models show a broad range of sub - solar metallicities , which are in good agreement with the literature values ( see section [ met ] ) .",
    "the scatter about the one - to - one relations in the top plots of fig .",
    "[ harris ] indicate that we can safely assume an upper limit of @xmath230.1  dex on errors in individual [ fe / h ] and [ z / h ] estimates .",
    "this value is again consistent with the rms deviations found in the test of robustness detailed in section [ fitting_proc ] .",
    "the [ e / fe]@xmath22 estimates for the five gcs with literature values for @xmath0-enhancements are in good agreement with the literature values ( section [ enhest ] ) , again in both an absolute and relative sense .",
    "the average and rms values of [ e / fe]@xmath22 for the sample are 0.35@xmath230.09 , 0.25@xmath230.10 and 0.32@xmath230.09  dex for v99 , bc03 and tmb03 respectively .",
    "we can again use the rms values to set an upper limit on the errors in [ e / fe]@xmath22 of @xmath230.1  dex , which is again consistent with the rms deviations found in the test of robustness detailed in section [ fitting_proc ] .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "[ agez ] suggests that values of [ e / fe]@xmath22 in gcs are slightly higher than that of the local stars used to populate the ssps _",
    "at all metallicities_. the additional enhancement in @xmath0elements , relative to that of the stellar calibrators , is 0.14 , 0.05 and 0.11  dex in v99 , bc03 and tmb03 ssp models respectively .",
    "it should be noted that these [ e / fe ] excesses are independent of the assumed [ e / fe ] pattern in the stellar calibrators , as the fitting technique outputs the [ e / fe ] _ relative _ to the models .",
    "while an enhancement with respect to the stellar calibrators is perhaps to be expected at high metallicities ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath10  1 ) , where the ssp models are based largely on thin disc stars , the effect persists to the low metallicities at which the models are constructed largely using thick disc and halo stars .",
    "this is a slightly surprising result that clearly requires confirmation .",
    "the stellar bulge data appear to indicate a relatively young age ( 6.3@xmath233.6 ) .",
    "however , the p02 bulge data are highly susceptible to stochastic fluctuations in the stellar contents of the fields from which the spectra are constructed . given this , and the large error on the age estimate , no conclusion is drawn here regarding the age of the bulge . on the other hand , the average [ fe / h]@xmath22 of -0.37  dex and [ z / h]@xmath22 of -0.09  dex found for the bulge are consistent with the known distribution of bulge star metallicities ( ferreras , wyse & silk 2003 ) , while the [ e / fe]@xmath22 of 0.29  dex is consistent with the @xmath0element enhancements from high resolution studies ( e.g. mcwilliam & rich 2004 )",
    ". therefore , while no firm conclusion is reached with respect to age , the @xmath1minimisation technique produces metallicity and abundance ratio estimates for the bulge which are in good agreement with literature values .    in summary , we find that the values of age , [ fe / h ] and [ e / fe ] derived using the @xmath1minimisation technique are therefore in good agreement with values published in the literature and reproduce many of the known properties of galactic gcs and the bulge . using the data of p02 and cbr98 , upper limits on statistical errors in log(age ) , [ fe / h ] and [ e / fe ] have been shown to be @xmath230.1  dex .",
    "derived parameters with such errors could clearly provide powerful insights into the chemical and formation histories of extra - galactic gc systems and their host galaxies .",
    "we have compared the lick index data of puzia et al .",
    "( 2002 ) and cohen et al . (",
    "1998 ) for 20 galactic gcs to the ssp models of vazdekis ( 1999 ) , bruzual & charlot ( 2003 ) and thomas , maraston & bender ( 2003 ) .",
    "we showed that ages derived from 2dimensional index plots , such as h@xmath7[mgfe ] , are not reliable for these data .",
    "an alternative approach of using a @xmath1minimisation technique was outlined .",
    "this technique allowed the identification of the known nitrogen over - abundance in galactic gcs , as well as interstellar absorption in nad and poorly calibrated indices .",
    "it was shown that this technique successfully recovers the known age , metallicity and abundance ratio properties of the galactic gc population , reproducing values from the literature with an accuracy of @xmath40.1  dex in any parameter . however , even after poorly modelled indices were omitted from the @xmath1minimisation procedure , the fits to the models still exhibited reduced@xmath1 values significantly in excess of 1.0 for all gcs in both studies .",
    "this implies that ssp modelling uncertainties are significant , and emphasises the advantages of using a large number of indices in measuring derived parameters .",

    "<S> we define a method for analysis of the integrated spectra of extra - galactic globular clusters that provides more reliable measures of age , metallicity and @xmath0-element abundance ratio than have so far been achieved . </S>",
    "<S> the method involves the simultaneous fitting of up to 25 lick indices in a @xmath1-fitting technique that maximises the use of the available data . </S>",
    "<S> here we compare three sets of single stellar population ( ssp ) models of lick indices to the high signal - to - noise , integrated spectra of 20 galactic globular clusters . </S>",
    "<S> the ages , [ fe / h ] and @xmath0-element abundance ratios derived from the ssp models are compared to the results of resolved stellar population studies from the literature . </S>",
    "<S> we find good consistency with the published values , with an agreement of better than 0.1  dex in all three derived parameters . </S>",
    "<S> the technique allows identification of abundance ratio anomalies , such as the known nitrogen over - abundance in galactic globular clusters , and the presence of anomalous horizontal - branch morphologies . </S>",
    "<S> it also minimises the impact on the derived parameters of imperfect calibration to the lick system , and reduction errors in general . </S>",
    "<S> the method defined in this work is therefore robust with respect to many of the difficulties that plague the application of ssp models in general , and is , consequently , well suited to the study of extra - galactic globular cluster systems .    -0.5 </S>",
