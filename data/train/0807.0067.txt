    "quantum states have been stored and recalled using this approach @xcite .",
    "three level schemes are particularly well suited to gaseous atomic systems where significant optical depths can be obtained for the optical transitions due the allowed transitions and long coherence times can be obtained for the ground state coherences .",
    "rare earth ion doped solids at cryogenic temperatures have much higher atom densities and allow reasonable optical thickness to be obtained from ensembles of weak oscillators .",
    "these weak oscillators can have correspondingly long coherence times .",
    "this means that approaches involving only two level atoms can be considered .",

    "@xcite showed that in principle 54% efficiency can be achieved from a controlled reversible inhomogeneous broadening ( crib ) echo @xcite with two level atoms , in the case where the broadening mechanism is ` transverse ' , that is not correlated with position along the optical path .",
    "the efficiency was limited by reabsorbtion , as the sample is made more optically thick , which is required to absorb the input pulse , more of the echo gets absorbed before it can make it out of the sample .",
    "shortly afterward it was shown that the optical gradient echo or `` longitudinal '' crib echo @xcite , the only crib echo that has so far been reported experimentally , did not suffer from reabsorbtion problems and offered noise free , potentially 100% efficient storage @xcite .",
    "an attractive property of these echo based techniques is that time bandwidth product scales better with optical depth @xcite .",
    "indeed storing and recalling multiple pulses has been demonstrated for crib echo memories @xcite but this has proved difficult for eit .    following on from @xcite here we present analytic theory of the optical gradient echo or `` longitudinal crib '' echo .",
    "analytic solutions of the maxwell - bloch equations are derived for a pulse of light interacting with ensemble of atoms , where the resonant frequency atoms varies linearly with the propagation distance .",
    "after the input pulse atomic coherence dephases due to the different resonant frequencies of the atomic ensemble .",
    "if the detunings of each of the atoms are reversed the ensemble rephases and produces an echo . in the case where the medium is optically thick the echo is totally efficient .",
    "indeed , we show very close analogy between a gradient echo memory and a pair of beamsplitters .",
    "we use this analogy to calculate the efficiency of the longitudinal echo for optically thin samples .",
    "multiple switching and a number of memories operated in series can also be easily treated using this beamsplitter analogy . as transverse broadening can be considered as the limit of many stacked optically think transverse broadening .",
    "transverse broadening can be treated using the same approach .",
    "we reproduce previous results for the efficiency of transverse crib echoes @xcite and extend to the case of multiple switching .",
    "we consider the interaction of a collection of two - level atoms with a light field where a detuning of the atoms that is linearly dependent on their position can be introduced .",
    "we shall assume that the area of the incoming pulses is much less than that of a @xmath0 pulse .",
    "this enables us to treat the atoms as harmonic oscillators . before the detuning of the ions",
    "are flipped , the maxwell - bloch equations in the frame at the speed of light are @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 represents the slowly varying envelope of the optical field ; @xmath3 the polarization of the atoms ; @xmath4 the atomic density ; @xmath5 the atomic transition coupling strength ; @xmath6 the decay rate from the excited state and @xmath7 the detuning from resonance .",
    "we shall assume that the process happens fast compared to the atomic decay rate and will take @xmath8 .",
    "after the detuning of the ions is flipped to recall the light pulse the maxwell - bloch equations describing the dynamics are the same as above except the sign of the @xmath9 term in [ eq : mb1 ] is flipped leading to ( with @xmath8 )    @xmath10    as mentioned above , although the treatment here is classical , the linearity of eqs .",

    "this will be a modest phase shift in most situations where the memory might be used . a value for @xmath42 of 2 would provide sufficient optical depth for 99.999% efficiency , with this and 2 for @xmath71",
