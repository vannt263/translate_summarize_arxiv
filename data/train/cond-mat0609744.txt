    "ever since the discovery of high - t@xmath2 superconductors @xcite , many workers have attempted to develop practical applications for them .",
    "one potential electronic application is as a microstrip resonator .",
    "such a device has been developed by willemsen _",
    "@xcite , using a high - t@xmath0 cuprate material .",
    "even though these devices do not work at very high current densities , they are subject to strong nonlinear effects which mix together microwaves of different frequencies . this mixing , known as intermodulation ,",
    "was studied experimentally and theoretically by willemsen _",
    "@xcite ; theoretical models to explain their measurements were developed by dahm and scalapino @xcite .    in the model of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , the intermodulation is described in terms of an intermodulation current density @xmath1 , which depends on both temperature and the angle between the direction of current flow and the crystal axes .",
    "an equivalent quantity was also considered by yip and sauls @xcite for a @xmath3-wave superconductor . because of low - lying quasiparticles",
    ", they found that @xmath1 was much smaller than for a corresponding @xmath4-wave superconductor and also that it depended on the angle between the in - plane current density and the @xmath5-vector of the gap nodes .",
    "several other workers have also studied this intermodulation and the harmonic generation due to nonlinear effects @xcite .    in all this work ,",
    "the high - t@xmath0 cuprate superconductor was assumed to be _ homogeneous _  that is , the cuo@xmath6 layer properties were assumed independent of position within the layer .",
    "however , recent experimental work has invalidated this picture .",
    "specifically , in optimally oxygen - doped @xcite , underdoped , and slightly overdoped @xcite bi@xmath7sr@xmath7cacu@xmath7o@xmath8 ( usually called bscco-2212 ) , the superconducting energy gap was found to be _ spatially varying_. this result was obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy ( stm / s ) images of the superconducting layers .",
    "the differential tunneling conductance spectra of the sample were measured and the position - dependent gap @xmath9 was inferred from measurements of the energy difference between two coherence peaks in the spectra above and below the fermi level . in the underdoped sample ,",
    "the gap was found to map into two distinct regions .",
    "one ( called the @xmath10 domains ) had a gap @xmath11 ; the other ( denoted the @xmath12 domains ) had @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath10-domains were identified as superconducting , because they showed coherence peaks in the tunneling spectra .",
    "the @xmath12-regions were found to be non - superconducting , and were identified as a pseudogap phase @xcite , with a large gap .",
    "it was concluded that the spatially varying superconducting energy gaps do not arise from impurities , but are instead intrinsic properties of the material .",
    "thus , underdoped bscco-2212 is an intrinsically granular superconductor .    in this paper , we consider how this inhomogeneity affects the intermodulation in a high - t@xmath0 superconductor , such as bscco-2212 .",
    "as implied above , this intermodulation coefficient is actually a nonlinear transport coefficient .",
    "in fact , this coefficient describes the current - dependence of the superfluid density in the superconductor .",
    "this current - dependence is particularly strong in the @xmath3-wave high - t@xmath0 materials , because quasiparticles are excited even at very low applied currents .",
    "we will show that @xmath1 is formally analogous to another coefficient , well known in the study of nonlinear dielectrics . using this connection",
    ", we will demonstrate that @xmath1 is very sensitive to the detailed geometry of the superconducting inhomogeneity .",
    "we will consider only two - dimensional ( 2d ) systems , and only very low frequencies .",
    "this regime is appropriate to the cuprate superconductors , where superconductivity is believed to occur within cuo@xmath7 planes .",
    "our low - frequency approach should be applicable so long as the length scale of the inhomogeneity is much smaller than the wavelength of the applied microwave fields , a condition easily satisfied at microwave frequencies .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : level2 ] , we present the formalism for calculating the enhancement of @xmath1 in an inhomogeneous 2d superconductor . in section",
    "[ sec : level3 ] , we give several analytical results for the relevant enhancements and for @xmath1 , based on the analogy to a nonlinear dielectric composite .",
    "section [ sec : level4 ] presents a concluding discussion .",
    "we begin by expressing @xmath1 in terms of coefficients of the ginzburg - landau free energy density @xmath14 . in the absence of a vector potential @xmath15",
    ", @xmath14 takes the standard form @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 are appropriate constants , and @xmath20 is the complex position - dependent ginzburg - landau wave function . for the present problem , we will eventually assume that all three constants are functions of position .",
    "we also write @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is a quantity with dimensions of mass .",
    "the local supercurrent density takes the usual quantum - mechanical form @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 is the charge of a cooper pair and ` @xmath25 ' denotes a complex conjugate .",

    "this quantity is positive if @xmath32 .",
    "if there is a finite phase gradient , @xmath14 takes the form @xmath33 minimizing with respect to the modulus of the wave function at fixed @xmath34 , we find that @xmath35}{b}.   \\label{eq : psi1}\\ ] ] the corresponding current density takes the form @xmath36 .",

    "however , there is an extra term in the free energy density ; so eq .  ( [ eq : psi1 ] ) , and hence eq .",

    "nevertheless , we shall assume that the most important effects of inhomogeneity can be included by writing @xmath40 with appropriate coefficients @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",

    "the result is @xmath75 and @xmath76 here , @xmath77 is the single - particle density of states at the fermi energy ( measured in states per unit energy per unit volume ) , and @xmath78 is a temperature - independent coherence length .",
    "the penetration depth is then found to be determined by the equation @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the equilibrium value of the energy gap , given by the equation @xmath81    now according to experiments @xcite , in the small gap regions , bscco-2212 has a sizable superfluid density , whereas in the large - gap regions , the superfluid density is small or zero .",
    "if we interpret @xmath82 as proportional to the local superfluid density , then this experimental result implies that @xmath82 should vary _ inversely _ with @xmath80 . in order for this to be consistent with eq .",

    "it does suggest how @xmath1 is influenced by the inhomogeneity of the high - t@xmath0 layer .",
    "we now apply the above results to calculate @xmath1 for several models of inhomogeneous superconducting layers . in all cases ,",
    "we attempt to choose the layer properties to resemble those reported in experiments on bscco-2212 .",
    "our goal is to solve eq .",
    "( [ eq : j2 ] ) for @xmath86 and @xmath87 for some prescribed inhomogeneous superconductor .",
    "we assume that @xmath88 and @xmath89 are specified , but random .",
    "the present problem is _ formally _ equivalent to a randomly inhomogeneous dielectric with a cubic nonlinearity @xcite . in the latter problem , the electric field @xmath90 and electric displacement @xmath91",
    "are related by @xmath92 for the intermodulation problem , the analogous equations are eq .",

    "thus , we are again connecting a divergence - free field to a curl - free field . to treat the intermodulation problem ,",
    "therefore , we can use all the formal results previously derived for an inhomogeneous nonlinear dielectric , which we now briefly review .",
    "for a material described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : dielec ] ) , two useful coefficients are the _ effective linear dielectric function _ @xmath98 and the _ effective cubic nonlinear susceptibility _ @xmath99 .",
    "these quantities are defined in terms of the space - averaged electric field @xmath100 and displacement @xmath101 by latexmath:[\\[\\langle { \\bf d}\\rangle = \\epsilon_e \\langle { \\bf e}\\rangle + \\chi_e    ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath99 can be expressed as an average over the fourth power of the electric field in the associated _ linear _ composite .",
    "that is , if @xmath103 is the electric field in a composite described by the linear relation @xmath104 , then @xmath99 is given by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the applied electric field . if the composite medium has @xmath107 components , the @xmath108th of which has nonlinear susceptibility @xmath109 , then eq .",

    "thus , @xmath112 describes how much the fourth power of the electric field is enhanced in the @xmath108th component in the linear limit .",
    "the moments @xmath112 are difficult to compute exactly , except in a few very simple geometries .",
    "we have therefore chosen to make a decoupling approximation @xcite , specified by @xmath115 ) will be most accurate if the fluctuations @xmath116 within the @xmath108th component are small compared to @xmath117 itself @xcite .",
    "this assumption is most likely to be accurate in geometries such that @xmath118 is uniform in each of the nonlinear components , but will be less accurate when the fluctuations are large .",
    "for example , in the so - called hashin - shtrikman geometry , in which one of the two components is embedded in the other , these fluctuations are small in the embedded component , and hence this approximation will be excellent if only the embedded component is nonlinear . however , in a composite near a percolation threshold , the fluctuations will be large and this approximation will be less accurate .    if we make the approximation ( [ eq : decouple ] ) , we can express @xmath119 exactly in terms of the effective linear dielectric function @xmath98 through the relation @xmath120 here , @xmath121 is the partial derivative of @xmath98 with respect to @xmath122 , at constant @xmath123 ( @xmath124 ) and constant volume fractions @xmath125 . given a simple analytical approximation for @xmath98 , these derivatives can be easily computed in closed form , thus yielding a simple analytical approximation for @xmath99 as @xmath126 with @xmath127 .",
    "we will use this approach , combined with the analogy described above , to obtain approximations for the intermodulation coefficient in an inhomogeneous superconducting layer .    in the present work ,",
    "we use two different approximation methods to calculate @xmath98 : the effective - medium approximation ( ema ) @xcite , and the maxwell - garnett approximation ( mga ) @xcite .",
    "the ema is suitable for a binary composite with symmetrically distributed components , so that neither can be viewed as the inclusion or the host @xcite . in this case , if the components are isotropic , @xmath98 satisfies the quadratic equation @xmath128 here @xmath129 is the volume fraction of the component @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the dielectric functions of the components @xmath130 and @xmath133 , respectively , and @xmath134 is a ` depolarization factor ' : @xmath135 in two dimensions ( 2d ) and @xmath136 in 3d .",

    "we can readily use the above analogy to compute the effective nonlinear coefficients for an inhomogeneous superconducting layer .",
    "we consider a superconducting layer comprised of two `` components , '' @xmath130 and @xmath133 , with areal fractions @xmath137 and @xmath146 , which have two different energy gaps .",
    "the two components are both intrinsic to the given sample , in the sense that they are not caused by the introduction of non - superconducting impurities",

    "however , the mga with @xmath130 ( the component with the smaller gap ) embedded in @xmath133 leads to huge enhancements in @xmath1 compared to its value in either pure @xmath130 or pure @xmath133 , provided that the two gap values are sufficiently different and that @xmath163 is large .    in view of these differences , it is of interest to compare our results with the detailed measurements of davis _ et al .",
    "these experiments do not provide results directly for @xmath1 .",
    "however , they do provide some hints about a possible connection .",
    "in particular , in experiments on as - grown ni - doped samples , ni scattering resonances were observed only in the regions where @xmath200 , which were identified as superconducting regions , i.e. , regions with superconducting phase coherence . in our results ,",
    "most of the enhancement in @xmath1 comes from the enhancement factor @xmath177 , which corresponds to the component with a low energy gap .",
    "therefore the regions of enhanced @xmath1 correspond to regions of small energy gap , and also regions of enhanced phase coherence according to the measurements of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a striking feature of our results is the large difference between the ema results and the mga results , especially for binary composites with a large @xmath163 and very different energy gaps . which of these approximations is the most correct ?",
    "in fact , there is not a single correct answer for all materials : the correct choice depends on the actual topology of the material of interest . in particular , we do not know , beforehand , whether the energy gaps in an inhomogeneous superconductor are distributed at random throughout the cuo@xmath7 planes or whether regions with one magnitude of energy gap are preferentially surrounded by those of the other energy gap .",
    "this topology determines whether we should use the ema or the mga approach .    in the experimental gap maps @xcite ,",
    "the low-@xmath9 regions are surrounded by the high-@xmath9 regions in the underdoped bscco-2212 sample , but the high-@xmath9 regions are surrounded by the low-@xmath9 regions in the slightly overdoped as - grown bscco-2212 sample .",
    "therefore , it appears that we can apply the mga method to both cases , but with the roles of inclusion and host reversed in each case .",
    "but even this description of the distribution may be a simplification of the true gap distribution , which is probably continuous , not a discrete binary distribution .",
    "ideally , we should consider such a continuous distribution of energy gaps .",
    "the great sensitivity of @xmath1 to composite geometry , as found in the present work , is not surprising , in view of earlier work on transport in linear and nonlinear composite conductors and dielectric media .",
    "for example , it is well known that the critical exponents describing transport , especially nonlinear transport , in composite media are sensitive to features of the local geometry @xcite .",
    "we speculate that , depending on the precise nature of this geometry , @xmath1 either diverges or goes to zero near a percolation threshold according to an appropriate critical exponent .    in summary , we have presented a general formalism for calculating the intermodulation coefficient , and the corresponding intermodulation supercurrent density @xmath1 , of an inhomogeneous superconductor .",
    "we have also given a simple way to calculate @xmath1 approximately in several geometries . since",
    "such inhomogeneities are known to exist in many of the high-@xmath201 cuprate superconductors , this formalism is directly relevant for treating an important property of these materials .",
    "we find that the resulting @xmath1 is very sensitive to the exact spatial distribution of gaps within the inhomogeneous layer and thus may increase or decrease , depending on the topology .",
    "our calculations show that one way to achieve a large @xmath1 is to have the component with the smaller gap and larger superfluid density embedded in the component with the opposite properties .",
    "this appears to be the topology seen in the underdoped bscco-2212 , which thus may be well suited for a material with a large @xmath1 .",
    "finally , we comment briefly on possible device implications of the present results .",
    "a useful microstrip resonator would usually have a minimum of intermodulation , or interference between different frequencies @xcite . to achieve this",
    ", one would probably want a @xmath1 which is as large as possible , because this would lead to @xmath202 which has the weakest dependence on current .",
    "surprisingly , we find here that @xmath1 can actually be _ increased _ in some inhomogeneous superconductors , provided that the topology is suitable .",
    "thus the inhomogeneity which appears to be unavoidable in the high - t@xmath0 cuprates may even be an advantage in constructing useful microwave devices .",

    "we are grateful to d. j. bergman for helpful discussions .",
    "some of the calculations were carried out on the p4 cluster at the ohio supercomputer center , with the help of a grant of time .",
    "we do not , in this paper , consider the dependence of the coefficient @xmath1 on the angle @xmath203 between the current and the @xmath17-axis of the cuo@xmath6 plane , such as would be expected in a superconductor having a @xmath204 order parameter .                for reviews , see , e.g. , r. landauer , in _ electrical transport and optical properties of inhomogeneous media _ , edited by j. c. garland and d. b. tanner , aip conf .",
