    "generalized linear sigma model is successful in describing some unusual features of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons below 2 gev by allowing mixing between a quark - antiquark nonet and a four - quark nonet .",

    "mechanism for such mixing in a nonlinear chiral lagrangian was studied in ref . and",

    "the effect of possible mixing among two quark and four quark chiral nonets on the masses and some decay properties of scalar and pseudoscalar mesons , was studied in generalized linear sigma model and it was found that the scalar mesons below 1 gev are predominantly four - quark states while the lowest lying pseudoscalar mesons are closer to @xmath4 type@xcite .",
    "the role of these mixing patterns were also explored in @xmath11 @xcite , @xmath12 @xcite and @xmath13 @xcite scatterings and it was shown that the model prediction for the scattering amplitudes are reasonable and in good agreement with the experiment for the energy region below @xmath14 gev . also the poles in the scattering unitarized amplitudes , which correspond to the physical resonances , were found to represent the scalars with masses and decay widths close to experimental data .",
