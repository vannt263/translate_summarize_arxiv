    "spin correlations provide a remarkably sensitive window to hadronic structure and basic mechanisms in qcd . among the most interesting polarization effects",
    "are single - spin azimuthal asymmetries ( ssas ) in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , representing the correlation of the spin of the proton target and the virtual photon to hadron production plane : @xmath4 such asymmetries are time - reversal odd , but they can arise in qcd through phase differences in different spin amplitudes .",
    "the most common explanation of the pion electroproduction asymmetries in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering is that they are related to the transversity distribution of the quarks in the hadron @xmath5  @xcite convoluted with the transverse momentum dependent fragmentation function @xmath6 , the collins function , which gives the distribution for a transversely polarized quark to fragment into an unpolarized hadron with non - zero transverse momentum  @xcite .",
    "recently , an alternative physical mechanism for the azimuthal asymmetries has been proposed @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the qcd final - state interactions ( gluon exchange ) between the struck quark and the proton spectators in semi - inclusive deep inelastic lepton scattering can produce single - spin asymmetries which survive in the bjorken limit . in this case , the fragmentation of the quark into hadrons is not necessary , and one has a correlation with the production plane of the quark jet itself @xmath7 this final - state interaction mechanism provides a physical explanation within qcd of single - spin asymmetries .",
    "the required matrix element measures the spin - orbit correlation @xmath8 within the target hadron s wavefunction , the same matrix element which produces the anomalous magnetic moment of the proton , the pauli form factor , and the generalized parton distribution @xmath9 which is measured in deeply virtual compton scattering .",
    "physically , the final - state interaction phase arises as the infrared - finite difference of qcd coulomb phases for hadron wavefunctions with differing orbital angular momentum .",
    "a related analysis also predicts that the initial - state interactions from gluon exchange between the incoming quark and the target spectator system lead to leading - twist single - spin asymmetries in the drell - yan process @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these final- and initial - state interactions can be identified as the path - ordered exponentials which are required by gauge invariance and which augment the basic light - front wavefunctions of hadrons  @xcite .",
    "initial - state interactions also lead to a @xmath11 planar correlation in unpolarized drell - yan reactions @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis of qcd final - state interactions to ssas which can be measured in weak interaction processes .",
    "for example , consider charged current neutrino semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering , where a hadron ( pion ) is measured in the final state . in this case",
    ", the transversity distribution can not contribute to the cross section since the produced quark from the weak interaction of the @xmath0 boson is always left - handed .",
    "this point has also been noted by miyama  @xcite and boer  @xcite . on the other hand , in the final - state interaction picture",
    "the single - spin asymmetry in charged and neutral current weak interactions will be the same as in the electromagnetic case .",
    "thus these weak interaction processes will clearly distinguish the underlying physical mechanisms which produce target single - spin asymmetries .",
    "measurements of ssas in semi - inclusive neutrino deep inelastic scattering on a polarized target will be experimentally possible with the advent of a muon storage ring which can provide a high intensity well - focused neutrino beam  @xcite",
    ". however , there are also other weak interaction processes in which similar ssas should be present and which can be measured experimentally at existing facilities . for example , in this paper we will also make testable predictions for other ssas in weak interaction reactions such as the processes @xmath12 @xmath13 which can be measured at rhic  @xcite , and @xmath14 where the correlation of the @xmath15 polarization with the production plane can be measured .",
    "the final - state interaction effects can be identified with the gauge link which is present in the gauge - invariant definition of parton distributions  @xcite . when the light - cone gauge is chosen , a transverse gauge link is required .",
    "thus in any gauge the parton amplitudes need to be augmented by an additional eikonal factor incorporating the final - state interaction and its phase  @xcite .",
    "the net effect is that it is possible to define transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions which contain the effect of the qcd final - state interactions .",
    "we will use this description in this section .",
    "it has been shown that the same final - state interactions are responsible for the diffractive component to deep inelastic scattering , and that they play a critical role in nuclear shadowing phenomena  @xcite .",
    "the quark distribution in the proton is described by a correlation matrix : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "we use the convention @xmath18 , @xmath19 .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath20 is parameterized in terms of the transverse momentum dependent quark distribution functions @xcite : @xmath21}\\ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the distribution functions have arguments @xmath22 and @xmath23 such as @xmath24 , and @xmath25 . the quantity @xmath26 ( and similarly @xmath27 and @xmath28 , @xmath29 in ( [ w4 ] ) below ) is shorthand for @xmath30 with @xmath31 the mass , @xmath32 the light - cone helicity , and @xmath33 the transverse spin of the target hadron . integrating over @xmath23",
    "gives the distribution functions @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the first @xmath38 moment of @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "the quark fragmentation is described by the correlation matrix given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the quark transverse momentum with respect to the produced hadron and then @xmath43 is the produced hadron transverse momentum with respect to the fragmenting quark .",

    "the single - spin asymmetry ( ssa ) in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering ( sidis ) @xmath56 , which is given by the correlation @xmath57 , is obtained from ( [ w5 ] ) . for the electromagnetic interaction ,",
    "there are two mechanisms for this ssa : @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the former was first studied by collins  @xcite , and the latter by sivers  @xcite ; it was shown recently that the sivers effect does not vanish in the bjorken limit  @xcite .",

    "the basic electroproduction reaction is then @xmath64 .",
    "in fact , the asymmetry comes from the interference of two amplitudes which have different proton spin but couple to the same final quark spin state , and therefore it involves the interference of tree and one - loop diagrams with a final - state interaction . in this simple model the azimuthal target single - spin asymmetry @xmath65 is given by @xcite @xmath66}\\nonumber \\\\ & \\times & \\bigg[\\ { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}}_{\\perp}^2+\\delta ( 1-\\delta)(-m^2+{m^2\\over\\delta } + { \\lambda^2\\over 1-\\delta})\\ \\bigg ] \\nonumber\\\\[1ex ] & \\times & \\ { 1\\over { { \\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}}_{\\perp}^2}\\ { \\rm ln}{{{\\mbox{\\boldmath $ r$}}}_{\\perp}^2 + \\delta ( 1-\\delta)(-m^2+{m^2\\over\\delta}+{\\lambda^2\\over 1-\\delta})\\over \\delta ( 1-\\delta)(-m^2+{m^2\\over\\delta}+{\\lambda^2\\over 1-\\delta})}\\ . \\label{sa2b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath67 is the magnitude of the transverse momentum of the current quark jet relative to the virtual photon direction , and @xmath68 is the usual bjorken variable . to obtain ( [ sa2b ] ) from eq .",
