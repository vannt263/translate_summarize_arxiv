    "the corresponding maki parameter @xmath23 = @xmath30__h@xmath16__(0)/_h@xmath27 _ is @xmath23 = 1.99 and 1.31 for _ h @xmath14 c _ and _ h @xmath13 c _ , respectively .",

    "therefore , to fully explain the temperature dependence of _ h@xmath6 _ for each field direction , one might have to consider the interplay between the pauli and orbital limiting mechanism in the two - band system .    in summary , we find that a single crystal of srfe@xmath1co@xmath2as@xmath3 shows nearly isotropic _",
