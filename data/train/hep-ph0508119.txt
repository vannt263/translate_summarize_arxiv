    "the idea that quantum gravity can appear at the tev energy scale well below the planck mass @xmath9gev was proposed in the 1990s@xcite .",
    "the large extra dimensions(led ) model@xcite introduced by arkani - hamed , dimopoulos and davli has attracted much attention .",
    "it has been emphasized that the presence of large extra dimensions brings a new solution to the hierarchy problem , which can take the place of other mechanisms , for example , low - energy supersymmetry .",
    "however , it also interesting to examine a scenario which combines new physics beyond the standard model(sm ) such as the 2hdm@xcite and led .",
    "this new possibility leads to different phenomenology than the usual led scenario , which we explore here .    in this",
    "extended led scenario , as in the usual led scheme , the total space - time has @xmath10 dimensions .",
    "the sm and new particles beyond the sm live in the usual @xmath11dimensional space , while gravity can propagate in the additional @xmath12-dimensional space , which is assumed for simplicity to be compactified on the @xmath12-dimensional torus @xmath13 with a common radius r. then the 4-dimensional planck scale @xmath14 is no longer the relevant scale but is related to the fundamental scale @xmath15 as follows@xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 .",
    "according to eq .",
    "( [ scale ] ) , deviations from the usual newtonian gravitational force law can be expected at distances smaller than @xmath18@xcite . for @xmath19 , led is consistent with the current experiments@xcite since gravitational forces are not yet well probed at distances less than sbout a millimeter ( however for @xmath20 , there are constraints arising from , e.g. , supernova cooling , which require @xmath21 if @xmath20 @xcite ) .",
    "2hdm led can be tested at future high energy colliders . in 2hdm",
    "led , just as in led , there exist kk towers of massive spin-2 gravitons and scalars which can interact with the sm and beyond sm fields .",
    "there are two classes of effects that can probe led : real graviton emission and virtual kk tower exchange .    at future linear colliders",
    "the search for one or more higgs bosons will be a central task . in the sm ,",
    "the higgs boson mass is a free parameter with an upper bound of @xmath22  800gev @xcite . beyond the sm ,",
    "the 2hdm is of particular theoretical interest , in which the two complex higgs doublets correspond to eight scalar states and spontanoues symmetry breaking leads to five physical higgs bosons : two neutral cp - even bosons @xmath23 and @xmath24 , one neutral cp - odd boson @xmath25 , and two charged bosons @xmath26 .",
    "the @xmath23 is the lightest and is a sm - like higgs boson especially in the decoupling region ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the other four are not sm - like and their discovery , particularly the charged higgs bosons , would provide evidence for the 2hdm .",
    "if the @xmath26 bosons have mass @xmath28 , they will be produced mainly through the @xmath29 decays of top quarks , which can be produced singly or in pairs at an @xmath30 lc @xcite .",
    "if there is sufficient center of mass energy available , @xmath31 , then charged higgs pair production , @xmath0 , will be the dominant production mechanism@xcite .",
    "however , if @xmath32 , then @xmath26 bosons can only be produced singly .",
    "and @xmath1@xcite is one of the most important single charged higgs production processes that can also be used to measure the relevant yukawa couplings .",
    "therefore , for this process , we will focus on the regime where @xmath33 . for @xmath34  gev ( 1000  gev ) , this implies that @xmath35  gev ( @xmath36  gev ) .",
    "there are several kinds of such 2hdm models . in the model",
    "called type i , one higgs doublet provides masses for both the up - type and down - type quarks . in the type ii model",
    ", one higgs doublet gives masses to the up - type quarks and the other one to the down - type quarks . in the type iii model ,",
    "both doublets contribute to generate the masses for up - type and down - type quarks . in this paper",
    ", we will concentrate on the type ii 2hdm(2hdm ii ) , which are is favored by the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm)@xcite .",
    "we will also briefly discussed the results in the type i 2hdm .    in the following we consider the the contributions of virtual kk gravitons to the 2hdm charged higgs production , especially in the two important production processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 at future linear colliders .",

    "the 2hdm diagrams , including the additional virtual kk gravitons(@xmath37 ) , which contribute to the processes @xmath0 and @xmath4 are presented in figs .  1 and  2 , respectively .",
    "in the four dimensional description the interaction lagrangian between the scattering fields and the kk gravitons ( @xmath38 ) or kk scalars ( @xmath39 ) is given by @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 with @xmath42 s being integers , @xmath43gev is the reduced four dimensional planck scale , and @xmath44 is the energy - momentum tensor of the scattering fields .",
    "the @xmath45-th kk mode graviton and scaler masses squared are both characterized by @xmath46 . since the trace of the energy - momentum tensor is proportional to the mass of the fields due to the field equations , we neglect processes mediated by the kk scalars in our study for the linear @xmath47 collider , and consider only the processes mediated by the kk gravitons .    from eq",

    "<S> in the two - higgs - doublet model(2hdm ) with large extra dimensions(led ) , we study the contributions of virtual kaluza - klein(kk ) gravitons to 2hdm charged higgs production , especially in the two important production processes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , at future linear colliders ( lc ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that kk graviton effects can significantly modify these total cross sections and also their differential cross sections compared to their respective 2hdm values and , therefore , can be used to probe the effective scale @xmath2 up to several tev . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at @xmath3tev , the cross sections for @xmath0 and @xmath4 in the 2hdm are 7.4fb for @xmath5gev and 0.003fb for @xmath6tev and @xmath7 , while in led they are 12.1fb and 0.01fb , respectively , for @xmath8tev . </S>"
