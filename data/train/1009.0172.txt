    "observations of long gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) by a number of spacecrafts during the last decades revealed that their @xmath11-ray prompt emission is over after @xmath12 s. however , after the launch of _ swift _",
    "( @xcite ) evidence is accumulating that the central engine of the grb sources could still be active hours after the main burst .",
    "this is mainly linked to the discovery of large amplitude , episodic re - brightenings with typical @xmath13 in the @xmath14 of x - ray afterglows : the x - ray flares ( see @xcite , c10 hereafter , for a recent compilation ) .",
    "the temporal properties of x - ray flares make it difficult to interpret the observed emission in the framework of the external shock scenario ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the strict analogy found by @xcite ( m10 hereafter ) between the temporal and spectral behaviour of x - ray flares and prompt emission pulses strongly suggests a common , internal origin .",
    "the direct implication is that flares directly trace the activity of the central engine . to account for the details of the flare emission ,",
    "grb central engines ( ce ) are required to have the following basic properties ( c10 , m10 and references therein ) :    1 .",
    "_ energetics_. the average flare fluence is @xmath15 the prompt 15 - 150 kev fluence .",
    "however , ces should be able to produce x - ray flares whose fluence is able to compete in some cases ( e.g. grb050502b ) with the prompt @xmath11-ray fluence .",
    "the typical early - time flare isotropic energy is @xmath16 .",
    "the flare peak luminosity decays as @xmath17 for @xmath18 s. 2 .   _",
    "lifetime_. ces are required to be long - lived and in particular to be active up to @xmath19 s after the end of the prompt emission .",
    "the probability of a ce to re - start decays with time .",
    "variability_. ces are required to store and release energy in the form of erratic , short - lived episodes of emission giving rise to flares whose duration linearly grows with time .",
    "ideas on how to revive the ce have been explored by a number of authors : flares could be the result of a two - stage stellar collapse leading to core fragmentation and subsequent accretion ( @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , the fragmentation of the outer part of an hyper - accreting disk into rings of material as a result of gravitational instabilities could potentially lead to large - amplitude variations of the ce output ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , @xcite noticed that tidal disruption of a fragment and accretion by the central black hole might be too rapid to account for the durations of observed flares .",
    "@xcite proposed that magnetic flux accumulated around the accretor could stop and then restart the ce release of energy possibly giving rise to flares .",
    "@xcite invoked the presence of a differentially rotating millisecond pulsar where magnetic reconnection events are responsible for the observed flare emission .",
    "magnetic reconnection is also suggested by @xcite in the framework of the internal plus external shock scenario with strongly magnetised ejecta : in this case , no late - time ce activity is needed and flares come from the revival of mhd instabilities triggered by the deceleration of the magnetised ejecta in the external medium .",
    "the entire list of flare models basically refers to two different ces : an accretion disk around a newly formed black hole ( e.g. @xcite ) or a rapidly rotating magnetar ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in magnetar models",
    "the ultimate source of energy is represented by the magnetar spin and flares are likely to be connected to episodes of magnetic energy dissipation . in the case of accretion models ,",
    "the source of energy powering the flare emission is possibly of gravitational origin .",
    "however , magnetic effects could still play the key role , deeply affecting the accretion dynamics and release of energy ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "x - ray flares mark the late time activity of the ce after the main power emission and provide information about the way the ce power is progressively declining . in the following we show that this information turns out to be of fundamental importance in constraining existing ce models ( accretion or magnetar ) .    the main goal of this work is to compute the evolution of the average luminosity of the flaring component with time , taking advantage from the large _ swift _ 5-years data - base . a variety of physical mechanisms which might properly account for the new episodes of energy release are discussed in the context of both accretion and magnetar ce models .",
    "a previous attempt in this direction was made by @xcite ( l08 hereafter ) : from a sample of 9 long grbs and 1 short grb ( which was the largest sample with known redshift available at that time ) these authors showed that the average flare luminosity follows a power - law decay @xmath20 and concluded that accretion onto a compact object could reasonably account for the @xmath0 decay . in the present work we aim at presenting a substantial update of the l08 sample , including 44 grbs with redshift ; the flare luminosity of each grb is computed in the rest frame energy band which is common to the entire sample : this assures @xmath0 to be obtained from strictly comparable properties of each grb .",
    "moreover , no assumption is made on the functional form of the flare temporal profile . finally , since flares are detected as sharp features _",
    "superimposed _ to the x - ray afterglow , it is of fundamental importance to understand the associated observational biasses : we compute the temporal evolution of the flare detection threshold for each grb , and quantitatively discuss the influence of the flare detection threshold on the obtained @xmath0 temporal evolution .",
