    "the unexpected discovery of giant planets orbiting their host stars with periods of a few days @xcite made it clear that our theories of planet formation and evolution are incomplete ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "although progress has been made toward understanding the the presence of short - period giant planets , many details of their formation and evolution remain uncertain .    that short - period planets form from circumstellar disks is clear , but the exact mechanism in which disk material condenses to form planets has yet to be established .",
    "jupiter mass planets are thought to form through one of two mechanisms : core accretion @xcite , in which a rocky or icy core reaches a critical mass and rapidly accretes an envelope of gas , or gravitational instability @xcite , in which the massive , cool disk fragments and collapses into giant planets .",
    "core accretion theories have historically had difficulty producing planets of the correct masses and locations of the giant planets in our solar system within a @xmath6 myr protoplanetary disk lifetime ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , although recent work has been more successful ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . gravitational instability , on the other hand , requires relatively cool , quiescent disk conditions and sufficiently short cooling timescales , both of which may not be physically realistic at the radii at which gas giants are thought to form @xcite .",
    "it is clear that short - period giant planets can not form _ in situ _ , since protoplanetary disks at a few tenths of an au are too hot and do not contain sufficient mass to produce a gas giant .",
    "therefore , in addition to the uncertainties regarding the formation mechanism , we must face additional uncertainties related to the means by which a planet migrates from its hypothesized birthsite in order to explain gas giants in short - period orbits . in what is labeled type i",
    "migration @xcite , the planet experiences torques from the massive gaseous disk , a loss of angular momentum , and subsequent inward motion toward the star .",
    "sufficiently massive planets are capable of opening a gap in the circumstellar disk , which can also result in inward drift as the disk accretes onto the star ; this is called type ii migration @xcite .",
    "recently , planet migration through planet - planet scattering and eccentricity pumping due to a stellar binary companion coupled with tidal dissipation ( `` kozai migration '' ) have also been proposed as migration mechanisms ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the relative importance of each of these mechanisms to the process of planetary migration remains unclear .",
    "each of these different formation mechanisms should imprint certain signatures onto the resulting planet population .",
    "one hopes , with a sufficiently large observed sample of planets , to be able to determine the relative importance of each of these formation channels . from an observational point - of - view ,",
    "the way to understand the origin of short - period planets is to search a large number of stars for planets and produce a correspondingly rich sample of exoplanets .",
    "the statistical properties of these planets and their observed frequency can then help to constrain models of planet formation and evolution .",
    "it is therefore essential that any sample of stars searched for planets has well characterized properties so that trends among the stars that are found to host planets can be recognized .",
    "@xcite suggested that open clusters were ideal targets for planet searches since they host such a uniform and easily characterizable population of stars .",
    "in contrast to field stars , the metallicity , age , and distance to cluster stars are relatively easy to determine . as such",
    ", open clusters represent a potential testbed for planet formation theories .",
    "the frequency of short - period planets provides information about how often gas giants form , migrate , and survive in a single , uniform , coeval population of stars .",
    "furthermore , observations of several clusters of different metallicities allow us to probe the planet - metallicity correlation @xcite , in which higher metallicity field stars are more likely to host a planet .",
    "planet search surveys in clusters also allow us to characterize the degree to which the cluster environment itself impacts the formation and survival of planetary systems .",
    "the cluster properties at birth and throughout its evolution are critical to determining whether the cluster environment is capable of affecting the formation and survival of planetary systems .",
    "the degree to which the effects of close encounters and photoevaporating radiation present in dense stellar environments influences the formation , evolution , and survival of planets are not well understood .",
    "there is evidence that the observed stellar densities of old open clusters today are significantly less than they were at birth , and that the current environments in old open clusters are not what they were during the first 5 - 10 myr when giant planets were presumably forming . in particular",
    ", a given cluster may lose 10 - 80% of its stars in the process of emerging from its embedded stage , and thus only the initially most massive clusters survive and are observed as old open clusters today ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the degree to which planetary systems are affected by the cluster environment is still poorly understood both observationally and theoretically .",
    "theoretical investigations of the importance of environment @xcite suggest that open clusters are not dense enough to significantly affect the formation and survival rates of planets , especially within the @xmath7 5 - 30 au in which gas giants that later migrate are thought to form .",
    "however , observations of the orion nebula cluster ( onc ) @xcite found that less than @xmath8 of the stars harbor disks of mass comparable to that of the minimum mass solar nebula , and that the frequency of disks decreased with proximity to the massive central trapezium stars .",
    "they also claim that the frequency of disks in the dense onc is statistically different from that of the lower density taurus cluster .",
    "a similar study of the arches also detected a disk fraction that varies with proximity to the massive , central stars @xcite .",
    "of the numerous planet detection methods available to astronomers , photometric transit searches are among the most logical choices for an open cluster survey @xcite .",
    "transit surveys have the ability to monitor a large number of stars simultaneously , and benefit from the fact that cluster stars are concentrated over a small portion of the sky .",
    "photometric surveys can also be performed on smaller , more easily accessible telescopes than competing methods of planet detection @xcite .",
    "the photometric data are simple to calibrate , and in the case of clusters the metallicities , distance , ages , and radii for all stars can be obtained with relative ease . because the technological requirements for a successful photometric survey are fulfilled by modest and readily available instruments ,",
    "transit searches are a simple and direct method of detecting planets in these systems , with the caveat that the radial velocity follow - up needed to confirm planet candidates is not always as easily obtained ( see * ? ? ?",
    ".    however , despite a number of transit searches targeting open clusters @xcite , no convincing planetary transits have been found .",
    "there are two possible explanations for this paucity of planets @xcite : either there is something different about the planet populations of open clusters , or there are simply too few observed cluster stars to detect a planet from an otherwise `` typical '' planet population .",
    "the frequency of short - period planets is @xmath9 @xcite , and the geometric probability that such a planet transits is only @xmath10 , meaning that one naively expects to observe @xmath11 stars before detecting even one transiting planet . because the transit depths are small ( @xmath9 ) and have a low duty cycle , both precise ( to a few milimagnitudes ) photometry and excellent temporal coverage are required in any transit search . when one considers the need for sufficient a signal - to - noise ratio and multiple observed transits for robust detection , it is generally the case that many more than 1000 stars must be monitored to detect any transiting planets @xcite .",
    "since the richest open clusters contain a few thousand stars at best , the lack of detected transiting planets in any individual survey may simply be due to an insufficient number of target stars .",
    "while each survey alone may not observe a sufficient number of stars to have expected a planet detection , we estimate the total number of cluster stars observed in all transit surveys to be roughly 10,000 , and that combined the sample of stars is rich enough to derive interesting upper limits on the frequency of short - period planets . by carefully statistically combining the null results of several photometric surveys , we provide a more stringent upper limit than is possible with individual studies , and",
    "then compare this limit to the frequencies of planets among field stars derived from both photometric and radial velocity surveys .",
    "as we will show , the typical detection efficiencies of these photometric surveys are insufficient , even with 10,000 total stars , to place tighter constraints on the frequency of short - period planets than surveys of field stars , and thus we conclude that these combined upper limits are consistent with the observed frequency of short - period giant planets in the field . given the available data , we have no reason to suspect that the population of short - period planets in open clusters is anything other than `` ordinary '' .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in  [ sec : methods ] we discuss the manner in which upper limits on planet frequencies are derived from transit surveys and how their individual results can be combined , in ",
    "[ sec : surveys ] we discuss our selection of the transit surveys included in our analysis and the normalization of individual survey results . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] we present our combined upper limits .  [ sec : discussion ] and  [ sec : conclusion ] are devoted to discussion and our conclusions , respectively .",
    "the techniques used to find planets in any photometric survey are broadly similar . all surveys attempt to achieve high photometric accuracy with maximal temporal coverage over the longest possible period of time .",
    "the better the temporal coverage , the more sensitive a survey is to all transits , and the longer the duration of the survey , the larger the range of planetary periods that are detectable .",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for extensive discussions of the factors that determine a survey s sensitivity to transits and the design of successful surveys .",
    "once the data have been collected , one produces light curves and searches for periodic variability .",
    "the box - fitting least - squares ( bls ) method introduced by @xcite is a popular means to do so within the transit community .",
    "the algorithm searches for periodic , rectangular deviations from a flat light curve , and is an objective , repeatable means of identifying transit candidates .",
    "conversely , some authors may choose to identify transits by eye .",
    "regardless of the method used to identify photometric eclipses , the planetary nature of convincing transit candidates must then be confirmed with radial velocity follow - up observations , since astrophysical false positives can mimic the transit of a jupiter - sized object .    in the case of a null result , some authors choose to carefully quantify their detection efficiencies and place upper limits on the frequency of short - period planets .",
    "one typically injects a large number of simulated , limb - darkened transits into constant simulated stars or light curves from the survey itself , and then subjects these transits to the same detection algorithms with the same selection criteria as the original data .",
    "the fraction of injected transits that are recovered quantifies the detection efficiency .",
    "this efficiency is a complicated combination of effects that is discussed in more detail in the next section .",
    "while the general process is similar for all surveys , the details of how each author chooses to perform the steps varies slightly , and in practice it is not necessarily correct to directly compare or combine the results of two surveys .",
    "authors may make different assumptions about the period distribution of planets , or quote their results for differing planetary radii , etc .",
    ", all of which are important when comparing the results of multiple different surveys . in order to combine the results of several surveys ,",
    "we must re - normalize , to the extent that we can , to a common set of assumptions .      in this section",
    "we discuss the mathematical description of the detection efficiency of a transit survey , the calculation of upper limits on the frequency of planets using a null result , and the method for combining several normalized surveys into a single upper limit .",
    "in general , the expected number of planets detected in the radius range @xmath12 to @xmath13 and period range @xmath14 to @xmath15 can be written @xcite    @xmath16    where @xmath17 is the star , the sum is over all @xmath18 stars , and @xmath19 is the probability that the star is a cluster member .",
    "@xmath20 is the fraction of stars that host short - period planets distributed as @xmath21 .",
    "we assume @xmath21 is independent of the stellar mass .",
    "this distribution is poorly constrained by exoplanet statistics , and is usually assumed as a prior .",
    "we will assume that this distribution is a delta function in the radius and uniform in the logarithm of the period :    @xmath22    where @xmath23 is the planetary radius of interest .",
    "@xmath24 is the geometric probability that a planet transits its host star , such that @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the radius of the star and @xmath27 is the semimajor axis of the orbit , where we have assumed the orbit is circular.@xmath28 is the probability that a planet of radius @xmath12 and period @xmath14 will be detected around star @xmath17 if it transits , given the precise temporal coverage , precision , and signal - to - noise ratio of the observations . in practice",
    "@xmath29 is trivial to calculate , while @xmath30 is emphatically not so .",
    "it is , in general , the single most difficult factor to characterize in the entire formalism because it represents a complex interplay between numerous different observational effects .",
    "simple analytic estimates of @xmath30 tend to overestimate the probability that the survey will be capable of detecting transits @xcite . the best way to characterize",
    "@xmath30 is to perform monte carlo simulations _ a posteriori _ with transits injected into the light curves of constant stars observed in the survey or simulated constant stars .    when authors choose to perform an analysis of the detection efficiencies with monte carlo simulations , the resulting efficiencies generally account for @xmath30 , @xmath29 , and @xmath21",
    "by injecting transits with randomly sampled parameters from an assumed period distribution into stars in the survey that were searched for transits , one automatically accounts for the intrinsic mass function of stars and planet period distributions .",
    "factors such as noise present in the light curves and the observing window , which are crucial to determining @xmath30 , are also automatically included in transit injection and recovery schemes .",
    "@xmath31 is generally determined separately through proper motion measurements , proximity of a star to the cluster main sequence , off - cluster comparison fields , or modeling of the field star population to determine contamination levels . after the detection efficiencies are quantified ,",
    "one has    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the number of transiting planets that are expected to be detected , and @xmath20 is the only unknown factor . by assuming that @xmath28 is independent from @xmath19 for each star we can define an average membership probability @xmath34 .",
    "while these two factors are not strictly uncorrelated , it is a reasonable approximation and simplifies the analysis considerably . using this assumption we can average over all of the stars in a survey such that @xmath35 where @xmath36 is the average probability over all stars that a planet will both transit _ and _ be detected .    in the case in which no planets are detected over the course of the survey",
    ", one can derive an upper limit on the frequency of planets of a given radius within a specific period range .",
    "formally , the probability of seeing @xmath37 successful detections in @xmath18 independent trials , each with a probability of success @xmath38 is given by the binomial distribution @xmath39 because the number of stars ( and therefore trials ) is large and the probability of detecting a planet around a given star is small , we can assume the poisson approximation to the binomial distribution without compromising our results .",
    "the probability of detecting @xmath37 events when the number of expected events is @xmath33 is @xmath40 in the case of a non - detection , @xmath41 and @xmath42 as mentioned earlier , the number of detections we expect for a given survey goes as @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the number of cluster members observed .",
    "the 95% confidence upper limit on the planet fraction ( when @xmath45 ) is then @xmath46    the multiple surveys that we utilize in this paper each quote a value of @xmath20 or @xmath47 specific to their observations , chosen planetary radii , and period ranges . provided the limits or detection efficiencies for all surveys are quoted for the same planetary radii and period ranges , the upper limits from individual surveys can be combined using @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the combined upper limit on the planet fraction , and @xmath50 indexes individual surveys .",
    "the expression for @xmath49 can be written simply as @xmath51",
    "although the general planet search techniques and subsequent quantification of detection efficiencies are relatively similar among the photometric surveys considered here , there are always slightly different assumptions made during the process by different authors . in the transit surveys we ultimately selected for our study ,",
    "the two main areas in which differences were apparent were the assumptions made about the period distribution of planets and the estimates of cluster membership .",
    "such differences are relatively straightforward to re - normalize , and do not pose a fundamental obstacle to combining the surveys .",
    "however , in the cases in which authors do not quantify their detection efficiency sufficiently , or do so only in terms of the most simplistic analytic estimates , we can not re - normalize their results , and therefore can not include them here .",
    "we also have no way to quantify the detection efficiency of transit surveys in which the transits were identified `` by eye '' , and so these too can not be utilized .",
    "we choose transit surveys with the following characteristics that make it possible to re - normalize and combine their results :    1 .",
    "transits are detected through the use of an automatic transit detection algorithm with rigorous , defined thresholds of detection .",
    "specifically,``by eye '' transit detection is not sufficient , since detection probabilities are not quantifiable .",
    "a simulation of detection efficiency was conducted using constant stars , and injected transits are limb - darkened and have a representative sampling of periods , inclinations , and planetary radii .",
    "this allows for a realistic quantification of elements such as the window of observations , instrument noise , and the effectiveness of the transit detection algorithms .",
    "survey results must be accompanied by an estimate of cluster membership probabilities .",
    "it is essential that we have a reasonable estimate of the actual number of observed cluster stars , as opposed to a blind mixture of cluster and field stars . without a membership estimate ,",
    "any upper limits derived from the survey results for the frequency of planets in clusters is not meaningful .",
    "surveys are included in cases in which membership is not explicitly estimated but sufficient information to do so is available .",

    "secondly , estimates of cluster membership are lacking or in need of fine tuning , and we therefore estimate membership probabilities based on the information provided in each of the three papers .    in all three papers",

    "the net effect of this correction is to increase the detection probability of short - period planets relative to that of longer period planets .",
    "each period - frequency histogram bin is an _ average _ over all planetary radii and inclinations .",
    "if we wish to calculate the probability of detection for a particular radius , we must multiply the bins by yet another scaling factor that quantifies whether a transit of a particular planetary radius is detected more or less efficiently than average .",

    "this technique is applied to all three of the clusters ngc 188 , ngc 2158 and ngc 6791 .",
    "as noted earlier , it is critical that we have estimates of the actual number of cluster stars observed .",
    "the m05 paper provides estimates the number of cluster and field stars in the sample used for the transit analysis .",
    "candidate cluster members are selected as those stars that lie within 0.06 mag of the @xmath110 vs.@xmath111 cluster main sequence . while this significantly reduces the field star contamination ,",
    "there is still a non - negligible number of field stars among these candidate cluster members that happen to have the same colors as the cluster main sequence . to quantify this contamination we use the besancon stellar population synthesis galaxy model @xcite to estimate the number of field stars that should be present in the region of the cluster cmd used to determine membership",
    "secondly , to confirm the result of the first method , we then estimate the typical field star density on the cmd and check that the resulting membership is consistent with the estimates derived from the galaxy model .",
    "we first utilized the besancon galaxy model to estimate the number of field stars expected in the m05 field of ngc 6791 .",
    "the models were run for a field of view of 0.144 deg@xmath112 with 25 dust clouds evenly spaced every 2pc from the observer , each with an extinction of 0.019 for a total @xmath113 from @xcite .",
    "we found that this yielded more realistic star counts than using a uniform diffuse extinction over the entire distance to the cluster .",
    "we restrict the sample in the same manner as m05 to stars with @xmath111 magnitudes @xmath114 , which corresponds to all stars below the main sequence turnoff and an rms uncertainty in the @xmath111 magnitude in the m05 survey of less than 0.05 mag .",
    "all stars from the besancon simulation within 0.06 mag of the cluster main sequence were then selected as field star contaminants .",
    "1523 of the 5225 field stars predicted by the model were within this region .",
    "the m05 member selection method therefore would have found 1523 cluster and 3702 fields stars in this model data .",
    "it is important to note that we do not trust the absolute star counts produced by the model , but expect the fractional number of stars that have colors similar to the cluster main sequence to be more accurate .",
    "the ratio of stars detected off of the main sequence in m05 and the simulation is @xmath115 , and thus m05 sees @xmath116 fewer stars that are more than 0.06 mag from the ms than the simulations of the same field .",
    "we scale the number of stars present in the model near the ms to the ratio of the number of stars detected in the field portions of both the simulated and actual cluster cmd .",
    "we would therefore expect that @xmath117 stars selected as cluster members in m05 are actually field star contaminants .",
    "this implies that only 1997 of 3178 candidate cluster stars are likely to be true members , so @xmath118 .",
    "another simple , and somewhat crude , method of estimating the field star contamination is to simply find the average density of stars on the cluster cmd near , but not on , the main sequence .",
    "this density , multiplied by the area covered by the main sequence ( in mag@xmath119 ) , yields an estimate of the number of field stars contaminating the selected sample of cluster stars .",
    "we find surface densities of 650 - 700 stars mag@xmath120 and thus the main sequence area of @xmath121 mag@xmath119 yields roughly 300 contaminating stars along the ms strip on the single - field cmd in figure 2 of m05 .",
    "this would correspond to roughly 1200 stars over all four observed fields , and about 2000 true cluster members . while the method is approximate at best",
    ", it yields a reassuringly similar result .",
    "finally , @xcite find that the cluster cmd is subject to 30@xmath122 contamination by field stars for stars with @xmath123 mag in ngc 6791 , which is again comparable to our estimates .",
    "m08 does not provide any estimate of the number of cluster stars observed in ngc 188 .",

    "is centered on the cluster and @xmath126 stars are detected in m08 .",

    "372 stars have membership probabilities @xmath128 , and 234 stars have @xmath129 . to be conservative , we assume that all stars with @xmath129 are field stars . for a reference field size of @xmath130",

    "m08 covers 7 @xmath130 fields , so we expect 1234 field stars . since",
    "2031 stars are detected on all 7 chips combined , this suggests that 1234 are field stars , and the remaining 797 are cluster members , and so @xmath135 . we note that the earlier estimates that made use of the besancon model are not feasible here , since we have no estimate of the number of field stars with which to calibrate the star counts returned by the model .",
    "the m06 analysis of ngc 2158 also did not include any estimate of the number of cluster members observed . in this case , existing surveys of the cluster contained either no membership information , covered too small a field of view to be easily comparable , or did not cover the relevant magnitude ranges .",
    "to be conservative , then , we make the assumption that m06 field 1 centered on @xmath136 contains only field stars .",
    "this is a @xmath137 region centered roughly 16 from the cluster center .",
    "@xcite estimates the maximum radius of the cluster to be @xmath138 , so this field likely contains at least some cluster stars , although the steep radial density profile of the cluster ( see fig . 6 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggests it will be minimal .",
    "note also that field 1 in m06 is also the most distant field of the four from nearby m35 , which produces a slight gradient in the star counts across the m06 fields .",
    "m06 finds 675 stars in this field with photometry of suitable quality to be used in the search for transits .",
    "if we assume all of these stars are field stars it implies that there are a total of 2700 field stars across all four fields . a total 5159 stars , both cluster and field , with suitable photometry were found in all four fields .",
    "we can then estimate @xmath139 as @xmath140 .",
    "this is a conservative estimate of the fraction of the observed stars that are true cluster members , since it is unlikely that all 675 stars were truly field stars .",
    "this approach preserves the fidelity of the upper limits we derive using this value .",
    "the @xcite survey of ngc 1245 includes detailed detection probability simulations and careful treatment of cluster membership .",
    "membership probabilities are determined using a star s proximity on the color magnitude diagram of ngc 1245 to the best fit isochrone . because each individual star is assigned a separate membership probability , we do not correct further for field star contamination as we did in the m05 ngc 6791 survey .",
    "planets are assumed to be uniform in the logarithm of the semimajor axis , which is equivalent , up to an irrelevant normalization constant , to a distribution uniform in @xmath94 .",

    "if anything , the constraints on the slightly longer period range should be weaker than those of the @xmath3 day range , and so we are conservative in adopting the value of @xmath146 for the @xmath3 day 1.5 @xmath145 planets . no limit could be placed on the frequency of 1.0 @xmath145 planets in this period range .",
    "as with the other surveys , the @xcite analysis of ngc 2362 light curves relies on objective and clearly defined thresholds of detection and a transit injection scheme to characterize the sensitivity of the survey .",
    "a rough estimate of cluster membership from @xcite using both field star counts from the besancon galaxy model and simple radial distribution arguments arrives at a field star contamination of roughly @xmath147 over the magnitude range of stars utilized in the transit search .",

    "note that @xmath152 simply means that the data is only able to place limits on the fraction of stars with more than one planet in a given period range .",

    "we expect that by neglecting the observations present in these other surveys our derived upper limits may be up to a factor of two too high .",
    "however , it is highly unlikely that all of these surveys have achieved the optimistic @xmath199 detection efficiency , and improbable that all have even achieved a @xmath200 efficiency .",
    "we therefore conclude that neglecting these other surveys does not qualitatively change our primarily conclusion , that the lack of detections is consistent with the hypothesis that cluster and field stars host the same planet population .",
    "we do note that , had each of these surveys carefully quantified their detection efficiencies , the constraints on the number of short - period planets in open clusters could have been noticeably tighter .",
    "it is useful to ask , given our results , how many more cluster stars must be observed in surveys with null results before the combined upper limit derived using all extant surveys becomes inconsistent with the observed frequency of planets around field stars . because of the low detection efficiencies and relatively few suitable open clusters in our galaxy , it is unlikely that upper limits derived from transit surveys in open clusters will be inconsistent with the results of c08 and g06 in the near future , even if it is the case that the frequency of planets in open clusters is significantly lower than that of the field . for the c08 result , a combined upper limit ( at 95% confidence ) would be inconsistent with the 68% confidence lower bound on the c08 frequency of the fraction of stars with planets was found to be @xmath202 for 1.2 @xmath145 planets in the @xmath3 day period range .",
    "the six - survey upper limit is @xmath203 , which implies that @xmath204 more cluster stars must be observed ( with null results ) at a 0.5% detection efficiency before the limit is in conflict with c08 ( currently , @xmath205 stars have been observed at @xmath206 efficiency ) .",
    "this number drops to 9000 with a detection efficiency of 1.0% .",
    "given that there are about 1200 known open clusters in the galaxy ( webda ) , only a handful of which are rich enough to contain thousands of stars , the only way to make the upper limits on the planet frequency in open clusters derived from transit surveys competitive with field surveys is to drastically increase the detection efficiency of the surveys _ and _ number of clusters observed . when we ask how many stars would need to be observed to be competitive with the g06 field star planet frequency , the requirements are even more strict .",
    "surveys would need to cover @xmath207 stars at 0.5% detection efficiency before the upper limits , at 90% confidence , would be inconsistent with the 68% confidence lower bound on the g06 frequency .",
    "when we consider the upper limits on vhjs even more additional stars are required .",
    "we conclude that the current upper limits of the hj and vhj frequencies determined using the null results of transit surveys in open clusters do not suggest a significant difference between the frequency of planets in open clusters and the field .",
    "open clusters remain , to the best of our knowledge , a viable and useful target for exoplanet transit surveys , and we do not yet have enough data to discern whether the environments of open clusters have any noticeable effect on planet formation and survival .",
    "we recommend that any future surveys carefully quantify any null results , since the combination of many such outcomes has the potential to better constrain the frequency of short - period planets and answer interesting questions about the formation of planets in stellar clusters .",
