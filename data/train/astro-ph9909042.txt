    "clusters of galaxies were first detected as large concentrations of galaxies . with the advent of x - ray astronomy also x - ray emission from galaxy clusters was found . this emission could be explained as thermal bremsstrahlung from hot gas filling the whole potential well of the cluster ( e.g. sarazin 1986 ) .",
    "moreover , in many clusters radio emission was found .",
    "this radio emission is synchrotron emission from relativistic particles .",
    "table  1 summarises the main cluster components together with their mass fractions .",
    "while galaxies contribute only @xmath0 to the cluster mass , the contribution of the gas is considerably more ( @xmath1% ; see e.g. arnaud & evrard 1999 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ) .",
    "but , as these two contributions are by far not 100% , it is concluded that most of the mass is in form of dark matter , i.e. not directly observable",
    ". therefore mass determinations , which are indirect measurements of the dark matter , are so particularly interesting in clusters .",
    "the list of components summarises only the main cluster components and main frequencies , at which clusters are observed .",
    "of course this list is not complete , and clusters are also observable at other frequencies , e.g. non - thermal , hard x - ray emission was detected in some clusters ( see fusco - femiano et al .",
    "1999 ) . in the following several fields of cluster research are presented .",
    "also this compilation can not be complete with only limited space available .",
    "only a few topics could be selected and handled very briefly .",
    "preference was given to currently very active fields which combine observations in two or more wavelengths .",
    "1 - main cluster components *    [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while recent morphological studies were carried out mainly with rosat observations , the japanese satellite asca was much used because of its spectral capabilities .",
    "an important parameter determined by x - ray spectra is the gas temperature .",
    "the temperature is typically between 1 and 10 kev being in good agreement with the depth of the potential well .",
    "temperature maps , which are still very coarse due to the limited spatial resolution of asca , show that many clusters are not isothermal ( markevitch 1998 ) .",
    "the temperature distribution is another way to determine the dynamical state of a cluster . as it was shown by hydrodynamic simulations ( schindler & mller 1993 ) the temperature structure shows very clearly the different stages of a merger , e.g. the hot , compressed gas between two subclusters shortly before they collide or the shock waves emerging after the collision as steep temperature gradients .",
    "as not all the ions are completely ionised at these temperatures line emission can be observed . in most of the clusters",
    "fe lines are visible , but sometimes also si and other elements are detectable . the metallicities ( calculated from the fe lines ) are typically in the range between 0.2 and 0.5 in solar units ( e.g. mushotzky & loewenstein 1997 ; tsuru et al . 1997 ; fukazawa et al .",
    "obviously , the gas can not be purely of primordial origin but must have been enriched by nucleosynthesis processes in cluster galaxies .",
    "no ( strong ) evolution of the metallicities with time has been found out to a redshift of 1 ( schindler 1999 ) .",
    "this result is in agreement with optical observations of cluster galaxy evolution ( e.g. stanford et al . 1998 ) and theoretical models ( martinelli et al . 1999 ) , which both find no metal enrichment of the intra - cluster medium for redshifts smaller than 1 , i.e. the enrichment must take place relatively early . a famous example for a high - redshift and high - metallicity cluster is the cluster axj2019 + 112 at a redshift of @xmath2 , which has a puzzling iron abundance of more than the solar value ( hattori et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "x - ray observations provide another method the measure the cluster mass . with the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "the mass can be estimated simply from the temperature profile and the gas density profile ( for applications of this method on a large sample of clusters see e.g. arnaud & evrard 1999 ; ettori & fabian 1999 ) . numerical simulations showed that hydrostatic equilibrium is a good assumption to get reasonable mass estimates in roughly relaxed clusters ( evrard et al . 1996 ; schindler 1996 ) .",
    "masses for typical clusters are of the order of @xmath3 when measured out to the virial radius .",
    "a comparison of the masses determined by the different methods shows that the virial mass and the x - ray mass are in general in agreement , but the lensing mass ( in particular the mass from strong lensing ) is sometimes up to a factor of three higher ( see e.g. the comparison in squires et al . 1996 or schindler et al . 1997 ) . in these comparisons",
    "it is important to take into account that the mass is measured in different volumes : in x - rays the mass is measured in a spherical volume , while the gravitational lensing effect is sensitive to all the mass along the line - of - sight , i.e. it measures the mass in a cylindrical volume around the cluster",
    ". therefore , the measurements can give different results , although they are all correct .",
    "as the measurements for all the methods mentioned here are getting better and the problems of the individual methods ( like e.g. projection effects ) are better understood , it is probable that all the methods are going to converge in the end .    from the x - ray observations also",
    "the mass of the intra - cluster gas can be determined . together with the mass in the galaxies",
    "this yields an average baryon fraction of about 20% . for an @xmath4 universe",
    "this value is at least 3 times larger than allowed by primordial nucleosynthesis  a famous discrepancy termed `` baryon catastrophe '' ( white et al .",
    "the easiest way out of the problem seems now a cosmological model with a low @xmath5 .",
    "a comparison of the gas distribution and the dark matter distribution shows that the gas distribution is generally more extended ( e.g. david et al .",
    "obviously , cluster evolution is not completely a self - similar process , but physical processes taking place in the gas must be taken into account , like e.g. energy input by supernovae , galactic winds or ram - pressure stripping ( see e.g. metzler & evrard 1997 ; cavaliere et al .",
    "as the gas distribution is relatively more extended in less massive clusters ( see schindler 1999 ) these heating processes must be more efficient in less massive clusters .",
    "clusters as the largest bound objects in the universe are very good tracers for large - scale structure .",
    "they can be used for various cosmological tests .",
    "distribution functions like the luminosity function ( e.g. de grandi et al . 1999 ) or the correlation function ( e.g. guzzo et al . 1999 ) preferably of an x - ray selected cluster sample ( i.e. a mass selected sample ) can be used to constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "also correlations between x - ray quantities ( e.g. between the x - ray luminosity , the temperature and the cluster mass ) can be used to test different cosmological models because their relations as well as the evolution of these relations depend on cosmological parameters ( oukbir & blanchard 1992 ; bower 1997 ; cavaliere et al .",
    "1998b , eke et al . 1998",
    "; schindler 1999 ) .",
    "radio emission has been found in many galaxies clusters .",
    "two different kinds of radio emission can be distinguished : diffuse emission and emission associated with galaxies .",
    "the latter one ( see owen & ledlow 1997 for many examples ) can be used to determine the relative motion of the intra - cluster gas and head - tail galaxies by their radio morphology ( odonoghue et al .",
    "1993 ; sijbring & de bruyn 1998 ) .",
    "furthermore , the pressure of the intra - cluster gas can be estimated from the radio lobe expansion into the gas ( e.g. eilek et al .",
    "1984 ; feretti et al . 1990 ) .",
    "observations of the rotation measure of sources in or behind a cluster provide the possibility to determine the cluster magnetic field .",
    "typically values between 0.1 @xmath6 g up to few @xmath6 g are found ( e.g. feretti et al . 1995 ) .    in several clusters",
    "diffuse radio emission could be detected ( e.g. giovannini et al .",
    "if the diffuse emission is located in the central parts and has a roughly spherical shape , it is called radio halo , see e.g. the coma cluster ( giovannini et al .",
    "in other clusters the radio emission is situated in the outer parts and has usually elongated shapes .",
    "these sources are called relics , see e.g. a3667 ( rttgering et al .",
    "although it was previously assumed that the central and non - central sources are different kinds of sources , it is now probable that they have the same origin .",
    "a possible explanation for the emission could be merging of subclusters .",
    "in such mergers turbulence and shocks are produced which can provide the necessary energy to reaccelerate particles and to amplify the magnetic field .",
    "the discovered correlations between the halo size , the radio power , the x - ray luminosity and the gas temperature of the host cluster support this theory : the collision of more massive clusters (= higher x - ray luminosity and higher gas temperature ) would provide more energy for the radio halo .    finally , a very exciting field , which uses a combination of radio and x - ray observations , is the distance determination by the sunyaev - zeldovich effect ( sunyaev & zeldovich 1972 ) . when photons of the cosmic microwave background pass through the hot gas of a cluster , they are scattered to slightly higher energies , i.e. inverse compton scattering .",
    "that means the blackbody spectrum of the cmb appears slightly shifted when observed in direction of a cluster .",
    "this results in an increment or a decrement depending on what side of the blackbody spectrum the observations are done .",
    "this in- or decrement is proportional to the intra - cluster gas density , while the x - ray emission is proportional to the square of the density .",
    "these two different dependences allow to estimate the physical size of the cluster , while the angular size of the cluster can be measured easily .",
    "the combination of physical and angular size provides a direct measurement of the distance of the cluster .",
    "the problem of this method is that the physical size is measured along the line - of - sight , while the angular size is measured perpendicular to the line - of - sight , i.e. if the cluster is elongated the derived distance is wrong . to avoid",
    "this problem currently whole samples of clusters are measured ( e.g. carlstrom et al .",
    "1999 ) , because for many clusters this effect is expected to average out .",
    "furthermore , the sunyaev - zeldovich effect can also be used to study the distribution of the intra - cluster gas . for",
    "a recent review on the sunyaev - zeldovich effect see birkinshaw ( 1999 ) .",
    "the study of clusters of galaxies became a very active field in recent years through the development of new techniques ( e.g. gravitational lensing ) and powerful instruments ( e.g. rosat , hst ) .",
    "observations in all wavelengths and the comparison with theory taught us a lot about cluster components , cluster dynamics and the physics in clusters .",
    "a particularly interesting aspect has opened up in the last years with the use of clusters as probes for cosmology .",
    "the new instruments , e.g. vlt , xmm , chandra and planck , will certainly make cosmology with clusters an even more fascinating field in the future .",
