    "increasing interest in @xmath0 theory of gravity ( see @xcite for a recent review ) initiates to probe deeply into it and to explore its merits - demerits from different angles .",
    "cosmological consequences of @xmath0 theory of gravity have been explored @xcite taking into account different sets of field equations which appear through the metric variation and palatini variation formalisms .",
    "although , both set of field equations lead to late time cosmic acceleration without the requirement of dark energy in the form of scalar fields , different results have emerged following these two different techniques . for example , unification of early inflation and late time acceleration @xcite on one hand , and violent instability @xcite , cosmologically non - viability @xcite , big bang nucleosynthesis and fifth - force constraints altogether @xcite , on the other , are the outcome of metric formalism . on the contrary , no instability appears as such in palatini formalism @xcite and it leads to correct newtonian limit @xcite , while curvature corrections are found to induce effective pressure gradients which create problem in the formation of large - scale structure @xcite .",
    "further , even density perturbation in the two techniques , produce different results @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been shown that under conformal transformation the two formalisms are the same dynamically @xcite and also are equivalent for a large class of theories @xcite . despite such contrasting results on one hand and equivalence of the two formalisms on the other , at the end",
    "it is required to choose some particular form of @xmath0 out of indefinitely many .",
    "this is only possible by imposing noether symmetry . in the present work",
    "we discuss this issue in the metric variation formalism . + noether symmetry when applied for the first time in scalar - tensor theory of gravity @xcite , the idea was to find a form of the potential that might give rise to a cyclic co - ordinate and hence a conserved current .",
    "that is , out of indefinitely many choice of the potential , noether symmetry selects one , corresponding to which there exists a cyclic coordinate that ca nt be found a - priori through inspection . in the robertson - walker background metric the exponential form of the potential thus found was rather encouraging , because it could trigger inflation in the early universe .",
    "since then , it has been applied in nonminimally coupled scalar - tensor theory of gravity both in the background of isotropic and several anisotropic models @xcite , together with nonminimally coupled scalar - tensor theory in the presence of @xmath3 term in the action @xcite and recently , to classify different dark energy models @xcite .",
    "+ to explore noether symmetry , it is first required to express the action in canonical form , which is possible by introducing auxiliary variable in higher order theory of gravity .",
    "this has been attempted by several authors @xcite for @xmath0 theory of gravity , treating @xmath1 as a constraint in the robertson - walker minisuperspace model . in the process",
    ", the lagrangian is spanned by a set of configuration space variables @xmath8 , i.e. , @xmath2 is treated as an auxiliary variable and the result is @xmath4 in the vacuum and matter dominated era .",
    "such a form of @xmath0 produces @xmath9 instead of the standard @xmath10 in the radiation dominated era @xcite .",
    "this creates problem in explaining bbn , since universe expands at a much faster rate than the standard friedmann model .",
    "further , it has been shown that @xcite under appropriate choice of variable @xmath11 , required for canonical quantization of higher order theory of gravity in the robertson - walker metric @xcite , @xmath12 becomes cyclic for @xmath13 .",
    "it means @xmath14 has inbuilt noether symmetry for @xmath0 theory in vacuum or in matter dominated era .",
    "now , scalar field appears naturally along with higher order curvature invariant terms in the weak energy limit of string theories @xcite , @xmath15-dimensional brane world effective action @xcite , supergravity theories @xcite and in the chern - simons gravitational theories @xcite .",
    "therefore , adding more degrees of freedom in the form of a scalar field , @xmath12 is no longer cyclic for @xmath13 and situation might improve , yielding a better form of @xmath0 to explain presently available cosmological data .",
    "additionally , the symmetry already obtained for @xmath16 , in the presence of a scalar field @xcite must be reproduced , if canonization treating @xmath2 as an auxiliary variable is correct .",
    "+ higher order theory of gravity may be expressed in canonical form choosing other auxiliary variables too , different from @xmath2 .",
    "all lead to correct classical field equations but different quantum dynamics .",
    "horowitz @xcite suggested to choose auxiliary variable as the derivative of the action with respect to the highest derivative present in the action , i.e. , as @xmath17 .",
    "this suggestion is flawed , since in that case auxiliary variable may be introduced even in linear theory as shown by pollock @xcite leading to completely wrong quantum dynamics .",
    "later , in a series of works @xcite it was suggested that auxiliary variable should be introduced following the prescription of horowitz @xcite only after removing appropriate total derivative terms from the action . following this technique , we found noether symmetry for @xmath18 , @xmath2 being non - minimally coupled to a scalar field @xcite .",
    "thus our intention is to see if same result @xcite is reproduced taking @xmath2 as an auxiliary variable , and if noether symmetry at all exists for other form of action .",
    "+ thus in the following section 2 , we take up a theory of gravity consisting of scalar field being nonminimally coupled with @xmath0 , follow the usual technique of finding noether symmetry @xcite to end up with the result that noether symmetry for @xmath19 is obscure . in section 3 ,",
    "following the same technique @xcite , for a nonminimally coupled scalar - tensor theory of gravity along with @xmath0 term we obtain the same result that @xmath19 is impossible .",
    "this is surprising , since , as already mentioned , we have explored noether symmetry for the same action , with @xmath16 and the brans - dicke coupling parameter @xmath20 , in the conformally flat robertson - walker metric @xcite . in doing so , we have used an auxiliary variable @xmath21 , different from @xmath2 , and the lagrangian was spanned by the set of configuration space variables ( @xmath22 ) , instead .",
    "thus , the absence of noether symmetry in both the cases automatically raises doubt about the technique of treating @xmath1 , as a constraint of the theory . to check",
    "if indeed the technique is flawed , in section 4 , we take up a set of anisotropic models , which also increases the configuration space variables ( @xmath23 ) , to explore noether symmetry of @xmath0 theory in vacuum . here",
    "again we find that @xmath0 does not admit any nonlinear form .",
    "thus we conclude that symmetry in isotropic space - time obtained for @xmath24 in vacuum and matter dominated era , was an accident , since it makes @xmath25 cyclic , but the technique @xcite is flawed , and it is not possible to explore noether symmetry of @xmath0 theory of gravity , in general .",
    "+ the next question that automatically arises ,  is it possible to find an integral of motion in general for @xmath0 theory of gravity being coupled with a scalar field , including a linear term in addition ? \" .",
    "the answer is yes and already appears in the literature @xcite , where a general conserved current in connection with a general higher order theory of gravity coupled with a dilatonic scalar has been explored in a metric independent way . in section 5 ,",
    "we briefly discuss the technique of finding the same and as an example , show how to use such conserved current to find solutions in the context of cosmology .",
    "we have given a simple solution of the scale factor directly for the action containing @xmath24 being added to a linear term ( @xmath26 ) along with a scalar field @xmath27 , in the robertson - walker metric , both in radiation and matter dominated era .",
    "it produces friedmann type solution in the radiation era and a coasting solution in the matter era , which fits snia data perfectly although early deceleration remains absent creating problem in structure formation .",
    "finally , we end up with conclusions .",
    "here , we start with the following action , in which @xmath0 is non - minimally coupled to a scalar field as ,    s = d^4 x.in the robertson - walker line element ,    ds^2 = -dt^2+a^2 ,    r = 6(++).as already mentioned , the technique @xcite under discussion is to treat @xmath28 as a constraint and to introduce it in the action via a lagrange multiplier @xmath29 as ,    s = d^4 x , and to vary the action with respect to @xmath2 , which yields ,    = h()f_,r(r).next step is to substitute the form of @xmath29 into the above action .",
    "after integration by parts to get rid of the appropriate surface term , the action is automatically expressed in the following non - degenerate canonical form , that can be checked by calculating the determinant of the hessian @xmath30 .",
    "thus ,    s = dt.we now move straight into the process of finding a non - linear form of @xmath0 , along with @xmath31 and @xmath32 , by imposing noether symmetry , @xmath33 where , @xmath34 is the vector field and @xmath35 is the point lagrangian .",
    "so , as usual , let us equate the coefficients of @xmath36 and the terms independent of them , separately to zero to get the following seven equations respectively .",
    "@xmath37f_{,rr } + [ h'(2\\alpha+a\\alpha_{,a})+2h\\alpha'+a(h''\\gamma+h'\\gamma')]f_{,r}-\\frac{1}{6}a^2w\\gamma_{,a}=0.\\\\ & 6h\\alpha'f_{,rr}+6h'\\alpha_{,r}f_{,r } = wa\\gamma_{,r}.\\\\ & \\beta h a f_{,rrr}+[2h\\alpha+ha\\alpha_{,a}+ha\\beta_{,r}+h'a\\gamma]f_{,rr}+(2h\\alpha_{,r}+h'a\\gamma_{,r})f_{,r}=0.\\\\ & \\beta ha[6k - a^2r]f_{,rr } + a^2(f - r f_{,r})(3\\alpha h + \\gamma a h')+6kf_{,r}(\\alpha h + \\gamma a h')-a^2(3\\alpha v + \\gamma a v ' ) = 0.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    in the above set of equations and everywhere else dash ( @xmath38 ) represents derivative with respect to @xmath27 . in the following subsection ,",
    "we try to explore noether symmetry from the above set of equations ( 7 ) through ( 13 ) .      since , we are only interested in a non - linear form of @xmath0 , i.e. , @xmath19 , so equation ( 8) implies @xmath39 , i.e. , @xmath40 . hence , equation ( 11 )",
    "leads to two distinct cases , which we explore underneath in the subsubsections ( 2.1.1 ) and ( 2.1.2 ) .",
    "+      the first case that arises in view of equation ( 11 ) is , @xmath41 which can be integrated to yield f_,r = + m , i.e.,= ( f_,r - m).where , @xmath42 is clearly a constant , since @xmath43 , is a function of @xmath2 only .",
    "hence , substituting this form of @xmath44 and @xmath45 in equation ( 9 ) we obtain , @xmath46 which holds only under the following conditions , @xmath47 @xmath48 these pair of equations relate @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "in fact using @xmath52 , equation @xmath53 takes the form ( note , @xmath54 , for which @xmath27 turns out to be a lagrange multiplier , and so we omit this case ) , @xmath55 finally , equations @xmath52 and @xmath56 imply , @xmath57 since , the right hand side of @xmath58 is a function of @xmath27 only , so @xmath50 must have the separable form , @xmath59 , and thus , _ 2 ^ 2 = 8 mhandw = _ 2^2.now using equations ( 14 ) and ( 15 ) , one can express equation ( 7 ) as , ( + a _ , a)_3 f_,rr + _ 1,a_2 f_,r^2 + _ 2 f_,r = 0.where , @xmath60 .",

    "thus we switch over to the following subcase . + * subcase-2 * + @xmath68 which is trivial , or , @xmath69 which is again trivial .",

    "but then equations ( 27 ) and ( 28 ) are satisfied simultaneously , for @xmath65 , which makes @xmath89 and satisfies equation ( 30 ) trivially keeping the form of @xmath0 obscure .",
    "summarily , we find that , the noether equations ( 7 ) through ( 13 ) can not be solved for a nonlinear form of @xmath0 and so we fail to extract noether symmetry , at least following the technique of treating @xmath1 to be a constraint of the theory .",

    "the field equation for higher order theory of gravity is ,    f,_rr_-f g_+ ( f,_r)^ ; _ ;   g_-(f,_r ) _ ; ; = 0 .trace of which yields ,    r f,_r+3(f,_r)^;_;-2f = 0.thus , @xmath2 can not be zero or constant , which implies birkhoff s theorem that schwarzschild s solution is the unique spherically symmetric vacuum solution does not hold for @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "in fact , substituting the above result that @xmath2 is a constant in equation ( 79 ) , one obtains    f_,rr = 0,which contradicts the starting assumption that @xmath19 .",
    "thus , we observe that noether symmetry of @xmath0 theory of gravity fails to yield a non - linear form of @xmath0 in the anisotropic models under consideration .",
    "thus , despite rigorous calculation , noether symmetry of @xmath0 theory of gravity remains obscure .",
    "this is not a problem whatsoever , since nature may not allow such additional symmetry .",
    "problem is , noether symmetry for @xmath90 already exists @xcite and the present technique @xcite fails to reproduce it .",
    "hence , fixing @xmath0 a - priori and expressing the canonical form of the lagrangian using auxiliary variable @xmath21 @xcite , noether symmetry may be realized . on the other hand , since there is no way to find a canonical point lagrangian for @xmath0 theory of gravity , other than the technique under consideration @xcite , hence at this end we conclude that noether symmetry of @xmath0 theory of gravity is obscure and so there is no way to find a form of @xmath0 , other than choosing it arbitrarily .",
    "noether symmetry not only fixes the form of a parameter but also yields an integral of motion leading to a cyclic variable and thus helps in finding some exact solutions of apparently non - tractable field equations .",
    "thus absence of noether symmetry for @xmath0 gravity makes it practically impossible to solve the field equations even if a form of @xmath0 is put in by hand . in this section",
    "we show that the situation is not as bad as it appears , because a general ( non - noether ) conserved current exists for higher order theory of gravity @xcite . for the purpose , here we take up action ( 31 ) in addition to a matter lagrangian @xmath143 , to briefly illustrate the existence of the said integral of motion , as    a =  d^4x .",
    "field equations corresponding to the above action under metric variation method are ,    @xmath144 + b = t_.    r f+2^;_;+^,_,-v ( ) = 0 .",
    "the trace of the field equation ( 88 ) is , r f-3f^;_;-^,_,-2v -b[r(f,_r)+3(f,_r)^;_;-2f ] = -t^_. combining equations ( 89 ) and ( 90 ) it has been shown @xcite that under the following condition ,    b [ r(f,_r ) + 3(f,_r)^;_;-2f ] =  t^ _ + ( )  , the above action ( 87 ) carries a conserved current    j^_;=[(3f^2 + 2f ) ^^ ; ] _ ; = 0 ,    which in the case of homogeneous cosmology , takes the following simplified form ,    = c ,    where , @xmath145 is a non - vanishing constant and @xmath146 is the determinant of the metric .",
    "thus , a general conserved current exists for higher order theory of gravity , without even fixing the forms of the parameters involved , which lies beyond the scope of noether symmetry , since it is true for the theory of gravitation in general .",
    "it might still appear impossible to solve the cosmological field equations using the conserved current ( 93 ) .",
    "however , it has been expatiated in a recent letter @xcite , that it may be useful to solve the field equations taking @xmath90 . here , just to cite another example we try the same for @xmath24 .",
    "remember that @xmath24 yields a noether symmetry in the robertson - walker space - time only in the absence of a linear term and the dilatonic sector .",
    "however , here we are presenting a solution corresponding to an action containing a linear term being non - minimally coupled to a scalar field in the presence of @xmath24 . in the robertson - walker space time",
    ", we are required to solve the four available equations , for @xmath147 and @xmath32 .",
    "thus one has to make yet another assumption . to handle the equations comfortably ,",
    "we therefore split the condition ( 91 ) into two , assuming @xmath148 , as    b [ r f,_r + 3(f,_r)^;_;-2f ] =  t^ _ ,    v = f^2 ,    where , @xmath29 is a constant .",
    "so finally , in the case of homogeneous cosmology , we need to solve following set of five equations , @xmath149 = \\frac{\\kappa}{2}~t^{\\mu}_{\\mu } ,   \\\\ & v = \\lambda f^2,\\\\ & r f-3 \\box f -\\omega\\phi^{,\\mu}\\phi_{,\\mu}-2v=0 , \\\\ & r f'+2\\omega\\box\\phi+\\omega'\\phi^{,\\mu}\\phi_{,\\mu}-v'(\\phi ) = 0,\\\\ & \\sqrt{-g\\left(3f'^2 + 2f~\\omega\\right)}\\;\\;\\dot \\phi = c.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now for @xmath24 , f_,r = -[(r + r)f_,rr + r^2 f_,rrr ] = - ,    and so equation ( 96 ) reduces to ,    = -  t^_.    taking baryonic and non - baryonic dark matter in the energy momentum tensor , one can solve the above equation ( 102 ) , both in the radiation and matter dominated era in the flat case @xmath88 . in the radiation dominated era , taking @xmath150 , the trace of the energy momentum tensor @xmath151 vanishes and equation ( 102 ) , gets solved to yield @xmath152 .",
    "this is a brilliant feature of higher order theory of gravity , that despite being tightly coupled to the scalar field it still produces friedmann type solution in the radiation era keeping standard big - bang - nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) unchanged .",
    "note that we are required to find @xmath153 and @xmath154 , in view of the four equations ( 97 ) through ( 100 ) , which although we are not attempting , may be found in principle , since explicit form of @xmath2 is now known . in the matter dominated era , on the other end , @xmath155 and the trace of the energy momentum tensor is simply @xmath156 , with @xmath157 , @xmath158 being the present matter density of the universe .",
    "the only solution that we could find for equation ( 102 ) is @xmath159 , provided the condition @xmath160 holds .",
    "however , such a coasting solution although fits snia data perfectly as illustrated in figure - i , is ruled out , since it does not admit structure formation . in our earlier work @xcite , we found that @xmath14 yields @xmath9 in the radiation era , which creates problem in explaining bbn and its solution in the matter dominated era , although admits early deceleration and late time acceleration , does not fit with the hubble parameter versus red - shift - standard model data .",
    "therefore , we have tried here to incorporate a linear term in the action , being coupled with a dilatonic sector .",
    "it shows , despite improvement in radiation era , it does not admit experimental data in the matter dominated era .",
    "hence , @xmath14 term is likely to be ruled out .",
    "both the metric and palatini variation methods have vices and virtues and it is a matter of taste to adopt one .",
    "however at the end one requires a form of @xmath0 , any nonlinear form of which makes field equations extremely difficult to solve .",
    "noether symmetry not only fixes a form out of indefinitely many , but also yields an integral of motion which makes field equations somewhat tractable .",
    "for such purpose one requires a canonical point lagrangian .",
    "the only technique known so far to express @xmath0 in such a form is to introduce @xmath1 as a constraint in robertson - walker metric , which gives correct field equations , in view of the auxiliary variable @xmath2 . following this technique , noether symmetry yields @xmath24 both in vacuum and matter dominated era .",
    "although such a form is reasonably good in the early universe , suffers from the disease that it does not produce standard friedmann radiation era @xcite . in anticipation",
    "that a linear term in addition could have cured the disease , here we have enlarged the configuration space by adding a scalar field .",
    "rigorous and detailed calculation shows that noether symmetry remains obscure for @xmath19 .",
    "we have also attempted to find noether symmetry for pure @xmath0 gravity in the background of some anisotropic models and ended up with the same result .",
    "nature might not allow additional symmetry , but the problem is that noether symmetry for a scalar - tensor theory of gravity being coupled with @xmath161 , already exists in the literature @xcite , while the present technique fails to reproduce the same .",
    "this raises doubt about the technique @xcite under consideration .",
    "+ obviously , one should ask  how come the technique then yields @xmath24 in vacuum and matter dominated era ? \" . the answer has been given in a recent work @xcite , where it has been shown that under appropriate choice of co",
    "- ordinate @xmath162 , an action containing @xmath14 in vacuum and in the matter dominated era , makes the variable @xmath12 cyclic .",
    "thus , the symmetry obtained in robertson - walker space - time yielding @xmath24 , is due to the very speciality of the isotropic and homogeneous space - time and so is a mere accident . since there is no way to find a canonical point lagrangian for @xmath0 theory of gravity , other than the one under consideration , so we conclude that such a symmetry is obscure for a general @xmath0 gravity . + it therefore appears that there is practically no way to handle @xmath0 theory of gravity .",
    "however , the situation is not as bad , since a scalar - tensor theory of gravity in the presence of @xmath0 , indeed carries a general conserved current @xcite , which is independent of the metric and also on the forms of parameters involved , viz . , @xmath0 , @xmath163 , @xmath164 and @xmath32 . here in section ( 5 )",
    ", we have briefly presented the conserved current and cited an example taking @xmath24 , to understand its use in finding solutions for higher order curvature invariant terms .",
    "the presence of a linear term in the action modifies the solution in the radiation era to the standard friedmann type ( @xmath152 ) .",
    "thus bbn remains unaltered , which is of - course a brilliant result . on the other hand matter",
    "dominated era admits only a coasting solution in the form @xmath165 , which although fits snia data perfectly , does not allow a transition from early deceleration and so @xmath14 is not a good choice to explain late time cosmological observations .",
