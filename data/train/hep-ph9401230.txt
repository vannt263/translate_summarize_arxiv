    "from the pioneering work by weinberg [ 1 ] on phenomenological lagrangians , a lot of work has been devoted to this field .",
    "specially remarkable was the work by gasser and leutwyler [ 2 ] where this technique was applied , at the one - loop level , to the description of the low - energy behavior of the nambu - goldstone bosons ( pions ) corresponding to the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry of hadron interactions , i.e. the so - called chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath3pt ) .",
    "more recently , the phenomenological lagrangian approach has also been used in the context of the symmetry breaking sector of standard model and , in particular , it was applied to the scattering of the longitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons [ 3 ] .    in spite of the great phenomenological success of @xmath3pt , some problems still must be solved .",
    "typically @xmath3pt computations are done to the one - loop level .",
    "this fact puts strong limitations to the region of applicability of @xmath3pt which is restricted to the very low - energy regime since , at higher energies , conflicts with unitarity appear [ 4 ] .",
    "several methods have been proposed in the literature to improve the unitarity behavior of @xmath3pt like the introduction of new fields corresponding to resonances [ 5 ] , the pad approximants [ 4 ] , the inverse amplitude method [ 6 ] etc .",
    "more recently it was suggested that it is possible to define a sensible large @xmath0 approach to @xmath3pt ( @xmath0 being the number of nambu - goldstone bosons ) which is consistent in principle at any energy . in particular ,",
    "it was shown in [ 7 ] how this approach can be used to compute and renormalize the pion scattering amplitude and in [ 8 ] it was used to study the @xmath4 reaction .",
    "more recently , some of the results of [ 7 ] were reobtained in [ 9 ] by using a different method .    in this work we pursuit this issue further as follows",
    ": first we show a functional computation of the effective action for pions in the model @xmath1 to the order of @xmath5 which is non - local . from this effective action",
    "we obtain the elastic scattering amplitude for pions .",
    "we use this result to make a one parameter fit of the experimental data corresponding to the @xmath2 channel .",
    "then we obtain the mass functional for the skyrmion from the large @xmath0 effective action .",
    "we arrive to the conclusion that the skyrmion is not stable in the many pion approximation considered here and we finish by discussing which could be the reasons for that and giving the main conclusions of our work .",
    "to define the large @xmath0 limit of @xmath3pt we start from the two - flavor chiral symmetry group @xmath6 .",
    "then we use the equivalence of the coset spaces @xmath7 to extend this symmetry pattern to @xmath8 so that @xmath0 can be understood as the number of nambu - goldstone bosons ( ngb ) or pions .",
    "the fields describing these ngb can be chosen as arbitrary coordinates on the coset manifold @xmath9 .",
    "the most general @xmath10 invariant lagrangian can be obtained as a derivative expansion which is covariant respect to both , the space - time and the @xmath9 coordinates .",
    "the lowest order is the well known non - linear sigma model lagrangian given by : @xmath11 in our computations we will select the standard coordinates @xmath12 where @xmath13 being @xmath14 the squared sphere radius and @xmath15 .",
    "the above lagrangian gives rise not only to the kinetic term but also to interacting terms with arbitrary even number of pions .",
    "these two - derivative interactions produce some difficulties in the quantum theory which have been largely discussed in the literature [ 10 ] . from the path integral point of view",
    ", the proper quantization prescription is obtained by defining the path integral measure as @xmath16 $ ] which is @xmath10 invariant provided @xmath17 is the @xmath9 metric determinant .",
    "this factor gives an extra contribution to the non - linear sigma model lagrangian proportional to @xmath18 .",
    "as it is well known , one can deal with this new term by using dimensional regularization [ 11 ] . in this case",
    "one work in a @xmath19 dimensional space - time so that the regularized classical lagrangian still is @xmath10 invariant and , in addition , the measure term can be ignored as a consequence of the rule @xmath20 or equivalently @xmath21 . in the following",
    "we will work always in this regularization scheme and hence we will neglect completely the measure term ( for a recent discussion about regularization methods in @xmath22pt see [ 12 ] ) .    in order to derive the regularized large @xmath0 effective action from the above non - linear sigma model",
    "we will extend a technique that has already been used in the case of the linear theory [ 13 ] .",
    "first we introduce an auxiliary vector field @xmath23 ( in contrast with the @xmath24 case where an auxiliary scalar field has to be introduced ) .",
    "then we consider the new modified lagrangian for the non - linear sigma model :    @xmath25    as there is not any kinetic term for the @xmath26 field in this lagrangian and it is quadratic in this field , a simple gaussian integration makes possible to integrate out this auxiliary field in such a way that the original lagrangian is recovered so that , the pion green functions obtained from the lagrangians in eq.1 and eq.2 are the same . however , the new lagrangian symplifies the computation of the @xmath0 factors for any given feynman diagram .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the lagrangian in eq.2 does not produce pion self - interactions but @xmath26 mediated pion interactions .",
    "the @xmath26 propagator is just a constant of the order @xmath5 and we have a @xmath27 vertex of the order one , a @xmath28 vertex of the order @xmath5 , a @xmath29 vertex of the order @xmath30 etc .",
    "therefore , the most general pion green function can be obtained by attaching the external pions in all possible ways to the @xmath26 legs of the most general @xmath26 green function ( see fig 1.a for an example ) .",
    "the most general connected @xmath26 green function ( represented in fig.1 by a black blob ) will contain loops both of pions and @xmath26 s and in general can be written in terms of @xmath26 green functions containing only pions loops ( represented in fig.1 by a dashed blob ) attached to @xmath26 lines forming loops ( see fig.1b ) .",
    "in addition , it is not difficult to realize that the dashed @xmath26 functions are as much of the order of @xmath0 ( see fig.1c ) .",
    "therefore , taking into account that the @xmath26 propagators are of the order of @xmath5 we conclude that , to leading order in the @xmath5 expansion , black @xmath26 green functions are equal to the dashed @xmath26 green functions or , in other words , to leading order we do not have to consider diagrams with @xmath26 loops ( see fig.1d ) .    thus in the large @xmath0 limit we just need to compute the generating functional for the 1pi @xmath26 green functions and then couple the pions to the external @xmath26 legs at the tree level",
    ". moreover , we are interested only in the two point and the four point pion green functions which are of the order of @xmath31 and @xmath5 respectively .",
    "this means that we need to consider only one point and two point @xmath26 functions . in this case",
    "it is not difficult to see that the only vertex that must be considered is @xmath27 since the others necessarily produce pion loops with only one vertex .",
    "however this kind of loop vanishes because our pions are massless and we are using dimensional regularization . in principle , there could be also a contribution of the order of @xmath5 to the two - pion function coming from the one leg @xmath26 diagram with one @xmath26 loop inside .",
    "nevertheless , this diagram is proportional to the external @xmath26 momentum so that it does not contribute to the two - pion function .",
    "thus , the @xmath26 1pi generating functional ( or @xmath26 effective action ) that we have to compute can be written as : @xmath32=i\\int d^nx(-\\frac{1}{2}nf^2b^2)+\\log \\int[d\\pi]\\exp{i\\tilde s[\\pi , b]}\\ ] ] where : @xmath33= \\int d^nx ( -\\frac{1}{2}\\pi_a\\box \\pi^a+b_{\\mu}\\pi_a \\partial^{\\mu}\\pi^a)\\ ] ] as the functional integral is quadratic in the pion field it can be computed exactly by the use of standard methods .",
    "we introduce the operator : @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the solution of the equation of motion @xmath36 and therefore we can write : @xmath37=\\int d^nx(-\\frac{1}{2}nf^2b^2)+ \\tilde s[\\bar \\pi , b]+\\frac{i}{2}tr\\log k\\ ] ] as usual the trace of the @xmath38 operator is expanded as : @xmath39 as it was mentioned before , we only need to compute the first two terms of this sum corresponding to the one and two points @xmath26 functions respectively .",
    "in addition , the one point function vanishes since it is proportional to a tadpole integral .",
    "therefore , the only contribution to the @xmath26 effective action is : @xmath40 so that , by neglecting the no @xmath26-leg contribution and terms with more than two legs we find : @xmath41=-\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^nxd^nyb_{\\mu}(x ) \\gamma^{\\mu\\nu}(x , y)b_{\\nu}(y)\\ ] ] where : @xmath42 and as usual @xmath43 and @xmath44 is an arbitrary dimensional scale .",
    "next we add to this action the coupling with the external pions @xmath45 : @xmath46=\\int d^4x b_{\\mu}\\pi_a\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi^a+\\gamma_{eff}[b]\\ ] ] now we use this action to obtain the @xmath26 field as a functional of the @xmath47 field through the corresponding equation of motion : @xmath48 the solution to this equation can be written as : @xmath49 the effective action for pions can be written as : @xmath50=\\int d^4x(\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\pi_a\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi^a + \\pi_a\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi^a\\bar b_{\\mu } -\\frac{1}{2}\\int d^4y\\bar b_{\\mu}(x)\\gamma^{\\mu\\nu}(x , y)\\bar   b_{\\nu}(y ) ) \\ ] ] by computing the inverse of the @xmath51 operator appearing in eq.10 we finally obtain : @xmath52&=&\\int d^4x \\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{\\mu}\\pi_a\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi^a   \\\\ \\nonumber & + & \\frac{1}{8nf^2}\\int d^4x d^4y \\pi^2(x)\\pi^2(y ) \\int % % following line can not be broken before 80 char \\frac{d^4q}{(2\\pi)^4}e^{-iq(x - y)}\\frac{q^2}{1-\\frac{q^2}{2(4\\pi)^2f^2}(n_{\\epsilon } + 2+\\log\\frac{\\mu^2}{-q^2 } ) }   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   & + & o(1/n^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the denominator must be understood as the corresponding formal geometric series .",
    "once the regularized effective action for pions has been obtained in the large @xmath0 limit we have to deal with the renormalization of this result .",
    "as the kinetic term of this effective action is just the classical one , no renormalization of the pion wave function is needed i.e. @xmath53 . however , in the effective action we find four pion interaction terms which are divergent and proportional to arbitrary high even powers of the momenta .",
    "this of course reveals the well known fact that the non - linear sigma model is not renormalizable in the standard sense .",
    "nevertheless , we can absorb all the divergences by adding to the original lagrangian in eq.1 an infinite set of new counter terms that can be chosen for example as : @xmath54 apart from these , on could also in priciple to introduce many other terms .",
    "however , here we will adopt the philosophy of introducing only a minimal set of terms just to absorb the divergences appearing in the non - linear sigma model to leading order in the @xmath5 expansion .",
    "now , following similar steps as in [ 7 ] , it is straightforward to obtain the renormalized pion effective action : @xmath52 & = & \\int d^4x \\frac{1}{2 } \\partial_{\\mu}\\pi_a\\partial^{\\mu}\\pi^a   \\\\",

    "\\nonumber   & + & o(1/n^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the generating function for the renormalized coupling constants @xmath56 at the scale @xmath44 : @xmath57 where by definition @xmath58 for every @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath53 , the renormalization group equation followed by the pion effective action is : @xmath59=0\\ ] ] where @xmath60 . from this equation",
    "we can obtain very easily the renormalization group equation for @xmath55 which can be integrated to give the evolution equation : @xmath61 by using this equation and eq.18 it is very easy to get the evolution equations for all the renormalized coupling constants @xmath56 . again because @xmath53 and the fact that pions continue being massless we can read very easily the elastic pion scattering amplitude from eq.17 recovering the result of [ 7 ] ( one missing factor @xmath62 in this reference has been corrected here ) : @xmath63 where : @xmath64 note that at low energies this @xmath65 function behaves as @xmath66 and this fact is important for two reasons .",
    "first , we realize that it is compatible with the low energy theorems which state that it must go in this limit as @xmath67 ( in the chiral limit that we are considering here ) .",
    "second we can use this low - energy theorems to set the constant @xmath68 in terms of the pion decay constant @xmath69 as @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "in addition to this scattering amplitude , there is another important object that can be obtained from the effective action in eq.17 . for static pion field configurations @xmath72",
    "the energy density is given by minus the effective lagrangian i.e. @xmath73 which can be read off from eq.17 .",
    "therefore , the mass functional or , equivalently , the total energy of the configuration can be written as : @xmath74=\\int d\\vec x(\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_i \\pi_a \\partial^i \\pi^a + \\frac{1}{8nf^2}\\pi^2[\\frac{-g^r(\\nabla ; \\mu)\\nabla } { 1-\\frac{1}{2(4\\pi)^2f^2}g^r(\\nabla;\\mu ) \\log(\\frac{\\mu^2}{-\\nabla})\\nabla}](\\pi^2)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the meaning of this non - local mass functional is given by the appropriate fourier transform .    in order to use eq.22 or eq.23 to do phenomenology",
    "we need to define the generating function @xmath55 or , in other words , the infinite number of renormalized couplings constants @xmath56 .",
    "a typical example is the linear sigma model . in this case",
    ", the appropriate choice is : @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the renormalized coupling constant of the linear sigma model computed in the large @xmath0 limit [ 14 ] . with this definition , eq.22 and",
    "eq.20 provide the corresponding well known scattering amplitude and evolution equation for @xmath77 .",
    "in addition , the amplitude in eq.22 has a pole in the second riemann sheet that has to be understood as the physical scalar resonance appearing in the linear sigma model i.e. the higgs resonance .",
    "( see [ 14 ] and [ 15 ] for a discussion on this point ) .",
    "however , the @xmath10 linear sigma model is not the theory that reproduces the hadron interactions at low energies . in principle",
    ", there are two possible approaches for the determination of the renormalized coupling constants appearing in the pion effective action of eq.17 . from the theoretical point of view one could try to compute these parameters from a more fundamental theory of strong interactions like qcd . from the phenomenological point of view",
    ", one can try to fit these constants from the experiment , for example the low - energy pion scattering data .",
    "as the theoretical computation seems to be quite involved , it is worth to make the phenomenological determination of the couplings first in order to test the quality of the whole @xmath0 approach to this case .",
    "using eq.22 to fit the experimental pion scattering data requires to face the fact of having an infinite number of parameters i.e. the scale @xmath44 and the values of the renormalized coupling constants @xmath56 at the scale @xmath44 .",
    "however one can solve this problem in a easy way just by considering only particular cases where all the coupling constants but a finite set @xmath78 , @xmath79 vanish at some scale @xmath44 .",
    "these models are defined just by a finite number of parameters ( @xmath44 and the @xmath80 coupling constants renormalized at this scale ) and therefore can be used to fit the experimental data . in particular",
    ", one can consider the extremal case of having all the renormalized couplings equal to zero at some scale @xmath44 i.e. @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "the model so obtained has only one parameter ( the @xmath44 scale ) and it can be considered in some sense as the non - linear sigma model renormalized at the leading order of the @xmath5 expansion .    of course",
    ", it could happen that the underlying theory ( say qcd ) were not of this type .",
    "however this would not be a serious problem at very low energies because , for natural values of the renormalized coupling constants and the renormalization scale @xmath44 , only the very first terms of the generating function @xmath55 series in eq.18 contribute to the effective action and the scattering amplitude .",
    "however , at higher energies the effect of the infinite set of couplings constants , when different from zero , could be important .",
    "for example , they can conspire to give rise to resonances which appear as poles in the second riemann sheet of the partial waves amplitudes as it happens in the linear sigma model .",
    "of course , in this case the value of the couplings can also be obtained from the underlying theory or by making extra assumptions on the behavior of the amplitudes .    for comparison with the experiment",
    "we need also to compute the phase shifts for the different channels .",
    "these are obtained from the corresponding partial waves amplitudes .",
    "the proper generalization of the standard @xmath83 isospin projections to the @xmath84 case is given by [ 9 ] : @xmath85 and the partial waves are given by : @xmath86 then , the @xmath87 amplitude is of the order of one but , for instance , the @xmath88 and the @xmath89 amplitudes are of the order of @xmath5 . thus at the leading order of the large @xmath0 expansion @xmath90 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 ( remind that @xmath65 is of the order of @xmath5 ) .",
    "now it is easy to show that in this approximation the partial waves have the proper cut structure and also are elastic unitary i.e. @xmath93 just above the unitarity cut as they must be .    in fig.2",
    "we show the result of our fit of the @xmath94 phase shift channel for elastic pion scattering .",
    "this fit has been done with only one parameter , or in other words , by using the very particular model where all the renormalized coupling constants are zero at some scale @xmath44 . as discussed above ,",
    "the only parameter in this specially simple case is the scale @xmath44 .",
    "the fit in fig.2 corresponds to a value of @xmath95 . for other channels like @xmath96 or @xmath97 the prediction of the leading order of the large @xmath0 expansion",
    "is that there is no interaction .",
    "this could appear as a rather poor prediction but it is not the case . by looking at the experimental data one can realize that the phase shifts in these channels grow very slowly with energy , for instance , at @xmath98 of center of mass energy we have @xmath99 degrees and @xmath100 degrees whilst @xmath101 degrees at the same energy .",
    "the conclusion is that for energies below , let say , @xmath98 our simple one parameter fit gives rise to errors in the phase shifts which are lesser than @xmath102 per cent ( refered to the @xmath2 channel ) for the three channels considered . of course , for larger energies things become completely different particularly in the @xmath96 channel where the onset of the @xmath103 resonance makes this channel to be strongly interacting .",
    "one is then tempted to make an interpretation of the scale @xmath44 as some kind of cutoff signaling the range of applicability of our approach and , in fact , this interpretation was discussed in [ 7 ] . from this point of view , it is quite interesting to realize how close is the @xmath44 fitted value @xmath104 to the @xmath103 mass . in some way , by fitting the @xmath2 channel , the model is telling us where new things can appear in other channels like the @xmath96 ( the @xmath103 resonance ) and thus setting the limits of applicability of the model .",
    "however , we would like to stress that our renormalization method is completely consistent and our results are formally valid at any energy independently of the goodness of the fits we can obtain with them .",
    "as it was mentioned above , the second phenomenological application of the large @xmath0 expansion that will be considered here is the description of the nucleon in the context of the so - called skyrmion model . as it is well known , the skyrmion [ 21 ] is a topological soliton of the @xmath105 chiral model",
    ". finite energy and static pion field configurations are continous maps from the compactified space @xmath106 to the coset space @xmath106 .",
    "these applications can be classified in homotopically non - equivalent classes since @xmath107 . therefore every map can be labeled by an integer number . in the skyrmion model of the nucleon",
    "this topological number is interpreted as the baryonic number of the field .",
    "the skyrmion model has proved to give a qualitative description of many of the nucleon properties [ 22 ] including ( in an highly non - trivial way ) the spin [ 23 ] .",
    "the standard ansatz for the skyrmion field is @xmath108 with @xmath109 and @xmath110 being the right boundary conditions for the chiral angle @xmath111 in order to have baryonic number equal to one . in this description of the skyrmion",
    "the chiral field is taken to be an element of @xmath83 which is equivalent to our coset space @xmath106 . in terms of the coordinates used here ,",
    "the skyrmion ansatz is given by @xmath112 . in order to obtain the mass of the skyrmion in the approximation considered in this work we have to introduce this anzatz in the mass functional in eq.22 with the renormalized coupling constants obtained from the fit of the elastic pion scattering described in the previous section .",
    "then , it is not very difficult to find : @xmath113&=&nf^22\\pi\\int_0^{\\infty}dr r^2 ( 2 \\frac{\\sin^2f(r ) } { r^2}+\\cos^2 f(r ) f'(r)^2 ) \\\\ \\nonumber & + & nf^2\\int_0^{\\infty}dr r \\sin ^2f(r)\\int_0^{\\infty}dr ' r ' \\sin ^2f(r ' ) \\int_0^{\\infty}dk\\sin(kr)\\sin(kr ' )    \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\frac{k^2g^r(-k^2;\\mu)}{1+\\frac{k^2}{2(4\\pi)^2f^2 } g^r(-k^2;\\mu)\\log\\frac{\\mu^2}{k^2}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] now the mass functional depends only on the chiral angle @xmath111 . by minimizing this functional",
    "we can find in principle the mass and the shape of the skyrmion in this large @xmath0 approximation . in order to make this task easier we can use some reasonable parametrization of the chiral angle such as the one by atiyah and manton [ 24 ] : @xmath114 where the parameter @xmath115 is a measure of the size of the skyrmion . in fig.3",
    "we show the results obtained when this parametrization is inserted in eq.26 with the @xmath116 obtained in the previous section i. e. we follow the philosophy of [ 25 ] where the authors use the skyrmion model to predict the mass of the proton from the pion scattering data .",
    "the first and obvious conclusion from fig.3 is that , at least for this parametrization , the mass functional has not any minimum but the trivial one at @xmath117 so that the skyrmion tends to shrink to zero size in this approximation .",
    "in fact we have checked that this is also the case when other parametrizations of the chiral angle are used .    therefore , everything seems to indicate that in the large @xmath0 limit considered here , the skyrmion is not stable i.e. we are in a similar situation to the one found when one works with the two derivatives term in eq.1 .",
    "this is a bit disappointing since one of the most appealing properties of the large @xmath0 approximation is that it includes the effect of higher derivative terms and the corresponding higher loops contributions .",
    "this fact improves the unitarity behavior of the amplitudes and one could think that it could also improve the skyrmion description .",
    "however , this is not the case , at least in the leading order considered here .",
    "a simple way to understand why this is not so is the following . in the standard approach to the skyrmion one typically adds to the two derivatives term in the lagrangian one four derivative term called the skyrme term .",
    "this term produce an stable skyrmion in such a way that the contribution to the total energy of the skyrmion coming from the two terms is exactly the same .",
    "it is also possible to add another four derivative term called the non - skyrme term but its contribution can turn the skyrmion unstable .",
    "one - loop effects can also be included in the mass functional [ 26 ] .",
    "one possible interpretation of the origin of the skyrmion and the non - skyrmion terms is to understand them as the low energy remnant of the tail of one vector @xmath118 and one scalar @xmath119 resonance respectively .",
    "in fact it is not difficult to relate the skyrme and the non - skyrme parameters with the masses of the corresponding resonances ( see for instance [ 4 ] ) .",
    "then , the consequence of this picture is that the existence of one vector resonance like the @xmath103 produces an stable skyrmion ( and in fact it is possible to relate the @xmath103 and the nucleon masses ) but one scalar resonance do not produce an stable skyrmion by itself and even it can make unstable the skyrmion when the vector resonance is also present .",
    "if this simple picture were correct ( as it seems to be ) the @xmath103 resonance would be the responsible of the stability of the nucleon in the skyrmion model ( or at least of the pion cloud )",
    ". then it would be possible to understand why the skyrmion is not stable in the large @xmath0 limit approximation considered in this paper .",
    "as we saw in the previous section this approach can describe well the elastic pion scattering in the @xmath2 channel but it does not reproduce the @xmath103 resonance ( yet in some way it predicts its existence ) and therefore it does not contain the piece that seems to keep the skyrmion stable in other much more simple approach that do not include higher derivatives neither higher loops effects .",
    "we have computed the effective action of the @xmath1 non - linear sigma model to leading order on the @xmath5 expansion .",
    "this action is divergent but it can be properly renormalized by introducing an infinite set of counter terms in a systematically way . the energy dependence of the corresponding renomalized couplings can be obtained thus providing a very nice example of how @xmath120 can work beyond the one - loop approximation . with an appropriate choice of these renormalized couplings we can reproduce particular models with the same symmetry breaking pattern as , for example , the linear sigma model .",
    "we can consider also models with a finite number of couplings which can be used to fit the elastic pion scattering experimental data since the partial waves amplitudes have a very good unitarity behavior .",
    "then , with only one parameter it is possible to reproduce well the phase shifts for energies below @xmath98 .",
    "this parameter can be also interpreted as some kind of cutoff setting the limits of the model and , in fact , the fitted value is basically the @xmath103 mass which in principle can not be reproduced since , at leading order in the @xmath5 expansion , the @xmath96 channel is not interacting .",
    "we have also studied the mass functional of the skyrmion solutions and we arrived to the conclusion that the skyrmion solution is not stable at the leading order in the @xmath5 expansion .",
    "this fact is probably related with the above mentioned absence of interaction in the @xmath96 since in other approaches the @xmath103 resonance stabilizes the skyrmion .    in any case",
    ", we consider the @xmath5 expansion of @xmath120 as a very interesting alternative complementary to the standard one - loop computations .",
    "of course , much more work is needed like including pion mass effects , going to the next to leading order in @xmath5 , considering other ways to take the limit like the one based in the @xmath121 non - linear sigma model and finally ( and this was our original motivation ) the applications to the description of the symmetry breaking sector of the standard model as a way to parametrize the future large hadron collider ( lhc ) data .",
