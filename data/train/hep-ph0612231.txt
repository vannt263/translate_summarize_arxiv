    "with the running @xmath3-factory experiments babar at slac and belle at kek , the forthcoming @xmath3-physics programmes of the lhc experiments , especially lhcb , at cern and the future options of @xmath3 experiments at super-@xmath3 factories and at future linear colliders , @xmath3 is one important focus in particle physics today .",
    "it is well known that rare @xmath3 decays , as flavour - changing neutral currents ( fcncs ) , are particularly sensitive to new physics .",
    "the present data from the @xmath3-physics experiments already imply significant restrictions for the parameter space of new physics models and lead to important clues for the direct search for new particles and the model building beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "after new physics will have been discovered , especially when the mass scale of the new physics will have been fixed , such observables , and also correlations between collider and flavour observables , will play an important role in analyzing the underlying new dynamics .    in particular",
    ", there is a flavour problem to solve in any viable new physics model , namely why fcncs are suppressed . in supersymmetry",
    "the flavour problem is directly linked to the crucial question of how supersymmetry is broken .",
    "moreover , there is a corresponding cp problem : while the ckm prescripton has passed its first precision tests , the problem arise of finding the mechanism by which the often numerous additional cp phases are suppressed in a new physics model .",
    "for example , there are very stringent bounds on the 44 phases of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm )",
    ".    one of the main difficulties in examining the observables in @xmath3 physics is the influence of the strong interaction .",
    "if new physics does not show up in flavour physics through large deviations , as recent experimental data indicate , one has to focus on theoretically clean variables such as inclusive rare @xmath3 decays , which are dominated by perturbative contributions or specific ratios of exclusive modes such as cp or charge asymmetries .",
    "it is important to calculate those specifically suitable observables to very high precision in order to exploit their sensitivity to possible degrees of freedom beyond the sm .    in the indirect search for new physics ,",
    "it is also mandatory to go beyond the analysis of branching ratios and to measure more complex kinematical distributions such as cp , forward - backward , and isospin asymmetries to detect subtle patterns and to distinguish between the various scenarios beyond the sm .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss the minimal flavour violation hypothesis and its phenomenological implications .",
    "moreover , two analyses of the large @xmath0 scenario in supersymmetric models are briefly reviewed . in section 3",
    "we briefly discuss some specific opportunities for the new - physics search within @xmath1 transitions and give more details on the present status of the so - called @xmath2 the reader will find a detailed discussion of the @xmath1 transitions in a forthcoming review  @xcite .",
    "there are two general approaches to new physics , which are most suitable in the present situation where no direct evidence for new degrees of freedom beyond the sm exists .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     while a model - independent analysis takes into account the possibility of new flavour structures , which are parametrized by model - independent parameters , an analysis within the minimal flavour violation ( mfv ) hypothesis assumes that the flavour and the cp symmetry are broken as in the sm ; it essentially requires that all flavour- and cp - violating interactions be linked to the known structure of yukawa couplings ( called @xmath4 and @xmath5 in the following ) .",
    "a renormalization - group - invariant definition of mfv based on a symmetry principle is given in  @xcite ; this is mandatory for a consistent effective field theoretical analysis of new physics effects . in fact , a low - energy effective theory with all sm fields including one or two higgs doublets is constructed ; as the only source of @xmath6 flavour symmetry breaking , the ordinary yukawa couplings are introduced as background values of fields transforming under the flavour group ( ` spurions ' )  @xcite .    in the construction of the effective field theory",
    ", operators with arbitrary powers of the dimensionaless @xmath7 have to be considered in principle .",
    "however , the specific structure of the sm , with its hierarchy of ckm matrix elements and quark masses , drastically reduces the number of numerically relevant operators .",
    "for example , it can be shown that in mfv models with one higgs doublet , all fcnc processes with external @xmath8-type quarks are governed by the following combination of spurions due to the dominance of the top yukawa coupling @xmath9 : @xmath10 where a basis is used in which the @xmath8-type quark yukawa is diagonal .",
    "there are two strict predictions in this general class of models , which have to be tested .",
    "first , the mfv hypothesis implies the usual ckm relations between @xmath1 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 transitions .",
    "for example , this relation allows for upper bounds on new - physics effects in @xmath13 , and @xmath14 using experimental data or bounds from @xmath15 , and @xmath16 respectively .",
    "this emphasizes the need for high - precision measurements of @xmath17 , but also of @xmath18 transitions such as the rare kaon decay @xmath19 .",
    "the second prediction is that the ckm phase is the only source of cp violation .",
    "this implies that any phase measurement as in @xmath20 or @xmath21 is not sensitive to new physics .",
    "note that there is also a rg - invariant extension of the mfv concept allowing for flavour - blind phases @xcite ; these lead to non - trivial cp effects , which get , however , strongly constrained by flavour - diagonal observables such as electric dipole moments ( see for an example @xcite ) .",
    "the usefulness of mfv - bounds / relations is obvious ; any measurement beyond those bounds the existence of new flavour structures .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , upper bounds for rare decays in _ constrained _ mfv ( cmfv ) models at @xmath22 probability are presented , see table [ brmfv ] .",
    "furthermore , an upper bound on the @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) mixing in cmfv was established more recently  @xcite . however , there is a subtlety involved .",
    "those bounds are based on a constrained version of mfv where the _ additional _ dynamical assumptions are used that the relevant operators in the electroweak effective hamiltonian for weak decays are the same as in the sm and that new physics only leads to changes of the effective couplings , the wilson coefficients , but not of the ckm factors of those operators .",
    "clearly , those assumptions allow for additional relations between different @xmath3 and kaon observables ( see also @xcite ) , but their violation do not necessarily indicate the existence of new flavour structures .",
    "moreover , they explicitly rule out  as most important difference to the general mfv concept  new scalar operators and , thus , large @xmath0 effects , which are not necessarily based on new flavour structures .",
    "it is well known that scenarios including two higgs doublets with large @xmath25 allow for the unification of top and bottom yukawa couplings , as predicted in grand - unified models ( see @xcite ) , and for sizable new effects in helicity - suppressed decay modes ( see @xcite ) .",
    "there are more general mfv relations existing in this scenario due to the dominant role of scalar operators .",
    "however , since @xmath0 is large , there is a new combination of spurions numerically relevant in the construction of higher - order mfv effective namely    @xmath26    which invalidates the general mfv relation between @xmath27 and @xmath12 transitions .",
    "such a large-@xmath28 scenario within the mssm was recently studied in ref .",
    "the addditional supersymmetric structure leads to more correlations between the observables .",
    "it is shown that for large squark masses and trilinear couplings above @xmath29 tev this scenario explains the present data set naturally , including flavour - conserving observables : for example , the significant enhancement of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon @xmath30 and the large scalar higgs mass above @xmath31 gev , but also the quite modest non - standard contributions to @xmath32 mixing and to @xmath33 .",
    "however , it allows for a large enhancement of @xmath34 and for a significant suppression of @xmath35 , features compatible with present data .",
    "obviously , the future measurements of the latter two observables are crucial for the test of this attractive new - physics scenario .    ) as a function of @xmath0 in a mfv gut scenario with @xmath36.[enrico],width=287 ]     but @xmath37.[enricoii],width=287 ]    in fig .",
    "[ gino ]  @xcite the constraints of the various @xmath3 physics observables and of @xmath30 on the two parameters @xmath0 and the charged higgs mass @xmath38 are shown in an exemplary mode for the higgs mass parameter @xmath39 , the trilinear term @xmath40 , the average squark mass @xmath41tev , @xmath42tev , and @xmath43tev .",
    "for the exclusion regions for @xmath44 and @xmath45 the bounds at @xmath46 c.l . were taken into account and in the case of @xmath47 the nll prediction was still used .",
    "possible bounds from a future measurement of @xmath48 and @xmath49 are also indicated .",
    "large-@xmath0 effects in @xmath50 have been analysed , assuming a supersymmetric minimal flavour violation structure at the gut scale  @xcite .",
    "the correlations with other decay modes are shown in figs .",
    "[ enrico ] and [ enricoii ] , with a mass of the pseudoscalar higgs of @xmath51 , for a higgs mass parameter @xmath52 negative and positive , respectively .",
    "the grey points do not survive the constraints from @xmath53 and @xmath30 .",
    "large enhancement effects are still possible for @xmath36 .    flavour structures beyond the yukawa couplings can be introduced into the effective field theory approach with the help of addditional spurions of the flavour group .",
    "practically , this allows for a different hierarchy between the various spurion terms compared with the one fixed by the structure of the sm .",
    "quite recently such a general framework was discussed as next - to - minimal flavour violation scenario ( nmfv )  @xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , a special choice of additional spurions are introduced , which modifies only the couplings of the 3rd quark generation .",
    "this represents a phenomenologically well - defined class of models ; at present those escape from the most stringent experimental bounds , which are mainly on the first two generations . how minimal flavour violation can be extended into the framework of gut theories is analysed in ref .",
    "data from @xmath54 and @xmath55 physics shows that new sources of flavour violation in and are strongly constrained , while the possibility of sizable new contributions to still remains open  @xcite .",
    "we also have hints from model building ; flavour models are not very effective in constraining the sector  @xcite . moreover , in supersymmetric grand - unified theories the large mixing angle in the neutrino sector relates to large mixing in the right - handed @xmath56@xmath57 sector @xcite .",
    "squark decays are governed by the same mixing matrices as the contributions to flavour violating low - energy observables .",
    "this allows for possible direct correlations between flavour non - diagonal observables in @xmath3 and collider physics .",
    "the present bounds on squark mixing , induced by the low - energy data on @xmath58 transitions , still allow for large contributions to flavour violating squark decays at tree level  @xcite .    among the flavour - changing current processes ,",
    "the inclusive @xmath59 and @xmath60 modes are still the most prominent .",
    "the stringent bounds obtained from those modes on various non - standard scenarios are a clear example of the importance of clean fcnc observables in discriminating new - physics models .",
    "the ratio of @xmath33 has already been measured by several independent experiments  @xcite , leading to the world average of those five measurements ( performed by the heavy flavour averaging group  @xcite ) for a photon energy cut @xmath61 : @xmath62 where the first error is a combined statistical and systematical one , the second and third are additional systematical errors due to the extrapolation and to the @xmath63 fraction , respectively .",
    "after a global effort , the first theoretical prediction of the branching ratio to @xmath64 has been recently presented  @xcite . for @xmath65",
    "the new prediction reads : @xmath66 the overall uncertainty consists of non - perturbative ( 5% ) , parametric ( 3% ) , higher - order ( 3% ) and @xmath67-interpolation ambiguity ( 3% ) , which have been added in quadrature .",
    "compared with the hfag average given in eq .",
    "( [ hfag ] ) , the nnll prediction is @xmath68 below the experimental data .",
    "the decay @xmath69 is particularly attractive because of kinematic observables such as the invariant dilepton mass spectrum and the forward ",
    "backward ( fb ) asymmetry .",
    "the recently calculated nnll contributions  @xcite have significantly improved the sensitivity of the inclusive @xmath70 decay in testing extensions of the sm in the sector of flavour dynamics ; in particular , the value of the dilepton invariant mass @xmath71 , for which the differential forward  backward vanishes , is one of the most precise predictions in flavour physics with a theoretical uncertainty well below @xmath72 .",
    "a recent update of the dilepton mass spectrum , integrated over the low dilepton invariant mass region in the muonic case , leads to  @xcite @xmath73 where the error includes the parametric and perturbative uncertainties only .",
    "the analogous update of the other nnll predictions will be presented in a forthcoming paper  @xcite .",
    "the corresponding rare exclusive decays , such as @xmath74 , @xmath75 or also @xmath76 , are experimentally distinguished observables at the forthcoming lhcb experiment .",
    "in contrast to the measurement of the branching ratios , measurements of cp , forward - backward , and isospin asymmetries are less sensitive to hadronic uncertainties . particularly , the value of the dilepton invariant mass @xmath77 , for which the differential forward  backward asymmetry vanishes , can be predicted in quite a clean way . in the qcd factorization approach , at leading order in @xmath78 , the value of @xmath77 is free from hadronic uncertainties at order @xmath79 , a dependence on the soft form factor @xmath80 and the light - cone wave functions of the @xmath3 and @xmath81 mesons appear at order @xmath82 .",
    "the latter contribution , calculated within the qcd factorization approach , leads to a large shift ( see  @xcite ) . nevertheless , there is the well - known issue of power corrections ( @xmath83 ) within the qcd factorization approach .",
    "there are also certain transversity amplitudes in @xmath84 , which are rather insensitive to hadronic uncertainties and in particular highly sensitive to non - standard chiral structures of the @xmath1 current  @xcite .",
    "for more details on those observables and also on distinguished mixing - induced or direct cp asymmetries in @xmath85 transitions , the reader is referred to a forthcoming review  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath87 modes are well known for being sensitive to new electroweak penguins beyond the sm  @xcite . the data on cp - averaged @xmath86 branching ratios can be expressed in terms of three ratios : @xmath88+{\\cal b}[\\bar b^0\\to\\pi^+k^- ] }          { { \\cal b}[b_d^+\\to\\pi^+k^0]+{\\cal b}[b_d^-\\to\\pi^-\\bar k^0]}\\nonumber\\\\   { r_n}=\\frac12 \\frac{{\\cal b}[b^0\\to\\pi^-k^+]+{\\cal b}[\\bar b^0\\to\\pi^+k^- ] }          { { \\cal b}[b^0\\to\\pi^0k^0]+{\\cal b}[\\bar b^0\\to\\pi^0 \\bar k^0]}\\nonumber\\\\   { r_c}=2\\frac{{\\cal b}[b_d^+\\to\\pi^0 k^+]+{\\cal b}[b_d^-\\to\\pi^0 k^- ] }          { { \\cal b}[b_d^+\\to\\pi^+ k^0]+{\\cal b}[b_d^-\\to\\pi^- \\bar k^0]}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the actual data presented at ichep06 read  @xcite    @xmath89    which is a significant change with respect to the pre - ichep06 data : @xmath90 or , with respect to the pre - ichep04 data : @xmath91 the previous data sets were often called anomalous in view of the sum rule proposed in refs .",
    "@xcite , which leads to the prediction @xmath92 and the available sm approaches to these data based on qcd factorization techniques and on @xmath93 symmetry assumptions .",
    "the corresponding bbns predictions , based on the qcd factorization approach  @xcite , are @xmath94 moreover , approximate flavour symmetries ( isospin or @xmath93 ) can also be used to relate different decay amplitudes and reduce the number of unknown hadronic parameters  @xcite . in a study",
    "@xcite along these lines , the @xmath95 data were used to make theoretical predictions on the @xmath87 modes .",
    "this specific approach leads to  @xcite @xmath96    the uncertainties reflect the experimental uncertainties of the @xmath95 data only . in the future the assumptions of the @xmath93 symmetry",
    "can be tested experimentally .",
    "because of the large non - factorizable contributions identified in the @xmath95 channel , however , large non - factorizable @xmath93- or isospin - violating qcd and qed effects within the sm can not be ruled out yet  @xcite .     and",
    "@xmath97 ( @xmath98 band ) with indirect fit ( @xmath99 contour ) .",
    "[ charles1],width=241,height=257 ]    nevertheless , the new data set  @xcite significantly moved into the ballpark of the sm estimates .",
    "in the previous analyses the radiative corrections to charged particles in the final state were not taken into account , as was emphasized in the past ( see for example ref .",
