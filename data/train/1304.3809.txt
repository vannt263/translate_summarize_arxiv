    "diat and roux first discovered 20 years ago closely - packed multi - lamellar vesicle ( mlv ) structures , so - called the onion phase , in nonionic surfactant - water mixtures under shear flow .",
    "@xcite in the last two decades , this onion structure has been studied experimentally using light , @xcite neutron , @xcite and x - ray scattering , @xcite and also by freeze - fracture electron microscopy , @xcite and the rheo - nmr method .",
    "@xcite its rheology has been of large interest .",
    "@xcite typically , a critical shear rate @xmath2 separates the lamellae and onion phases , where the latter phase consists of mono - disperse onions containing hundreds of lamellar layers .",
    "the onion radius @xmath3 is reversible and can be described by a unique decreasing function of the shear rate @xmath4 .",
    "@xcite    time - resolving small - angle neutron scattering experiments have revealed that a two - dimensional intermediate structure is formed during the lamellar - to - onion transition with increasing shear rate .",
    "@xcite a cylindrical or wavy lamellar structure was speculated to be the transient intermediate structure , but could not be distinguished from the scattering pattern alone .",
    "recent small - angle x - ray scattering experiments with increasing temperature at constant shear rate also indicate a similar pattern around the lamellar - to - onion transition .",
    "@xcite thus , there are some experimental evidences of a transient state , but its structure is still under debate . an alternative experimental approach to gain insight into the structural changes is to characterize defects observed in the lamellar state for moderate shear rates , both in surfactant membranes @xcite and in thermotropic liquid crystals .",
    "@xcite it is also worth mentioning that stable cylindrical structures on a ten - micrometer length scale are observed when strong shear flow is applied in the lamellar - sponge coexistence state .",
    "@xcite    several theoretical attempts have been made to tackle this complex problem of structural evolution under shear flow , which consider either instability of the lamellar phase due to undulations @xcite or the break - up of droplets .",
    "@xcite recently , a `` dynamical '' free energy of mlv under shear flow has been proposed , @xcite which takes into account the slow modes induced by the solvent between the membranes together with their bending and stretching forces . the scaling relations for the mlv size and the terminal shear rate are predicted in agreement with the experiments of refs .  .",
    "in these theories , while the hydrodynamic effects of the solvent are taken into account , the analysis is performed for geometrically simple structures , asp spherical onions or planar lamellae .",

    "this model is well suitable to study membrane dynamics accompanied by topological changes .",
    "alternatively , membranes can be modeled as triangulated surfaces , @xcite which require however discrete bond reconnections to describe topological changes .",
    "@xcite after the first meshless - membrane model was proposed in 1991 , @xcite several meshless - membrane models have been developed .",

    "previously , @xcite we have combined our meshless - membrane model with multi - particle collision ( mpc ) dynamics , @xcite a particle - based hydrodynamic simulation technique .",
    "with mpc , the hydrodynamic interactions are properly taken into account , but due to the frictional coupling of membrane and solvent , solvent particles can penetrate through the membrane .",
    "we here extend the meshless - membrane model into explicit solvent simulation model , in which the fluid particles interact with each other and with the membrane via short - ranged repulsive potentials , so that the solvent can hardly penetrate the membrane , and simulate it with dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd ) , another hydrodynamics simulation technique .",

    ", such a large simulation with as many as one - million particles can be realized by parallelized molecular dynamics simulation methods .",
    "our main results concern the effects of shear flow on the structure formation of membrane ensembles . various structures including vesicles , lamellae , and multi - lamellar states with nearly cylindrical symmetry have been found , most of which are qualitatively consistent with experimental observations of non - ionic surfactant membranes under shear flow .",
    "especially , a cylindrical instability of multi - lamellar membrane is predicted to occur perpendicularly to the flow direction .",
    "the corresponding scattering patterns are in qualitatively agreement with the results of small angle neutron ( and x - ray ) scattering experiments under shear deformation .",
    "the rolled - up lamellae are a good candidate for the intermediate structures on the way to the onion state , which are observed in the experiments .",
    "our simulations do not reproduce onion formation , which is ubiquitously observed in experiments on @xmath214 m length scales .",
    "we speculate that it is due to the limited system size , which can be overcome by larger - scale calculations in the future . on the other hand , in the experiments , strains larger than @xmath215 are necessary to reach the onion state , which indicates that very long simulation runs are required to obtain these states .    the control of the physical parameters including the line tension @xmath6",
    ", the bending rigidity @xmath5 , and the gaussian modulus @xmath216 is another challenge . while @xmath6 and @xmath5 are easily controlled in our model , @xmath216 is more difficult",
    ". the gaussian modulus @xmath216 might also play an important role in the structure formation , because it is directly related to topological changes happening on the way of onion formation .",
    "in the present simulation model , solvent particles have a similar size as membrane particles . here",
    ", we discuss the finite - size effects of the solvent particles , if much higher solvent densities are used than in the present study .",
    "when the solvent particles are densely packed , the system approaches a crystallization transition , and local crystalline order emerges to bring about interactions between closely spaced lamellar layers .    as an example , we study the explicit - solvent meshless - membrane model for higher number density ( denoted system @xmath217 ) , where @xmath218 with the total particle number @xmath219 ) .",

    "after an initial relaxation from a random configuration of the membrane particles , the membrane layers assemble into stacks , and then form mlvs after gathering a certain amount of the membrane patches . in the snapshot ,",
    "the layers are stacked with distances @xmath233 , which seems to arise from the discreteness of the interstitial solvent particles  here it should be noted that interlayer distance can not be smaller than @xmath234 because it is inside the range of @xmath235 and @xmath17 , which both act repulsively .     equilibrium lamellar distance @xmath236 versus initial lamellar distance @xmath237 between a tension - less planar membrane and two ( smaller ) membrane discs . for the systems @xmath238 and @xmath226 , lengths are represented in units of @xmath24 and @xmath221 , respectively .",

    ", we simulate three lamellar layers in the following way .",
