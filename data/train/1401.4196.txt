    "one of the crucial ingredients to the scenario of extra dimensions is a brane on which particles of standard model are localized . in string theory ,",
    "fields can naturally be localized on d - branes due their open string endings @xcite .",
    "although , extra dimensions are generally proposed in compactified form , the localization mechanism for gravity can lead to new possibilities @xcite . due to gravitational interactions between brane in uncompactified 5d - space , a four dimensional newtonian behavior can be achieved when the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension are related .",
    "additionally , gravitons can be localized on branes by separating two patches of ads5 space - time @xcite .",
    "static 4d - brane universes can exist under the requirement that their tension is fine - tuned with the bulk cosmological constant .",
    "interesting models in which extra dimensions can also take advantage in the ads / cft correspondence , where strongly coupled 4d theory to 5d warped dimensions can be related @xcite .",
    "extensions to charged branes and thermal strings are also possible scenarios @xcite .",
    "a more recent fact is the string - theoretic interpretation of the black holes in terms of dp - branes wrapping around six compactified dimensions associated to qubits from quantum information ( qi ) @xcite .",
    "this is the so - called black hole qubit correspondence ( bhqc ) @xcite .",
    "it has lead to important achievements as the association between black hole entropy emerging from the solution of n = 2 supergravity stu model of string compactification and tripartite entanglement measurement @xcite , the association between the black hole configurations in stu supergravity and entanglement state classification borsten , borsten13 and the identification of the hilbert space of the qubits associated to the wrapped branes inside the cohomology of the extra dimensions @xcite .",
    "in fact , many important results were obtained levay4,borsten4,levay3,levay5,levay6,borsten5,borsten2,levay7 ( see @xcite for a more complete review ) .",
    "it is believed that this bhqc can also be extended to the context of supergeometries diego4,diego5,diego6,diego7 .    in this paper",
    ", we propose a bhqc from the point of view of quantum circuits and give the corresponding interpretation .",
    "although recently the role of entanglement and superpositions were explored in bhqc , quantum circuits was not explored clearly in this context , mainly the interpretation in the string side of the bhqc .",
    "as we will discuss , this step is fundamental to explore the bhqc in terms of quantum circuits .",
    "we explore the correspondence and its association to quantum information , giving a clear interpretation for complete correspondence with bhqc , moving steps forward to the role of quantum circuits in the bhqc , in particular to explore string theoretical scenarios . in agreement with previous proposals ,",
    "we first associate the wrapped brane qubits in the bhqc according to an one - to - one association @xcite and then build the necessary gate operations to implement quantum circuits @xcite . as instances ,",
    "we obtain specific quantum circuits as the generation of bell states , quantum teleportation circuit @xcite and generation of ghz states . the fundamental point we propose the interpretation of these quantum circuits with base on the bhqc for the classification of entanglement classes @xcite .",
    "although this clear structure is dressed in a quantum information formalism , the presence of the interpretation gives the key point for establishing the bhqc in this context .",
    "this step was not clarified in the previous proposals .",
    "we organized the paper as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we consider gate operations with base on the bhqc of wrapped brane qubits and perform quantum circuits in bhqc . in sec .",
    "iii , we address the bhqc of quantum circuits in the interpreting these systems from the stu black hole side .",
    "section iv  is devoted to make some brief remark concerning the superstring viewpoint of the results .",
    "finally , our conclusions are reserved to sec.v .",
    "the relations in the bhqc for qubits from extra dimensions start with the associations between one - forms and one - mode states @xmath0 , where the vacuum state is can be associated to an holomorphic three - form in the calabi - yau space and @xmath1 is the khler potential @xcite .",
    "the orthonormality relations are written as @xmath2 the action of the hodge star operator @xmath3 , that introduces a phase term on @xmath4 . in a superposed state ,",
    "@xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the action of the flat khler covariant derivative @xmath6 follow the rules @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and the flat adjoint covariant derivatives follows the corresponcences @xmath9 and @xmath10 , leading to bhqc with bit - flippers @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 a general qubit state in extra dimensions can then be represented by a non - normalized qubit @xmath14 .",
    "the basic elements @xmath3 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 can be used to implement the bhqc to a large range of combinations .",
    "the hodge star operators and the covariant derivatives can be combined to define operators @xmath19 these operators act on one - mode states @xmath18 and @xmath17 leading to the following relations @xmath20 .",
    "the action of these operators on qubit states are @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "these operators are then equivalent to a not gate @xcite and are related to each other by means of @xmath23 .",
    "it follows , all the one - mode gate operations can be realized by combinations of the actions of the operator @xmath24 and its square @xmath25 .",
    "we can also have hadamard gates by means of the operations @xmath26 and @xmath27 or @xmath28 and @xmath29 and @xmath30-mode case . in the case of a two - mode space ,",
    "whose basis is @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 it is also easy to check that @xmath34 , zero otherwise . as in the one - mode case , we can define new operators @xmath35 that lead to the following results @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 .    a controlled not ( cnot ) gate can be implemented considering the conjugation rules @xmath53 these rules corresponds to the operation @xmath54 corresponds to the control and @xmath55 to the target . as can be verified , this gate can be written as the action of the following operator @xmath56 . as direct application of the bhqc , we can verify the usual quantum circuits implementing bell states and quantum teleportation .",
    "taking the input state @xmath57 on the input state we have the first bell state @xmath58 can be generated by applying the @xmath59 gate operation @xmath60 leads to @xmath61 , results @xmath62          let us consider now a qubit state with coefficients @xmath63 and @xmath64 unknown .",
    "we can realize a quantum state teleportation by means of a circuit teleportation @xcite with the use of the previous gate operations . the initial state can be represented by @xmath65",
    "correspond to the first mode and @xmath66 to the second mode of the bell state .",
    "the coefficients of @xmath67 are generally unknow .    under a cnot gate",
    "where the qubed mode @xmath68 is the control state , the state ( [ 2wwe ] ) is modified to @xmath69applying the hadamard gate operation in the mode @xmath68 , we arrive at @xmath70 |0\\rangle _ { b_{2 } }   \\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\alpha \\left ( |0\\rangle _ { a}+|1\\rangle _ { a}\\right ) |1\\rangle _ { b_{1}}+\\beta \\left ( |1\\rangle _ { a}-|0\\rangle _ { a}\\right ) |0\\rangle _ { b_{1}}% \\right ] |1\\rangle _ { b_{2 } } ,   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\]]and applying a @xmath71 operation on the mode @xmath68 we arrive in the opposed hadamard operation @xmath72 |0\\rangle _ { b_{2 } }   \\nonumber   \\label{diao } \\\\ & + & \\left [ \\alpha \\left ( |0\\rangle _ { a}+|1\\rangle _ { a}\\right ) |1\\rangle _ { b_{1}}+\\beta \\left ( |0\\rangle _ { a}-|1\\rangle _ { a}\\right ) |0\\rangle _ { b_{1}}% \\right ] |1\\rangle _ { b_{2}}.   \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\end{aligned}\\]]since the usual projection relations applies to the one - forms , we can project the total state into the state @xmath73 , given by the application of the projector @xmath74on the whole state ( [ diao ] ) , the mode @xmath66 then assumes the state @xmath75which corresponds to the quantum state teleportation of the qubed from the mode @xmath68 to @xmath66 ( figure [ t1 ] ) .",
    "the association between the entropy of an stu black hole supergravity and a 3-tangle of a given tripartite state in one - to - one correspondence borsten leads to a clear association with a purelly tripartite entangled state , the ghz state @xcite . considering a three qubit quantum circuit , this state",
    "is generated from a bell state @xmath76 and a third state @xmath77 , applying a cnot gate in @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the control , we generate a ghz state ( figure [ tghz ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the same result is obtained if the control qubit is @xmath80 .",
    "we can just write , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 as described in @xcite can be interconnected by gate operations .",
    "we can implement for instance the an interchange of @xmath86 to @xmath83 by applying a hadamard gate in the third qubit and then a cnot gate operations between the second and the third as control @xmath87 preserved to @xmath88 preserved ( figure [ tsusy ] ) . on the other hand , the quantum circuit for the generation of a ghz state corresponds to a passage from a small ( non - attractor ) to a large ( attractor ) black hole with susy @xmath89 preserved or completelly broken ( figure tsusy2 ) .",
    "an implementation of stu black holes associated to four qubit systems borsten13,levay4 is made in analogous way to the previous circuits , we can derive a quantum circuit for four entanglement to implement a bhqc applying adequate quantum gate operations in the presence of an auxiliary qubit , for example , @xmath90 under a cnot gate .",
    "the extension to quantum circuits with a higher number of qubits can be made straightforwardly by the introduction of new auxiliary qubits .",
    "this procedure corresponds to deal with a given @xmath91-form in the cohomology class of wrapped d@xmath92-branes .",
    "other mechanisms , as the process of moduli stabilization at the horizon associated to entanglement distillation to a ghz state @xcite can also be implemented in a more clear form from the perspective of bhqc in quantum circuits . because the automorphism group corresponds to the u - duality group of a variety 4-dimensional supergravities , in the context of the freudenthal s construction @xcite , the bhqc can be implemented to start from a three - qubit separable projective coset and implement the gate operations to move to a biseparable projective coset or two entangled qubits coset .",
    "for instance , @xmath93 as a consequence , quantum circuits can also be implemented to connect automorphism ( slocc ) groups in bhqc . in a fts rank system",
    ", it corresponds to move from given rank system and other rank system , as , for example , starting from a rank 1 system and generate a rank 4 , rank 3 system or rank 2a , 2b , 2c system .",
    "it is important to remind in these cases that , the conventional concept of matrix rank may be generalised to freudenthal triple systems @xcite in a natural and authomorphic invariant manner .",
    "as is well known calabi - yau manifolds are important in superstring theory because the ten conjectural dimensions are supposed to come as four of which we are aware , carrying some kind of fibration with fiber dimension six , and they leave some of the original supersymmetry ( susy ) unbroken @xcite .",
    "the importance of the states contructed via entanglement in the different quantum - information theoretical processes described here , is that as the starting point , the geometry of a calabi - yau manifold  is used to define such states .",
    "consequently , the topology of the calabi - yau manifold changes ( not the dimension ) making that the preserved susy under the compactification process also change .",
    "that means that we have a mechanism to control the preserved susy under the compactification process .    in resume",
    ": the importance of the construction of the physical states formed by the entanglement of geometrical entities by cohomological operations automatically allows the preservation of different amounts of susy in the compactification process given an alternative to the case when fluxes are introduced in the game : the generalized calabi - yau of hitchin @xcite .",
    "we have considered quantum circuits implemented in the context of bhqc with qubits from wrapped branes . applying first to obtain quantum circuits to generation of bell , ghz states and teleportation",
    ", we then connect the states involved interpreting these quantum circuits in terms of the entanglement classes classification associated to the entropy and susy configurations of stu black holes @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", we used our formulation to consider the interchange of susy , black hole configurations , freudenthal s and rank system contructions by means of bhqc quantum circuits .",
    "as we have clearly seen , the results show that the cohomological operations performed and proposed in this paper allow the amount of supersymmetry preserved , be more flexible under compactification that from the quantum field theoretical point of view is extremely important due that the interplay between the susy  preserved , the moduly space and the geometry / topology of the remanent ( super ) phase space    this proposal is also useful in the mechanism of moduli stabilization at the horizon @xcite , by considering corresponding bhqc quantum circuits , what can be implemented in a future work elsewhere .    in the context of riemannian superspaces of @xcite , it is possible to reformulate consistently this construction at the operator level avoiding the black hole interpretation due that",
    ", as we have been shown , the black / hole entropy argument is not necessary because the spacetime carry itself the quantum / statistical properties ( there is not dependence of such properties on a particular solution , as in the black hole case ) .",
    "this is also important in the construction of the physical states formed by the entanglement of geometrical entities by cohomological operations .",
