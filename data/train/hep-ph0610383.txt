    "origin of gaugino masses is one of the important issues in supersymmetric ( susy ) extension of the standard model ( sm ) . in the minimal supergravity model @xcite",
    ", a hidden sector is introduced , and its interactions with the observable sector are assumed to be suppressed by the gravitational scale .",
    "majorana gaugino mass terms in the minimal susy sm ( mssm ) are derived by a singlet chiral multiplet with non - vanishing @xmath1-component in the hidden sector .",
    "however , introduction of the singlet chiral multiplet makes this model in trouble .",
    "first , other @xmath1-term susy breaking terms in the scalar potential , the @xmath2 and @xmath3 terms , are also generated by the singlet chiral multiplet , and they have @xmath4 phases relative to gaugino masses generically .",
    "they contribute to the electron and neutron electric dipole moments ( edms ) beyond the experimental bounds unless the susy particle masses are heavier than several tev .",
    "this is called as the susy cp problem @xcite .",
    "second is a cosmological problem called as the polonyi problem @xcite .",
    "this problem was considered not to be serious when the polonyi field gets a mass of the dynamical susy breaking scale .",
    "however , it is recently pointed out that the polonyi problem is more serious in hidden sector models in which a singlet chiral multiplet acquires @xmath1-term vacuum expectation value ( vev ) to generate the gaugino masses @xcite .",
    "the linear term of the singlet field is allowed in the k@xmath5hler potential . when the hubble parameter during inflation is not small enough , the linear term destabilizes the minimum of the singlet scalar ( polonyi ) field during the inflation , and the polonyi problem is revived .",
    "therefore , it is one of the ways to construct a realistic susy sm to assume that the hidden sector has no singlet chiral field . even if the hidden sector have no singlet chiral field , majorana gaugino mass terms are generated by the pure supergravity ( anomaly mediation ) effect @xcite .",
    "however , they are suppressed by one - loop factors compared with the gravitino mass . when the particle contents in the susy sm are minimal , the @xmath3 parameter in the higgs potential is of the order of the gravitino mass .",
    "thus , we need to extend this model furthermore .",
    "an alternative way to generate gaugino mass terms is introduction of adjoint chiral superfields into the susy sm @xcite .",
    "when the hidden sector has a u(1 ) gauge multiplet whose @xmath6 component is non - vanishing , dirac mass terms with gauginos and the adjoint fermions are generated @xcite .",
    "their sizes can be comparable to the gravitino mass .",
    "since the gaugino majorana mass terms are also generated by the anomaly mediation effect , the gauginos are pseudodirac fermions .",
    "we call this model as pseudodirac gaugino ( pdg ) model .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the electron and neutron edms in the pdg model .",
    "the dirac gaugino mass term is u(1)@xmath7 invariant , and it is pointed out that the edms are suppressed in a u(1)@xmath7 symmetric limit @xcite , in which the majorana gaugino mass terms , the supersymmetric higgs mass term , and the @xmath2 terms are vanishing .",
    "the u(1)@xmath7 breaking terms are introduced by the supergravity effects in the pdg model .",
    "we found that the edms are still suppressed when the supersymmetric adjoint multiplet mass is small .",
    "thus , the pdg model is a framework to solve the susy cp problem .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in next section",

    "<S> the susy cp problem is one of serious problems in construction of realistic supersymmetric standard models . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the problem in a framework in which adjoint chiral multiplets are introduced and gauginos have dirac mass terms induced by a u(1 ) gauge interaction in the hidden sector . </S>",
    "<S> this is realized in hidden sector models without singlet chiral multiplets , which are favored from a recent study of the polonyi problem . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the dominant contributions to electron and neutron electric dipole moments ( edms ) in the model come from phases in the supersymmetric adjoint mass terms . </S>",
    "<S> when the supersymmetric adjoint masses are suppressed by a factor of @xmath0 compared with the dirac ones , the electron and neutron edms are suppressed below the experimental bound even if the susy particle masses are around 1 tev . </S>",
