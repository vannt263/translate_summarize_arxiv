    "hence , the investigation of physical effects in ds spacetime is important for understanding both the early universe and its future .",

    "the reflecting boundaries alter the zero - point modes of a quantized field and shift the vacuum expectation values of quantities , such as the energy density and stresses . as a result , forces arise acting on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of these forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometry , and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field . since the original work by casimir many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "historically , the investigation of the casimir effect for a spherical shell was motivated by the casimir semiclassical model of an electron . in this model casimir suggested @xcite that poincar stress , to stabilize the charged particle , could arise from vacuum quantum fluctuations and the fine structure constant could be determined by a balance between the casimir force ( assumed attractive ) and the coulomb repulsion .",

    "the boundary induced vevs for both field squared and the energy - momentum tensor depend on time through the proper radius of the sphere and the proper distance from the sphere s center .",
    "this property is a consequence of the maximal symmetry of the bunch - davies vacuum state .",

    "in this region the energy density and the azimuthal stresses have the same sign for the exterior and interior regions , whereas the radial stress and the energy flux have opposite signs .",
    "in particular , for a minimally coupled scalar field the energy flows away from the boundary for dirichlet boundary condition and toward the boundary for non - dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "most interesting is the behavior far from the sphere ; qualitatively different behavior occurs depending on the sign of @xmath341 , where @xmath77 is the number of spatial dimensions , @xmath342 is the conformal parameter , @xmath343 is the mass of the scalar field , and @xmath344 is the curvature scale .",
    "when @xmath43 is positive , the mean field squared and the energy - momentum tensor fall off as a power , while when @xmath43 is imaginary , the large distance behavior is damped oscillatory with the amplitude decaying as @xmath345 for the field squared and the diagonal components of the energy - momentum tensor . for a scalar field with neumann boundary condition the vevs at large distances",

    "note that the behavior of the vevs at distances larger than the curvatures scale of the background spacetime is completely different from the case of a spherical boundary in minkowski spacetime . in the latter case and for a massive field the boundary - induced vevs at distances larger than the compton wavelength of the scalar particle",
