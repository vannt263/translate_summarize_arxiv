    "some analytic work is also helpful in guiding and interpreting results from numerical studies . to this end , we discuss here a theoretical framework which patches together several ingredients : the fact that dark matter halos and voids are clearly not spherical in shape , but at the very least triaxial ; the observation , supported by simulation results , that halos and voids tend to form in or around local maxima / minima of the density field  rather than at random spatial locations ; the indication that an ` embryonic cosmic web ' is already present in the primordial density field ( bond et al .",
    "1991 ) ; the evidence that there is good correspondence between peaks / dips in the initial conditions and halos / voids at later times ; the crucial role of the tidal field in shaping the cosmic web , and the effects of its correlation with the density hessian ; and the fact that the standard excursion set theory , which determines the initial conditions and is based on the statistics of gaussian fields , only considers random spatial positions .",

    "the initial shear field  rather than the density hessian  is a major player in shaping the geometrical structure of the cosmic web , and originates the characteristic observed pattern of filaments , halos , voids , and sheets .",
    "the morphology of halos and voids departs from sphericity , as the statistics of gaussian fields imply that spherically symmetric initial configurations should be a set of measure zero ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* doroshkevich 1970 ) ) ; the observed triaxiality has several important implications in determining the assembly histories , kinematics , clustering and fundamental structural properties of halos and voids .",
    "rossi et al . ( 2011 ) described a simple dynamical model able to link the final shapes of virialized halos to their initial shapes , by combining the physics of the ellipsoidal collapse with the excursion set theory .",
    "an illustration is provided in figure [ fig2 ] : in a useful planar representation of halo axial ratios , the left panel shows the effect of the initial values of ellipticity and prolateness ( @xmath8 )  which parametrize the surrounding shear field  in determining the future evolution of an object of given mass , for three representative values of @xmath9 when @xmath10 ; the right panel compares the distribution of final axial ratios in the model ( solid black lines ) with results from numerical simulations ( dashed blue lines ) when 10,000 halos of mass @xmath11 are considered  in a flat cosmology with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .     and",

    "although idealized , the previous model provides some useful insights into the nonlinear collapse of structures , and in particular it highlights the fact that a collapsing patch will eventually become a filament , pancake , or halo depending on its initial shape and overdensity .",
    "hence , the eigenvalues of the initial shear field are a key ingredient in determining the final destiny of an object , and more generally in shaping the morphology of the cosmic web . in 1970 ,",
    "doroshkevich derived the joint ` unconditional ' probability distribution of an ordered set of tidal field eigenvalues corresponding to a gaussian potential . recently , akin in philosophy to that of van de weygaert & bertschinger ( 1996 ) , rossi ( 2012 ) provided a set of analytic expressions which extended the work of doroshkevich ( 1970 ) and bardeen et al .",

    ", it is possible to extend the standard distributions of shape parameters ( i.e. ellipticity and prolateness ) in the presence of the density peak / dip constraint ( rossi 2013 , and figure [ fig3 ] ) , which generalize some previous literature work and combine the formalism of bardeen et al .",
