    "nearly four decades ago , the quark confinement was shown by wilson at the strong bare coupling region @xcite . for weak coupling ,",
    "perturbation theory clarified for the yang - mills system that bare coupling @xmath7 tends to vanish as the lattice spacing @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the present work is to attempt to extrapolate the large @xmath9 behavior of bare coupling to the asymptotically free behavior at weak coupling . for the purpose , we like to reformulate the strong coupling expansion by changing the primary variable from bare coupling to the lattice spacing itself .",
    "lattice serves us a suitable regularization , since in lattice field theories the lattice spacing @xmath9 explicitly appears in the action and enters into the physical quantities .",
    "for instance , the dimensionless correlation length @xmath10 represents a physical length scale divided by @xmath9 .",
    "it is given at strong coupling as a series @xmath11 in @xmath12 and it determines , in an implicit manner , the @xmath9 dependence of the bare coupling .",
    "mutual roles of @xmath7 and @xmath10 are exchanged by inverting the relation @xmath11 .",
    "thus we address the question whether the small @xmath10 series of @xmath7 allows us to confirm directly the weak coupling behavior predicted by perturbation theory .    in the present paper , in non - linear @xmath0 model at two dimensions , we make an attempt to approximate the asymptotic behavior of bare coupling in the continuum limit via its large @xmath9 expansion .",
    "the model is of interest as a testing ground of our approach , since it enjoyes asymptotic freedom and dynamical mass generation for @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "in addition to the large @xmath13 limit , we also consider the case of finite @xmath13 .    as the basic variable , rather than the correlation length in lattice space ,",
    "we adopt mass @xmath1 in momentum space defined by the zero momentum limit of the two - point field correlation .",
    "the lattice spacing @xmath9 is included in the mass which is rescaled to be dimensionless and then @xmath1 must vanish in the continuum limit @xmath8 ( see ( [ mass ] ) ) .",
    "now the strong coupling expansion gives series of @xmath1 in @xmath14 . by inverting the series",
    ", we express @xmath3 as a power series in @xmath4 , which is equivalent to large @xmath9 expansion .",
    "as it would be , naive series fails to confirm the continuum behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "however , it is nontrivial and interesting to examine , when both pad and borel techniques are applied on the series , whether the continuum scaling emerges at finite @xmath13 or not .    before proceeding to following sections ,",
    "we remark the role of borel transform in our approach .",
    "we use borel transform as a device of dilation operation around the continuum limit .",
    "the response of scale transformation on @xmath15 is probed by rescaling @xmath1 to @xmath16 in @xmath17 and taking the @xmath18 limit .",
    "then , it is said @xmath17 scales with the exponent @xmath19 if @xmath20 the above criterion of scaling is implemented by introducing @xmath21 defined by @xmath22 and performing expansion to some finite orders in @xmath21 @xcite .",
    "suppose the function approaches to @xmath23 .",
    "then , expanding it to @xmath24 and setting @xmath25 , one has @xmath26 .",
    "further , if we take the limit @xmath27 with @xmath28 fixed , we obtain @xmath29 that is , the limit @xmath18 has transitioned to the limit @xmath30 with the cut off @xmath31 .",
    "then the scaling behavior with exponent @xmath19 manifests itself in the power of @xmath32 .",
    "note the universal quantity @xmath19 is left unchanged . on the other hand , when same operation is acted on @xmath17 in the series form @xmath33 valid at large @xmath1 , we have @xmath34 with a larger convergence radius , which is just the borel transform of the original series .",
    "we thus interpret the borel transform as a realization of scale transformation .",
    "we do not need integrating @xmath35 back to @xmath17 .",
    "though the information of @xmath15 over the whole range of @xmath1 is not obtained , what we need in lattice field theories is the behavior of @xmath15 in the neighborhood of @xmath36 .",
    "on the two - dimensional square lattice , the continuous spin fields @xmath37 are set on every sites .",
    "the action of the system is given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 the fields are constrained to satisfy at every sites , @xmath41 .",
    "the mass variable @xmath1 defined via the zero momentum limit of the propagator @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 where susceptibility @xmath44 and second moment @xmath45 are , respectively , given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 denotes the dimension of lattice space and @xmath49 in the present work .",
    "let us summarize the continuum limit of the model and large @xmath9 expansion of @xmath3 .",
    "the perturbative renormalization group predicts that , for @xmath6 , the correlation length behaves at weak coupling as @xmath50\\big(\\frac{2\\pi n\\beta}{n-2}\\big)^{-1/(n-2)}\\big(1+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{a_{k}}{\\beta^k}\\big ) , \\label{rg}\\ ] ] where the multiplied constant @xmath51 is specified only non - perturbatively .",
    "hasenfratz et .",
    "al . has computed it via thermodynamic bethe ansatz @xcite , giving @xmath52    the terms @xmath53 @xmath54 in ( [ rg ] ) are contributions of @xmath55-loop levels and three- @xcite and four - loop @xcite results were computed in the literature .",
    "they are given as @xmath56 though three and higher loop contributions disappear in the continuum limit for the bare coupling , we can not take out the limit because only the series to finite order is at hand .",
    "hence , we include known three- and four - loop contributions in our analysis .",
    "it is known that @xmath57 has functional form of @xmath3 , the same as ( [ rg ] ) but with another multiplicative constant , say @xmath58 .",
    "however , monte carlo data @xcite showed that the difference is less than a percent at @xmath59 . since the two constants agree with each other in the large @xmath13 limit , the difference between @xmath51 and @xmath58 may actually be negligible for all @xmath6 .",
    "thus the estimation of the mass gap via strong coupling expansion becomes the estimation of @xmath51 and this is one of the aims of our work . .",
    "since the mass @xmath1 approaches to @xmath60 in the continuum limit , the physical mass of dimension @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the finite mass scale given by @xmath64\\big(\\frac{2\\pi n\\beta}{n-2}\\big)^{-1/(n-2)}\\big(1+\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{a_{k}}{\\beta^k}\\big).\\ ] ] from ( [ rg ] ) and @xmath65 , we have continuum @xmath3 to four - loop order as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath66 , \\label{twoloop2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath67    on the series expansion at large @xmath1 , we borrow the result in the work of butera and comi @xcite who computed strong coupling series of @xmath44 and @xmath45 to @xmath68 . using the result",
    ", we have expansion of @xmath1 in powers of @xmath3 , @xmath69 by inverting the above relation , we have @xmath70    based upon the series ( [ strong1 ] ) , we discuss the approximation of the continuum limit by the use of pad - borel approximation scheme .",
    "we attempt to recover the asymptotically free behavior ( [ twoloop2 ] ) from ( [ strong1 ] ) and then estimate @xmath51 .",
    "large @xmath13 limit serves us a good bench mark of our approach .",
    "so we consider that case first and then turn to finite @xmath13 in the next section .    in the large @xmath13 limit , only the one - loop contribution to @xmath3 survives to give @xmath71",
    "as briefly presented in the introduction , borel transform is given by a certain limit of delta expansion @xcite .",
    "explicitly , the logarithm is expanded and gives at @xmath25 that @xmath72 to the order @xmath31 . then using the asymptotic expansion @xmath73 ( @xmath74 denotes euler s constant )",
    ", we have @xmath75 in the @xmath76 limit .",
    "let @xmath77 be small enough with @xmath78 kept finite , then the result represents borel transform of @xmath79 . denoting the operation of borel transform by @xmath80",
    "we thus find @xmath81=\\log \\bar x+\\gamma_{e}$ ] .",
    "using abbreviated simbol @xmath82 $ ] , we then obtain @xmath83    the large @xmath1 expansion of @xmath3 reads @xmath84 borel transform of the above series results to divide the @xmath85th order coefficient by the factorial of @xmath85 , @xmath86 then as a crucial step , we use pad method to extrapolate the above series to larger @xmath87 .",
    "the resultant pad - borel approximants enable us to capture the scaling behavior to be seen in the scaling region as we can see below .    as a preliminary study",
    ", we have examined the behaviors of @xmath88 $ ] approximants of @xmath89 over almost possible pairs of @xmath90 at orders @xmath91 . on the contrary to the condensed matter models undergoing second order phase transition , critical behavior of the present model",
    "is known from perturbation theory as logarithmic and slowly varying .",
    "hence it is conceivable that good behaviors come from the cases where the difference between @xmath92 and @xmath85 is small .",
    "the numerical experiment confirmed it is indeed the case .",
    "we have also compared the approximants of three types , pad - borel , borel only and pad only improvements .",
    "the result at @xmath93th order is shown in fig . 1 .",
    "and @xmath94 at 6th order . two broken lines ( one for @xmath3 and the other for @xmath89 ) represent behaviors at continuum .",
    "horizontal axis corresponds to @xmath95 and @xmath96 ( for pad only case).,title=\"fig : \" ] [ comparison ]    as already reported in @xcite , borel only improvement is not sufficient for observing the asymptotic freedom .",
    "pad only case ( @xmath97}$ ] in fig .",
    "1 ) is also insufficient as is clear from fig .",
    "however , pad - borel approximant shows enough improvement for quantitative approximation . though pade only approximation is found to be improved at higher orders , the best performance is achieved by pad - borel approximant at every order we analyzed .",
    "we therefore focus on pad - borel approximant hereafter .",
    "now , let us turn to the evaluation of the mass gap by estimating @xmath51 .",
    "since we know information at weak coupling , the estimation is carried out by fitting @xmath98 to @xmath88 $ ] order approximants of @xmath94 , @xmath99}$ ] , by adjusting the value of @xmath51 . in practice , we consider the difference between @xmath99}$ ] and @xmath98 and plot the difference by changing the value of @xmath51 . at just proper value of @xmath51",
    ", the two functions touch with each other at a point @xmath100 and the difference is tiny over an interval including @xmath100 .",
    "a typical case is shown in fig . 2 and",
    "the result of estimation of @xmath51 is shown in table  [ tab : estimation1 ] .",
    "for the reason previously written , we list only the results around the diagonal pad .",
    "the result in momentum space is simple modification of the propagator to the continuum limit @xmath105^{-1}$ ] .",
    "since in the large @xmath13 limit , @xmath3 is given by the gap equation written only with the propagator with mass square @xmath1 , we can easily obtain the large @xmath1 series both at first- and infinite - order improved actions ( for detailed presentation , see the first reference in @xcite ) .",
    "for example , at the first order it follows @xmath106 at infinite - order improvement , the right - hand side becomes just the integral of @xmath107 and expansion of @xmath3 in @xmath4 is straightforward .",
    "it now suffices for us to repeat the same procedure for the approximation of ( [ scaling2 ] ) and the constant @xmath51 at the first and inifinite orders of improved actions . here",
    "note that the change of action induces the change of the value of non - universal @xmath51 .",
    "@xmath108 and @xmath109 at first and infinite orders , respectively .",
    "table  [ tab : estimation4 ] summarizes the result of our approximation .",
    "the improved action improves the approximation accuracy both at the first and at infinite orders . though the improved lattice action is conventionally used in the monte carlo analysis and perturbation theory , it is also useful in our approach .    in the present work ,",
    "we have analyzed pad - borel approximants of strong coupling expansion in non - linear @xmath110 model and have found good behaviors approximating the continuum limit .",
    "we close the paper by pointing out that , even working with the standard action , further higher order computation would improve the result for all @xmath13 including the limit @xmath111 .",
    "pad - borel approximants may become effective at larger @xmath87 ( smaller @xmath112 ) and the two unwanted effects , lattice artifacts and omitted loop contributions , would be weaker there .",
    "then , continuum scaling at smaller @xmath112 with a clearer sign of asymptotic freedom near @xmath113 would be seen , which allows us accurate evaluation of the mass gap for all @xmath6 .",
