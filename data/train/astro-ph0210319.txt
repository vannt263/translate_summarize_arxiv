    "for three decades it has been known that a small minority of white dwarfs ( wds ) have detectable magnetic fields , but the percentage has remained somewhat uncertain .",
    "angel , borra , & landstreet ( 1981 ) summarized the early surveys with the statement : `` we find that bp(b ) , the probability per octave , is roughly constant at 0.005 for fields in the range 3@xmath210@xmath3  g to 3@xmath210@xmath4  g , and does not exceed this value down to 10@xmath3  g. '' below 3@xmath210@xmath3  g they noted that more precise longitudinal polarization measurements were necessary to detect magnetism .    with the introduction of ccd detectors more than a decade ago ,",
    "surface field strengths well below 10@xmath3  g were accessed for the first time .",
    "schmidt & smith ( 1994 , 1995 ) reported results from extensive surveys using a polarimeter and spectropolarimeter . in the first reference , they concluded `` the overall incidence of magnetism among white dwarfs remains low , with more than 90% of stars having fields below @xmath110 kg[kilogauss ] . '' in the second reference they stated `` the incidence of magnetism among white dwarfs is found to be @xmath51.5% for fields between 3@xmath210@xmath6 and 10@xmath7  g. ''    in their comprehensive review paper describing the properties of the 65 magnetic white dwarfs ( mwds ) then known , wickramasinghe & ferrario ( 2000 , hereafter wf00 ) had this summary statement : `` the isolated mwds comprise @xmath15% of all wds . ''",
    "such modest fractional estimates have led several authors , perhaps beginning with angel et al .",
    "( 1981 ) and later wf00 , to hypothesize that the mwds are the progeny of the peculiar a - b stars , the only main sequence stars known to have formed with `` fossil '' magnetic fields emanating from the stellar cores",
    ".    evidence that the incidence of magnetism could be higher at least for particular kinds of wds has also been noted .",
    "for example , wf00 noted that about 25% of known cataclysmic variables harbor mwds as primaries , but they discuss selection effects in favor of discovery of , for example , the more x - ray luminous am  herculis and dq  herculis accreting mwd systems .",
    "hence , it remains uncertain whether the fraction of mwds is really higher for a true , volume - limited sample of cvs vs. the isolated wds .",
    "vennes ( 1999 ) found that the fraction of mwds is higher ( about 25% ) among stars with masses exceeding 1  @xmath0 in his extreme ultraviolet explorer ( euve ) sample of hot white dwarfs .",
    "this is consistent with studies of individual cooler stars ( e.g. , greenstein & oke 1982 ; liebert 1988 ) that many of the known mwds have quite high masses ( see also the discussion by wf00 ) .",
    "liebert & sion ( 1978 ) noted decades ago that the magnetic field discovery fraction for isolated wds was higher for the cooler than for the hotter wds .",
    "it should also be noted that the cooler stars are generally nearer to the sun than are the hotter wds found in uv - excess or blue color surveys .",
    "fabrika & valyavin ( 1999 ) studied published results and conclude that the frequency of magnetism among hot wds is @xmath8% , but @xmath9% for white dwarfs cooler than 10,000  k. they note that most of the known cool mwds are within a distance of 25  pc .",
    "holberg , oswalt , & sion ( 2002 ) tabulated and studied the sample of known white dwarfs within 20  pc distance .",
    "kawka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) already have noted that the percentage of mwds in this sample exceeds 10% ; this volume - limited sample is of course dominated by cool wds .    theoretical expectation , however , is that fossil magnetic fields in wds should not increase in strength , but rather should decay slowly ( cf .",
    "fontaine , thomas , & van horn 1973 ; see , however , valyavin & fabrika 1999 for a different perspective )",
    ". it must be admitted , in any case , that different discovery techniques and biases are involved in the discovery of hot and cool wds .",
    "wf00 concluded that there is no convincing evidence that the mean magnetic field strength varies with @xmath10 , but they did not comment on the incidence of detected magnetism .",
    "one problem has been that existing data sets are quite heterogeneous , represent different wd discovery techniques , and varying precision in the search for magnetism . in this paper",
    "we revisit these questions , beginning first in section 2 with new statistics for three large and well - studied samples of cool and hot white dwarfs now available . in section 3",
    ", we attempt to sort out the sources of the apparently- conflicting results , to reach a more robust conclusion about the true fraction of mwds , and whether it changes as the white dwarfs cool .",
    "liebert et al . ( 2003 ) have been finishing a detailed study of 324 da white dwarfs from the pg with @xmath10 above about 10,000  k including high signal - to - noise ratio optical ccd spectra covering all balmer lines except h@xmath11 .",
    "the technique of simultaneous line - fitting for the determination of @xmath10 , surface gravity ( @xmath12 ) , combined with the use of evolutionary tracks to determine the mass , radius and the cooling time , is now well - established ( cf .",
    "bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ) . except for the very hottest objects ( perhaps t@xmath13 50,000  k or even higher ) ,",
    "the precise measurement of line profiles makes possible the discovery of any magnetic fields down to a limit of @xmath12 megagauss ( mg ) , below which clean zeeman - splitting of h  i and he  i does not occur .",
    "it is possible that careful measurements of the positions of the high balmer lines could detect quadratic zeeman shifts to significantly lower field strengths ( preston 1970 ) , but our more conservative assessment here is to assume that this has not been done systematically with the spectra .",
    "seven da mwds have been found from this sample , and these are listed in order of decreasing surface field strength in table  1 .",
    "some comments on individual objects are in order . for the parameters of pg  2329 + 267",
    ", we favor the fitted values from bergeron , leggett & ruiz ( 2001 , hereafter blr  see next section ) over the rough mass estimate of 0.9  @xmath14 based on inspection of spectra by moran , marsh , & dhillon ( 1998 ) .",
    "revised parameter estimates from our study are listed for pg  1220 + 234 , and the fit to the spectrum is shown as figure  1 .",
    "a temperature of 14,000  k has been assumed for pg  1015 + 015 , based on the spectrum fit of wickramasinghe & cropper ( 1998 ) .",
    "this star has too strong a field for the line profile - fitting to yield an estimate of the surface gravity .",
    "however , an unpublished trigonometric parallax for this star allows a rough mass estimate of 1.15  @xmath14 .",
    "similar studies cover 24 pg  db white dwarfs by beauchamp ( 1996 ) and include eight pg  do stars by dreizler & werner ( 1996 ) .",
    "one magnetic pg  db star was found from spectropolarimetric observations ( putney 1997 , wesemael et al .",
    "2001 ) ; it is also listed in the table . at an estimated polar field strength of 1  mg ,",
    "however , its field was not detected in the spectrophotomeric study .",
    "finally , the table includes two magnetic stars cooler than 10,000  k  g195@xmath1519 and g128@xmath1572  whose fields were detected in other studies , but also included in the pg survey .",
    "the catalog included 22 other dc white dwarfs , two dz , and eight cool da white dwarfs in the survey for which modern spectra may not be available .",
    "since the stars cooler than 10,000  k are not part of the comprehensive spectrophotometric data set , they are not included in the assessment of the magnetic frequency of the hot pg stars .",

    "( 2001 ) , which also shows that the spectrum is cleanly dc .",
    "we thus exclude this object from further consideration as a mwd .",
    "the brl sample yields a fractional incidence of 14/199 or @xmath21% of mwds with field strengths @xmath162  mg , formally more than three times the fraction found for the pg sample .",
    "this does not include the three stars listed in table  2 with lower or uncertain field strengths .",
    "mass estimates are available for all but two @xmath162  mg mwds ( table 2 ) .",
    "the mean mass is 0.68  @xmath14 .",
    "however , these mass estimates are based on a different method than the direct determinations of the surface gravity .",
    "brl and blr estimated masses by fitting the absolute magnitudes derived from available trigonometric parallaxes .",
    "the evidence is mounting , however , that a fraction of wds exceeding 10% may be unresolved binaries ( napiwotzki et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the apparent magnitude difference of the components may be expected to grow smaller as the stars cool .",
    "if the fitted luminosity is due to two , rather than one star , the inferred mass of the `` single '' star may be underestimated drastically , as noted in both brl and blr .",
    "it is therefore possible that double degenerates in these samples have skewed the mean mass estimate downwards .",
    "moreover , the lack of precision of this method of estimating masses may smear out the expected peak of the mass distribution near 0.6 @xmath14 , the mean found for samples analyzed by the gravity - fitting method ( e.g. , bergeron , saffer , & liebert 1992 ) .",
    "in fact there are three definite or possible binaries for which one component is a _ low _",
    "mass mwd of da type .",
    "g62@xmath1546 was shown to be composite spectrum object consisting of the da `` b '' component whose parameters are listed in table  2 , with a warmer , more massive dc `` a '' component ( bergeron , ruiz , & leggett 1993 ) .",
    "the main reason for invoking a binary hypothesis is that the h@xmath11 zeeman absorption components are too weak for a da of the @xmath10 derived by fitting the energy distribution under the assumption that the flux is from a single star .",
    "these authors discussed the possibility that lhs  2273 , which also exhibits h@xmath11 components too weak for the energy distribution , could be decomposed into a binary with similar properties ( however , the parameters listed in table  2 are taken from the single wd fit in brl ) .",
    "the third such candidate is lhs  1734 , an apparently - single magnetic da of similar @xmath10 to the other two da components , but for which the parallax ( luminosity ) requires the assignment of a very low mass of 0.32  @xmath14 .",
    "such low mass wds should never have reached the required mass for core helium ignition , and should be composed of helium interiors .",
    "it is difficult to understand the evolution to the helium white dwarf stage within the lifetime of the galaxy except to invoke binary mass exchange .",
    "lhs  1734 differs from the other two in that the h@xmath11 line strengths are in agreement with the 5300  k fit to the energy distribution . that is , any companion that we argue must have engaged earlier in close - binary mass exchange must not be contributing significant light at red wavelengths .    that three of these 14 mwds have such low masses may certainly skew the mean mass of the brl sample .",
    "apparently , magnetic white dwarfs may form in binary evolution in a different manner than for single stars , and in particular may have very different mean masses .",
    "it is also curious that all have temperatures around 5 - 6000  k , as was discussed earlier in brl .",
    "such binaries involving a low - mass mwd for whatever reason appear not to be represented in the pg sample ( although low - mass non - magnetic das are certainly present there ) . without the two known binaries , the mean mass of the mwds in the brl sample is 0.76  @xmath14 .",
    "as noted earlier , holberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) tabulated 107 known wds whose best distance estimates indicate that they are within 20 parsecs .",
    "since two of these have been determined to be binary white dwarfs for which we list parameters of the individual components , our sample consists of 109 stars . unlike the two samples considered previously",
    ", this sample lacks a homogeneous spectrophotometric data set , although a majority are in the blr sample .",
    "these authors argue that the sample is complete for the 46 stars out to a distance of 13 parsecs , though the completeness falls to 65% at 20  pc . for reasons discussed in the previous section ,",
    "we exclude lhs  1008 and g227@xmath1528 from the subset of local mwds , which are listed in table  3 .",
    "distance estimates are listed in the last column .",
    "as kawka et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have independently noted , this sample also has a high yield of mwds .",

    "the mean is 0.80  @xmath14 .",
    "since the mass estimates are again derived from trigonometric parallaxes and not spectroscopic measurements of the surface gravity , this value is subject to skewing by any unresolved binaries , as discussed in the previous subsection .",

    "how are these apparently - conflicting results concerning the incidence of wd magnetism to be reconciled ?",
    "we believe that the answer lies first in considering the high mean masses found for mwds in all three samples considered here ( omitting the known binaries in brl ) .",
    "these results are consistent at least qualitatively with the large fraction of massive , euv - selected white dwarfs reported by marsh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) and vennes ( 1999 ) .    since the pg survey is explicitly magnitude - limited ( approximately to @xmath25 )",
    ", it could be subject to a large bias _ against _ the inclusion of mwds . as already noted by liebert & bergeron ( 1994 ) ,",
    "the survey limiting distance is proportional to the stellar radius ( @xmath26 ) , and hence the survey volume for a given mass scales as @xmath27 .",
    "thus the fractional incidence of mwds could be substantially smaller in the pg survey than in a true , volume - limited sample .",
    "other hot white dwarf surveys ( i.e. the hamburg schmidt ) must be vulnerable to the same bias , as is the magnitude - limited polarimetric survey of schmidt & smith ( 1995 ) .",
    "ironically , similar euv / x - ray magnitude limits apply to euve and rosat detections , making the discoveries of many massive , magnetic wds by vennes ( 1999 ) and marsh et al .",
    "( 1997 ) all the more remarkable .",
    "the greater likelihood that massive wds would have close to pure - hydrogen atmospheres  and correspondingly less euv / soft x - ray opacities due to helium and heavier elements  may offset the radius bias .    with the samples of `` local '' white dwarfs ,",
    "the radius bias is more difficult to quantify even if we knew the underlying mass distributions of wds and mwds .",
    "since they are not explicitly magnitude - limited , the bias is likely to be less important .",
    "note that holberg et al .",
    "( 2002 ) claim a complete sample to 13  pc .",
    "the considerably - overlapping blr sample probably is also closer to volume - limited than is the pg .",
    "if one does have a complete sample to a given limiting magnitude , as we argue for the pg , one could correct for the difference in search volume for the mwds if one knew their true distribution in mass .",
    "however , we do not know this distribution . arguably , the pg mwd mass determinations are more accurate , since they are not subject to the binary bias .    to estimate the potential magnitude of the mass - bias on the mwd fractional incidence in the pg survey , let us perform the following exercise :",
    "assume that the true mwd distribution has the estimated mean mass of 0.93  @xmath14 , and that it otherwise has the same `` shape '' as the non - magnetic mass distribution .",
    "the typical pg star at the mass distribution peak of 0.58  @xmath14 ( and @xmath125,000  k ) has a radius of 0.0144  @xmath28 , compared with 0.0091  @xmath28 for a mass of 0.98  @xmath14 . to estimate their representation within a fixed search volume",
    ", each star should be assigned a weight proportional to @xmath29 .",
    "this ratio leads to a properly - weighted relative fraction of mwds of 2.0@xmath300.8 @xmath2 ( 0.0144/0.0091)@xmath31 = 7.9@xmath303% .",
    "this exercise brings the mwd fraction of the pg into better agreement with the cool and nearby wd samples , although it necessarily has substantial errors due to the small , intrinsic number of mwds",
    ". however , there may still be uncorrected bias .",
    "the mean mass of mwds in the pg could be biased downwards from a true mean mass , since a massive mwd has less chance to be part of the survey than a lower mass mwd in the first place .",
    "thus the relative fraction mwds may be significantly higher still , perhaps approaching 10% . finally , there is also no rigorous way of correcting this fraction upwards for the mwds with field strengths below @xmath12  mg , which generally require spectropolarimetric observations .",
    "the exercise of the previous paragraphs suggests that there may be no significant difference between the fractional incidence of mwds between the hot and cool samples of wds , once the greater correction for bias in the magnitude - limited pg is allowed for .",
    "this would enable us to retain the simpler working hypothesis that the incidence of mwds or mean magnetic field strengths do not increase as the wds cool .",
    "it is not surprising that the majority of the local sample are cool wds .",
    "arguably , liebert & sion ( 1978 ) were simply detecting the greater mwd frequency of the more volume - complete sample of solar wd neighbors , as do holberg , oswalt , & sion ( 2002 ) .",
    "however , one final test is possible : if the local wd sample is close to being complete , is there any significant difference between the @xmath10 distribution of the mwds vs the sample as a whole ?    to perform this test , we have collected @xmath10 and mass estimates for nearly all of the local sample , although we concede that this may not be complete for stars more distant than 13  pc .",

    "temperatures for two stars were also taken from brl but with no mass estimate .",
    "this left 12 stars out of 108 without parameter estimates .",
    "for these , we estimated the temperatures based on the published color indices from the mccook & sion ( 1999 ) catalog and the photometric calibration of bergeron , wesemael , & beauchamp ( 1995b ) ; no mass estimates are possible for these .",

    "we plot the estimated @xmath10 values vs. mass for the local sample .",
    "stars with no mass estimate , generally those whose @xmath10 is taken from the spectral subtype , are plotted at the bottom ( at mass of 0.1 ) .",
    "eleven of the 69 stars ( 16@xmath305% ) cooler than 8,000  k are magnetic , while only one of 32 wds ( 3@xmath303% ) hotter than this temperature is a mwd .",
    "this is therefore only about a two sigma difference . for the majority with mass estimates",
    ", we also can evaluate the fraction vs. evolution time , and the isochrones are displayed in the figure .",
    "only one mwd ( grw+70@xmath24  8247 ) has a cooling time less than 1  gyr , and only just barely .",
    "while the sample is relatively small , the radius bias of the apparent - magnitude limited samples may not be the whole story .",
    "we acknowledge the possibility that an unknown physical mechanism causes the fractional incidence of mwds to increase with decreasing @xmath10 , luminosity and/or cooling age .",
    "two possible causes are discussed briefly in valyavin & fabrika ( 1999 ) , who presented similar arguments about observed samples of wds .",
    "the total fraction of mwds will increase more if precise spectropolarimetric analyses capable of detecting fields down to @xmath110  kg are applied to samples like these .",
    "precise observations need to be applied to a larger , complete sample of wds at all temperatures and cooling ages .",

    "<S> we study the incidence of magnetism in white dwarfs from three large and well - observed samples of hot , cool and nearby white dwarfs in order to test whether the fraction of magnetic degenerates is biased , and whether it varies with effective temperature , cooling age , or distance . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic fraction is considerably higher for the cool sample of bergeron , ruiz , & leggett , and the holberg , oswalt , & sion sample of local white dwarfs than it is for the generally - hotter white dwarfs of the palomar green survey . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the mean mass of magnetic white dwarfs in this survey is 0.93  @xmath0 or more , so there may be a strong bias _ against _ their selection in the magnitude - limited palomar green survey . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this bias is not as important in the samples of cool and nearby white dwarfs . </S>",
    "<S> however , this bias may not account for all of the difference in the magnetic fractions of these samples .    </S>",
    "<S> it is not clear that the magnetic white dwarfs in the cool and local samples are drawn from the same population as the hotter pg stars . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two or three of the cool sample are low - mass white dwarfs in unresolved binary systems . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , there is a suggestion from the local sample that the fractional incidence may increase with decreasing temperature , luminosity , and/or cooling age . </S>",
    "<S> overall , the true incidence of magnetism at the level of @xmath12  mg or greater is at least @xmath110% , and it could be higher . </S>",
    "<S> limited studies capable of detecting lower field strengths down to @xmath110  kg suggest by implication that the total fraction may be substantially higher then 10% . </S>"
