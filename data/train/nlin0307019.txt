    "the dynamics of the hydrogenic electron can be modeled classically by an area - preserving map on a two - dimensional phase plane .",
    "this map exhibits a prominent homoclinic tangle ( see below ) , which organizes the dynamics , leading to phase space transport and eventually escape .",
    "the mechanism of escape via a tangle is a common model for many classical systems . in this paper",
    ", we consider the general problem of escape for an arbitrary map possessing a homoclinic tangle exhibiting the basic structure shown in fig .",
    "[ fsossc ] .",
    "the map in fig .  [ fsossc ] has an unstable fixed point ( -point ) @xmath1 , with a pair of stable and unstable manifolds attached to it .",
    "these manifolds are invariant curves containing all points that asymptote to @xmath2 under forward and backward iterates , respectively @xcite .",
    "the curves intersect transversely at the point @xmath3 .",
    "the `` complex '' is the region bounded by the segments of the stable and unstable manifolds joining @xmath2 to @xmath3 ; escape is defined as mapping out of the complex . as explained by poincar , the transverse intersection @xmath3 produces a homoclinic tangle . between successive intersection points @xmath4 and @xmath5 , the manifolds bound lobes denoted @xmath6 and @xmath7 in fig .",
    "[ fsossc ] . as these lobes are mapped forward or backward ,",
    "their widths are compressed and their lengths are stretched ; they become long and thin and develop intricate twisted shapes .",
    "the resulting complex structure of the intersecting stable and unstable manifolds is called a homoclinic tangle .",
    "an important aspect of any classical decay problem is the distribution of initial points in phase space .",
    "when modeling the breakup of molecular collision complexes , for example , one normally assumes that the complex is more - or - less in thermal equilibrium .",
    "a microcanonical distribution of initial probability might be used within the collision complex , with equal probabilities in equal areas , or perhaps some other smooth distribution . however , in most experiments on excited atoms in strong fields , the initial distribution is quite different .",
    "the electron attains a high energy by single - photon excitation from a localized strongly - bound initial state @xcite .",
    "the trajectories therefore start close to the nucleus and go out in all directions .",
    "this initial distribution is well modeled by assuming that all electrons begin exactly at the nucleus , with constant energy , and with a smooth distribution of outgoing directions @xcite . in the phase plane , this yields a distribution of initial states along a _ line _ of initial conditions .",
    "thus , we assume that the initial distribution of states in phase space lies along some curve @xmath8 , the details of which depend on the problem at hand .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fsossc ] . ) along this curve there is some initial density of points ; for hydrogen this density represents the initial angular distribution of outgoing electrons @xcite .    we plot the number of iterates @xmath9 needed to escape as a function along the line of initial conditions @xmath8 , forming an _ escape - time plot _ , as shown in fig .  [ fepsc ] .",
    "each line segment in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] represents an interval , or _",
    "escape segment _ , of @xmath8 , in which all points escape the complex at the same iterate .",
    "the escape - time plot is clearly a very complicated function with `` fractal '' properties ; this fractal structure is created by the repeated intersections of the stable manifold with the line of initial conditions .",
    "our objective is to describe certain regular structures within this plot .",

    "epistrophe_. epistrophes have several important properties .",
    "( 1 ) beginning at some initial iterate , each epistrophe contains one escape segment at every subsequent iterate . ( 2 ) each epistrophe converges to some point on @xmath8 . ( 3 ) within a given epistrophe , the lengths of the escape segments decrease geometrically ( in the limit @xmath10 ) with the ratio of successive lengths converging to the liapunov factor ( i.e. the largest eigenvalue ) @xmath11 of the -point .",
    "this is true regardless of which epistrophe we analyze .",
    "the epistrophes form hierarchical sequences  we see in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] that the endpoints of each escape segment serve as the limit points for epistrophes beginning at higher iterate number .",
    "for example , consider epistrophe , which begins at @xmath12 ( around @xmath13 ) and progresses upward , containing segments at @xmath14 . upon each of the two endpoints of the first segment ( @xmath12 )",
    ", there converges another epistrophe which begins at @xmath15 .",
    "similarly , the second segment of epistrophe ( @xmath16 ) has an epistrophe converging upon each of its endpoints , beginning at @xmath17 .",
    "in fact , every escape segment has an epistrophe which converges upon each of its endpoints .",
    "thus , epistrophes appear throughout the escape - time plot and on all scales .",
    "the main result of this paper is the epistrophe theorem ( sect .",
    "[ sepistrophes ] ) , which proves and elaborates upon the above observations for an arbitrary homoclinic tangle and an arbitrary line of initial conditions .",
    "the beginning of each epistrophe is not described by the epistrophe theorem , leaving a certain unpredictability in how an epistrophe starts .",
    "what is described is the asymptotic behavior of the tail of the epistrophe .",
    "in fact , we prove that , up to an overall rescaling , the asymptotic tails of all epistrophes are identical ; we characterize these tails with geometric quantities ( @xmath11 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 in theorem [ t5 ] ) .",
    "the recursive nature of the epistrophe theorem and the scaling relation between the epistrophe tails implies a certain self - similarity to the escape - time plot .",
    "however , the epistrophe theorem is itself not strong enough to imply true self - similarity ( or even asymptotic self - similarity ) .",
    "our data indicate that there may be numerous escape segments , which we call `` strophes '' , that do not belong to _ any _ epistrophe and that even tend to dominate the escape - time plot at long times .",
    "several such strophes are indicated by asterisks in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] .",
    "we can thus say that the epistrophe theorem implies a kind of `` epistrophic '' self - similarity : epistrophes ( self - similar sequences ) occur on all scales , but there may also be additional segments , or strophes , that persist ( and may even dominate ) in the asymptotic limit .    on the left - hand side of fig .",

    "indeed , this is readily seen in the `` standard '' smale horseshoe ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    strict self - similarity and asymptotic self - similarity are consistent with the epistrophe theorem and the epistrophe start rule , but they are not guaranteed by these results .",
    "first , these results allow the beginnings of the epistrophes to contain irregular lengths that do not follow any simple pattern . indeed in our numerical studies",
    "we do not see any simple pattern to the lengths of the first segment of an epistrophe .",
    "more importantly , we find additional , unpredicted strophe segments which are not part of the minimal set , and which therefore do not fit the pattern of the minimal set . furthermore , numerical evidence seems to indicate that these strophe segments tend to dominate at long times .",
    "it is possible , and even likely , that the strophes obey some higher - order and more complex recursive rules .",
    "if one could uncover these rules , one might hope to find a deeper and more complex kind of asymptotic self - similarity in the escape - time plot ; one might hope that there would be a finite number of such rules .",
    "however , it is generally acknowledged @xcite that to describe the topology of a tangle requires a countable infinity of topological parameters , reflecting the growing topological complexity of the tangle on finer and finer scales .",
    "this situation is nicely described by rckerl and jung @xcite .",
    "thus , for any finite description of the tangle , one expects eventually to discover in the escape - time plot additional structure which had not yet been predicted and which eventually comes to dominate the structure that is predicted .",
    "we use the term `` epistrophic self - similarity '' to describe the above situation : throughout the escape - time plot and on all scales there are epistrophes ; they are all asymptotically self - similar and each is similar to every other",
    ". however , there may also be unpredicted strophe segments which also occur on all scales and which may come to dominate the regular epistrophe structure .",
    "what is the distinction between asymptotic and epistrophic self - similarity ?",
    "a fractal has asymptotic self - similarity if through repeated magnifications about any point of the fractal , the pattern converges to an asymptotic structure .",
    "epistrophic self - similarity is weaker , requiring only the existence of epistrophes , as described above .",

    "thus far , we have focused on the segments of @xmath8 that escape the complex .",
    "the question remains : how do the epistrophes influence the points that survive and never escape ?",
    "jung and scholz observed that the stable manifolds of all the bound orbits give rise to a cantor set of singularities for a scattering function @xcite .",

    "the line of initial conditions @xmath8 runs through the complex and may intersect some of the above - mentioned sets of surviving points , while missing others .",
    "certainly , @xmath8 intersects the stable manifold of @xmath2 an infinite number of times .",
    "we also expect that @xmath8 may intersect the set @xmath113 of stable islands .",
    "each such intersection will produce an open segment of @xmath8 which does not escape , bounded by surviving endpoints which are part of the shoreline of @xmath113 .",
    "these are the _ only _ generic intervals of @xmath8 known to us that do not escape , and we often simply assume this case @xcite .    the epistrophe theorem yields specific results about the structure of the set @xmath114 of surviving points of @xmath8 .",
    "the set of escaping points is denoted @xmath115 .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fsets ] . ) since each escape segment is open , the set @xmath115 is also open @xcite .",
    "the set @xmath114 , being everything not in @xmath115 , is closed ( and hence compact . )    we define @xmath116 to be the interior of the set @xmath114 ; that is , @xmath116 is the union of all open sets in @xmath114 . as noted above , generically @xmath116",
    "consists entirely of points in the interior of stable islands .",
    "any surviving point not in @xmath116 we put in a set denoted @xmath117 , so @xmath117 contains whatever points of @xmath8 survive , other than open intervals ; all points in @xmath117 are unstably surviving .",
    "the set @xmath117 is constructed by the following process . after a finite number @xmath104 of iterates of the map ,",
    "a finite number of escape segments will have been removed ( assuming that @xmath118 is analytic . ) between these escape segments are intervals that have managed to survive for @xmath104 iterates . as we continue to iterate the map , we remove subintervals of these surviving intervals . in the limit , if there are any surviving intervals , we put them into the set @xmath116 .",
    "what remains is @xmath117 .",
    "this is very much like the construction of the cantor middle - third set .",
    "in fact , we demonstrate below that @xmath117 is a _ topological _ cantor set .",
    "a topological cantor set is any set which is homeomorphic to a subset of the real line and which is compact ( i.e. closed and bounded ) , perfect ( i.e. containing no isolated points ) , and totally disconnected ( i.e. containing no intervals)@xcite .",
    "all cantor sets are homeomorphic ( topologically equivalent ) to each other @xcite , so when thinking about the topology of cantor sets , it is sufficient to imagine the middle - third cantor set . cantor sets may differ in their metric structure , that is , in the lengths and separations of the segments that are deleted to form the set , and different metric structures will in general result in different fractal dimensions of the set .",
    "we assume in the following that @xmath8 is nowhere tangent to the stable manifold ; the results can be modified to account for such tangencies , but it obfuscates our discussion .",
    "the set @xmath117 is a cantor set because it satisfies the three necessary requirements : ( 1 ) it is closed and bounded , i.e. compact ( by its definition . ) ( 2 ) it is totally disconnected , i.e. contains no intervals ( because they have been explicitly excluded . )",
    "( 3 ) it is perfect , i.e. contains no isolated points .",
    "the third assertion follows from the epistrophe theorem . if there were an isolated surviving point , then directly on its right there would have to be a ( connected ) open interval of escaping points .",
    "but any such interval must lie inside a single escape segment .",
    "hence , the isolated point must be the left endpoint of that escape segment and an intersection between @xmath8 and @xmath28 ( which is transverse by assumption . ) therefore , the point must have an epistrophe converging upon its left side , which implies that the point is in fact not isolated .",
    "the fractal @xmath117 is the mutual boundary of the sets @xmath114 and @xmath115 .",
    "topologically , the boundary of a set @xmath119 is the closure of @xmath119 ( i.e. the smallest closed set containing @xmath119 ) minus the interior of @xmath119 ( i.e. the largest open set contained in @xmath119 . ) by definition , @xmath117 is the boundary of @xmath114 .",
    "we see that @xmath117 is the boundary of @xmath115 because any point in @xmath117 must have a point in @xmath115 arbitrarily close to it , otherwise it would be in the interior @xmath116 of @xmath114 .",
    "we can now summarize the situation as follows : inside the complex , the line of initial conditions is partitioned into three sets : ( 1 ) the set @xmath116 of all open surviving intervals , ( 2 ) the set @xmath115 of all open escaping intervals , and ( 3 ) their mutual boundary @xmath117 ; this boundary is a cantor set .",
    "like all cantor sets , @xmath117 can be divided into two subsets consisting of the _ accessible _ and _ inaccessible _ points .",
    "the fractal @xmath117 is a line segment with a countable number of open intervals removed , some being escape segments of @xmath115 and some being ( generically ) interiors of islands in @xmath116 . an endpoint of an escape segment is said to be accessible from @xmath115 because there exists a path beginning in @xmath115 and terminating on the endpoint without encountering any other point outside of @xmath115 ; we denote the countably infinite set of points accessible from @xmath115 by @xmath120 .",
    "similarly an endpoint of a segment in @xmath116 is said to be accessible from @xmath116 , and we denote the set of such points by @xmath121 .",
    "the set @xmath121 may be countably infinite , finite , or empty .",
    "together @xmath120 and @xmath121 form the countably infinite set @xmath122 of accessible points of @xmath117 ( i.e. the set of all endpoints of deleted intervals , whether in @xmath115 or @xmath116 . )",
    "since the fractal @xmath117 is uncountably infinite , most points in @xmath117 lie in the set , denoted @xmath123 , of inaccessible points .",
    "every point of @xmath120 lies on the stable manifold and hence has an epistrophe converging upon it .",
    "however , the points of @xmath121 generically do not lie on the stable manifold , but are rather part of the shoreline of @xmath113 .",
    "so we do not expect epistrophes to converge upon the endpoints of a surviving segment of @xmath8 .",
    "( this is readily apparent in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] . )",
    "nevertheless , the epistrophes are dense in the fractal , or more precisely , the set @xmath120 is dense in @xmath117 .    because the escape segments exhibit what we called epistrophic self - similarity in sect .",
    "[ sselfsimilarity ] and because @xmath117 is a cantor set , we call @xmath117 an _ epistrophic fractal_.",
    "the epistrophe theorem predicts the existence of an epistrophe converging geometrically upon the endpoint of any escape segment ; it also characterizes the asymptotic behavior of the convergence in terms of geometric quantities @xmath11 and @xmath18 .",
    "however , none of our present results say anything about how an epistrophe begins .",
    "most notably , we do not predict the iterate at which an epistrophe starts , and we certainly do not estimate the lengths or separation distances of the early escape segments .    to understand the early behavior of an epistrophe",
    ", we must look at the global topology of the tangle , which is the topic of the following paper . in that paper",
    ", we prove that another pattern appears in the escape - time plots : the first segment @xmath124 of an epistrophe is spawned at some number of iterates @xmath112 later than the segment @xmath125 upon which the epistrophe converges .",
    "( this fact was observed by tiyapan and jaff @xcite and by jung and coworkers @xcite for certain lines of initial conditions in scattering problems . )",
    "this pattern is clearly visible in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] with @xmath126 .",
    "the pattern follows from the fact that the topological structure of the map forces the existence of a certain minimal required set of escape segments ; this minimal set can be shown to have the stated recursive pattern , for @xmath9 sufficiently large .",
    "typically there are additional escape segments ( strophes ) not predicted by the pattern ; some of these unpredicted segments are marked by asterisks in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] . nevertheless , the minimal set seems to characterize the early structure of the escape - time plots remarkably well .",
    "however , based on numerical evidence , we believe that for large enough iterate number , the minimal set will eventually be overwhelmed by the unpredicted segments , both in total number at a given iterate and in total measure .",
    "( notice that the unpredicted segments in fig .",
    "[ fepsc ] tend to be the longer segments at high iterate number . )    in future papers , we shall also present theorems concerning the winding number ( fig .  [ fepsc ] ) , and we shall show how all these concepts describe the ionization of a hydrogen atom placed in external electric and magnetic fields .",
    "we conclude by noting that standard references on fractals  @xcite discuss at least three distinct types of self - similarity : ( 1 ) regular self - similarity , as for the cantor middle - third set or the koch snowflake ; ( 2 ) asymptotic self - similarity , which characterizes , for example , sequences of period - doubling bifurcations ; ( 3 ) statistical self - similarity , which might describe coastlines or clouds . to this list",
    "we add `` epistrophic self - similarity '' , in which at all levels of resolution there are asymptotically similar sequences , but additional unpredicted segments may also persist .",

    "<S> we consider a dynamical system given by an area - preserving map on a two - dimensional phase plane and consider a one - dimensional line of initial conditions within this plane . </S>",
    "<S> we record the number of iterates it takes a trajectory to escape from a bounded region of the plane as a function along the line of initial conditions , forming an `` escape - time plot '' . for a chaotic system , this plot is in general not a smooth function , but rather has many singularities at which the escape time is infinite ; these singularities form a complicated fractal set . in this article </S>",
    "<S> we prove the existence of regular repeated sequences , called `` epistrophes '' , which occur at all levels of resolution within the escape - time plot . </S>",
    "<S> ( the word `` epistrophe '' comes from rhetoric and means `` a repeated ending following a variable beginning '' . ) </S>",
    "<S> the epistrophes give the escape - time plot a certain self - similarity , called `` epistrophic '' self - similarity , which need not imply either strict or asymptotic self - similarity .    </S>",
    "<S> chaotic transport , and the escape of trajectories from defined regions of phase space , has been an important topic in dynamics for many years , because it describes phenomena that occur in many branches of physics . </S>",
    "<S> for example , some meteorites that fell on antarctica are believed to have come from mars ; how they escaped from mars gravitational field is a problem in the theory of chaotic transport@xcite . at a smaller scale , </S>",
    "<S> one of the important topics in nanophysics is ballistic transport of electrons through a small junction : electrons enter a junction from one lead , bounce around within the junction following either regular or chaotic paths , and eventually find their way to an exit lead@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a closely related problem is chaotic propagation of light rays in a distorted cylindrical glass bead@xcite . at the molecular level </S>",
    "<S> , we may think about the breakup of a temporarily - bound complex , such as a he atom weakly bound to an @xmath0 molecule@xcite . at the atomic level , the ionization of an excited hydrogen atom in applied electric and magnetic fields is an ideal candidate for the laboratory study of chaotic transport@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can learn many of the properties of chaotic transport by studying area - preserving maps of the plane . </S>",
    "<S> we examine the time required to escape from a specified region of the plane , plotted as a function along a given line of initial conditions . within this escape - time plot </S>",
    "<S> , we study regular sequences of escaping intervals , which we call `` epistrophes '' . </S>"
