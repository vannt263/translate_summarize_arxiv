    "in theories where matter confines to a 4-d brane and gravity is the only massless field able to propagate along the extra dimensional volume , one generally expects short distance corrections to the usual 4-d newtonian potential .",
    "the shape and distance at which these corrections become relevant generally depend on the geometry and size of the extra dimensional volume , thus allowing for distinctive signals dependent of the particular content of the theory .",
    "for instance , in the single - brane randall - sundrum scenario @xcite , where a 4-d brane of constant tension @xmath4 is immersed in an infinitely large ads@xmath5 volume , a zero mode graviton @xmath6 localizes about the brane .",
    "this zero mode is exponentially suppressed away from the brane with a warp factor @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the distance from the brane along the fifth extra - dimensional direction .",
    "the newtonian potential describing the gravitational interaction between two bodies of masses @xmath9 and @xmath10 in the brane , and separated by a distance @xmath11 , is then found to be @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is newton s constant .",
    "the correction @xmath14 springs out directly from the way in which gravitons propagate in an ads@xmath5 spacetime .",
    "if the tension @xmath15 is small enough as compared to the planck mass @xmath16 , then it would be possible to distinguish this type of scenario from other extra - dimensional models in short distance tests of gravity .",
    "present tests @xcite give the robust constraint @xmath17 m .",
    "it is therefore sensible to ask how other braneworld scenarios may differ from the randall - sundrum case at short distances , especially within the context of more realistic models . in what follows",
    "we address this question for a fairly general class of supersymmetric braneworld scenarios with a bulk scalar field , where the geometry of the extra - dimensional space differs from the usual ads profile .",
    "we show that the newtonian potential for this type of models picks up a non - trivial correction at scales comparable to the tension of the brane @xcite , that differs dramatically from the one shown in eq .",

    "let us consider a 5-d spacetime @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is a fixed 4-d lorentzian manifold and @xmath20 is the orbifold constructed from a circle with points identified through a @xmath21-symmetry .",
    "@xmath22 is bounded by two 3-branes , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , located at the fixed points of @xmath20 .",
    "there is a bulk scalar field @xmath0 with a bulk potential @xmath25 and boundary values @xmath26 and @xmath27 at the branes .",

    "@xmath39 is the 5-d fundamental mass scale and @xmath40 is the 5-d ricci scalar .",
    "additionally , @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the brane tensions .",
    "our interest is focused on a class of models embedded in supergravity , where the bulk potential @xmath25 and the brane tensions @xmath41 and @xmath42 satisfy a special relation so as to preserve half of the local supersymmetry near the branes @xcite .",
    "this is @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the superpotential of the system . under these conditions the system presents an important property : there is a bps vacuum state consisting of a static bulk background in which the branes can be allocated anywhere , without obstruction . indeed , suppose a metric @xmath45 , where @xmath8 parameterizes the extra - dimension and @xmath6 is the induced metric on the 4-d foliations of @xmath22 parallel to the branes .",
    "if the bulk fields depend only on @xmath8 and @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 the minkowski metric ) then one finds that the entire system is solved by functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 satisfying @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",
    "remarkably , boundary conditions at the fixed points are also given by these two equations .",
    "thus , the presence of the branes forces the system to acquire a domain - wall - like vacuum background , instead of a flat 5-d minkowski background .",
    "let us mention here that in order to have the right phenomenology in this type of scenarios , it is important to have the moduli @xmath52 and @xmath53 stabilized ( in the 4-d effective low energy theory , they are found to be massless and dangerously coupled to matter @xcite ) .",
    "this can be done in a simple way by breaking supersymmetry on the branes in an appropriate manner @xcite .",
    "it is possible to compute the modifications to newton s law arising from the way in which bulk gravitons propagate in a background given by eq .",
