    "this is because small @xmath39 corresponds to small @xmath0 as explained above .",
    "these results indicate that @xmath312 is slightly enhanced below @xmath17 while @xmath323 is suppressed .    in order to illustrate these anisotropic fluctuations , the density isosurface for @xmath332 and the density ( color ) map",
    "are shown for two different parameters at @xmath324 in fig .",
    "[ fig-3dfig ] : for ( a ) and ( b ) , @xmath325 and @xmath333 , and @xmath326 and @xmath334 , respectively , and these two sets give the same @xmath335 , and we choose the two parameter sets to emphasize the change in the oscillation profile . as expected from the values of @xmath0 , the case ( a ) has the smaller @xmath336 and the larger @xmath337 , while @xmath338 and @xmath339 for the case ( b ) .",
    "one can see that the density isosurface shows more anisotropic character in the case ( b ) , where the `` spikes '' sticking out along four [ 111 ] directions are sharper than those in the case ( a ) .",
    "this aspect reflects in the values of @xmath277 and @xmath6 . indeed , @xmath277 at @xmath223 is larger @xmath340 in ( a ) than @xmath341 in ( b ) , while @xmath323 at @xmath223 is smaller @xmath342 in ( a ) than @xmath343 in ( b ) .",
    "figures [ fig-3dfig](c)-[fig-3dfig](e ) show @xmath96 along [ 111 ] , [ 001 ] , and [ 110 ] directions , respectively , for the same two data .",
    "it is clearly seen that @xmath323 in ( b ) is larger than that in ( a ) as shown in ( c ) , and @xmath312 in ( a ) is larger than in ( b ) as shown in ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "these changes in the anisotropy of density distribution is a characteristic nature of the first - order isomorphic transition at @xmath17 .",
    "this transition is isomorphic , consistent with the experiments,@xcite because the amplitude of anisotropy changes but it does not break the point group , translational , and any other symmetries .",
    "our results suggest that @xmath312 is slightly enhanced while @xmath323 is suppressed below @xmath17 in kos@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "recent high - resolution neutron - scattering experiment shows the increase in @xmath312 across @xmath17 as @xmath81 decreases,@xcite which is consistent with our result .",
    "furthermore , although it is naively expected that an increase in @xmath312 corresponds to the enhancement of @xmath4 , this does not necessarily hold in this system , since the value of @xmath4 is sensitive to the value of @xmath0 , especially near the crossover point @xmath226 .",
    "our results show that the value of @xmath323 plays more important role for the enhancement of @xmath4 than @xmath312 . in order to detect this change in the density distribution across @xmath17 ,",
    "it is important to perform detailed neutron - scattering experiments and to analyze the results with taking into account the third - order term in debye - waller factor as discussed in sec .",
    "[ debye - waller ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to examine the @xmath104 dependence of the debye - waller factor to extract the anisotropy of the oscillations , since @xmath104-averaged debye - waller factor hinders the anisotropy and anharmonicity .    finally , we comment on the possibility of re - entrant superconducting transition .",
    "experimentally , hiroi _",
    "et al._,@xcite observed a re - entrant superconducting transition around @xmath344 t as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematichc2 ] . this can be understood from @xmath345 in the strong coupling theory of superconductivity : @xmath346 for the clean limit.@xcite in our analysis , the @xmath4 decreases and @xmath209 increases below @xmath17 , while the @xmath8 is approximately the same for the potential parameters above and below @xmath17 .",
    "thus , @xmath345 for the low-@xmath81 parameter set is smaller than that for the high-@xmath81 set .",
    "therefore , we expect a @xmath347 curve similar to that shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - schematichc2 ] .",
    "this result does not change when we use the formula for the dirty limit.@xcite",

    "first , we have solved the schrdinger equation of the three - dimensional anharmonic phonon in tetrahedral symmetry .",
    "the main issue is the importance of the third - order anharmonicity @xmath348 in the ion potential allowed for this symmetry .",
    "we have determined the energy spectrum of the anharmonic phonon as a function of the third - order anharmonicity @xmath0 .",
    "we have found that there exists a crossover of the ground state to the quantum tunneling state for @xmath63 .",
    "we have pointed out non - monotonic temperature dependence of ion density profile near the crossover point @xmath226 .",
    "secondly , we have calculated the transition temperature of superconductivity @xmath8 mediated by these anharmonic phonons .",
    "we have found that the enhancement of @xmath8 near @xmath62 .",
    "its @xmath0 dependence can be well fitted by the mcmillan formula at @xmath227 .",
    "for @xmath349 we have found that there exists an additional channel of pairing interaction , which turns out to originate from low - energy excited states appearing at @xmath350 .",
    "we have analyzed its contribution and derived an approximated formula of @xmath8 in the strong coupling limit .",
    "we have also discussed the chemical trends of @xmath8 in the @xmath7-pyrochlore family @xmath12os@xmath1o@xmath2 ( @xmath12=k , rb , or cs ) .",
    "the main difference among the three members are different values of @xmath267 and the second - order term in the ion potential @xmath39 . by assuming the same electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath196 and the same high - energy phonon for all the three compounds , the differences in @xmath8 and the energy of the first excited phonon states @xmath3",
    "have been quantitatively explained only by the difference in the local anharmonic potential .",
    "finally , we have discussed the effect of the first - order transition observed in kos@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the changes in the density distribution of k cation at the first - order transition have been discussed based on the experimental data obtained so far .",
    "especially , we have found that @xmath277 and @xmath323 change differently across @xmath17 .",
    "our results suggest the increase in the first excited phonon energy @xmath3 and the reduction in the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath4 across @xmath17 . while the latter is consistent with the experimental results ,",
    "the former has not been observed and this is our prediction for the experiments . in order to detect the increase in @xmath3 ,",
    "it is important to carry out the high - resolution inelastic neutron scattering experiments .",
