    "the development of quantum theory of brownian motion laid the foundation of non - equilibrium statistical mechanics of a system coupled to its environment@xcite .",
    "this has significantly affected the course of research in quantum optics , condensed matter physics and chemical dynamics , over the last several decades@xcite .",
    "although its major thrust lies on calculation of non - equilibrium properties in terms of relevant correlation functions , a few interesting attempts have been made in evaluating thermodynamic quantities of small quantum system coupled to its environment which exerts a finite dissipation on the system .",
    "for example , the free energy of a quantum oscillator interacting via dipole coupling to black - body radiation field modes has been calculated@xcite to obtain a temperature - dependent shift in the free energy resulting in modification of planck s formula .",
    "the effects of dissipation on thermodynamic functions have been explored for quantum oscillators in contact with ohmic and non - ohmic reservoirs@xcite and for the magnetic moment of an electron gas@xcite .",
    "it has also been shown that while a classical free particle does not obey third law of thermodynamics@xcite its coupling to a thermal reservoir renders quantum nature and allows recovery of third law@xcite .",
    "that quantum dissipation helps to ensure the validity of third law has been a major finding for a dissipative quantum oscillator@xcite , for which the specific heat at low temperature exhibits power law behaviour .",
    "the focus of the present paper is the calculation of thermodynamic functions , particularly the specific heat of a spin-@xmath0 particle coupled to a spin bath . to bring forth the discussion in an appropriate perspective we first note the following points .",
    "when a small system is made open by coupling it to an environment the system experiences a dissipative flow of energy into the environment .",
    "it is easy to anticipate that such a flux would give rise to a dynamical correction over the usual thermodynamic contribution responsible for the temperature dependence of the system , a situation reminiscent of kramer s theory of activated rate processes@xcite . in the later case",
    "the rate constant is essentially a product of the equilibrium contribution due to transition state theory and a dynamical factor due to the frictional coefficient characteristic of the thermal bath@xcite .",
    "it is possible to realize the nature of dynamical corrections over the thermodynamic functions by spatially restricting the system size when the fluctuations of the internal energy of the system can be quite significant . in this paper",
    "we focus on the dynamics of an open spin system experiencing spin - bath induced dissipative effects@xcite as an underlying microscopic description of this behaviour . to be specific",
    ", the behaviour of specific heat for small systems can be analysed by examining the finite size effects of the system@xcite .",
    "the strategy for calculation is based on the free energy of the spin system coupled to the spin bath@xcite minus the free energy of the spin bath in absence of the system .",
    "the desired free energy of the interacting spin system turns out to be an integral over the free energy of a single system multiplied by a density of states related to the susceptibility@xcite derived explicitly from the associated c - number quantum langevin equation . for implementing the scheme we have employed the spin coherent state representation@xcite of our proposed hamiltonian of the spin - spin - bath model to cast the c - number hamiltonian into an oscillator - oscillator bath model .",
    "the key point is the use of holstein - primakoff transformation@xcite which sets up a mapping between spin and boson operators .",
    "interestingly this allows us to recover the traditional form of quantum langevin equation ( its noise correlation , however , is guided by the spin characteristics of the bath ) and consequently the associated susceptibility .",
    "we derive the explicit analytic expression of the specific heat and its high and low temperature limits , which carry the signature of dissipative effect of the environment .",
    "it has been shown that specific heat can be expressed as a sum of the products of an equilibration factor that contains the usual temperature dependence and a dynamical correction factor characteristic of the dissipative flow of energy from the system .",
    "finally , our analysis is correlated with finite size effects on the variation of specific heat with temperature characterized by abrupt transition as one passes from low to high temperature regime .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : we introduce the spin - spin - bath model and the associated hamiltonian followed by its spin coherent state representation in sec ii .",
    "the basis of this analysis is the holestein - primakopff transformation which further allows us to map the problem to an oscillator - oscillator - bath hamiltonian .",
    "the c - number quantum langevin equation is a direct consequence of this mapping . in sec iii",
    "we calculate the thermodynamic functions , free energy and specific heat for the interacting spin system and the high and low temperature limits of the derived expressions and correlated them with dynamical factors characterized by system size .",
    "the paper is concluded in sec iv .",
    "to set up the problem of quantum dissipation of a two - level system in a sea of a two - level atoms , we consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath1 here the first term is the hamiltonian for the system , which is specified by the pauli population difference operator @xmath2 , the other operators being @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the usual raising and lowering operators and @xmath5 is the identity operator .",
    "the second term corresponds to the reservoir hamiltonian ; the bath operators are denoted by @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( the subscript refers to the k - th atom of the bath ) .",
    "the last term represents the interaction between the system and the bath atoms .",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath10 are the characteristic frequencies of the two - level system and the k - th two - level bath atom . @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the coupling constant and a frequency scale factor ( this is a necessity for correct normalization of the spin coherent states used in the next section ) .",
    "the pauli operators for the system follow the usual commutation relations as given by : @xmath13=2\\hat{s}_z ; [ \\hat{s}^\\dagger,\\hat{s}_z]=-\\hat{s}^\\dagger ; [ \\hat{s},\\hat{s}_z]=\\hat{s}\\ ] ]    we have @xmath14 , and @xmath15 .",
    "the commutation and anti - commutation rules between the spin-@xmath16 operators are given by , @xmath17 so , @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number operator @xmath20 . the anti - commutation relation in eq .",
    "has the immediate consequence that spin-@xmath16 particle or two - level atom obey fermi - dirac statistics . in view of eqs . and",
    "the system hamiltonian @xmath21 may also be expressed as @xmath22 , while the eigen - value equation for the number operator may be written as @xmath23 with n=0,1 .",
    "the general state with no quanta is denoted by @xmath24 which satisfies @xmath25 and @xmath26 and the state with one quantum is denoted by @xmath27 which obeys @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "similar relations hold good for bath operators .",
    "note that unlike harmonic oscillator , the hamiltonian is asymmetric , both for the system and the bath and the hilbert space is two - dimensional .",
    "our object in the next section is to construct a c - number hamiltonian from eq . using spin coherent state representation as introduced by radcliffe@xcite a couple of decades ago .",
    "application of spin coherent states are well known in the context of ferromagnetic spin wave , phase transition in dicke model of super - radiance , equilibrium statistical mechanics of radiation - matter interaction and so on . for details",
    "we refer to klauder and skagerstam@xcite .",
    "now we return to eq . and carry out quantum mechanical averaging with product separable coherent states of the system and the bath at t=0 , @xmath30 , where @xmath31 denotes the coherent state of the two - level system and @xmath32 corresponds to the coherent state of the k - th bath atom .",
    "the normalized spin coherent state @xmath33 is defined as , @xmath34 where the ground state @xmath35 corresponds to the state with minimal projection @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the c - number . in using the coherent state representation of the hamiltonian",
    ", we express the identity operator in eq . in terms of the system operators ; @xmath38 here we have used the anti - commutation relation of the spin-@xmath16 or two - level system operators . the consequence of expressing the identity operator as will be clear immediately .",
    "the set of c - numbers for the bath degrees of freedom @xmath39 , k = 1,2, ... @xmath40 , obtained from the different matrix elements , as discussed in @xcite , can then be expressed in terms of momenta @xmath41 and coordinates @xmath42 of bath oscillators , using the transformation as @xmath43 and @xmath44 . here",
    "@xmath45 is defined as @xmath46 similarly for the system oscillator co - ordinate @xmath47 and momentum @xmath48 can be expressed as @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "then the hamiltonian in the coherent state variables can be expressed in terms of these redefined quantities as , @xmath51 where @xmath52 is given by @xmath53 or @xmath54 after discarding the irrelevant constant terms .",
    "the above hamiltonian is different from our starting hamiltonian operator equation because of the c - number nature of the coherent state variables .",
    "it is thus possible to reduce the quantum dynamics of a spin-@xmath16 particle in a sea of spin - bath to the dynamics of a particle in an oscillator bath .",
    "this reduction is realizable in view of the well known kinship between the spin-@xmath16 algebra and the algebra of bosons according to schwinger s prescription@xcite . here , we use the radcliffe coherent states , where holstein - primakoff transformation plays a connection between the spin-@xmath16 algebra and boson operators as does the schwinger mapping@xcite .",
    "furthermore , high spin limit of a spin coherent state merges to the harmonic oscillator coherent state@xcite .",
    "the spin - bath as a set of oscillators had been realized explicitly earlier@xcite in a different context .",
    "the hamiltonian is therefore the c - number equivalent of the hamiltonian operator .",
    "thermalization of the spin in a spin bath can thus be conveniently understood in terms of this c - number hamiltonian .",
    "although we have formulated the problem for arbitrary length of bath spin s , it is not possible to see the interpolation of the free energy behaviour between spin-@xmath0 ( s=@xmath0 ) and harmonic oscillators ( s=@xmath40 ) limits .",
    "this is because of the fact the calculation requires imposition of statistics which is applicable only for the two limits , _",
    "i.e. _ fermi - dirac for spin-@xmath0 particle and bose - einstein for the harmonic oscillator systems . in the interpolation regime",
    "it is not clear , a priori , which statistics the system is going to follow .",
    "the equations of motion for the particle and for the bath variables according to the hamiltonian eq .",
    "take the form : @xmath55 solving eq . and substituting in eq . with the condition @xmath56 , we eliminate the bath degrees of freedom to obtain our desired c - number langevin equation for the particle , @xmath57 where , @xmath58 are the memory kernel and noise , respectively .    in order to quantify the properties of the thermal bath , it is convenient to introduce a spectral density function @xmath59 associated with the system - bath interaction .",
    "@xmath60    in terms of spectral density function @xmath59 , one may rewrite the expressions for memory kernel in eq . as , @xmath61 while the noise @xmath62 must satisfy the characteristics of the spin bath at equilibrium",
    "\\omega(t - t ' ) \\label{e2:15}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to ensure that the c - number noise @xmath62 is zero - centred ( eq . ) and satisfies fluctuation - dissipation relation ( eq . ) , it is necessary to assume a canonical distribution of gaussian form for statistical averaging @xmath64 over c - number bath variables as follows : @xmath65 this is the spin bath counterpart@xcite of wigner canonical thermal distribution function@xcite for the harmonic or bosonic bath . here",
    "n is the normalization constant .",
    "the width of distribution is given by @xmath66 , which is related to the average thermal excitation number @xmath67 of the bath as @xmath68 , @xmath67 being fermi - dirac distribution function .",
    "the width of wigner distribution on the other hand is determined by @xmath69 .",
    "note that at t=0 , both distributions merge at a single value .",
    "the differences begin to appear at finite temperatures . at high temperatures",
    ", coth - factor reduces to a factor that results in the recovery of the classical limit . on the other hand the distribution ( eq . ) for the spin bath",
    "therefore the thermalization of the particle in a spin - bath can be described by this canonical thermal distribution and the c - number hamiltonian ( eq.[e2:6 ] ) .",
    "here we derive the expression for specific heat ( @xmath70 ) of a spin - spin - bath system using normal mode frequencies and examine the high and low temperature limits .",
    "we expect from the discussions in the previous section , that at low temperatures the spin - bath closely follows a bosonic bath while it differs at high temperatures .",
    "we begin by considering the normal mode solutions of eqs . and .",
    "to this end we write , @xmath71 using the solutions in eqs and we obtain , @xmath72 elimination of @xmath73 from eqs . and yields , @xmath74 from the above equation the generalised susceptibility can be defined@xcite as , @xmath75^{-1}\\ ] ] for discrete modes , @xmath76 has poles on the real axis at the normal mode frequencies of the system - plus - bath and has zeros at normal mode frequencies of the bath only .",

    "drawing a hint from this observation , we may therefore emphasize that the above expression for @xmath115 at low temperature pertains to a small system allowing a steady flow of energy from it to the environment in the form of dissipation under a quasi - stationary condition .",
    "secondly , we note that the expression for specific heat matches with that for the well known form for degenerate fermi system , i.e. , @xmath123 , ( a , b being constants ) , so far as the thermal behaviour of the system is concerned .",

    "for smaller values of dissipation constant , i.e. when the system size is small , the transition is marked by a larger jump between the two temperature regimes and a shift towards the lower temperature . for larger values of dissipation",

    "the variation of transition temperature as a function of the ratio of the dissipation constant and characteristic frequency satisfies a linear fit on a semi - logarithmic scale as shown in inset of fig.3 .",
    "we mention , in passing , that the observed correlation between the dynamical factors and the specific heat for finite size systems are reminiscent of the recent experimental results @xcite on the behaviour of specific heat with temperature in cobalt oxide layers and micrograins , characterized by anti - ferromagnetic transition .",
    "one observes significant reduction of magnetic ordering temperature or neel temperature for thin layers , _",
    "i.e. _ for smaller system size . we however , emphasize that this correlation should not be extended further for a quantitative comparison since in our model the spin bath consists of independent spins , whereas the experimental situation corresponds to interacting spins via exchange interaction of order of neel temperature .",
    "a more suitable experimental systems for probing the correlation between dynamical factors and the specific heat may be the two - level system in super - conducting circuits coupled to a fermionic bath@xcite employed for the study of decoherence .",
    "in this work we have examined the behaviour of specific heat of a spin-@xmath0 system coupled to a spin - bath with finite coupling strength .",
    "the basis of our analysis is the mapping of the spin - spin - bath hamiltonian into its oscillator counterpart using holstein - primakoff transformation followed by subsequent diagonalization of the hamiltonian in its coherent state representation .",
    "the derived expression for the specific heat is characterized by the dynamical correction factors over and above the usual thermal equilibrium factors . by tuning the system size it is possible to realize this dynamical contribution to specific heat and its consequences .",
    "we summarize the main conclusions of this study as follows :    \\(i ) the c - number quantum langevin equation assumes exactly the traditional classical looking form , the essential difference , however , lies on the nature of noise characteristics due to the spin - bath .",
    "therefore the susceptibility , the key quantity for calculation of free energy associated with the quantum langevin equation retains also its standard form .",
    "the underlying universality of the spin bath is therefore reflected in the analysis so far as the dynamic behaviour is concerned .",
    "\\(ii ) the expression for specific heat both in the high and low temperature regions appears as a sum of the products of a thermal equilibration factor and a dynamical correction factor the later being a function of the ratio of the friction coefficient and the characteristic frequency of the system . up to a leading order",
    "the specific heat at low temperature can be expressed as @xmath149 which reflects the general behaviour of the degenerate fermi system .",
    "the modification by dissipative contributions due to ohmic bath is very much similar to that for the bosonic bath .",
    "this again highlights the similarities of the behaviour of the spin bath and the harmonic bath as @xmath150 .",
    "\\(iii ) the high temperature behaviour of the spin bath is dominated by thermal saturation of the two levels of the spin system .",
    "up to a leading order the specific heat below saturation temperature can be expressed as @xmath151 .",
    "the result corresponds to the qualitative behaviour of a single spin-@xmath16 system .",
    "the transition between the low and high temperature regimes is marked by abrupt jump accompanied by shift towards lower temperature for smaller dissipation characteristic of the reduced system size .",
    "for higher dissipation _ i.e. _ , in the thermodynamic limit , we observe a smooth crossover of specific heat .",

    "<S> the explicit thermodynamic functions , in particular , the specific heat of a spin system interacting with a spin bath which exerts finite dissipation on the system are determined . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the specific heat is a sum of the products of a thermal equilibration factor that carries the temperature dependence and a dynamical correction factor , characteristic of the dissipative energy flow under steady state from the system . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of specific heat with temperature is accompanied by an abrupt transition that depends on these dynamical factors characteristic of the finite system size . </S>"
