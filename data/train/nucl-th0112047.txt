    "for the study of baryonic systems at densities exceeding the nuclear matter saturation density @xmath1 by several times the understanding not only of the nucleon - nucleon interaction at high densities but also of the hyperon - nucleon and hyperon - hyperon interactions is necessary . unlike the nucleonic sector  which is fairly well under control with high precision meson exchange potentials and dirac - brueckner theory ",
    "almost no scattering experiments are feasible in the strangeness sector for principle reasons .",
    "an extension of baryon - baryon interactions to the s@xmath20 sector on theoretical grounds is thus necessary .",
    "a natural choice here is the use of su(3)@xmath3 .",
    "although su(3)-symmetry is broken on the level of the hadron masses , the relevant su(3 ) charges strangeness and isospin are conserved by the strong baryon - baryon ( bb ) interaction .",
    "one can therefore expect that on the level of the coupling constants this symmetry might hold to a reasonable degree of accuracy , too . nevertheless , even assuming exact su(3 ) invariance for the bb interactions does not yield an unique fixing of the relations between couplings ( as is already the case for the isospin in the nn sector ) .",
    "points left open by symmetry considerations are the pseudo - scalar / pseudo - vector ratio , the @xmath4 ratio and the scalar sector .",
    "especially the scalar sector requires a separate effort of modelling since none of the particles of a scalar octet  which can be constructed in accordance to the mesonic octets of pseudo - scalars and vectors  is found in a way suitable to use it in the standard meson exchange approaches as a particle with sharp mass @xmath5 .",
    "the analysis of nn scattering data within the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) framework shows however that the inclusion of scalar exchange channels is required to describe the data accurately .",
    "such an analysis is , as mentioned earlier , not possible for the s@xmath20 sector , making the scalar channels subject to modelling .",
    "one way to generate a controlled extension is to introduce the scalar mesons dynamically as correlated exchanges of pseudoscalar mesons in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channel .",
    "such an approach is used e.g. by the jlich potential @xcite .",
    "the comparison to experimental data of such a su(3 ) extended theory is needed to put it on safe grounds .",
    "`` simple '' hadronic systems containing strangeness that can be produced and observed very accurately by experiment are hypernuclei .",
    "to pin down or verify the couplings and the degrees of freedom in the su(3 ) model a microscopic translation of the free interactions to finite densities has to be performed .",
    "this can be done by the use of dirac - brueckner theory incorporating the effect of pauli - exclusion and the dressing of the free baryon propagators due to self - energies in the medium . in this approach the two particle in - medium scattering equation",
    "is solved self - consistently in ladder approximation .",
    "an application to finite systems is not possible for technical reasons . as an approximation",
    "the db self - energies can be used in the local density approximation for finite nuclei .",
    "the density dependent relativistic hadron field theory , presented in the next section , provides such a framework @xcite .",
    "the density dependent relativistic hadron field theory ( ddrh ) @xcite is a relativistic lagrangian field theory with baryons and mesons as degrees of freedom .",
    "it utilizes a mapping of db self - energies onto ddrh mean - field self - energies with density dependent couplings @xmath8 for finite nuclei with realistic interactions describing free scattering . to retain a lorentz invariant field theory the density dependent couplings are constructed as functionals of lorentz scalar combinations of the baryon field operators @xmath9 .",
    "the description of isospin nuclei within ddrh has been shown to be very good using the bonn a and the groningen nn - potentials @xcite .",
    "due to the functional structure of the vertices , containing the baryon field operators , the equations of motion for the baryons do get additional and particular terms , the rearrangement self - energies .",
    "they account for static polarization effects of the particles in the medium and are given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the meson field and @xmath12 the respective density appearing as source term in the meson field equation .",
    "these terms ensure the thermodynamical consistency of the theory .",
    "the extension to the strangeness regime would be straightforward if there were db calculations available for the complete baryon octet .",
    "an analysis of the db equations shows , however , that the coupling functionals of the hyperons can be approximated by the coupling functionals of the nucleons scaled by a constant factor and taking the respective hyperonic density as the argument @xcite : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the free couplings .",
    "we applied this prescription to the mean - field calculation of single @xmath0 hypernuclei @xcite , taking the scalar scaling factor @xmath16 from calculations of @xmath6 and @xmath7 correlations ( @xmath17 ) @xcite .",
    "the scaling factor for the @xmath18 vertex at present is fitted heuristically to hypernuclear data .",
    "the results for single @xmath0 hypernuclei are very satisfactory , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hnspec ] .",
    "the description is in quality  on the percent level  matching the result of purely phenomenological mean - field models .",
    "the additional overhead in theoretical and mathematical effort for our approach is , however , paying off in a microscopic link to the free interaction .",
    "an even more important theoretical aspect is the complete control on the dynamical content represented by specific classes of diagrams in the kernel of the db equations .    encouraged by the results , work on dirac - brueckner calculations for the complete baryonic octet based on meson exchange potentials of the bonn - jlich type is in progress .",
    "together with high precision spectroscopic measurements on single- and multi - hypernuclei , this offers the unique possibility to determine interactions for the complete baryonic octet within a consistent microscopic frame . for this approach  based on the relativistic mean - field ( ddrh theory )",
    " it will be , however , necessary , that high precision measurements are pursued on higher mass systems to obtain results as reliable as possible .",
    "the heavier systems are much better suited for structure calculations because finite size effects occuring in light nuclei are minimized @xcite .",
    "a method complementing the one presented above for achieving information on baryon - baryon interactions is the measurement of hanbury - brown - twiss ( hbt ) two particle correlations in very high energetic collisions of heavy ions .",
    "this was studied first for hyperons ( @xmath19 ) in @xcite .",
    "it was shown on the example of a s - wave resonance in the @xmath19 channel that interactions between the two particles modify quite significantly the standard correlations solely due to fermion quantum statistics , namely resulting in a negative correlation of -0.5 when the relative momentum @xmath20 approaches 0 .",
    "the hbt correlation function @xmath21 measures the ratio of the product of the two differential single particle cross sections to the differential two particle cross section , each normalized to the respective total cross section : @xmath22 first measurements for @xmath19 correlations have been performed by wa97 which , however , were of still rather poor statistics @xcite .",
    "more encouraging preliminary results were obtained in a more recent analysis by na49 @xcite , see fig .",
    "[ fig : hbt ] .",
    "the error bars , especially in the relevant region below 200 mev relative momentum , are still too large due to insufficient statistics .    within the same meson exchange model as described in the above section",
    "these correlations can be computed by solving the t - matrix equation @xmath23 and then compared to data . in the case of",
    "sufficently high statistics this will give detailed information on the interactions of the two particles .",
    "more accurate data is likely to be taken at rhic in the near future .",
    "however , there are still some `` impurities '' in the extraction of interaction informations in that way .",
    "first , the experimental spectra include secondary @xmath0s from the electro - magnetic decay of initially produced @xmath24 hyperons which thus have to be accounted for in the calculated correlations .",
    "they will somehow wash out the correlation structure of the pure @xmath19 channel @xcite .",
    "secondly , the source function of the @xmath0s ( and the @xmath24s ) needs to be modelled as this will influence the width of the momentum region in which correlations are pronounced .",

    "<S> we introduce a microscopic and relativistic theory describing free scattering and finite nuclei for the octet baryons in a consistent quantum field theoretical framework based on dirac - brueckner theory and nuclear mean - field . in a first quantitative approach - yet still heuristic for dealing with the @xmath0 hyperon - the quality of the description of finite ( hyper)nuclei based on free meson exchange potentials is competitive with those from purely phenomenological relativistic mean - field calculations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to the latter our approach has the advantage of having a microscopic link to free interactions and complete control on which classes of diagrams are included . as a complementary way for determining hyperon - hyperon and hyperon - nucleon interactions the use of hanbury - brown - twiss interferometry is discussed . </S>"
