    "this paper explores the possibility that centaur impacts may contribute significantly to ice giant luminosities .",
    "the investigation begins with an order - of - magnitude calculation of the typical centaur size required to produce neptune s luminosity with impacts alone , treating impacts as a steady - state process .",

    "the impact - generated luminosity is then @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planet mass and @xmath14 is the planet radius . equating @xmath15 with neptune s present luminosity requires @xmath16  g  yr@xmath4 . based on simulations of diffusion from the kuiper belt to the inner solar system , @xcite found that comets impact uranus and neptune slightly more than once per thousand years . to deliver the average @xmath11 quoted above ,",
    "most of the impacting centaurs with a density of @xmath17  g  @xmath18 would have to have radii over 40  km .",
    "such a large average centaur size can be ruled out by crater observations ; for example , @xcite calculated that the largest craters detected on triton were created by impactors with radii of 1 - 5.5  km .",

    "the rest of this paper examines scenarios ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .",

    "@xcite also show that centaur colors are not consistent with an origin in the scattered disk .",
    "moreover , @xcite show that the cold kuiper belt and scattered disk objects have size distributions that follow the same functional form , only with different maximum sizes .",
    "calculations presented here are based on the cold kuiper belt size spectrum of @xcite , which is a close match to the size spectrum of saturnian satellite impactors inferred from the cratering record @xcite .",
    "@xcite used a combination of theoretical coagulation models , occultation surveys , and observations of large kbos to constrain the size spectrum .",

    "@xcite also estimated the detection fraction of centaurs as a function of eccentricity , which is reproduced in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : detectability ] .",
    "the detection fraction estimate holds for centaurs with @xmath20  km . multiplying the eccentricity distribution with a fit to the detectability function ( black line in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : detectability ] ) and summing over the 0 - 1 eccentricity range yields an estimate of @xmath21% for the fraction of centaurs with @xmath20  km that have been detected .",

    "we set a lower limit of @xmath37  km to the size of centaurs considered here , which is justified because the mass contained in the smallest bodies is negligible unless @xmath38 .",
    "the @xcite conclusion that @xmath39 for the smallest bodies is supported by sky brightness measurements , which rule out @xmath40 for @xmath41  km @xcite .",
    "the size distribution computed based on the @xcite maximum centaur - size estimate contains @xmath42 comets with @xmath43  km , and is shown in the top panel of figure [ fig : sizedist ] ( red curve ) .",
    "the distribution agrees well with the results of @xcite , who predict about 100 centaurs with radii above 50  km .",
    "however , the number of small bodies is an order of magnitude lower than the @xcite estimate of @xmath44 centaurs with radii above 1  km .",
    "other estimates of the total number of centaurs come from radius measurements of centaurs and kbos .",
    "the most conservative estimates come from assuming that chariklo , the largest observed centaur , is in fact the largest centaur in the solar system .",
    "( it is highly likely that the largest centaur has not been observed , given that the detection probability is extremely low for even moderately eccentric orbits . )",
    "chariklo radius estimates range between 118  km and 151  km @xcite .",
    "the green and black curves in figure [ fig : sizedist ] show size distributions where the largest body takes on the maximum and minimum observational estimates of chariklo s radius , respectively .",
    "finally , figure [ fig : sizedist ] shows a size distribution that is optimistic about the size of the largest body , with @xmath45  km , the maximum measured radius of the plutino orcus ( blue curve ) .",
    "larger tnos such as quaoar and pluto have higher densities that suggest differentiation , whereas orcus bulk density is more consistent with the undifferentiated comet population .",
    "it is plausible , then , that orcus represents a transition object between kuiper belt comets / centaurs and true dwarf planets .",
    "note that this `` optimistic '' size distribution predicts only a factor of 2.5 more centaurs than using the @xcite results , but brings the number of small bodies closer to the predictions of @xcite .",
    "the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sizedist ] shows the cumulative mass function @xmath46 , the mass of centaurs with radii less than a given value . for each size distribution from the top of figure [ fig : sizedist ] , three possible centaur densities are considered .",
    "the highest density is the maximum inferred value for orcus ( 1.53  g  @xmath18 , @xcite , dashed lines ) .",
    "the solid lines show mass functions with the bulk density of kbo salacia , which has the lowest bulk density measurement of any tno ( 1.16  g  @xmath18 , @xcite ) .",
    "finally , the smallest centaurs may have very low densities comparable to comet 67p / churyumov - gerasimenko , @xmath47  g  @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the dash - dot lines show cumulative mass distributions with @xmath48  g  @xmath18 .",
    "all centaurs are given the same density regardless of size , though in reality the larger bodies probably have higher densities .",
    "it is important to note that the abundance of large centaurs may be out of equilibrium with the source kbo population , due both to stochastic effects and to the possibility that the diffusion rate from the kuiper belt to the inner solar system is a function of size .",
    "since impacts by 100-km objects onto ice giants occur less than once per 10  myr , these objects may be safely neglected from any discussion of the steady - state ice - giant luminosities .",
    "however , the size distributions presented here are anchored by the large objects , so disequilibrium from the source kbo population could lead to large uncertainties the number of small bodies .",
    "given the centaur size distribution , impact speed , and radiative time constants of the ice giant atmospheres , we can compute the impact - generated luminosity of ice giants as a function of time .",
    "the impact speed is @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the planet s escape speed , @xmath51 is the centaur s eccentricity , and @xmath52 is the centaur s orbital speed . for centaurs crossing the orbits of uranus and neptune , @xmath53 , and impacts occur roughly at escape speed .",
    "each impact converts centaur kinetic energy into heat , which the ice giant atmospheres radiate away over a characteristic timescale .",
    "radiative time constants @xmath54 used here are 95 years for uranus and 105 years for neptune .",
    "@xcite computed radiative time constants based on profiles of @xmath55 , the infrared energy deposited per unit volume and time at each level of the planet atmosphere .",
    "@xmath55 is usually negative , indicating cooling , and is dominated by methane emission . to compute @xmath54 ,",
    "@xcite first constructed model atmospheres by imposing the latitudnally dependent temperature measured by voyager data as a boundary condition , then perturbed the temperature profile at each atmosphere depth to compute the change in @xmath55 .",
    "changes in the composition of ice giant atmospheres , such as aerosol darkening predicted to correspond with the 11-year solar cycle @xcite , could alter the radiative time constants ; how much is not clear as the @xcite calculation has not been updated based on new data . since radiative time constants become independent of atmospheric pressure for @xmath56  bar ( the boundary between the radiative and convective layers according to @xcite and @xcite ) and even the smallest impactors considered ( @xmath57  km ) would penetrate deeper than the 1-bar level , impact - generated luminosities are assumed not to be sensitive to the penetration depth of the impactors .",
    "we use a monte carlo simulation of successive ice giant impacts from centaurs with radii chosen randomly from the size distributions plotted in figure [ fig : sizedist ] .",
    "the monte carlo simulation reveals how often centaur impacts can bring neptune s internal luminosity ( excluding reprocessed energy from the sun ) up to the observed value of @xmath58  erg  s@xmath4 .",
    "a sequence of impacts meets the criteria for a poisson process : gravitational interactions between centaurs are negligible , so the probability of an impact is independent of previous impact history , and the likelihood of an impact in a given amount of time increases with the length of the time interval under consideration .",
    "impacts are therefore modeled as a poisson process with rate parameter @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the mean time interval between impacts , and the distribution of time intervals between impacts is exponential .",
    "only impactors larger than 1  km are included in the simulation . based on their models of diffusion from the kuiper belt",
    ", @xcite calculated that there should be @xmath61 ecliptic comets ( centaurs , halley - type comets and jupiter - family comets combined , only the one based on the @xcite detectability simulation is restricted to true centaurs with @xmath62  au .",
    "however , since @xcite find that true centaurs are far more common than shorter - period comets , we also make no correction to the total number of impactors from this size distribution . ] ) , assuming a maximum radius of @xmath63  km and a minimum radius @xmath64 in the range 0.5 - 2  km .",
    "@xcite find impact rates of @xmath65  yr@xmath4 for neptune and @xmath66  yr@xmath4 for uranus .",
    "rate parameters are scaled to the @xcite results according to the number of centaurs with radii over 1  km , such that @xmath67    the simulation is built on the simplifying assumption that impact energy is deposited instantaneously and then redistributed throughout the atmosphere immediately .",
    "subsequent to an impact , newtonian cooling governs impact - generated planet luminosity as a function of time .",
    "luminosity is then determined by both the impact energy @xmath68 and the atmospheric radiative time constant : @xmath69 @xmath70 in equation [ eq : luminosity ] , @xmath71 is the time of the most recent impact and @xmath72 represents any residual luminosity left over from previous impacts .",
    "we assume 100% conversion of impactor kinetic energy to heat , though in reality some energy will be lost to sublimation and ablation of the impactor . as",
    "the goal of this experiment is to assess how much of the ice giant energy balance can be explained by impacts , no other source of internal energy ( such as gravitational contraction or radioactive decay ) is included .",
    "the simulation proceeds as follows : ( 1 ) a random set of impact time intervals is drawn from an exponential distribution .",
    "( 2 ) for each impact , a centaur radius is randomly selected from the size distribution under consideration .",
    "figure [ fig : mcsizedist ] shows two realizations of randomly chosen impactor size distributions .",
    "( 3 ) the time evolution of the planet s luminosity is calculated . at each impact time , the luminosity @xmath15 is added to any remaining luminosity from previous impacts @xmath72 and a newtonian cooling process starts ( equations [ eq : luminosity ] and [ eq : limp ] ) .",
    "( 4 ) the cumulative probability distribution of planet luminosity is calculated .",
    "figure [ fig : luminosityprob ] shows probability distributions of planet luminosity from a 10-myr simulation , for all four size distributions shown in figure [ fig : sizedist ] , and for centaur densities of 0.5  g  @xmath18 ( left ) and 1.5  g  @xmath18 ( right ) . for only the two most populous size distributions did the simulations record impacts that produce luminosities of order neptune s observed value , @xmath73  erg  s@xmath4and then extremely infrequently . if the total centaur mass is of order pluto s mass ( see blue dashed curve in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : sizedist ] ) , an impact that yields a luminosity of @xmath74  erg  s@xmath4 occurs every 0.6  myr .",
    "the largest luminosity generated by a single impact that the simulations produced was @xmath75  erg  s@xmath4 , from a 13-km impactor with @xmath76  g  @xmath18 .    based on current understanding of centaur dynamics and radii ,",
    "it is clear that impacts can not explain the ice giants energy balance .",
    "not only are energetic impacts far too rare to provide neptune s luminosity , but @xcite show that uranus and neptune experience impacts at almost the same rate .",
    "furthermore , their atmospheres radiate away energy on similar timescales . only after a rare giant impact onto one planet are their impact - induced luminosities are substantially different .",
    "instead , uranus and neptune s different energy balances are probably the result of a structural dichotomy between the two planets @xcite , though shape and rotation data are not yet precise enough to elucidate exactly how the ice giant interior structures differ",
    ".    there are two circumstances in which it may be worth revisiting the connection between impacts and ice giant energy balance .",
    "first , a re - calculation is warranted if observers discover a significant population of neptune - crossing comets that have not been well represented in dynamical simulations ( i.e. high - inclination objects ) . with a factor of 100 increase in centaur abundance over and above the most populous centaur size distribution considered here ,",
    "impacts would contribute substantially to neptune s steady - state energy balance .",
    "furthermore , high - inclination centaurs from the oort cloud have longer dynamical lifetimes than those with low inclinations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may indicate that this work underestimates the steady - state centaur abundance .",
    "the number of low - inclination centaurs sourced from the scattered disk and cold kuiper belt is not likely to increase much as both populations have been well characterized ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the highest estimate of the number of centaurs @xcite is a mere factor of four higher than the maximum number considered here , and @xcite predict only @xmath77 centaurs larger than 1  km .",
    "we do not consider a substantial upward revision to the total number of centaurs likely .",
    "second , if models of the kbo size distribution are revised to include a significantly higher proportion of @xmath78-km objects , median impact energies would produce luminosities of order neptune s current value . however , for impact rates calculated by @xcite , changing the kbo size spectrum to favor 10-km objects could push uranus luminosity well over observed values . in any case ,",
    "planetesimal - growth simulations , occultation statistics , and crater size measurements are converging in a way that make substantial revisions to the 10-km kbo abundance unlikely ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "one possibly fruitful avenue for future research is investigating the connection between impacts and seismic disturbances or storms .",
    "a comet of radius 1  km would deposit @xmath79  erg of energy locally over a timescale of @xmath80  seconds , based on the shoemaker - levy jupiter impact models of @xcite .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that impacts of energies @xmath81  ergs and higher would produce detectable temperature fluctuations exceeding 1  k on jupiter due to the excitation of seismic waves .",
    "however , impacts by 1  km objects are still too infrequent  once per hundred years , even for generous estimates of the number of centaurs such as those of @xcite  to make ice - giant seismology a reasonable observing campaign .",
    "detection of seismic activity would be serendipitous .",
    "it is faintly possible , however , that sedimentation of particles ablated from an impactor could be observable . in keck nirc2 adaptive optics observations of uranus on 12 august 2004",
    ", @xcite noted three low surface - brightness features that appeared and disappeared on timescales of 0.3 - 1.5  hours .",
    "based on observations by @xcite , @xcite suggest that sedimentation of 300-@xmath82 m particles caused by vertical motion of a cloud could produce the rapid disappearance of the faint features .",
    "while vertical shear acting on clouds is the most likely reason for small particles to descend in uranus atmosphere , we suggest cautiously considering impactors a source of settling particles . extending the @xcite size distribution down to its lowest radius limit of 0.01  km yields a total of @xmath83 centaurs , even assuming the smallest maximum centaur size considered here ( 118  km ; minimum measured chariklo radius ) . at minimum ,",
    "tens of 0.01  km - size objects would impact each ice giant per year . given that uranus has recently shown record - breaking storms @xcite , despite its equinox passage possibly decreasing convective activity , it is worth considering whether impacts may trigger local storms .",
    "funding for this project was provided by nsf grant ast-1055910 .",
    "the idea that impacts may be responsible for neptune s high luminosity grew out of a discussion in the upper - division solar system astronomy course at university of texas in fall 2011 .",

    "<S> voyager 2 observations revealed that neptune s internal luminosity is an order of magnitude higher than that of uranus . if the two planets have similar interior structures and cooling histories , neptune s luminosity can only be explained by invoking some energy source beyond gravitational contraction . </S>",
    "<S> this paper investigates whether centaur impacts could provide the energy necessary to produce neptune s luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> the major findings are ( 1 ) that impacts on both uranus and neptune are too infrequent to provide luminosities of order neptune s observed value , even for optimistic impact - rate estimates , and ( 2 ) that uranus and neptune rarely have significantly different impact - generated luminosities at any given time . </S>",
