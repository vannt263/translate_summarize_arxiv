    "one of the defining challenges for modern cosmology is understanding the physical mechanism responsible for the accelerating expansion of the universe  @xcite .",
    "the origin of the cosmic acceleration can be due to a new source of stress - energy , called `` dark energy '' , a modified theory of gravity , or some mixture of both  @xcite .",
    "careful measurement of the expansion history of the universe as a function of cosmic epoch is required to elucidate the source of the acceleration .",
    "in particular , existing data already allows direct exploration of possible time - variation of the dark energy equation of state .",
    "while several recent papers have investigated the possibility of constraining the temporal evolution of dark energy ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , here we present an analysis improving and/or complementing existing work in two ways : first , we incorporate important recent data releases , including type ia supernovae samples ( `` constitution '' and `` union '' datasets ) and baryon acoustic oscillation data ( sdss data release 7 ) .",
    "this new data provide significant improvements in the dark energy constraints .",
    "second , we utilize principal component analysis techniques to constrain the dark energy in a model independent manner , leading to more robust and unbiased constraints .    in the absence of a well - defined and theoretically motivated model for dark energy",
    ", it is generally assumed that the dark energy equation of state ( the ratio of pressure to energy density ) evolves with redshift with an arbitrary functional form .",
    "common parameterizations include a linear variation , @xmath1  @xcite , or an evolution that asymptotes to a constant @xmath2 at high redshift , @xmath3  @xcite .",
    "however , given our complete ignorance of the underlying physical processes , it is advisable to approach our analysis of dark energy with a minimum of assumptions . fixing an ad hoc two parameter form could lead to bias in our inference of the dark energy properties .",
    "in this paper we measure the evolution history of the dark energy using a flexible and almost completely model independent approach , based on a variant of the principal component analysis ( pca ) introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we determine the equation of state parameter , @xmath0 , in five uncorrelated redshift bins , following the analysis presented in  @xcite . to be conservative ,",
    "we begin by using data only from geometric probes of dark energy , namely the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb ) , type ia supernovae ( sne ) and baryon acoustic oscillation data ( bao ) .",
    "we perform a full likelihood analysis using the markov chain monte carlo approach  @xcite .",
    "we then consider constraints on @xmath0 from a larger combination of datasets , including probes of the growth of cosmological perturbations , such as large scale structure ( lss ) data .",
    "an important consideration for such an analysis is to properly take into account dark energy perturbations , and we make use of the prescription introduced in  @xcite .",
    "we also generate mock datasets for future experiments , such as the joint dark energy mission ( jdem ) and planck , to see how much they improve the constraints .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we describe our methods and the data used in our analysis ; in sec .",
    "iii we present our results , and in sec .",
    "iv we summarize and conclude .",
    "cc +   +   +",
    "the method we use to constrain the dark energy evolution is based on a modified version of the publicly available markov chain monte carlo package cosmomc @xcite , with a convergence diagnostics based on the gelman - rubin criterion  @xcite .",
    "we consider a flat cosmological model described by the following set of parameters : @xmath4 \\}~,\\ ] ] where @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) are the physical baryon and cold dark matter densities relative to the critical density , @xmath9 is the ratio of the sound horizon to the angular diameter distance at decoupling , @xmath10 is the optical depth to re - ionization , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the amplitude of the primordial spectrum and the spectral index , respectively .    as discussed above , we bin the dark energy equation of state in five redshift bins , @xmath13 , representing the value at five redshifts , @xmath14}$ ] . we have explicitly verified that the use of more than five bins does not significantly improve the dark energy constraints .",
    "we need @xmath0 to be a smooth , continuous function , since we evaluate @xmath15 in calculating the de perturbations ( and their evolution with redshift ) .",
    "we thus utilize a cubic spline interpolation to determine values of @xmath0 at redshifts in between the values @xmath16 .    for @xmath17",
    "we fix the equation of state parameter at its @xmath18 value , since we find that current data place only weak constraints on @xmath0 for @xmath17 . to summarize , our parameterization is given by : @xmath19    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ table:1 ]    when fitting to the temporal evolution of the dark energy equation of state using cosmological measurements that are sensitive to density perturbations , such as lss or weak lensing",
    ", one must take into account the presence of dark energy perturbations . to this end , we make use of a modified version of the publicly available code camb  @xcite , with perturbations calculated following the prescription introduced by  @xcite .",
    "this method implements a parameterized post - friedmann ( ppf ) prescription for the dark energy perturbations following  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dark energy equation of state parameters @xmath20 are correlated ; we follow  @xcite to determine uncorrelated estimates of the dark energy parameters .",
    "we calculate the covariance matrix @xmath21 , using cosmomc ; we then diagonalize the resulting fisher matrix @xmath22 , which can be written as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the diagonalized inverse covariance of the transformed bins . the vector of uncorrelated dark energy parameters , @xmath25 ,",
    "is then obtained from @xmath26 .",
    "if we now define @xmath27 so that @xmath28 then , as emphasized by  @xcite , there are infinitely many choices for the matrix @xmath29 ; following  @xcite , we write the weight transformation matrix as @xmath30 where the rows are summed such that the weights from each band add up to unity , and we apply this transformation matrix to obtain our uncorrelated estimates of dark energy parameters .",
    "our first analysis considers constraints from `` geometric '' data : cmb , type ia sn luminosity distances , and bao data .",
    "we subsequently include datasets that probe the growth of cosmic structures , incorporating weak lensing , as well as integrated sachs - wolfe measurements through cross - correlations between cmb and galaxy survey data .",
    "we include the latter datasets separately , since our understanding of the cosmic clustering in dark energy models still suffers from several limitations .",
    "these lss uncertainties are mainly related to our poor understanding of both the bias between galaxies and matter fluctuations ( with a possible scale dependence of the bias itself , see  @xcite ) and non - linearities at small redshifts ( see  @xcite ) . for the cmb",
    ", we use data and likelihood code from the wmap team s 5-year release  @xcite ( both temperature tt and polarization te ; we will refer to this analysis as wmap5 ) . in this respect ,",
    "our approach is more extensive than that in  @xcite and other recent studies , since we fully consider the cmb dataset instead of simply using the constraint on the @xmath31 parameter from the analysis of  @xcite .",
    "this constraint is model dependent ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) , and changes with dark energy parameterizations .",
    "supernova data come from the union data set ( union ) produced by the supernova cosmology project  @xcite ; however , to check the consistency of our results , we also used the recently released constitution dataset ( constitution )  @xcite which , with 397 type ia supernovae , is the largest sample to date .",
    "we also used the latest sdss release ( dr7 ) bao distance scale  @xcite : at @xmath32 we have @xmath33 ( where @xmath34 is the comoving sound horizon at the baryon drag epoch , @xmath35^{\\frac{1}{3}}$ ] , @xmath36 is the angular diameter distance and @xmath37 is the hubble parameter ) and the ratio of distances @xmath38 .",
    "weak lensing ( wl ) data are taken from cfhtls  @xcite and we use the weak lensing module provided in  @xcite , with some modifications to assess the likelihood in terms of the variance of the aperture mass ( eq .  5 of  @xcite ) with the full covariance matrix  @xcite . the cross - correlation between cmb and galaxy survey data is employed using the public code at  @xcite .",
    "we modify it to take into account the temporal evolution of the dark energy equation of state , since the code only considers @xmath2cdm cosmologies .",
    "we refer to  @xcite for a description of both the methodology and the datasets used .",
    "finally , we use the recent value of the hubble constant from the shoes ( supernovae and @xmath39 for the equation of state ) program , @xmath40  km  s@xmath41  mpc@xmath42  @xcite , which updates the value obtained from the hubble key project  @xcite .",
    "we also incorporate baryon density information from big bang nucleosynthesis @xmath43 ( @xmath44 )  @xcite , as well as a top - hat prior on the age of the universe , @xmath45 .",
    "in table  1 we show the mean values and marginalized @xmath46 confidence level limits for the cosmological parameters considered in this analysis for the wmap+sne(union)+bao and wmap+sne(constitution)+bao datasets .",
    "we also consider a `` global '' dataset : wmap+sne+bao+cfhtls+cmb+wl+isw+ lss .",
    "the @xmath13 entries refer to the uncorrelated values of the dark energy equation of state parameters .",
    "all values are compatible with a cosmological constant ( @xmath47 ) at the @xmath48 level .",
    "as we can see from table  1 and from figure  1 , there is no discrepancy between the union and constitution datasets ; moreover , the addition of cosmological probes of cosmic clustering noticeably reduces the uncertainty in the determination of the dark energy parameters , especially at high redshifts .    .",
    "]    to reinforce our conclusions , we also created several mock datasets for upcoming and future sn , bao , and cmb experiments .",
    "the quality of future datasets allows us to constrain the dark energy evolution beyond redshift @xmath18 .",
    "we thus consider an additional bin at @xmath49 , with a similar constraint : @xmath50 .",
    "we consider a mock catalog of 2,298 sne , with 300 sne uniformly distributed out to z = 0.1 , as expected from ground - based low redshift samples , and an additional 1998 sne binned in 32 redshift bins in the range @xmath51 , as expected from jdem or similar future surveys  @xcite .",
    "the error in the distance modulus for each sn is given by the intrinsic error , @xmath52 .",
    "in generating the sn catalog , we do not include the effect of gravitational lensing , as these are expected to be small  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we use a mock catalog of 13 bao estimates , including 2 bao estimates at z = 0.2 and z = 0.35 , with 6% and 4.7% uncertainties ( in @xmath53 ) , respectively , 4 bao constraints at @xmath54 $ ] with corresponding fiducial survey precisions ( in @xmath53 ) of @xmath55\\%$ ] ( v5n5 from  @xcite ) , and 7 bao estimates with precision @xmath56\\%$ ] from @xmath57 to @xmath58 in steps of 0.1  @xcite .",
    "we simulate planck data using a fiducial @xmath59cdm model , with the best fit parameters from wmap5 , and noise properties consistent with a combination of the planck @xmath60@xmath61@xmath62 ghz channels of the hfi  @xcite , and fitting for temperature and polarization using the full - sky likelihood function given in  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we use the same priors on the hubble parameter and on the baryon density as considered above . as can be seen from table  1 and figure  3",
    ", future data will reduce the uncertainties in @xmath63 by a factor of at least @xmath64 , with the relative uncertainty below @xmath65 in all but the last bin ( at @xmath49 ) .",
    "one of the main tasks for present and future dark energy surveys is to determine whether or not the dark energy density is evolving with time .",
    "we have performed a global analysis of the latest cosmological datasets , and have constrained the dark energy equation of state using a very flexible and almost model independent parameterization .",
    "we determine the equation of state @xmath0 in five independent redshift bins , incorporating the effects of dark energy perturbations .",
    "we find no evidence for a temporal evolution of dark energy_the data is completely consistent with a cosmological constant_. this agrees with most previous results , but significantly improves the overall constraints  @xcite .",
    "bayesian evidence models strongly suggests that the dark energy is a cosmological constant , given that the cosmological constant remains a very good fit to the data as the number of dark energy parameters increases ( see e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we show that future experiments , such as planck or jdem , will be able to reduce the uncertainty on @xmath0 to less than @xmath65 in multiple redshift bins , thereby mapping any temporal evolution of dark energy with high precision . with this data it will be possible to measure the temporal derivative of the equation of state parameters , @xmath66 , useful in discriminating between two broad classes of `` thawing '' and `` freezing '' models  @xcite .",
    "_ note _ : as we were completing this paper we became aware of the work reported in  @xcite , which considers a similar analysis of cosmological data to constrain @xmath0 . while those authors find weak evidence for evolution of the eos , we find no such evidence .",
    "the two analyses differ in the way @xmath0 is interpolated ( we use a spline , while they employ a tanh function ) , as well as different calculations of the effects of de perturbations .",
    "furthermore , we analyze different datasets ; in this paper we have utilized both the latest bao measurements  @xcite , and the latest value of the hubble constant from the shoes program  @xcite .",
