    "the method has been introduced in detail for two - body cluster bases and has been shown to work efficiently in different systems @xcite .",
    "however , there are many interesting systems that have a three - body cluster structure and therefore can not be successfully studied with a two - body cluster approach .",
    "the extension of the ncsm / rgm approach to properly describe three - body cluster states is essential for the study of nuclear systems that present such configuration .",
    "this type of systems appear , @xmath3 , in structure problems of two - nucleon halo nuclei such as @xmath1he and @xmath4li , resonant systems like @xmath5h or transfer reactions with three fragments in their final states like @xmath6h(@xmath6h,2n)@xmath2he or @xmath6he(@xmath6he,2p)@xmath2he .",
