    "<S> in this paper we report some extraordinary nonlinear dynamics measured in the resonance curve of nbn superconducting stripline microwave resonators . among the nonlinearities observed : aburpt bifurcations in the resonance response at relatively low input powers , asymmetric resonances , multiple jumps within the resonance band , resonance frequency drift , frequency hysteresis , hysteresis loops changing direction and critical coupling phenomenon . </S>",
