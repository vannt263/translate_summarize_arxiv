    "random walks ( rws ) and their scaling limits are probably the most widely known and frequently used stochastic processes in probability theory , mathematical physics , and applications .",
    "studies of a rw in a random medium are an attempt to understand which macroscopic effects can be seen and modeled by subjecting the rw s dynamics on a microscopic level to various kinds of noise , for example , allowing it to interact with a random environment or its own history ( through path restrictions , reinforcement , excitation etc . ) .",
    "the markov , or memory - less , property of simple rws lies at the heart of the classical approach to these and much more general processes .",
    "but it also imposes a restriction on the applicability of such models , as many real life processes certainly have memory . over the last decades several types of non - markovian rws appeared in the literature and became active areas of research ; for example , self - avoiding rws , edge or vertex reinforced rws , and excited rws ( erws ) , also known as `` cookie walks . ''",
    ", the name `` excited random walk '' for the model studied in the seminal paper @xcite was suggested by oded schramm .",
    "the notion of `` cookies '' in this context was introduced later in @xcite . ]",
    "the reader interested in the first two types of models is referred to the surveys @xcite and @xcite . at the time when @xcite was written",
    ", erws had just appeared and for this reason were only briefly mentioned @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of this article is two - fold .",
    "first , we give a survey of results and some of the methods concerning erws .",
    "second , we include several new theorems , see e.g.  theorems [ r2 ] , [ kal2 ] , [ 1to2 ] , and [ 2up ] .",
    "we also state several open problems .",
    "while we aim at presenting all major results known for erws on @xmath1 the choice of methods explained in some detail has been influenced by our personal preferences and contributions to this area .",
    "primarily , we shall be concerned with discrete time erws on @xmath2 , @xmath3 even though the construction can be readily extended to other graphs ( see @xcite for trees , @xcite for strips ) or continuous time - space processes ( see @xcite for so - called excited brownian motion ) . broadly speaking ,",
    "one considers a certain underlying and presumably well - understood process and modifies its dynamics for the first few visits to each site .",
    "these modifications can be thought of as stacks of _ cookies _ placed on each site of the lattice .",
    "each cookie encodes a probability distribution on @xmath2 .",
    "the walker consumes a cookie at his current location and makes a move according to the distribution prescribed by that cookie . upon reaching a site where all cookies have already been eaten or were not there to begin with ,",
    "the walker makes a move in accordance with the original underlying dynamics .",
    "below we consider processes whose underlying dynamics is the simple symmetric rw and for which the cookie stacks are random themselves ( i.i.d .  or stationary and ergodic ) and induce transitions between nearest neighbors .",
    "( for a model with cookies inducing ( long - range ) non - nearest neighbor transitions see @xcite . )",
    "we start with the description of a relatively general model which allows infinite cookie stacks .",
    "let @xmath4 be the set of unit coordinate vectors in @xmath2 and denote by @xmath5 the set of probability measures on @xmath6 , i.e.  vectors with @xmath7 non - negative entries which sum up to 1 .",
    "such vectors are called _",
    "cookies_. the set of cookie environments is denoted by @xmath8 ( here @xmath9 . )",
    "the elements of @xmath10 are written as @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the @xmath13-th cookie at @xmath14 .",
    "it is consumed by the walker upon the @xmath13-th visit to @xmath14 , if there is such a visit , and provides the walker with the transition probabilities from @xmath14 to @xmath15 in the next step .",
    "more precisely , for fixed @xmath16 and @xmath17 an erw starting at @xmath18 in the environment @xmath19 is a process @xmath20 on a suitable probability space @xmath21 which satisfies @xmath22&=&1 \\quad\\mbox{and}\\\\ p_{x,\\omega}\\left[x_{n+1}=x_n+e \\mid ( x_{i})_{0\\le i\\le n}\\right]&= & \\omega\\left(x_n , e,\\#\\{i\\in \\{0,1,\\dots , n\\ } \\mid x_i = x_n\\}\\right ) \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for all @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "here @xmath25 denotes the cardinality of the set @xmath26 .",
    "the cookie environment @xmath19 may be chosen at random itself according to a probability measure @xmath27 on @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the canonical product borel @xmath30-algebra .",
    "averaging the so - called _ quenched _ measure @xmath31 over the environment @xmath32 we obtain the _ averaged _ ( often also called _ annealed _ ) measure @xmath33:={\\mathbb{e}}[p_{x,{\\omega}}[\\cdot]]$ ] on @xmath34 .",
    "the expectation operators corresponding to @xmath35 and @xmath36 are denoted by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "a common assumption about @xmath27 will be : @xmath39 a weaker condition is : @xmath40    to escape degenerate situations we shall often assume one of the following _ ellipticity conditions _ , called weak ellipticity , ellipticity , and uniform ellipticity .",

    "if @xmath45 is such that @xmath46 does not depend on @xmath47 , and @xmath13 then necessarily @xmath48 and hence @xmath49 is , under @xmath50 , the simple symmetric rw on @xmath2 starting at @xmath18 .",
    "since the consumption of a cookie @xmath51 does not change the dynamics of the simple symmetric rw , which is our underlying process , such a cookie will be called a _ placebo cookie_.",
    "if we allow dependence of @xmath52 on @xmath53 but neither on @xmath14 nor @xmath13 we obtain all nearest neighbor random walks on @xmath2 starting at @xmath18 whose increments are i.i.d ..    if we let @xmath46 depend on @xmath53 and @xmath14 but still not on @xmath13 then we get all nearest neighbor markov chains on @xmath2 .",
    "choosing @xmath16 at random ( assuming usually ( iid ) or ( se ) ) yields all nearest neighbor _ rws in random environments _ ( rwre ) on @xmath2 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "( however , note that although rwre can be thought of as a special case of erw , the present paper does not attempt to survey rwre results . )",
    "all these processes are markovian .",
    "however , as soon as @xmath52 starts depending on @xmath13 , @xmath49 loses the markov property .",
    "the walker s behavior may depend on the number of visits to his current location .",
    "such class of processes seems to be too general to be considered in a coherent way and might not be related anymore to any well - understood underlying process .",
    "thus one has to impose further conditions on @xmath27 .",
    "one way to re - establish the connection to the underlying process , in our case to the simple symmetric rw , is to limit the number of non - placebo cookies per site .",
    "to this purpose , we denote by @xmath54 the number of cookies at site @xmath55 , if we do not count placebo cookies which are only followed by more placebo cookies .",

    "note that under assumption ( iid ) ( resp.(se ) ) @xmath57 is an i.i.d .",
    ".  stationary and ergodic ) family of random variables .",
    "again , if @xmath58 then @xmath59 is the simple symmetric rw , whereas for rwre we have @xmath60 .    in the next four short subsections we present the most",
    "commonly studied measures @xmath27 on @xmath61 .",
    "erws were introduced by benjamini and wilson in @xcite for @xmath62 , with emphasis on @xmath63 . there",
    "the walker gets a bias in the direction @xmath64 upon the first visit to a site , whereas upon subsequent visits to the same site he jumps to a uniformly chosen neighbor .",
    "more precisely , in the notation introduced above , there is a @xmath65 $ ] such that @xmath66 , where for all @xmath55 , @xmath67 in this special environment @xmath32 one can compare the erw with a simple rw @xmath68 by coupling these processes so that @xmath69 is non - decreasing in @xmath70 and @xmath71 for all @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "a natural extension of this model is obtained by fixing an arbitrary direction @xmath74 and assuming that all the cookies induce a drift in that direction . in (",
    "1.2 ) the setting is extended to measures @xmath27 which satisfy ( iid ) , ( uel ) , and for which there is an @xmath74 such that @xmath75      one way to further generalize the models described in section [ ss11 ] is to lift the restriction on the number of non - placebo cookies , still requiring each cookie to induce a non - negative drift in the same general direction .",
    "such a model was introduced in @xcite for @xmath77 and in @xcite for @xmath78 ( and for strips as a graph in between @xmath77 and @xmath79 ) .",
    "it is assumed that @xmath27 satisfies ( se ) if @xmath80 and ( iid ) and ( uel ) if @xmath63 and that for some @xmath81 @xmath82 a useful fact in this setting is that @xmath83 is a @xmath84-submartingale .",
    "cookies which satisfy the inequality in ( pos@xmath85 ) are called ( @xmath76-)_positive_. ( negativity is defined by the opposite inequality . )      this model was introduced in @xcite .",
    "assume ( iid ) , ( wel ) , and that the number of non - placebo cookies and their positions within the cookie stacks are bounded , i.e. @xmath86 this model is probably the most studied .",
    "currently , there is a rather complete picture , which includes criteria for recurrence and transience , laws of large numbers , ballisticity , functional limit theorems , and large deviations .",
    "this model can also be considered in higher dimensions , but so far there has been little progress for @xmath2 , @xmath63 .",
    "practically all work that is done on this model for @xmath80 uses a connection with branching processes with migration .",
    "this connection allows to translate main questions for this non - markovian model into questions about branching processes , which are markovian .",
    "the branching process approach was also useful in considering erw on trees ( see @xcite ) but it completely breaks down on @xmath2 , @xmath63 .",
    "one of the historically first studied non - markovian rws which fits into the above setting is the so - called _ rw perturbed at extrema _ , see e.g.  @xcite and the references therein .",
    "this is a nearest - neighbor process @xmath68 on @xmath77 which starts at 0 and satisfies @xmath87=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll } p&\\mbox{if   $ n\\ge 1 $ and $ y_n=\\max_{i\\le n}y_i$,}\\\\ q&\\mbox{if   $ n\\ge 1 $ and $ y_n=\\min_{i\\le n}y_i$,}\\\\ 1/2 & \\mbox{otherwise } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] for given @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "it has been noted in ( * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) that this walk can be viewed as an erw under the averaged measure as follows : let @xmath89 be independent random variables w.r.t.some probability measure @xmath90 such that @xmath91=p(1-p)^{k-1}$ ] for @xmath92 , @xmath91=q(1-q)^{k-1}$ ] for @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",

    "then the erw @xmath49 has under @xmath102 the same distribution as @xmath68 .",
