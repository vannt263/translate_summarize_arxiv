    "since the onset of experiments on bose - einstein condensates , vortices have attracted a lot of attention . when the bose - einstein condensate is rotated faster than some critical rotation frequency @xmath0 , a vortex appears in the gas @xcite . upon increasing the rotation frequency further",
    ", the number of vortices increases @xcite , and the vortices order themselves in a hexagonal abrikosov lattice @xcite .",
    "if the rotation frequency is increased even further , the very rapidly rotating ultracold bosonic gases have been predicted to form highly - correlated quantum states @xcite . in these states ,",
    "the bose - einstein condensate has been completely depleted by quantum fluctuations , and quantum liquids appear with excitations that can carry fractional statistics .",
    "some of these states have been identified with ( bosonic ) fractional quantum hall states @xcite , such as the laughlin state @xcite , the moore - read state @xcite and various read - rezayi states @xcite .    in this article",
    "we study the quantum fluctuations of vortices in a one - dimensional optical lattice .",
    "optical lattices provide a powerful tool in manipulating a bose - einstein condensate . by using a three - dimensional optical lattice , the bose - hubbard model @xcite was experimentally realized and the superfluid - mott insulator transition",
    "was observed @xcite .",
    "moreover , a two - dimensional optical lattice was used to create one - dimensional bose - gases and to study the crossover between a superfluid bose gas and the `` fermionized '' tonks gas @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the combination of a two - dimensional optical lattice and a single vortex was predicted to give interesting effects around the superfluid - mott insulator transition @xcite .",
    "optical lattices can also be used to provide a pinning potential for vortices @xcite , and experiments on this topic are ongoing @xcite .",
    "the physics of a single vortex line in a one - dimensional optical lattice is recently extensively studied @xcite . by putting fermions in the vortex core ,",
    "this system can even be used to create a superstring in the laboratory @xcite .",
    "a one - dimensional optical lattice divides the bose - einstein condensate into a stack of two - dimensional pancake condensates that are weakly coupled by tunneling as schematically shown in fig .",
    "[ cartoonl ] . an important consequence of this setup is that the modes of the on - site two - dimensional vortex lattice form bloch bands as a function of the axial momentum . in this paper",
    "we pay special attention to the tkachenko modes @xcite , which are the lowest - lying modes of the vortex lattice .",
    "recently , these modes have been investigated for a single two - dimensional vortex lattice both experimentally @xcite and theoretically @xcite .",
    "the number of particles in a single pancake is much smaller than in a bose - einstein condensate in a harmonic trap , and hence the fluctuations are much larger .",
    "therefore , this system is a promising candidate to reach the quantum hall regime .",
    "the requirement for that is that the ratio @xmath1 of the number of atoms @xmath2 and the number of vortices @xmath3 is smaller than a critical value @xmath4 .",
    "the ratio @xmath5 plays the role of the filling factor and estimates for the critical @xmath4 are typically around @xmath6 @xcite . however , observed filling factors are up till now always greater than 100 , where almost perfect hexagonal lattices form and no sign of melting can be seen @xcite .",
    "these experiments are carried out with bose - einstein condensates consisting of typically @xmath7 particles , whereas the maximum number of vortices observed is around @xmath8 . decreasing the number of particles results in loss of signal , whereas the number of vortices is limited by the rotation frequency that has to be smaller than the transverse trapping frequency . adding a quartic potential , which stabilizes the condensate also for rotation frequencies higher than the transverse trap frequency , has until now",
    "not improved this situation @xcite , although it has opened up the possibility of forming a giant vortex in the center of the cloud @xcite . applying a one - dimensional optical lattice produces pancake condensates each containing typically 1000 particles , such that quantum fluctuations are strongly enhanced .",
    "experimental signal is still conserved because of the combined signal of all the pancake .",
    "moreover , because of the small number of particles in each pancake shaped bose - einstein condensate , finite - size effects become very pronounced in this setup . in particular , the critical filling factor for the melting of the lattice @xmath4 changes compared to the homogeneous situation . as a further consequence",
    ", melting is not expected to occur homogeneously but starts at the outside and then gradually moves inwards as the rotation speed increases @xcite .",
    "therefore , phase coexistence is expected , where a vortex crystal is surrounded by a vortex liquid .",
    "the optical lattice gives also the exciting possibility to study the dimensional crossover between two - dimensional melting and three - dimensional melting , by varying the coupling between the pancakes .",
    "this system also exhibits an intruiging similarity to the layered structure of the high-@xmath9 superconductors @xcite .",
    "recently , the density profiles for quantum hall liquids in this geometry have been calculated @xcite .",
    "also the static properties of the lattice in a double and multilayer geometry have been investigated @xcite .",
    "finally , classical melting between shells of vortices in a single two - dimensional bose - einstein condensate has also been studied recently @xcite .",

    "[ meltvii ] .",
    "in this section we derive the effective lagrangian for the vortex fluctuations . using the ansatz that the condensates wavefunctions are part of the lowest landau level , we find the classical groundstates and expand the action up to second order in the fluctuations .",
    "we closely follow the approach in ref .",
    "@xcite for a single vortex , extending it to the case of a vortex lattice .",
    "our starting point is a cigar - shaped bose - einstein condensate trapped by the potential @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the atomic mass and @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the radial and axial trapping frequencies , respectively .",
    "since we assume a cigar - shaped trap , we have that @xmath14 and we neglect the axial trapping in the rest of this work . experimentally this",
    "can also be realized by using end - cap lasers , which results in a box - like trapping potential in axial direction @xcite .",
    "in addition , the bose - einstein condensate experiences a one - dimensional optical lattice @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lattice depth and @xmath17 is the wavelength of the laser light .",
    "the lattice potential splits the condensate into @xmath18 two - dimensional condensates with a pancake shape .",
    "each of the pancake bose - einstein condensates contains on average @xmath2 atoms , so the total number of atoms is @xmath19 .",
    "we consider a deep optical lattice , such that its depth is larger than the chemical potential of the two - dimensional condensate , but still we assume that there is full coherence across the condensate array .",
    "this means in particular that the lattice potential should not be so deep as to induce a superfluid - mott insulator transition .",
    "typically the required lattice depth to reach the superfluid - mott insulator transition in a three - dimensional lattice with one particle per lattice site is of the order of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the recoil energy of an atom after absorbing a photon from the laser beam and given by @xmath22 in a one - dimensional lattice the number of atoms in each lattice site is typically much larger than in a three - dimensional lattice and the transition into the insulating state requires a much deeper lattice @xcite .",
    "the superfluid - mott insulator transition in a one - dimensional optical lattice has recently been observed @xcite , but also in that case the number of particles per lattice site is of the order of one .    the action describing the system in the rotating frame is given by @xmath23 , where the lagrange density is given by @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the bose - einstein condensate wavefunction , and @xmath26 is the rotation frequency .",
    "moreover , @xmath27 is the angular momentum operator , and @xmath28 is the interaction strength , with @xmath29 the three - dimensional scattering length .",
    "since we assume a deep optical lattice potential , we can perform a tight - binding approximation and write @xmath30 where @xmath31 labels the lattice sites and @xmath32 is the position of the @xmath31th site .",
    "the wavefunction in the @xmath33 direction @xmath34 is chosen to be the lowest wannier function of the optical lattice .",
    "because of the deep optical lattice this wavefunction is well approximated by the ground - state wavefunction of the harmonic approximation to the lattice potential near the lattice minimum .",
    "the frequency associated with this harmonic trap is @xmath35 and the wavefunction @xmath34 is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "writing the lagrange density as @xmath38 , the time - derivative part of the langrage density becomes @xmath39 terms coupling wavefunctions on neighboring sites do not appear in this kinetic part of the lagrangian , because of the orthogonality of the wannier functions on different sites . the energy part of the lagrange density can be written as @xmath40 with @xmath41 and @xmath42 denotes that the sum is taken over nearest - neighboring sites .",

    "( [ wavefunc_z ] ) to calculate this hopping amplitude underestimates the hopping amplitude , since this approximation is only good in the vicinity of the center of the wells of the optical lattice , and not in the classically forbidden regions where the overlap between the neighboring wavefunctions is maximal .",

    "melting is only expected for a bose - einstein condensate that is weakly interacting .",
    "the transverse wavefunction can then be taken to be part of the lowest landau level @xcite .",
    "this implies that we describe the bose - eintein condensate as a compressible fluid .",

    "this involves a non - trivial jacobian , which does not change the results presented here , because we always consider the case that @xmath65 . in the calculations we take the scattering length of @xmath66rb , @xmath67 nm and @xmath68 , which gives @xmath69 .",

    ", we first have to find the classical groundstate .",
    "we calculated this groundstate for up to 37 vortices .",
    "the number of vortices in the condensate increases with the rotation frequency . for small numbers of vortices",
    ", the groundstate is distorted from the hexagonal lattice @xcite .",
    "in general , there are also vortices far outside the condensate .",
    "when there are more than 18 vortices in the condensate , there is generally one vortex in the center , while the other vortices order themselves in rings of multiples of six vortices .",
    "however , when a new ring of vortices enters the condensate , there is an instability towards an elliptic shape deformation .",
    "this is related to the elliptic shape deformation that occurs before a single vortex enters the condensate , and that has been investigated before theoretically @xcite and has also been observed @xcite .",
    "this shape instability plays an important role in the classical melting of the vortex lattice , as we show lateron .",

    "that is within the condensate as a function of the rotation frequency @xmath26 .",
    "depending on the rotation frequency , the groundstate is either a vortex lattice with a vortex in the center surrounded by rings of a multiple of six vortices such that the number of vortices can be written as @xmath71 , or a configuration where there is no vortex in the center and the vortices order themselves in rings of multiples of three vortices , such that the total number of vortices in the condensate is a multiple of three . for @xmath72 ,",
