    "@xmath9 meson candidates are identified using two kinematic variables : the energy difference @xmath42 and the beam constrained mass @xmath43 @xmath44 is the run - dependent beam energy in the @xmath19 rest frame and is determined from @xmath45 events , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the momentum and energy of the @xmath9 candidate in the @xmath19 rest frame .",

    "additional background discrimination is provided by @xmath9 flavor tagging .",
    "an event that contains a lepton ( high quality tagging ) is more likely to be a @xmath60 event so a looser @xmath61 requirement can be applied .",

    "the best fit is achieved assuming @xmath85 is a scalar state ; the mass and width determined from the fit ( see below ) are consistent with those for @xmath86  @xcite .",
    "each quasi - two - body amplitude includes a breit - wigner function , a @xmath9 decay form - factor parametrized in a single - pole approximation , a blatt - weisskopf factor  @xcite for the intermediate resonance decay , and a function that describes angular correlations between final state particles .",
    "this is multiplied by a factor of @xmath87 that describes the relative magnitude and phase of the contribution .",
    "the non - resonant amplitude is parametrized by an empirical function @xmath88 where @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 are fit parameters , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 . in the analysis performed by belle , a modified model that changing the parameterization of the @xmath94 line - shape from a breit - wigner function to a flatt parameterization@xcite and adding two more channels : @xmath95 and @xmath96 is used . for @xmath0 violation studies",
    "the amplitude for each quasi - two - body channel is modified from @xmath87 to @xmath97 , where the plus ( minus ) sign corresponds to the @xmath98 ( @xmath99 ) decay .",

    "the first evidence of direct @xmath0 violation in two - body @xmath9 decays in @xmath104 was claimed by belle  @xcite .",
    "however , this is not confirmed by the babar experiment  @xcite .",
