    "the harmonic oscillator basis has been used extensively in numerical calculations involving confined constituent quarks @xcite .",
    "the advantage of this basis is that the basis functions are easily computed and fourier - bessel transformed .",
    "this permits the computation of matrix elements in either a coordinate or momentum representation . for problems involving light quarks , where confined quarks must be treated relativistically ,",
    "matrix elements of kinetic energy operators that involve square roots , and matrix elements that involve momentum dependent wigner and/or melosh rotations are best computed in momentum space .",
    "matrix elements of confining interactions , which are simple to compute in configuration space , require the evaluation of integrals over singular distributions @xcite in momentum space .",
    "the advantage of the harmonic oscillator basis is that it is straightforward to evaluate both types of matrix elements , completely avoiding difficult calculations .",
    "although in principle it is possible perform very accurate model calculations using a harmonic oscillator basis , in practice the oscillator basis does not provide an efficient representation of meson eigenfunctions of mass operators that arise from a linear confinement plus one - gluon - exchange interaction .",
    "the reason for this is that the coulomb part of the one - gluon - exchange interaction leads to momentum - space wave functions that fall off algebraically rather than like gaussians .",
    "this algebraic falloff is also consistent with predictions of asymptotic qcd .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to suggest the use of basis functions that have all of the advantages of the oscillator basis with the additional property that they fall off algebraically in momentum space .",
    "the configuration - space basis functions , sometimes called `` sturmians , ''  @xcite , have been used successfully in atomic and chemical physics@xcite calculations . in this paper , we exploit the fact that they have analytic fourier - bessel transforms , and these transforms fall off like polynomials in momentum space .",
    "this makes them well suited for models where it is advantageous to work in both configuration and momentum space .",
    "the method is applied to low lying states of a constituent quark model of a meson .",
    "the model has a relativistic kinetic energy , a coulomb interaction , a linear confining interaction , and a smeared out spin - spin interaction .",
    "calculations of eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of this constituent quark mass operator , obtained by projecting the mass operator on the subspace of the hilbert space spanned by a finite number of these basis states , give converged eigenfunctions and good variational bounds on the mass eigenvalues . in particular , the high - momentum tail of the wave function is described quite well in a truncated basis .",
    "we also discuss briefly the extension of the method to cases where the configuration - space wave function has an integrable fractional power singularity at the origin @xcite .",
    "in configuration space the radial basis functions are given in terms of polynomials in @xmath1 times an exponential .",
    "an orthonormal basis set is then given by  @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 is the associated laguerre polynomial @xmath5 with @xmath6 and @xmath7 is defined so that the @xmath8 satisfy the orthonormality condition @xmath9    the momentum space functions are the fourier - bessel transforms of the @xmath8 s : @xmath10 they satisfy the orthonormality condition @xmath11 with these definitions both @xmath8 and @xmath12 are real .    these functions , along with spherical harmonics , can be used to expand either the momentum or coordinate representation of approximate eigenstates .",

    "the phase factor ensures that @xmath16 for real @xmath17 .",
    "we now consider the momentum - space wave function , given by the fourier - bessel transform of ( [ eq : aa ] ) : @xmath18 first , we note that the fourier - bessel transform of the unnormalized function @xmath19 is @xcite @xmath20 second , we note that multiplication of the unnormalized function @xmath21 by @xmath1 is equivalent to the operation @xmath22 on its fourier - bessel transform : @xmath23 applying @xmath24 to the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eq : al ] ) @xmath25-times gives the original function multiplied by a polynomial of degree @xmath25 in @xmath26 .",
    "in addition the coefficient of the leading power of @xmath27 is of the same sign as the coefficient of the leading power of @xmath1 in the associated laguerre polynomial .",
    "the fourier bessel transform , being unitary , preserves orthonormality .",
    "thus the fourier - bessel transform of @xmath28 has the form @xmath29 where the @xmath30 , are orthogonal polynomials in @xmath27 with weight @xmath31 . to identify eq .",

    "( [ eq : aa ] ) it is enough to choose the phase of the normalization constant so the coefficient of @xmath32 in @xmath33 has the same sign as the coefficient of @xmath34 in @xmath35 .    specifically , one can write @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is a polynomial in @xmath39 which satisfies the following orthonormality condition : @xmath40 ^ 2 k_n(u ) k_m(u ) . \\label{eq : ao}\\ ] ] the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : ao ] ) can be transformed by the following variable change  @xcite : @xmath41 to the integral @xmath42 the polynomials @xmath38 can be expressed in terms of jacobi polynomials : @xmath43 where @xmath44 this gives the following expression for @xmath45 : @xmath46^{l+2 } } p_n^{(l+{\\textstyle{3\\over2 } } , l+{\\textstyle{1\\over2 } } ) } [ { k^2 - \\lambda^2 \\over k^2 + \\lambda^2 } ]   \\label{eq : at}\\ ] ] where the normalization constant @xmath47 is @xmath48    at this point the normalization is determined up to an overall phase .",
    "the phase is fixed by requiring the sign of the leading power of @xmath1 in the associated laguerre polynomial be the same as the sign of the leading power of @xmath49 appearing in the jacobi polynomial .",
    "inspection of equations ( [ eq : ab ] ) , ( [ eq : as ] ) , and ( [ eq : at ] ) show that the phases are @xmath50 in both cases .",
    "this shows that ( [ eq : at ] ) is the fourier bessel transform of ( [ eq : aa ] ) .",
