    "there are several reasons for this : ( i ) the formula ( [ standard ] ) is simple , and fast to evaluate given ( properly deconvolved ) measured data ; ( ii ) the formula , while inexact , seems reasonably accurate for a certain limited class of impedance functions ; and ( iii ) in the absence of explicit formulas for @xmath17 , it s not clear how ( [ bad - approximation ] ) should be modified .",

    "variants of ( [ wave ] ) have been studied extensively over the last half century because they serve as a basic model in acoustic and electromagnetic imaging .",
    "much of what is known places certain restrictions on @xmath4 , such as that its logarithmic derivative @xmath49 be in @xmath50 @xcite,@xcite , which implies that @xmath4 is at least continuous .",

    "whatever the restrictions on @xmath4 , the various schemes for its determination from reflection data , including the textbook seismic approach @xcite , @xcite , involve either approximations or iterative procedures or both .",
    "apart from ( [ standard ] ) , there is no straightforward transform analogous to the radon transform of ct that directly converts the data into something representing physical structure .",

    "none of this gives a simple direct method to recover the coefficient @xmath4 in ( [ wave ] ) from time limited reflection data .",
    "the present paper details several features of the impedance transform that collectively set it apart from established results :    * it is simple , and fast to compute  fast enough to convert recorded data in real time ; * the coefficient @xmath4 may be essentially arbitrary ( see  [ sec - derivation ] below ) ; * it recovers impedance on the far side of an unknown slab exactly , without deconvolution .",

    "the rate of convergence of ( [ convergence ] ) depends on @xmath4 . in cases where the convergence is especially fast",
    "one obtains an approximation @xmath61 . extending the latter to the interior of the slab by replacing @xmath62 with @xmath63 results in the estimate @xmath64 specializing to @xmath11 , in which case @xmath65 , ( [ interior ] ) yields an alternative to the classic approximation ( [ standard ] ) , namely @xmath66 both formulas involve the accumulation function of @xmath17 , @xmath67 but remarkably",

    "a small energy lag implies high accuracy of the impedance transform of the impulse response as an approximation to the impedance .",
    "theorem  [ thm - slab ] is equivalent to the assertion that @xmath74 as @xmath75",
    ".    differentiation of ( [ accumulation - approximation ] ) yields a counterpart to the classical estimate ( [ bad - approximation ] ) , namely @xmath76 just as the impedance transform is more accurate than the standard estimate ( [ standard ] ) , the formula ( [ measurement - approximation ] ) turns out to be substantially more accurate than the single scattering approximation ( [ bad - approximation ] ) , while also being very simple .      various procedures in seismic signal processing attempt to deconvolve the source wavelet @xmath3 from the data , thereby transforming @xmath55 to @xmath17 , at least approximately .",
    "formula ( [ alternative ] ) applies to deconvolved data , as does theorem  [ thm - slab ] with @xmath11 .",
    "but in the absence of deconvolution the question of whether or not the wave form @xmath3 is zero mean becomes important . in a typical experimental context the source wave form _",

    "then @xmath91    the analogous estimate to ( [ interior ] ) in the zero mean case is @xmath92",
    "theorem  [ thm - slab ] rests on two key ideas : approximation of a given impedance function @xmath4 by step functions , and an explicit formula for the integral of the reflection green s function of a step function .",
    "more precisely , among those impedance functions which take constant values to the left and right of an interval @xmath59 $ ] for some @xmath9 , and which are bounded and bounded away from zero , we consider those that are uniform limits of step functions , i.e. , _ regulated _ functions .",
    "regulated functions are a broad class that includes , for example , all functions of bounded variation ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , regulated functions may have discontinuities  possibly infinitely many .",
    "thus , from the point of view of modelling a physical medium , @xmath4 can be essentially arbitrary .",

    "see @xcite for details .",
    "the present section compares the impedance transform to the standard approximation applied to reflection data coming from four different impedance profiles .",

    "the corresponding data and reconstructions obtained using the modified impedance transform ( with @xmath153 ) are depicted in figure  [ fig - zero ] .",
    "these reconstructions are comparable in quality and accuracy to those obtained with a gaussian source . in other words ,",
    "the modified impedance transform effectively compensates for the zero mean source wave .",
    "figures  [ fig - noisy - gaussian ] and [ fig - noisy - zero - mean ] below illustrate the effects of noisy data on the impedance transform . in the first case",
    ", 10% noise is added to undeconvolved data for which the source wave form is non zero mean . in the second case",
    ", 5% noise is added to undeconvolved data for which the source wave form has zero mean .",
    "the numerical results of the previous section illuminate two distinct applications of the impedance transform .",
    "firstly , there is the inverse problem of using reflection data to estimate the value @xmath6 of the ( eventually constant ) impedance on the far side of an arbitrary , unknown slab supported on @xmath59 $ ] .",
    "this problem is solved directly by evaluating the impedance transform on recorded data @xmath55 or @xmath86 , as appropriate .",
    "moreover , the numerical examples show that the rate of convergence at play in theorems  [ thm - slab ] and [ thm - general ] is reasonable  one does not require data much beyond the two way travel time to @xmath62 .",
    "by contrast , the standard approximation ( [ standard ] ) does not converge to the correct value at all , producing relative errors that range from 25 - 94% , even at large recording times .",
    "( note that the problem of determining reflection data on the far side of unknown structure arises not only in seismic , but also in imaging biological tissue with coherent electromagnetic reflection data such as in @xcite . )",
    "a second application of the impedance transform is to approximate @xmath2 for all @xmath154 .",
    "the numerical examples illustrate that the impedance transform ( or modified impedance transform ) gives a reasonable approximation to the full impedance profile , exhibiting its main qualitative features , albeit with overshoot and smoothing of details . in certain cases , such as for the initial part of the third profile in figure  [ fig - profiles ] , the standard approximation ( [ standard ] ) and the impedance transform give very similar results . roughly speaking ,",
    "this is the case provided @xmath155 is close to one .",
    "if , on the other hand , @xmath155 drifts outside the interval @xmath156 , say , then substantial differences emerge between the standard estimate and the impedance transform  as happens in the latter part of the third profile in figure  [ fig - profiles]with the impedance transform tracking the value of the true impedance .",
    "physical measurements of acoustic impedance of sedimentary rock taken from well bores show ratios for different rock types in excess of 4:1 ( see @xcite ) , and hence values of @xmath155 substantially greater than 3 .",
    "so in the context of seismic imaging the discrepancy between the impedance transform and the classical approximation of peterson et al .",
    "is important , with the former offering the prospect of significantly improved estimates .",
    "iterative inversion methods in seismic ( such as full - waveform inversion ) require an initial estimate of acoustic impedance , the accuracy of which is crucial to convergence .",
    "but there is no universally accepted way to obtain an initial estimate .",
    "the impedance transform provides an objective approximation to impedance directly in terms of measured data  and thus may serve a useful role in the context of iterative methods .",
    "the impedance transform is relatively insensitive to noise because it involves the accumulation function of the data .",
    "this is illustrated by comparison between figure  [ fig - noisy - gaussian ] with the earlier figure  [ fig - wave ] .",
    "ten percent noise does not seriously degrade the accuracy of the transformed data .",
    "the situation is a little more delicate in the case where the source wave form has zero mean , however .",
    "if @xmath55 includes noise , then the modified data @xmath86 is perturbed by the @xmath78-fold integral of the noise , the variance of which increases with @xmath78 .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ fig - noisy - zero - mean ] illustrates that with @xmath153 and a noise level of 5% , the impedance transform still gives reasonable results .    in summary",
    ", the impedance transform comprises a new tool with which to analyze plane wave reflection data .",
    "it substantially outperforms the standard approximation while retaining the latter s speed and simplicity .",
    "depending on the context , it may be preferable to work with pressure @xmath157 instead of particle velocity @xmath0 .",
    "the present section compiles the formulas applicable to pressure that are analogous to those derived above for particle velocity .",
    "pressure is governed by the wave equation      to avoid confusion with the previous notation let @xmath159 denote the reflection green s function for ( [ pressure - wave ] ) , and denote the associated measured data by @xmath160 the classical estimate for @xmath4 in terms of @xmath159 is @xmath161 the version of the impedance transform applicable to pressure data is the transform @xmath162 defined by the formula @xmath163 it then follows from theorem  [ thm - slab ] that @xmath164 the corresponding estimate for @xmath4 in terms of the pressure green s function is @xmath165          r.  e. boyce .",
