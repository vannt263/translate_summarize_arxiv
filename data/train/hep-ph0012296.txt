    "although the main goal of the lhc machine is the search for and the study of the physics beyond the standard model , the expected huge rates of bottom quark production make especially interesting the foreseen @xmath1 physics programme for the lhc project .",
    "in fact a specific experiment ( lhcb ) will focus on b physics , while the two general - purpose experiments atlas and cms will dedicate special periods for data taking to this aim ( see for example ref .",
    "@xcite ) . among heavy flavour physics ,",
    "heavy quarkonia production and decays have historically played a very important role in the development and test of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) as the best candidate to account for the strong interaction dynamics , and likely will continue keeping an outstanding position in this task .",
    "moreover , over the last decade hadroproduction of heavy quarkonia has received a lot of attention from both theoretical and experimental viewpoints , to explain the discrepancy between the so - called colour - singlet model ( csm ) and the experimental data , amounting to a factor of about 50 for direct @xmath2 hadroproduction at the tevatron .",
    "in particular , the colour - octet mechanism ( com ) @xcite can be viewed as the ( relativistic ) generalization of the csm and hence the most natural explanation for the unexpected surplus of heavy resonance hadroproduction .",
    "nevertheless , when applied to other production processes like photoproduction at hera , problems initially arose which cast doubts on the validity of the com , although recent progress has been done allowing for a better understanding of the situation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , results from tevatron on charmonia polarization ( one of the foremost predictions of the com ) seem to indicate even the failure of a naive application of the colour production mechanisms for charmonia @xcite .",
    "however , the com can be viewed as deriving from a low energy effective theory , the non relativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) @xcite , so the question actually arising is whether nrqcd is the correct framework to deal with quarkonia production and decay .",
    "perhaps the @xmath3 expansion does not converge well for charmonium and subleading contributions can not be neglected ; perhaps the heavy quark spin symmetry is broken to a larger extent than expected .",
    "more work in this regard is required to clarify the situation . on the other hand",
    "possibly nrqcd is appropriate to describe bottomonia states and their production because of the larger mass of the bottom quark . hence checking the com in bottomonia hadroproduction is one of the challenges of strong interaction physics over the next years .",
    "indeed there are alternative models in the literature ( based on qcd ) trying to explain the experimental facts ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "more astringent tests of heavy quarkonia production are thus required to enlight the situation , which can be qualified as rather confusing at present @xcite .    in a series of previous works ( @xcite )",
    "we have extensively analyzed charmonium hadroproduction in a monte carlo framework , using pythia 5.7 @xcite event generator with the colour - octet model implemented as a new routine in the generation code @xcite .",
    "basically , such a production mechanism is based on the formation of an intermediate coloured state during the hard partonic interaction , evolving non - perturbatively into physical heavy resonances in the final state with certain probabilities governed by nrqcd @xcite . in this work",
    "we extend our previous study of the @xmath4 resonance @xcite to the whole @xmath0 family below open bottom production , i.e. @xmath5 , using the cteq4l parton distribution function ( pdf ) .",
    "a similar analysis can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite although limited to transverse momentum ( @xmath6 ) values higher than 8 gev .",
    "although the discrepancies between the csm and experimental cross sections on bottomonia hadroproduction are smaller than those found for charmonia @xcite , still some extra contribution should be invoked to account for the surplus observed at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "however , we find that , analogously to the charmonium case @xcite , those matrix elements ( mes ) determined from tevatron data in other analyses @xcite have to be lowered once initial - state radiation of gluons is taken into account .",
    "this is because of the raise of an ( _ effective _ ) intrinsic momentum ( @xmath7 ) of the interacting partons enhancing the moderate and high-@xmath6 tail of the differential cross section for heavy quarkonia production ( for more details see ref .",
    "this effect , as generated by the appropriate pythia algorithm @xcite , is more pronounced - and likely more sound from a physical viewpoint - than a pure gaussian smearing with a ( required ) large @xmath8 value . besides pythia , in smoothing the production cross section",
    ", endows us with the possibility of extending our analysis to the small @xmath6 region of bottomonium production , keeping the assumption on the validity of the cross section factorization .",
    "the study of bottomonia production in hadron colliders should permit a stringent test of the colour - octet production mechanism , particularly regarding the predicted ( mainly transverse ) polarization of the resonance at high-@xmath6 @xcite , whereas other approaches , like the colour evaporation model , predict no net polarization ; indeed , lhc experiments will cover a wider range of transverse momentum than at the tevatron , allowing to explore the region @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the bottom quark mass .    in this paper we also present the prospects to probe the gluon density of protons via heavy quarkonia inclusive hadroproduction at high transverse momentum in the lhc .",
    "our proposal should be viewed along with other related methods of constraining the gluon distribution in hadrons like di - jet , lepton pair and prompt photon production @xcite .",
    "we must clearly state that it relies on the dominance of a particular production mechanism at high @xmath6 ( the com ) predicting a dominant contribution from gluon fragmentation . in spite of this and other assumptions ( such as the validity of the factorization of the cross section ) ,",
    "our feeling is that lhc collaborations should keep an open mind on all the possibilities offered by the machine , thereby exploring the feasibility of this proposal .",
    "for all these and other physical reasons , it is worth to estimate , as a first step , the foreseen production rate of bottomonium resonances at the lhc and this constitutes one of the goals of this work .",
    "we have based our analysis of bottomonia inclusive production on the results from run ib of the cdf collaboration @xcite at the fermilab tevatron .",
    "this means significantly more statistics than the data sample from run ia , employed in a former analysis @xcite .",
    "however , the different sources of prompt @xmath4 production were not yet separated along the full accessible @xmath6-range , in contrast to charmonium production .",
    "hence we give in section 2 the numerical values for some relevant combinations of long - distance mes , including _",
    "direct _ and _ indirect _ @xmath0 inclusive production , extracted from the fit to the cdf experimental points .",
    "( prompt resonance production includes both direct and indirect channels , the latter referring to feeddown from higher @xmath0 and @xmath11 states . ) nevertheless , we still are able to estimate some colour - octet mes for _ direct _ @xmath4 production from the measurements on different production sources at @xmath12 gev @xcite .",
    "the extrapolation to lhc is shown in section 3 where we show the predicted differential and integrated cross section for all @xmath0 resonances . in section 4",
    "we discuss heavy quarkonia inclusive hadroproduction as a probe of the gluon density in protons .",
    "finally , in the appendices at the end of the paper , we gather those technical details and values of the parameters employed in the generation .",
    "as briefly outlined in the introduction , the theoretical differential cross sections on inclusive production of bottomonia would stand above tevatron experimental points for relatively high @xmath6 if the set of long - distance parameters from @xcite were @xmath13blindly  employed in the pythia generation running with initial - state radiation on .",
    "this is the analogous conclusion which one of us ( m.a.s.l . ) reached to in the equivalent analysis performed on charmonia hadroproduction @xcite . indeed",
    "the smearing caused by multiple emission of gluons by the interacting partons is not limited to small @xmath6 values as could be initially thought , but its influence spreads over a larger region of transverse momenta .",
    "in fact we have checked , from a fit to the @xmath14 differential cross section , that actually this effect amounts to a pretty large value for the effective @xmath8 of about 2 gev , as we shall discuss more extensively in section 2.2 .",
    "therefore we performed a new analysis of bottomonia cdf data @xcite , incorporating both direct and indirect production through the csm ( as a @xmath13fixed  contribution which , in fact , is dominant at low and even moderate @xmath6 ) and the com , adjusting the long distance parameters for different cut - offs from best @xmath15 fits to the experimental points , using the cteq4l pdf . if not explicitly stated the contrary , we are turning on initial - state radiation in addition to a gaussian primordial @xmath7 distribution ( with @xmath16 gev , by default in pythia ) in all generations .      in figure 1",
    "we show the theoretical curves obtained from our fits to cdf data . in general , nice fits , with @xmath17 values not too far from unity ,",
    "were found , especially in the @xmath14 case ; instead , the @xmath18 came out to be the worst one .",
    "let us stress that in the fitting procedure we excluded any possible _ negative _ contribution from the different channels at the cross section level , in contrast to @xcite .",
    "hence we had to dismiss any contribution from the @xmath19 channels or , in other words , we set the @xmath20 long - distance parameter ( as defined in appendix a ) equal to zero , since any positive contribution from this channel would lead to a worse @xmath17 value in all cases .       in table 9",
    "we show the fractions of events inside the allowed region between the two straight lines in the plot 10.a ) ( initial - state radiation on ) .",
    "we observe that about @xmath21 of all events are @xmath13accepted  , remaining practically constant above @xmath22 gev . finally we conclude that such reduction factor ( of the order of @xmath21 ) does not represent in itself a dramatic loss of statistics regarding our proposed method to probe the gluon density in protons . on the other hand , for the gaussian smearing , the situation is even much more optimistic .      in figures 11",
    "we show the azimuthal @xmath23 angle between the muon pair direction ( defining the direction of the fragmenting gluon into bottomonium ) and the recoiling jet generated by the final - state gluon , for different values of the effective @xmath7 , in correspondence with figures 10 . in fig .",
    "11.a ) we used the pythia algorithm for initial - state radiation , whereas in figures 11.b ) and 11.c ) we used a smearing gaussian with @xmath24 gev and @xmath25 gev , respectively .",
    "as expected , again we realize the sizeable effect of the effective @xmath7 effect on the distribution , especially in the former case .",
    "nevertheless , most events should display a clear enough back - to - back signature as regards the @xmath23 variable ( in addition to the @xmath6 balance ) , as indicated by the peak at 180 degrees in all plots of figure 11 ."
