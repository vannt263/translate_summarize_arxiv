    "an important aim of lattice qcd is the understanding of the qcd phase diagram and its dependence on the temperature @xmath1 and the baryon density @xmath2 .",
    "especially the region of non - zero density is important , as it describes the behaviour of dense matter created in heavy ion collisions and plays an important role in the cosmological context . due to the well known problem of the complex fermion determinant @xcite when a non - zero chemical potential @xmath3 is introduced @xcite ,",
    "only qualitative features of the phase digram at non - zero density can be understood in terms of models and approximations .",
    "+ introducing a chemical potential @xmath3 @xcite leads to the grand canonical partition function of finite density qcd .",
    "an alternative formulation is given in terms of the canonical partition function at fixed non - zero baryon number @xcite .",
    "this is achieved by introducing an imaginary chemical potential @xcite in the grand canonical partition function and performing a fourier integration to project onto the canonical partition function for a given sector of fixed baryon number @xcite @xmath4 this formulation still suffers from a sign problem , but leads to a quite natural and useful formulation of the quenched limit of qcd at non - zero baryon number density , where the sign problem can be handled quite well @xcite .",
    "the static limit of qcd at non - zero chemical potential @xmath3 in the grand canonical approach has been formulated in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the numerical results indicate that in this case the first order deconfinement transition of the @xmath5 gauge theory turns into a crossover for arbitrarily small , non - zero values of the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "the quenched partition function in the canonical approach can be written as @xmath6 where the constraint on the baryon number is encoded in the function @xmath7 which is a function of polyakov loops , @xmath8 counts the number of quarks , i.e. @xmath9 is the baryon number . for @xmath10 and one flavour of wilson fermions",
    "@xmath11 is , for instance , given by @xmath12 ^ 3 \\nonumber\\\\ & & + v^2 ( 8 [ l_{1,0 } ] [ l_{2,0 } ] - 4 [ l_{1,0 } ] [ l_{0,1 } ] ) \\nonumber\\\\ & & + v ( 12 + \\frac{2}{3 } [ l_{3,0 } ] - 2 [ l_{1,1 } ] ) ) \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath13 = v^{-1 } \\sum_{\\vec x } ( { \\rm tr } l_{\\vec x } ) ^i ( { \\rm tr } l^2_{\\vec x})^j$ ] . +    for a more detailed description of @xmath11 see @xcite .",
    "@xmath14 is the gluonic action , which is @xmath0 symmetric .",
    "the partition function @xmath15 , is non - zero only if @xmath8 is a multiple of 3 , because @xmath11 is invariant under @xmath0 transformations only if @xmath8 is a multiple of 3 . in general",
    "it changes by a factor @xmath16 under a global @xmath0 transformation of time - like link variables .",
    "@xmath11 is still a complex function , but upon integration over the gauge fields the imaginary part of the partition function vanishes .",
    "the remaining sign problem can be handled by using the absolute value of @xmath17 and including the sign in the calculation of observables @xcite .",
    "+ our simulations are performed on @xmath18 lattices with @xmath19 and @xmath20 using the standard wilson action and one flavour of wilson fermions with quark number values of @xmath21 and 12 at fixed @xmath22 .",
    "1 shows the average sign @xmath23 as a function of the coupling @xmath24 . for large values of the temperature",
    "the sign is almost always positive , but also for the smallest temperature in our analysis the sign can be well determined .",
    "it depends on the spatial volume @xmath25 but varies little with @xmath8 .",
    "the polyakov loop expectation values in fig . 2 show a clear signal for a first order transition for the @xmath26 case , while for all @xmath27 the transition is continuous .",
    "the transition region is shifted towards smaller @xmath24-values and it broadens with increasing @xmath8 .",
    "note that by changing the gauge coupling @xmath24 we vary the lattice cut - off and through this also the baryon number density continuously .",
    "the broadening of the transition region may indicate the presence of a region of coexisting phases . the polyakov loop susceptibility ( fig .",
    "3 ) reflects the existence of a transition region that becomes broader with increasing @xmath2 , but does not show indications for a discontinuity .",
    "+ the polyakov loop expectation value becomes non - zero already in the low temperature phase .",
    "this indicates that the heavy quark potential stays finite at large distances .",
    "we validate this by calculating the potential using polyakov loop correlations ( fig .",
    "4 ) . for zero baryon number",
    "it shows the usual linearly rising behaviour for the quenched case . for @xmath21",
    "the potential stays finite at large distances due to the screening of the static quark anti - quark sources by already present static quarks .",
    "this behaviour is comparable to heavy quark potentials in full qcd @xcite .",
    "we have analyzed the quenched limit of qcd at non - zero baryon number .",
    "the sign problem in this theory can be handled quite well numerically .",
    "we find indications for a region of coexisting phases , which broadens with increasing baryon number density and is shifted towards smaller temperatures .",
    "further analyses are needed to see if this is a signal of the existence of a first order phase transition or a smooth crossover at non - zero density .",
    "we also see evidence that the heavy quark potential for non - zero baryon density stays finite for large distances already in the hadronic phase .",
    "the potential gets screened by the static quarks that induce the non - vanishing density .",
    "this will have a direct influence on heavy quark bound states at high density .",
