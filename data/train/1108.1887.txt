    "topological insulators ( tis ) are attracting great interest since they realize a new state of matter ; namely , the bulk of such materials is insulating , but in contrast to conventional band insulators , their bulk wave functions exhibit a non - trivial @xmath7 topology leading to gapless and hence conductive surface states.@xcite those topological surface states are interesting because they exhibit a dirac - like energy dispersion ( similar to that in graphene ) and a helical spin polarization , both of which hold promise for various energy - saving device applications.@xcite soon after the theoretical predictions of candidate materials,@xcite a series of promising materials were experimentally discovered to be three - dimensional ( 3d ) tis , @xcite stimulating the search for a superconducting analogue , _",
    "i.e. _ , a topological superconductor , which is characterized by a full energy gap in the bulk and the existence of gapless surface andreev bound states.@xcite such a topological superconductor is predicted to be a key to realizing a fault - tolerant topological quantum computing,@xcite and the discovery of a concrete example of the topological superconductor would have a large impact on future technology . in this context , there is an intriguing prediction that when superconductivity is achieved by doping a topological insulator , it may realize a topological superconducting state.@xcite    recently , hor _ _ et al.__@xcite reported superconductivity in the electron - doped ti material cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 for @xmath8 , where the layered ti compound bi@xmath1se@xmath2 was intercalated with cu .",
    "their samples showed superconductivity below critical temperatures @xmath9 k. in a subsequent study on these samples,@xcite it was further found that the topological surface states remain intact upon cu intercalation .",
    "thus , cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 is the first promising candidate material to be a topological superconductor , and it is very important to elucidate the nature of its superconducting state .",
    "however , the samples prepared by hor _",
    "et al . _ showed superconducting shielding fractions of only less than 20% and the resistivity never really disappeared below @xmath10.@xcite therefore , some doubts remained about the bulk nature of the superconducting phase in cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , and preparations of higher - quality samples were strongly called for .",
    "in our recent experiments,@xcite we succeeded in synthesizing cu@xmath0bi@xmath1se@xmath2 samples with shielding fractions of up to 50% ( depending on the cu concentration ) by applying a different sample preparation method than the standard melt - growth method employed in ref .  .",
    "in our high - quality samples , besides observing zero - resistivity , we were able to measure the specific - heat anomaly in the superconducting phase , which indicated that the superconductivity in this material is a bulk feature and , moreover , appears to have a full energy gap,@xcite which is a prerequisite to topological superconductivity.@xcite in this paper , we describe in detail the newly applied preparation method of cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 to employ electrochemical intercalation , and present the electronic phase diagram of @xmath10 vs cu concentration @xmath6 .",
    "we also show how the superconducting shielding fraction of the electrochemically - prepared samples changes with @xmath6 , which bears an intriguing implication of intrinsically inhomogeneous superconductivity .",
    "pristine bi@xmath1se@xmath2 has a layered crystal structure ( r@xmath11 m , space group 166 ) consisting of stacked se - bi - se - bi - se quintuple layers .",
    "the rhombohedral [ 111 ] direction is denoted as the @xmath12 axis and the ( 111 ) plane as the @xmath13 plane .",
    "the neighboring quintuple layers are only weakly van - der - waals bonded to each other .",
    "cu is known to enter bi@xmath1se@xmath2 either as an intercalant in the van - der - waals gaps or as a substitutional defect to replace bi . in the former case cu@xmath14",
    "is formed and acts as a donor , whereas in the latter case it creates two holes by replacing three bi 6@xmath15 electrons by one cu 4@xmath16 electron upon forming a @xmath17 bond",
    ". therefore cu acts as an ambipolar dopant for bi@xmath1se@xmath2.@xcite the melt - growth method employed by hor _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite can not avoid the formation of substitutional cu defects ; in contrast , our electrochemical method has a distinct advantage to promote only the intercalation of cu .    for the present experiments ,",
    "we first grew single crystals of pristine bi@xmath1se@xmath2 by melting stoichiometric amounts of high - purity elemental shots of bi ( 99.9999% ) and se ( 99.999% ) at 850@xmath18c for 96 h in sealed evacuated quartz glass tubes , followed by a slow cooling to 550@xmath18c over 72 h and annealing at that temperature for 48 h. before the electrochemical intercalation procedure , those melt - grown bi@xmath1se@xmath2 single crystals were cleaved and cut into rectangular pieces .",
    "they were wound by 50 @xmath19 m thick , bare cu wire and acted as the working electrode ( we ) .",

    "et al.__@xcite reported that cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 samples are sensitive to air , the pristine bi@xmath1se@xmath2 samples were transferred into a glove box and the electrochemical intercalation of cu was done in an inert atmosphere . to provide the electrical wiring required for electrochemical intercalation processes as sketched in fig .",
    "[ setup](a ) , our glove box was specially modified for air - tight electrical connections . for the intercalation we used a saturated solution of cui powder ( 99.99% ) in acetonitrile ch@xmath2cn .",
    "a current of 10 @xmath19a was applied to the electrodes for a suitable time period to give the desired cu concentration @xmath6 .",
    "the typical time dependence of the voltage drop between the standard and working electrodes observed for our samples is shown in fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) .",
    "its absolute value was usually between @xmath20 and @xmath21 mv .",
    "the whole process was controlled by a computer which was also used to determine the total transferred charge .",
    "after the intercalation had finished , the cu concentration @xmath6 in the sample was determined from its weight change : we measured the weight before and after the intercalation process with a high - precision balance with a resolution of 0.1 @xmath19 g , and the possible error in @xmath6 was less than @xmath220.01 .",
    "note that this direct measurement of the cu concentration is expected to be more accurate than most of the chemical analysis methods.@xcite nevertheless , we have also employed the inductively - coupled plasma atomic - emission spectroscopy ( icp - aes ) analysis , which is a destructive method but is good at giving absolute numbers , to confirm that the @xmath6 values determined from the weight change is indeed reliable , as will be described later .    for a consistency check of our electrochemical intercalation process , we have calculated the total charge transferred during the intercalation .",
    "the experimentally determined faraday number for our samples was usually up to 15% smaller than the theoretical faraday constant , 96485 c / mol . in this regard ,",
    "it was reported @xcite that a simple physical attachment of cu metal to bi@xmath1se@xmath2 crystal results in a perceptible diffusion of cu@xmath23 into the van - der - waals gaps of bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "this reaction can be described as the following oxidation and reduction formulas in an electrochemical viewpoint : @xmath24 @xmath25 the occurrence of electron transfer from cu to bi@xmath1se@xmath2 implies that the redox potential of cu@xmath26 is more negative than that of ( bi@xmath1se@xmath2)@xmath27 . since we are using a cu wire to hold the sample and to make the electrical contact , it is possible that this wire became the source of an additional cu@xmath23 intercalation to the sample(s ) .",
    "this reaction should not be included into the charge balance , and hence the difference between the estimated and the theoretical faraday number is naturally expected .",
    "this inference is supported by our observation that the sample mass increased even without applying a current , though at a much lower reaction rate .",
    "it is most likely that the electrochemical intercalation is induced by reduction of bi@xmath1se@xmath2 without reduction of cu@xmath23 , yielding ( cu@xmath14)@xmath0(bi@xmath1se@xmath2)@xmath28 .",
    "this implies that doping of electrons with the nominal fraction of @xmath6 should take place upon cu@xmath23 intercalation .",
    "the reaction at the counter electrode seems to be oxidation of cu metal rather than that of i@xmath29 to i@xmath1 or i@xmath30 , because the former redox potential is more negative than the latter one in an aqueous medium .",
    "it is important to note that the as - intercalated samples _ do not _ superconduct yet .",
    "it turned out that the samples have to be annealed in order to establish superconductivity . for this purpose",
    ", the samples were sealed under vacuum in quartz glass tubes and put into a muffle furnace . for the determination of the optimum annealing temperature ,",
    "one sample with @xmath6 = 0.31 was annealed subsequently for 2 h at different temperatures starting at @xmath31c . after each annealing run , the diamagnetic response was checked , and the result is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ setup](b ) .",
    "a trace of diamagnetism indicating the appearance of a superconducting phase was detected after annealing at 530@xmath18c , and the annealing temperature of 560@xmath18c was found to yield the largest shielding fraction .",
    "when the sample was annealed at higher temperatures than 560@xmath18c , the shielding fraction was found to be reduced irreversibly .",
    "( the onset @xmath5 was essentially independent of the annealing temperature . ) therefore , the samples used for determining the phase diagram presented here were treated in the following way : they were heated up to 540@xmath18c in 1 h , and then the temperature was gradually increased to 560@xmath18c in 40 min to avoid any overheating ; the samples were kept at 560@xmath18c for 2 h and eventually quenched by dropping the quartz glass tubes into cold water.@xcite we will come back later to the question of what is happening during the annealing process to activate the superconductivity .    to confirm the accuracy of the @xmath6 values determined by the mass change ( and also to make sure that the cu content does not change appreciably during the annealing process ) , we measured the @xmath6 values of eight of our samples in the post - annealed state by using the icp - aes analysis ( the sample mass was between 15 to 38 mg ) . for this destructive analysis ,",
    "the whole sample was dissolved in nitric acid hno@xmath2 .",

    "one can see that the local cu concentration is uniform on the @xmath19 m scale , but it is inhomogeneous on the sub - mm scale.,width=321 ]    in addition to the icp - aes analysis , we have employed the electron - probe micro - analyzer ( epma ) to check the distribution of cu within the sample after the annealing . for this analysis , one sample with @xmath6 = 0.31 was cleaved and subsequently scanned over distances of 10 @xmath19 m and 1 mm , as sketched in fig .",

    "on the other hand , the distribution of cu shows a variation of up to @xmath3220% on the sub - mm length scale [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] , although on the 10-@xmath19 m length scale the cu distribution is usually homogeneous [ fig .",

    "to take the magnetization data , a commercial squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms ) was used with the magnetic field applied parallel to the @xmath13 plane .",
    "the samples were cooled down in zero - magnetic field ( zero - field cooled , zfc ) to the lowest accessible temperature @xmath40 k ; then a small dc field of @xmath36 mt was applied and the magnetization was measured upon increasing temperature . after passing through @xmath10 , defined as the onset of the drop in the @xmath41 curves , data were again taken upon decreasing the temperature back to 1.8 k ( field cooled , fc ) . the superconducting shielding fraction of a sample was estimated from its magnetic moment at @xmath42 k after zfc .",
    "the resistivity @xmath43 and the hall coefficient @xmath44 were measured by a standard six - probe technique , where the electrical current was applied in the @xmath13 plane .    with our electrochemical intercalation technique , we have successfully synthesized samples which superconduct above 1.8 k for cu concentrations of @xmath45 .",

    "all those samples exhibit a metallic temperature dependence above @xmath10 and show zero resistance below @xmath10 , see the expanded view in the inset of fig .",
    "[ rhochiplot](a ) .",
    "with increasing cu concentration , the absolute value of @xmath43 increases ; especially , between @xmath38 and 0.40 a strong rise in the absolute value is observed , which implies that a high cu concentration enhances the disorder in the samples .",

    "the inset shows the @xmath6-dependence of the charge - carrier concentration @xmath35 determined from the low - temperature value of @xmath44 .",
    "it is striking that , despite the factor of three difference in the cu concentration , the change in @xmath35 is very small : @xmath35 = 1.5@xmath4610@xmath47 , 1.3@xmath4610@xmath47 , and 1.7@xmath4610@xmath47 @xmath48 for @xmath6 = 0.14 , 0.29 , and 0.40 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , those values correspond to only @xmath322% of electron doping .",
    "this is totally inconsistent with the expectation that there should be electron carriers with the nominal fraction of @xmath6 in cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "therefore , there must be some side reaction taking place in cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 to significantly reduce the actual electron carriers . in this regard",
    ", a similar problem was previously noted in a study of cu intercalation into bi@xmath1te@xmath2 , and it was proposed that cu@xmath23 reacts with the matrix to form a four - layer lamellar structure cu - te - bi - te that annihilates electrons.@xcite if a similar reaction occurs in cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 , it would be @xmath49[{\\rm bi}_3{\\rm se}_4 ^ - ] + h.\\ ] ] the formation of this type of structural defects can indeed explain the small @xmath35 values observed in cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ rhochiplot](c ) summarizes the temperature dependences of the shielding fraction in samples with various @xmath6 values .",
    "the onset temperatures of superconductivity in the magnetization data are slightly lower than the onset of the resistivity transition in respective samples , which is usual for disordered superconductors .",

    "[ rhochiplot](c ) shows the zfc and fc data for @xmath38 , and other samples exhibited similar differences between the two .",
    "we note that samples with @xmath50 were also prepared , but they did not show any superconducting transition above 1.8 k ; however , it is possible that they exhibit superconductivity at lower temperatures .",
    "dependence of ( a ) the critical temperature and ( b ) the shielding fraction at 1.8 k. these @xmath10 data were extracted from the onset of superconductivity in magnetization measurements , the shielding - fraction data from the zfc magnetization at @xmath42 k , see fig .",
    "[ rhochiplot](c).,width=321 ]    figure  [ tcxplot](a ) shows the phase diagram of @xmath10 vs @xmath6 based on our measurements of more than 40 samples , and fig .",
    "[ tcxplot](b ) summarizes the shielding fraction of those samples at 1.8 k. the lowest @xmath6 value at which we found superconductivity was 0.09 , where @xmath10 was already 3.45 k ; however , in spite of this relatively high @xmath10 , the superconducting signal was very weak with a shielding fraction of only around 1% . for slightly larger @xmath6 values around 0.120.15",
    "the maximum values of @xmath10 are found , but the shielding fractions were less than 20% , which is in agreement with the earlier report by hor _ _ et al.__@xcite intriguingly , @xmath10 gradually decreases with increasing @xmath6 down to @xmath51 k for @xmath6 = 0.64 , which is the highest cu concentration for which we could clearly confirm the superconductivity .",
    "although @xmath10 seems to be quite robust and reproducible , the shielding fraction exhibits a scattering among different samples even with similar @xmath6 values , as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ tcxplot](b ) . nevertheless , there is a clear trend that samples with maximal shielding fractions are obtained only for @xmath52 and the shielding fraction is reduced systematically ( almost linearly ) as @xmath6 becomes smaller than @xmath53 .",
    "this trend , together with the epma result that the actual cu concentration varies on a sub - mm scale , suggests that cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 has a tendency to phase - segregate and that there is a spontaneous formation of small islands in which the local cu concentration is essentially the optimum value for superconductivity . in view of the fact that the @xmath5 of this material is uncharacteristically high for a low - carrier - density superconductor @xcite with @xmath54 @xmath48 ,",
    "the present observation seems to imply that the inhomogeneous nature of the superconductivity may partly be responsible for the anomalously high @xmath5.@xcite furthermore , the unexpected drop of the shielding fraction for @xmath55 suggests that the inhomogeneity may be necessary for the occurrence of superconductivity in this material .",
    "if cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 indeed has a tendency toward phase segregation to spontaneously form small superconducting islands , it naturally explains why a high - temperature annealing is necessary for activating the superconductivity : it allows cu atoms to move and promotes the formation of superconducting islands .",
    "if annealed at too high a temperature , the material seems to melt partly , the crystal structure degrades and eventually the superconductivity is destroyed irreversibly . indeed , the melting temperature of cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 appears to be systematically reduced with @xmath6 , and our test sample with @xmath6 = 1.4 , which was initially rectangular shaped , became sphere - like after annealed at 560@xmath18c .",
    "( note that the melting point of pure bi@xmath1se@xmath2 is 706@xmath18c ) .",
    "therefore , the optimal annealing temperature corresponds to the one that maximally promotes the motion of cu atoms while avoiding degradation of the matrix due to partial melting .",
    "in summary , we have synthesized superconducting cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 by an electrochemical intercalation method , which yields samples with much higher superconducting shielding fractions compared to those prepared by the melt - growth technique previously employed . the superconductivity was observed for @xmath56 , which is much wider than previously reported , and the transition temperature @xmath5 was found to show an unexpected monotonic decrease with @xmath6 .",
    "also , the largest attainable shielding fraction was found to be strongly dependent on @xmath6 , and its @xmath6 dependence suggests that cu@xmath3bi@xmath1se@xmath2 has a tendency to phase - segregate and form small superconducting islands .",

    "for example , the wavelength dispersive x - ray spectroscopy ( wds ) analysis , which is a non - destructive method and is often employed in the chemical content analysis , is sensitive to relative differences , but it is not good at giving absolute numbers .    as for the optimization of the annealing time , we have annealed several samples that were already annealed at 560@xmath18c for 2 h for various additional durations of time at the same temperature ; annealing for a few additional hours did not improve the shielding fraction , and a long - term annealing ( more than a day ) usually resulted in a decrease in the shielding fraction .",
    "separately , we found that an annealing for less than 1 h did not establish superconductivity .",
    "we therefore settled on the 2-h annealing procedure to minimize the sample preparation time .",
