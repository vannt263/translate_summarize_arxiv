    "more than thirty years after its discovery , cp violation remains a mystery .",
    "our entire knowledge about it can be summarized by the single parameter @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "cp violation is not just a quaint tiny effect observed in @xmath0 decays , but is one of the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis  @xcite . within the ckm model",
    ", it is connected also to the quark - mixing and hierarchy of quark masses .",
    "a successful theory of cp violation will have far - reaching ramifications in cosmology and high energy physics .    at present , we are not able to answer even the question raised by wolfenstein more than 30 years ago : is cp violation due to a new superweak interaction , which would show up essentially only in mixing - induced phenomena ? or are there direct cp violating effects ?",
    "there exists a multitude of scenarios for cp violation , all consistent with @xmath1 .",
    "what is needed is the observation of many independent cp violating effects .",
    "this would be invaluable in directing us toward a more fundamental understanding of cp violation , in analogy to the history of parity violation .",
    "there a variety of measurements guided us to the successful @xmath8 theory  @xcite .",
    "searches for ( direct ) cp violation in @xmath9 and hyperon decays are important  @xcite .",
    "because the expected effects are either tiny for processes with sizable br s or could be large but then involve tiny br s @xmath10 , ingenious experimental techniques are being developed to overcome those handicaps .",
    "a whole class of additional independent cp measurements can be obtained from studies of @xmath11-hadron decays . although cp violation may not be ( entirely ) due to the ckm model , that model serves here as a guide .",
    "decays of @xmath11-hadrons can access large ckm phases and thus large cp violation , because the @xmath11-quark is a member of the third generation .",
    "there are many proposed methods that involve large cp violating effects  @xcite .",
    "this talk focuses on recently discussed phenomena , some of which can be studied with presently existing data samples .",
    "first , ( semi-)inclusive @xmath2 decays are expected to exhibit cp violation and ckm parameters can be extracted  @xcite .",
    "even the @xmath5 mixing - parameter @xmath7 could be determined from such flavor - nonspecific final states , in addition to the conventional methods  @xcite .",
    "second , untagged @xmath5 data samples are predicted to exhibit cp violation and permit the extraction of ckm parameters , as long as the @xmath5 width difference is significant  @xcite .",
    "the far - reaching physics potential of the @xmath12 process is touched upon .",
    "the third topic explains why the favorite method for determining the ckm angle @xmath6 , pioneered by gronau - london - wyler ( glw )  @xcite , is unfeasible .",
    "the ckm parameter can be cleanly extracted  @xcite , however , when one incorporates the striking , direct cp violating effects in @xmath13 transitions  @xcite , which were not considered by glw .",
    "traditional methods involve exclusive modes such as @xmath14 @xcite , @xmath15 @xcite , and study the rate - asymmetry between @xmath16 the effective br is tiny @xmath17 , but the asymmetries are large @xmath18 .",
    "how does this large asymmetry come about ?",
    "the unmixed @xmath19 could decay into @xmath14 directly , @xmath20 . the cp conjugated process is the direct decay , @xmath21 . to excellent accuracy , those two direct decay rates are equal .",
    "the @xmath19 could mix first into a @xmath22 and then decay to @xmath23 .",
    "the cp conjugated process is the mixing - induced @xmath24 transition .",
    "again , to excellent accuracy , the magnitudes of the two mixing - induced amplitudes are the same",
    ". the large cp violation predicted in the ckm model occurs because of the interference of the direct and mixing - induced amplitudes . to form the asymmetry , it is not sufficient to reconstruct the final state @xmath14 .",
    "one must be able to distinguish those reconstructed events as originating from an initial @xmath19 versus @xmath22 ( referred to as tagging ) .",
    "initially ( at @xmath25 ) the neutral @xmath2 meson has no time to mix . at @xmath25",
    "there is no mixing - induced amplitude and thus no cp violation .",
    "there is almost no loss in measuring the asymmetry by not considering @xmath14 events within the first @xmath19 lifetime or so . while the rate is largest during that time - interval , the asymmetry is tiny and needs large proper times to build itself up  @xcite .",
    "triggering on detached vertices is thus more efficient for such cp violation studies than one might think naively .",
    "inclusive @xmath26 samples are many orders of magnitude larger than the exclusive ones and can be accessed by vertexing .",
    "the time - dependent , totally inclusive asymmetry , @xmath27 is cp violating  @xcite .",
    "that appears to be rather puzzling , especially because the cpt theorem guarantees that the totally inclusive width is the same for particle and antiparticle . that cpt stranglehold is removed , because @xmath28 mixing provides an additional amplitude and thus novel interference effects .",
    "the totally inclusive cp asymmetry @xmath29 is related to the wrong - sign asymmetry  @xcite @xmath30 where @xmath31 denotes",
    " wrong - sign \" flavor - specific modes that come only from @xmath32 and never from @xmath33 such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 for @xmath5 decays @xmath36 for @xmath19 decays ] .",
    "the data samples for the @xmath29 asymmetries exist already .",
    "for instance , the sld collaboration determined the lifetime ratio of neutral to charged @xmath11-hadrons by an inclusive topological vertex analysis  @xcite .",
    "the polarization of @xmath37 provides a large forward - backward asymmetry of @xmath11 production and thus an effective initial flavor - tag  @xcite and it is clear that sld can study inclusive asymmetries .",
    "similarly , the lep experiments are able to study @xmath29 by using their @xmath11-enriched samples and optimal flavor - tagging algorithms .",
    "cdf has several million high @xmath38-leptons , which are highly enriched in @xmath11 content .",
    "the data sample of detached vertices on the other hemisphere allows cdf to study @xmath29 . the newly installed vertex detector at cleo permits meaningful studies , because the @xmath29 asymmetry becomes significant only after a few @xmath19 lifetimes , see eq .",
    "( [ incl ] ) below .    for @xmath39 ,",
    "the explicit time dependence is  @xcite @xmath40\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath41 .",
    "the observable @xmath42 can thus be extracted from a study of @xmath29 .    for @xmath5 mesons ,",
    "that extraction offers a significant statistical gain over the conventional method [ eq .",
    "( [ wrongsign ] ) ] .",
    "the factor of @xmath43 enhances @xmath29 over @xmath42 by an order of magnitude , which corresponds to a statistical gain of @xmath44 .",
    "there is another gain , because all @xmath5 decays are used rather than flavor - specific @xmath5 modes that must be efficiently distinguished from @xmath19 modes .",
    "the distinction involves stringent selection criteria .",
    "the reason is that the wrong - sign asymmetry [ eq .",
    "( [ wrongsign ] ) ] is time - independent , and the wrong - sign @xmath19 asymmetry is an order of magnitude larger than the @xmath5 one , within the ckm model .",
    "thus , for instance , the high - p ( -@xmath45 leptons must originate from @xmath5 decays and not from @xmath19 decays .",
    "this can be achieved by either studying wrong - sign @xmath5 modes at very short proper times  @xcite , or by inferring the existence of a @xmath46 , or by observing such primary kaons that significantly enrich the @xmath5 content , or by a combination of the above .",
    "in contrast , the unique time - dependence of @xmath29 provides automatic discrimination . for the @xmath5 meson at least",
    ", the time - dependent inclusive asymmetry may be more effective in extracting the cp violating observable @xmath42 than the conventional wrong - sign asymmetry .",
    "= 3 in    figure 1 shows what to expect for the choice @xmath47 and where new physics is allowed to enhance @xmath48 .",
    "the observation of a non - vanishing @xmath29 proves cp violation and in addition allows a determination of the @xmath49 mixing parameter @xmath7 from flavor - nonspecific final states .",
    "the traditional methods for extracting @xmath7 require flavor - specific final states and tagging  @xcite .",
    "we will mention later on additional ways to extract @xmath7 with flavor - nonspecific final states .    within the ckm model ,",
    "the totally inclusive asymmetries are tiny @xmath50 for @xmath51 and @xmath52 for @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "the ability to select specific quark transitions enhances the asymmetries by orders of magnitude , at times to the @xmath53 level  @xcite .",
    "such selections permit extractions of ckm phases and to conduct the study in either a time - integrated or time - dependent fashion .",
    "mesons , @xmath7 could be extracted from such more refined studies . ]",
    "those analyses should be pursued whenever feasible . there exist unitarity constraints , which allow systematic cross - checks .",
    "future @xmath2 detectors will be able to more fully explore the potential with such semi - inclusive data samples .",
    "one conventional way to determine the ckm angle @xmath6 is the time - dependent study of tagged @xmath54 processes  @xcite , and in the neglect of penguin amplitudes @xmath55 transitions  @xcite .",
    "it requires flavor - tagging and the ability to trace the rapid @xmath56-oscillations .",
    "the requirements are problematic :    \\(a ) flavor - tagging is at present only a few percent efficient at hadron accelerators  @xcite .- decays could be flavor - tagged  @xcite . ]",
    "\\(b ) resolution of @xmath56-oscillations is feasible for @xmath57 with present vertex technology @xcite , but lep experiments reported @xcite , @xmath58    though @xmath56-oscillations may be too rapid to be resolved at present , such large @xmath7 may imply a sizable width difference @xmath59  @xcite .",
    "non - perturbative effects may further enhance @xmath60 considerably  @xcite .",
    "perhaps @xmath59 will be the first observable @xmath61 mixing effect  @xcite , which would circumvent problems ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the @xmath56-terms cancel in the time - evolution of untagged @xmath5  @xcite , @xmath62 which is governed by the two exponentials @xmath63 and @xmath64 alone .",
    "that fact permits many non - orthodox cp violating studies and extractions of ckm parameters  @xcite :    \\(1 ) consider final states with definite cp parity , @xmath65 , such as @xmath66 if the untagged time - evolution @xmath67 is governed by both exponentials @xmath63 and @xmath64 , then cp violation has occured  @xcite .",
    "the measurement of @xmath67 allows even the extraction of ckm parameters @xcite .",
    "the physics of the @xmath68 final state is very instructive .",
    "the time - evolution of untagged @xmath68 could show cp violating effects @xcite .",
    "the @xmath69 has cp - even and cp - odd amplitudes , @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "angular correlations  @xcite allow to measure the interference terms between cp - even and cp - odd amplitudes , which for untagged data samples is proportional to  @xcite , @xmath72 the observation of such a non - vanishing term would prove cp violation and would permit the extraction of the ckm parameter @xmath73 .",
    "note that the observable depends optimally on the width difference .",
    "those interference terms once tagged allow the measurement of @xmath7 , even though @xmath68 is a flavor - nonspecific final state  @xcite .",
    "to demonstrate the point most sharply , neglect cp violation and set @xmath39",
    ". then @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the observable @xmath76 depends on @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite describes yet another method for measuring @xmath7 without flavor - specific final states .",
    "\\(2 ) after several @xmath5 lifetimes , the long - lived @xmath78 will be significantly enriched over the short - lived @xmath79 .",
    "consider then final states @xmath80 that can be fed from both @xmath5 and @xmath81 , and that are non - cp - eigenstates .",
    "cp violation is proven if the time evolution of untagged @xmath82 differs from untagged @xmath83 , @xmath84 furthermore , the ckm angle @xmath6 can be extracted from time - dependent studies of @xmath85  @xcite . from @xmath86 and @xmath87 as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite must include the effect of doubly - cabibbo suppressed @xmath88 decay - amplitudes  @xcite . ]",
    "cp violating effects and ckm extractions can be enhanced by studying @xmath89  @xcite . in summary , neither flavor - tagging nor exquisite tracing of @xmath56-oscillations are necessary , only a large @xmath59 .",
    "the favorite method ( particularly at @xmath90 factories ) for determining @xmath6 has been developed by gronau , london and wyler ( glw )  @xcite and requires the measurements of the six rates @xmath91 and @xmath92 . here",
    "@xmath93 denotes that the @xmath94 is seen in cp eigenstates with either cp - even ( @xmath95 ) or cp - odd ( @xmath96 parity .",
    "the glw method focuses on the cp violating rate difference of @xmath97 versus @xmath98  @xcite , which can reach at best the 10% level and is probably significantly smaller .    in principle",
    ", the glw method is a great idea .",
    "however , new cleo data indicate that the method is unfeasible , and that the largest cp violating effect has been overlooked  @xcite .",
    "once the effect has been incorporated , the ckm angles can be cleanly extracted  @xcite .",
    "let us review the original glw method , point out the problem , and show how it can be overcome .",
    "consider cp even @xmath93 , for which @xmath99 then @xmath100 and that amplitude triangle is shown in figure 2 .",
    "the weak phase difference of the two interfering amplitudes is @xmath6 .",
    "glw argued that the magnitudes of each of the sides of the triangle can be measured ( being proportional to the square roots of the respective rates ) , and thus claimed that the amplitude triangle can be fully reconstructed .",
    "figure 2 has not been drawn to scale .",
    "the @xmath101 amplitude is an order of magnitude smaller than the @xmath102 one , which can be seen as follows   @xcite .",
    "the ckm factors suppress the amplitude ratio by about 1/3 .",
    "the @xmath103 is color - suppressed while @xmath104 is also color - allowed , yielding another suppression factor of about 1/4 .",
    "nothing changes when the cp conjugated final states are considered , except that the ckm elements have to be complex conjugated .",
    "apparently , the cp - conjugated triangle can also be determined , see figure 2 .",
    "the @xmath105 is rotated by @xmath106 with respect to @xmath107 and apparently the angle @xmath6 can be extracted .",
    "note that the only cp violation in all these processes occurs in @xmath108 while there is no cp violation in @xmath109 @xmath110 in principle this argument is correct , but in practice the largest cp violating effects ( residing in those processes ) will be seen in @xcite @xmath111 the @xmath112 produced in the @xmath113 process is seen in its non - leptonic , cabibbo - allowed modes @xmath80 , such as @xmath114 .",

    "they require that the interfering amplitudes be comparable in size ( eq .",
    "( [ ratioampl ] ) ) , that the weak phase difference be large ( @xmath6 in our case ) , and that the relative final - state - phase difference be significant .",
    "it is an experimental fact that large final state phases occur in many @xmath120 decays @xcite .",
    "this enables us to engineer large cp violating effects by optimally weighting relevant sections of generalized dalitz plots .",
    "the traditional focus on cp eigenmodes of @xmath93 automatically excludes this so potent source of final - state interaction phases .",
    "the orthodox method  @xcite accesses only the final - state phase difference residing in @xmath121 versus @xmath113 , which is expected to be significantly more feeble  @xcite .",
    "the ckm angle @xmath6 can be cleanly extracted once one incorporates the findings of this section  @xcite , because penguin amplitudes are absent .",
    "the extraction of @xmath6 and the observation of cp violation is optimized by combining detailed ( experimental ) investigations of @xmath94 decays with @xmath122 decays to @xmath88 @xcite .",
    "this provides yet another reason for accurate measurements of @xmath94 decays .",
    "note also that observation of direct cp violation ( as advocated in this section ) would rule out superweak scenarios as the only source for cp violation .",

    "it is one of the least understood phenomena in high energy physics and a very important one . just as the successful @xmath8 theory of parity violation @xcite emerged from a synthesis of many independent parity violating measurements , so a more fundamental understanding of cp violation will profit from many independent observations of cp violation .",
