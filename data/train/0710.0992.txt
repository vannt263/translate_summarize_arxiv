    "in 1998 , @xcite , one of us ( bsk ) argued that several of the problems and puzzles concerning decoherence and thermodynamic behaviour , which are inherent in our current understanding of quantum physics in general , as well as several problems and puzzles specifically related to quantum black holes @xmath0[note : puzzles]@xmath1 ) at the end of this article .",
    "] , would appear to find natural resolutions if one makes the following hypothesis ( which is in three parts ) : first , that for the resolution of these problems and puzzles , a quantum gravitational setting is required ; more precisely , a low - energy quantum gravitational setting , where , ` low ' here refers to energies well below the planck energy .",
    "second , that low energy quantum gravity is a quantum theory of a conventional type with a given closed quantum gravitational system described by a total hilbert space @xmath2 which arises as a tensor product @xmath3 of a matter and a gravity hilbert space @xmath0[note : low]@xmath1 , and with a total time - evolution which is unitary , but that , while , as would usually be assumed in a standard quantum theory , one still assumes that there is an ever - pure time - evolving ` underlying ' state , modelled by a density operator of form @xmath4 @xmath5 , at each ` instant of time ' , one should add the new assumption that the _ physically relevant _ density operator is not this underlying density operator , but rather its partial trace , @xmath6 , over @xmath7 .",
    "third , that the physical entropy of a closed quantum gravitational system is to be identified with the von neumann entropy of @xmath6 , @xmath8 in other words , @xmath0[note : entangle]@xmath1 :    _ the physical entropy of a closed system is its matter - gravity entanglement entropy . _    with this hypothesis , an initial underlying state of a closed quantum gravitational system with a low degree of matter - gravity entanglement would be expected to become more and more entangled as time increases and thus the physical entropy , as we have defined it above , would be expected to increase monotonically , thus ( when the theory is applied to a model for the universe as a whole ) offering the possibility of an objective microscopic explanation for the second law of thermodynamics and ( when the theory is applied to a model closed system consisting of a black hole sitting in an otherwise empty universe ) offering a resolution to the information loss puzzle .",
    "it offers both of these things in that , by defining the physical entropy of @xmath9 to be the von - neumann entropy of @xmath6 , one reconciles an underlying unitary time - evolution on @xmath10 with an entropy which varies / increases in time @xmath0[note : resolutions]@xmath1 .    a second paper , @xcite ( also by bsk ) also in 1998 , investigated the implications of the hypothesis of @xcite for the decoherence of ordinary matter in the ` newtonian '  i.e. non - relativistic , weak - gravitational - field  regime . with some further assumptions ,",
    "the conclusions of this work were that , if , in ordinary non - relativistic quantum mechanics , the centre - of - mass degree of freedom of a uniform - mass - density ball of mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 would be described by a schrdinger wave function @xmath13 then the physically relevant density operator @xmath6 ( from now on , where it can cause no confusion , we will often just call this @xmath14 ) is given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the position - space density matrix one would expect to have were gravitationally - induced - decoherence effects to be ignored , and @xmath17 , which is called the _ decoherence exponent _ , is a certain function @xmath0[note : d]@xmath1 of @xmath18 and @xmath19 which depends on @xmath18 and @xmath20 only through the square of their difference @xmath21 and which vanishes when @xmath22 .",
    "explicitly , @xmath17 is given ( below and from now on , @xmath23 stands for @xmath24 and we regard @xmath17 as a function of @xmath23 ) by @xmath25 and we remark that this is a monotonically increasing function of @xmath23 @xcite .    to summarize , the overall effect of the new theory is to replace the ` would - be ' schrdinger wave function @xmath26 ( or more precisely the would - be density operator @xmath27 ) by the physical density operator @xmath14 of ( [ 1.1 ] ) .",
    "moreover , in @xcite , an asymptotic limit of @xmath17 was obtained for the case where @xmath28 , @xmath29 where ( by default we shall assume planck units where @xmath30 ) @xmath31 .",
    "we refer to ( [ 1.2 ] ) as the _ gaussian _ asymptotic regime .",
    "we remark that we expect this gaussian regime to always give a good approximation for a ball with a mass around or bigger than the planck mass , since then , whenever @xmath23 fails to be very much less than @xmath12 , @xmath32 will anyway be very small .",
    "we also remark that , as long as the ball in question is far from being on the verge of collapsing to form a black hole ( which we anyway expect it to need to be for our newtonian approximation to be valid ) then the constant @xmath33 in the gaussian regime ( [ 1.2 ] ) will ( in planck units ) be very much less than one .",
    "an asymptotic limit was also obtained in the case where @xmath34 , @xmath35 in view of which we refer to this limit as the _ logarithmic _ asymptotic regime .",
    "we shall sometimes study a model one - dimensional analogue of ( [ 1.1 ] ) which is taken to be exactly gaussian , so that the relation between the physical and would - be density operator is given by @xmath36 where @xmath37 where @xmath26 is taken to be a ` would - be ' wavefunction on the line and @xmath38 is a positive constant .",
    "we shall call this the _ one - dimensional gaussian model_.    in view of ( [ 1.2 ] ) and the subsequent remark , we would expect that , if we identify @xmath38 in ( [ gauss ] ) with @xmath39 , then , for @xmath11 around or bigger than the planck mass , this one - dimensional gaussian model will give a good approximate description of the relation between the would - be wavefunction and the physical density operator describing the centre - of - mass degree of freedom of a uniform mass bead ( i.e. a uniform mass ball with a narrow straight tube bored through its middle ) of mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 constrained to slide on a straight wire , where @xmath40 is taken to denote the position of the centre - of - mass of the bead along the wire relative to some choice of origin .",
    "we note that if such a bead is constrained to move between hard stops , say a distance @xmath41 apart  so that , calling the position of the centre of the bead when it is half - way between the stops ` the origin ' , any would - be wave function , @xmath42 for the centre - of - mass motion is required to vanish at @xmath43  then the gaussian model would , again in view of ( [ 1.2 ] ) , be expected to give a good approximation for any mass @xmath11 provided @xmath44 .",
    "@xcite also generalized the formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) to the many - body wave function ( for the centre of masses ) of a system of many balls .",
    "the general formula , for a system of @xmath45 balls takes the form @xmath46 where @xmath47 takes the form @xmath48 for some many  real - variable wave function @xmath49 and @xmath17 is a certain function which depends on @xmath50 and @xmath51 only through the distances @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) and which vanishes whenever @xmath57 for all @xmath58 .",
    "in much of this paper , we shall focus our attention on states involving a single ball in 3 dimensional space or on our even simpler one - dimensional gaussian model but we note that in the generalization to the case of @xmath45 balls of equal masses and radii , there is a generalization of the gaussian asymptotic regime in the leading term of which @xmath17 takes the explicit form @xmath0[note : ngausslog]@xmath1 @xmath59 this leads us to define an @xmath45-body generalization of the one - dimensional gaussian model by @xmath60 where again @xmath47 takes the form @xmath48 for some many - real - variable would - be wave function @xmath49 .",
    "we shall refer to this latter for one of the results obtained in the appendix ( section [ sect : app ] ) .",
    "( note @xmath0[note : ngausslog]@xmath1 also includes the generalization to the many - ball case of the logarithmic asymptotic regime . )    @xcite further proposed a schrdinger picture time - evolution rule appropriate to this newtonian approximation , according to which ( in the single - ball case ) the time - evolving physically relevant density operator is obtained by adopting the formula ( [ 1.1 ] ) at each moment in time , @xmath61 , so that @xmath62 where @xmath63 where the would - be wave function @xmath64 evolves exactly as in ordinary non - relativistic quantum mechanics , for some choice of hamiltonian , @xmath65 , so that @xmath66 @xmath0[note : timev]@xmath1 .",
    "( similarly , in the many - ball case and the gaussian model etc .",
    ", we adopt formula ( [ 1.4 ] ) , respectively ( [ gauss ] ) etc . at each moment in time , again assuming that the relevant would - be wave functions evolve in time according to some choice of hamiltonian which we again call @xmath65 . )    for a schrdinger hamiltonian of form @xmath67 , it may easily be checked that this amounts to the statement that @xmath68 evolves according to the master equation @xmath69 we remark that it is easy to see that the analogous master equation for the one - dimensional gaussian model can be written in the simple operator form @xmath70-{2\\kappa\\over m}[x,[p,\\rho]].\\ ] ]    while these master equations can be shown _ not _ to have ` gorini - kossakowski - sudarshan / lindblad ' ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) form ( we shall abbreviate this elsewhere to ` gks / l form ' ) and even not to arise from a time - indexed family ( i.e. not necessarily semigroup ) of ` completely positive maps ' acting on an initial @xmath14 ( see @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 for an explanation of all this ) they clearly do have solutions , specified by the formulae ( [ 1.5 ] ) , ( [ gauss ] ) , which consist of a density operator @xmath0[note : mdm]@xmath1 @xmath71 at each instant of time and ( in either case ) the map from @xmath71 to @xmath72 arises in the form @xmath73 where the operators ( on the space of density operators on our matter hilbert space ) @xmath74 clearly form a one - parameter group ( not just semi - group ) .      the project which gave rise to the present paper had three purposes : firstly to explore the prospects for experimentally testing the theory of @xcite , secondly to explore whether / how the theory may form a basis for a solution to some of the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics ( i.e. of the ` measurement problem ' ) , and , thirdly and lastly , to explore in more detail what the theory predicts about the time - dependence of entropy .    in the present paper , as a first step , we shall begin to explore all three of these issues , proceeding as if , for the relevant systems , the newtonian approximation of @xcite applies .",
    "it was argued in @xcite that this assumption is unjustified for physically realistic laboratory - sized systems , at least as far as questions of entropy are concerned  the problem being that , while such systems will satisfy the necessary approximations in the sense that the relevant speeds are slow enough and the relevant mass distributions very far away from black - hole collapse etc .",
    ", it is _ not _ expected ( for the reasons listed in @xcite and discussed further in section [ sect : discussion ] ) to be appropriate to treat them as _ closed_. ( they should rather be treated as open systems as indicated in note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 . )    in this article , the systems we treat will nevertheless be treated as if they _ were _ closed .",
    "thus considerable caution should be exercised in assigning a direct physical interpretation to our results . however , we shall argue in the later parts of our discussion section ( section [ sect : discussion ] ) that , as far as our first two questions ( experiments and measurement problem ) are concerned , the answers we obtain will , when properly interpreted as we explain in section [ sect : expt ] , survive when we drop this assumption and that , as far as our third question ( entropy ) is concerned , the results we obtain will at least survive as a part  albeit perhaps a small part  of the full results for actual ( presumably partly relativistic ) closed systems and also be of interest as providing ` toy models ' for these full results .",
    "proceeding then as if the relevant systems were closed and our newtonian theory of @xcite were exact , we amplify on each of these issues in turn : @xcite pointed out that , as far as the mathematical formulae are concerned , the newtonian theory of @xcite leads to large effects in the ` amount of decoherence ' already for ` small macroscopic ' systems .",
    "thus e.g. a ball with 10 times the planck mass with a would - be wavefunction for its centre - of - mass a schrdinger cat - like superposition @xmath75 ( cf .",
    "( [ cat ] ) in note @xmath0[note : d]@xmath1 ) where @xmath76 and @xmath77 are sharply localized around two distinct locations separated by a distance @xmath23 equal to one tenth of the ball s radius , will , by ( [ 1.2 ] ) , have a decoherence exponent , @xmath78 , of approximately @xmath79 , and thus have a physical density operator very close to that for a statistical mixture @xmath80 of states localized at the two locations .",
    "more precisely @xmath14 will be as in ( [ decocat ] ) with @xmath81 approximately equal to @xmath82 .",
    "it thus may seem at first sight plausible that , with suitable experimental setups , differences from the predictions of standard quantum mechanics should be experimentally detectable in the laboratory .",
    "moreover , there have been several proposals ( the proposals we mention below are @xcite , @xcite ) for such experimental setups , albeit the theories which the authors of these setups had in mind were somewhat different from the theory of @xcite , @xcite . in order to explore",
    "what the prospects are for such experimental tests , we need of course to take a view about how our mathematical formalism relates to experiment . to this end",
    ", we have explored the consequences of adopting what we shall call here the _ naive pragmatic interpretation _ according to which the usual sorts of ` observables ' , e.g. ( for the single ball model ) position ( @xmath83 ) and momentum ( @xmath84 ) and functions of these , parity ( @xmath85 ) and so on , are represented by the usual self - adjoint operators and the expectation value of the observable represented by the self - adjoint operator @xmath86 obtained in the state @xmath14 is given by the usual formula @xmath87 as we report in section [ sect : naive ] we find that , with this naive pragmatic interpretation , the expectation values of @xmath18 and @xmath84 and also of arbitrary functions of @xmath18 are unchanged , @xmath88 but that expectation values for @xmath89 and parity , @xmath85 , acquire extra terms ( see ( [ psquared ] ) and ( [ tracerhop ] ) ) . in section [",
    "sect : modunc ] , we explore the change in the naive expectation values for @xmath90 further and point out that these lead to a non - zero state - independent minimum value for the expectation value of @xmath90 and , related to this , to a modification of the usual @xmath83@xmath84 heisenberg uncertainty relation .",
    "( section [ sect : modunc ] stands to one side of the main line of the paper .",
    "the results are expected to be of interest in their own right but are not needed or referred to in subsequent sections . )    we shall however ( i.e. in spite of the alterations in naive expectation values of some observables from the those of standard quantum mechanics ) argue that our naive pragmatic interpretation is too naive .",
    "as we shall discuss in detail in section [ sect : expt ] , if one considers an experimental setup e.g. to determine the deviation of the expectation value of @xmath90 for a ball in a particular physical state from its expectation value according to standard quantum mechanics in the corresponding would - be wave function , one would presumably need to introduce at least a second ` probe ' particle and a measurement of @xmath90 for the original ball might then e.g. amount to some sort of position measurement involving the probe particle .",
    "however , as long as our probe particle is also non - relativistic @xmath0[note : photon]@xmath1 , the two - body versions of our formulae ( [ xp ] ) are assumed to apply and one can easily see from these that they entail , when formula ( [ 1.6 ] ) is applied at the two - body level , that    _ any sort of position measurement on the relevant physical density operator will always give the same result as that predicted , according to standard quantum mechanics , for the same measurement on the corresponding would - be wave function . _    in the case discussed above , the relevant physical density operator is the two - body density operator replacing the time - evolute of the tensor product of the would - be wave function for the ball and the initial would - be wave function for the probe particle . we will prove a generalization of this result for @xmath45-bodies in section [ sect : expt ] and we shall refer to this latter generalization as our _ position measurement theorem_.    one might of course think of some cleverer setup in which the measurement on the probe particle is also not a sort of position measurement , but we shall advocate the view , that for a measurement to have been convincingly made , then , sufficiently far along the heisenberg - von neumann chain of measurements ( see chapter 6 in @xcite ) it eventually ends up , or can be regarded as ending up , as a position measurement  traditionally one talks of the position of a ` pointer ' on a ` dial ' .",
    "we shall call this view the _ corrected pragmatic interpretation _ ; it is still ` pragmatic ' insofar as it still applies the formula ( [ 1.6 ] ) at _ some _ stage along the heisenberg - von neumann chain . adopting this interpretation , the general @xmath45-body argument we mentioned above applies and we thus have the rather surprising conclusion :    _ on our corrected pragmatic interpretation , the experimental predictions of the newtonian approximate theory of @xcite are identical with those of standard quantum mechanics ! _",
    "@xmath91    of course we expect that , in the fully relativistic strong - field regime , the hypothesis of @xcite will predict ( large ) differences but we expect them to depend on the post - newtonian aspects of the theory . in section [",
    "sect : expt ] ( see especially note @xmath0[note : graviton]@xmath1 ) we give an estimate which suggests that these post - newtonian corrections will , however , be completely negligible for the sort of laboratory experiments which are currently under consideration .    of particular interest in connection with our conclusion ( a ) above is the photon - interferometer - based experiment @xcite , @xcite proposed by roger penrose to detect modifications to the predictions of standard quantum mechanics predicted by theories of ` collapse - model ' type such as that of ghirardi - rimini - weber @xcite ( elsewhere in the paper , we refer to this as the ` grw ' model ) and others and , in particular , by the gravity - induced quantum state reduction proposal @xcite @xcite @xcite of penrose himself . at the heart of the experiment is a macroscopic object ( crystal ) attached to a movable interferometer mirror which , by the arrangement of the experiment would get put , according to a standard quantum - mechanics analysis , into a superposition , one branch of which remains at rest , while the other oscillates between two distinct locations . if ( e.g. because of penrose s gravity - induced quantum state reduction ) the crystal decoheres as a result of visiting ( i.e. in one of the branches of the superposition ) the distinct location during its oscillation cycle , a superposition of the photon state in the two arms of the interferometer will ( by the design of the experiment  see section [ sect : penrose ] ) get converted into a partly decohered mixture thereby changing the predicted exit - paths of a certain fraction of the photons travelling through the interferometer from what would be predicted by standard quantum mechanics , and this change can then be detected with suitable photon detectors .    according to kay s theory @xcite such a crystal will ( if the size is sufficient and the distinct location suitably distant ) in some ways similarly to what is predicted by penrose s quantum state reduction , be predicted to decohere each time it visits its distinct location and yet , according to our conclusion ( a ) ( and assuming that it applies when some of the particles involved are photons @xmath0[note : photon]@xmath1 ) what is detected at the detector must be identical to what would be predicted by standard quantum mechanics .",
    "in subsection [ sect : penrose ] we explain how this difference in predictions between the theory of kay and the quantum state reduction of penrose may be traced to the following qualitative difference between their proposed decoherence mechanisms . on the penrose proposal",
    "it is ( at least implicitly ) assumed that once the crystal has decohered , then it can not later recohere . in the kay theory of @xcite ,",
    "on the other hand , the superposition involving the crystal is understood to decohere when , in one of the branches of its superposition , the crystal is in its distinct location , but to recohere each time the crystal returns to being in the same location in both branches .",
    "turning to the second of our purposes , which , we recall , was to explore how the theory of @xcite may form a basis for a solution to some of the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics , we begin by remarking that while the _ corrected pragmatic interpretation _ described above seems the best we can do at the moment to interpret our theory and make experimental predictions , it is still unsatisfactory in that , like the standard interpretation of standard quantum mechanics , it makes essential reference to ` observables ' and hence implicitly to ` observers ' and , as e.g. john bell eloquently argued ( see e.g. @xcite ) one might hope that our current understanding of quantum mechanics will one day be superceded by a theory which is more objective in nature .",
    "indeed many authors have asked for a modification of quantum mechanics ( or maybe for a changed interpretation of standard quantum mechanics ) in which there is an objective notion of ` events ' which ` happen ' . for theories which are couched in terms of a time - evolving density operator @xmath92 , as in either the full hypothesis of @xcite or the newtonian approximate theory of @xcite being considered here ( but also ` collapse models ' which we mentioned above in connection with the penrose experiment ) ) a natural proposal would seem to be @xmath0[note : asfarasaware]@xmath1 @xmath0[note : unravel]@xmath1 @xmath0[note : objprob]@xmath1 :    _ the set of possible events which can happen at a given time , @xmath61 , is to be identified with the set of spectral subspaces of @xmath92 at that time . the probability with which a given such event occurs is to be identified with @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the eigenvalue of @xmath92 belonging to that subspace and @xmath95 is its multiplicity ( i.e. the dimension of the subspace ) .",
    "_ @xmath96    as we will discuss further in section [ sect : events ] , this proposed interpretation would , for example , interpret the state ( [ decocatintro ] ) in terms of two possible events , namely the subspace spanned by @xmath76 and the subspace spanned by @xmath77 , and assign to these events the probabilities @xmath97 , @xmath98 respectively .",
    "we shall also explore , in section [ sect : events ] , what this proposed interpretation entails for the gaussian model ( [ gauss ] ) and shall actually simplify this further by studying that only to first order in @xmath38 .    in order to do this ,",
    "we obtain , in the appendix , the diagonalization of the density operator of the one - dimensional gaussian model to first order in @xmath38 .",
    "a typical result is that , for a given would - be wave function @xmath26 which is an even function or an odd function , the density operator @xmath14 in ( [ gauss ] ) takes , to first order in @xmath38 , the form @xmath99 where @xmath100 is ( for small @xmath38 ) close to 1 and @xmath101 ( see ( [ gaussevents ] ) ) resembles @xmath26 while @xmath102 is small and @xmath103 ( equal to a normalization constant times @xmath104 ) has the opposite parity to @xmath26 . according to our proposal ,",
    "this would be interpreted to mean that , for such an ( even or odd ) would - be symmetric quantum wavefunction on the real line , there are two events , one with probability @xmath105 which is identified with the subspace spanned by @xmath101 and one with probability @xmath106 which is identified with the subspace spanned by @xmath103 .    concerning our third purpose , which is to explore what the theory of @xcite has to say about the time - evolution of entropy",
    ", we make a small beginning in section [ sect : entropy ] by exploring how the von - neumann entropy @xmath107 and also the entropy - like quantity @xmath108 vary in time , mainly treating our one - dimensional gaussian model restricted further to would - be wave functions which are either even or odd and to the regime where working to first order in @xmath38 suffices so that we may utilize the diagonalization results obtained in the appendix .",
    "as is apparent from the formulae quoted above for the eigenvalues @xmath105 and @xmath106 , the values of @xmath107 and @xmath109 for this model when the system is in a given would - be state , @xmath26 , at a given time @xmath61 , will be correlated with the value of the standard - quantum - mechanical quantity @xmath110 at that time , which , in standard quantum mechanics , is of course a measure of the ` spreading of the ( would - be ) wave - packet ' .",
    "this leads , if , as is the case for a free hamiltonian , the hamiltonian governing the would - be dynamics leads to spreading of the wave packet at times on either side of a time of minimum spread , to a ` two - sided entropy increase ' result . on the other hand , for a would - be hamiltonian , say , of harmonic - oscillator type , the would - be wavefunction will be periodic in time , and therefore the amount of wavepacket - spreading and therefore also the values of @xmath107 and @xmath109 will be periodic in time , indicating a continual process of decoherence and recoherence .",
    "we point out that this is analogous to the decoherence - followed - by - recoherence mentioned above in our discussion of the penrose experiment .",
    "we also compare and contrast this hamiltonian - dependent behaviour of @xmath107 and @xmath109 with the typical sort of monotonic entropy - increase result that one finds for density operators which satisfy master equations of gks / l form which are usually the relevant master equations in collapse models .",
    "specifically , we compare and contrast the results mentioned above which are relevant to the master equation ( [ gaussmaster ] ) with an easily - derived result on the hamiltonian - independent monotonic increase of entropy for the barchielli - lanz - prosperi @xcite master equation ( [ blp ] ) @xmath111-c[x , [ x , \\rho]]\\ ] ] ( @xmath112 a positive constant ) which may be regarded as a prototype master equation of gks / l form .",
    "( elsewhere in this paper , we shall refer to this as the ` blp ' equation . )",
    "the main part of the paper ends , in section [ sect : discussion ] , with a discussion of various issues arising from the earlier sections .",
    "we shall summarize here some of the main overall conclusions which we draw , in section [ sect : discussion ] by comparing and contrasting what we have learned about the theory of @xcite with the properties of ` collapse models ' such as grw @xcite .",
    "first , we conclude that , for ordinary laboratory - sized quantum systems , the cautionary remarks mentioned at the start of this subsection can be ignored as far as quantum mechanical measurements are concerned and ( in view of our position measurement theorem and our ` corrected pragmatic interpretation ' ) our theory really does have identical experimental predictions to standard quantum mechanics ( although there will be deviations when relativistic effects are taken into account ) while , at the same time , being free from macroscopic schrdinger cat - like superpositions .",
    "this is to be compared and contrasted with collapse models which predict small deviations from the predictions of standard ( non - relativistic ) quantum mechanics while also being free from schrdinger cat - like superpositions .",
    "another feature of collapse models is that they give rise to an increasing amount of decoherence as time increases .",
    "for our theory , we give , in section [ sect : discussion ] , plausibility arguments for a two - sided entropy - increase result , of the sort discussed in section [ sect : entropy ] and mentioned above , for a wide variety of ` generic ' model closed systems within the newtonian framework of @xcite and we also argue for a plausible post - newtonian extension of such results . concerning the two - sidedness , we advocate , in section [ sect : discussion ] , the natural physical interpretation that the negative - times should be discarded as physically irrelevant and the time - zero density operator regarded as the ` initial state ' .",
    "( if the closed system is taken as modelling the universe , then this will model the initial physically relevant density operator of the universe . ) in this sense , such results would amount to proofs , for appropriate models , of the second law .",
    "as far as decoherence is concerned , such second - law results can be interpreted as entailing an increasing amount of decoherence as time increases .",
    "however , we do not interpret these results as applying to actual ordinary ( non - relativistic ) systems of laboratory size because indeed we will argue in section [ sect : discussion ] that , as far as questions of entropy are concerned , actual closed systems must be partly relativistic and indeed may well be of galaxy - size !",
    "rather , we argue that actual small ordinary laboratory - sized systems need to be regarded as _ open _ systems ( see note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 ) and that the correct mechanism behind their decoherence is essentially the same as that advocated on the traditional environment - induced decoherence paradigm .",
    "( the entropy , i.e. amount of decoherence , will then increase or decrease with time according to the model and state etc . )",
    "( we have omitted here a comparison of approaches to ` events ' in the two theories . for this",
    ", we refer to sections [ sect : events ] and [ sect : discussion ] and especially note @xmath0[note : unravel]@xmath1 . )    our overall conclusion from this comparison is that our approximate newtonian theory of @xcite does a similar job to the job which ` collapse models ' such as grw @xcite do  albeit in a slightly different and partly unexpected and surprising way but with the advantage that , while collapse models are ad hoc , our newtonian approximate theory is part and parcel of a general hypothesis ( i.e. the hypothesis of @xcite ) which also resolves a number of other puzzles .",
    "this paper arose out of an ongoing research project of one of the authors ( bsk ) . while both authors were involved with the new results presented in the paper , the main involvement of va was with sections [ sect : naive ] , [ sect : modunc ] , and [ sect : app ] with section [ sect : modunc ] and subsections [ sect : manydiag ] and [ sect:3d ] being mainly due to va . some further material related to these sections",
    "can be found in @xcite .",
    "some parts of the rest of the paper ( including the last paragraph of subsection [ sect : purpose ] , the proposed interpretation in terms of events in sections [ sect : intro ] and [ sect : events ] and the _ position measurement theorem _ discussed in sections [ sect : intro ] and [ sect : expt ] , including the discussion of the penrose experiment in subsection [ sect : penrose ] ) ) are mainly due to bsk , as are sections [ sect : entropy ] and [ sect : discussion ] .",

    "the equation @xmath138 predicts e.g. an identical diffraction pattern to that of standard quantum mechanics e.g. for a double - slit experiment involving a ball of ordinary matter even as heavy as or heavier than the planck mass ( cf . the experiments of zeilinger et al @xcite albeit for smaller masses ) . on the other hand , if we consider the wavefunction for , say , the ground state of such a ball in a spherical or cubical box etc .",

    "note also that , throughout this section , we shall not assume that a repeated index is summed over . )    continuing to adopt the naive pragmatic interpretation , it is interesting to note that eq .",
    "( [ compsquared ] ) implies that there is a minimum value ( i.e. @xmath152 ) for the expectation value @xmath153 of the square of each component of the momentum in a given physical state for the centre of mass motion of one of our balls of mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 .",
    "given that @xmath154 , and defining the squared uncertainty , @xmath155 , in @xmath156 in the usual way by @xmath157 we have @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the usual uncertainty in @xmath156 of the corresponding would - be wave function .",
    "so the squared uncertainty in each component of momentum also has a minimum possible value of @xmath160 .",
    "to get some idea of the orders of magnitude involved , we can convert the minimum expectation value , @xmath161 , of @xmath90 into a ` maximum wavelength ' ( cf . the de broglie relation ` @xmath162 ' ) , so that @xmath163 in any system of units , this is @xmath164 .",
    "thus , for the centre - of - mass motion of a uniform density ball of mass around the planck mass ( i.e. around @xmath165 g ) @xmath94 will be of the same order of magnitude as the ball s radius . for a proton , modelled as a uniform density ball with the proton mass and a radius around @xmath166 cm",
    ", @xmath94 will be of the order of 10 kilometres !    in view of @xmath138 ( and with obvious definitions ) the squared uncertainty @xmath167 in a given physical state for a given component of position will equal the usual squared uncertainty @xmath168 in the corresponding would - be wave function .",
    "combining this with ( [ uncertainty ] ) leads to the replacement of the usual heisenberg uncertainty relation @xmath169 by @xmath170    we remark that if we were to take this relation to be fundamental then we could recover the lower bound @xmath171 from it .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , in the past few years , and partly motivated by string theory , many authors have proposed modified uncertainty relations along the schematic lines @xmath172 where @xmath112 is a constant . sometimes these are thought of as applying to spacetime coordinates but sometimes to the coordinates of a non - relativistic particle , see e.g. @xcite . in the latter case , these resemble ( [ modheis ] )  and even more closely , in the case @xmath173 , its approximation to first order in @xmath33 : @xmath174 _ except that _ the roles of @xmath175 and @xmath176 are interchanged , so that , e.g. in @xcite and other related references , one deduces a lower bound on @xmath177 rather than on @xmath178 .",
    "in this section , we elucidate further and prove , the _ position measurement theorem _ which was outlined in the introduction , according to which any sort of position measurement in the newtonian approximate theory of @xcite based on the hypothesis of @xcite will , under the naive pragmatic interpretation , have an outcome indistinguishable from that predicted by standard quantum mechanics .",
    "we also amplify on what was said in the introduction about the _ corrected pragmatic interpretation _ and on the conclusion that , with this interpretation , the newtonian approximation of @xcite is experimentally indistinguishable from standard quantum mechanics .",
    "we also discuss in detail in subsection [ sect : penrose ] how this works out for the class of experiments recently proposed by roger penrose which we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "consider first our example ( introduced in section [ sect : intro ] where we pointed out that it is approximately described",
    " when @xmath44  by the one - dimensional gaussian model , also introduced there ) involving a uniform mass - density bead of mass @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 free to slide on a straight wire which terminates at stops a distance @xmath41 apart .",
    "calling the direction of the wire ` the @xmath40-axis ' and the position of the centre of the bead when it is half - way between the stops ` the origin ' , the would - be wave function , @xmath42 , of the centre - of - mass degree of freedom of the bead in its ground state will , of course , be given by @xmath179 and thus according to standard quantum mechanics , its momentum in the @xmath40-direction will take one of the two values @xmath180 with equal probabilities and hence the expectation value , @xmath181 , will be @xmath182 , whereas , by ( [ compsquared ] ) , according to our naive pragmatic interpretation , it will be approximately @xmath183    in standard quantum mechanics , one way to experimentally determine the expectation value of @xmath184 ( or indeed to obtain the full statistical distribution of @xmath185 values ) of the state of such a system might be to rigidly attach a light flat mirror ( with diameter much larger than @xmath186 ) to the bead , perpendicular to the @xmath40 direction and , after each time resetting the bead to be in the state under investigation , repeatedly to reflect off the mirror a small probe particle ( with mass much less than @xmath11 ) whose quantum mechanical wavepacket is each time prepared to be an approximately monochromatic pencil - shaped wavepacket with diameter much bigger than @xmath186 , aimed at the mirror along a line at an angle of @xmath187 to the @xmath40-axis ( see figure 1 ) , with approximate momentum @xmath188 pointing in the direction of the pencil and say @xmath0[note : pencil]@xmath1 much larger in magnitude than @xmath189 .",
    "if the mirror was fixed rigidly , this pencil would of course turn through a right - angle when it reflects off the mirror but because the mirror is fixed to the bead , its ( standard quantum - mechanical ) state will be a superposition ( or more generally a mixture of superpositions ) of wave functions @xmath190 each of which , in its turn , is of course a superposition of states with momenta @xmath191 .",
    "therefore ( see note @xmath0[note : pencil]@xmath1 ) the probe particle would be predicted to emerge in one of the ( approximate ) directions @xmath192 with a probability depending on the state in the usual way .        by observing the intensity distribution of probe particles on a suitable screen one",
    "could thus infer the probability distribution of the state of the bead and , in particular , deduce the value of @xmath193 .",
    "in particular , if the mirror were in its ground state ( [ beadground ] ) , one would have probability @xmath194 of the probe particle emerging in each of the ( approximate ) directions @xmath195 ( two spots on the screen of equal intensity ) and infer @xmath196 while , in any other state , other directions would be populated ( two more widely spaced spots or more than two spots on the screen etc . ) and the value inferred for @xmath193 would be the appropriate standard quantum mechanical value .",
    "however , we will now argue that , on the newtonian approximation of @xcite , according to our naive pragmatic interpretation  applied now to a model closed system consisting of our bead - with - mirror plus probe - particle system  the result of such an experiment will always be identical with the result predicted by standard quantum mechanics , i.e. the result which , according to standard quantum mechanics , would lead one to infer that the value of @xmath193 is the standard quantum mechanical value .",
    "thus , in particular , if we always reset the bead to be in its ground state , the value inferred for @xmath193 will be @xmath182 and not the value given in ( [ beadpsquared ] ) .",
    "to see this , it is convenient to adopt a ` time - dependent ' approach to the reflection of our probe particles from the mirror . denoting the ground state of the bead by @xmath42 and",
    "the would - be ` in ' wave function for a wave - packet description of the state of one of our probe particles at a time well before it hits the mirror by @xmath197 , so that the total ` in ' wave function of the bead - probe - particle system is given by @xmath198 let us denote by @xmath199 the time - evolute , according to the appropriate standard schrdinger time - evolution , of @xmath200 at the time of observation of the probe particle on the screen and denote by @xmath201 the projector @xmath202 and by @xmath203 the projector @xmath204 .",
    "then the newtonian approximation of @xcite tells us that the total physical density operators @xmath205 and @xmath206 at the two times will be given by ( cf .",
    "( [ 1.4 ] ) ) @xmath207 and @xmath208 where , we remark , amongst its several properties , the only relevant property of @xmath17 for the present argument will be that @xmath209 in the above thought - experiment , the result of any measurement of the statistical distribution of probe particles on the screen will , according to the naive pragmatic interpretation , arise from a formula of the form @xmath210 where @xmath211 is the same function of the position of the probe particle that would be taken to represent the relevant observable in standard quantum mechanics .",
    "we have @xmath212 but in view of ( [ exptrhoin ] ) and ( [ ddiag ] ) this is the same thing as @xmath213 which is of course the same result which would be predicted for the same measurement in standard quantum mechanics . in particular , the statistical distribution of probe particles observed on the screen when we perform our experiment with the mirror in its ground state will be identical with that predicted according to standard quantum mechanics , which is what we set out to show .    one might of course choose to do a different sort of experiment to determine @xmath193 of the state of our mirror  perhaps involving photons as probe particles and making use of optical devices such as interferometers etc .",
    "there is then , admittedly , some uncertainty as to what the predictions of the theory in @xcite would be because of the relativistic nature of the photon and hence the inapplicability of the newtonian approximation of @xcite . but",
    "assuming ( we shall return to this below ) photons can , for this purpose , be treated as if they were non - relativistic particles ( perhaps with a tiny mass ) then e.g. an experimental arrangement which results in a detection of which of two optical channels a probe particle or photon goes down or an experimental arrangement which results in the examination of an interference pattern on a screen would , by these arguments , both give the identical result to that predicted by standard quantum mechanics , since both sorts of measurements are types of position measurement .",
    "we remark that similar considerations lead us to conclude that the results of experiments along the lines of those of folman et al @xcite , to detect changes in parity of certain quantum mechanical states due to possible deviations from standard quantum mechanical laws , will , on the theory of @xcite ( and continuing to assume our reasoning continues to apply when some of the particles are photons ) be identical to the results predicted by standard quantum mechanics , in spite of the fact that our naive pragmatic interpretation predicts changes in the expectation value of parity as in our formula ( [ tracerhop ] ) .",
    "the reason for this is again that the folman et al experiment ultimately involves a type of position measurement ( again of a photon ) .",
    "in fact quite generally , for any sort of experiment , as long as the result is obtained by a position measurement of some sort , to the extent that the approximation of @xcite is valid , if we apply the theory of @xcite to the closed total system consisting of the system of interest together with any relevant probe particles or ` pointer variables ' etc . and adopt our naive pragmatic interpretation for this closed total system , then an adaptation of the above proof in the case of the bead example shows that the result of our measurement will be identical to the result predicted by standard quantum mechanics . to see this ,",
    "suppose the total system consists of @xmath45 bodies in all ( protons , electrons etc . ) and replace the variables @xmath214 in the above proof by the @xmath45 positions of all of these .",
    "( it may be helpful to think of @xmath40 as standing for , say , @xmath215 ` system ' variables @xmath216 and @xmath217 as standing for @xmath218 ` pointer variables ' @xmath219 and we shall refer to this way of thinking in the next few parenthetical remarks . )",
    "then the above proof goes through , thinking now of @xmath201 as the total would - be density operator at the time of preparation of the experiment and @xmath203 as its schrdinger time - evolute at the time of the measurement , @xmath211 as the appropriate position operator ( i.e. an appropriate function of all the @xmath220 ) and taking the integrations to now be over the @xmath221-dimensional total configuration space .",
    "the key point is again that the relevant decoherence exponent ( now a function of the 2n vector variables @xmath222 ; @xmath223 ; @xmath224 ; @xmath225 ) will vanish on the diagonal ( i.e. when @xmath226 , @xmath227 ) .",
    "this completes the proof of our general _",
    "position measurement theorem _ which we referred to in the introduction .    in our _ corrected pragmatic interpretation",
    "_ we assume that a realistic measurement actually consists of a whole ( heisenberg - von neumann ) chain of measurements  each of which is a measurement in the sense we have been discussing up to now  as explained in the very well - known discussion in chapter 6 of von neumann s book @xcite .",
    "thus , for example , in the bead / mirror - probe - particle example with which we opened this section , the dynamics of the bead / mirror - probe - particle system are not the end of the story : the measurement of the position of the probe particle on the screen can in turn be analyzed by including the physics behind the formation of our spots on the screen . let us suppose , for example that the spots consist of black grains of metallic silver formed when our probe particle hits a silver - iodide - coated screen .",
    "then we would incorporate the screen too in the total quantum system and include suitable terms in the total hamiltonian to describe the formation of the silver granules .",
    "then one could perform yet another step of this sort to incorporate the physical mechanism by which light is used to measure the position of the silver - granule - spots and then by which the eye records the state of the light etc . etc .",
    "however far down such a chain one goes , our above _ position measurement theorem _ will ensure that one will obtain the same result which is predicted by standard quantum mechanics , provided only that , at the stage of the chain at which one chooses to stop and apply the rule ( [ 1.6 ] ) , the measurement is a sort of position measurement .",
    "we could then simply declare @xmath0[note : bellink]@xmath1 that the only realistic measurements are those where one does stop at a point of the von neumann chain which consists of a sort of position measurement . alternatively and again following a well - known line of argumentation ( cf .",
    "e.g. @xcite ) and cf .",
    "also the interesting recent paper @xcite of geoffrey sewell ) one could argue that , whatever may be the cause of the irreversibility , it is , in practice , only at a stage of the chain after something macroscopic and in practice irreversible has happened ( such as the formation of our silver granules ) that a measurement has really been made @xmath0[note : undo]@xmath1 and thereafter it is , in practice , immaterial whether the subsequent stages of the chain are analysed with quantum or with classical physics and , in view of that , it can not make any difference if , insisting on still analysing quantum mechanically things which might be analysed classically , we decide to choose a stage of the chain in which the measurement is a sort of position measurement ",
    "e.g. a pointer reading on a dial .    our _ corrected pragmatic interpretation _ consists in adopting either of these points of view ; it does nt matter which .",
    "all that matters is that , for one reason or another , we take the view that a realistic measurement consists of a sort of position measurement at some point of the heisenberg - von neumann chain . with our above _ position measurement theorem _",
    "we then immediately conclude ( as already stated in the introduction )    _ on our corrected pragmatic interpretation , the experimental predictions of the newtonian approximation of @xcite are identical with those of standard quantum mechanics ! _",
    "@xmath228    returning momentarily to our bead / mirror - probe - particle example , we remark that , actually , if the probe particle is sufficiently light ( but we continue to use the non - relativistic theory of @xcite ) then @xmath229 will be well - approximated by a function , say @xmath230 , of @xmath40 and @xmath231 only , so that @xmath232 thus , for any observable @xmath86 which refers to the probe particle so that , formally , it can be represented by a kernel @xmath233 which is only a function of @xmath217 and @xmath234 , we will have @xmath235 which by ( [ halfdeco ] ) is approximately equal to @xmath236 which , in view of @xmath237 , is equal to @xmath238 i.e. to @xmath239    this result will obviously generalize so as to conclude that , on our naive pragmatic interpretation , the results of _ any _ sort of measurement on a probe particle at some stage of a heisenberg - von neumann chain of measurement , will , if the probe particle is sufficiently light , be _ approximately _ the same as the results predicted by standard quantum mechanics .",
    "however , we would nt assign as much importance to this result as to our _ position measurement theorem _ because it is only approximate and also because , in some given measurement chain , it may only apply e.g. at a stage of the measurement chain before classicality and irreversbility have set in .",
    "in such a case , we would still rather rely on our position measurement theorem , applied at a later stage of the measurement chain where the measurement is , e.g. on a macroscopic pointer ( which may well not be so light that one could make the above approximation ) in order to justify the statement ( a ) .",
    "as we have mentioned , all our results assume that the entire chain of measurements involves only non - relativistic particles , whereas , in practice ( an example is the penrose experiment we shall discuss in detail below ) photons are often involved at some stage(s ) of the chain .",
    "this is a gap which needs to be filled .",
    "however , we would expect that , provided ( in the lab frame ) the relevant photon states are not too energetic and provided they are sufficiently far from being on the verge of black - hole collapse then they may be treated as if they are non - relativistic particles with a tiny mass .",
    "in particular , we shall assume this to be the case for the photons in the penrose experiment which we discuss next .    of particular interest to us",
    "are interferometer - like experiments along the lines of those suggested by penrose @xcite , @xcite to detect the ` collapse of the wavepacket ' of certain ` schrdinger cat - like ' macroscopic quantum superpositions as predicted by certain theoretical proposals for modifications of standard quantum mechanics , notably collapse - model proposals such as that of grw @xcite and the proposal of penrose himself @xcite concerning his gravity - induced ` quantum state reduction ' . in one of its simpler versions @xmath0[note : felix]@xmath1 , the setup proposed by penrose is reproduced here in figure 2 .        as described in @xcite , a photon , emitted from a source ,",

    "the movable mirror is attached to an oscillator and ( in a classical description ) initially at rest .",
    "the mass of the movable mirror , the spring constant of the oscillator , the frequency of the photon and the spacing of the movable mirror and the second fixed mirror are tuned so that ( staying with a classical description )    _ in component ` a ' of the superposition ( in which the photon hits the movable mirror ) its first encounter will set the movable mirror into motion , while its second encounter will occur at the movable mirror s initial location and bring it back to rest there  the movable mirror swinging to and from a macroscopically different location in between . _",
    "@xmath241    the positions of all the mirrors are also tuned so that , according to a standard quantum mechanical analysis ,    _ both components of the photon would arrive back at the beam splitter at the same time and with relative phases such that they reassemble into a state which travels back towards the photon source , with no photons detected at the detector ( see figure 2 ) placed at the appropriate angle to that direction to catch any photons which might have emerged from the beam - splitter in its alternative direction .",
    "_    this standard quantum mechanical prediction depends however on the laws of quantum mechanics applying even though , at an intermediate stage of the experiment ( i.e. between the two reflections of component @xmath86 of the photon with the movable mirror ) the total quantum state of the system is a superposition involving two macroscopically different positions of a macroscopic object , i.e. of the movable mirror .",
    "if a ` wave - function collapse ' of this superposition occurs , e.g. as predicted by penrose s 1996 proposal @xcite , then one would predict that , in consequence , the coherence of the superposition of the two components of the photon beam as they reconverge on the beam - splitter will be lost and therefore that photons will arrive at the source and at the detector with equal probabilities .    in this way",
    ", the penrose experiment should be able to distinguish between standard quantum mechanics and the gravitational - induced quantum state reduction proposal of penrose 1996 @xcite ( or between standard quantum mechanics and one or other collapse model ) .",
    "one might at first sight expect that kay s 1998 theory ( i.e. the newtonian approximate theory @xcite based on kay s hypothesis @xcite ) would also predict a similar non - standard result for this penrose experiment ( for suitably large crystals etc . ) .",
    "after all , as we have seen , for suitably large crystals etc .",
    ", that theory too predicts the decoherence of superpositions involving macroscopically different configurations .",
    "however , our general result above tells us ( assuming , as we have discussed above , that the result still applies when the probe particles whose position is being measured are photons ) that this ca nt be . just as for any other experiment which ends in a position measurement , the prediction must be identical with the result predicted by standard quantum mechanics .",
    "this difference between the predictions of penrose s 1996 proposal @xcite and of kay s 1998 theory @xcite for the penrose experiment may be attributed to the following difference : in penrose s work @xcite it is assumed that once a macroscopic system enters a sufficiently macroscopic superposition ( in the present case involving the movable mirror in two macroscopically different locations after the first reflection off it by component @xmath86 of the photon ) then that superposition will collapse _ and remain collapsed irrespective of its future dynamics_. ( the same property holds in most collapse models . ) in @xcite on the other hand , the macroscopic superposition formed after the first reflection of component @xmath86 of the photon at the movable mirror will decohere but then , at the second reflection _ recohere _ ( but we emphasize that this is a feature of the newtonian approximate theory @xcite , not of the full hypothesis of @xcite  see the remarks at the end of the following subsection and in section [ sect : discussion ] ) .",

    "on the other hand , the theory of @xcite , under the approximation of @xcite would ( see notes @xmath0[note : d]@xmath1 and @xmath0[note : timev]@xmath1 ) require the replacement of the initial density operator @xmath266 , @xmath267 as in ( [ photonmirror ] ) on @xmath268 by the partial trace , @xmath269 of @xmath270 over @xmath7 where @xmath271 is a suitable replacement for @xmath267 on @xmath272 ( @xmath273 ) . in the formalism of @xcite ( cf .",

    "note @xmath0[note : timev]@xmath1 and also the last paragraph in section [ sect : entropy ] ) because the gravitational state - vector @xmath276 depends only on the state of the movable mirror at the time @xmath61 and not on its history and therefore , since ( reverting to the classical description which is relevant here ) the movable mirror returns to its initial position at time @xmath252 , we will have @xmath282 @xmath0[note : furtherinsight]@xmath1 .",
    "of course , in a fully relativistic treatment , this is expected no longer to be the case and in particular , if the motion of the movable mirror between times @xmath278 and @xmath252 causes the emission of one or more ` gravitons ' then one would expect @xmath283 ( approximately ) in consequence of which the partial density operator @xmath284 of the photon at time @xmath252 ( and hence the experimental prediction ) will coincide with @xmath285 . however , an order of magnitude estimate shows that , with typical experimental values for the mass and size and frequency of the movable mirror , the amplitude to emit a graviton will be tiny on time - scales relevant to the experiment @xmath0[note : graviton]@xmath1 .",

    "to explain the first difference , we first need to notice that the blp master equation ( [ blp ] ) is itself of a quite different nature to ( [ gaussmaster ] ) in that ( see note @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 ) it holds unrestrictedly for any @xmath14 but only for positive times , whereas ( [ gaussmaster ] ) is only meaningful for @xmath14 for which @xmath345 takes the special form ( [ 1.1 ] ) but then holds both for positive and negative times .",

    "second , the above ` one - sided ' entropy - increase result for the blp master equation ( [ blp ] ) holds _ irrespective _ of the choice of hamiltonian @xmath65 in ( [ blp ] ) .",
    "in contrast , the two - sided entropy - increase result for our master equation ( [ gaussmaster ] ) which we obtained above in the case that @xmath65 in ( [ gaussmaster ] ) is the free hamiltonian @xmath319 , depended on the form of the hamiltonian . indeed",

    "this second difference can be traced ( see notes @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 and @xmath0[note : mdm]@xmath1 ) to the difference that master equations of gks / l form such as blp arise from tracing over ` radiation ' type modes which ` fly away ' whereas our master equation ( [ gaussmaster ] ) arises ( cf .",

    "the relevance of the two - sided entropy result obtained in this section for our gaussian model to the general understanding of the second law entailed by the hypothesis of @xcite will be discussed in the next ( discussion ) section .",
    "our main purpose has been to explore further the non - relativistic approximate theory of @xcite which , as argued in @xcite and explained in the introduction , is expected to be the non - relativistic limit of any full theory of quantum gravity consistent with the hypothesis of @xcite which , in its turn , as argued in @xcite ( see also note @xmath0[note : resolutions]@xmath1 ) offers a natural resolution to the several puzzles and problems mentioned at the start of the introduction and in note @xmath0[note : puzzles]@xmath1 .",

    "after all , for large macroscopic systems , the difference between the mathematical quantities @xmath14 and @xmath356 can be huge by any measure .",
    "on the other hand , the conclusions of @xcite that quantum gravitational effects could have any sort of big effect on every - day laboratory sized quantum systems were themselves surprising .",
    "so it is perhaps reassuring that we have now arrived at the conclusion that ( in the non - relativistic regime ) they do nt have any _ measurable _ effect after all .",
    "the way in which they manage not to have a measurable effect , however , is rather subtle and despite the experimental indistinguishability , the theory of @xcite possesses properties and prospects quite different from those of standard quantum mechanics as we now discuss .",
    "first and foremost , the theory of @xcite achieves the goal of replacing standard quantum mechanics by a modified theory in which macroscopic ( ` schrdinger cat - like ' ) superpositions are absent .",
    "as far as the achievement of this goal is concerned , it would , indeed , seem to be an attractive rival e.g. to the ` collapse models ' such as that of grw @xcite and others , which achieve the same goal at the expense of certain ad hoc modifications of quantum mechanics ( and which also entail certain small modifications to the experimental consequences ) .",
    "it is interesting to notice that , in the light of the present work , one realizes that it would have been possible to achieve the same goal simply by positing that the usual pure density operator ( [ rhonought ] ) of standard quantum mechanics should be replaced by a physical density operator given by ( [ rhophysical ] ) with @xmath17 _ any _ ( ad hoc ) _ choice _ of function on _ configuraton  space _  @xmath357  _ configuration  space _ ( perhaps quite unrelated to quantum gravity ) designed to have the properties ( a ) and ( b ) above ( and the other general properties stated after equation ( [ 1.4 ] ) ) . for , once one posits any such replacement , one will be able to prove a _ position measurement theorem _ and to propose a _ corrected pragmatic interpretation _ etc",
    "to the best of our knowledge , however , no such proposal had hitherto been made . in any case , the proposal with our approximate theory of @xcite would ( in the absence of any current experimental guidance ) seem to be more satisfactory than that with any such ad hoc choice of @xmath17 and also more satisfactory than the resolution achieved with any ad hoc collapse model , not only because it is less ad hoc , but also insofar as it is part and parcel of the hypothesis of @xcite which offers a much more wide - ranging collection of simultaneous resolutions to several other puzzles as explained at the outset of the introduction and in notes @xmath0[note : puzzles]@xmath1 , @xmath0[note : tradblack]@xmath1 , @xmath0[note : entangle]@xmath1 , @xmath0[note : resolutions]@xmath1 and @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 .",
    "the fact that our non - relativistic approximate theory manages to resolve the schrdinger cat puzzle ( i.e. by eliminating all macroscopic schrdinger cat - like superpositions ) while preserving ( on our corrected pragmatic interpretation ) exactly the same experimental predictions as standard quantum mechanics might be regarded as another advantage .",
    "but it also of course means that , viewed in its own right , it is only what one might call a",
    "_ philosophical _ resolution in that it leads to a changed ontology ( i.e. with no schrdinger cat - like macroscopic superpositions ) from that of standard quantum mechanics but makes no experimentally distinguishable predictions .",

    "however , unlike ( [ rhophysical ] ) and its associated master equation ( [ newton ] ) , one expects a new sort of rule determining the time - evolution of @xmath92 which incorporates the back - reaction on our many - body matter from radiated gravitons .",
    "we would not necessarily expect this new rule to obey an exact master equation but , in suitable models , we would expect there to be a preferred zero - moment of time at which the entropy is a minimum  the many - body post - newtonian counterpart to the moment ( @xmath323 in ( [ wavespread ] ) ) of minimum entropy in our one - dimensional gaussian model example of section [ sect : entropy ]  and , while , of course , one now expects the rule which determines @xmath92 at other times to depend on the underlying total time - zero state and not just on the physically relevant density operator @xmath358 ( which is its partial trace over gravity ",
    "see the beginning of subsection [ sect : background ] ) , we would expect , in view of the considerations discussed in note @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 , that , _ for positive times _ @xmath92 will _ approximately _ obey a master equation of schematic form @xmath363+\\hbox{\\textit{newton}}\\,\\rho   + \\hbox{\\textit{postnewton}}\\,\\rho\\ ] ] where _ postnewton _ is approximately of gks / l form while , _ for negative times _ it will approximately obey a similar master equation but with the term _ postnewton _ replaced by a term _ antipostnewton _ which is of anti - gks / l form @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 .",
    "the reason is that ( for positive times ) the post newtonian terms will arise by , at each time , tracing the full matter - gravity ( pure ) density operator over modes of the gravitational field which are _ radiative _ ( see @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 ) , and , unlike the non - radiative modes which , in virtue of being ` dragged around ' by the matter are responsible for the special features of _ newton _ as we discussed in subsection [ sect : penrose ] , section [ sect : entropy ] and note @xmath0[note : mdm]@xmath1 , radiative modes will , of course , be expected to fly away from the matter .",
    "( and there is of course a similar argument for the expected anti - gks / l property for negative times . )",
    "moreover , while the terms _ postnewton _ and _ antipostnewton _ are expected to be negligibly tiny in comparison to _ newton _ in the newtonian regime ( see note @xmath0[note : graviton]@xmath1 ) , we would expect that , as one moves away from the newtonian regime , they will become comparable in size , and as one approaches an extreme relativistic regime , they will be much more important .",
    "so one might say that the non - relativistic approximate theory , which is the main subject of the present paper , is expected to just be the small non - relativistic tip of a large relativistic iceberg !",
    "( of course , the possibility of describing @xmath14 as a many - particle density operator will presumably break down at some point and need to be replaced e.g. by a description in terms of quantum fields or strings etc . )",
    "we next turn to discuss the issue of which systems deserve to be considered _ closed _ for our various purposes . as we have indicated towards the beginning of subsection [ sect : purpose ] and warned in several places above , it was already concluded in @xcite that , at least as far as the concept of entropy is concerned , ordinary small laboratory - sized non - relativistic systems can not be considered closed .",
    "we shall next recall the reasoning behind this conclusion and shall then discuss whether or not such a conclusion should also apply to the other matters under discussion here  notably our conclusions about the penrose ( and other ) experiment(s ) and our tentative interepretation in terms of events .    by a well - known discussion",
    "( see e.g. the article by joos in @xcite ) based on the argument that there will always inevitably be quantum mechanical entanglement over widely spatially separated subsystems , one can argue that it only really can make exact sense to regard a subsystem of the universe as closed and to regard its underlying state as describable by a pure ( i.e. vector ) state if the subsystem is the entire universe .",
    "indeed , at a classical level , it was famously pointed out by emil borel in 1914 that the motion of a few grams of material on the star , sirius , would , just because of its gravitational interaction , after a short time , significantly change the configuration of a gas in a box on the earth .",
    "similar considerations at a quantum level ( and for not - necessarily gravitational interactions ) make it plausible that , in a quantum description , in the actual state of the universe there will be a considerable degree of entanglement between a bit of gas in a box on the earth and a bit of gas in the star sirius etc .",
    "( for a discussion of all this , see for example chapter 3 by e. joos in @xcite )    however , one can ask whether it is legitimate to assume a given system is closed for the purposes of some given calcuation  if one is content with a good approximate ( rather than an exact ) answer . we know from experience that , for many questions , such an assumption can be successful for laboratory - sized systems .",
    "otherwise standard quantum mechanical calculations would not be anything like as successful as they actually are .",
    "however , if our purpose is the explanation , on the hypotheses of @xcite , and within the approximate newtonian framework of @xcite of how e.g. a box of gas in the laboratory can have an entropy comparable to the usual entropy one would calculate for a thermal equilibrium state at say room temperature , then it appears , from the preliminary model calculations reported in @xcite that this can not be done : the typical entropies we calculate ( see @xcite ) , while non - zero , are orders of magnitude smaller .",
    "our conclusion from this is not that the theory of @xcite or the calculations are wrong , but rather that hot boxes of gas in the laboratory can not be regarded as closed systems .",
    "rather , as we discuss further in note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 ( see also figures 4 and 5 ) we conclude that the entropy of such systems needs to be explained by regarding them to be open systems and is due to tracing over a total environment , part of which is gravitational , but the main part of which is essentially the same matter environment which ( on one standard view about the origin of the entropy of gases in boxes  see the last paragraph of note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 ) would usually be held responsible for their entropy .",
    "it then becomes an important question , whether , to get physically correct values for the entropy of such laboratory - sized systems and to get physical thermodynamic behaviour ( i.e. a ` second - law ' result to the effect that the entropy of a closed system always increases ) it could suffice to regard as closed , say , the solar system , or whether one needs to include our whole galaxy or whether one actually needs to go as far as the entire universe .",
    "we have argued in @xcite and will argue further below that any answer to this question must involve enlargement to a system , parts of which are essentially relativistic in nature ( the remark in note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 about total closed sytems which contain black holes is also relevant to this conclusion ) . thus the galaxy or the entire universe would seem to be the more likely answers . and if the galaxy turns out to be a valid answer , then one might speculate that if it is true , as is currently believed likely , that every large galaxy contains a supermassive black hole , then this fact may play a role in this .",
    "what we have studied in @xcite and in the present paper are small laboratory - sized model systems on the ( we have concluded above as far as entropy is concerned ) counterfactual assumption that they are closed . while not expecting their entropies to be physically realistic , we can endeavour to learn lessons about the mechanisms which give rise to entropy and about the way that entropy tends to vary with time . in @xcite",
    "we considered a number of laboratory - sized model static systems and calculated their entropies on this assumption , and showed , in particular , that these entropies , while ( as we mentioned above ) small , appear to correlate , to some extent , with their degree of ` matter clumping ' . in section [",
    "sect : entropy ] here , we have augmented these results with some first results on the time - dependence of entropy and found , for our gaussian model to first order in @xmath38 ( describing our free bead - on - a - wire model ) a two - sided entropy increase result whereby there is a moment of minimum entropy while , as a result of ` spreading of the would - be wave - packet ' , entropy increases for times on either side of this moment ( i.e. it decreases before this moment and increases after it ) . for more ` realistic ' small non - relativistic many - body systems we would expect there to be a similar two - sided entropy - increase result in suitable circumstances , but we expect the mechanism behind it to involve not only spreading of the would - be wave packet , but also , and in fact often mainly , ` dynamical clumping ' , by which we mean changes in time of the amount of matter clumping . turning to the post - newtonian regime , we would still expect to obtain a two - sided entropy - increase result in suitable models , but we expect the way one will understand mathematically the origin of this result will be different ( and this will be traceable to the different behaviour of the non - radiative and radiative modes which will be responsible for the two regimes  see @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 and @xmath0[note : mdm]@xmath1 ) . in the case of our gaussian model and ( one assumes ) in the case of non - relativistic many - body systems , the demonstration of such a two - sided entropy increase result depended / will presumably depend on a study of the relevant single exact master equation of ` mdm ' type ( see after ( [ newton ] ) which describes the dynamics of @xmath92 . in the post - newtonian regime ,",
    "one expects , instead , that after choosing a suitable model for a low - entropy inital @xmath358 , the demonstration of a two - sided entropy increase result will depend on a study of an appropriate approximate master equation of form ( [ postnewton ] ) for positive times and its negative - time counterpart for negative times . to the extent that one can neglect the _ newton _ terms in these ( cf . our ` tip of iceberg ' remark in the paragraph containing ( [ postnewton ] ) ) the question will be whether or not the gks / l term _ postnewton _ satisfies the criterion of benatti - narnhofer @xcite discussed in note @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 ( etc . for negative times ) .",
    "the interpretation of such two - sided entropy increase results will of course be that , while , theoretically , they represent possible dynamics for all times , positive and negative , in actual physical application , only the positive - time behaviour will be relevant and the negative time part should simply be discarded .",
    "either one has in mind that one s closed system is modelling the whole universe in which case @xmath358 will model the initial state of the universe , or , if one is interested in a model which idealizes some subsystem of the universe as closed ( e.g. a star collapsing to a black hole in an otherwise empty universe as is done in note @xmath0[note : resolutions]@xmath1 ) then @xmath358 will represent the initial state of that system and its low entropy can either be thought of as an assumption of the model or alternatively , perhaps , as ultimately explainable outside the model as traceable back , via processes in the wider universe , to the low entropy of the initial state of the universe .",
    "the notion of ` branch systems ' in @xcite although note that , in view of our remarks above about how large closed systems may have to be , it is a delicate question if / when / how this notion is applicable here . )    of course , the only result we have proven here is our two - sided entropy result , obtained in section [ sect : entropy ] , for our one - dimensional gaussian model , interpretable in terms of a model closed system consisting of our free non - relativistic bead on a wire .",
    "this is of course a thoroughly counterfactual model closed system but nevertheless our result is of value as a first entropy - increase result on the hypothesis of @xcite .",
    "if that hypothesis and the extra assumptions involved in @xcite are correct , then that model will , as we have indicated above , be of some significance as one extreme tip ( it concerns only one single small non - relativistic bead ) of a non - relativistic many - body tip ( cf .",
    "the paragraph containing (    [ postnewton ] ) ) of a full relativistic iceberg which is the second law of thermodynamics !    the other side of the coin to entropy increase ( on the hypothesis of @xcite ) is of course dynamical _ decoherence _ since , after all , aside from its role in thermodynamics , our @xmath107 can be thought of as a measure of the ` amount of decoherence ' of our closed system .",
    "so , if our expectations concerning results of second - law type for suitable ( say , laboratory - sized non - relativistic ) models are fulfilled , then we will be able to say that , for suitable ` time - zero ' initial total states , the amount of decoherence will always increase .",
    "thus , returning to our comparison with theories of ` collapse model ' type , we will be able to say that our non - relativistic approximate theory shares with ` collapse models ' ( i.e. in addition to eliminating schrdinger cat - like superpositions as discussed above ) the ability to predict a continual process of decoherence .",
    "( the way that grw does this is mentioned in note @xmath0[note : gks / l]@xmath1 . )",
    "however , the comparison of the two sorts of theories has to be more complicated than that , since , as we have argued above , small laboratory systems can not , on our theory be regarded , for the purposes of calculating entropy , as closed . regarding them , instead , as open ( as discussed in note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 ) we see that , instead , our theory ( i.e. of @xcite ) entails , as far as its predictions of decoherence are concerned , essentially the same predictions as ( see note @xmath0[note : resolutions]@xmath1 ) the usual ` environment induced decoherence paradigm ' .",
    "( see however the next - but - two paragraph . )",
    "turning to our tentative notion of ` events ' defined according to the passage labelled ( b ) in section ( [ sect : purpose ] ) , we have to expect that , for related reasons to those given above , the detailed structure of the set of events and their probabilities and of the way these change with time will differ considerably , for a large relativistic closed system , from the structure etc .",
    "of this set etc .",
    "when one analyses simple non - relativistic models of closed systems as in section [ sect : events ] .",
    "nevertheless , the results of section [ sect : events ] are still of interest as a model within which one can attempt to explore what might be the mechanism by which such an events - based interpretation might be able to supplant the stop - gap naive and corrected pragmatic interpretations discussed in sections [ sect : naive ] and [ sect : expt ] .",
    "what one hopes for here is to have a theory which explains how quantities such as position and momentum and parity etc . which are treated as ` observables ' in our naive and corrected pragmatic interpretations _ emerge _ in some suitable sense from an events interpretation . our discussion , in section [ sect : events ] ( see also note @xmath0[note : beable]@xmath1 ) of the relationship between equations ( [ tracerhopeven ]    and ( [ paritycoincidence ] ) in the context of our one - dimensional gaussian model , appears to give a promising indication , for the example of ` parity ' of how this can happen and the challenge which remains is to study whether an explanation along the lines indicated by that example , of the emergence of less primitive observables in more complicated ( many - body ) examples",
    "we emphasize that even if a theory along such lines for how observables emerge from our events interpretation is possible , it is not obvious that it will be possible staying within the context of small non - relativistic model closed systems .",
    "after all , we argued above that for questions related to entropy and thermodynamics , such models need to be rejected in favour of models of large relativistic closed systems",
    ". however the small success of our discussion of parity encourages us to hope that , for these different purposes , our small non - relativistic models may suffice .",
    "indeed , it seems conceivable that , even though a different , and perhaps richer and ultimately arguably more ` physical ' , theory of events would be had for large relativistic models of closed systems and by treating actual ordinary laboratory - sized systems as open subsystems of these , the theory obtained by modelling actual ordinary ( non - relativistic ) laboratory - sized systems as closed may , in itself , yield a viable events - based replacement for standard quantum mechanics .",
    "concomitantly , one might possibly argue that , returning to our comparison between our theory and ` collapse models ' , if we treat a given small non - relativistic laboratory - sized system as if it is ` closed ' for the purposes of calculating its entropy , @xmath107 , then , while the resulting @xmath107 should not be taken seriously as having anything to do with thermodynamics or ` true extent of decoherence ' , it might still be an interesting measure of ` decoherence relevant to the model ' and might , under certain circumstances , always increase .    finally , returning to our naive and pragmatic interpretations which we discussed at the outset , we return to the question whether it is justified , for the results which were obtained within them ( including our position measurement theorem and including our analysis of the penrose experiment ) to be taken to be physically relevant .",
    "the question is whether such matters can ( unlike what we argued above for questions of entropy and thermodynamics ) be discussed in the context of the models of small non - relativistic closed systems which we have considered here .",
    "another way of putting this is to ask whether , e.g. in our discussion of the penrose experiment , we can ignore entanglement of our small model closed systems with the environment .",
    "the answer would seem to be that it is justified since ( cf .",
    "note @xmath0[note : open]@xmath1 ) the issue of entanglement of such systems with the environment within our theory is more or less the same as what would usually be regarded as the issue of the entanglement of such systems with the environment and this is , of course ( see especially @xcite ) precisely the issue which makes the penrose experiment so difficult ( but not impossible ) to perform and which the experiment is designed to overcome .",

    "this could be studied exactly , but we content ourselves here with solving the simpler problem where @xmath14 is replaced by its first order in @xmath38 form , which shall call @xmath368 , @xmath369 where @xmath370 and the resulting eigenvalue equation is solved to first order in @xmath38 .",
    "it is useful to note , that , in dirac notation , @xmath368 may be written @xmath371 taking this as our starting point , we can make the following perturbation - theoretic argument : if @xmath38 is small , we expect @xmath14 , and hence also @xmath368 to have an eigenvector close to @xmath372 , and that its eigenvalue will be close to unity .",
    "thus we write this first eigenvector as @xmath373 where @xmath374 is not yet normalized and we assume the orthogonality condition , @xmath375 holds . as @xmath376 , and @xmath14 is positive",
    "( we will confirm that @xmath368 is positive for sufficiently small @xmath38 below ) we expect that the eigenvalue of @xmath374 will be slightly less than unity so we write @xmath377 where @xmath23 is to be determined . from ( [ 2.3 ] ) , ( [ 2.4 ] ) , and ( [ 2.5 ] ) we get @xmath378 we can obtain @xmath379 from ( [ 2.6 ] ) by expanding out the brackets to give @xmath380 and substituting the expression for @xmath381 , given in ( [ 2.3 ] ) , into the above equation gives @xmath382 by only keeping terms up to order @xmath38 in ( [ 2.6 ] ) we get @xmath383 now acting on ( [ 2.8 ] ) with @xmath384 it can be seen that @xmath385 where @xmath386 note that the above is the uncertainty in position of the would - be wave function ( as we call it in subsection [ sect : background ] ) .",

    "since the sum of the eigenvalues we have found so far is 1 ( @xmath398 ) and on the assumption that @xmath368 , like @xmath14 is positive , it must be that the orthogonal complement to the ( two - dimensional ) subspace spanned by the eigenvectors we have found so far must consist entirely of eigenvectors with eigenvalue zero ( to first order in @xmath38 ) .",
    "thus , to first order in @xmath38 , we have found all eigenvectors and eigenvalues of @xmath368 and ( to this order ) these are obviously the same as for @xmath14 .",
    "we remark that an alternative derivation of the same result , and confirmation that , for sufficiently small @xmath38 , @xmath368 is positive , may be had by noting that ( still with our specialization to @xmath26 either even or odd ) to first order in @xmath38 , ( [ 2.3 ] ) may be written @xmath399 this is in the canonical form , @xmath400 _ except that _ the vectors which appear , while orthogonal , are not normalized . to remedy this , we easily have ( to first order ) : @xmath401 ( where , for convenience , we resume our abbreviation of @xmath312 by @xmath23 ) so that ( again , all equalities are to first order ) the normalized vector is @xmath402 and also @xmath403 we can now replace the vectors by their normalized forms at the expense of introducing prefactors equal to the square of their norms . thus @xmath404 from which we can read off the eigenvectors and eigenvalues .",

    "the entropy , thus defined , for a given open subsystem would then necessarily ( cf . note @xmath0[note : entangle]@xmath1 ) equal the entropy of its environment and therefore , as one considers ever larger nested subsystems which eventually approach the total closed system , as indicated in figure 5b by sliding the vertical dividing line to the right , the adage ` what goes up must come down ' would necessarily apply and the entropy would approach the value zero !",
    "so a typical graph of entropy against size of region would , in contrast to figure 5a look like that sketched in figure 5b .",
    "+    + finally , we remark that , in defining the density operator of any open system , the result of tracing over @xmath538 is of course equivalent to first tracing over @xmath7 and then tracing over @xmath539 .",
    "so our proposal is equivalent to a modification of the above - described approach to defining entropy on traditional lines ",
    "i.e. as pictured in figure 4b  in which one identifies ` system ' as ` matter system ' and identifies ` environment ' as ` matter environment ' but , instead of postulating a total state which is pure , one postulates a total state on the full matter system which is equal to the ( mixed ) trace of our matter - gravity @xmath9 over @xmath7 . 13 .",
    "[ note : catpuzzle ] in this note , we shall add a number of further remarks about our resolution to the schrdinger cat puzzle discussed in sections [ sect : intro ] and [ sect : events ] : + we begin by remarking that , in the context of schrdinger cat - like situations , something similar to our mechanism whereby a pure state such as ( [ catintro ] ) gets changed to a mixed density operator like ( [ decocat ] ) or ( approximately  see below ) like ( [ decocatintro ] ) occurs , of course , in the general context of ` environmental induced decoherence ' ( see e.g. @xcite and @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however there are a number of important differences .",
    "first , the ` environmental induced decoherence ' mechanism is only capable of bringing about the replacement of a pure by a mixed state in the case of an _ open _ system , whereas in the theory of @xcite and @xcite , by having a preferred environment ( i.e. gravity ) and declaring that this must always be traced over in principle , such a replacement of pure by mixed states occurs for closed systems .",
    "secondly , something similar to our proposed general interpretation ( see around the passage labelled ( b ) in section [ sect : intro ] and the beginning of section [ sect : events ] ) of our physical density operators in terms of events which happen is usually implicity or explicitly assumed when discussing the interpretation of density operators of form ( [ decocatintro ] )  but it usually seems to be assumed that the events which can happen should be identified with _",
    "one - dimensional _ diagonalising subspaces of the relevant density operator ( and that the probability with which they happen is the associated eigenvalue ) . in the case of ( [ decocatintro ] ) this will not change the interpretation as long as @xmath540 .",
    "but in that special case , on the latter usual interpretation , an ambiguity occurs since the eigenvalue @xmath541 is degenerate .",
    "the existence of this ambiguity in this usual interpretation is sometimes taken as a reason to question whether a formalism based on density operators can really solve the conceptual problems of quantum mechanics .",
    "however our interpretation ( b ) sidesteps this criticism by entailing that , in this same special case , there is only _",
    "one _ possible event which can happen ( with probability 1 ) , namely that corresponding to the subspace spanned by @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "this is free from ambiguity although it is admittedly somewhat strange .",
    "however , the strangeness is perhaps mitigated in that , in a typical preparation of a would - be schrdinger cat - like state , such as ( [ catintro ] ) , the quantities @xmath292 and @xmath293 would be expected to vary in time , and the equalities @xmath542 to only hold for a single moment of time , and hence our interpretation would entail that there are two possible events , each evolving in time , then fusing into one possible event for a fleeting moment before splitting into two ( evolving ) possibilities again . the ball ( or the cat ! ) is still predicted to be one thing or another except at that moment and at no time is the statement about the possible events which can happen ( and the probabilities with which they will happen ) ambiguous .",
    "+ finally we remark that @xmath81 in ( [ decocat ] ) can be small but never actually zero and therefore the density operator ( [ decocatintro ] ) can only be an approximation to ( [ decocat ] ) in note @xmath0[note : d]@xmath1 .",
    "in fact , in general the subspaces belonging to our two events will clearly be one - dimensional subspaces spanned by ( normalizable ) vectors of the form @xmath543 with @xmath544 and @xmath14 will take the form @xmath545 where @xmath86 and @xmath240 are positive numbers with sum 1 and the values of @xmath86 , @xmath240 , @xmath347 and @xmath546 will be determined ( by equating ( [ catdiag ] ) with ( [ decocat ] ) ) in terms of @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath547 .",
    "when , the ball is of mass much smaller than the planck mass and/or the two ball states are close together , @xmath547 will be close to @xmath145 , @xmath86 will be close to 1 , @xmath240 close to zero , @xmath347 close to @xmath292 and @xmath546 close to @xmath293 so there will be one ` event ' with a probability close to 1 which is close to the subspace spanned by @xmath26 of ( [ catintro ] ) while , at the other extreme , returning to the case of almost complete decoherence , as our ball gets larger and/or as the two ball - states get further apart , @xmath347 will be close to 1 and @xmath546 close to zero , and @xmath86 will be close to @xmath97 and @xmath240 will be close to @xmath98 and @xmath347 will get closer to 1 , and @xmath546 closer to zero .",
    "we feel that our statement that this `` is just what one would hope for from a resolution to the schrdinger cat puzzle '' remains equally arguable with this exact description of the event - subspaces . 14 . [",
    "note : asfarasaware ] as far as we are aware , an interpretation in terms of ` events which happen ' along the lines of that proposed here in ( b ) has not been considered previously in the context of models for modified quantum mechanics which are couched in terms of time - evolving density operators .",
    "however , something similar to ( but not quite identical to ) our proposal seems often to be implicitly assumed when considering the physical interpretation of density operators which arise in contexts such as proposed resolutions to the schrdinger cat puzzle ",
