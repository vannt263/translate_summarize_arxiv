    "since 1987 , several globular cluster surveys at jodrell bank , arecibo , parkes and more recently the green bank telescope have found 79 pulsars in a total of 23 globular clusters ( gcs)pfreire / gcpsr.html and references therein ] .",
    "these findings have confirmed that most of the binary millisecond pulsars ( msps ) in gcs have low - mass white dwarf ( wd ) companions and nearly circular orbits , as observed in the galactic disk .",
    "this is an important confirmation of the evolutionary scenarios proposed by alpar  et  al .",
    "( 1982 ) for the formation of msps .    in gcs , _",
    "exchange encounters _ , which only have a significant probability of occurring in dense stellar environments , occasionally exchange one of the components of a binary system with a typically more massive star .",
    "the exchanges may occur during encounters with either other binaries or with isolated stars . in gcs such encounters can place isolated neutron stars into binaries with a main sequence ( ms ) star which eventually evolves , `` recycles '' the neutron star , and finally forms a msp@xmath0wd binary system . such a process explains the anomalously large numbers of msps in gcs ( by mass ) when compared to the galaxy .",
    "if the neutron star placed in orbit around a low - mass ms star is already a pulsar , we observe `` irregular '' eclipsing binary pulsars , such as psr  j0024@xmath07204w in 47  tucanae @xcite , psr  b1718@xmath019 in ngc  6342 @xcite , and psr  j1740@xmath05340 in ngc  6397 @xcite , which are peculiar to gcs .",
    "in this paper we report and discuss the discovery of a unique binary millisecond pulsar , psr  j0514@xmath04002a ( henceforth ngc  1851a ) in the gc ngc  1851 .",
    "we discovered this system in a new 327-mhz survey of gcs carried out using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , at khodad near pune , india .",
    "our 327-mhz survey aims to find faint pulsars with steep radio spectra which would be missed by the high - frequency searches .",
    "it benefits from the large gain of the central array of the gmrt of 4.6k / jy when used in the phased array mode of the array combiner @xcite .",
    "this mode produces a beam on the sky with a diameter of about 3 arcminutes .",
    "the number of spectral channels across the available 16-mhz band is 256 and the sampling interval used is 258@xmath3s .",
    "each observation consists of a pair of 72-minute scans containing 2@xmath4 samples . between scans ,",
    "the 14-antenna central array was re - phased using a reference source .",
    "we observed a set of 16 gcs in 2003 february .",
    "the data were written to tape and taken to mcgill university , where we processed them using the borg ( a 104-processor beowulf cluster dedicated for pulsar processing ) running the presto software package @xcite .",
    "one of the gcs observed was ngc  1851 .",
    "its distance ( @xmath5 ) from the sun is about 12.6  kpc ( cassisi , de santis , & piersimoni 2001 ) , and its galactic coordinates are @xmath6 @xciteharris / mwgc.dat for the updated version of the table of gc parameters presented in this paper ] .",
    "it is a relatively bright gc ( @xmath7 ) with a very condensed core ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the tidal and core radii ) .",
    "it is among the ten clusters in the galaxy with the highest central luminosity density ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "neither of the prominent electron density models of the galaxy make reliable predictions of the electron column density ( normally expressed as the dispersion measure , or dm ) to ngc  1851 .",
    "the taylor & cordes ( 1993 ) model predicts a dm@xmath1228pc@xmath13 for @xmath14kpc , while the cordes & lazio ( 2002 ; ne2001 ) model predicts dm@xmath1245pc@xmath13 for @xmath15kpc .",
    "we therefore dedispersed the raw data at 500 trial dms , from 20 to 70pc@xmath16 and spaced by 0.1  @xmath16pc in order to minimize dispersive smearing and keep the total time resolution of our data between 0.5 and 1.5ms . for each of these dm trials , a full fourier - domain matched - filter - based acceleration search ( ransom , eikenberry , & middleditch 2002 )",
    "was carried out , enabling the detection of binary systems with relatively short orbital periods .",
    "this is only possible because of the computing power of the borg .    in the first scan for ngc  1851 ,",
    "taken 2003 february 10 , we detected a clear pulsed signal with a period of 4.991ms ( see figure [ fig:0514 ] ) .",
    "the signal was present at all frequency channels within the observing band and the arrival times versus frequency are well described by a dm of 52.15(10)pc@xmath13 .",
    "this value will help to refine electron density models of the galaxy in the direction of ngc  1851 .",
    "the observed pulsations had a width of @xmath120.8 ms , which is exactly the time resolution of the system after accounting for the dispersive smearing within each of the 62.5-khz channels and the sampling interval .",
    "the intrinsic pulse is therefore essentially unresolved , implying that future observations with better time and frequency resolution will significantly improve the signal - to - noise and timing precision .",
    "we confirmed this signal in ngc  1851 data taken on the february 10 , 11 and 20 , the signal is not present in pointings made towards other clusters .",
    "this is therefore the first pulsar discovered in ngc  1851 and , incidentally , the first gmrt pulsar discovery .",
    "highly significant changes of the barycentric pulsed period both within and between observations of the cluster immediately identified the pulsar as a member of a binary system .",
    "further observations of ngc  1851 were made in 2003 december in order to determine the orbit of the pulsar , using the same observing system and parameters as for the original search .",
    "an early analysis of the orbital trajectory of the pulsar in the @xmath17-@xmath18 diagram ( freire , kramer , & lyne 2001 ) suggested that the orbit is not circular .",
    "analysis of the rotational periods using tempo proved most surprising : the best - fit model ( see figure  [ fig : periods ] ) indicates @xmath19 , the most eccentric orbit of any known binary pulsar , and several orders of magnitude more eccentric than the typical orbits of fast msps uncertainty , which we conservatively estimate to be ten times the formal value computed by tempo based on the fact that there is still no phase - connected timing solution ] .",
    "the orbital period @xmath20 is 18.7850(8 ) days , and the semi - major axis of the orbit projected along the line - of - sight ( @xmath21 ) is @xmath22 light seconds .",
    "this implies a minimum companion mass of 0.9m@xmath2 , assuming a pulsar mass of 1.35m@xmath2 ( for the median of expected inclinations , 60@xmath23 , the companion mass is 1.1m@xmath2 ) .",
    "the epoch of periastron @xmath24 is mjd = 52984.46(2 ) , the longitude of periastron @xmath25 is @xmath26 and the barycentric rotational period @xmath17 is 4.990576(5 ) ms .",
    "when the pulsar is observed , the cross - correlations between the voltages of all active antennae ( including those outside the central square , which are not directly used to search for the pulsar ) are also recorded .",
    "this allows for simultaneous high - resolution imaging of the cluster .",
    "we found a faint object at @xmath27 ( see figure  [ fig : image ] ) , which is only 0.1arcminutes from the center of the cluster ( @xmath28 , harris 1996 ) .",
    "this places the source , as projected in the plane of the sky , just outside the cluster s @xmath120.06-arcminute core .",
    "such a position is common among the pulsars with known positions within gcs as is expected due to the effects of dynamical friction and mass segregation@xcite .",
    "the flux density @xmath29 for this object is variable .",
    "for example , on the 5 december image , the source is not detectable ( 4@xmath30 limit of 2.4mjy ) , while on 6 , 12 and 30 december it is detectable with flux densities of 5.5@xmath310.5 , 3.5@xmath310.5 and 4.2@xmath310.5mjy , respectively .",
    "this correlates well with the relative intensities of the 4.99-ms pulsed signal for those days .",
    "the brighter source to the north - east , on the other hand , has a constant flux density ( within 10% , which is the typical accuracy of the flux calibration scheme ) .",
    "there is therefore little doubt that the faint source near the center is ngc  1851a .",
    "the image in figure [ fig : image ] is a combination of these four epochs and gives a final estimate of the mean flux density at 325 mhz as 3.4@xmath310.4mjy .",
    "the image shows no other sources of comparable flux density towards the cluster , indicating that we are not missing the detection of bright pulsars because of selection effects such as very short rotational or orbital periods .",
    "we also observed the cluster at 610mhz on 7 and 23 december , as well as 1 january .",
    "we did not detect the pulsar in any of the individual epochs nor in a combined map made from all three observations at a 4-@xmath30 level or better . from the rms noise of 0.1mjy",
    ", we estimate the 610-mhz flux density to be @xmath320.4mjy .",
    "this implies a very steep spectrum , with @xmath33 .",
    "this underlines the relevance of low - frequency surveys ; it is unlikely that this pulsar could have been found at any other frequency .",
    "all known eccentric ( @xmath34 ) binary pulsars in the disk of the galaxy have relatively massive companions .",
    "this varied set of companions includes blue giants , other neutron stars and heavy wds .",
    "blue giants live only a few myr which is probably not long enough to allow the sustained mass accretion required to spin up a pulsar companion to millisecond spin periods .",
    "this is in accordance with the observations , these pulsars have rotational periods of tens or hundreds of ms .",
    "the second supernova event is likely to make the orbit significantly eccentric , presuming the binary survives .",
    "since both stars are now compact , tidal circularization is henceforth impossible .",
    "the prolonged episode of stable mass accretion needed to spin up a neutron star to millisecond periods is only possible from evolved lower - mass ms stars .",
    "such large timescales allow effective tidal orbit circularization as well .",
    "this process likely created the msp currently in ngc  1851a , although with a presently unknown low - mass wd companion .",
    "some msp @xmath35 low - mass white dwarf systems in gcs , like psr  b1802@xmath007 ( @xmath36ms , @xmath37days , @xmath38 , @xcite ) can become mildly eccentric due to interactions with other objects in the cluster @xcite .",
    "this is almost certainly not the origin of the present ngc  1851a binary system since its eccentricity is probably too high to be explained by this mechanism and its companion too massive .",
    "we are therefore lead to the conclusion that after recycling , ngc  1851a exchanged its former low - mass companion with a more massive object .",
    "this is the first system presenting clear evidence of such a process . a massive star ( the pulsar s present companion ) passed within a distance smaller than about four times the separation of the components of the previous binary system .",
    "the most likely outcome from such an event is the formation of an eccentric binary system containing the two more massive objects @xcite .",
    "the low - mass component of the previous binary is ejected , causing the new binary system to recoil in the opposite direction .",
    "the probability for encounters is obviously larger for wider binaries , but the resulting recoil velocities are smaller .",
    "these events lead to relatively wide binaries ( as observed for ngc  1851a ) which are likely to remain near the center of the gcs .",
    "this is consistent with the projected position of ngc  1851a relative to the center of the cluster . if the original binary system is tightly bound , the resulting new binary system is also likely to be very tight",
    ". such an encounter would produce a large recoil velocity and could make the resulting system escape the cluster , or send it to the cluster s outer regions .",
    "there are three previously known eccentric pulsar binaries with massive companions in gcs , but none of them presents such strong evidence of this kind of exchange encounter .",
    "the first is psr  b2127@xmath3511c @xcite , a double neutron star in m15 ( @xmath39ms , @xmath40 , @xmath41days ) .",
    "this system is remarkably similar to the first known galactic binary pulsar , psr  b1913@xmath3516 @xcite ; therefore no mechanisms specific to gcs are needed to explain its formation . however , the fact that this pulsar is much more distant from the center of m15 than any of the other 7 pulsars known in that cluster @xcite hints at an exchange encounter with a powerful recoil from the ejected object .",
    "the second system is psr  j1750@xmath037 , @xcite .",
    "its main characteristics ( @xmath42ms , @xmath43 , @xmath44days ) are very similar to another galactic binary pulsar , psr  j1811@xmath01736 @xcite .",
    "an exchange encounter is , again , not the only possible formation mechanism , but definitely a possibility .",
    "the third system is psr  j2140@xmath02310b , in m30 @xcite , which contains a 13-ms pulsar and @xmath45 .",
    "its rotational period is about half of the smallest rotational period found for the eccentric galactic systems .",
    "the formation of such an object is very likely to require an exchange encounter , but there is still a small probability that this is a msp - massive wd system that became eccentric through distant encounters with other stars , like psr  b1802@xmath007 .",
    "the nature of the companion of ngc  1851a is as yet unclear , it could be either a compact or extended object . in ngc  1851 , a cluster with an age of @xmath129gyr @xcite 1-m@xmath2 stars are now leaving the main sequence . because of the lengthy episode of msp recycling that preceded its formation , the present ngc  1851a binary system is very likely to be a few gyr younger than the cluster in which it lies .",
    "mathieu , meibom and dolan ( 2004 ) have determined that , for the open cluster ngc  188 ( with an age of 7 gyr and a stellar population similar to that of gcs ) , binary systems containing ms stars with orbital periods larger than 15 days have not yet had time to circularize .",
    "therefore , the observed eccentricity of the ngc  1851a system does not rule out the possibility of the companion being an extended object .",
    "in fact , partial and/or irregular `` eclipses '' from an extended object such as a ms star may explain the apparent flux variability from ngc  1851a .",
    "we have discovered a remarkable 5-ms binary pulsar , the first to be found in the gc ngc  1851 and the first pulsar to be discovered with the gmrt .",
    "its orbit is the most eccentric known for any system containing a pulsar , while its rotational period is much shorter than that of any other pulsar in an eccentric binary system .",
    "this indicates that , after becoming an msp by accreting matter from a low - mass companion star , this neutron star has almost certainly exchanged it for its present , significantly more massive companion .",
    "if black holes exist in gcs , a msp - black hole binary could be formed in exactly the same way .",
    "if the companion is a compact object , then two relativistic effects will be measurable , namely the rate of advance of periastron and the einstein delay .",
    "the measurement of both effects would lead to the determination of the masses of the two components of this system . a third relativistic effect , the orbital decay due to emission of gravitational waves , will be masked by the unpredictable acceleration of the binary in the gravitational field of the cluster ,",
    "so no tests of general relativity are likely to be possible .",
    "if the companion is a ms star , we might measure the orbital precession caused by the quadrupole moment of the companion star and possibly a rotation of the orbital plane around the axis of rotation of the companion @xcite .",
    "in addition , variations in dm with orbital phase may be detectable @xcite , particularly if the companion is an active star .",
    "for ngc  1851a none of these effects have been conclusively measured to date .",
