    "if the recently announced diphoton excess at @xmath1  @xcite remains as a true signal , it indicates a long - awaited discovery of new physics beyond the standard model . in a recent paper  @xcite",
    ", we have proposed that this excess may result from a composite spin-@xmath2 particle decaying into a two - photon final state . among the possibilities discussed , here we concentrate on the case in which the particle is a composite pseudo  nambu - goldstone boson associated with new strong dynamics at the tev scale , which is singly produced by gluon fusion and decays into two photons . for works that have appeared around the same time and discussed similar models to those in  @xcite ,",
    "see  @xcite ; other related works include  @xcite .",
    "a class of theories involving similar dynamics with vectorlike matter charged under both hidden and standard model gauge groups was studied in  @xcite .",
    "the possibility of obtaining standard model dibosons from a composite scalar particle was utilized in a different context in  @xcite .    in this paper , we study a simple model presented in ref .",
    "@xcite which introduces an extra gauge group @xmath3 at the tev scale , in addition to the standard model gauge group @xmath4 , with extra matter ",
    "hidden quarks  in the vectorlike bifundamental representation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 . here , @xmath7 is used only as a simple mnemonic ; it does not mean that the three factors of @xmath8 are unified at the tev scale . in this model ,",
    "the diphoton resonance is one of the pseudo  nambu - goldstone bosons  hidden pions  which is neutral under @xmath8 and has the mass of @xmath9 .",
    "we consider this particular model here because it is theoretically simple and leads to predictions that can be tested in the near future .",
    "the only free parameters of the model , beyond the size @xmath10 of @xmath5 , are the dynamical scale of @xmath5 and two ( in general complex ) masses for the hidden quarks , out of which two numbers are fixed by the mass and diphoton rate of the resonance .",
    "we calculate all the masses of the hidden pions , which for a given @xmath10 depend only on a single free parameter :  the ratio of the absolute values of the two hidden quark masses .",
    "we find that two colored hidden pions must be near the current experimental limits ( unless @xmath10 is unreasonably large ) ; they respectively lead to narrow dijet , @xmath11-jet , and @xmath12-jet resonances below @xmath13 and to heavy stable charged and neutral hadrons ( or leptoquark - type resonances ) below @xmath14 .",
    "we also discuss other , higher resonances in the model , which are expected to be in the multi - tev region , as well as the effect of possible @xmath15 violation in the @xmath5 sector on the standard model physics .",
    "furthermore , we investigate what the structure of the model above the tev region can be .",
    "this includes the possibility of ( a part of ) the theory being conformal and/or supersymmetric .",
    "this affects collider signatures and cosmological implications of one of the colored hidden pions :  the one that does not decay through @xmath5 or standard model gauge dynamics .",
    "we also perform detailed analyses of cosmology of hidden baryons .",
    "we then discuss an extension of the minimal model which has an extra hidden quark that is singlet under the standard model gauge group .",
    "one of the salient features of this model is that there are two diphoton ( diboson ) resonances in the hidden pion sector , which can both be produced by gluon fusion and decay into two electroweak gauge bosons .",
    "we consider several scenarios associated with these and other related resonances .",
    "representative ones are :  ( i ) the two resonances correspond to two diphoton `` excesses '' seen in the atlas data at @xmath9 and @xmath16  @xcite ( although the latter is much weaker than the former ) ; ( ii ) the two resonances are both near @xmath17 with a mass difference of 10s of gev , explaining a slight preference to a wide width in the atlas data ; ( iii ) the two resonances are at @xmath9 and @xmath18 , responsible for the @xmath0 diphoton excess  @xcite and the @xmath19 diboson excess  @xcite , respectively .",
    "we calculate the masses of the hidden pions in the model and discuss their phenomenology .",
    "we find that the masses of the hidden pions can be larger than the case without the singlet hidden quark ; in particular , the leptoquark type hidden pion can be as heavy as @xmath20 , depending on scenarios .",
    "we discuss physics of hidden pions and hidden baryons that decay only through interactions beyond the @xmath5 and standard model gauge dynamics .",
    "we find that cosmological constraints on this model are weaker than those in the model without the extra hidden quark .",

    ", we consider the minimal model and its phenomenology at the tev scale .",
    "we calculate all the hidden pion masses and discuss their signatures and current constraints .",
    "we also discuss particles with higher masses , in particular the hidden @xmath21 meson and spin-1 resonances . in section  [ sec : higher - e ] , we study physics above the tev scale , especially its implications for collider physics and cosmology .",
    "the hidden pion that is stable under the @xmath5 and @xmath8 gauge dynamics as well as low - lying hidden baryons are studied in detail .",
    "we discuss the possibility that the @xmath5 sector is conformal and/or that the theory is supersymmetric above the tev scale . in section  [ sec:6-flavor ] , we study an extension of the model in which there is an extra hidden quark that is singlet under @xmath8 and has a mass smaller than @xmath22 .",

    "the existence of these particles , therefore , can be probed at the lhc in the near future .",

    "we have discussed possible theoretical structures above the tev scale , including conformal dynamics and supersymmetry , and their phenomenological implications .    in the extended version of the model , there is an additional hidden quark that is singlet under the standard model gauge group and has a mass smaller than the hidden dynamical scale .",
    "this yields two hidden pions that can be produced by gluon fusion and decay into standard model dibosons , including a diphoton .",
    "we have discussed several scenarios in which these and other resonances can be used to explain various excesses seen in the lhc data .",
    "the existence of the singlet hidden quark also helps to write operators inducing decays of would - be stable particles , such as @xmath116 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 hidden mesons and low - lying hidden baryons .",
    "in particular , if the theory becomes supersymmetric near the tev scale , the scale suppressing these higher dimensional operators can be as high as the unification scale @xmath123 while avoiding all the cosmological bounds .",
    "while we have presented it as that explaining the @xmath0 diphoton excess , the model discussed here may also be used to explain other diphoton / diboson excesses that might be seen in future data at the lhc or other future colliders .",
