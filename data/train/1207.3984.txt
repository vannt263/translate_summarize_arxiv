    "@xmath3  and related compounds have been much studied for half a century.@xcite their strongly temperature dependent magnetic and transport properties have been eluding complete theoretical description so far.@xcite an apparent band insulator below 50  k , @xmath3  exhibits a local moment magnetic response above 100  k while the charge gap continuously disappears between 450 and 600  k.@xcite this behavior points to an important role played by the electronic correlations as common among transition metal oxides .",
    "the correlated nature of @xmath3  reveals itself also in the formation of atomic - scale inhomogeneities with large magnetic moments upon moderate hole doping.@xcite the picture of thermal evolution of @xmath3  as an entropy driven crossover from a non - magnetic to a magnetic state of co@xmath4 ion has been generally accepted .",
    "however , the actual why s and how s are far from settled .",
    "the main open questions include the following .",
    "( i ) which atomic multiplet is responsible for the formation of local moments ?",
    "( ii ) does the lattice thermal expansion actively contribute to the spin - state transition or is it merely a slave to the changes of the electronic structure ?",
    "( iii ) why do the crossovers to local moment paramagnet and to bad metal happen at different temperatures ? in this work we use the combination of the density functional band structures with the dynamical mean - field theory , known as lda+dmft ,  @xcite to address the former two questions .",
    "we discuss in detail the attribution of local moment behavior to a particular atomic multiplet in systems with covalent bonds , a question of general importance in oxide physics .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility of @xmath3  is usually analyzed in terms of the lowest multiplets of an isolated co@xmath4 ion in octahedral crystal field:@xcite the low - spin ( ls ) @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) , the intermediate - spin ( is ) @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) , or the high - spin ( hs ) @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) states .",
    "the energy differences between the multiplets are controlled by the crystal - field ( cf ) splitting and the intra - atomic exchange @xmath11 .",
    "while the ls singlet ground state is undisputed ( at least for low temperature crystal structures ) the nature of the first excited state is still a subject of debate .",
    "goodenough  @xcite attributed the appearance of local moment to population of the hs state .",
    "et al . _ ,  @xcite on the other hand , proposed the is scenario , which became popular  @xcite after korotin _ et al . _",
    "@xcite obtained an is ground state for expanded lattice with lda+u calculation , contrary to a simple ligand - field theory .",
    "more recent experiments make a strong case for the hs scenario .",
    "the electron spin resonance shows a triplet excited state with a large @xmath12 factor of 3.353.55 which is consistently explained in the hs scenario invoking the effect of spin - orbit coupling.@xcite the x - ray absorption spectra ( xas ) and magnetic circular dichroism at the @xmath13 edge of co @xcite also select the hs scenario . however , several authors @xcite pointed out that in order to interpret the magnetic susceptibility , specific heat , or xas data in the hs scenario a rather strong temperature dependence of the crystal field has to be assumed . in other words ,",
    "the experimentally deduced increase of the hs population is significantly slower than anticipated with a fixed crystal field .",
    "the implication is that the apparent crystal field grows with temperature .",
    "this is somewhat unexpected since the expansion of the co - o bond which accompanies the spin crossover should reduce the crystal field . a possible explanation of this puzzling feature is provided by an interatomic repulsion between the hs states , which is equivalent to attraction between hs and ls states .",
    "@xcite breathing lattice distortion proposed by raccah and goodenough ,  @xcite studied in detail by bari and sivardire ,  @xcite provides a mechanism .",
    "@xcite used lda+u calculations to argue for hs - ls attraction .",
    "recently , a purely electronic mechanism of hs - ls attraction was observed by two of us @xcite in a two band hubbard model and by zhang _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite in @xmath3  specific calculation .",
    "it is well known that the effective crystal field in transition metal oxides is largely due to hybridization with ligands , i.e. ,  generated by hopping of predominantly @xmath14 electrons between the metal and oxygen sites .",
    "this effect is particularly pronounced in @xmath3and leads to charge fluctuations on the co site .",
    "therefore , it seems natural to question descriptions based on an isolated ion . how does one define and distinguish hs and is states when sizable charge ( valence ) fluctuations are present ? or , more",
    "precisely , is it possible to express the @xmath15-dependent susceptibility as a sum of contributions from different atomic states",
    "? we will show in sec .",
    "[ method_susceptibility ] that in a solid the answer is negative in general .",
    "however , in the insulating phase of @xmath3  the notion of ls , is , and hs states can be preserved when these are generalized to include the hybridization induced charge fluctuations .",
    "the @xmath15-_dependent _ paramagnetic moment can be to a good accuracy approximated by a @xmath15-_independent _ hs moment multiplied by a @xmath15-_dependent _ weight .",
    "importantly , the magnitude of this effective moment differs from the free ion value .",
    "the role of the lattice thermal expansion poses a chicken - and - egg question about the relationship between the spin - state transition and the anomalous lattice expansion .",
    "@xcite while the transition to the magnetic state , both is and hs , weakens the co - o bond and thus leads to its expansion , stretching the co - o bond reduces the effective cf splitting and thus favors a magnetic state .",
    "therefore , there is a positive feedback between these two effects . to include the lattice response directly into our calculations is not computationally feasible at the moment .",
    "therefore , we have performed calculations for several lattices corresponding to experimental crystal structures at different temperatures . by comparing the @xmath15 dependence of the spin susceptibilities on these lattices",
    "we find that experimentally observed variation of co - o bond lengths has a pronounced effect on the electronic properties .",
    "inclusion of thermal effects in  first principles \" density functional approaches is notoriously difficult .",
    "therefore , the existing studies are either limited to the @xmath16 ls phase  @xcite or assume that temperature enters only through the lattice thermal expansion .",
    "@xcite the only serious attempt to explicitly include temperature in such a calculation was made by eder  @xcite using the variational cluster approximation ( vca ) .",
    "the vca and dmft methods share many formal similarities , but involve different approximations .",
    "vca is , in principle , an exact method for calculation of one - particle properties , but , as pointed out in ref .",
    ", the relevance of multiplets populations obtained from a reference coo@xmath17 cluster is a conjecture , which calls for verification with other methods .",
    "dmft , on the other hand , treats one - particle and multiparticle correlations on the same footing , but becomes exact only in the limit of vanishing nonlocal correlations ( infinite dimension ) .",
    "recently , dmft was applied to @xmath3  to study the effect of varying interaction strength and pressure .",
    "multiband hubbard hamiltonian with the two - particle interaction within the co @xmath18 shell is used to describe @xmath3 .",
    "the one - particle part of the hamiltonian , which spans the co @xmath18 and o @xmath19 orbitals , has been constructed from the local density approximation ( lda ) to the density functional theory .",
    "the non - spin - polarized band structure obtained with wien2k  @xcite was transformed into the wannier basis representation with wien2wannier  @xcite and wannier90  @xcite codes .",
    "the hamiltonian in this representation reads @xmath20 here @xmath21 and @xmath22 are fourier transforms of the annihilation operators @xmath23 , @xmath24 which destroy the @xmath1 or @xmath0 electron with the orbital index @xmath25 or @xmath26 and the spin index @xmath27 in the @xmath28th unit cell , @xmath29 are the corresponding occupation number operators , and @xmath30 are the corresponding matrix elements of the one - particle lda hamiltonian .",
    "the @xmath31 are the density - density matrix elements in the @xmath14-@xmath32 basis of the full coulomb interaction  @xcite parametrized with @xmath33 ( slater parameter @xmath34 ) and hund s exchange @xmath11 [ connected with the slater parameters @xmath35 , @xmath36 as @xmath37 , @xmath38 .",
    "the screened values of @xmath39  ev and @xmath40  ev have been obtained using the constrained density functional theory ( cdft ) , described in detail in ref .  .",
    "to the dft potential an orbitally dependent term was added , which shifts by a small amount the energy of selected wannier functions ( wfs ) . due to this shift ,",
    "occupation of the wfs in question is changed and the coulomb interaction parameters are then determined as a derivative of the site energy with respect to the occupation .    in the following calculations",
    "are performed with cdft values of @xmath33 and @xmath11 .",
    "calculations , where @xmath33 and @xmath11 were varied , are also reported to assess the stability of the results .",
    "the @xmath41 diagonal elements were modified to account for the static part of the interaction , double - counting correction , @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the average self - consistent occupancy per co:@xmath1 orbital , @xmath44 is the orbital averaged interaction energy , and @xmath45 is the total number of interacting orbitals on a single site ( 10 in our case).@xcite this is equivalent to subtracting the orbitally averaged hartree potential felt by the @xmath1 electrons .",
    "the one - particle green s function of the hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonian ] ) is found by iteratively solving the dmft equations on the matsubara contour .",
    "the auxiliary impurity problem is solved by the continuous time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method in the hybridization expansion formulation  @xcite using the implementation based on free - access package alps .",
    "@xcite the wang - landau reweighting  @xcite was employed in order to ensure the ergodicity of the simulations for some parameter values , in particular at low temperatures and close to the spin state transition .",
    "once the calculation was converged we have evaluated the one - particle spectra in real frequency and analyzed the impurity dynamics and spin susceptibility . for the former analytic continuation",
    "is necessary . to this end",
    "we have employed the maximum entropy method in two modes : ( i ) continuation of the local green s function from the imaginary time @xmath46 to real frequency @xmath47 and ( ii ) continuation of the local self - energy from the matsubara frequency @xmath48 to @xmath47 . for the latter",
    "we have used the statistical error estimates following ref .  .",
    "the former was used to cross - check the results of ( ii ) and the spectra are not shown in the paper .",
    "analytic continuation of self - energy has several attractive features , such as being exact in the noninteracting limit , providing a direct access to the @xmath49-resolved and ligand spectra , and smearing out the lifetimes ( imaginary part of the self - energy ) but not the quasiparticle dispersions .      to analyze the on - site dynamics",
    "we have studied two additional quantities .",
    "first , the state weights @xcite which are the diagonal terms of the site - reduced density matrix , i.e. , expectation values of the projection operators on the atomic ( many - body ) states @xmath50 . in the present case of the density - density interaction",
    "the site - reduced density matrix is diagonal in the occupation number basis .",
    "therefore , the knowledge of the state weights allows us to evaluate the expectation value of any local operator , e.g. , the instantaneous local moment @xmath51 with @xmath52 .",
    "second , we define the imaginary time state - state correlation matrix @xmath53 and its time average @xmath54 , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the inverse temperature .",
    "the correlation matrix allows us to analyze the local response functions ( via fluctuation - dissipation theorem ) and decompose them into different contributions . in particular , we will be interested in the local spin susceptibility @xmath57 , which in the paramagnetic state can be expressed as @xmath58 the second expression shows that in general the local magnetic response can not be decomposed into contributions of atomic states , but pairs of states must be considered .",
    "decomposition into individual states contributions is possible only if @xmath53 can be made diagonal , e.g. , in an isolated atom .",
    "discussing briefly the physical meaning of these quantities we start by pointing out that in the course of time a given atom visits various quantum - mechanical states as a result of statistical ( thermal ) fluctuations and quantum - mechanical ( causal ) evolution .",
    "the weight of a given state is a relative measure of the time spent by the atom in this state , which does not distinguish between thermal fluctuations and causal evolution .",
    "the state - state correlations distinguish to some extent between these two effects as only states connected by causal evolution can have a nonzero cross term .",
    "the state weights can be obtained as row ( or column ) sums over @xmath54 .",
    "we have considered the experimental distorted perovskite structure with @xmath59 space group containing two formula units per unit cell .",
    "the structural parameters were taken from the x - ray measurements of ref .  .",
    "to assess the effect of lattice thermal expansion the calculations were repeated for the experimental structural parameters obtained at three different temperatures ( denoted as @xmath60 in the following ) : 5 , 450 , and 750  k.

    "the resulting orbitally resolved spectral density is shown in fig .",

    "the on - site contribution to the crystal field splitting @xmath63 ( left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig_spec_hyb ] ) is close to the value 0.7  ev extracted from the xas measurements .",
    "@xcite the @xmath0-@xmath1 hybridization increases the distance between the centers of @xmath32 and @xmath14 bands considerably .",
    "the band broadening , more pronounced for the @xmath14 band , is another consequence . matching o:@xmath0 and",
    "co:@xmath1 features reflect formation of bonding and antibonding states .",
    "stronger hybridization of the @xmath14 orbitals compared to @xmath32 ones results from their larger spatial overlap with o:@xmath0 orbitals .",
    "the @xmath32 band is further split to the @xmath64 doublet and the @xmath65 singlet due to a distortion from the octahedral symmetry .",
    "this splitting does not play an important role in our study , though . as in previous calculations a metallic ground state",
    "is incorrectly predicted by lda .",

    "[ fig_chi_mtm](b ) . as we calculate directly the local susceptibility ( the local response to a field applied to a single site of the infinite crystal ) the intersite exchange does not enter the definition of the local moment .",

    "the increase of @xmath78 by a factor of 35 over the spin - state crossover was deduced from xas  @xcite and measurements of the magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity .",
    "@xcite    it is quite clear that our results do not provide an accurate quantitative description of @xmath3  as the spin crossover takes place at a too high temperature .",
    "this is not surprising since the present theory is unlikely to achieve the necessary @xmath7910  mev accuracy without fine - tuning the material parameters by hand .",
    "the approximations of the model ( such as the restriction to the density - density coulomb interaction and neglect of the long - range or @xmath0-@xmath1 interactions ) limits the accuracy further .",
    "however , two important trends are revealed .",
    "first , the lattice response ( expansion of o@xmath17 octahedra around moment - carrying sites ) acts as a positive feedback for generation of local moments .",
    "second , this is countered by a purely electronic effect , making addition of a local moment the harder the more local moments are already in the system ; this is reflected in the increase of @xmath68 with the temperature [ fig .",
    "[ fig_chi_mtm](c ) ] .",
    "this is another way of saying that there is a repulsive interaction between the magnetic sites in the ls background .",
    "we point out that in our calculation all o@xmath17 octahedra are the same , which excludes a possible contribution of the breathing distortion .",
    "@xcite indeed , kymen _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite substituting co with al , ga , and rh came to the conclusion that electronegativity rather than ionic radius of the neighbors is the parameter which controls @xmath68 .",
    "we suggest the following picture based on the observation that a strong co:@xmath14-o bond favors ls state , and that in the co - o - co trimer the co - o bonds share the central @xmath80 orbital . due to this sharing the energy gain per co -",
    "o bond in the trimer is less than the energy gain for an isolated co - o bond .",
    "therefore , breaking ( weakening ) one bond in the trimer makes the other bond stronger .",
    "introducing a local moment on one co site provides this bond breaking and strengthening the other bond favors the ls state .",
