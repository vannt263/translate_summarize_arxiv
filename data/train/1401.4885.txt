    "our main result in this connection asserts that , however , an inequality in the spirit of still holds if , on the leftmost side , an orlicz norm appears which , in general , has to be slightly weaker than that on the rightmost side .",
    "a precise balance between the relevant norms for a conclusion of this kind to hold is the content of theorem [ thm:3.2 ] , section [ main ] .",

    "if nonlinearities of non - polynomial type are allowed , such as in the eyring - prandtl model @xcite , the more flexible orlicz and orlicz - sobolev spaces have to be called into play .",

    "+ the aim of this paper is the extension of the negative norm concept to general orlicz spaces and relation between a young function and a its distributional gradient . without the @xmath71 and @xmath72-condition we can not expect that it can be described by meanings of the same orlicz space",

    "next , the pressure has be to reconstructed .",
    "precisely , one has to find @xmath683 such that @xmath684 this is the discrete analogone of the problem from theorem [ thm:4.1 ] .",
    "as far as existence is concerned , we only need to solve an algebraic linear system .",
    "the following questions then arise :          the answer to all this questions follows from the so - called inf - sup condition .",
    "such a condition , in the standard case when @xmath41 has a power type growth as in , reads as @xmath688 for some positive constant @xmath104 independent of @xmath642 .",
    "in fact , the uniqueness of @xmath685 does not even require @xmath104 to be independent of @xmath642 .",
    "[ thm:4.2 ] let @xmath29 and @xmath76 be young functions fulfilling and .",
    "assume that @xmath0 is a polyhedron in @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and that @xmath657 and @xmath658 are such that there exists an operator @xmath689 satisfying ( [ itm : a1 - 2])-([itm : a2 ] ) .",
    "then , @xmath690 for some positive constant @xmath254 , where @xmath184 is the constant appearing in and    * proof*. as a first step , we show that the operator @xmath656 is continuous in every orlicz space , in the sense that there exists a constant @xmath396 such that , for every young function @xmath29 , @xmath691 inequality has been established in ( * ? ? ?",

    "a variant of those proofs shows that , in fact , this assumption can be dropped .",
    "we outline the argument hereafter .",
    "since @xmath692 belongs to a finite dimensional function space , it follows from ( [ itm : a2 ] ) that @xmath693 for some constants @xmath396 and @xmath694 , and for every @xmath695 .",

    "hence , follows .    since the functions @xmath714 belong to finite dimensional spaces it would be possible to replace @xmath715 in theorem [ thm:4.2 ] by @xmath716 .",
    "however , the constant then depends on the dimension of @xmath717 and hence on @xmath642 . in that form ,",
