    "rn black hole solutions exist only for horizon radius @xmath132 , and the extremal rn solution has @xmath133 .",

    "like the neutral non - abelian spherically symmetric solutions of @xmath0 eym theory , the charged solutions are classified by the node numbers @xmath139 of their ( non - vanishing ) gauge field functions @xmath97 .",
    "when the node numbers of one or more gauge field functions tend to infinity , the solutions approach limiting solutions with higher norm of the charge .    in table  2",

    "their limiting solutions are the rn solutions with csa charge of norm @xmath144 ( 1a ) , @xmath145 ( 2a,2b ) , @xmath146 ( 3a ) and @xmath147 ( 3b ) , for @xmath78 .",
    "the generalization to all other cases is straightforward .",
    "for instance , for the case 2a the limiting solution for a sequence @xmath148 , @xmath149 , is a non - abelian solution with the same norm of the csa charge , @xmath145 .    as illustrated in fig .  1 , with increasing @xmath7 the mass @xmath150 converges exponentially to the mass @xmath151 of the corresponding limiting solution .",
    "the pattern of convergence of the charged solutions is completely analogous to the pattern of convergence of the neutral solutions as observed previously @xcite , with the extremal charged solutions playing the role of the globally regular neutral solutions .",
    "the extremal solutions fall on straight lines , whereas the non - extremal black hole solutions fall on straight lines only beyond some critical @xmath7 , for which the horizon radius is getting close to the innermost node of the gauge field function with @xmath7 nodes , @xmath152 .",
    "the slopes are determined by the particular type of sequence .",
    "interestingly , we observe that the slopes of the extremal @xmath6 solutions ( 1a,2b ) agree with the slope of the globally regular @xmath6 solutions , and that their innermost nodes converge with the same exponent towards a limiting value , slightly smaller than the norm of the charge of the limiting solution @xcite .    in figs .",
    "2a - c we present the lowest odd solutions of case 3a for the sequence @xmath142 and extremal horizon @xmath153 , also in the interior of the black hole ( for @xmath154 ) . figs .",
    "2a - b show the functions @xmath155 , @xmath156 and @xmath157 , and fig .",
    "2c shows the charge function @xmath158 , @xmath159 @xcite .",
    "the charge functions @xmath160 of this sequence of solutions with csa charge of norm @xmath161 clearly illustrate that the limiting solution carries a csa charge which has the higher norm @xmath162 .",
    "let us end by considering @xmath0 einstein - yang - mills - dilaton ( eymd ) theory .",
    "analogously to eym theory , in @xmath6 and @xmath12 eymd theory sequences of neutral globally regular and black hole solutions exist @xcite .",
    "the neutral @xmath6 eymd black hole solutions converge to magnetically charged einstein - maxwell - dilaton ( emd ) black hole solutions @xcite , and the neutral @xmath12 eymd solutions converge to limiting magnetically charged solutions , in which again one of the two @xmath12 gauge field functions is identically zero @xcite . in general",
    ", the @xmath0 eym classification remains valid for @xmath0 eymd theory .",
