    "the discovery of superconductivity in @xmath4 and the fact that the carbides and the nitrides of @xmath5 show superconductivity have renewed interest in finding superconductivity in the borides of @xmath5 , in particular , the diborides . however , the search for superconductivity in @xmath6 and @xmath6-based alloys is not new . earlier work by zeigler @xmath7 @xcite and hulm @xmath7 @xcite showed @xmath8 deficient @xmath6 , namely @xmath9 to be superconducting with superconducting transition temperature , @xmath0 , of around @xmath10 , while schriber @xmath7 @xcite found @xmath11 ( synthesized under pressure ) with @xmath12 to be superconducting with @xmath0 of @xmath13 .",
    "recently , yamamoto @xmath7 @xcite and kotegawa @xmath7 @xcite have reported superconductivity in @xmath1 alloys when synthesized under pressure for @xmath2 ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath15 .",
    "they find that @xmath1 samples become superconducting for @xmath16 , and the @xmath17 increases to around @xmath13 for @xmath18 , thereafter @xmath0 remains essentially unchanged up to @xmath19 .    in an effort to theoretically understand the changes in the electronic structure of @xmath1 and @xmath9 alloys and their superconducting properties as vacancies",
    "are introduced either in the @xmath5 plane or the @xmath8 plane , we have carried out first - principles electronic structure calculations of these alloys as a function of vacancy concentration . we have used korringa - kohn - rostoker coherent - potential approximation @xcite in the atomic - sphere approximation ( kkr - asa cpa ) method for taking into account the effects of disorder , gaspari - gyorffy formalism @xcite for calculating the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath20 , and allen - dynes equation @xcite for calculating @xmath0 in @xmath1 and @xmath9 alloys .    here , we like to point out that the recent theoretical work of shein @xmath21 @xmath22 @xcite to model disordered @xmath23 alloy using a 12-atom supercell may not be adequate .",
    "this can be seen as follows .",
    "each metal atom in @xmath24-type diborides has @xmath25 symmetry and thus has 12 @xmath8 neighbors at the vertices of a hexagonal prism .",
    "in addition , the central metal atom also sees @xmath26 others through the faces of the @xmath27 prism at a distance comparable with the metallic diameter .",
    "thus a minimum of @xmath28-atom supercell would have been more appropriate .",
    "however , their conclusion that the superconductivity in @xmath1 alloys is governed more by the changes that take place in the lattice properties when vacancies are introduced in the metal plane of the diborides , is consistent with our results . before describing our results ,",
    "we provide some of the computational details of the present approach .",
    "the charge self - consistent electronic structure of @xmath1 and @xmath29 alloys has been calculated using the kkr - asa cpa method with @xmath2 ranging from @xmath14 to @xmath30 the lattice constants for @xmath1 alloys are taken from the experimental work of yamamoto @xmath7@xcite . to determine the electronic structure of @xmath6 using the present approach , we have used the lattice constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 from our earlier full - potential linear muffin - tin orbital calculations@xcite .",
    "the absence of @xmath5 and @xmath8 atoms in the @xmath5 and @xmath8 planes , respectively , were modelled by introducing empty spheres at those sites .",
    "the disorder was accounted for by the coherent - potential approximation @xcite , which has been very successful in describing reliably many physical properties of disordered alloys @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation potential was parametrized as suggested by perdew - wang within the generalized gradient approximation @xcite .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration was carried out with @xmath33 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the bz . for densities of states ( dos ) calculations",
    ", we added a small imaginary component of @xmath34 @xmath35 to the energy and used @xmath36 * k*-points in the irreducible part of the bz .",
    "for valence states the angular momentum cut - off was kept as @xmath37 , and the core states were recalculated . for @xmath5 and @xmath8 the ratio of the atomic sphere radius to the wigner - seitz radius was kept fixed at 1.294 and 0.747 , respectively .",
    "the empty spheres inherited the radii of the corresponding atomic spheres .",
    "the present calculations were carried out using the scalar - relativistic schroedinger equation .",
    "the green s function is calculated in a complex plane with a @xmath38 point gaussian quadrature .",
    "the superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 was calculated with the allen - dynes equation ,    @xmath39.\\label{tc}\\ ] ]    in our calculation , the value of the phonon frequency @xmath40 for @xmath6 was taken from ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath41 was set equal to 0.09 , and the electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath20 was calculated using the gaspari - gyorffy formalism with the charge self - consistent potentials of @xmath1 and @xmath29 alloys obtained with the kkr - asa cpa method .",
    "this entails writing @xmath20 in terms of hopfield parameter , @xmath42 , as    @xmath43    where the sum is over the basis atoms in the primitive cell , @xmath44 is the atomic mass and @xmath45 is an average phonon frequency .",
    "the average phonon frequency @xmath45 is taken to be the root - mean- square frequency @xmath46 . in the gaspari - gyorffy formalism",
    "the spherically averaged hopfield parameter is given by    @xmath47    the total dos at the fermi energy @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and the @xmath50resolved dos , @xmath51 as well as the electron - phonon matrix elements ,    @xmath52\\label{mllp}\\ ] ]    are calculated from the charge self - consistent potentials obtained with the kkr - asa cpa method . in eq .",

    "in the following we describe the results of our calculations for @xmath6 and its alloys in terms of ( i ) the densities of states , ( ii ) the electron - phonon coupling and ( iii ) the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "we first describe how the densities of states , the electron - phonon coupling and the superconducting transition temperature change for low concentrations of vacancies in either the @xmath5 or the @xmath8 plane .",
    "then , we describe the changes in these properties as a function of increasing vacancy concentration .        in fig .",
    "1 we show the calculated total dos and the partial dos together with the @xmath59-resolved partial dos of @xmath6 .",
    "the overall structure of the dos is consistent with the previous work@xcite .",

    ", are @xmath74 a low lying broad peak around @xmath75 ry below @xmath48 due to @xmath8 @xmath76 and @xmath77states , @xmath78 another broad peak at around @xmath79 ry comprising of @xmath80 , @xmath81 and @xmath77 states , @xmath82 a relatively constant dos from @xmath83 ry primarily of @xmath80 and @xmath77 states , and @xmath84 a pseudo - gap at @xmath85 ry , which appears in many transition - metal diborides @xcite .",
    "thus the dominant presence of @xmath77 states at @xmath48 in @xmath6 makes it quite different from @xmath4 which has largely @xmath8 @xmath86states at @xmath48 .",

    "2 , we show the calculated @xmath59-resolved partial dos at the empty sphere site in @xmath89 . it is seen that upon @xmath34% creation of vacancy in the @xmath5 plane , the total dos at @xmath48 for @xmath89 is reduced by @xmath90@xmath91% relative to that of @xmath6 .",
