    "<S> the 3d crystal can be viewed as a stack of bilayer square lattices in the @xmath7 plane . </S>",
    "<S> we now introduce a tight - binding model to describe the band structure of electron s @xmath8 orbitals ( or @xmath9 orbitals , see the next paragraph ) . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we are interested in the energy bands derived from @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that these bands do not overlap with the @xmath12 bands , and construct a tight - binding model from wannier functions with the same symmetry as @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbitals . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath22 label the @xmath23 orbital . </S>",

    "<S> we introduce a pseudospin @xmath44 to label the @xmath10 and @xmath11 orbital of the doublet . in this basis , @xmath1 rotation is represented by @xmath45 and time reversal operator @xmath0 is represented by complex conjugation . up to a gauge transformation </S>",
    "<S> , the form of the @xmath43 hamiltonian @xmath46 is dictated by symmetry:@xmath47 perturbations which break either @xmath1 or @xmath0 symmetry can open up an energy gap and destroy the protected surface states . </S>",

    "<S> our tight - binding model does not have gapless surface states for other surface terminations which break the @xmath1 symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath0 and @xmath1 symmetry are preserved , the surface states shown above are _ topologically _ protected . </S>",
    "<S> this can be understood by considering the surface band dispersion along @xmath50 . within our model , surface states ( if present ) </S>",
    "<S> must be doubly degenerate at @xmath51 and @xmath42 . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> there exists two distinct types of surface band connectivity along @xmath50 , having an even or odd number of band crossings at fermi energy respectively . </S>",
    "<S> surface states with even crossings are fragile : they can be pushed out of the energy gap by changing the surface potential . </S>",
    "<S> surface states with odd crossings have a fermi surface which encloses @xmath51 an odd number of times . </S>",
    "<S> they can not be removed . </S>",
    "<S> these two types of surface states imply the existence of two topologically distinct phases of time - reversal - invariant band insulators with four - fold symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the reasoning here closely follows the previous study of topological insulators@xcite .    * </S>",
    "<S> @xmath3 topological invariant * : we now show that a @xmath3 topological invariant @xmath52 characterizes the band structure of 3d time - reversal - invariant insulators with four - fold rotation symmetry ( without spin - orbit coupling ) . </S>",

    "<S> time reversal symmetry by itself does not guarantee a two - fold degeneracy . </S>",
    "<S> however , the combination of time reversal and four - fold rotational symmetry can lead to protected degeneracies at four special momenta @xmath65 in the 3d brillouin zone ( fig.1b ) . </S>",
    "<S> at such a high symmetry point @xmath66 , @xmath67 commutes with @xmath68 , so that the energy bands @xmath69 are eigenstates of four - fold rotation with possible eigenvalues @xmath70 and @xmath71 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath86 stands for the pfaffian . </S>",
    "<S> we now specify the integration path in ( [ it ] ) . for @xmath87 , </S>",
    "<S> the integral is along an arbitrary line connecting @xmath88 and @xmath89 which lies _ within _ the 2d plane @xmath90 in the brillouin zone as shown in fig.1b . </S>",
    "<S> likewise , the integration path for @xmath91 lies in the plane @xmath92 .    both @xmath93 and @xmath94 </S>",
    "<S> depend on the choice of basis @xmath95 , but we now prove that @xmath96 is gauge invariant . </S>",
    "<S> two different basis @xmath97 and @xmath98 are related by a @xmath99 gauge transformation : latexmath:[\\ ] ] using the identity @xmath102=\\det[x ] { \\rm pf}[m]$ ] , it is straightforward to verify that @xmath103 is gauge invariant .    </S>",
    "<S> we now further show that @xmath104 is a @xmath3 quantity . </S>",
    "<S> it follows from ( [ t ] ) that at the two 2d planes @xmath90 and @xmath92 , @xmath105 has the symmetry property : @xmath106 this allows us to choose a _ real _ gauge along the integration path to evaluate ( [ it ] ) : @xmath107 because @xmath108 is anti - unitary , @xmath109 everywhere along the integration path . </S>",
    "<S> so in this gauge @xmath110}$ ] reduces to @xmath111/{\\rm pf } [ w({{\\bf k}}_1 ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> \\ ] ] because @xmath112 belong to the two - dimensional representation of @xmath1 group , we have @xmath113 , so that the gauge condition ( [ gauge ] ) at @xmath66 is equivalent to @xmath114 , i.e. , the wavefunction is real . under this reality condition , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix @xmath115 simplifies to @xmath116 now by choosing a particular kind of real basis @xmath117 , @xmath115 reduces to a standard form @xmath118 , which is a direct sum of @xmath119 @xmath120 levi - civita tensors . </S>",
    "<S> this means that in a generic real basis , @xmath115 can be written as @xmath121 so we have @xmath122 = \\det[o({{\\bf k}}_i ) ] { \\rm pf } [ w^0 ] = \\det[o({{\\bf k}}_i ) ] = \\pm 1 .   \\ ] ] this proves that @xmath123 is a gauge invariant @xmath3 quantity . </S>",
    "<S> so both @xmath87 and @xmath91 are @xmath3 topological invariants which characterize the band structures in the 2d momentum space @xmath90 and @xmath92 respectively . </S>",
    "<S> their product @xmath124 is defined for 3d time - reversal - invariant insulators with @xmath1 symmetry , and determines the surface state property : gapless surface states exist on ( 001 ) face only when @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> this is verified in the tight - binding model ( [ h ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between @xmath124 and @xmath125 is analogous to that of strong and weak @xmath3 index in 3d topological insulators@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> * generalization to crystals with @xmath2 symmetry * : the study of topological crystalline insulators with @xmath1 symmetry can be generalized to hexagonal crystal structures with @xmath2 symmetry . in that case , ( 001 ) surface states have quadratic degeneracy points either at @xmath51 or two equivalent @xmath126 . </S>",
    "<S> the topological invariant is similarly defined by eq.([it ] ) from the electron wavefunctions on the lines @xmath127 and @xmath128 in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> a concrete tight - binding model can be obtained by placing ( [ h ] ) in a layered triangular lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the details will be reported elsewhere .    </S>",
    "<S> the fact that the above @xmath3 invariant is only defined for doublet bands illustrates the important interplay between symmetry representation and topology of energy bands in solids , a feature absent in other known classes of topological insulators . </S>",
    "<S> we are not aware of a systematic mathematical approach to classifying vector bundles ( e.g. , electron wavefunctions over the brillouin zone ) with given representations of group action ( e.g. , @xmath1 rotation ) at fixed points ( e.g. high symmetry momenta @xmath66 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we hope the concrete topological invariant ( [ it ] ) can stimulate continuing research on topological crystalline insulators with other lattice structures .    </S>",
    "<S> the occupied bands of real materials usually have both doubly degenerate and nondegenerate singlet components . provided that the doublet bands are energetically separable from the singlet ones ( i.e. , no band crossing between them ) , the @xmath3 invariant remains well - defined for the former . </S>",
    "<S> the coexistence with singlet bands can in principle weaken the stability of surface states ( see supplementary material ) , although this senario seems unlikely to happen in reality .    </S>",
    "<S> * surface states with quadratic degeneracy * : quadratic degeneracies in 2d band structure have attracted considerable interest recently . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath43 hamiltonian ( [ heff ] ) is widely used as a low energy approximation for the band structure of bilayer graphene near @xmath129 points . </S>",
    "<S> however , unlike topological crystalline insulators , the quadratic degeneracy there is _ not _ protected by symmetry . instead , the band dispersion very close to @xmath129 becomes linear due to trigonal warping effects .    </S>",
    "<S> electron interactions can drive 2d bands with quadratic degeneracy into a variety of interesting broken symmetry phases including quantum anomalous hall state , nematic phase and etc@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between different ordered phases is of great interest in bilayer graphene . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to see what happens in the _ single - valley _ </S>",
    "<S> quadratic surface states of topological crystalline insulators </S>",
    "<S> .    it would be interesting to generalize the concept of topological crystalline insulators to interacting systems . for example </S>",
    "<S> , crystal symmetry is known to play an important role in the topological classification of spin liquids@xcite , spin chains@xcite , and mott insulators@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a unifying theory of symmetry protected topological phases remains to be developed . </S>",
