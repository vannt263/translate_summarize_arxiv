    "one of the open problems of high - temperature superconducting cuprates is the role played by the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "the experimental evidences suggest a fairly strong influence of the electron - phonon interaction on some physical properties , while for some other aspects , lattice effects seem to have almost no role .",
    "on one side , inelastic scattering measurements have shown that a specific optical in - plane phonon mode displays an anomalously pronounced softening.@xcite the coupling to the same phonon mode has been invoked to explain the kink in the nodal electron dispersion detected by photoemission,@xcite on the other hand , the almost perfectly linear behavior of the resistivity in a wide range of temperatures seems to indicate a little influence of phonons on transport properties .",
    "isotope effects also show a complex phenomenology : while the the superconducting temperature has a little isotope effect at optimal doping,@xcite the in - plane penetration depth is much more sensitive to isotope substitution.@xcite such a large ( around 5% ) effect is usually translated into an isotope effect on the effective mass suggesting the presence of polaronic carriers in underdoped compounds.@xcite    the above puzzling scenario leads to a lively debate which ultimately focuses on whether the effects of electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling on different quantities are depressed or enhanced by the presence of strong correlations .",
    "given the intrinsic nonperturbative character of the problem , there is no obvious theoretical approach .",
    "different approaches seem indeed to draw conflicting scenarios in studies of the holstein model for the e - ph coupling in the presence of strong correlations , described by the hubbard or the @xmath0-@xmath1 models . according to quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and exact diagonalization ( ed ) a single hole in the @xmath0-@xmath1 model experiences an enhanced polaronic effect due to",
    "the `` pre - localizing '' mechanism associated to the antiferromagnetic spin background.@xcite qmc calculations in the hubbard model at finite density and fairly high temperature suggest that strong correlations favor the small transfered momentum electron - phonon vertex ( or depress it less than its large momentum counterpart ) , and that this quantity increases by increasing repulsion for a window of parameters.@xcite slave boson approaches suggest however that such an effect is just a finite - temperature precursor of a phase separation that would take place at low temperatures.@xcite such tendency towards phase separation , indicated by mean - field approaches also for the three - band hubbard model,@xcite has been recently confirmed by the more accurate dynamical mean field theory ( dmft).@xcite    another piece of information comes from the dmft of the half - filled hubbard - holstein model in the paramagnetic sector ( i.e. , neglecting the antiferromagnetic ordering ) , where detailed phase diagrams are available.@xcite in ref .",
    "we have shown that , close to the mott transition , phonons have different effects on high- and low - energy single particle properties ( self - energy , spectral weights , density of states ,  ) .",
    "namely , high - energy features are significantly affected by phonons , whereas the low - energy quasiparticle features are basically untouched and they coincide with those of an effective purely electronic with a slightly weaker repulsion @xmath2 . in other words ,",
    "the strong correlations strongly reduce the impact of e - ph interaction on quasiparticle properties , at least when the e - ph coupling is not too large .",
    "the only residual effect is a phonon - induced screening of @xmath2 which moreover is found to vanish linearly with the phonon frequency in the adiabatic limit .",
    "this variety of results is certainly due to the different physical regimes they refer to . in this work",
    "we start from our analysis of the half - filled hubbard - holstein model and relax the half - filling condition , therefore putting ourselves away from the mott transition , in a regime closer to that of other approaches .",
    "we find that strong correlations still significantly harm the e - ph interaction . in our strongly correlated metal polaronic behavior only establishes for e - ph coupling larger by at least a factor two than the corresponding values in the absence of strong correlations or for a single hole in an antiferromagnetic background .",
    "moreover , we find that the interplay of electron - electron and e - ph interaction makes the value of the phonon frequency quite relevant , particularly for its effect on the effective mass .",
    "remarkably , phonon dynamics turns out to be more relevant close to half - filling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] we compare the half - filled and finite doping cases of the hubbard - holstein model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : zeta ] we analyze the renormalization of the quasiparticle weight as a function of the electron - phonon coupling and the phonon frequency . in sec .",
    "[ sec : screening ] the behavior of the chemical potential is studied and the conclusions are then drawn in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "the hamiltonian of the hubbard - holstein model reads @xmath3 where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) are , respectively , destruction ( creation ) operators for fermions with spin @xmath8 and for local vibrations of frequency @xmath9 on site @xmath10 , @xmath0 is the hopping amplitude , @xmath2 is the local hubbard repulsion and @xmath11 is an electron - phonon coupling constant . in this work",
    "we will always consider an infinite coordination bethe - lattice with semicircular density of states of semibandwidth @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the standard electron - phonon coupling and @xmath14 is the adiabatic ratio .",
    "we solve the model by means of dynamical mean - field theory ( dmft ) , which in recent years has emerged as one of the most reliable tools for the analysis of both correlated materials and electron - phonon interactions .",
    "the method maps the lattice model onto an effective local theory which still retains full quantum dynamics , and it is therefore expected to be quite accurate for models with local interactions as ( [ hamiltonian ] ) .",
    "the mean - field correspondence between the local theory and the original model is achieved by imposing a self - consistency condition which contains the information about the original lattice.@xcite in practice , the local problem is described through an anderson - holstein impurity model,@xcite whose impurity green s function has to be calculated and used to generate a new impurity model through the self - consistency equation . to solve the impurity model we use ed,@xcite truncating the infinite phonon hilbert space allowing up to @xmath15 phonon states ( ranging from @xmath16 to @xmath17 ) , and using up to @xmath18 sites in the conduction",
    "bath.@xcite    dmft has been widely use to study the properties of the hubbard model , and a clear framework for the mott - hubbard transition has been determined . without entering the details of these studies ,",
    "we just recall the qualitative difference between the half - filled system , where a metal - insulator occurs at @xmath19 , and finite - doping systems that have metallic character regardless the value of @xmath2 .",
    "such a distinction makes the effects of phonons different in the two cases .    at",
    "half - filling , in the strongly correlated metallic phase for @xmath2 smaller , but not far from @xmath20 , the hubbard model presents a clear separation of energy scales , with high - energy hubbard bands well separated from the low - energy quasiparticle peak . in this regime",
    "the charge fluctuations are frozen , therefore strongly harming the e - ph interaction , at least with a holstein coupling . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the residual effect of phonons can be described as a partial screening of the static hubbard repulsion , which is ruled by the parameter @xmath21 , according to the expression @xmath22 , with @xmath23 given by @xmath24 notice that the above expression for @xmath25 correctly reproduces the antiadiabatic limit @xmath26 , where the e - ph interaction mediates an instantaneous local attraction of strength @xmath27 .",
    "the description in terms of an effective hubbard model with a suitably rescaled repulsion @xmath25 works surprisingly well in the proximity of the mott transition : the full hubbard - holstein model and the effective purely electronic model display an identical electronic spectrum at low energy and , quite remarkably , the same rescaling for @xmath25 makes the position of the hubbard bands basically coincide .",
    "the effects of the electron - phonon coupling close to the mott transition are well visible in the high - energy parts of the electronic spectrum , where phonon satellites show up , while the low - energy metallic peak turns out to be `` protected '' by correlation .",
    "this paper is devoted to the extension of this analysis to generic fillings , still limiting ourselves to the paramagnetic sector .",
    "conceptually the peculiarity of half - filling is the clear separation between high- and low - energy scales , which is rapidly lost as the density deviates from one .",
    "this lack of hierarchy of energy scales makes it more complicated to draw a simple physical picture such as the one described above . on the other hand ,",
    "the properties of the metallic phase at finite doping are not severely affected by the antiferromagnetic order , which , if included , would instead change considerably the half - filling picture .",
    "as in ref . , we start our analysis from the inspection of the quasiparticle weight @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the real part of the local self - energy @xmath30 . due to the momentum independence of the self - energy in dmft , @xmath31 is also inversely proportional to the quasiparticle effective mass ratio @xmath32 .",
    "it is therefore clear that this quantity measures the metallic nature of the system , small values of @xmath31 implying poorly metallic situations .      at half - filling , in the correlated metal for @xmath33 ,",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xmath31 _ increases _ with the electron - phonon coupling @xmath27.@xcite this counterintuitive behavior , in stark contrast with weakly correlated systems , where @xmath31 decreases with @xmath27 , is understood in terms of a phonon - driven attraction which counteracts the hubbard repulsion , and it can be quantitatively described within the effective picture introduced in sec . [",
    "sec : model]:@xcite by increasing @xmath27 , the effective repulsion decreases , thus the system becomes less correlated , and the value of @xmath31 increases .",
    "as mentioned above , such a reduced effectiveness of the e - ph coupling can be associated to the freezing of charge fluctuations , to which the phonons are coupled .",
    "close to mott state , most sites are singly occupied , and doubly occupied and empty sites are a minority .",
    "as soon as we move away from half - filling , doping , e.g. , with holes , the number of empty sites proliferates . therefore charge fluctuations are gradually restored , even if they are still reduced with respect to a system without electron correlations .     as a function of @xmath27 for various values of the density .",
    "in both cases of @xmath34 ( left ) and @xmath35 ( right ) the phonon frequency @xmath9 has been fixed to @xmath36.,width=302,height=264 ]    as a consequence , one can expect a stronger electron - phonon signature with respect to half - filling .",
    "the behavior of @xmath31 rapidly becomes more ordinary , namely @xmath31 decreases as a function of @xmath27 ( except , as we will see below , for extremely large @xmath9 of the order of @xmath2 ) meaning that the predominant effect of the coupling to the lattice is of localizing nature .",
    "this is also consistent with a much weaker dependence of @xmath31 on @xmath2 for @xmath37 ( in comparison with the case @xmath38 at half - filling ) which would depress the delocalizing effect of any phonon - induced variation of @xmath2 into @xmath25 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : u5vsu0 ] we plot @xmath32 as a function of @xmath27 for different doping levels and for @xmath39 .",
    "in the left panel we show the uncorrelated system ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "@xmath32 is equal to @xmath40 for @xmath41 , it rapidly increases with @xmath27 , eventually reaching a polaronic regime , testified by an exponential growth of the effective mass and by the development of finite lattice distortions coupled to the electrons.@xcite the right - hand panel presents instead a strongly correlated case(@xmath35 ) . here",
    "the value of @xmath32 at @xmath41 is strongly dependent on density , since correlations are more and more effective in localizing the carriers the closer we are to half - filling . in practice @xmath42 already for @xmath43 and it reaches more than 10 for @xmath44 .",
    "the main result is however that the e - ph interaction is not able to substantially modify this values determined by correlation , up to @xmath45-@xmath46 and @xmath32 is almost flat in this interval , if compared with the left panel .",
    "thus , even if doped system do not show the growth of @xmath31 with @xmath27 characteristic of half - filling ( close to @xmath20 ) , the effect of e - ph coupling is anyway quantitatively reduced by a sizable amount .",
    "a similar information is brought by the location of the polaron crossover :     ( main panel ) in the crossover from weak to strong @xmath27 for @xmath35 , @xmath47 and @xmath39 . in the two insets the phonon distribution function @xmath48 in the polaron region",

    "[ fig : u5vsu0 ] , the e - ph interaction finally becomes able to sizably affect the quasiparticle residue @xmath31 . in the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta_pol ] ( @xmath35 , @xmath44 , @xmath54 ) , the curve of @xmath31 as a function of @xmath27 clearly displays a crossover between a small-@xmath27 linear behavior and a much faster decrease for @xmath55 .",
    "this is precisely the signature of a polaron crossover , as shown by many studies for the pure holstein model , where a similar bending of the curve occurs for much smaller @xmath56.@xcite    an alternative marker of the polaron crossover is the phonon displacement distribution @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is the groundstate vector , and @xmath59 is the projection operator on the subspace where the phonon displacement value @xmath60 ( @xmath61 being the phonon mass ) has a given value @xmath62 .",
    "this quantity therefore measures the distribution of the local distortions . at weak coupling",
    ", @xmath48 has only one peak , which only broadens when the coupling increases , but when a polaronic groundstate is realized , it presents two peaks , corresponding to different distortions associated to the different charge states.@xcite the two insets of fig .",
    "[ fig : zeta_pol ] show @xmath48 for two sets of parameter chosen in order to highlight the different way to realize the bimodality in the uncorrelated system ( left / larger panel ) and in the strongly correlated one ( right / small panel ) .",
    "the simple @xmath48 , shown as a shaded area , does not allow us to distinguish the two situations .",
    "therefore we also plot the conditioned probability distributions projected onto the states in which the impurity has different occupations @xmath63.@xcite for @xmath34 the bimodality is associated to a large number of empty and doubly occupied sites ( that gain more e - ph energy ) , and a smaller number of singly occupied ones .",
    "this is a signature of bipolaronic groundstate , where pairs of polarons are formed .",
    "since we are at finite doping the two distributions have different shapes and heights . for @xmath35 the two peaks of @xmath48 are instead associated to empty sites and singly occupied ones , since the strong on - site repulsion unfavors double occupancies .",
    "exploiting the empty sites , the system can acquire polaronic groundstate at intermediate values of @xmath27 , while at half - filling this would require to completely overcome the hubbard @xmath2 .",
    "we finally notice that in the special half - filling case @xmath48 is not the ideal quantity to identify the polaronic behavior , which , at intermediate values of @xmath27 , can only appear in the dynamics of the excitations ( e.g. the behavior of a single hole )    to summarize the results of this section , we can conclude that for metallic situations with finite doping it is not possible to describe the effects of the phonons on quasiparticle properties in terms of an effective screened coulomb repulsion , as it happened at half - filling .",
    "it is anyway still true that the effect of phonons on quasiparticle properties is substantially weaker than for weakly correlated systems , and that the phonon effects can be strong only in the high - energy part of the spectra.@xcite the polaron crossover is found at values of @xmath27 which are sensibly larger than in the absence of strong correlation .",
    "as it has been discussed in many previous studies , the coupling @xmath27 is not the only parameter which controls the properties of e - ph interaction , since also the phonon frequency plays an important role.@xcite in this section we investigate precisely the role of this quantity in strongly correlated systems .    in fig .",

    "this behavior is indeed limited to @xmath71 , while for smaller frequencies the phonons play a more standard role , decreasing @xmath31 , as expressed by a negative @xmath67 .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath67 displays a non - monotonic behavior by further decreasing @xmath9 .",

    "the three cases @xmath43 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are shown on the same scale.,width=283 ]    the same phenomenon can be observed by plotting the effective mass @xmath32 as a function of @xmath9 at fixed @xmath27 , as we do in fig .",

    "the derivative of this curve is a measure of the isotope coefficient on the effective mass @xmath80 . for pure e - ph systems @xmath81 always decreases with @xmath9 at fixed @xmath27 : in the adiabatic regime it initially decreases linearly with @xmath9 while , for @xmath82 , it scales as @xmath83.@xcite therefore the isotope coefficient @xmath84 is always negative .",
    "we find instead that , in the presence of strong correlation , @xmath81 can increase as a function of @xmath9 .",
    "this effect is larger for densities close to the density - driven metal - insulator transition : for instance , for @xmath47 , the value of @xmath80 for @xmath85 and @xmath86 is a positive , even if quite small , number @xmath87 . for values of @xmath9 around @xmath88",
    "the effective mass becomes instead almost independent on the phonon frequency , then @xmath80 changes sign and @xmath32 monotonically approaches the asymptotic antiadiabatic value .",
    "these results have an interesting consequence on the interpretation of the experiments on strongly correlated materials : the sign and the magnitude of @xmath80 is very sensitive to the values of the electron - phonon coupling and of the phonon frequency of the specific compound.@xcite furthermore , a small value of @xmath80 can be observed if a compound is in the crossover region between the two regimes , but this can not be interpreted as a sign of applicability of the migdal - eliashberg theory , despite this latter predicts indeed @xmath89 . turning to the cuprates , the sizable ( @xmath90 ) negative isotopic effect for the effective mass extracted from the isotopic dependence of the penetration depth,@xcite would suggest quite larger values of @xmath27 than those studied here , putting these materials near ( or beyond ) the polaronic instability .",
    "it is well possible that the antiferromagnetic correlations , neglected in this paper , favor a polaronic behavior at least by decreasing doping .",
    "indeed the experimental evidences for a polaronic behavior in the cuprates are limited to extremely small doping , well inside the antiferromagnetic phase.@xcite    the isotope effect has instead a different behavior at half - filling for @xmath33 .",
    "close to the mott - hubbard transition @xmath81 decreases with @xmath9 , but the absolute value of @xmath80 is extremely large.@xcite this can be explained once more by the effective - hubbard picture with @xmath91 and @xmath92 valid at half - filling and for @xmath33 : close to the mott - hubbard transition , in fact , dmft predicts that , for a pure hubbard model with @xmath93 , @xmath94 i.e. @xmath95 an increase in the phonon frequency @xmath9 at fixed @xmath27 determines then a sizable decrease in the effective mass .",
    "the final result is @xmath96 , in other words the absolute value of @xmath80 gets larger and larger , the closer one gets to the mott transition .",
    "finally we notice that the bare value of @xmath67 obtained in the absence of correlations does not depend strongly on the phonon frequency up to @xmath97 . in the adiabatic limit by @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the non interacting density of states at the fermi energy . for a semicircular density of states and @xmath100",

    "4 , it turns out that this bare value is larger by a factor @xmath102 than the corresponding maximum values in the interacting case . if we define an effective coupling for the quasiparticles according to @xmath103 , we see that @xmath104 is rather smaller than @xmath27 and this reduction is unusually enhanced at small frequency ( @xmath105 will instead be maximum at @xmath72 ) . at the same time , as discussed in sec . [",
    "sec : zeta ] , the polaronic crossover is pushed to higher values of @xmath27 .",
    "one of the main results of the previous analysis is that strong correlation tends to reduce the effects of e - ph interaction , and the size of this effect depends on the phonon frequency .",
    "an important question is whether or not the behavior of the quasiparticle weight @xmath31 obtained in dmft in the metallic region away from polaronic instabilities can be captured , at least qualitatively , by a weak coupling approach to the interaction between quasiparticles and phonons . in particular we can test the validity of a fermi - liquid analysis in which a clear hierarchy is supposed : electron - electron correlations create heavy quasiparticles , which in turn interact with the phonons via a renormalized density vertex .",

    "the interaction term @xmath147 between electrons with spin @xmath8 and @xmath150 contributes in fact with @xmath151 and the remaining @xmath152 comes from the term @xmath148 between electrons with the same spin @xmath8 .",
    "the equal - spin term gives also rise to a fock diagram :    @xmath153 - \\frac{\\omega_0}{i\\omega_n - e+\\omega_0 } \\left [ f(e ) + b(\\omega_0 ) \\right ] \\right),\\ ] ]    where @xmath154 and @xmath155 denotes respectively the fermi and bose functions , and @xmath156 is the density of state per spin . in the small-@xmath9 limit",
    "this yields the well known @xmath157 result,@xcite and therefore the hartree - fock ( hf ) self - energy at zero frequency is given by the hartree term only , i.e. @xmath158 in the opposite limit , i.e. for @xmath159 keeping @xmath27 constant , it can be easily seen that eq .",
    "( [ fock ] ) is equal to @xmath160 , so that one obtains @xmath161    it is quite obvious that the hf scheme is not expected to hold for the large values of the hubbard repulsion ( @xmath35 ) , we are dealing with . for the pure hubbard model it has indeed been found with iterated perturbation theory solution of the dmft , that the hartree - fock @xmath2-dependence can be canceled by higher order contributions.@xcite this finding",
    "is confirmed by ed - dmft of the pure hubbard model , where the low frequency self - energy is almost independent on @xmath2 for all @xmath162 .",
    "@xcite    therefore we can expect that in the antiadiabatic limit , where the interaction is exactly a hubbard one , the whole @xmath163 factor multiplying the density in the hf self - energy ( see eq .",
    "( [ sigmahf_antiadiab ] ) ) , is equally counteracted by higher - order terms .",
    "this is confirmed by our results of fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] , where @xmath164 for all the considered densities in the antiadiabatic regime .",
    "this value is nothing but the constant term of eq .",
    "( [ sigmahf_antiadiab ] ) , which survives the cancellation of the density - dependent term .    in the opposite adiabatic limit",
    ", we do not expect the phonon part of ( [ sigmahf_adiab ] ) to follow the same fate of the purely electronic one .",
    "in this regime , in fact , the phonon - mediated attraction is of completely different nature with respect to the instantaneous hubbard repulsion and the terms containing @xmath27 , beyond the hf , are not forced to behave like the hubbard term . in other words , while for large @xmath9 the phonons induce a screening of the coulomb repulsion leading to an effective repulsion @xmath165 , at vanishing phonon frequency this effect is not present and @xmath166 .",
    "on the basis of these considerations , in the limit @xmath167 , we expect a cancellation only of the @xmath2-term in ( [ sigmahf_adiab ] ) , leading to @xmath168 . such a relation is confirmed by the dmft data for small @xmath9 and fits remarkably well with behavior obtained at all the considered values of the density , for the chemical potential ( see the continuous line in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] ) .",
    "this also clarifies the origin of the opposite behavior displayed by @xmath139 for @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "in fact , as it can be seen still in fig . [ fig : mu ] , the fully antiadiabatic curve ( denoted by @xmath64),@xcite lays below all the other ones for @xmath141 , contrary to the case of @xmath47 in which it lays above . moreover , still in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu ] it can be seen that the chemical potential is almost completely independent on @xmath9 for @xmath43 , which is precisely what is predicted by the above considerations at quarter filling .",
    "this supports our idea that the frequency dependence of the @xmath27-contribution to @xmath139 reflects the frequency dependence of the coulomb screening by phonons , even though we can not put this idea on a quantitative basis as we did instead near the mott transition at half - filling .",
    "in this paper we have studied the effects of the e - ph interaction on a strongly correlated metal for filling different from @xmath171 . choosing a large value of @xmath172 the quasiparticle properties of the system",
    "are mainly controlled by the electron - electron correlations and polaronic features only appear at values of e - ph coupling @xmath27 larger by at least a factor two than those in the absence of correlation .",
    "however , even if the effective e - ph coupling for quasiparticles is reduced by the large hubbard repulsion , we have identified a strong influence of the phonon dynamics .",
    "the quasiparticle weight @xmath31 , which in dmft is inversely proportional to the effective mass , becomes very small because of the localizing effect of the hubbard repulsion but it is still substantially influenced by the value of the phonon frequency and displays an unusual isotope effect .",
    "specifically , since @xmath31 depends non monotonically on @xmath9 , the isotope coefficient of the effective mass changes sign .",
    "this change of sign is a strong deviation with respect to migdal - eliashberg theory , and it is not present in the half - filled system , except for peculiar situations close to the bipolaronic transition and for specific values of @xmath172.@xcite the effective quasiparticle e - ph coupling is particularly reduced in the small phonon frequency limit . from this point of view",
    "our dmft results bear similarities with a mean - field calculation based on slave bosons and a variational lang - firsov transformation.@xcite in that approach one obtains near half - filling @xmath173 at large @xmath172 and small @xmath14 . in the adiabatic limit",
    "this expression implies a vanishingly small @xmath104 , while in our dmft @xmath104 remains finite for @xmath174 , as a result of the quantum fluctuations that are neglected in the mean - field calculation .",
    "these values of @xmath104 are however quite smaller than the bare @xmath27 , in agreement with a fermi liquid description in terms of renormalized e - ph vertices in the static limit .",
    "it is interesting to note that the same mean - field approach / citepaolo2 predicts at large @xmath172 a critical value @xmath175 for polaron formation which is slightly larger than the adiabatic value @xmath176 which is found for spinless fermions in the half - filled holstein model and somewhat smaller than our estimates @xmath177 at @xmath35 .",
    "@xcite for a single hole in the @xmath0-@xmath1 with @xmath178 a much smaller @xmath179 is required to reach a polaronic behavior .",
    "this is understood in terms of the pre - localizing mechanism associated with the antiferromagnetic background.@xcite    beside the neglect of antiferromagnetic order and spin correlations , our dmft approach is limited by the inability to capture the @xmath180-dependence of the self - energy , and accordingly of the quasiparticle weight .",
    "this limitations does not allow us to describe the momentum dependence of the effective e - ph coupling that has been proposed to be induced by strong correlations by various authors.@xcite the momentum dependence can be restored by means of cluster extensions of dmft , such as the cellular dynamical mean - field theory .",
    "it has already been shown that , for the purely electronic hubbard model , a significant momentum dependence establishes when the mott transition is approached already for small clusters such as a @xmath181 plaquette.@xcite    a further crucial assumption of the present work is the holstein form of the electron - phonon coupling term .",
    "although this kind of description has been justified for the cuprates by explicit calculations starting from a full three - band model,@xcite it must be noted that the symmetry of the electronic degrees of freedom which are coupled by phonons plays a very important role in the competition between the phonon - mediated attraction and the coulomb repulsion . in a model for fullerenes , in fact ,",
    "in which the electrons are mainly coupled to jahn - teller vibrations , it has been found that the attraction between electrons is not screened by a strong local repulsion , giving rise to unexpected phenomena like high - temperature superconductivity driven by strong correlation.@xcite more specifically in those models , phonon - mediated superconductivity is enhanced by the strong correlations close to the mott transition , due to the specific symmetry of the phonons , which couple with orbital and spin degrees of freedom , as opposed to the holstein coupling with the electron density .",
