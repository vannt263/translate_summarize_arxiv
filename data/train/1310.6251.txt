    "considerable interest has recently been focused on the optomechanical system as an excellent candidate for studying the transition of a macroscopic degree of freedom from the classical to the quantum regime .",
    "this system also provides novel routes for practical applications such as detection and interferometry of gravitational waves@xcite and quantum limited displacement sensing @xcite .",
    "the standard and simplest setup of this system is a fabry - perot cavity in which one of the mirrors is much lighter than the other , so that it can move under the effect of the radiation pressure force .",
    "state - of - the - art technology allows experimental demonstration of cooling of the vibrational mode of the mechanical oscillator to its ground state@xcite and strong optomechanical coupling between the vibrational mode of the mechanical oscillator and cavity field@xcite .",
    "this coupling is intrinsically nonlinear since the length of the cavity depends upon the intensity of the field in analogous way to the optical length of a kerr material@xcite .",
    "therefore it enables pondermotive squeezing of the field@xcite , photon blockade @xcite , generation of nonclassical states of the mechanical and optical mode @xcite , optical bistability@xcite and phonon - photon entanglement in the bistable regime @xcite . besides this intrinsic nonlinearity",
    ", the presence of an optical parametric amplifier ( opa ) @xcite or the optical kerr medium @xcite inside the cavity has opened up a new domain for combining nonlinear optics and optomechanics towards the enhancement of quantum effects .",
    "it has been predicted @xcite that the presence of an opa in a single - mode fabry - perot cavity causes a strong coupling between the oscillating mirror and the cavity mode resulting from increasing the intracavity photon number .",
    "also , when the optomechanical cavity contains an optical kerr medium with strong @xmath0 nonlinearity , the photon - photon repulsion and the reduction of the cavity photon fluctuations provide a feasible route towards controlling the dynamics of the micromirror@xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the interaction of a single - mode field with both a kerr medium and a parametric nonlinearity is a well - known quantum optical model which has been proposed for the generation of nonclassical states of the cavity field @xcite .    here",
    ", we consider the interaction of a single - mode field with both a weak kerr medium and a parametric nonlinearity in an intrinsically nonlinear optomechanical system .",
    "in particular , we investigate the multistability , intensity , back - action cooling and stationary optomechanical entanglement .",
    "it turns out that the mean intracavity photon number , in addition to bistability , exhibits tristability for a certain range of the parameters which can be controlled by the intrinsic and external nonlinearities in the system .",
    "then , we investigate the effect of kerr - down conversion nonlinearity on the back - action ground state cooling of the mirror based on the covariance matrix and identify the modified optimal regime for cooling .",
    "we will show that the lower bound of the resolved sideband regime and the minimum attainable phonon number can be less than that of a bare cavity by controlling the parametric nonlinearity and the phase of the field driving the opa .",
    "also , the weak kerr nonlinearity can be used to extend the domain of the stability to the desired range of the effective detuning in which the effective temperature of the system minimizes .",
    "then we show that for a fixed effective detuning , in spite of the bare cavity , one of the stability parameters ( the counterpart of the bistability parameter ) is a nonlinear function of the input power , allows to approach significant entanglement simultaneously with the ground state cooling of the mirror . in the last part of the paper we shall focus on the generation of stationary entanglement in the presence of the nonlinearity and show that not only the entanglement is not a monotonic function of the optomechanical coupling strength , but also the two stability parameters of the system are the key parameters for maximizing the degree of entanglement . based on these results",
    "we show that in the tristable regime , for the first and second branches the degree of entanglement is maximum at the end of the branches , while for the third branch the phonon - photon entanglement is null .",
    "as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , we consider a kerr - down conversion optomechanical system composed of a degenerate opa and a nonlinear kerr medium placed within a fabry - perot cavity formed by a fixed partially transmitting mirror and one movable perfectly reflecting mirror in equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the movable mirror is free to move along the cavity axis and is treated as a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator with effective mass @xmath2 , frequency @xmath3 and energy decay rate @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mechanical quality factor . the cavity field is coherently driven by an input laser field with frequency @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath7 through the fixed mirror .",
    "furthermore , the system is pumped by a coupling field to produce parametric oscillation and induce the kerr nonlinearity in the cavity . in our investigation",
    ", we restrict the model to the case of single - cavity and mechanical modes@xcite .",
    "the single cavity - mode assumption is justified in the adiabatic limit , i.e. , @xmath8 in which @xmath9 is the speed of light in vacuum and @xmath10 is the cavity length in the absence of the cavity field .",
    "we also assume that the induced resonance frequency shift of the cavity and the kerr medium are much smaller than the longitudinal - mode spacing in the cavity .",
    "furthermore , one can restrict to a single mechanical mode when the detection bandwidth is chosen such that it includes only a single , isolated , mechanical resonance and mode - mode coupling is negligible .        under these conditions , the total hamiltonian of the system in a frame rotating at the laser frequency @xmath6 can be written as @xmath11 where    [ hamil ] @xmath12    the first two terms in @xmath13 are , respectively , the free hamiltonians of the cavity field with annihilation(creation ) operator @xmath14 and the movable mirror with resonance frequency @xmath3 and dimensionless position and momentum operators @xmath15 and @xmath16 . the third term describes the optomechanical coupling between the cavity field and the mechanical oscillator due to the radiation pressure force with coupling constant @xmath17 , and the last term in @xmath13 describes the driving of the intracavity mode with the input laser .",
    "also , the two terms in @xmath18 describe , respectively , the coupling of the intracavity field with the opa and the kerr medium ; @xmath19 is the nonlinear gain of the opa which is proportional to the pump power driving amplitude , @xmath20 is the phase of the field driving the opa , and @xmath21 is the anharmonicity parameter proportional to the third order nonlinear susceptibility @xmath22 of the kerr medium .",
    "the input laser field populates the intracavity mode through the partially transmitting mirror , then the photons in the cavity will exert a radiation pressure force on the movable mirror . in a realistic treatment of the dynamics of the system , the cavity - field damping due to the photon - leakage through the incomplete mirror and the brownian noise associated with the coupling of the oscillating mirror to its thermal bath should be considered . using the input - output formalism of quantum optics@xcite , we can consider the effects of these sources of noise and dissipation in the quantum langevin equations of motion .",
    "for the given hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) , we obtain the following nonlinear equations of motion    [ langevin ] @xmath23    where @xmath24 is the cavity decay rate through the input mirror and @xmath25 is the input vacuum noise operator characterized by the following correlation functions @xcite    [ noise1 ] @xmath26    the brownian noise operator @xmath27 describes the heating of the mirror by the thermal bath at temperature @xmath28 and is characterized by the following correlation function @xcite @xmath29d\\omega,\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "we are interested in the steady - state regime and small fluctuations with respect to the steady state .",
    "thus we obtain the steady - state mean values of @xmath16 , @xmath15 and @xmath31 as @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34 denotes the new equilibrium position of the movable mirror , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 is the effective detuning of the cavity which includes both the radiation pressure and the kerr medium effects .",
    "it is obvious that the optical path and hence the cavity detuning are modified in an intensity - dependent way .",
    "the first modification which is a mechanical nonlinearity , arises from the radiation pressure - induced coupling between the movable mirror and the cavity field and the second modification comes from the presence of the nonlinear kerr medium in the optomechanical system . since the mean intracavity photon number in the steady state @xmath37 satisfies a third - order equation , it can have three real solutions and hence the system may exhibit multistability for a certain range of parameters .",
    "the multisolution region exists for intracavity intensity values between @xmath38 and @xmath39 with @xmath40 the multistability of the solution fails if @xmath41 and requires @xmath42 .    to study the effect of the presence of the kerr - down conversion nonlinearity on the steady - state response of the optomechanical system we consider a cavity with length @xmath43 mm and decay rate @xmath44 which is driven by a laser with @xmath45 nm .",

    "in conclusion , we have studied the interaction of a single - mode field with both a weak kerr medium and a parametric nonlinearity in an intrinsically nonlinear optomechanical system .",
    "we have investigated the stability behavior of the intracavity mean photon number , the intensity , cooling and stationary entanglement .",
    "we have found that the combination of the nonlinearities leads to a shift of the resonance frequency of the cavity toward the lower values and appearance of three real roots for the steady - state response of the system .",
    "we have derived the general condition for tristability in the system .",
    "furthermore , we have studied the cooling and stationary entanglement by using the covariance matrix formalism . in particular , we have shown that the lower bound of the resolved sideband regime and the minimum attainable phonon number can be less than that of a bare cavity by controlling the parametric nonlinearity and the phase of the field driving the opa .",
    "the weak kerr nonlinearity can be used to extend the domain of the stability to the desired range of the effective detuning in which the effective temperature of the system is minimized .",
    "also , the kerr nonlinearity modifies the behavior of the stability parameter and allows to approach significant entanglement simultaneously with the ground state cooling of the mirror . in the investigation of the degree of stationary entanglement between the cavity and the mechanical modes we have identified four key parameters that affect the behavior of the entanglement .",
    "they are effective detuning of the cavity , the optomechanical coupling and the two stability parameters of the system .",
    "also , as shown in this paper the present scheme allows to have significant entanglement in the tristable regime for the lower and middle branches which makes the current scheme distinct from the bare optomechanical system .",
