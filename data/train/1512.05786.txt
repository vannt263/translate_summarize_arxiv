    "one of the minimalistic extensions of the standard model ( sm ) is that by one or more gauge singlet real ( or complex ) scalar field(s ) .",
    "motivations to introduce a singlet scalar to the sm are , amongst others : ( i ) to provide a viable cold dark matter ( cdm ) candidate through higgs portal models @xcite , ( ii ) to make the electroweak phase transition a strong first - order one @xcite , and ( iii ) to address the naturalness problem of the sm higgs boson @xcite .",
    "phenomenological aspects of such singlets have also been discussed in case of colliders @xcite , and in the context of electroweak precision constraints @xcite .",
    "such a singlet with a mass around 750 gev may also be responsible for the recently observed excess in the diphoton channel @xcite if one adds vectorial fermions to the model .",
    "one often imposes a @xmath1-symmetry on the scalar potential under which the sm particles are all even and the extra singlet(s ) is(are ) odd , which can make the lightest @xmath1-odd particle a cdm candidate . in an analogous way to what happens in r - parity conserving supersymmetry and universal extra dimension models , a @xmath1-symmetry on the scalar potential under which the singlet @xmath0 is odd , can in principle lead to the higgs portal dark matter models where @xmath0 constitutes the dark matter .",
    "a necessary condition for this is zero ( or infinitesimally small ) vacuum expectation value ( vev ) for @xmath0 , so that it can not mix with the sm doublet scalar @xmath6 .",
    "one must remember that this @xmath1 is rather ad hoc , introduced just for the sake of having a cdm candidate .",
    "the nature of the tree - level scalar potential has also been discussed by several authors @xcite .",
    "the potential is more complicated than the sm one because of one extra field and the possibility that the cp - even neutral component of the su(2 ) doublet @xmath6 , which will be denoted by @xmath7 , and the gauge singlet scalar @xmath0 can both have nonzero vevs .",
    "we denote these vevs by @xmath8 and @xmath9 respectively .",
    "if there is only one minimum for @xmath9 , one often uses the shift symmetry @xmath10 to ensure @xmath11 , which in turn ensures a cdm candidate if the model is @xmath1-symmetric .",
    "however , if there are more than one minima for @xmath9 , there is no particular advantage in using the shift symmetry , except ensuring that @xmath11 is an extremum .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nature of the tree - level potential of the sm extended by one real singlet scalar , which we call sm+s , with and without the @xmath1-symmetry .",
    "we find the allowed parameter space for three different sm+s models : ( 1 ) the higgs portal model _",
    "i.e. _ , the @xmath1-symmetric model where @xmath0 can be a cdm candidate , ( 2 ) the @xmath1-symmetric model with no cdm candidate , and ( 3 ) the @xmath1-asymmetric model .",
    "obviously , the allowed parameter space has to be consistent with all theoretical and current experimental constraints .",
    "for the third case , @xmath1 breaking is soft , coming from operators with mass dimension less than 4 .",
    "dimension-4 @xmath1 breaking operators are forbidden from gauge and/or lorentz symmetry .",
    "as we consider only one real singlet scalar , all the couplings are real in these models .",
    "data from the large hadron collider ( lhc ) essentially constrains the mixing between @xmath0 and @xmath7 .",
    "the mixing angle @xmath12 is constrained to be so small that all sm+s models also satisfy the constraints coming from the oblique parameters .",
    "we will discuss it in detail later .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath13 boson mass also puts serious restrictions on the parameter space of sm+s @xcite .",
    "apart from these experimental constraints , there are three other important constraints .",
    "firstly , the potential has to be stable at all energy scales till one reaches the range of validity .",
    "this range is , in general , way below the planck scale , apart from some exceptional choices of the parameters . above this limit , either at least one of the couplings blow up , or the potential becomes unbounded from below along some direction in the field space .",
    "the second one is the existence of a minimum , either global or local , where @xmath14 gev , which will be referred to as the electroweak ( ew ) vacuum .",
    "the third constraint comes from the stability of the ew vacuum ; if there is another minimum deeper than the ew vacuum , the tunnelling lifetime should not be less than the age of the universe .",
    "we also study the effect of one - loop corrections to the potential . in general",
    ", the one - loop corrections are expected to be small compared to the tree - level potential , unless one looks along a flat direction .",
    "even when both @xmath0 and @xmath6 have non - zero mass terms , one can find a direction in the field space , at least for large values of the fields , following the prescriptions of gildener and weinberg @xcite .",
    "one should also choose the regularization scale properly .",
    "this choice , in principle , is arbitrary if one uses renormalization group ( rg ) improved couplings . on the other hand",
    ", one can always tune the scale so that the one - loop corrected ew vacuum still has @xmath15 gev  @xcite .",
    "however , this makes the choice of the regularization scale dependent on the model parameters .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in",
    ", we give a brief outline of the singlet - enhanced sm , and discuss the constraints .",
    "discusses the @xmath1-symmetric model where the cdm is allowed , and is on models with a non - zero singlet - doublet mixing .",
    "while these are all tree - level results , we discuss the one - loop corrections to the potential in .",
    "in , we summerize and conclude .",

    "so , for the low-@xmath19 regions , it is the vacuum stability that mostly controls the allowed range .",

    "the potential of sm+s , a real singlet enhanced sm , shows several interesting features . in this paper , we have investigated the parameter space for several types of sm+s : the higgs portal dark matter models , the potential with an explicit @xmath1-symmetry and having singlet - doublet mixing , the @xmath1-asymmetric potential with a stable ew minimum , or the same with an unstable or metastable ew minimum .",
    "the general features can be summarized as follows .",
    "* adding one more real singlet makes the potential less stable in general at a high energy .",

    "all the quartic couplings , namely , @xmath98 , @xmath21 , and @xmath19 , have to be small at the ew scale to keep the model valid up to a high scale , as the @xmath82-functions are coupled .",
    "( however , such new scalar couplings are helpful to avoid the vacuum stability bound , coming from the negative pull caused by the large top yukawa coupling . again , such conclusions are not valid if there are more degrees of freedom , like vectorlike fermions . )",
    "our numerical results are shown at one - loop but inclusion of higher - order corrections do not change the result qualitatively . in particular , if we start with a large value of either @xmath98 or @xmath21 , the model hits the landau pole at a relatively low scale .",
    "this can be taken as a possible indication of some new physics taking over and one should consider the effect of higher - dimensional operators on the low - scale physics . *",
    "while there are some minor variations for the allowed range of parameters among different class of models ( _ e.g. _ @xmath19 ) , the overlap is significant , and so one has to determine all the couplings experimentally to know what class of sm+s it really is .",
    "this is , of course , an extremely challenging task , if not outright impossible ; the determination of @xmath21 is apparently beyond the reach of any present or upcoming colliders unless there is a significant mixing between the singlet and the doublet and the higgs self - couplings are determined with sufficient accuracy . for the prospect of determination of the singlet - doublet mixing angle in future colliders , we refer the reader to ref .  @xcite . *",
    "the tree - level results are robust enough as far as the metastability issue is concerned .",
    "this is expected as we are not looking along any flat direction .",
