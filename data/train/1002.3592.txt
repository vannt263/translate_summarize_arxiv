    "group field theories ( gfts ) @xcite are quantum field theories over group manifolds and can be also viewed as higher rank tensor field theories @xcite .",
    "they provide one of the most promising framework for a background free theory of quantum gravity in which one sums both over topologies and geometries .",
    "indeed , each feynman graph of a @xmath13 dimensional gft can be dually associated with a discrete spacetime ( @xmath13-simplicial complex ) via a specific triangulation and gluing rules given by the covariance and vertices ( basic @xmath13-simplex ) of the theory .",
    "the functional integral formalism then defines a weighted sum over triangulations which is a weighted `` sum over topologies '' with each weight ( amplitude ) related to a `` sum of geometries '' ( via a spin foam formalism @xcite ) .",
    "some early results on power counting and non - perturbative resummation of such models are in @xcite .",
    "group field theory is a particular kind of quantum field theory , hence it is natural to ask the question of its renormalizability .",
    "a complete renormalization group analysis for gfts is still lacking and the first steps for such a program have been made only recently @xcite . for the three dimensional boulatov model a rigorous power counting theorem has been obtained for a particular class of graphs called type i , which satisfy a contractibility condition @xcite . given a cutoff @xmath14 in the peter - weyl field expansion , type i graphs diverge as @xmath15 , where @xmath16 denotes the number of `` bubbles '' .",
    "these bubbles are closed surfaces whose exact definition is clumsy in general @xcite . in @xcite scaling bounds for feynman amplitudes of the boulatov model have been established together with constructive results .",
    "however in that theory generalized tadpoles dominate over other graphs .",
    "this situation improves markedly in the case of colored gft models @xcite . among the nice features of these models we quote : ( 1 ) in the fermionic case a @xmath17 global symmetry in the field indices ; ( 2 ) a clear definition of `` bubbles '' of any dimension , which means that the graphs of these colored models define a full @xmath13-simplicial complex , not just a 2-complex as in spin foam theory ; ( 3 ) a computable homology for this complex implying that the corresponding dual triangulated objects are manifolds or pseudo - manifolds but with only point - like singularities ; ( 4 ) the absence of generalized tadpoles and of _ tadfaces _ ; ( 5 ) the existence of an exhaustive sequence of cuts @xcite for any graphs of these models .",
    "this leads to better scaling bounds in any dimension for the feynman amplitudes of these models @xcite .",
    "a general power counting theorem is a difficult problem even for the colored gfts . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a further simplification , namely an abelianized version of gft that we shortly call `` linearized gft '' .",
    "this model is also interesting as a kind of asymptotic limit of gft at high fourier frequencies .",
    "we compute the exact power counting for any graph of linearized gfts . in the colored case",
    "this power counting is reexpressed in terms of the colored homology introduced by gurau @xcite .",
    "the connection with the @xmath15 power counting of type i graphs in @xcite is clarified ; the linearized colored graphs have power counting @xmath15 if and only if their second homology class vanishes .",
    "exact power counting is also established for amplitudes of the ordinary nonlinarized models but under a certain planarity condition .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 fixes our notations , introduces the linearized gfts and establishes the power counting of their graphs in terms of a certain incidence matrix between lines and faces .",
    "the proof relies on evaluation of determinants of quadratic forms through their pfaffian representations in the manner of @xcite and allows not only to find the exact ultraviolet power counting but also an infrared power counting .",
    "more generally we define the analog of symanzik polynomials for the linearized models , which potentially contain much more information .",
    "these polynomials are connected to generalized contraction / deletion moves which for colored graphs have been first explored in @xcite .",
    "section 3 contains the basic definitions of colored graphs and their homology and reexpresses the power counting of linearized colored graphs in term of their additional structure .",
    "we give a computation of the ultraviolet degree of divergence in terms of the homology of the colored graph as defined in @xcite .",
    "section 4 introduces an other technique .",
    "the jacket of a graph is defined either for restricted boulatov models or for colored models .",
    "it is a matrix - like piece of the theory .",
    "an exact non commutative momentum routing is introduced for the dual of the jacket . when the jacket is planar , the power counting is exactly the number of cycles of the complement of the jacket .",
    "finally , section 5 provides examples , further discussions and conclusions .",
    "an ordinary @xmath13-dimensional gft is a field theory for a field defined over @xmath13 copies of a group @xmath18 with a certain gauge invariance and a certain pattern of interaction . for simplicity",
    ", we may consider mostly the euclidean 3d case in which @xmath19 but indicate which of our results are general for any dimension .",
    "we will also assume that the field is not symmetric under any permutation of the @xmath13 arguments .",
    "there will also be no symmetrization operators inserted , neither in the propagators nor in the vertices , so that the category of graphs considered will be the category of stranded graphs without any twists of the strands .",
    "the hilbert space of square integrable functions on @xmath20 is @xmath21 .",
    "the hilbert space of gauge invariants fields that is of fields invariant under the `` diagonal '' action of the group @xmath18 @xmath22 is a subset @xmath23 .",
    "the interaction is homogenous of degree @xmath24 and patterned in the form of a @xmath13 simplex .",
    "for instance in three dimensions this interaction has the form : @xmath25:=\\lambda \\int\\prod_{i=1}^{6}dg_i\\ \\phi(g_1,g_2,g_3)\\phi(g_3,g_4,g_5)\\phi(g_5,g_2,g_6)\\phi(g_6,g_4,g_1).\\ ] ] the six integration variables are repeated twice , following the pattern of the edges of a tetrahedron .    in the language of gaussian measures",
    "the partition function is @xmath26\\ e^{-\\lambda s_{int}[\\phi]},\\ ] ] where @xmath27 $ ] is the normalized gaussian measure whose covariance @xmath28 can be viewed as the orthogonal projection from @xmath29 to @xmath30 implementing ( [ invariances ] ) through an average over the diagonal action of the group @xmath31    graphs are therefore stranded with @xmath13 strands per propagator .",
    "the ordinary feynman rules to build graphs out of propagators and vertices give for a stranded graph @xmath32 of this model an amplitude which is the following formal expression @xmath33 where each line @xmath34 propagates @xmath13 strands @xmath35 from edge variable @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "suppose that we choose both an arbitrary orientation of each line @xmath34 of the graph and of each face ( closed set of strands ) .",
    "the integration over all edge variables can be explicitly performed , leading to an other ( still formal ) expression for the feynman amplitude , but solely in terms of an integral over line variables :    @xmath38    where @xmath39 , @xmath40 are the set of lines and faces of @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the oriented product @xmath41 means that the variables @xmath42 of the delta functions ( which are the @xmath43 holonomies along each face ) has to be taken in the following way : @xmath42 if the orientations of the line @xmath34 and of the face @xmath44 coincide and @xmath45 if they do not .",
    "surprisingly the formal amplitude ( [ amp2 ] ) neither depends of the arbitrary orientation of the lines , nor of those of the faces !",
    "the deep reason is that the two formulas ( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) are equal , but a more pedestrian way to see this is to exploit carefully the parity of the @xmath46 function and of the haar measure under @xmath47 .",
    "however a full proof of this fact should address the fact that both ( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) are infinite in general .",
    "indeed multiplication of distributions is not always allowed .",
    "hence formulas ( [ amp1 ] ) and ( [ amp2 ] ) suffer from what one should consider from the usual field theoretic point of view as an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "however since groups like @xmath43 are compact there is no infrared or large volume divergence associated to the group integrations over the @xmath42 variables in these euclidean gfts .",
    "a _ linearized gft _ is obtained by just changing the group @xmath48 to the additive commutative group of a vector space @xmath49 and repeating all the arguments above .",
    "it can also be considered as an expansion around the origin of unity of the group , in which each group element @xmath42 is replaced by @xmath50 and a taylor expansion is performed which only retains the linear forms in the new @xmath42 variables in all the @xmath46 functions of ( [ amp2 ] ) . in that case , @xmath51 would just be the dimension of the group or of its lie algebra .",
    "but in the rest of this paper we shall consider @xmath52 for simplicity .",
    "let us introduce now some terminology .",
    "non - regular faces , also called tadfaces are faces which goes several times through the same propagator .",
    "a regular graph is a graph without any tadface .",
    "unfortunately , ordinary gfts typically generate tadfaces and non - regular graphs .",
    "non - regular faces play a bit the same annoying role than tadpoles play in ordinary graphs and ordinary field theory .",
    "they are difficult to capture through an incidence matrix . although they are somewhat trivial they may perturb naive versions of contraction - deletion rules .",
    "the linearized gft amplitude is conveniently defined in terms of a rectangular @xmath53 by @xmath54 incidence matrix @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the number of faces of @xmath32 and @xmath57 is its number of lines .",
    "@xmath55 is defined as the algebraic number of passages of the face @xmath44 through the line @xmath34 , counting as @xmath58 each passage with coinciding orientation of @xmath44 and @xmath34 and as @xmath59 each passage with opposite orientation of @xmath44 and @xmath34 .",
    "hence @xmath60 .    for a regular graph @xmath61 with @xmath62 where @xmath63 stands for the orientation .",
    "[ orient ]    the linearized amplitiude of a regular graph is then given by @xmath64 again although the incidence matrix does depend on the chosen orientations , the amplitude ( [ amp3 ] ) does not depend on them , as we can arbitrarily multiply each line or column of @xmath65 and compensate for that using either parity of the @xmath46 function or changing @xmath42 to @xmath66 .",
    "formula ( [ amp3 ] ) remains ill - defined and the corresponding amplitude is formally infinite but now for two distinct reasons :    - the set of @xmath54 linear forms @xmath67 may typically not be made of independent forms , i.e. the rank @xmath68 of the rectangular matrix @xmath55 may be smaller than @xmath53 , in which case the corresponding @xmath46 functions can not be multiplied .",
    "this impossibility of multiplication of distributions should be considered as an ultraviolet divergence .    -",
    "even if the corresponding multiplication of distributions is regularized , e.g. by replacing @xmath46 distributions by gaussian integrals , the rank @xmath68 of the rectangular matrix @xmath55 could be strictly smaller than @xmath54 , the number of internal lines . in that case",
    ", the corresponding quadratic form in the @xmath42 variables would not be definite , so that the @xmath42 integrations do not fully converge at infinity because there is no decay in some directions in @xmath69 .",
    "this kind of divergence should be considered of infrared type in field theory .",
    "it has no analog in the non - linearized euclidean group field theories because the group used there is compact ; but it has some analogs in lorentzian group field theories .    hence we expect :    the ultraviolet degree of divergence of a linearized regular gft graph is @xmath70 and its infrared degree of divergence is @xmath71 , where @xmath68 is the rank of the @xmath55 matrix .    to give a precise mathematical content to this statement the simplest an dmost natural proposal , which we follow in this paper , is to regularize the amplitudes ( [ amp3 ] ) through gaussian regulation both of the @xmath46 functions and of the @xmath42 integrals .",
    "hence we are lead to consider infrared regulators @xmath72 which break gauge invariance but allow the amplitude to be well defined even for a noncompact group as is @xmath73 , and to replace the @xmath46 function of each face @xmath44 by a regularized normalized gaussian function of the form : @xmath74    therefore the ill - defined amplitude of a regular vacuum graph ( [ amp3 ] ) is re - expressed using the regularized delta function ( [ deltc ] ) as and @xmath75 .",
    "we also forget inessential multiplicative factors . ]",

    "the limit ( [ amp3 ] ) is formally recovered as all @xmath78 and all @xmath79 .",
    "we start now the derivations of our main results on exact power counting theorems . at first we will discuss the case of vacuum graphs and then we will focus on graphs with external legs .",
    "the proof of the second theorem will be shortened following similar steps as for the situation without external legs .",
    "[ theo1 ] for any connected vacuum graph @xmath80 of the linearized gft , we have @xmath81 where @xmath82 is an inessential factor .",

    "we introduce the vector @xmath85 and the matrix defined by its block sub - matrices @xmath86 gaussian integration gives , up to inessential normalizations @xmath87 e^{-\\mathfrak{h}^t\\ ,   \\mathfrak{m } \\",

    "for instance , the schur complement formula gives ( [ powuv ] ) , for @xmath90 , @xmath91 .",
    "however this method does not give the detailed dependence of @xmath84 in all joint variables .",
    "more information is obtained by the method of @xcite which provides a pfaffian expansion of a determinant @xmath92 , where @xmath13 is diagonal and @xmath93 is antisymmetric .",
    "it expands the determinant as : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the matrix obtained from @xmath93 after removing lines and columns of indices in @xmath96 .",
    "we first remark that the determinant of @xmath97 coincides with the determinant of @xmath98 obtained from @xmath97 after multiplying the block @xmath99 by @xmath100 and the block @xmath101 by @xmath102 .",
    "this decomposes @xmath103 as the sum of a diagonal and an antisymmetric matrix .",
    "hence @xmath104 where @xmath105 means the pfaffian of @xmath106 with lines and columns in @xmath107 and @xmath108 erased .",
    "remark that this is a polynomial in @xmath109 and @xmath110 with positive integer coefficients which we could call the symanzik topological polynomial of the graph",
    ". it should obey deletion - contraction relations .",
    "we are now in position to find the scaling behaviour of @xmath111 .",
    "this can be done by putting @xmath90 , @xmath91 and identifying the non - zero monomial with the lowest power @xmath112 in @xmath113 in ( [ dete ] ) .",
    "one notices that because equation ( [ dete ] ) is a sum of squares this is equivalent to find the subset @xmath114 with the minimal order such that @xmath115 , in other words to find the minor of maximal rank in @xmath106 .",
    "then @xmath116 , since the rank of @xmath106 is the cardinal of @xmath117 , the complement of @xmath114 in @xmath118 .",
    "we are led to @xmath119 .",
    "this achieves the proof of the ultraviolet power counting .",
    "similarly to get the infrared power counting one should identifying the non - zero monomial with the lowest power @xmath120 in @xmath121 in ( [ dete ] ) , hence find the subset @xmath96 with the minimal order such that @xmath115 .",
    "this means to find again the minor of maximal rank in @xmath106 .",
    "therefore @xmath122 , since the rank of @xmath106 is the cardinal of @xmath123 , the complement of @xmath96 in @xmath124 .",
