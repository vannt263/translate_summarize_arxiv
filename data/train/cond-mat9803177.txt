    "when subjected to shear flow , many complex fluids exhibit shear thickening behaviour where viscosity increases with shear rate .",
    "shear thickening is often discontinuous and may be accompanied by hysteresis and structural changes .",
    "systems where such behaviour has been observed include concentrated colloidal suspensions @xcite and rodlike micelle solutions @xcite .    in the case of colloidal suspensions , it has been suggested that shear thickening is the result of the formation of hydrodynamic clusters @xcite .",
    "these clusters comprise large numbers of particles bound together by short - range lubrication forces and form along the compression axis of the shear .",
    "indeed a detailed analysis of the dynamics of the aggregation of such rotating clusters , in the absence of brownian motion , has recently been performed @xcite and suggests that the discontinuous jump in viscosity is due to a jamming transition where , essentially , a log - jam of clusters occurs .",
    "jamming transitions have also been studied in an apparently different context , that of driven diffusive systems @xcite .",
    "in one dimensional models , jams have been induced by the presence of defects or disorder @xcite or by a non - conserved quantity mediating an effective long - range interaction @xcite . in two - dimensional ( @xmath0 ) driven lattice gases , gridlock effects",
    "have been studied @xcite .",
    "recently , santra and herrmann introduced a simple @xmath0 lattice model of gelation under shear @xcite , which provides a link between colloidal systems and driven lattice gases .",
    "they showed that within the model one finds dynamical scaling as clusters of particles aggregate irreversibly , and that the clusters are aligned roughly along the compression axis of the shear .",
    "the model has been extended to take into account the effect of rotation of the clusters @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we extend the model of @xcite in a different direction by allowing clusters to fragment stochastically .",
    "this models thermal fluctuations in a simple manner and gives rise to the possibility of non - trivial steady states , in contrast to the absorbing state consisting of a single cluster which is always attained with the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "indeed , as we shall show below , we find two types of steady state ",
    "_ unjammed _ , where clusters have some typical size much smaller than the transverse size of the system , and _ jammed _ , in which there are clusters which span the system .",
    "we provide evidence of a discontinuous transition between the two states , with hysteresis , as the fragmentation rate or the shear rate is varied .",
    "we study the kinetics of the jamming process and find evidence for dynamical scaling for both zero and non - zero fragmentation rate .",
    "although there is an intriguing similarity with the colloidal jamming problem studied in @xcite , in practice the transitions we observe arise at very low concentration . in this respect",
    "the behaviour is more like that of the micellar problem of @xcite .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec : model ]",
    "we define the model that we study and simulation results are presented in section [ sec : results ] . in section [ sec : issues ] more general issues concerning the simulations are raised .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "the model is defined on a @xmath0 lattice of length @xmath1 and width @xmath2 , illustrated by an example configuration in figure [ fig : schematic ] .",
    "each lattice site is either occupied by a particle or empty .",
    "the boundary perpendicular to the direction of flow is periodic but no particles may pass through the boundaries parallel to the direction of flow  they are `` hard walls '' .",
    "a simple shear flow is imposed by assigning a velocity @xmath3 to each `` lane '' in the direction of flow given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 runs from @xmath6 to @xmath7 .",
    "each particle in lane @xmath5 is said to have velocity @xmath3 .",
    "hence , the shear rate is @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we consider only non - negative velocities from now on .",
    "there are @xmath11 particles in the system and the concentration is @xmath12    we define a cluster to be a set of particles connected successively by nearest - neighbour bonds on the lattice .",
    "therefore , the nearest neighbour sites belonging to an individual particle are either empty or occupied by particles in the same cluster .",
    "the velocity @xmath13 of a cluster is defined as the mean of the velocities of its constituent particles .",
    "the proximity of a wall does not affect the velocity of a cluster so that one may think of the particles `` slipping '' relative to the walls .",
    "( in contrast , in order to set up a shear flow in a fluid by moving one or both of the walls , a no - slip condition between the _ fluid _ and the walls is required . )",
    "a ( continuous ) `` counter '' variable @xmath14 is associated with each cluster . in each simulation time - step , three steps ( flow , cluster merging and fragmentation ) are performed in the following sequence :    flow : :    the counter @xmath14 for each cluster is incremented by    @xmath13 , the cluster velocity . if @xmath15 for    any cluster , all the particles in that cluster move one site forward    ( _ i.e. _ in the direction of flow ) and @xmath16 . if @xmath17 , no action is taken .",
    "cluster merging : :    at the end of the previous step , some clusters may have become    connected and these clusters are now merged . in merging two clusters ,",
    "the resulting single cluster is assigned a counter which is the    weighted average of the counters of the two constituent clusters    labelled @xmath18 and @xmath19 :    @xmath20 where    @xmath21 is the number of particles in cluster    @xmath18 .",
    "we have checked that this ensures that the average    velocity of clusters in lane @xmath5 is indeed    @xmath3 .",
    "fragmentation : :    this random sequential step allows single particles to leave clusters ,    possibly resulting in the break up of clusters .",
    "the following update    rules are repeated @xmath11 times :    +    1 .",
    "a particle is chosen at random .    2 .",
    "a direction for the particle to move is chosen at random from the    four possibilities .",
    "if the particle is not blocked by another particle in the chosen    direction , it moves one site in that direction with probability    @xmath22 , where @xmath22 may be thought of as the    `` temperature '' of the system .",
    "the moved particle becomes a single - particle cluster with counter    variable equal to that of the cluster it previously belonged to .",
    "if it    adjoins any other clusters , this single - particle cluster is then    merged as detailed previously .",
    "+    the fragmentation update of one particle may result in one of five    outcomes : no change , a particle leaving its cluster , a particle moving    to a different location in the same cluster , movement of a    single - particle cluster or a single - particle cluster joining another    cluster .",
    "the three physical parameters present in the model are concentration @xmath23 , shear rate @xmath24 and `` temperature '' @xmath22 .",
    "simple shear flow is galilean invariant , by which we mean that adding a constant velocity at every point in the system has no effect on the physics .",
    "it is therefore desirable that any model of simple shear is as close as possible to being galilean invariant .",
    "we discuss this issue in section [ sec : issues ] where we show that lattice effects break galilean invariance in the model .",
    "in addition , we remark that the model is translationally invariant only in the direction of flow .",
    "the fixed walls break translational invariance normal to the direction of flow .",
    "from computer simulation of the model defined in section [ sec : model ] , we have found two types of steady state .",
    "the first is an unjammed state , where many small clusters are evenly distributed throughout the system .",
    "a snapshot of a typical unjammed system is shown in figure [ fig : unjammed ] .",
    "there are some clusters which are elongated perpendicular to the direction of flow but the typical cluster size is very small .",
    "a second type of steady state exhibited by the model is characterised by the presence of clusters which span the system ; we refer to it as `` jammed '' state ( although the spanning cluster is not stationary ) .",
    "these _ spanning clusters _ contain a finite fraction of the particles in the system .",
    "a snapshot of a typical jammed system is shown in figure [ fig : jammed ] ; the system is strongly inhomogeneous in a number of respects .",
    "since the spanning cluster is moving with a velocity close to that of the particles in the centre of the channel , the rate of aggregation is least in the centre and greatest at the walls  near the upper wall , small clusters move more quickly than the spanning cluster and join it from behind whereas near the lower wall , small clusters move more slowly than the spanning cluster and aggregate from the front . hence the spanning cluster is aligned at an angle to the direction of flow and decreases in thickness from the edges to the centre of the channel .",
    "accordingly , the density in the rest of the system is greatest in the centre and least at the edges .",
    "some quite large clusters are visible close to the spanning cluster ",
    "these are probably pieces of the spanning cluster which broke off some short time previously .",
    "the somewhat unusual , inhomogeneous nature of the jammed steady state in the finite systems we study is primarily a result of having hard wall boundaries parallel to the direction of flow rather than any effect of the underlying square lattice .    in order to discuss the behaviour of the model more quantitatively",
    ", we introduce the cluster size distribution @xmath25 , the number of clusters containing @xmath26 particles at time @xmath27 .",
    "the moments @xmath28 of the cluster size distribution are given by @xmath29 so that @xmath30 , the number of particles in the system and @xmath31 is the number of clusters in the system .",
    "we define @xmath32 as measures of typical cluster size @xcite for @xmath33 . in discussing steady state properties of the system",
    ", we use the average cluster size @xmath34 as our measure of typical cluster size since this quantity is not dominated by the spanning clusters in jammed systems . in contrast , for @xmath35 , @xmath36 is of the order of the size of a spanning cluster in the jammed state .",
    "we use @xmath37 when discussing the kinetics of jamming in section [ sec : kinetics ] .",
    "we now provide evidence of a strong discontinuous phase transition between jammed and unjammed states as the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath24 are varied .",
    "figure [ fig : ng1 ] shows a plot of @xmath38 against @xmath24 .",
    "strong hysteresis is apparent , with the direction of the hysteresis loop shown by the arrows . as @xmath24",
    "is increased from zero , @xmath38 increases smoothly at first but jumps discontinuously to a larger value , corresponding to a jammed system .",
    "when @xmath24 is then decreased , the jammed state remains stable ( for at least @xmath39 time - steps ) for a range of @xmath24 values in which an unjammed state is also stable ( for at least @xmath40 time - steps ) .",
    "the system becomes unjammed again for sufficiently small @xmath24 ( _ i.e. _ an initially jammed configuration becomes unstable ) .",
    "one can also see from figure [ fig : ng1 ] that , for jammed systems , @xmath38 increases roughly linearly with increasing shear rate .",
    "similar behaviour is found when @xmath22 is varied with @xmath24 and @xmath23 held fixed .",
    "figure [ fig : nt1 ] shows a log - log plot of @xmath38 against @xmath22 . as in figure [ fig : ng1 ] , strong hysteresis is apparent .",
    "there is a large range of values of @xmath22 for which both unjammed and jammed states are stable ( on a time - scale of at least @xmath41 time - steps for jammed systems and at least @xmath40 time - steps for unjammed systems . )",
    "figure [ fig : dist - ss ] shows a log - log plot of the steady state cluster size distribution @xmath42 for both unjammed and jammed systems at the same value of @xmath43 . in the homogenous system",
    ", @xmath42 decays very rapidly and the large @xmath26 behaviour appears to be exponential ( it decays faster than any power law ) . in the jammed system",
    ", the size distribution of small ( non - spanning ) clusters only is shown ; the distribution as a whole is bimodal , with the second peak ( not shown ) corresponding to the spanning cluster .",
    "the figure suggests that for the small clusters , @xmath42 decays as a power of @xmath26 ( for @xmath26 greater than about @xmath44 ) with an exponent close to @xmath45 .",
    "however , @xmath42 decays faster than a power law for @xmath26 greater than about @xmath46 .",
    "it is not clear whether this is a finite system - size effect or the true asymptotic behaviour . for jammed systems ,",
    "the situation is further complicated by the fact that the cluster size distribution is spatially inhomogeneous ( see figure [ fig : jammed ] ) .",
    "we have found two different regimes of behaviour in the jammed state as @xmath22 is varied .",
    "figure [ fig : mvt ] shows the variation of @xmath38 with time in the ( jammed ) steady state with @xmath47 ( the other parameters are the same as for figure [ fig : nt1 ] ) .",
    "the average cluster size @xmath38 appears to fluctuate about a value close to @xmath48 for some time before increasing suddenly to more than @xmath49 ; it then gradually falls back to about @xmath48 .",
    "we have found that this behaviour is due to splitting and reforming of the spanning cluster .",
    "we have already seen in figure [ fig : jammed ] that a spanning cluster is narrowest at its centre . if @xmath22 is sufficiently small , the spanning cluster does not split .",
    "however , when @xmath22 is sufficiently large the spanning cluster may split in two , whereupon the two resulting clusters separate . at this point ,",
    "the two large clusters grow by aggregating with smaller clusters before meeting again and reforming the spanning cluster ( due to the periodic boundary in the flow direction ) . upon reforming ,",
    "the spanning cluster is larger ( it contains more particles ) than when it split ; this is because the two large clusters formed as a result of the split grow significantly before recombining .",
    "this explains the sudden rises in average cluster size seen in figure [ fig : mvt ] .",
    "the newly reformed spanning cluster gradually loses particles before splitting once more .",
    "the steady state is cyclic  a spanning cluster is stable only in the sense that once it splits , it always reforms .",
    "close examination of figure [ fig : nt1 ] reveals a kink in the jammed branch of @xmath50 around @xmath47 .",
    "this is caused by the change in behaviour from a non - cyclic steady state to a cyclic one .",
    "if @xmath22 is further increased beyond about @xmath51 , the two large clusters formed when a spanning cluster splits may become unstable and break up ( due to fragmentation dominating shear - induced aggregation ) .",
    "an unjammed system then results and there is no longer a jammed steady state .",
    "it is not clear to what extent the splitting of spanning clusters is affected by system size .",
    "the above concludes our discussion of the steady state properties of the model ; we now consider the approach to the steady state when the system spontaneously jams from an initial condition of particles positioned at random .",
    "figure [ fig : jamming ] shows a snapshot of a system in the process of jamming 7000 time - steps after the particles were positioned at random . clusters with a large range of sizes are visible .",
    "we define the gel time @xmath52 as the time at which a spanning cluster first appears in the system .",
    "santra and herrmann @xcite found ( by extrapolation ) that , for @xmath53 , @xmath52 is finite for an infinite system .",
    "figure [ fig : tgel ] shows a plot of @xmath52 against @xmath22 for different system sizes .",
    "it appears that as system size is increased for the fixed aspect ratio @xmath54 , @xmath55 converges .",
    "a fit to the data for the @xmath56 system indicated that @xmath52 increases more quickly than @xmath57 and it is possible that it diverges for some finite value of @xmath22 ; this is consistent with the presence of a phase transition at finite @xmath22 . however , due to the large amount of computational effort required to obtain @xmath55 , we have been unable to confirm this unambiguously .",
    "also , figure [ fig : tgel ] shows that @xmath52 depends on the aspect ratio of the system since @xmath52 for the @xmath58 system is consistently smaller than for the @xmath56 system .    in a gelling system",
    ", we expect the pre - gelation cluster size distribution to have the scaling form @xcite @xmath59 for large cluster sizes , with the typical cluster size @xmath60 , given by ( [ eqn : def - s ] ) , diverging as @xmath61 .",
    "since the number of particles @xmath11 is conserved , we must have @xmath62 . the above scaling _ ansatz _",
    "is expected to apply for an infinite system . in our finite systems , we find evidence of such scaling for @xmath63 although finite - size effects are large .",
    "figure [ fig : timedist ] shows a log - log plot of @xmath42 for @xmath64 at four different times ( note that the curves have been shifted vertically for clarity ) .",
    "power law behaviour appears gradually and is present over the largest range of cluster sizes at @xmath65 .",
    "we define @xmath66 to be the time at which we see power law behaviour of @xmath42 over the maximum range of @xmath26 .",
    "by @xmath67 , spanning clusters have formed and a `` bump '' has begun to form in the tail of the distribution . by fitting a power law to the @xmath42 for large @xmath26 at @xmath68 , we find the exponent @xmath69 .",
    "since for an infinite system @xmath70 must be greater than 2 , we conclude that finite - size effects are strong .",
    "indeed , this is not surprising since we find , for @xmath71 , that @xmath72 ( as expected in gelling systems ) so that there are clusters with size of order the system size present at time @xmath66 .",
    "however , for @xmath73 and @xmath74 we find that @xmath66 is somewhat smaller than @xmath52 , an anomaly which we are unable to explain but which may be due to finite - size effects .",
    "figure [ fig : sizedist ] shows log - log plots of @xmath42 at @xmath66 for several values of @xmath22 . a power law cluster size distribution ( for @xmath26 larger than about 10 ) is present for all values of @xmath22 .",
    "the slopes of the power law regions decrease with increasing @xmath22 ( for @xmath75 ) , suggesting that the exponent @xmath70 varies significantly with @xmath22 and hence that it may be non - universal .",
    "futher careful study of finite - size effects would be required to clarify this point .",
    "the `` counter '' scheme @xcite for performing cluster flow described in section [ sec : model ] is not the only one that can be imagined .",
    "however , we have found that it has important advantages over other schemes .",
    "for example , a simpler way of implementing cluster motion in the direction of flow is , at each time - step , to let each cluster move forward one site with probability @xmath76 , where @xmath76 is the velocity of the cluster .",
    "however , there are seemingly insurmountable difficulties with this stochastic implementation of cluster flow . to illustrate this point ,",
    "let us consider how clusters aggregate and grow .",
    "aggregation occurs when one cluster catches up with a slower neighbouring cluster .",
    "we wish the imposed shear to be the dominant factor in the aggregation . however , if clusters move forward stochastically , as in the scheme just described , fluctuations ( in addition to the imposed velocity gradient ) will cause clusters to aggregate . for example , a cluster with velocity @xmath77 may may move forward in several successive time - steps at the same time as a cluster with velocity @xmath78 does not move at all , possibly resulting in the spurious aggregation of the clusters .",
    "indeed , we have found that when the stochastic implementation of cluster flow just described is used ( instead of the counter scheme described in section [ sec : model ] ) , stochastic aggregation of clusters dominates aggregation due to the imposed shear for practical parameter values .",
    "a further advantage of the counter dynamics for flow is that it is much closer to being galilean invariant than a stochastic implementation of cluster flow .",
    "this is because , for stochastic flow , the size of the fluctuations in the motion of a cluster , and hence the rate of cluster - cluster aggregation , is strongly dependent on the absolute magnitude of the velocity @xmath3 .",
    "it is well - known that the variance of the displacement of an independent random walker hopping in one direction with probability per time - step @xmath76 is proportional to @xmath79 ; we therefore expect the rate of cluster - cluster aggregation for stochastic cluster flow to be greatest for @xmath80 and smallest for @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "we have confirmed that this is indeed the case in simulations .",
    "this is a potentially serious problem in simulation of a shear flow since @xmath76 varies across the width of the lattice .",
    "since the counter implementation of cluster flow is deterministic , the problems peculiar to stochastic cluster flow just discussed are circumvented .",
    "the counter scheme is , however , not without its limitations .",
    "figure [ fig : n - spatial ] shows the average cluster size of clusters whose centre of mass lies in lane @xmath5 as a function of @xmath3 for two unjammed systems with different concentrations .",
    "the average cluster size is smallest for @xmath83 and @xmath84 due to the presence of the fixed walls .",
    "however , the cluster size grows quite slowly as one moves in from either wall and we have checked that the reason for this is that @xmath76 is in the vicinity of either @xmath6 or @xmath85 .",
    "similarly , a deep minimum in the average cluster size is evident around @xmath86 , with less pronounced minima also evident around @xmath87 , _",
    "etc_. clearly , the counter updating scheme has a systematic effect on the cluster - cluster aggregation rate , breaking galilean invariance by introducing a velocity dependence of the cluster - cluster aggregation rate .",
    "not surprisingly , the effect diminishes as @xmath23 is decreased . in our simulations , we have attempted to minimise the effect of the spatial inhomogeneity caused by the updating scheme by working at low concentration and avoiding velocities less than @xmath88 or greater than @xmath89 . for the concentration values we have used ( @xmath90 ) ,",
    "it is clear that the shear is the dominant factor driving cluster - cluster aggregation since the average cluster size varies significantly with shear rate ( see figure [ fig : ng1 ] ) .",
    "it is clear that lattice models are not ideally suited to the simulation of a galilean invariant phenomenon such as shear - induced aggregation , although they are a relatively simple and efficient approach to the problem .",
    "however , there are physical situations where galilean invariance is not respected , an example being ( multi - lane ) traffic flow where the concept of being `` at rest '' is absolutely defined .",
    "indeed , lattice models of multi - lane traffic flow have recently been studied @xcite .",
    "the present model could be interpreted as a multilane flow in which vehicles can not pass one another without an empty lane being present between them as they do so . however , the rules adopted for determining cluster velocities would themselves then have to be chosen non - galilean - invariant ( a cluster would travel only as fast as its slowest member ) .",
    "apart from rotation effects @xcite , the presence or absence of galilean invariance is ( arguably ) the major difference between colloidal and vehicular jamming .    in summary , the counter scheme @xcite is a deterministic way of implementing cluster flow which circumvents some of the difficulties associated with a stochastic implementation of cluster flow .",
    "in addition , it only allows single step movements of clusters and thus avoids potential problems associated with collisions of clusters and double occupancy of sites .",
    "in this work we have studied a simple stochastic model of shear - induced clustering on a @xmath0 lattice .",
    "our results strongly suggest that a discontinuous transition occurs , with strong hysteresis , from an unjammed state to a jammed state as the shear rate is increased or temperature decreased . as the system jams",
    ", the distribution of clusters becomes power law .",
    "however , the exponent may have a non - trivial temperature dependence , appearing to vary continuously .",
    "our conclusions are based on the study of finite systems and , while we have presented strong evidence in favour of the presence of a discontinuous phase transition in the model , care is required in identifying such a phase transition @xcite .",
    "it would be useful therefore to study systematically finite - size effects in the system , as well as the effect of varying the aspect ratio . also , we have not considered rotation of clusters but it should be possible to do so following ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to compare the present transition to several other models of reversible cluster - cluster aggregation in which the aggregation is due to diffusion of clusters , rather than an imposed shear . in the conserved - mass aggregation model of krishnamurthy _",
    "@xcite a transition from a disordered ( unjammed ) phase to a phase containing an infinite cluster occurs as the rate of single particle dissociation increases .",
    "the infinite aggregate phase exhibits a power law cluster size distribution .",
    "however , in contrast to the present model , the transition in that work is reminiscent of bose condensation and does not exhibit hysteresis .",
