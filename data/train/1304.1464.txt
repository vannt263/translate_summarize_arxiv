    "as stars evolve from pre - main sequence ( pms ) to the main sequence and then to post - main sequence , their luminosity evolves considerably . for a 1 solar mass star , at the beginning of the pms",
    "the luminosity is as high as 10 solar luminosities .",
    "a few million years later the luminosity decreases to a minimum of @xmath2 0.4 solar luminosities , then it gradually rises to @xmath2 3 @xmath3 towards the end of the main sequence , and it reaches a peak of more than a thousand @xmath3 at the tip of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) . as a consequence of the evolution of the luminosity of a star , the location and the width of the habitable zone around the star also changes .",
    "the habitable zone is defined to be an annulus or shell around the star in which liquid water can exist ( kasting , whitmire , and reynolds 1993 ) . for exoplanets located within the habitable zone the chance for life to develop depends on the length of time of its transit or its duration .    in the past few years , the discovery of the planetary system around the nearby m dwarf , gl581 ( udry et al . 2007 , mayor et al .",
    "2009 , vogt et al .",
    "2010 ) , has generated increased interest and study of exoplanetary habitability because two of its exoplanets gl581c and gl581d are potentially habitable super - earths .",
    "calculations of selsis et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and von bloh ( 2007 ) have shown that gl581c is likely to be too close to its host star to be habitable and likely would suffer from a runaway greenhouse effect like venus . on the other hand , gl581d , with a minimum mass of about 7 @xmath4 could be a habitable super - earth if it had a minimum partial pressure of about 7 bar of @xmath5 with a total surface pressure of about 7.6 bar ( kaltenegger et al .",
    "similar conclusions concerning the habitability of gl581d have been reached in studies by wordsworth et al .",

    "a broader study of habitability of exoplanets is presented in the recent review paper by lammer et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , who examined the important factors relevant to the evolution and habitability of earth - like planets , including radiation and particle fluxes , geophysical environments and processes such as plate tectonics , the origin and evolution of life and its observability .    at the present time ,",
    "we do not know whether life evolved quickly  within a few million or a hundred million years  or much longer  up to a billion years , due to the difficulty of searching so far back into the earth s fossil record . life on earth could have been created and have evolved quickly , but could have been destroyed and then restarted during the period of late - heavy bombardment .",
    "isotopic data have shown that life existed as early as @xmath6 years after the earth was formed ( mojzsis et al .",
    "1997 , holland 1997 ) . assuming that life evolved on the earth on a relatively short time scale , lineweaver and davis ( 2002 ) calculated that the probability of biogenesis around other planets could be @xmath113% ( 95% confidence level ) for exoplanets in the habitable zones of their host stars , if they are older than 1 gyr .",
    "these authors use this statistical result to infer that life in the universe may be common . in a paper with results complementary to those of lineweaver and davis ( 2002 ) , davies ( 2003 )",
    "hypothesizes that the rapid development of life on earth could be due to a non - terrestrial origin , if life requires one or several improbable or `` hard '' steps , as discussed by carter ( 1983 , 2008 ) and hanson ( 1998 ) .",
    "davies ( 2003 ) suggests that life could have developed on mars and then transported to earth , but is likely not of extrasolar origin .",
    "the hard - step scenario for the evolution of intelligent life discussed in hanson ( 1998 ) and carter ( 2008 ) yields estimates for the mean time interval between the key steps .",
    "the number of steps discussed in the literature varies between two ( carter 1983 ) and ten ( barrow & tipler 1986 ) , and the mean interval between steps can be interpreted in the context of major evolutionary stages , such as biogenesis , bacterial , eukaryotes , combigenesis , metazoans , and civilization ( carter 2008 ) .",
    "the boundary between the oxygen - poor archean eon and the oxygen - medium proterozoic eon is at the third step , the eurokaryotes , which occurred around 2.3 gyr ago .",
    "the mean interval between steps is estimated to be about 0.8 gyr ( carter 2008 ) .",
    "these two time intervals have observational consequences .    by studying the evolution of the habitable zone around stars of different masses , metallicities , and evolutionary states we have the possibility of empirically determining the time scale for life formation , at least in the sense of learning the time scale for life to affect the composition of the atmosphere of an exoplanet .",
    "observationally it is well established that exoplanets with masses larger than neptune mass ( i.e. , gas giants ) are detected more frequently around higher - than - solar metallicity stars in the solar neighborhood from radial velocity surveys ( fischer and valenti , 2005 ; sousa et al .",
    "however , this correlation does not appear to exist for lower mass exoplanets as shown recently by transit observations from kepler ( buchhave et al .",
    "2012 ) . in this case",
    "the distribution is approximately constant with metallicity for host stars with [ fe / h ] = @xmath70.5 to @xmath80.5 .",
    "the correlation of gas giant exoplanets with high metallicity host stars supports the core accretion model of planet formation because their primordial disks are expected to have more rocky planetesimals from which the rocky cores of gas giants are formed ( ida & lin et al .",
    "recently , attention has been given to the effect of metallicity on the habitable zones around cool dwarfs with masses @xmath9 with kepler objects of interest ( muirhead et al .",
    "2012 ) and the effect of abundance ratios of metals other than fe in the evolution of the habitable zones around 1 @xmath10 stars ( young , liebst , and pagano 2012 ) .",
    "transit spectroscopy has been employed to characterize the physical conditions of exoplanets , including the discovery of a variety of molecular species around some close - in exoplanets ( deming et al .",
    "2005 , richardson et al .",
    "2007 ) . in the long run ,",
    "imaging techniques such as coronagraphy at optical wavelengths and interferometry in the mid - infrared can be used in connection with spectroscopy to characterize the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets , not just transiting systems , which comprise only a few percent of observable systems .",
    "research on the location and time scales for habitability around stars as they evolve from the main sequence has continued since the early work of lopez et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , who first considered the search for planets and the location of the habitable zone around red giant branch and asymptotic giant branch stars in the context of the darwin mission . later , stern ( 2003 ) discussed the evolution of the habitable zone of 1 - 3 @xmath10 stars in the context of the possibility habitability of outer solar system bodies during the rgb and agb phases , when the stars are at their luminosity peak .    in a previous paper ( lopez , schneider , &",
    "danchi 2005 ) , hereafter paper i , we studied the evolution of the habitable zone around stars of 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 @xmath10 from the main sequence until the first ascent along the red giant branch ( rgb ) for solar metallicity stars using the evolutionary tracks of maeder and meynet ( 1988 ) . in paper i",
    "we showed that there is a second chance for life as a star evolves off the main sequence , because this evolution is very slow , particularly for stars near 1 @xmath10 .",
    "if life could develop and evolve over time scales from about @xmath11 to @xmath12 years , then there could be habitable planets around red giant stars .",
    "for a 1 @xmath10 star , the duration of habitability was estimated to be @xmath12 years at 2 au and around @xmath13 years at 9 au .",
    "this gives a second chance for life in the far distant future for planets such as mars , which is currently too cold for liquid water to exist on its surface . in this paper",
    "we review and show that after the first ascent along the rgb and the he flash , there is an additional period of time in which the luminosity is very stable , i.e. , the core he burning phase , which can last a few times @xmath13 years or perhaps up to @xmath12 years .",
    "during the core he burning phase there is also a potential for long duration habitability at distances of 7 to 22 au .",
    "more recently , von bloh et al . (",
    "2009 ) considered the evolution of the habitable zone and the duration of habitability , including not only the luminosity evolution of the host star but also the evolution of the atmospheric content of the planet itself , e.g. including the greenhouse effect and other processes .",
    "the effects they included increased the habitable zone width by a small amount . in the end ,",
    "their results were quite similar to our own in terms of the duration of habitability as a star evolves off the main sequence .",
    "in the present paper we show also that metallicity plays an important role in the evolution of the habitable zone .",
    "stars having significantly higher - than - solar metallicity have a much longer duration of habitability at a given distance than do stars of lower than solar metallicity .",
    "the difference in luminosity means that high metallicity stars have habitable zones that are closer to the star than do low metallicity stars .",
    "thus strategies for the detection of life are strongly affected by the location of the habitable zone because all direct exoplanet detection and atmospheric characterization impose some specific requirements in terms of spatial resolution .",
    "for example , direct imaging techniques such as coronagraphy or interferometry are affected by their inner working angles ( iwas ) , which depend on the diameter of a telescope or the baseline of an interferometer , respectively .",
    "for these instruments , the iwa defines a minimum angular scale such that their performance is degraded for angles smaller than the iwa . for a coronagraph ,",
    "the iwa scales as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the wavelength of light , and @xmath16 is the telescope diameter . for an interferometer , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the baseline of the interferometer .",
    "an exoplanet at 1 au around a sun - like star at 10 pc is at an angular separation of 100 mas .",
    "this requires a telescope of diameter 3 m at 0.5 @xmath19 m or an interferometer with a baseline of 10 m. a thorough review of direct imaging of exoplanet techniques is presented in the review by traub and oppenheimer ( 2010 ) , and community consensus reports on the state of the art of these techniques and future prospects are in chapters 3 and 4 on optical and infrared imaging , respectively , in the exoplanet community report edited by lawson , traub , and unwin ( 2009 ) .",
    "the present paper is built on our previous results , and it discusses pms evolution as well as evolution after the first ascent on the rgb including the core - he burning phase all the way up to the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "we present these results for stars with solar metallicity having initial masses of 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 @xmath10 . for the pms evolution",
    "we use the tracks from tognelli et al .",
    "( 2011 ) .",
    "for those same initial masses we also calculated the evolution of the habitable zone over a wide range of metallicities .",
    "this time we started the evolution near the zero age main sequence .",
    "as discussed above , we follow the evolution along the main sequence up to the rgb , then through the core he burning phase all the way to the tip of the agb .",
    "we used a grid of five metallicities , z=0.0001 , 0.001 , 0.017 ( close to solar ) , 0.040 , and 0.070 .",
    "we used a helium abundance of y=0.26 for all cases except for the highest metallicity , z=0.070 , where we used y=0.30 . for our calculations we used the main sequence and post - main sequence tracks available from girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and bertelli et al .",
    "( 2008 ) .",
    "the pisa and padova tracks were chosen because the grid provided in the web sites covered the range of metallicities and masses of interest to this paper , and could be combined so that the luminosity evolution of a star from the pms to the agb could be consistently treated .",
    "the tracks for z=0.017 and y=0.26 , which we call `` near - solar metallicity '' in this paper , were the  solar \" abundance tracks based on the historical standard solar composition ( see the review by grevesse and sauval 1998 ) . in the past few years",
    "the initial metallicity of the sun has been revised downwards to z=0.015 ( lodders 2003 ) .",
    "the more recent value does not affect the results of this paper .    in this paper",
    "we isolate the effect of metallicity on the evolution of the habitable zone by keeping the initial helium abundance , y , a constant except at the highest metallicity value , z=0.070 , rather than using the helium enrichment law : @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the primordial helium abundance .",
    "the helium enrichment law @xmath22 has been measured using eclipsing binaries ( ribas et al . 2000 ) , giving @xmath22 = 2.2 @xmath23 0.8 with @xmath21 = 0.225 @xmath23 0.013 , k dwarfs in the hipparchos catalog with spectroscopically determined metallicities ( jimenez et al .",
    "2003 ) resulted in @xmath22 = 2.1 @xmath23 0.4 , and field k dwarfs ( casagrande et al .",
    "2007 ) , giving @xmath22 = 2.1 @xmath23 0.9 .",
    "if we adopt the most recent values for the enrichment law @xmath22 = 2.1 @xmath23 0.9 , we find that for z=0.040 , y could be as low as 0.27 or as high as 0.31 .",
    "these values are approximately within the spread of the measurements , as can be seen in figure 7 of ribas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which show z values near 0.015 have y values between 0.20 and 0.29 .",
    "given the large uncertainties in the helium enrichment law and the large spread in values of the initial helium abundance , it is reasonable to keep its value fixed except at the highest value of z considered in this paper , where a larger value is clearly needed .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 discusses the methodology employed in the computations and section 3 covers the evolution of the habitable zone from the pms to the agb for 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 @xmath10 stars .",
    "following this , in section 4 we describe our results on the effect of metallicity on the evolution of the habitable zone for a grid of five metallicities using a simple formulation for the equilibrium temperature of the exoplanet .",
    "next , in section 5 , we calculate the evolution of the habitable zone using a more refined estimate for the inner and outer boundaries of the habitable zone , and we compare these results to the simpler formulation .",
    "the connection between the initial metallicity parameter z and the observable metallicity [ fe / h ] is explored in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we discuss the implications of our results on the search for life , and we present a summary of our findings in section 8 .",
    "we follow the methodology of paper i , in which the temperature of a planet at a chosen distance from its host star is computed as a function of time based on the luminosity evolution of the star . as the star evolves and the luminosity changes , the inner and outer boundaries of the habitable zone also change .",
    "a planet is considered habitable if its equilibrium temperature is within the range defined by the allowed temperature extremes . in this paper",
    "we use an equilibrium temperature of 269 k for the inner boundary of the habitable zone and 169 k for the equilibrium temperature at the outer boundary of the habitable zone . for the sun ,",
    "these extremes become 0.95 au and 2.4 au , respectively .",
    "a more conservative limit for the equilibrium temperature of the outer boundary of the habitable zone is 203 k , which corresponds to 1.67 au ( forget 1998 ) .",
    "these values assume the planet s bond albedo is 0.2 as in paper i.    the temperature of a planet is calculated based on the equilibrium between the amount of stellar radiation that is absorbed by the planet to the amount that is radiated by the planet back into space .",
    "we use a greybody approximation in which the radiative properties of the planet are described by only a single parameter ",
    "the planet s albedo , @xmath24 .",
    "it is further assumed that the planet has perfect heat conductivity so that its temperature is uniform across its surface .",
    "thus , the planet s temperature , @xmath25 is : @xmath26 } ^{1/4 } , \\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the luminosity of the star , @xmath28 the distance from the star to the planet , and @xmath29 is the stefan - boltzmann constant . for the calculations in this paper we assume a slightly higher bond albedo of 0.3 , which is earth s average bond albedo ( de pater & lissauer 2001 ) .",
    "since the assumed albedo is a constant and thus wavelength independent , terms due to the albedo cancel out in the calculation .",
    "unlike paper i we consider only the less conservative limit for the temperature of the outer boundary of the habitable zone ( 169 k ) , which gives the longest possible durations of habitability .",
    "the conservative limit for the temperature of the outer boundary of the habitable zone ( 203 k ) was discussed in paper i and it was based on forget ( 1998 ) .",
    "this temperature limit gives an outer habitable zone distance of 1.67 au for a star like the sun , and an albedo , @xmath30 ( paper i ) , or 1.58 au for @xmath31 ( this paper ) .",
    "the outer limit is set by the lowest temperature at which the liquid - solid phase change of water can occur , which depends on the existence of a greenhouse effect from @xmath32 and @xmath33 ( kasting et al .",
    "1993 , kasting 1998 ) .",
    "the less conservative temperature limit of 169 k , which corresponds to a distance of 2.4 au ( @xmath30 ) or 2.27 au ( @xmath31 ) for a star like the sun , is based on planetary atmosphere models that included @xmath32 ice clouds .",
    "atmospheres with optically thick @xmath32 ice clouds with large particle radii ( 6 - 8 @xmath19 m ) can maintain the surface of a planet above the freezing point of water ( forget & pierrehumbert 1997 , mischna et al .",

    "the pisa tracks started at the earliest pms phase of core collapse at about @xmath36 years and ran to @xmath37 years .",
    "these tracks were compared to those from the padova group .",
    "the two sets of tracks produced luminosities within a few percent of each other over the time periods that overlapped .",
    "composite tracks were generated from the pms to the agb by concatenating the two sets of tracks together were they closely matched .",
    "we used the pisa tracks from the pms up to 20 , 40 , and 80 million years for 1.0 , 1.5 , and 2.0 @xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we scaled the luminosities from these tracks to match the padova tracks at those times , and generated a complete track by concatenating the two sets of tracks together into one file for each stellar mass selected .",
    "the luminosities for these tracks also were within a few percent of the pisa tracks , and a complete track was created in the manner described above .",
    "core he burning tracks from the padova group were then concatenated with the composite tracks previously created .    for the he flash we adopted a short and not significant duration",
    "compared to the habitability conditions we are evaluating of @xmath36 years , between the end of the first ascent along the rgb and the zero age of the core he burning phase .",
    "the duration of the he flash adopted is consistent with the results of numerical simulations of the he flash performed by dearborn , lattanzio , and eggleton ( 2006 ) .",

    "the peak is still broader and is from 4 to 9 au .",

    "these relations for the inner and outer boundaries of the habitable zone take into account the radiative properties of the atmosphere of the planet by adding correction factors based on the difference in the effective temperature of the star compared to that of the sun .",

    "we fix l to be equal to solar luminosity , and we derive the fractional change in the inner and outer radii of the habitable zone , based on @xmath60 0.90 au , and @xmath61 2.27 au using the albedo a=0.3 used throughout this paper . with this scaling",
    "we isolate the effect of the terms in the equations depending on the parameter @xmath62 .",
    "the upper panel displays the fractional correction to the inner ( solid line ) and outer ( dashed line ) boundaries of the habitable zone . for the inner boundary ,",
    "the corrections are about @xmath84% at 3700 k and @xmath75% at 7200 k , while the outer boundary corrections are at the @xmath810% and @xmath79% levels for 3700 k and 7200 k , respectively . based on this analysis the width of the habitable zone",

    "the bottom panel of figure 13 displays the fractional correction to the width of the habitable zone as a function of the effective temperature of the star .",
    "note that the effect is at the @xmath815% level for the lowest effective temperature and @xmath79% at the highest effective temperature considered .",
    "[ fig11 ]    these improved estimates of the inner and outer boundaries of the habitable zone may have implications for the duration of the habitable zone . in the remainder of this section",
    "we explore their applicability and implications in terms of the duration of the habitable zone .",

    "we find that these equations are applicable for 1 @xmath10 stars for all the metallicities considered and for 1.5 @xmath10 stars for solar and higher metallicities .",
    "note that the effective temperature of the 1.5 @xmath10 star is barely outside of the limits of the equations , so we apply them to this case for completeness .",
    "[ fig13 ]    the main implication of these equations is that @xmath57 and @xmath58 give slightly different values for the inner and outer boundaries of the habitable zone than using an equilibrium temperature for the planet based only on the luminosity of the star .",
    "figure 13 displays the results for a 1 @xmath10 star . during the pms phase ,",
    "the inner boundary of the habitable zone is about a hundredth of an au further than for the simpler estimate , and the outer boundary is almost an au further out , i.e. , from nearly an au at @xmath36 years and down to a fraction of an au at @xmath39 years .",
    "it is clear that there is no significant difference in the location of the habitable zone during the main sequence as the curves lie on top of each other .",
    "figure 14 displays the effect of the improved formulae for the late main sequence and post main sequence phases .",
    "we see that as in the pms phases , the locations of the inner and outer boundaries move outward only fractions of an au .",
