    "one of the most interesting topics within modern condensed matter physics is that of phenomena in reduced dimensionality , resulting from some degree of spatial localization of the particles comprising a system.@xcite for example , chemists , materials scientists and physicists have created and explored numerous physical systems in which atoms and molecules are confined within quasi - one dimensional ( q1d ) environments .",
    "the variety of these systems is remarkable , such as the peapod geometry , _ i.e. _ , a line of buckyballs within a carbon nanotube,@xcite fluids within artificial materials created by templating @xcite and q1d optical lattices created by laser fields.@xcite unfortunately , as far as we know , there exists no comprehensive review of this general problem , although many relevant subfields have been summarized.@xcite the present paper addresses a small subset of this exciting research field .",
    "specifically , we consider problems involving fluids , both classical and quantum , confined within q1d channels , the focus of our group s research during the last decade.@xcite    here , the term q1d refers to a system in which particles move in an external potential field @xmath0 which is either constant or slowly varying in _ one _ direction ( @xmath1 ) , while @xmath2(*r * ) is strongly localizing in the two other ( transverse ) directions . in the case of quantum particles , for which the transverse spectrum is discrete , one expects that the corresponding degrees of freedom are frozen out at low temperature ( @xmath3 ) ; transverse excitation does occur at higher @xmath3 , as determined by the gaps in the transverse spectrum of states .",
    "this plausible expectation is borne out in some cases , but we shall see that there can be dramatic consequences of the transverse degrees of freedom in other cases , even at low @xmath3 .",
    "one of the many exciting aspects of strictly 1d physics is its susceptibility to weak perturbations .",
    "the reason for this behavior arises from the fact that ( in all practical situations)@xcite no phase transition can exist in a purely 1d system at any finite @xmath3 , even though the ground state may exhibit symmetry - breaking order . thus , there do exist transitions at @xmath3 identically equal to zero .",
    "a familiar example is the 1d ising model , for which the correlation length and susceptibility both diverge as @xmath3 approaches 0 .    since the purely 1d system has no finite @xmath3 transition , what brings about more interesting behavior in the q1d case ? as discussed below , the difference can arise from considering a set of parallel 1d systems which are weakly coupled .",
    "alternatively , the behavior can happen because the system is only 1d insofar as the transverse dimensions are finite , unlike the length in the z direction , l , which achieves the thermodynamic limit ..... but the transverse dimensions _ are _ large enough to have an observable effect ( e.g. low energy gaps ) .",
    "a third , more surprising , origin of interesting phenomena is when the system is a collection of noninteracting 1d systems , with `` quenched '' heterogeneity , which are coupled to a particle bath , so they possess a common chemical potential .",
    "the next section discusses the conceptually and computationally simplest case of a q1d system : a low density , noninteracting gas within a single channel ; then , the solution of the one - particle schrdinger equation determines the physical behavior .",
    "section 3 considers the case of many _ interacting _ particles within a single channel ; such a problem is often used as a model for fluids within regular or irregular porous materials .",
    "section 4 considers the problem of q1d channels containing fluids that interact with one another as well as with fluids occupying other channels .",
    "our first problem is conceptually and calculationally simple : a low density gas confined within a q1d geometry ; nevertheless , it provides interesting , and sometimes surprising , results .",
    "one example that has been studied extensively is that of a gas inside single carbon nanotubes , _",
    "e.g. _ quantum fluids or the `` peapod '' case of c@xmath4 molecules.@xcite another is the case of quantum gases inside templated regular pores.@xcite a third example is the so - called groove region between two nanotubes , _",
    "e.g. _ on the outside of a bundle of nanotubes.@xcite    a _ classical _ noninteracting gas has a kinetic energy per particle of ( 3/2 ) @xmath5 and a mean potential energy @xmath6 determined by its interaction with the environment . for the case of a particle localized near the z axis within a channel , @xmath7 , due to two transverse directions of excitation .",
    "hence , the classical specific heat per particle is @xmath8_{classical } = ( 5/2 ) k_b$ ] . for a quantum gas , instead",
    ", the transverse degrees of freedom are frozen out at low @xmath3 , so one expects @xmath8_{quantum } = ( 1/2 ) k_b$ ] .",
    "the generalization to @xmath9 `` effective '' dimensions yields this expression for the dimensionless specific heat , @xmath10 , of a noninteracting boltzmann gas : @xmath11    fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_c ] shows experimental results for @xmath10 in the case of @xmath12he inside of fsm-16 , a material consisting of straight hexagonal pores of cross - sectional distance of order 2 to 3 nm , pre - coated with a thin film of @xmath13he . at the low densities shown here",
    ", the @xmath12he gas can be assumed to be noninteracting , although interaction effects appear at higher density.@xcite the behavior observed inside fsm-16 can be understood by analogy to calculations in fig . [",
    "fig : theor_c ] , for a noninteracting gas of @xmath13he within a carbon nanotube .",
    "note the overall similarity of these two figures .",

    "quantum statistical effects are omitted from the calculation . adapted from ref .",

    "[ fig : theor_c],@xcite one observes that the low @xmath3 limit is @xmath15 , corresponding to a 1d classical gas , as expected . at high @xmath3 , instead , the limit is @xmath16 ; this limit is interpreted as that of a 2d gas moving on the inner surface of the nanotube .",
    "the bump at intermediate @xmath3 is a general property found for spectra , such as that of the rigid rotor,@xcite for which the inter - level spacing increases with quantum number . in the present case , the relevant spectrum is that arising from the azimuthal kinetic energy , @xmath17 here @xmath18 is the azimuthal quantum number and @xmath19 is the radial coordinate , while @xmath20 is defined as a temperature characteristic of azimuthal excitation .",
    "the peak in the specific heat occurs at a temperature near 3 @xmath20 for both radii considered in fig .",
    "[ fig : theor_c ] , so its position serves as a benchmark from which one can determine the value of @xmath21 . note that inside a nanotube , the relevant value of @xmath21 is typically @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the gas - surface hard core interaction length . the key qualitative difference between the behaviors seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : exp_c ] and [ fig : theor_c ] is that the experimental data in fig .",
    "[ fig : exp_c ] plunge to @xmath24 as @xmath25 .",
    "this is an effect of quantum degeneracy , manifested in nernst s law , as found in explicit calculations which revise fig .",
    "[ fig : theor_c ] by taking quantum statistics into account.@xcite    there have been many theoretical studies of gas adsorption in the presence of nanotubes.@xcite in most treatments of these systems , one assumes that neighboring tubes are parallel . in that case , there exists a region of space- the so - called `` groove''- which is a 1d channel with a strongly attractive potential , created by the adjacent tubes .",
    "the adsorbed gas then exhibits q1d behavior at low @xmath26 .",
    "however , one can also inquire about the case when the tubes are not quite parallel , but instead diverge , leaving a particularly attractive region between them , with a minimum potential energy ( @xmath27 ) located at equilibrium position @xmath28 . in a forthcoming study,@xcite we will report remarkable results for this geometry , as exemplified in fig . [",
    "fig : groove_c ] .",
    "the low @xmath3 behavior is that of a gas in a 1d harmonic potential , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the force constant for particle motion parallel to the @xmath1 axis , midway between and nearly parallel to the tubes axes .",
    "we introduce the characteristic temperature for this motion , @xmath31 and a reduced temperature @xmath32 . for @xmath33 ,",
    "the specific heat is of arrhenius form , as seen in the figure , while for @xmath34 , @xmath35 , the specific heat of a 2d gas .",
    "that behavior might not have been anticipated , at first glance , because for small divergence half - angle @xmath36 , one might have expected 1d behavior , i.e. , @xmath37 .",
    "another surprise is the high @xmath38 limiting behavior , @xmath39 .",
    "this peculiar result arises because the relevant particles motions are those in the plane perpendicular to the @xmath40 plane of the nanotubes , for which the potential variation is unusual- proportional to @xmath41 .",
    "( solid - red ) and ne ( short - dashed - black ) between two nearly parallel nanotubes , each with @xmath42 nm , and a divergence half - angle @xmath43 degrees . from ref .",
    "from the perspective of phase transitions , a channel of finite width is a q1d system , so that no true thermodynamic singularities can occur .",
    "this means that many attempts to explore behavior in porous media with single channel models ( such as cylindrical and slit pores ) can not accurately describe phase transition behavior that is seen in genuinely 3d porous media",
    ". nevertheless , these models may provide good semiqualitative predictive power , sufficient for most purposes since the fully 3d geometry is not known .",
    "we have explored a variety of such models , with several different goals .",
    "these include assessing the accuracy of simplifying models , such as mean - field - theory ( mft ) and the use of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "both of these approximations are suspect , at first glance , due to the important role of fluctuations in 1d statistical physics .",
    "[ fig : isotherms ] presents adsorption isotherms for uptake in a single cylindrical pore , described by a lattice gas model.@xcite in this model , continuous space is discretized into adsorption sites , which may be either occupied or empty in any microstate of the system . in the specific model used here ,",
    "the set of sites ( within one transverse section ) consists of one axial site and seven `` cylindrical shell '' sites , corresponding to positions near the inner boundary of the nanotube .",
    "the ensemble of sites include an infinite sequence of such layers of eight sites .",
    "the energy of the system includes interactions between particles occupying these sites , plus interactions between particles and the substrate host .",
    "[ fig : isotherms ] compares ( numerically ) exact results with those obtained from mft .",
    "the results are quite similar , overall , given the highly expanded scale of reduced chemical potential ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "note that the spurious transition seen in mft ( at reduced temperature @xmath45 ) is not very different from the nearly discontinuous isotherm seen in the exact results .     as a function of the transverse interaction .",
    "perturbation theory results and predictions from the anisotropic lattice gas model are compared . from ref .",
    "consider a geometry consisting of a set of parallel q1d fluids , as in gases within or between nanotubes comprising a bundle of such tubes . while no transition can occur for an _ isolated _ q1d system , once coupling between such systems is present",
    ", a finite temperature transition can occur .",
    "[ fig : tc ] presents results for such a geometry.@xcite the critical temperature @xmath46 is shown as a function of the transverse coupling @xmath47 , for the case of buckyballs confined within parallel nanotubes . as indicated , rather similar results were obtained from exact solutions for a lattice - gas model and from a perturbation theory . in the latter case ,",
    "the unperturbed equation of state was the exact 1d result for a model with lennard - jones interactions between the buckyballs and the perturbation was the weak van der waals interaction between balls in adjacent tubes .    particularly striking in this figure",
    "is the singular behavior for small @xmath47 , as blown - up in the inset .",

    "the singular behavior reflects the divergent susceptibility of the 1d system at low t ; as the correlation length diverges , larger regions of fluid in adjacent channels are coupled , so increases rapidly with increasing @xmath51.the other notable result in this formula and the figure is that the characteristic energy and @xmath46 scale are given by the _ longitudinal _",
    "coupling , which is about 500 k for the peapod case , whereas naively one might have expected to be proportional to @xmath51 .",
