    "the interstellar medium ( ism ) gas in galaxies represents the raw material for star formation through cosmic time . with current instrumentation ,",
    "the most effective way to study this gas ( in its neutral , ionised and molecular phases ) is with absorption spectra towards bright , high redshift sources such as quasars and gamma - ray bursts ( e.g. rauch 1998 ; vreeswijk et al .",

    "1986 ; storrie - lombardi & wolfe 2000 ; ellison et al . 2001 ; peroux et al . 2003 ; rao , turnshek & nestor 2006 ) .",
    "there are now some 1000 dlas identified , with the largest haul coming from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2009 ; prochaska & wolfe 2009 ) .",
    "high resolution spectroscopic follow - up has yielded chemical abundances for over 200 dlas and sub - dlas ( e.g. prochaska et al . 2007a ; akerman et al .",
    "2005 ; dessauges - zavadsky , ellison & murphy 2009 ; meiring et al .",
    "these abundance measurements have been brought to bear on several issues of nucleosynthetic origin and enrichment mechanisms ( e.g. pettini et al .",

    "2011 ) .    despite this wealth of spectroscopic data ,",
    "surprisingly little is known about the optical emission properties ( such as morphologies and luminosities ) of dla and sub - dla galaxies . whilst there has been some success in imaging the host galaxies at low redshifts ( e.g. le brun et al .",
    "1997 ; chen & lanzetta 2003 ; chun et al .",
    "2010 ; rao et al .",

    "2001 ; weatherley et al . 2005 ; fynbo et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ; noterdaeme et al .",
    "2012 ) . to address the difficulty of detecting high redshift dla galaxies , several novel observing techniques have been initiated , such as imaging below the lyman limit of a higher redshift absorber or using integral field units ( omeara , chen & kaplan 2006 ; fumagalli et al . 2010 ; peroux et al .",
    "2011 ) . at least at lower redshifts , where the sample sizes are sufficient to draw general conclusions ,",
    "galaxies selected based on their  properties alone seem to represent a wide variety of galaxy morphologies and luminosities ( e.g. rao et al .",
    "2003 , 2011 ) .    ultimately , however , it is perhaps the physical conditions within the ism that may reveal more about the nature and processes in high redshift galaxies .",
    "there are a few promising avenues for making such measurements in dlas .",
    "for example , in cases where molecular hydrogen is detected ( e.g. ge & bechtold 1997 ; ledoux et al .",
    "2003 ; noterdaeme et al . 2008 ) the relative populations of the rotationally excited states can be used to constrain temperatures and densities in the ism ( e.g. srianand et al . 2005 ; noterdaeme et al . 2007 , 2010 ) .",
    "in cases where the background qso is radio - loud , an alternative measure of the temperature can be obtained through observations of the  line in absorption . in combination with the  column density ( measured from the  absorption profile ) , the optical depth yields the so - called spin temperature ( ) of the neutral gas . for the general case of multiple phases of neutral gas along the line of sight ( e.g. a cold phase with a kinetic temperature of @xmath11",
    "k and a warm phase with a kinetic temperature of @xmath12  k ; wolfire et al .",
    "2003 ) , the derived spin temperature gives the column density weighted harmonic mean of the spin temperatures of the multiple phases , and thus the distribution of neutral gas in different phases of the ism ( e.g. kanekar & briggs 2004 ) .",
    "since the detection of molecular hydrogen in dlas is biased towards the highest metallicity systems ( petitjean et al .",
    "2006 ; noterdaeme et al . 2008 ) , the use of spin temperatures is an appealing option for a more general overview of conditions in the neutral ism .    despite its promise ,",
    "the collection of spin temperature measurements in dlas has been fairly slow , with the first 25 years of absorption studies yielding only 10 detections in dlas at all redshifts , with only 3 detections at @xmath13 ( e.g. brown & roberts 1973 ; wolfe & davis 1979 ; wolfe , briggs & jauncey 1981 ; wolfe et al . 1985 ; lane et al . 1998 ; chengalur & kanekar 1999 ) . the primary reason for the lack of spin temperatures is the paucity of dlas at suitable redshifts in front of radio - loud qsos .",
    "moreover , the relatively narrow bandwidth of spectrometers has generally made blind  absorption surveys impractical .",
    "the last decade has seen notable improvement in  absorption statistics , due to progress on several fronts .",
    "first , optical spectroscopic surveys that include large numbers of qsos are now available to cross - correlate with all - sky radio surveys .",
    "this approach has led to the detection of absorption associated with dlas and  absorbers towards sdss qsos ( e.g. kanekar et al .",
    "2009b ; gupta et al .",
    "2009 ; srianand et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 ) .",
    "a more targeted approach is to design an optical search for dlas towards radio - loud qsos ( ellison et al .",
    "2001 ; jorgenson et al .",
    "2006 ; ellison et al .",
    "2008 ) . to fully exploit these new surveys ,",
    "there has also been progress on the technical side , with improvements in the frequency range accessible by large radio telescopes such as the westerbork synthesis radio telescope ( wsrt ) , the green bank telescope ( gbt ) and the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . as a result of these advances",
    ", the opportunity now exists to gather significant numbers of  measurements in dlas at high redshifts , @xmath14 .",
    "almost immediately , the measurements of  in high redshift dlas yielded a surprise result : whereas @xmath15 dlas exhibit a range of spin temperatures , the sample of absorbers at @xmath16 appeared to be dominated by spin temperatures in excess of 1000 k ( carilli et al . 1996 ; chengalur & kanekar 2000 ; kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; kanekar et al .",
    "2007 ; kanekar et al . 2012 ) .",
    "although york et al .",
    "( 2007 ) discovered the first low  dla at @xmath17 , whether or not there is a wholesale evolution in  with redshift has remained a hotly debated topic ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; wolfe , gawiser & prochaska 2003 ; curran et al .",
    "2005 ; kanekar et al .",
    "in addition to being limited by statistics , there has been considerable focus on the possible effect of the so - called covering factor , @xmath4 ( e.g. wolfe , gawiser & prochaska 2003 ; curran et al . 2005 ; kanekar et al .",
    "if the background radio source is extended , then the foreground absorber will not fully cover it ; this would imply a low covering factor , @xmath18 . since most  absorption studies actually determine the ratio /@xmath4 ( and not  alone ) , assuming @xmath19 would result in an over - estimate of the spin temperature .",
    "it has also been claimed ( curran & webb 2006 ) that due to cosmological geometry , different covering factors are to be expected in different redshift regimes .",
    "in particular , absorbers at high redshifts , @xmath20 , are always at larger angular diameter distances than the background qsos , potentially leading to systematically lower covering factors for higher redshift dlas . however , in a very long baseline array ( vlba ) study of radio - loud qsos with foreground dlas , kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009a ) found none of the 24 dlas of their sample have @xmath21 , and that there was no difference in the distributions of the covering factors of the high-@xmath10 and low-@xmath10 dla samples .",
    "kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009a ) hence concluded that low covering factors in high-@xmath10 dlas were not the cause of the apparent redshift evolution in the spin temperature .",
    "a second intriguing suggestion involving spin temperatures is the possible anti - correlation between  and metallicity ( kanekar et al .",
    "since metals are the primary coolant in the ism , one would expect the fraction of cold gas to increase as the metallicity increases ( kanekar & chengalur 2001 ) .",
    "kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009c ) reported a tentative detection of this anti - correlation at @xmath22 significance from a sample of 26 dlas , of which 10 had measurements of ( rather than limits on ) both  and metallicity .",
    "again , the absorber covering factors were available for only a subset of the dlas .    the main challenge in confirming the redshift evolution of  and the anti - correlation of  and metallicity is simple statistics .",
    "for example , there remains a glaring gap in the redshift coverage of  measurements between @xmath23 , the so - called  redshift desert .",
    "there are only two published  detections in dlas in this regime , which spans 4 gigayears in cosmic time ( brown & roberts 1973 ; kanekar et al .",
    "to fill this regime , several surveys have searched for  absorption in strong  systems that have been identified from ground - based optical surveys ( e.g. ellison et al .",
    "2004 ; prochter , prochaska & burles 2006 ) .",
    "although these  surveys have now yielded a significant number of  absorption detections in the redshift desert ( gupta et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ; srianand et al .",
    "2008 ; kanekar et al .",
    "2009b ) , the critical  measurements required to determine the spin temperatures have been missing .",
    "a second obstacle has been determining covering factors for the full redshift range of absorbers , since these corrections are required to confidently test any trends in .    in this paper",
    ", we present a comprehensive set of multi - wavelength data for six  absorbers in the redshift desert .",
    "this is an effective way to improve spin temperature statistics since the main limitation of identifying systems with  detections has already been addressed .",
    "the data span six decades in rest wavelength ranging from near ultra - violet ( uv ) absorption at 1216   through the optical and out to the redshifted 21  cm line frequency in the radio regime .",
    "the sample is selected primarily based on  absorption in a sample of strong  absorbers ( gupta et al .",
    "2009 ; kanekar et al .",
    "the near - uv data cover the  transition , from which the column density of the absorber can be measured .",
    "we also present vlba images of all of the qsos in order to determine their low - frequency covering factors .",
    "finally , we complement the dataset with optical echelle spectra that permit the measurement of the column densities of a variety of elements .",
    "combined with the  measurements from the  data , we can hence also determine metal abundances .",
    "the dataset presented here is therefore unique at this redshift and represents the first systematic study of metallicities and spin temperatures in the redshift desert . in this paper",

    "below , we briefly summarise the noteworthy features of each absorber .      the  absorbers presented in this paper are part of two samples of `` strong ''  absorbers , selected from the sdss and the corals survey ( ellison et al .",
    "2001 ) , towards radio - loud quasars that were surveyed for  absorption with the gmrt and the gbt ( kanekar et al . 2009b",
    "; gupta et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the selection criteria were ( 1 )  @xmath31   and @xmath32    ( where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the rest equivalent widths in the @xmath302796 and @xmath302600 transitions , respectively ) and ( 2 )  that the absorber should lie towards a radio - loud background quasar with flux density @xmath35  mjy at the redshifted  line frequency .      the relative velocity between the dla and the background qso is @xmath37 200 .",
    "although this velocity offset is likely to be uncertain by several hundreds of  ( van den berk 2001 ; richards et al .",
    "2002 ; shen et al .",
    "2007 ) , the absorber is almost certainly a `` proximate '' dla ( pdla ; e.g. the surveys by ellison et al .",
    "2002 ; russell , ellison & benn 2006 ; prochaska , hennawi & herbert - fort 2008 ) .",
    "there is evidence that high  pdlas may have elevated abundances , by a factor @xmath38 ( ellison et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "further , the spin temperatures in pdlas are likely to be affected by the proximity of the gas to a bright radio source ( e.g. field 1958 ) .",
    "we discuss the treatment of pdlas in our sample explicitly in section [ pdla_sec ] .",
    "the  absorption towards this absorber has a narrow profile that is well fit with a simple 2-gaussian model ( gupta et al . 2007 ; kanekar et al .",
    "as noted in section [ vlba_sec ] , there is evidence of a core - jet structure in the 606  mhz vlba image , which leads to a core covering factor of 0.32 .",
    "the core is unresolved along the declination axis , with angular extent @xmath39  mas ( i.e. spatial extent @xmath40  pc ) .",
    "the  column density in this absorber has a larger uncertainty than that of the other dlas in our sample as the absorption overlaps with the  emission line ; this is a common problem for pdlas .",
    "nonetheless , the  is clearly extremely high in this absorber , the largest in our sample with log  = @xmath41 .",
    "both hires and uves data are available for this sightline ; the latter were obtained from the uves archive , from proposal 082.a-0569 ( pi srianand ) .",
    "the uves data have a higher s / n and wider wavelength coverage and are used in preference to the hires data for most transitions . however , the hires data have more extensive coverage of the blue spectrum for transitions with rest wavelengths 1290  @xmath421475  .",
    "the combination of good s / n and high  facilitates the detection of a wide range of metal line transitions , which all show a blended two - component structure .",
    "the  absorption is offset from the strongest metal line component , and lies between the two components in velocity space ( figure [ 21cm_echelle ] ) .",
    "the column density of  is reported as a lower limit due to the mild saturation of the @xmath301808 transition .",
    "overall , this absorber has a metallicity of @xmath43 , which is relatively metal - poor for this redshift ( see section [ results_sec ] ) .",
    "the low metallicity also puts this absorber at odds with the majority of other high pdlas , which tend to have relatively high abundances ( ellison et al .",
    "2010 , 2011 ) .",
    "the uves spectrum of b0237@xmath36233 , obtained as part of a uves large program , ( 166.a-0106 , pi bergeron ) , is truly exquisite .",
    "the combination of very long integration times ( approximately 25 hours split between two different wavelength settings ) and a bright apparent magnitude ( @xmath44 ) leads to s / n ratios up to 150 .",
    "the high quality of the uves spectrum , which extends as blue as 3050  , therefore permits a precise measure of  in this low @xmath10 absorber without the need for hst .",
    "we note the presence of a saturated  line in the red wing of the dla .",
    "lack of coverage of unsaturated higher order lyman lines precludes an accurate  measurement of this line .",
    "however , this contamination is unlikely to affect the dla fit , which is driven by the extended damping wings .    despite the low  of this absorber , which is below the traditional threshold of dlas , the metal lines are sufficiently strong to enable us to determine a wide suite of abundances .",
    "the only species listed in table [ abund_tab ] that we do not significantly detect is the challenging .",
    "there is actually a very weak absorption feature at the expected wavelength of  @xmath30 1910.6 , but its significance is only 2@xmath45 . we therefore conservatively report the formal 3@xmath45 limit for this transition .    the  absorption is well aligned with the strongest of the two metal line components ( figure [ 21cm_echelle ] ) .",
    "there is a single pixel feature in the  absorption spectrum which is aligned with the weaker metal feature .",
    "although suggestive , this feature is not statistically significant in the current gbt spectrum and is not included in the integrated  optical depth .",
    "the vlba map of this quasar reveals a compact radio core , from which we derive a very high covering factor of 0.90 .",
    "the spatial extent of the core emission is @xmath46  pc@xmath47 , at the absorber redshift .",
    "kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009b ) discuss the likely low covering fraction of this absorber ( see also kunert et al .",
    "our vlba imaging shows a weak , compact continuum source with a flux density that is only about 2% of the total flux density measured with a lower resolution interferometer .",
    "this clearly suggests that the radio emission from this source is extended on scales larger than 0.22 arcsec ; a value set by the vlba short spacing limit at 606 mhz .",
    "it is therefore likely that the  absorption arises against the extended radio flux and not against the radio core .",
    "the likely non - coincidence of the optical and radio sightlines implies that we can not determine the spin temperature of this absorber .",
    "we therefore do not include this sub - dla in our spin temperature analysis ( it is excluded from table [ summary_tab ] ) and have not sought to obtain high resolution optical spectroscopy .",
    "this paper presents a new detection of  absorption in the sightline towards j1431 + 3952 .",

    "the two  absorption components are well aligned with the velocity structure seen in  ( figure [ 21cm_echelle ] ) .",
    "the relatively low s / n around the  @xmath30 2260 line makes its velocity structure harder to discern .",

    "the core is extremely compact , with a deconvolved angular size of 0  mas along the declination axis , indicating that the angular extent along this axis is @xmath49  mas ( i.e. a spatial extent of @xmath50  pc ) .",

    "four of the dlas shown in figure [ ts_z ] are proximate dlas within 3000  of the qso ( b0105@xmath36008 , q0405@xmath36331 , q1013 + 615 and q0528@xmath36250 ) , including one of the absorbers in our intermediate redshift sample ( b0105@xmath36008 ) .",
    "there are various reasons why pdlas might be excluded from a general analysis of abundances in aborbers .",
    "first , radiation from the qso may alter the hyperfine level populations in the  atoms ( e.g. field 1958 ; wolfe & burbidge 1975 ) .",
    "the result of such irradiation would be that the observed spin temperature would depend both on the radiation field and on the distribution of gas in different temperature phases , significantly complicating the interpretation .",
    "three of the four pdlas in our sample have @xmath69k ; they are all at @xmath70 where such spin temperatures are typical ( figure [ ts_z ] ) .",
    "the final pdla is the absorber towards q0105@xmath36008 from our redshift desert sample ( @xmath71 ) , with  = 305k ( including the correction for a covering factor of 0.32 ) .",
    "independent of the  absorption , it has been suggested that pdlas with log  @xmath72 are biased towards higher metallicities ( ellison et al .",

    "another class of absorbers that is often distinguished from the general dla population consists of the so - called sub - dlas , systems with @xmath74  log  @xmath75 .",
    "although their  falls below the classical dla criterion , they show clear damping wings and in many cases have reliable abundances ( e.g. dessauges - zavadsky et al .",

    "indeed , there is evidence from galactic sightlines that below the dla  threshold there is only a small contribution from the cnm ( kaneker et al .",
    "finally , it is observed that low - redshift sub - dlas ( which have been mostly identified through their large  equivalent widths ) have systematically higher metallicities than dlas at the same redshift ( e.g. peroux et al .",
    "2008 ; meiring et al . 2009",
    "; dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "2009 ) .    despite these literature debates",
    ", we do include sub - dlas in the current work , as it is of interest to see whether the galactic trends with  are also evident in cosmological dlas and sub - dlas .",
    "in particular , if the cnm fractions ( and hence , spin temperatures ) depend on metallicity , we might expect trends between these parameters to extend into the sub - dla regime , regardless of the nature of the intervening galaxy .",
    "however , we do distinguish sub - dlas from dlas in figures and quoted statistics .      in figure [ abund_z ]",
    "we show the abundances of three commonly measured elements ( zn , fe and si ) in dlas and sub - dlas with absorption studies , as a function of redshift .",
    "we distinguish low and high ( including lower limits ) spin temperatures by plotting filled stars for absorbers with  @xmath9 500 k and open stars for absorbers with higher values of .",
    "for comparison , we show a literature compilation ( berg et al , in preparation ; rafelski et al .",

    "the now well - documented ( e.g. peroux et al .",
    "2008 ; meiring et al .",
    "2009 ) enhancement in sub - dla abundances is clearly present at low redshifts ( @xmath76 ) . whilst it has been suggested that their high metallicities indicate that sub - dlas sample the most massive galaxies , dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have argued that this may be a selection effect , since the majority of sub - dlas in this redshift range were selected via the -based survey of rao et al .",
    "( 2006 ) .",
    "whilst  selection seems to sample dlas in an unbiased way , dessauges - zavadsky et al .",
    "( 2009 ) have argued that at lower  there may be a bias towards larger velocity widths and/or metallicities ( see also rao et al .",
    "2006 for a discussion on selection bias , and bouche 2008 for further evidence of a bias towards high metallicity sub - dlas selected by ) . in either case , the sample selected using  absorption ( many of which , at @xmath76 , were also originally selected based on  rest equivalent width ) show evidence of the same metallicity trends as the absorbers towards the full quasar sample .",
    "the  absorber metallicities cover the same ranges as those of the full sample , and the  sub - dlas show evidence for slightly higher metallicities than dlas at the same redshift .",
    "although the elevated metallicities in  sub - dlas are consistent with optical samples , known trends in  absorbers may make the high metallicities in sub - dlas with  absorption seem puzzling .",
    "kanekar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have shown that galactic sightlines with in the sub - dla regime tend to have high spin temperatures , and kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009c ) find that high spin temperatures are more usually found in low metallicity systems .",
    "so , we might expect that  absorbers in the sub - dla regime should have relatively low ( rather than the observed high ) abundances .",
    "in figure [ hi_ts ] we put these arguments on a quantitative footing by showing the spin temperature and  galactic data points used by kanekar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , as well as the values for  detections in dlas .",
    "the latter have been colour - coded by metallicity .",
    "metallicities are taken to be , in order of preference , [ zn / h ] , [ s / h ] , [ si / h ] , [ fe / h]+0.4 ( where the offset accounts for typical dust depletions ; prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) . since the correction to [ fe / h ] is rather crude we give priority to , for example , a [ zn / h ] limit over a [ fe / h ] detection .",
    "the exception to these priorities is ao0235 + 164 for which we use an x - ray metallicity , as there is evidence that this is a very dusty absorber with depletion considerably larger than the typical value of 0.4 that we otherwise adopt ( e.g. junkarrinen et al 2004 ; kulkarni et al .",
    "the lower left part of the diagram with @xmath77  and @xmath78 k is poorly populated by the galactic and sub - dla sightlines alike .",
    "this supports the suggestion by kanekar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) that below this column density threshold , the neutral medium is dominated by warm gas . at higher column densities ,",
    "the dlas show much more scatter in  than the galactic data , but with a clear dependence on metallicity .",
    "the dlas with metallicities below around 1/10 of the solar value ( yellow , green and blue points ) have high spin temperatures for their , relative to the milky way points .",
    "the more metal - rich dlas ( orange and red points ) have either comparable , or low spin temperatures for their .",
    "such a metallicity dependence may be expected from cooling arguments , whereby metals aid the cooling of the neutral medium ( wolfire et al .",
    "1995 ; kanekar & chengalur 2001 ) , in a similar way that metals have been suggested to aid the transformation from the neutral to molecular regimes ( schaye 2001 ; krumholz et al .",
    "2009 ) .    in figure [ hi_fcnm ]",
    ", we make a crude conversion of the spin temperature into a cnm fraction ( see also kanekar & chengalur 2003 ) . for this calculation ,",
    "in which we adopt a two phase medium , we must assign spin temperatures to the cold and warm neutral media ( wnm ) . for the cnm ,",
    "the spin temperature is the same as the kinetic temperature ( e.g. liszt 2001 ) , and we adopt a value of 90k .",
    "however , in the wnm , the low densities are insufficient to thermalise the  transition ( e.g. liszt 2001 ) .",
    "therefore , although the kinetic temperature of the wnm is expected to be 50008000k , the spin temperature , which will depend on the physical conditions within the cloud , is expected to be considerably lower , 1000 - 4000k ( liszt 2001 ) .",
    "although the cnm fractions that are calculated will depend on the temperatures used , the qualitative distribution of points remains the same .",
    "we adopt a  for the wnm of 3000k , although we note that this will lead to an ( unphysical ) negative cnm fraction if the measured @xmath79 3000 k. figure [ hi_fcnm ] shows that , as suggested by kanekar et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the low  galactic sightlines are dominated by the wnm .",
    "as the increases , a higher cnm fraction is present .",
    "the sub - dla in our sample also has a relatively low cnm fraction , consistent with the upper end of the distribution seen in galactic ( sub - dla ) sightlines . in the dla regime ,",
    "the low metallicity absorbers have relatively low cnm fractions , compared with the milky way .",
    "the dlas with high cnm fractions tend to be relatively metal - rich .      in the previous sub - section we showed that sub - dlas tend to have high  ( and therefore high fractions of warm gas ) , regardless of their often elevated metallicities .",
    "dlas _ may _ exhibit significant fractions of cold gas , but this is likely to be metallicity dependent .",
    "we now turn to the explicit dependence of spin temperature on metallicity .",
    "kanekar & chengalur ( 2001 ) predicted that an anti - correlation between  and metallicity would naturally arise if the paucity of cold neutral gas in dlas was due to fewer cooling routes due to a lack of metals in the absorbers . the largest sample to have been previously used to address this issue was a sample of 26 absorbers , of which 10 systems had both  and metallicity measurements and 20 systems had estimates of the low - frequency covering factors ( kanekar et al .",
    "the number of detections in our sample is significantly increased to 17 , even with the additional requirement that all absorbers must have low frequency covering factor measurements to be included in our sample .",
    "the new data presented here include dlas with very high and low spin temperatures , which are particularly useful for anchoring any relationship with metallicity ( figure [ ts_met ] ) .",
    "we note that the lowest metallicity absorber in the lower panel of figure [ ts_met ] ( which has the highest spin temperature amongst the systems with both  and metal line detections ) is q0952 + 179 . due to our prioritization of metallicities , this dla appears in the upper panel as an upper limit from [ zn / h ] , but its measured value of [ fe / h ] is used in the lower panel .    for the full sample of 26 detections and limits , a non - parametric generalised kendall - tau rank correlation test ( the bhk statistic in the asurv package ; brown et al . 1974 ; isobe et al . 1986 ) detects an anti - correlation between metallicity and spin temperature at @xmath80 significance ( figure [ ts_met ] , upper panel ) , treating the metallicity as the independent variable .",
    "if the dla towards ao0235 + 164 is dropped from the sample ( in contrast with the rest of the sample , its metallicity has been obtained from a x - ray measurement ) , the significance of the anti - correlation is @xmath81 . reducing the sample to only the 17 systems with measurements of both  and metallicity ( i.e. excluding limits ; see figure  [ ts_met ] , lower panel ) yields an anti - correlation with @xmath82 significance .",
    "again , dropping ao0235 + 164 from this detection sample gives an anti - correlation with a @xmath83 significance ( 16 systems ) .",
    "there is only one sub - dla included in figure [ ts_met ] , the @xmath84 absorber towards q0237@xmath36233 , whose spin temperature we present for the first time in this work . despite the low ,",
    "the spin temperature is relatively low in this absorber : @xmath85k .",
    "the moderately high metallicity ( @xmath86 ) places this sub - dla in good agreement with the dla data on figure  [ ts_met ] .",
    "dropping the one sub - dla from the sample yields a -metallicity anti - correlation that is significant at @xmath87 and @xmath88 for limits+detections and detections only , respectively .",
    "we also used a linear regression analysis to obtain the best - fit relation between spin temperature ( log [ ] ) and metallicity [ z / h ] , applying this to the 17 dlas with measurements of ( rather than limits on ) _ both _  and [ z / h ] ( see figure  [ ts_met ] , lower panel ) .",
    "we used the bces(y@xmath89x ) estimator ( akritas & bershady 1996 ) for this purpose , again treating [ z / h ] as the independent variable x. note that this method takes into account measurement errors on both variables , as well as correlations between these errors .",
    "this is relevant here as both  and [ z / h ] are derived from the  column density , and the errors on the two quantities are hence correlated .",
    "the regression analysis yielded log [ ]  @xmath90 } + ( 1.93 \\pm 0.19)$ ] , consistent with the results of kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009c ) .",
    "the fit is shown as a solid line in the lower panel of figure  [ ts_met ] . if , instead of the ( y@xmath89x ) technique , we adopt the bces bisector method for independent variables , the fit is consistent to within 1@xmath45 : log [ ]  @xmath91 } + ( 1.70 \\pm 0.19)$ ] .",
    "kanekar et al .",
    "( 2009c ) did not find a significant anti - correlation between dust depletion and . in figure [ dust_ts ]",
    "we confirm this by plotting  versus dust depletion [ x / fe ] ( where x = zn , s , si , or the x - ray value for ao0235 + 164 ) for our expanded sample . applying the generalised kendall tau test to our sample of 22 systems with either measurements of or limits on  and dust depletion ( figure [ dust_ts ] , upper panel ) we find a @xmath92 anti - correlation between  and [ x / fe ] , considerably weaker than the anti - correlation between  and metallicity . ] .",
    "note that only a handful of dlas ( 11 systems ) have measurements of both dust depletion and ; this sub - sample shows no evidence of an anti - correlation between [ x / fe ] and , with a significance of @xmath93 .",
    "the lack of a significant dependence of  on depletion demonstrates that the -metallicity anti - correlation is not driven by an underlying dependence on dust .",
    "we also note that the dlas with  absorption show a range of depletions that is well - matched to the range in the full dla sample , where the mean value of [ zn / fe]@xmath48 + 0.4 ( e.g. prochaska & wolfe 2002 ) .",
    "the absorbers in the sample selected here were identified first as  systems , then as  absorbers , with the  determination as the final step . excluding b0801 + 303 , which was _ post facto _",
    "found to be an extended radio source , 4/5 of the -selected absorbers in our sample are found to be dlas .",
    "this compares with a 35% dla identification rate for absorbers selected purely on equivalent width ( rao et al .",
    "2006 ) and @xmath48 60% when velocity widths are also taken into account ( ellison 2006 ; ellison , murphy & dessauges - zavadsky 2009 ) .",
    "the one sub - dla in our main sample is towards b0237@xmath36233 , whose  optical depth is the lowest in our sample by a factor of @xmath48 3 .",
    "the connection between  absorbers and dlas is not particularly surprising .",
    "several works ( e.g. kanekar & chengalur 2003 ; curran et al .",
    "2010 ) have noted a correlation between the integrated optical depth and .",
    "further , kanekar et al . (",
    "2011 ) show that most galactic sightlines with @xmath94  have relatively high spin temperatures , and are hence dominated by the wnm . only above this approximate threshold",
    "can the neutral gas apparently cool sufficiently to form a significant fraction of the cool phase , then becoming readily detectable in  absorption .",
    "absorbers may therefore represent an interesting alternative identification of dlas at low redshifts .",
    "the obvious concern is how representative such a selection would be . given the results discussed in this paper , it may be expected that  absorption is most readily detected at large  and high metallicity .",
    "indeed , all four dlas of the present sample have high , in excess of 10@xmath95 .",
    "this is unsurprising , since for a given  the  optical depth will be highest for the highest  absorbers . since dlas with log  @xmath72 are relatively rare ,  selection offers a good opportunity to identify the highest column density absorbers for targeted studies . for example , many of the ` metal - strong ' dlas ( herbert - fort et al . 2006 ; kaplan et al .",
    "2010 ) , which are useful for the identification of rare metal species , have such high .    despite the bias towards high  in an  selected sample of dlas , the metallicities and dust depletion in  absorbers span the observed range in the full sample of dlas and sub - dlas ( figures [ abund_z ] and [ dust_ts ] ) . in figure [ hi_zn ] ,",
    "we also show the metallicities ( as measured by [ zn / h ] ) as a function of .",
    "it has been argued that the anti - correlation between [ zn / h ] and  is inconsistent with a dust bias , given the typical reddening in dla samples ( elllison , hall & lira 2005 ) .",
    "the paucity of high  absorbers with high metallicities can instead be understood as a metallicity - dependent transition from the atomic phase to a phase dominated by molecular gas ( schaye 2001 ; krumholz et al .",
    "the  absorbers have metallicities consistent with those of the full sample of dlas at a given .",
    "combined with figures [ abund_z ] and [ dust_ts ] , this indicates that an  selected sample is not strongly biased for studies of elemental abundances .",
    "the study of  absorbers at cosmological distances is now coming of age in terms of sample sizes , redshift coverage and availability of covering factors .",
    "this paper focuses on our efforts to fill in the spin temperature redshift desert ( @xmath96 ) and investigate the role of metallicity in modulating spin temperature trends . in a companion paper ( kanekar et al . in prep . )",
    "much of the supporting high redshift data used in our analysis is presented , as well as a analysis of the redshift evolution of the spin temperature .",

    "the metallicities and dust depletions of  absorbers span the range that is typical for the full dla sample in the same redshift range ( or at fixed ) . as is the case for the full dla ,",

    "<S> the  absorption optical depth and the  column density derived from  absorption can be combined to yield the spin temperature ( ) of intervening damped ly@xmath0 absorbers ( dlas ) . </S>",
    "<S> although spin temperature measurements exist for samples of dlas with @xmath1 and @xmath2 , the intermediate redshift regime currently contains only two  detections , leading to a `` redshift desert '' that spans 4 gigayears of cosmic time . to connect the low and high redshift regimes , we present observations of the  line of six @xmath3  absorbers . </S>",
    "<S> the dataset is complemented by both low - frequency very long baseline array ( vlba ) observations ( to derive the absorber covering factor , @xmath4 ) , and optical echelle spectra from which metal abundances are determined . </S>",
    "<S> our dataset therefore not only offers the largest statistical study of  absorbers to date , and bridges the redshift desert , but is also the first to use a fully @xmath4-corrected dataset to look for metallicity - based trends .    </S>",
    "<S> the metallicities of  absorbers are consistent with those of optically - selected dlas at the same redshift . in agreement with trends found in galactic sightlines , </S>",
    "<S> we find that the lowest column density absorbers tend to be dominated by warm gas . in the dla regime , </S>",
    "<S> spin temperatures show a wider range of values than galactic data , as may be expected in a heterogenous galactic population . </S>",
    "<S> however , we find that low metallicity dlas are dominated by small cold gas fractions and only absorbers with relatively high metallicities exhibit significant fractions of cold gas . using a compilation of  absorbers which are selected to have covering - factor corrected spin temperatures </S>",
    "<S> , we confirm an anti - correlation between metallicity and  at @xmath5 significance . </S>",
    "<S> finally , one of the dlas in our sample is a newly - discovered  absorber ( at @xmath6 towards j1431 + 3952 ) , which we find to have the lowest @xmath4-corrected spin temperature yet reported in the literature :  @xmath7  k. the observed distribution of  and metallicities in dlas and the implications for understanding the characteristics of the interstellar medium in high redshift galaxies are discussed .    </S>",
