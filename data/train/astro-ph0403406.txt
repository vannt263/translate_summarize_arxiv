    "evidence that the jets in low - luminosity , fri @xcite radio galaxies are initially relativistic and decelerate on kpc scales has mounted in recent years .",

    "superluminal motions have been seen on milliarcsecond scales in several fri jets @xcite and on arcsecond scales in m87 @xcite . in fri sources ,",
    "the lobe containing the main ( brighter ) jet is less depolarized than the counter - jet lobe @xcite .",
    "this can be explained if the main jet points toward the observer , suggesting that the brightness asymmetry is caused by doppler beaming @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry decreases with distance from the nucleus @xcite , implying that the jets must decelerate .",

    "* hereafter lb ) fit vla images of the radio jets in the nearby fri radio galaxy 3c31 using a sophisticated model to reproduce the observed total and polarized emission within 30arcsec of the nucleus , where the jets are straight .",
    "they parameterized the three - dimensional distributions of velocity , emissivity and magnetic - field structure , calculated the brightness at each point within the jets in stokes @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , accounting for the effects of relativistic aberration , and integrated along the line of sight to reproduce the expected distributions on the sky .",
    "they concluded that the jets in 3c31 could be accurately modelled as intrinsically identical , axisymmetric , antiparallel , decelerating , relativistic flows , with locally random but anisotropic magnetic fields .",
    "optimization of the model parameters placed tight constraints on the geometry , velocity , emissivity and field structure .",
    "@xcite used this velocity field , together with estimates of the external pressure and density from _ chandra _ observations @xcite in a conservation - law analysis based on that of @xcite .",
    "they showed that there are self - consistent solutions for jet deceleration by injection of thermal matter and derived the variations of pressure , density , mach number and entrainment rate along the jets .",
    "finally , @xcite developed models of adiabatic , relativistic jets with velocity shear and applied them to 3c31 .",
    "they demonstrated that such models provide a reasonable description of the emissivity and magnetic - field variations at large distances from the nucleus but fail closer in , and inferred that significant reacceleration of relativistic particles is required precisely where x - ray synchrotron emission is observed @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we apply a modified version of lb s model to the jets of two fri radio galaxies : b20326 + 39 and b21553 + 24 .",
    "our principal aim is identical to that of lb : to estimate the distributions of velocity , emissivity and magnetic - field structure without introducing preconceptions about the ( poorly understood ) internal physics . by studying different objects we hope to be able to improve the range of physical scales we are able to probe , to identify which intrinsic features are common to all fri jets and which vary from object to object and to assess the dependence of the jet structure on power and environmental conditions .",

    "we use the notation @xmath12 for the degree of linear polarization .",
    "our models assume that the jets are intrinsically identical , antiparallel , axisymmetric stationary flows , so any apparent differences must be due entirely to relativistic effects .",
    "some important selection criteria are therefore imposed on our choice of source :    1 .",
    "only straight parts of the jets can be modelled and it is therefore important that the first bends in both the main and counter - jets be as far from the nucleus as possible .",
    "2 .   the jet and counter - jet must leave the nucleus in strictly antiparallel directions .",
    "3 .   we derive the _ sidedness ratio _ by dividing a total - intensity image of the jets by a copy of itself rotated through 180@xmath13 about the nucleus .",
    "the ratio is in the sense main jet / counter - jet and can not be @xmath31 over a significant area if the asymmetries are to be attributed entirely to relativistic effects ( we expect some local fluctuations due to small - scale structure ) .",
    "this excludes a few objects , in particular those where the counter - jet is wider than the main jet ( e.g.  b20755 + 379 ; @xcite ) .",
    "there can not be any other radio features ( e.g.  lobes ) that could be confused with the emission from the jet .",

    "we conclude that there is no compelling evidence in favour of reacceleration of the jets in either source , and that it is most unlikely to be the sole cause of the increase in sidedness ratio with distance from the nucleus in b20326 + 39 .",
    "nevertheless , it is expected theoretically , there are hints that it might occur , and it is consistent with the total intensity and polarization data in b21553 + 24 .",
    "we infer that the angle to the line of sight for b21553 + 24 is @xmath318@xmath13 .",
    "given that the b2 sample from which it is drawn is selected at the low frequency of 408mhz , the usual assumption is that the emission is isotropic and therefore that the distribution of jet orientations for its members should be random .",
    "the source should therefore have many ( @xmath65100 ) counterparts of comparable total luminosity and larger @xmath38 , but the entire sample of b2 radio galaxies with jets defined in tables1 and 2 of @xcite has 43 members .",
    "a further concern is that the counterparts must be very large .",
    "the length of the main jet is at least 60arcsec ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1553.montage]a ) , corresponding to 388arcsec ( 340kpc ) at @xmath66 , the median angle to the line of sight .",
    "this is comparable in size with the longest jet in the sample , in ngc315 @xcite , and far larger than the median ( @xmath3130kpc ; @xcite ) .",
    "there is cause for suspicion unless : ( a ) the side - on counterparts of b21553 + 24 are not members of the b2 sample or ( b ) sources in that sample have linear sizes far larger than previously realised .    in order to understand potential selection effects ,",
    "we have computed the appearance of the model brightness distribution for b21553 + 24 at various angles to the line of sight .",
    "we show the results for the median angle to the line of sight for an isotropic sample ( @xmath67 ) and for a source in the plane of the sky ( @xmath68 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:1553los ] .",
    "the area chosen for the plots corresponds to the modelled region for the @xmath69 case .",
    "as well as being very long , the jets appear narrow , straight and ( except for a small region around the nucleus ) extremely faint . the total flux density from the inner 200kpc of the model jets ( measured along the jets and excluding the core )",
    "is constrained to be 44mjy for the @xmath70 model but is 27mjy for @xmath66 .",
    "there are three important selection effects :    1 .",
    "the extended flux of the jets shows significant doppler boosting at small @xmath38 .",
    "given that there is little lobe emission in b21553 + 24 @xcite , the jets probably dominate the flux at low radio frequencies , so end - on sources of this type will be selected preferentially in the b2 survey .",
    "the integral source count @xmath71 for the luminosities and redshifts in question , so the size of the parent sample is effectively increased by a factor of @xmath72 if isotropic lobe emission is ignored .",
    "2 .   except for a small region around the nucleus , the model jets are faint .",
    "further than 50arcsec from the nucleus , the surface brightness is @xmath490.16mjy / beam area at 8.4ghz with a beam of 2.75arcsec fwhm .",
    "this scales to 0.47mjy / beam area at 1.4ghz for a spectral index @xmath73 , comparable with the detection threshold for typical vla images of sources in the sample presented by @xcite . in any case ,",
    "emission on scales @xmath4120arcsec would not have been imaged reliably in existing vla observations of the b2 sample ( c configuration at 1.4ghz ; @xcite ) .",
    "the combination of these two effects makes it extremely unlikely that the outer jets would have been detected .",
    "sources of large angular size with flux densities close to the limit of the catalogue could have been missed by the original b2 survey , which measured peak rather than integrated flux density .",
    "we have estimated the magnitude of this effect by convolving the model brightness distribution for @xmath66 with the beam of the b2 survey ( 3 @xmath74 10arcmin@xmath75 ) .",
    "if the short axis of the beam is parallel to the jet axis , the ratio of peak / total flux is 0.73 ; if the long axis of the beam is aligned , the ratio becomes 0.95 .",
    "a few sources could therefore have been missed ( primarily those orientated e - w ) .",
    "we conclude that the side - on counterparts of b21553 + 24 could have escaped identification , either because they were missed in the original survey or because their angular sizes have been greatly underestimated .",
    "morganti & parma ( private communication ) and ledlow & owen ( 2004 ; in preparation ) have made more sensitive observations of radio galaxies in the b2 sample using the wsrt and the vla in d configuration and have shown that a significant fraction of them have much longer radio jets than have previously been reported , extending many 100 s of kpc or even further .",
    "we suggest that these form part of the missing population .",
    "in later papers , we will present a re - analysis of 3c31 along with models of two further objects , all with the same functional descriptions of velocity , emissivity and magnetic field .",
    "this will allow a full comparison between them ; here we make a few general observations about the similarities and differences between b20326 + 39 , b21553 + 24 and 3c31 .",
    "notable similarities are :    1 .",
    "all three objects can be modelled successfully by a decelerating jet model .",
    "2 .   the jets are all initially well collimated , then flare before recollimating and expanding conically .",
    "3 .   close to the nucleus",
    "the jet velocity on - axis is consistent with a value of @xmath76 in all cases .",
    "deceleration occurs over a region of @xmath3110kpc to an outer velocity of @xmath77 .",
    "the ratio of edge to on - axis velocity is consistent with a constant value of @xmath310.7 everywhere , although in some places this is poorly constrained .",
    "the exponent of the emissivity index is similar in the outermost modelled regions of all the jets .",
    "7 .   at the jet edge",
    "the emissivity falls to @xmath310.25 of its on - axis value .",
    "the longitudinal field component dominates in the high - velocity regions close to the nucleus and the toroidal component in the outer parts , qualitatively but not quantitatively as expected from flux freezing .",
    "the variation of the radial field component is more complex than predicted by simple flux - freezing models .",
    "this effect can not simply be due to velocity shear in a laminar , axisymmetric flow .",
    "close to the nucleus ( in the high - velocity and deceleration regions ) , the variation of emissivity with distance from the nucleus is far less rapid than predicted by the adiabatic approximation .",
    "11 . in the low - velocity outer regions ,",
    "the emissivity variation is reasonably well fitted by a quasi - one - dimensional adiabatic model .",
    "the three objects were expected to have a wide range of angles to the line of sight ; this is confirmed by our modelling .",
    "in addition , there are some clear differences :    1 .",
    "the conical outer region of 3c31 has a large opening angle and is centred on the nucleus .",
    "the outer regions of the other two objects are closer to cylindrical , with very small opening angles and vertices far behind the nucleus . [",
    "note that 3c31 does recollimate outside the modelled region ( lb ) ] .",
    "the velocity in the outer region of 3c31 was modelled by lb as decreasing monotonically with distance from the nucleus ( as required by the variation of sidedness ratio ) . in the b2 sources",
    ", it has an approximately constant asymptotic value .",
    "the close connection between the jet geometry and the forms of the velocity and emissivity profiles inferred for 3c31 is not general .",
    "the velocity in b21553 + 24 remains at @xmath76 until @xmath3120kpc from the nucleus ( cf .",
    "@xmath312kpc in the other two objects ) .",
    "there is no need for a discontinuity in emissivity in b21553 + 24 : the brightening of the jet is consistent with expansion at constant emissivity .",
    "although the biggest single field component at large distances is always toroidal , there are significant differences in the details of the field - component evolution : 3c31 has a mixture of longitudinal and toroidal components ; b20326 + 39 has toroidal and radial components and b21553 + 24 has almost pure toroidal field .",
    "7 .   in 3c31 ,",
    "the radial field component in the flaring region increases towards the edge of the jet .",
    "there is no evidence for this effect in the b2 sources , although it can not be excluded in b20326 + 39 , where the signal - to - noise ratio is low .",
    "the adiabatic approximation describes the emissivity evolution in b2,1553 + 24 over a much larger fraction of the jets than in the other two sources",
    ". this may be because it applies most accurately in the low - velocity outer region , which is relatively longer in this source .",
    "we have shown that the total and linearly - polarized synchrotron emission from the jets of the fri radio galaxies b20326 + 39 and b21553 + 24 can be modelled successfully on the assumption that they are axisymmetric , intrinsically symmetrical , relativistic , decelerating flows .",
    "the models are based on those developed by lb for 3c31 , with modifications to the functional forms assumed for geometry , velocity , emissivity and magnetic field . in particular",
    ", we found that the variations of intrinsic parameters were not directly coupled to the geometry of the jets as defined by their outer isophotes .      in the _ flaring region _",
    "close to the nucleus , the jet radius @xmath52 can be fitted by a polynomial of the form @xmath78 , where @xmath35 is the distance from the nucleus . in the _",
    "outer region _ at larger distances , the jets are conical , with opening angles sufficiently small that they are almost cylindrical .",
    "the inferred angles to the line of sight are @xmath79 for b20326 + 39 and @xmath80 for b21553 + 24 .",
    "close to the nucleus the jets have high and approximately constant velocities @xmath76 .",
    "they decelerate rapidly over distances of @xmath81kpc to a constant asymptotic outer velocities @xmath82 .",
    "the velocities at the jet edges are consistent with @xmath310.7 of their on - axis values everywhere .",
    "the emissivity profiles along the jets can be divided into discrete regions , each with a power - law variation .",
    "the power - laws tend to be flatter further from the nucleus , although regions close to the nucleus ( where knots of emission are seen ) are modelled as bright plateaux with rapid decreases in emissivity at their ends . in the low - velocity regions",
    "after the jets have decelerated , the emissivity profiles are consistent with a simple , quasi - one - dimensional adiabatic model ; closer to the nucleus , the adiabatic approximation predicts too steep a decline of emissivity with distance .",
    "the fractional emissivity at the edge of the jets is @xmath310.25 everywhere .",
    "although the observed polarization structures of the two objects appear radically different , the main features of the magnetic - field evolution are similar in both cases : the principal differences result from projection . in both objects ,",
    "the field is dominated by the longitudinal component in the region close to the nucleus ; further out , the largest single component is toroidal .",
    "the radial field components are @xmath310.4 and @xmath310.2 of the total in b20326 + 39 and b21553 + 24 , respectively .",
    "no evidence for transverse structure in the field - component ratios is seen in either source .",
    "evolution from longitudinal to transverse field is qualitatively consistent with flux - freezing in an expanding , decelerating jet , but there are complications .",
    "first , the ratio of radial to toroidal field ( which should remain roughly constant even if there is velocity shear ) varies significantly along the jets .",
    "second , the details of the component evolution are quantitatively inconsistent with the flux - freezing picture",
    ".      we have modelled 3c31 with the modified functional descriptions used here in order to allow a quantitative comparison with other objects .",
    "as expected from the variation of sidedness ratio with distance from the nucleus ( lb ) , the jet velocity in 3c31 does not reach an asymptotic value in the modelled region .",
    "we have shown , however , that use of the new velocity law allows as good a fit to the observations as that achieved by lb and that their conclusions are not significantly modified .",
    "we have also successfully applied the model to the well - known radio galaxies ngc315 @xcite and 3c296 @xcite .",
    "these results will be presented in future papers .",
    "when suitable x - ray observations are available , we will apply the conservation - law approach developed by @xcite to infer the energy and momentum fluxes of the modelled jets and their variations of pressure , density and entrainment rate with distance from the nucleus .",
    "our eventual aim is to replace the empirical descriptions of internal quantities with more physically derived ones .",
    "initially , we will apply the more sophisticated adiabatic model developed by @xcite to the outer regions of the jets and in particular to b21553 + 24 , where the simple analysis of section [ adiabatic ] suggests that the adiabatic approximation holds over a large range of distances .",
    "we then plan to incorporate the effects of synchrotron and inverse compton losses in a self - consistent way , to model the observed emission from radio to x - ray wavelengths and to quantify the particle - acceleration processes in fri radio jets .",
