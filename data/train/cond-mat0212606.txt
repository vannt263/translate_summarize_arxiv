    "there are several important observations which will make based on the results presented on the this figure .",
    "first the curve obtained using the laterally averaged potential has a minimum at the density @xmath71 . at this equilibrium density the system forms a triangular lattice which fills the entire system and below this density the system undergoes a phase separation and forms a solid - vapor coexistence phase .",

    "up to a density one can notice that the presence of the substrate corrugations moves the minimum from @xmath72 at much higher energy",
    "but there is a feature at the same density produced by the @xmath9-@xmath9 interaction .",
    "the value @xmath72 of the equilibrium density for a smooth substrate plays a significant role even when the full potential with the substrate corrugations is used because it is the density which minimizes the energy due to @xmath9 molecule - molecule interaction . clearly due to this term which has a preference for a higher density than the commensurate density",
    ", the solid line is not convex which a sign of instability of a uniform phase .",
    "these results are obtained on lattices which frustrate the proper periodicity of the domain walls . if the calculations are done on lattice which can accommodate the periodicity of these superlattice structure the energy is lowered . as an example",

    "our studies of @xmath9 monolayer on graphite above 1/3 coverage clarifies the nature of the phase diagram .",
    "the boundaries of the phase diagram were well - known from the specific anomalies .",
    "we find that the phase near 1/3 coverage is the known @xmath74 commensurate solid . at higher densities the monolayer undergoes a transition to a uniaxially compressed solid with density wave stripe - like modulations along the same direction .",
    "this phase was first identified by leed@xcite studies ; while the subsequent neutron diffraction studies@xcite confirm the existence of ordered domains walls , the peak which is the signature of the uniaxial compression is not seen because of the ( 002 ) reflection from the underlying graphite lattice .",
    "in addition in both studies the domain walls are assumed to be superheavy . as it is clear from both our contour plots and our structure factor the walls are not significantly denser than the rest of the system",
    "; we find that the additional molecules added to the monolayer to increase the coverage above the commensurate coverage are used primarily to uniaxially compressed the solid and they are only partially used to construct the walls . our calculated specific heat for this coverage range as a function of temperature has two anomalies at two temperature values . from the calculated contour plots and the structure factor ,",
    "the lower temperature anomaly is identified as the transition from the ordered domain - wall solid to a solid where the domain walls form a fluid and the higher temperature anomaly is caused by the total melting of the solid to a uniform fluid .    at even higher density",
    "we find that the uniaxially compressed solid with the ordered domain walls undergoes a transition to a triangular solid which is incommensurate with respect to the substrate lattice and in addition the triangular solid of the adlayer is rotated by an angle of the order of @xmath75 with respect to the underlying substrate lattice .",
