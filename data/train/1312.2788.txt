    "starting approximately two decades ago , model specification testing of short - range dependent stationary time series has become a very active research field in both econometrics and statistics . in the meantime , estimation of long - range dependent stationary time series models has also been quite active . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "however , model specification of stationary time series with long - range dependence ( lrd ) has not been discussed in the literature .",
    "this is probably related to the unavailability of certain central limit theorems for weighted quadratic forms of stationary time series with lrd .",
    "specification test statistics based on nonparametric and semi - parametric techniques for both independent and short - range dependent cases have been proposed and studied extensively over the last two decades .",
    "recent studies have shown that some data sets may display lrd ( see , e.g. , beran @xcite ; cheng and robinson @xcite ; robinson @xcite ; baillie and king @xcite ; anh and heyde @xcite ; robinson @xcite ; gao @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , existing studies ( e.g. , hidalgo @xcite ; robinson @xcite ; csrg and mielniczuk @xcite ; mielniczuk and wu @xcite ) have examined nonparametric regression analysis of data with lrd .",
    "recent studies ( cheng and robinson @xcite ; anh _ et al . _ @xcite ; mikosch and starica @xcite ; gao and hawthorne @xcite ) have shown that some real data in economics , environment , and finance applications with both lrd and nonlinearities may be modeled by @xmath0 , where the regressors @xmath1 are either fixed designs or stationary short - range dependent variables , @xmath2 is an unknown and probably nonlinear trend function , and the errors @xmath3 are strictly stationary long - range dependent .",
    "in addition , the errors may be allowed for a more general dependent structure of the form @xmath4 as proposed by cheng and robinson @xcite and discussed by others , including mielniczuk and wu @xcite , where @xmath5 is a suitable function and @xmath6 is a possibly long - range dependent process .",
    "the key findings of these previous studies suggest that to avoid misrepresenting the mean function or the conditional mean function of long - range dependent data , we should let the data speak for themselves in terms of specifying the true form of the mean function or the conditional mean function .",
    "this is particularly important for data with lrd , because unnecessary nonlinearity or complexity in mean functions may cause erroneous lrd .    to address these issues",
    ", we propose to model data with possible lrd , nonlinearity , and non - stationary using a general nonparametric trend model .",
    "thus , one of the objectives of the present work is to specify the trend by constructing a nonparametric kernel - based test .",
    "consider a nonlinear time series model of the form @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the number of observations , @xmath9 is either a sequence of fixed designs of @xmath10 or random regressors , @xmath2 is an unknown function , and @xmath11 is a stationary long - range dependent linear process with @xmath12=0 $ ] and @xmath13=\\sigma ^2<\\infty$ ] .",
    "in addition , @xmath14 and @xmath11 are assumed to be independent for all @xmath15 when @xmath9 is a sequence of random regressors .",
    "we develop a kernel - based test for the hypotheses @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are vectors of unknown parameters , @xmath20 is a known parametric function of @xmath21 indexed by a vector of unknown parameters , @xmath22 , @xmath23 is some smooth function , and @xmath24 is a sequence of real numbers tending to 0 when @xmath25 . to ensure that the true model is identifiable , we also require that for all @xmath26 , there is a positive constant @xmath27 such that @xmath28 ^ 2 \\geq\\delta_1>0 $ ] in the random design case and @xmath29 in the fixed design case .",
    "note that under @xmath30 , model ( [ eq:1.1 ] ) becomes a parametric model of the form @xmath31 which covers many important cases .",
    "for example , model ( [ eq:1.3 ] ) becomes a simple linear model with lrd as in ( 1.1 ) of robinson and hidalgo @xcite when @xmath32 . for a given set of long - range dependent data , the acceptance of @xmath30 suggested by a test statistic may indicate that the mean function of the lrd data should be specified parametrically . in the case of the nile river data as analyzed by anh _",
    "@xcite , we would consider using a linear mean function of the form @xmath33 if a suitable test suggested the acceptance of @xmath34 .",
    "similarly , if a proper test suggested accepting a second - order polynomial function of the form @xmath35 as the true trend of a financial data set @xmath36 , then we would need only to difference @xmath36 twice to generate a stationary set of the data .",
    "although there is a long and rich literature in the field of model specification for time series models with stationarity ( see , e.g. , gao @xcite ; li and racine @xcite ) , little work has been reported on parametric specification testing of @xmath2 for the case where @xmath1 , @xmath3 , or both may be strictly stationary and long - range dependent time series . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "gao , wang and yin @xcite may be among the first to consider a parametric specification of @xmath2 for the case where @xmath9 is a sequence of stationary gaussian time series regressors with possible lrd and @xmath11 is a sequence of i.i.d . random errors .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we present our proposed test for the hypothesis ( [ eq:1.2 ] ) in section  [ sec2.1 ] . to investigate the proposed specification test , we investigate the limiting theorems for the leading term @xmath37 of our test in section [ sec2.2 ] , where @xmath38 with @xmath39 , in which @xmath40 is a probability kernel function and @xmath41 is a bandwidth parameter .",
    "we mention that for the case where @xmath9 is a sequence of either fixed or random regressors but @xmath11 is a sequence of long - range dependent errors , the problem of establishing limiting distributions for @xmath37 is difficult . because there is an involvement of @xmath42 into the inside of @xmath40 , existing central limit theorems for u - statistics of long - range dependent processes ( see hsing and wu @xcite ) are not applicable .",
    "thus , the limit theorems presented in section  [ sec2.2 ] are interesting and useful in and of themselves . in section  [ sec3 ]",
    "we discuss some important extensions and applications of the theory established in section  [ sec2 ] .",
    "we present a parametric bootstrap simulation procedure as well as some resulting properties for the fixed design situation in section  [ sec4 ] . in section  [ sec4 ]",
    "we also provide an example to demonstrate how to implement the proposed test and the bootstrap simulation procedure in practice . in section  [ sec5 ]",
    "we conclude the paper with some remarks on extensions .",

    ", we develop some new limiting distributions of weighted quadratic forms of dependent processes with lrd in section  [ sec2.2 ] . their proofs , along with other proofs ,",
    "are relegated to appendix  [ appa ] .",
    "let @xmath45 be a one - dimensional bounded probability density function and @xmath41 be a smoothing bandwidth .",
    "when @xmath36 is a sequence of long - range dependent random variables , the conventional kernel estimator of @xmath2 is defined by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the density estimate of the marginal density function , @xmath48 , of @xmath9 when @xmath9 is a sequence of stationary random regressors .",

    "one of the advantages of such test statistics is that both their large - sample and finite - sample properties are much less sensitive to the use of individual nonparametric estimation as well as the resulting estimation biases . to test the hypothesis ( [ eq:1.2 ] )",
    ", we therefore propose a kernel - based test statistic of the form @xmath51 for the case where @xmath9 is a sequence of stationary random regressors , with @xmath39 and @xmath52 , in which @xmath53 is a consistent estimator of @xmath18 under @xmath30 .",
    "for the case of fixed - design mean with lrd errors , we also suggest the same form of ( [ eq:2.4 ] ) with @xmath10 .",

    "<S> our finite - sample studies demonstrate that both the proposed theory and the simulation procedure work well , and that the proposed test has little size distortion and reasonable power .    , </S>"
