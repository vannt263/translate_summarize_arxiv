    "the x - ray emission of nearby normal spiral galaxies has been observed to be dominated by x - ray binaries ( xrb ; see fabbiano 1989 for a review ) .",
    "there is a strong correlation between the optical and x - ray luminosities of galaxies which is also consistent with an xrb population dominating the x - ray emission ( i.e. , assuming that xrb constitute an   constant fraction of stars in a galaxy ) .",
    "deep optical , ir and sub - mm surveys suggest that the peak of the cosmic star - formation lies at redshifts on the order of 1 - 2 or more @xcite .",
    "white & ghosh ( 1998 , hereafter wg98 ) predicted that x - ray binaries that form from this early star - formation activity should result in the enhancement of x - ray emission in galaxies , most notably around a redshift of 0.5 - 1.0 as the massive stars supernova forming low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxrbs ) containing neutron stars . or blackholes the lmxrbs containing neutron stars in turn evolve to form millisecond radio pulsars ( mrp ) , resulting in the observed distribution of xrb and mrp in the galaxy and nearby galaxies .",
    "further modeling by ghosh & white ( 2001 ; hereafter gw01 ) has been undertaken to refine their previous results , with the primary improvement being the use of more recent star - formation rate ( sfr ) history estimates ( e.g. , blain et al .",
    "these more recent sfr history estimates take into account sub - mm data which is sensitive to dusty ( and hence obscured ) high - redshift galaxies that would be missed by optical / uv surveys .",
    "the main impact of these modifications is that the current estimate of the enhancement of x - ray flux from galaxies ( due to lmxrb ) peaks at @xmath6 rather than @xmath7 .",
    "the modeling of wg98 and gw01 also includes the predictions for enhancements of high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxrb ) .",
    "we defer evaluation of the hmxrb enhancement for future work , but note here that since hmxrb have a much shorter evolutionary time scale than lmxrb , the hmxrb enhancement ( along with other effects of starburst activity ) would closely track the sfr history and therefore occur at higher redshifts than the lmxrb enhancement discussed here .    a test of these x - ray evolution models would be to evolve the local universe x - ray luminosity function and derive the number counts of galaxies expected at given flux levels ( i.e. , in a logn - logs diagram ) for comparison with deep x - ray surveys .",
    "unfortunately , the x - ray luminosity function of nearby galaxies is not known directly because the typical x - ray flux of galaxies is of order of @xmath8 ",
    "@xmath9 which is below the limiting flux of existing x - ray all - sky surveys ( e.g , the rosat all - sky survey has a limiting flux on the order of @xmath10 ",
    "@xmath11 ; voges et al .",
    "1999 ) . here",
    "we take an alternative approach which is to use the known x - ray / optical luminosity correlation given in @xcite , determined from einstein data , to estimate the x - ray luminosities and fluxes of galaxies in the hdf - n , where optical luminosities and redshifts have been established . since the expected x - ray flux of high - redshift galaxies is low , @xcite performed a stacking analysis of a _",
    "observation of the hdf - n .",
    "we show below that the x - ray flux distribution derived from our analysis is consistent with the galaxy flux signal detected by _ chandra_. a secondary goal of this paper is to estimate the logn - logs distribution of galaxies ( based on the hdf - n ) in order to predict x - ray number counts that could be detected by more sensitive surveys .",
    "as discussed above , our main goal is to estimate the x - ray flux and luminosity for galaxies based on their optical luminosity , the x - ray / optical luminosity correlation and x - ray luminosity evolution models .",
    "the hdf - n `` proper '' sample presented in @xcite contains redshifts and r - magnitudes for 125 galaxies spanning @xmath12 . the x - ray / optical correlation given in @xcite",
    "is based on b - band luminosities , so accordingly the observed r - band magnitudes must be converted to rest - frame b - band magnitudes .",
    "we used the k - correction plots in @xcite which include r to b band corrections based on optical and uv observations of galaxies ( which we caution only extends to z=0.6 ) , from which we derived the b - band luminosity for each galaxy ( we used @xmath13 and @xmath14 throughout this paper ) .",
    "here we are primarily interested in the mean properties of galaxies and accordingly did not segregate by galaxy type , which we differ to future work ( see also below ) .",
    "the k - corrections as a function of galaxy type vary by @xmath15 magnitude , which is somewhat larger than the scatter found for control galaxies by @xcite , and accordingly we assume an uncertainty of 1 magnitude .    these b luminosities were then converted to x - ray luminosities using the @xmath16 relation given in @xcite . assuming a power - law spectrum with a photon index of 1.8 and neutral absorption @xmath17 ( the galactic column towards the hdf - n is @xmath18 ; stark et al .",
    "1992 ) , which is consistent with an xrb - dominated spectrum and the observed 2 - 10 kev x - ray spectra of nearby galaxies ( c.f .",
    ", ptak et al . 1999 and references therein ) , @xmath19 to within @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , these same spectral assumptions also imply a @xmath21 flux that is @xmath22 ( at redshifts exceeding 0.5 , @xmath23 for all @xmath17 ) and we adopt 1.0 and 0.55 as the conversion factor to the 2.0 - 10.0 kev and 0.5 - 2.0 kev bandpasses .",
    "we also note that the stellar evolution models we are concerned with here are relevant only on long look - back time scales , and therefore only the lower - mass , older stellar populations have a significant impact in our analysis . ignoring the younger stellar populations biases our results in the sense of underestimating the expected x - ray flux for starburst systems which tend to exhibit enhanced supernovae and high - mass x - ray binary populations ( see fabbiano 1989 ) .",
    "since the @xcite correlation was performed using all galaxies types , the differing amount of x - ray production as a function of galaxy type inherently contributes to the scatter of the correlation .",
    "accordingly , the results of this paper should be accurate in a statistical sense but should not be applied to any individual galaxy .",
    "the resultant b and x - ray luminosity distributions derived from this procedure are shown in figure 1 .",
    "the errors given in this figure are derived from a monte - carlo approach in which the conversion to the b and x - ray bandpasses was repeated ( 1000 iterations ) with gaussian deviates with a standard deviation of 1 magnitude added to the resulant b magnitudes and gaussian deviates with standard deviation of 1 added to the log x - ray luminosities ( i.e. , simulating an order - of - magnitude scatter in @xmath24 ) .",
    "errors derived in this way were comparable to the counting errors that would be expected in each histogram bin ( i.e. , @xmath25 , where n = the number of galaxies in a given histogram bin ) .",
    "the mean galaxy @xmath26 is @xmath27 erg s@xmath5 , which is comparable to the mean value for passive galaxies given in @xcite of @xmath28 erg s@xmath5(after adjusting to our values of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "these values are somewhat lower than other nearby galaxies x - ray luminosity estimates ( e.g. , fabbiano , trinchieri , & mcdonal 1984 ) however it should noted that here and in @xcite active ( including narrow - line ) and starburst galaxies have not been ( explicitly ) included in the analyses .      we proceed now assuming that the ratio @xmath31 evolves as a result of an excess of x - ray binaries at earlier epochs .",
    "we use the evolutionary models `` peak - m '' and `` gaussian '' given in @xcite , plotted in figure 2 .",
    "both models are based on fits to the observed star - formation rate using optical / uv observations , however the `` gaussian '' model also includes a component with a gaussian functional form that takes into account the evolution of the ir luminosity function using ir and sub - mm data ( c.f . , blain et al .",
    "these models only take into account the relative change in x - ray luminosity as a function of redshift , however in this paper we are attempting to derive the x - ray luminosities of galaxies based on the rest - frame b - band luminosity .",
    "accordingly , any optical evolution must be taken into account explicitly before we could apply our x - ray evolution models . to this end",
    ", we took the mean and standard deviation of the b - band luminosities in redshift bins large enough to contain at least 20 galaxies and fit @xmath32 as a function of z with a linear model ( also shown in figure 2 ) .",
    "the x - ray luminosities were evolved by multiplying them by the ratio @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the x - ray and optical ( after normalizing to z=0 ) evolution models shown in figure 2 .",
    "the net amount of optical evolution derived in this way amounts to only a factor of @xmath36 from a redshift of 0 to 1 .",
    "applying these procedures , the mean 2 - 10 kev x - ray galaxy flux increased from @xmath37 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5   to 4.2 and @xmath38 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5   and the mean 2 - 10 kev x - ray luminosity increased from @xmath39 erg s@xmath5   to 5.3 and @xmath40 erg s@xmath5   for the `` peak - m '' and `` gaussian '' models , respectively ( with 0.5 - 2.0 kev values a factor of 0.55 lower as discussed above ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( before and after including evolution ) is shown in figures 1 and 3 .",
    "the flux density implied is 4.3 and @xmath43 in the 0.5 - 2.0 kev and 2 - 10 kev bandpasses , or 2 - 4% of the 2 - 10 kev x - ray background .",
    "@xcite find that the extra - galactic x - ray backround in the 1 - 2 kev bandpass is @xmath44 . with same spectral assumptions discussed above , @xmath45 , implying a 1 - 2 kev flux density of @xmath46 , or @xmath47 of the observed 1 - 2 kev background .",
    "we repeated our analysis after only including galaxies with redshifts in the range of 0.5 - 1.0 ( 55 galaxies ) which resulted in a mean 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux of @xmath48 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5(indicating that our results are dominated by galaxies in this redshift range ) .",
    "we proceed now to the question of the numbers of galaxies expected to be detected as a function of flux in ultra - deep _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , or future x - ray surveys . to address this",
    ", we derived the `` logn - logs '' number count distribution ( i.e. , the number of galaxies exceeding flux s as a function of flux ) implied by our analysis , shown in figure 4 , using the hdf - n area sited above .",
    "the galaxy number counts have been corrected for spectroscopic completeness using figure 1 from @xcite .",
    "this figure also shows the fits to the 0.5 - 2.0 kev and 2 - 10 kev hdf - s logn - logs distrubitions @xcite ( note that these curves are extrapolations below fluxes of @xmath49 and @xmath50 for the soft and hard bands , respectively ) . the 2 - 10 kev hdf - s logn - logs in the @xmath51 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5   range is in good agreement with the hdf - n logn - logs curve given in @xcite , where fluctuation analysis implies that the logn - logs curve flattens somewhat below @xmath52 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 .",
    "the total ( i.e. , including agn ) source densities determined by @xcite are marked which also implies a flattening of the x - ray logn - logs .",
    "note that the results of the stacking analysis in @xcite can not be plotted on this diagram since by design the analysis was done around optically - detected galaxies without significant x - ray counterparts and hence the area is not well defined .",
    "depending on the amount that the agn logn - logs flattens , the total x - ray logn - logs may become dominated by normal galaxies at fluxes below @xmath53  @xmath54 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , particularly in the soft band .",
    "we have estimated the x - ray fluxes of galaxies in the hubble deep field using the known x - ray / b - band luminosity correlation and taking evolution in the x - ray binary population of the galaxies into account ( using the `` gaussian '' and `` peak - m '' models in gw01 ) .",
    "here we are only attempting to estimate the lmxrb contribution to the galaxy fluxes , which should dominate the x - ray fluxes unless significant starburst and/or agn activity is present .",
    "the mean 2 - 10 kev x - ray flux that the gaussian model predicts is @xmath55 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5   which can be compared with @xmath56 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5  obtained from a stacking analysis of a 500 ks _",
    "observation of the hdf - n ( converted to the 2 - 10 kev bandpass from a signal of @xmath57 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5   in the 0.5 - 8.0 kev bandpass assuming the same spectrum as discussed above ) determined by @xcite .",
    "the `` peak - m '' model predicts a mean x - ray flux a factor of @xmath58 lower than the `` gaussian '' model .",
    "the `` gaussian '' model is therefore predicting a signal which is a factor of @xmath36 less than the signal observed , although we note that @xcite selected optically - bright galaxies ( a sample of 11 ) for their stacking analysis , and our estimate of the mean galaxy x - ray luminosity ( prior to the application of any evolution ) is evidently somewhat lower than that assumed by @xcite but is nevertheless consistent with other estimates . in both the hard and soft bandpass",
    ", we are predicting that galaxies make up @xmath59 of the x - ray background down to a flux of @xmath60 .",
    "the best test of these models would be the direct detection of high - z galaxies in the x - ray bandpass , obviously with sufficient spectroscopic identification to rule out an agn contribution to the x - ray flux .",
    "this would require an x - ray detection sensitivity on the order of @xmath61 erg @xmath4 s@xmath5 , which would imply an exposure on the order of 10 ms for _ chandra _",
    "( i.e. , the effective exposure in the stacking analysis was 5 ms ) , while even such a large exposure would be insufficient for _ xmm - newton _ to reach these detection sensitivites ( due to _ xmm - newton _ becoming background - limited at very large exposures ) .",
    "optical ( and , to a lesser extent , ir ) spectroscopic identifications could possibly miss highly - obscured agn or low - luminosity agn which would produce enhanced x - ray fluxes relative to normal galaxies .",
    "a simple expectation is that the x - ray emission of galaxies would be extended ( on spatial scales comparable to the optical emission ) , while the x - ray image of galaxies dominated by agn would of course be unresolved .",
    "the half - light radius of galaxies in the hst medium deep survey was typically @xmath62 , with a median value around @xmath63 @xcite .",
    "arcsecond resolution will therefore be necessary to detect any extension to galaxies .",
