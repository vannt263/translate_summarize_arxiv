    "the distance matrix of a graph , while not as common as the more familiar adjacency matrix , has nevertheless come up in several different areas , including communication network design @xcite , graph embedding theory @xcite , molecular stability @xcite , and network flow algorithms @xcite .",

    ", we study the largest eigenvalue of the distance matrix of a graph .    throughout this paper",

    "@xcite proposed the use of @xmath13 as a structure - descriptor , and it was successfully used to make inferences about the extent of branching and boiling points of alkanes@xcite .    in this paper , we determine the graph with @xmath0 cut vertices ( respectively , @xmath0 cut edges ) which has the minimal distance spectral radius .",
