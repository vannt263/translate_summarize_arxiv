    "the formation of co in the cool atmospheres of stars on the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) forces the chemistry of the dust produced by mass - losing stars to be either oxygen - rich or carbon - rich , depending on whether the c / o ratio in these stars is less than or more than one . in the galaxy ,",

    ". consequently , carbon - rich dust species are a small fraction of the material injected into the galactic ism compared to silicates and related oxygen - rich dust species .",
    "the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has a higher fraction of carbon stars than the galaxy @xcite , and the small magellanic cloud ( smc ) has a higher fraction still @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that reducing the initial metallicity of a star increases the likelihood that it will become a carbon star on the agb .",
    "more metal - poor stars have less oxygen in their atmospheres initially , so once they begin to dredge up carbon - rich material from the interior , fewer dredge - ups are needed to raise the c / o ratio past unity @xcite . as a result , the mass limit above which stars will evolve into carbon stars decreases as metallicity decreases . in the models with z=0.02 examined by @xcite , the limit is @xmath11.8  m@xmath2 ( depending on other assumptions ) , but for z=0.004 , the limit is @xmath11.3  @xmath3 .",

    "our measurements of the sic feature in the red sources in the galactic sample may be underestimated due to self - absorption , so the difference between the two samples may actually be larger .",
    "abundances of mg and si in the smc are about 15% of their solar values , based on measurements of the h ii region n88a @xcite and b supergiants @xcite .",
    "our measured dust strengths are roughly consistent with these abundance differences .",
    "the lower sic strengths in the bluer sources could be explained if they representd an older and more metal - poor sample .",
    "the five sources in the smc sample which show sic emission nearly as strong as their galactic counterparts are msx smc 054 , 091 , 105 , 159 , and 163 .",
    "four of these sources are also among the six showing a measurable mgs feature ; msx smc 091 is the exception .",
    "conversely , msx smc 036 and 060 are the two mgs sources which do nt show strong sic bands .",
    "as figure 8 shows , the five strong sic sources are all in the redder half of the sample in [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color .",
    "the mgs sources are grouped even more clearly ; the six reddest sources all show mgs features .",
    "figure 12 ( top ) shows that the strong sic sources also tend to have the reddest j@xmath5k colors .",
    "four of these sources are among the five reddest .",
    "msx smc 091 , again , is the exception , although it is still redder than half the sample .",
    "the one red source with j@xmath5k @xmath15 4 but without strong sic emission is msx smc 200 .",
    "figure 12 uses the photometry from sso .",
    "the 2mass photometry from an earlier epoch gives similar results , except that msx smc 060 is the one weak sic source among the reddest five in j@xmath5k .",
    "we have noted above that msx smc 060 and 200 have the most red - shifted sic features in our sample ; we could possibly be underestimating the strength of these features due to self - absorption .",
    "the middle panel of figure 12 shows that the strong sic sources are also among the redder sources in k@xmath5l , although the trend is not as obvious as it is in j@xmath5k .    given that the weakness of the sic and mgs features in the general sample is consistent with the expected lower abundances of @xmath17-capture products in the smc , it is conceivable that the sources with stronger sic features differ from the rest of the smc sample by having enhanced metallicities . if the metallicities resulted from comparative youth , then they might be located near younger clusters in the smc , but there is nothing significant about their locations in the smc .",
    "younger stars would have a higher mass , and on average , they might show a higher luminosity .",
    "however , as the bottom panel of figure 12 shows , only one of the eight sources with a bolometric luminosity @xmath15 10@xmath18 l@xmath19 has a strong sic feature .",
    "the strong sic sources cover a wide range of luminosities , although four of the five tend to cluster in the lower half of the luminosity range .",
    "the only clear distinctions between the strong sic sources and the remaining carbon stars are that they ( 1 ) tend to also show mgs dust and ( 2 ) tend to be redder than the remaining sample at j@xmath5k and to a lesser degree , k@xmath5l and [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] .",
    "these redder colors imply a greater amount of amorphous carbon in their dust shells .",
    "k color ( _ top _ ) , our sample plotted on a jkl color - color diagram ( _ middle _ ) , and bolometric luminosity vs. j@xmath5k color ( _ bottom _ ) .",
    "the strong sic sources are plotted with boxes .",
    "the photometry is from siding spring observatory ( sso ) , although it should be noted that the dependence on 2mass j@xmath5k@xmath6 colors is similar .",
    "the strong sic sources tend to be among the redder sources in our sample , especially at j@xmath5k .",
    " 2.4 explains how we estimated the bolometric luminosity .",
    "the strong sic sources are not among the brightest sources in the sample.,width=336 ]      the star msx smc 060 shows a rather unusual lightcurve ( figure 3 ) , and it has the reddest [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color in our sample of carbon stars .",
    "it shows evidence for a long period of about 450600 days , and when it is bright it shows a typical semi - regular ( low overtone ) pulsation with a period of 7085 days . in some ways ,",
    "this star is like an r crb star , undergoing episodic dimming events , a slow recovery , and then showing semi - regular pulsation when it is optically bright .",
    "photometrically , it is certainly as red in j@xmath5k and [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] as the two r crb stars in the smc observed with the irs @xcite , msx smc 014 and 155 .",
    "they have [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] = 0.92 and 0.77 , respectively , compared to 0.96 for msx smc 060 .",
    "the similarities in the light curve and photometry are interesting , even though the infrared spectrum of msx smc 060 differs significantly from the r crb stars , which show relatively featureless spectra , while msx smc 060 has clear acetylene bands , strong mgs dust emission , and moderate ( or possibly self - absorbed ) sic dust emission .",
    "two sources in figure 6 do not follow the general relation between [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] and j@xmath5k@xmath6 colors , showing bluer colors at [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] than expected from the j@xmath5k colors in the 2mass epoch .",
    "they are msx smc 066 and 200 , and they have j@xmath5k@xmath6 colors in the 2mass epoch of 3.58 and 3.66 , respectively . in the sso photometry ,",
    "msx smc 066 has dropped to j@xmath5k = 3.04 , among the bluest colors in our sample , while msx smc 200 has reddened to 4.49 , among the reddest colors in our sample .",
    "the variability of msx smc 066 might explain why it stands out in figure 6 , but msx smc 200 has remained red at j@xmath5k , making its blue [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color more difficult to explain .",
    "the two sources illustrated in figure 11 , msx smc 093 and 232 , are outliers in figure 10 because their sic features have shifted from @xmath111.3  to @xmath111.0  .",
    "as explained in  4.2 , this shift may arise from an increased size in the emitting grains , even though the sic dust is more optically thin .",
    "the c@xmath0h@xmath0 absorption bands are stronger in the smc sample than in the galactic sample , indicating that these molecules are more abundant in the atmospheres and outflows of carbon stars in the smc .",
    "this result reinforces previous results based on 34-  spectra of carbon stars in the magellanic clouds and the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy @xcite .",
    "these papers suggest that the increased abundance of c@xmath0h@xmath0 results from a higher c / o ratio in low - metallicity carbon stars , which arises for two reasons .",
    "first , as the metallicity drops , the dredge - ups will grow more efficient @xcite , injecting more carbon into the atmosphere .",
    "second , low - metallicity agb stars have a lower oxygen abundance to begin with , increasing the c / o ratio for a given amount of dredged up carbon @xcite .",
    "the analysis in this paper uses the [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color as a proxy for the relative contributions of emission from the amorphous carbon dust and the stellar photosphere .",
    "figure 7 shows that at a given [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color , carbon stars in the smc have more acetylene absorption than their galactic counterparts .",
    "thus , if our assumptions are correct , the carbon stars in the smc have more acetylene around them than carbon stars _ with the same amount of dust _ in the galaxy .",
    "lrcc weak sic & 6 & 0.141@xmath100.069 & 0.053@xmath100.017 + strong sic & 5 & 0.183@xmath100.038 & 0.064@xmath100.024    @xcite suggested acetylene as a probable building block of aromatic hydrocarbons in circumstellar shells , and numerical models support this mechanism @xcite .",
    "carbonaceous grains with a mixture of aliphatic and aromatic bonds can also be produced from acetylene , as shown by @xcite .",
    "the acetylene probably does not condense directly into solid material .",
    "a nucleation site provides a surface for the formation of carbonaceous solids in the outflows from carbon stars , and @xcite and @xcite have identified sic as the most likely nucleation site .",
    "our observations of the smc reveal less sic and mgs in the dust compared to the galactic sample , raising another possible explanation for the excess acetylene seen in the smc spectra besides the higher expected c / o ratios .",
    "the lower metallicity in the smc leads to lower abundances of heavier elements such as si , mg , and s and fewer related dust grains . with less sic to form the nuclei for the condensation of carbon ,",
    "the dust formation may be less efficient , which might in turn explain the deeper acetylene absorption for a given amount of carbon - rich dust in the smc ( figure 7 ) .",
    "while this scenario seems plausible , the five strong sic sources in our sample do not follow the expected trend .",
    "since the sic emission in these sources is nearly as strong as the galactic sources , one might expect more efficient dust formation to leave less acetylene compared to the sources with weaker sic features .",
    "table 6 compares the mean band strengths for the acetylene in the strong sic sources to the same control sample of weak sic sources in table 5 .",
    "the distributions of the molecular band strengths overlap significantly .",
    "if anything , the strong sic emitters have stronger absorption bands .",
    "while the five strong sic sources do not seem to support the scenario we propose , one must keep in mind that we have been unable to determine why these sources have so much sic in their dust shells .",
    "they may represent an unusual population and thus make a poor test sample .",
    "the trends when comparing the overall galactic and smc samples are still clear .",
    "we have been careful to base our comparisons on sources with similar amounts of dust , which is quite different from a comparison of the amount of dust produced by similar sources in the smc and the galaxy .",
    "a definitive answer will require radiative transfer modelling to properly measure the amount of amorphous carbon dust and a careful assessment of the luminosities and pulsational properties of the stars .",
    "we leave that work to the future , but we note in the meantime that the irs spectra and the derived [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] colors clearly indicate that carbon stars in the smc are capable of producing significant quantities of dust .",
    "analyzing the strength of identifiable spectral features as a function of [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color allows us to separate the sample on the basis of the optical depth through the dust shell , which is effectively a measure of the amount of amorphous carbon around the star .",
    "thus we can compare the carbon stars in the smc sample to sources with a similar amount of circumstellar dust in the galactic sample .",
    "carbon stars in the smc have lower abundances of sic and mgs dust compared to the amorphous carbon dust than their galactic counterparts .",
    "this result demonstrates that the nature of the dust produced by stars on the agb can vary measurably with their initial metallicity .",
    "our observations of molecular band strengths confirm the shorter - wavelength results of @xcite and @xcite who showed that stars with lower metallicities actually produce deeper acetylene absorption bands .",
    "they attributed this unexpected result to significantly higher c / o ratios in these stars .",
    "we have made our comparison on the basis of the [ 6.4]@xmath5[9.3 ] color , allowing us to conclude that stars surrounded by similar amounts of dust have more acetylene around them in the smc than in the galaxy , and have proposed an alternative scenario .",
    "the lack of sic dust in the shells may deprive the amorphous carbon of seeds , lead to less efficient dust formation , and result in a higher ratio of acetylene to amorphous carbon .",
    "finally , we note that the combination of our results and previous work suggest that more carbon - rich dust should be injected into the ism in a more metal - poor galaxy .",
    "first , a higher fraction of the stars evolve into carbon stars .",
    "second , individual carbon stars in these metal - poor systems produce quantities of dust comparable to their galactic counterparts , as our spectroscopy has shown .",
    "finally , oxygen - rich stars should not produce as much dust , since the limiting factors will be the abundances of heavier elements like mg , al , si , and fe , all of which will be reduced in low - metallicity environments . since amorphous carbon is the likely building block for pah molecules , this result has important implications for the study of the emission features produced by these molecules in distant and/or metal - poor galaxies .",
