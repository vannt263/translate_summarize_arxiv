    "the sum rule has been checked experimentally at @xmath2=5 gev@xmath1 to better than 10% .",
    "as recently realized , the bjorken sum rule is related to a more general sum rule , the generalized gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite : @xmath5 since the generalized gdh sum is , in principle , calculable at any @xmath2 , it can be used to study the transition from the partonic to hadronic degrees of freedom of the strong force . however , the validity domains for chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath6pt ) at low @xmath2 and pqcd calculations at higher @xmath2 used to calculate the gdh sum do not overlap .",
    "the bjorken sum is the flavor non - singlet part of the gdh sum .",
    "this leads to simplifications that may help in linking the ( @xmath6pt ) validity domain to the pqcd validity domain @xcite .",
    "hence the bjorken sum appears as a key quantity to study the hadron - parton transition .",

    "the data agree well with models @xcite and also with eq .  1 calculated to third order in @xmath8 and to leading twist .",
    "the agreement between the data and the leading twist calculation down to quite low @xmath2 indicates that overall higher twist effects @xcite are small .",
    "@xmath10 can be extracted from eq .  1 if higher twists are known or negligible .",

    "consequently , theoretical calculations of the running coupling constant deal only with dressed propagators .",
    "we can assume that , in order to compare to non - perturbative calculations of @xmath9 , we do not need to include in @xmath9 the gluon bremsstrahlung and vertex corrections .",
