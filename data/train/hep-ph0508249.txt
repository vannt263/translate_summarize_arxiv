    "the detection of new particles in central exclusive production at the lhc has received a great deal of attention recently ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) . by central exclusive production",
    ", we refer to the process @xmath1 , where @xmath2 denotes the absence of hadronic activity ( ` gap ' ) between the outgoing protons and the decay products of the central system @xmath3 , shown schematically in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) . an example would be standard model higgs boson production , for which the central system could consist of either 2 b - quark jets or the decay products of two w bosons , and no other activity .",
    "khoze et al .",
    "calculate the cross section for the central exclusive production of a 120 gev standard model higgs boson to be @xmath4 fb at the lhc , falling to @xmath5 fb at @xmath6 gev @xcite , and orders of magnitude larger for certain mssm scenarios @xcite .",
    "this is large enough to be observable , and there is currently a proposal to install forward proton detectors as a future upgrade to the lhc experiments @xcite .",
    "it is therefore important to confront the kmr calculations with data as soon as possible , in particular by searching for high - rate central exclusive processes at the tevatron .",
    "there are several exclusive processes which , according to the kmr calculations , should have large enough cross sections to be observable now .",
    "the two cleanest signatures are central exclusive @xmath7 meson production and central exclusive di - photon production .",
    "these processes are under study by both the cdf and d  collaborations , although at the time of writing , no results have been published . by far",
    "the highest rate process is predicted to be central exclusive di - jet production .",
    "di - jet production in the inclusive process @xmath8 , where @xmath9 can be any centrally produced system , was studied by the cdf collaboration in the tevatron run i data @xcite .",
    "this process , often termed double pomeron exchange , is conventionally modelled as shown in figure 1(b ) . in regge - inspired language , it can be pictured as the emission of two pomerons ( or reggeons if the longitudinal momentum loss of the protons is large ) which collide to produce the central system @xmath9 .",
    "since the pomerons have a partonic structure , described by structure functions , there are necessarily always pomeron remnants ; that is to say there are no truly exclusive events in this picture .    [ fig1 ]    ( 150,70)(0,0 ) ( 0,0 ) ( 75,0 )    whilst from a theoretical perspective , the exclusive process is distinctly different from the inclusive , from an experimental viewpoint the definition of exclusive and inclusive is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "the approach adopted by the cdf collaboration is to define the quantity @xmath10 as the fraction of the invariant mass of the central system contained within the two highest @xmath0 jet cones .",
    "if the cone radius is large enough such that out of cone effects are small , then @xmath10 should be peaked at or near @xmath11 for exclusive events since there will be no pomeron remnants .",
    "if the exclusive process is present with a large enough cross section relative to double pomeron exchange then an excess of events over that predicted by the regge models should be observable at high @xmath10 .    in this paper",
    ", we carry out a monte carlo simulation of di - jet production in double pomeron exchange , and compare directly to the run i data .",
    "we use the pomwig monte carlo generator to simulate the inclusive double pomeron exchange process @xcite , and exhume @xcite to simulate the exclusive contribution , as calculated by kmr . an alternative model for the exclusive process , based on the calculations of bialas and landshoff ( bl ) @xcite ,",
    "is implemented in the dpemc monte carlo @xcite .",
    "there are two key differences between the bl and the kmr approaches .",
    "firstly , in the kmr model , the two gluons at the proton vertex couple perturbatively to the off - diagonal unintegrated gluon distribution of the proton . in the bl approach ,",
    "the proton vertex is treated as non - perturbative , and parameterised using a regge - motivated ansatz .",
    "this leads to a significant difference in the rapidity distributions of the central system ; in the bl approach the rapidity distribution is much flatter , since the cross section has only a weak @xmath12-dependence , entering via the soft pomeron intercept , whilst in the kmr model there is a much stronger @xmath12-dependence from the gluon distributions in the protons .",
    "secondly , the cross section falls much more quickly as the di - jet @xmath0 increases in the kmr model .",
    "this is a reflection of the fact that the phase space for gluon emission into the gap increases as @xmath0 increases , and therefore the exclusive cross section decreases .",
    "this effect is not present in the bl approach .",
    "as we shall see , this phase space effect has observable consequences which could allow the two models to be separated in the tevatron run ii data .",
    "cdf have also recently presented high statistics preliminary results on diffractive di - jet production in run ii @xcite . since",
    "the run ii results are only preliminary at the time of writing , we do not compare directly , but make a prediction based on the kinematic range quoted in @xcite .",
    "our aim is to assess whether the exclusive process should be visible in the cdf data .",
    "to simulate the exclusive process , we use both the exhume 1.3.1 generator @xcite , interfaced to pythia 6.205 @xcite for parton showering and hadronisation , and dpemc 2.4 @xcite . to simulate the double pomeron exchange process",
    ", we use pomwig 1.3 @xcite .",
    "pomwig simulates diffractive collisions using a regge factorisation ansatz , with the parameters of the pomeron and reggeon flux terms and structure functions extracted from diffractive dis data by the h1 collaboration at hera @xcite .",
    "the pomwig model generates only the inclusive process of figure 1(b ) - i.e. there will always be pomeron remnants in the event .",
    "we use the default pomwig parameters as described in @xcite , with one exception .",
    "the default pomwig behaviour up to v1.2 was to treat the pomeron ( and reggeon ) remnants in the same way that herwig treats the photon remnants , i.e. the valence partons in the pomeron and reggeon are defined to be quark - antiquark pairs .",
    "pomwig v1.3 introduces the option to define the valence partons in the pomeron to be gluons .",
    "it is this option that we take to be the default behaviour for the pomeron in this paper . for the reggeon",
    ", we define the valence partons to be quarks , as in version 1.2 .",
    "we discuss the effects of the different remnant treatments in section 4 .",
    "pomeron and reggeon exchanges are generated separately , and added according to their generated cross sections .",
    "pomwig does not include a model of gap survival probability , and therefore over - estimates diffractive cross sections at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "the approach we adopt is to scale the final pomwig prediction , after the experimental cuts and smearing described in section [ results ] , to the cdf run i measurement @xcite .",
    "this assumes that the gap survival factor is independent of kinematic effects , which is probably a reasonable approximation given the level of accuracy we are working to here . in the exclusive case ,",
    "the gap survival factor is a prediction of the kmr model .",
    "we use the exhume default value of @xmath13 = 0.045 at the tevatron for both exhume and dpemc .",
    "the normalisation of the exhume cross section is particularly sensitive to the gluon distribution in the proton ( which enters roughly speaking to the fourth power ) .",
    "we use the mrst2002 parton distribution functions @xcite as the exhume default . to gain some estimate of the uncertainty",
    ", we also use the cteq6 m pdfs @xcite in our run ii predictions , which lead to a larger cross section prediction .",
    "we first turn our attention to the published cdf run i results @xcite .",
    "cdf have proton tagging detectors only on the outgoing anti - proton side of the experiment .",
    "tagging the outgoing @xmath14 restricts its longitudinal momentum loss to the range @xmath15 , and the transverse momentum @xmath16 gev@xmath17 . on the outgoing proton side , cdf have no proton taggers , so the analysis relies on the observation of a rapidity gap ( i.e. no particles above a noise threshold ) in the forward detectors , covering the range @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to an approximate range of proton longitudinal momentum loss @xmath19 . following the cdf analysis ,",
    "jets are found using the cone algorithm with cone radius @xmath20 . in table 1",
    "we show the generated cross sections from pomwig , exhume and dpemc in the cdf run i kinematic range @xcite , defined as follows ; @xmath21 we note that , at the hadron level , pomwig overshoots the measured cross section by a factor of @xmath22 .",
    "this would imply an effective gap survival factor of 0.14 . as we shall see below however , a combination of the smearing of the monte carlo , and the rapidity gap definition used by cdf to calculate the measured cross section , changes this result by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    ".generator level cross sections and cdf data for run 1 .",
    "the pomwig result has no effective survival factor applied as this is calculated using the smeared data .",
    "@xmath10 is calculated by using the generated @xmath24 values and unsmeared final state hadrons . [",

    "we have shown that the published cdf run 1 double pomeron exchange data do not rule out the presence of an exclusive component at the level predicted by khoze , martin and ryskin ( kmr ) .",
    "the dpemc prediction is also not ruled out by the run i results .",
    "looking forward to the tevatron run ii data , we have made a prediction for the di - jet mass fraction , @xmath10 , based on the pomwig monte carlo , which we scale to the run i measured cross section , and the absolute prediction of the kmr model from exhume . at the time of writing , only preliminary results are available for the high - statistics",
    "run ii data . in the absence of final ,",
    "published results , we present hadron level predictions , in the kinematic range used in the preliminary analysis @xcite .",
    "as is clear from figure 5 and table 3 , pomwig generates fewer events at @xmath25 than exhume . with sufficient statistics , and",
    "if detector effects are corrected for , we might therefore expect the @xmath10 distribution in the data to be higher than the pomwig prediction at @xmath25 .",
    "this could be interpreted as a sign of an exclusive component in the data , given that pomwig is able to adequately model the high @xmath10 region .",
    "this is an assumption , but we believe it to be a reasonable one , for the following reason . in order to produce more events at large @xmath10 , the pomeron structure function would have to be larger at high-@xmath26 than it is in pomwig . in figure 7",
    ", we compare the effect of varying the structure function by comparing the pomwig default ( h1 fit 2 @xcite ) to the h1 fit 3 peaked gluon .",
    "even with the relatively extreme high-@xmath26 behaviour of the h1 fit 3 gluon distribution ( which is certainly too large ) , an excess at high @xmath10 would still be present in the data above the pomwig prediction if an exclusive component at the level predicted by kmr is present , since the cross section from exhume alone is as large or larger than the pomwig h1 fit 3 prediction in the highest @xmath10 bins . as discussed above ,",
    "there is an uncertainty in the absolute magnitude of the kmr prediction , which is largely due to the uncertainty in the knowledge of the gluon distributions of the proton . in figure 7",
    "we also show the exhume prediction using the cteq6 m parton distributions ( see also table 3 ) . in this case",
    ", the excess over the pomwig prediction is larger .",
    "the treatment of the pomeron remnant can also have an effect on the pomwig predictions at high @xmath10 . as discussed in section 2",
    ", pomwig v1.3 introduces the option of defining the pomeron valence partons to be either quarks or gluons . since in the h1 picture",
    ", the pomeron is predominantly a gluonic object , the more natural choice is to define the valence partons to be gluons . in figure 8",
    "we compare the @xmath10 distributions when the pomeron valence partons are defined to be quarks ( the pomwig default behaviour prior to v1.3 ) or gluons .",
    "the pomwig prediction is significantly lower at high @xmath10 for the quark case .",
    "this is because in di - jet production , the parton entering the hard scatter from the pomeron is more likely to be a gluon .",
    "if the valence partons in the pomeron are defined to be quarks , herwig will be forced to continue parton showering until a quark - antiquark pair is produced .",
    "this results in increased activity in the remnant region , and hence high @xmath10 values are less likely .    both the dpemc and pomwig models have significantly different jet @xmath0 dependences to exhume ( with both the cteq6 m and mrst2002 partons distributions ) , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "the steeper jet @xmath0 dependence seen in exhume is a direct result of the fact that the kmr model takes account of the increasing phase space for gluon emission as @xmath0 increases . if , on the other hand , the high @xmath10 events are due to the tail of a pomwig ( or a dpemc ) - like model , then a flatter @xmath0 dependence should be observed .",
    "the jet @xmath0 distribution in the high @xmath10 region is therefore a possible test for the presence of a perturbative exclusive component ( i.e. kmr ) in the double pomeron di - jet data .",
