    "first observed in the @xmath5 meson system at argus , the neutral b meson transition from the particle to anti - particle state , and vice versa , occurs through a second order weak transition or `` box diagram '' .",
    "the frequency of the oscillation is proportional to the small difference in mass between the two eigenstates , @xmath6 , and for the @xmath5 system can be translated into a measurement of the ckm element @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath7 can be used to constrain the unitarity triangle and thereby yield information on the _ cp _ violating phase @xcite .",
    "@xmath2 has been precisely measured ( the world average is @xmath8 @xcite ) but large theoretical uncertainties dominate the extraction of @xmath7 from @xmath2 . this problem can be reduced if the @xmath9 mass difference , @xmath10 , is also measured .",
    "@xmath7 can then be extracted with better precision from the ratio : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is estimated from lattice qcd calculations to be @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "the above has motivated many experiments to search for @xmath9 oscillations and though a statistically significant signal hasnt been observed yet , a lower limit ( @xmath14 ps@xmath15 at 95% c.l . ) has been set .",
    "since this current limit indicates that the @xmath9 oscillations are at least 30 times faster than the @xmath16 oscillations , a @xmath9 mixing measurement is experimentally very challenging .",
    "the d  experiment at the fermilab tevatron , a @xmath17 collider at 1.96 tev center of mass energy , is well equipped to search for @xmath9 oscillations .",
    "the large muon acceptance and forward tracking coverage of the d  detector ( pseudorapidity coverage of @xmath18 for the muon , @xmath19 for the tracking and @xmath20 for the silicon sub - detectors ) , along with a robust muon trigger are highly effective in exploiting the large @xmath21 cross - section resulting in some of the largest semileptonic @xmath9 yields .",
    "[ dsphipi ] shows the yield for the decay @xmath22 in @xmath3250 pb@xmath15 of data .",
    "the decay @xmath23 has also been reconstructed and is expected to contribute significantly to the total @xmath9 yield .",
    "other decays including hadronic @xmath9 decays are being studied as well .",
    "other elements essential to a mixing analysis are given by the expression for the average statistical significance : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the number of signal events , @xmath26 is a measure of the effectiveness of a flavor tagger ( @xmath27 is the tagging efficiency while @xmath28 is the `` dilution '' ) , @xmath29 is the number of background events and @xmath30 is the proper time resolution .    as indicated above ,",
    "tagging the meson flavor ( @xmath9 or @xmath31 ) at decay time ( final - state tagging ) and at production time ( initial - state tagging ) are crucial . for the semileptonic modes used for mixing studies at d",
    "the final state particles provide the decay - time tag . for initial - state tagging ,",
    "different techniques are being studied and optimized by doing measurements of @xmath2 .",
    "three tagging algorithms have been developed so far : opposite - side muon tagging , opposite - side jet charge tagging , and same - side ( soft - pion ) tagging .",
    "the muon tagger relies on identifying the flavor of the other b meson in the event using the sign of the muon it decayed to - a negative muon corresponds to a @xmath32 quark , and vice - versa . for the decay used for @xmath16 mixing studies - @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 - both muons having the same sign would indicate that one b hadron had oscillated while opposite signs would indicate that neither ( or both ) had oscillated .",
    "[ mixing_slt ] shows the measured asymmetry between the non - oscillated and oscillated mesons as a function of the visible proper decay length ( vpdl ) .",
    "the fit to the asymmetry gives @xmath36 ps@xmath15 with an efficiency of @xmath37 % and @xmath38 % .",
    "the opposite - side jet charge tagging algorithm calculates a @xmath39-weighted average charge of tracks : @xmath40 .",
    "a @xmath41 value corresponds to a @xmath32 quark for the b meson on the opposite side , and vice - versa .",
    "the same - side pion tagging algorithm makes use of the fact that the charge of the fragmentation pion correlates with the flavor of the reconstructed b meson .",
    "a positive pion corresponds to a @xmath42 quark ( i.e. @xmath16 ) if the reconstructed @xmath29 meson is neutral , but to a @xmath32 quark ( i.e. @xmath43 ) if the reconstructed @xmath29 meson is charged , and vice versa .",
    "oscillations have been seen using both the opposite - side jet - charge and the same - side pion taggers , and work is ongoing to compute systematics errors and optimize performance .",
    "lastly , since the significance scales as @xmath44 , for large values of @xmath10 , a precise measurement of the proper decay time is crucial . efforts are ongoing in this direction and we hope to have preliminary @xmath10 results soon .",
    "a preliminary measurement of @xmath2 has been made with the upgraded d  detector .",
    "the opposite - side soft muon tagger was used to obtain @xmath36 ps@xmath15 .",
    "this measurement , along with the development and optimization of other tagging algorithms , and the reconstruction of different @xmath45 decay modes , is an important step towards a @xmath0 mixing measurement .",
