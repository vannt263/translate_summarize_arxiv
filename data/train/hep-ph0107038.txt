    "light - cone hamiltonian diagonalization methods offer a number of attractive advantages for solving nonperturbative problems in quantum field theory , such as a physical minkowski space description , boost invariance of the bound - state wave functions , no requirement for fermion doubling , and a consistent fock - state expansion well matched to physical problems . in the discretized light - cone quantization ( dlcq )",
    "method , the light - cone hamiltonian @xmath0 of a quantum field theory is diagonalized on a discrete fock basis defined by assuming periodic boundary conditions in the light - cone coordinates  @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath0 give the mass spectrum of the theory , and the respective eigenfunctions projected on the free fock basis provide the frame - independent light - cone wave functions needed for phenomenology  @xcite including the amplitudes needed to compute exclusive @xmath1 decays  @xcite , deeply virtual compton scattering  @xcite , and other hard exclusive processes  @xcite .",
    "the dlcq method has been successfully used to solve a large number of one - space and one - time theories  @xcite , including supersymmetric gauge theories  @xcite .",
    "it also has found application in analyzing confinement mechanisms  @xcite , string theory  @xcite , and @xmath2-theory  @xcite .    the application of dlcq to physical , ( 3 + 1)-dimensional space - time quantum field theories is computationally challenging because of the rapid growth of the number of degrees of freedom as the size of the fock representation grows .",
    "a promising alternative is the transverse lattice method  @xcite which combines light - cone methods in the longitudinal light - cone direction with a space - time lattice for the transverse dimensions .",
    "recently dalley  @xcite and burkhart and seal  @xcite have extended the transverse lattice method to estimate the shape of the valence light - cone wave function of a pion , a key input to much hadron phenomenology .",
    "burkhart and seal have also given an explicit calculation of the isgur  wise function for semileptonic @xmath1 decays  @xcite .",
    "another major difficulty in applying dlcq to quantum field theory in 3 + 1 dimensions is the implementation of a nonperturbative renormalization method .",
    "most methods of regulating nonperturbative calculations in the light - cone representation , such as momentum cutoffs , do not allow a correct renormalization even of perturbative calculations .",
    "the problem can be traced to the fact that any momentum cutoff violates lorentz invariance as well as gauge invariance  @xcite . since",
    "dimensional regularization is not available in dlcq , one needs to introduce new fields or degrees of freedom to render the ultraviolet behavior of the theory finite .",
    "one intriguing possibility is to analyze ultraviolet - finite supersymmetric theories and then introduce breaking of the theory .",
    "the heavy supersymmetric partners then regulate the ordinary sector of the theory in a manner analogous to pauli ",
    "villars ( pv ) regulation  @xcite .",
    "string theory also provides mechanisms for regulating quantum field theory at short distances which are equivalent to an infinite spectrum of pv particles  @xcite .",
    "the introduction of pv fields can thus regulate a theory covariantly , after which the discretized momentum grid of dlcq acts only as a numerical tool in the manner of performing a numerical integral .    in our previous work  @xcite",
    "we have shown that a model field theory in 3 + 1 dimensions can be solved by combining dlcq with pv regulation of the ultraviolet regime . in our first application",
    "@xcite , a model theory was constructed to have an exact analytic solution by which the dlcq results could be checked , for both accuracy and rapidity of convergence .",
    "the model was regulated in the ultraviolet by a single pv boson , which was included in the dlcq fock basis in the same way as the `` physical '' particles of the theory .",
    "we then extended this approach to a more realistic model which mimics many features of a full quantum field theory  @xcite . unlike the analytic model which contained a static source , the light - cone energies of the particles in this model have the correct longitudinal and transverse momentum dependence .",
    "an important question is whether the generalized pv method with a finite number of fields can regulate a field theory at all orders .",
    "paston and franke  @xcite have studied the relation between perturbation theory in the light - cone representation and standard feynman perturbation theory , and they have developed general rules for testing regularization procedures . for full yukawa theory , paston , franke and prokhvatilov  @xcite",
    "have shown that one pv boson and two pv fermions can regulate the theory in such a way as to allow a correct perturbative renormalization .    in this paper",
    "we shall apply generalized pv regularization and discrete light - cone quantization to the nonperturbative solution of ( 3 + 1)-dimensional yukawa theory in a single - fermion truncation .",
    "we allow any number of bosons in the yukawa theory but only one fermion in the fock representation ; fermion pair terms and any other terms that involve anti - fermions are neglected . we shall thus consider a field - theoretic model where one particle , which we take to be a fermion of mass @xmath2 , acts as a dynamical source and sink for bosons of mass @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , three heavy pv scalars , including two with negative norm , will be used to regulate the theory so that the chiral properties of the renormalized theory are maintained , at least to one loop in perturbation theory .",
    "in particular , the mass of the renormalized fermion constituent vanishes as its bare mass vanishes .",
    "a distinct advantage of our approach is that the counterterms are generated automatically by the pv particles and their negative - metric couplings .",
    "we emphasize that the pv fields are added from the beginning , at the lagrangian level , to facilitate our nonperturbative calculations , rather than being invoked for subtractions at a diagrammatic level , which would limit the implementation to perturbation theory .",
    "note that the pv fields enter singly , doubly or triply at all three - point vertices .",
    "this contrasts with use of generalized pauli ",
    "villars spectral integrals over mass to regulate divergences .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom of the pv scalars and their negative - metric couplings introduce new computational challenges .",
    "however , the matrix eigenvalue problem can be solved for the lowest - mass state by the use of a new , indefinite - metric lanczos algorithm which we describe in an appendix .",
    "we also calculate the light - cone wave function of each fock - sector component and the values for various physical quantities , such as average multiplicities and average momenta of constituents , bosonic and fermionic structure functions , and a form factor slope .",
    "we also verify that with our choice of pv conditions , the dlcq calculations of the nonperturbative theory at weak coupling coincide with the covariant perturbation theory through one loop , although numerical resolution does start to become a problem even on a supercomputer .    in our convention ,",
    "we define light - cone coordinates  @xcite by @xmath4 the time coordinate is taken to be @xmath5 .",
    "the dot product of two four - vectors is @xmath6 thus the momentum component conjugate to @xmath7 is @xmath8 , and the light - cone energy is @xmath9 .",

    "the boundary conditions in the longitudinal direction are chosen to be periodic for the boson fields but antiperiodic for the fermion field .",
    "this means that the integers @xmath54 are even for bosons , and the corresponding fermion momentum index is odd . the harmonic resolution @xmath55 is then also odd for the single - fermion state considered here .",

    "no _ a priori _ constraint on the number of bosonic constituents was necessary ; however , since the fermion constituent was treated as heavy , states containing fermion  anti - fermion pairs were truncated .",
    "we have found that the eigensolution at strong coupling displays features which significantly deviated from first - order perturbation theory . numerical resolution in this domain of strong coupling was not a limiting factor in this analysis .    the regularization procedure which we have chosen , with three pv scalars , functioned well .",
    "however , better convergence of the dlcq method at strong coupling could be obtained by constraining the pv couplings non - perturbatively , rather than using the one - loop perturbative constraints in ( [ eq : constraints ] ) .",
    "a number of properties of the yukawa - theory eigensolution could be extracted from its light - cone fock - state wave function .",
    "this illustrates the power of the dlcq method in making the fock - state wave functions of the eigenstates explicitly available .",

    "extension of these methods to pseudo - scalar yukawa theory would make the n@xmath96 connection stronger .",
    "although the approach used in this paper to solve ( 3 + 1)-dimensional yukawa theory at strong coupling has been successful , future progress for solving other quantum field theories will require more efficient analytic methods and numerical algorithms .",
    "an alternative ultraviolet regularization procedure , using only one pv scalar and one pv fermion  @xcite may potentially provide a more efficient approach for solving yukawa theories .",
    "not only is the constraint on the couplings trivial , but the light - cone hamiltonian is also much simpler .",
    "the simplifications occur because the instantaneous fermion interactions ( the terms in ( [ eq : hlc ] ) of order @xmath97 ) cancel .",

    "our next step will be to test this alternative regularization .",
    "one can consider two other possibilities for pv regularization  @xcite of full yukawa theory .",
