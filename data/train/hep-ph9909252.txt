    "the standard model ( sm ) represents the simplest and most economical theory which describes jointly weak and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "it describes well all terrestrial experimental results known today .",
    "nevertheless the sm can not be considered as the ultimative theory of nature and is likely to describe the effective interaction at low energy of an underlying more fundamental theory .",
    "the supersymmetry ( susy ) , which is one of the fundamental new symmetries of nature , is believed to be next step beyond the successful sm .",
    "the supersymmetry is the symmetry between fermions and bosons , which has to be broken in order to explain the phenomenology of the elementary particles and their superpartners .",
    "it is the only known symmetry which can stabilize the elementary higgs boson mass with respect to otherwise uncontrollable radiative corrections .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric model ( mssm ) , that leads to the sm at low energies has been the subject of extensive investigations .",
    "both the sm and the mssm leads to zero mass for the neutrinos . in view of the observed results on solar ( homestake @xcite ,",
    "kamiokande @xcite , gallex @xcite and sage @xcite ) and atmospheric neutrinos ( imb @xcite , soudan 2 @xcite , macro @xcite and super - kamiokande @xcite ) it is more appropriate to consider the extensions of the sm and the mssm that can lead to neutrino masses .",
    "neutrino masses either require the existence of right - handed neutrinos or require violation of the lepton number ( ln ) so that majorana masses are possible .",
    "so , one is forced to go beyond the minimal models again , whereby lf and/or ln violation can be allowed in the theory .",
    "a good candidate for such a theory is the left - right symmetric model of grand unification ( gut ) inaugurated by salam , pati , mohapatra and senjanovi @xcite ( especially models based on so(10 ) which have first been proposed by fritzsch and minkowski @xcite ) and its supersymmetric version @xcite .",
    "the left - right symmetric models , representing generalization of the @xmath2 sm , predict not only that the neutrino is a majorana particle , that means it is up to a phase identical with its antiparticle , but automatically predict the neutrino has a mass and a weak right - handed interaction .",
    "the basic idea behind grand unified models is an extension of the local gauge invariance from quantum chromodynamics ( su3 ) involving only the colored quarks also to electrons and neutrinos .",
    "we note that the non - supersymmetric left - right models suffer from the hierarchy problem .",
    "the expectations arising from gut s and theirs susy versions are that the conservation laws of the sm , e.g. ln conservation , may be violated to some small degree . in the left - right symmetric models",
    "the ln conservation is broken by the presence of the majorana neutrino mass .",
    "the ln violation is also inbuilt in those susy theories where r - parity , defined as @xmath3 ( s , b , and l are the spin , baryon and lepton number , respectively ) is not a conserved quantity anymore .",
    "the conservation of ln is among the most stringently tested laws of physics nowadays .",
    "the nuclei are well - suited as laboratory to test this fundamental symmetry due to the fact that a variety of quantum numbers is available as initial and final states .",
    "the neutrinoless double beta decay ( @xmath0-decay ) , @xmath4 which involves the emission of two electrons and no neutrinos , has been long recognized as a powerfool tool to study the ln conservation .",
    "the @xmath0-decay takes place only if the neutrino is a majorana particle with non - zero mass @xcite .",
    "the gut s and r - parity violating susy models offer a plethora of the @xmath0-decay mechanisms triggered by exchange of neutrinos , neutralinos , gluinos , leptoquarks etc .",
    "if one assumes that one mechanism at a time dominates , the half - life of the @xmath0-decay can be written as @xmath5 where lnv is some effective ln violating parameter , @xmath6 is the real part of the product of two nuclear matrix elements governing the @xmath0-decay and @xmath7 is the integrated kinematical factor .",
    "the sum over @xmath8 runs over different phase space integrals weighted by a corresponding product of nuclear matrix elements .",
    "there are different lnv parameters , e.g. the effective electron - neutrino mass , effective right handed weak interaction parameters , effective majoron coupling constant and r - parity violating susy parameters , which incorporate elements of the fundamental interaction of majorana neutrinos and/or r - parity violating interaction of susy particles ( see e.g. the recent review articles @xcite ) .",
    "the value of these parameters can be determined in two ways : i ) one can extract upper bound on the lnv parameter from the best presently available experimental lower limit on the half life of the @xmath0-decay @xmath9 after calculating the corresponding nuclear matrix elements .",
    "ii ) one can use the phenomenological constraints imposed by other experiments , e.g. those looking for the neutrino oscillation , to evaluate the lnv parameter explicitly , which further can be compared with the extracted one .",
    "the @xmath0-decay constraints on lnv parameters must be taken into account by the theoreticians , when they build new theories of grand unification .    at present",

    "the left - right symmetric models allow us to explain the smallness of the neutrino mass within the so called see - saw mechanism in the most natural way .",

    "the current experimental upper bounds on the @xmath0-decay effective ln violating parameters of interest for different isotopes are shown in table [ table.1 ] .",
    "we see that the heidelberg - moscow experiment @xcite ( in table [ table.1 ] we are giving the sensitivity of the experiment for @xmath10 being @xmath174 as we want to compare this value with those from other experiments . ) offers the most restrictive limit for @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 and the @xmath117 experiment @xcite for @xmath72 .",
    "we note that if the experimental data from an other geochemical experiment on double beta decay of @xmath117 would be considered ( @xmath175 , see refs . cited in @xcite ) , one would get less stringent limit on @xmath72 ( @xmath176 ) , which is comparable with the upper bound offered by the @xmath11 experiment @xcite ( see table [ table.1 ] ) .    at present the largest attention",
    "is paid to the effective electron majorana neutrino mass parameter @xmath54 in light of the positive signals in favor of oscillations of solar , atmospheric and terrestrial neutrinos .",
    "the masses and mixing angles can be determined from the available experimental data on neutrino oscillations and from astrophysical arguments by using some viable assumptions ( hierarchical and non - hierarchical neutrino spectra etc ) . at present",
    "the three and four neutrino mixing patterns are the most favorable ones @xcite . however , there is a discussion whether we really need the fourth sterile neutrino to fit the current experimental data .",
    "knowing the elements of the neutrino mixing matrix one can draw conclusions about the @xmath0-decay , in particular on @xmath54 , assuming neutrinos to be majorana particles . from the study of different neutrino mixing schemes it follows that the upper bound on effective majorana neutrino mass @xmath54 could be ranging from @xmath177 to 1 ev @xcite .",
    "from the table [ table.1 ] we see that the heidelberg - moscow @xmath0-decay experiment @xcite implies @xmath54 to be less 0.5 ev .",
