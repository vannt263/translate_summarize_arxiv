    "recently , it has been shown that in pp collisions the @xmath1 spectra of charged particles exhibit geometrical scaling @xcite . indeed , the @xmath1 spectra in pp collisions in the broad range of energies from 0.9 to 7 tev scale in a single variable @xmath7 , where the proton saturation momentum @xmath8 is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 .    in this paper , we study the extension of the geometrical scaling to aa collisions , considering rhic and lhc energies , different centralities and different nuclei .",
    "we show that the geometrical scaling is valid not only for each collision at fixed centrality separately but also for any centrality for @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , integrating the hard spectrum for @xmath6 we obtain that the hard multiplicity fraction decreases with the size of the participant nuclei as it would be expected from jet quenching .",
    "in order to check the geometrical scaling in aa collisions for any centrality we define the saturation momentum @xmath12 by @xmath13 where @xmath14    @xmath15 is the number of participant nucleons and @xmath16 is the number of nucleons .",
    "we observe that at high energy @xmath17 . with this value , for @xmath18",
    "we recover the commonly used behaviour of @xmath12 for central collisions @xmath19 .",
    "the parametrization of equation ( [ par ] ) is based on the the description of the experimental data on @xmath20 of pp and aa at all centralities , rapidities and energies using the framework of percolation of strings @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "the multiplicity distributions of any type of collisions depend on the string density , @xmath21 , which is a function of the string energy , @xmath22 , the number of participants , @xmath15 , and the number of nucleons of the nuclei , @xmath16 .",
    "this additional dependence on @xmath15 and @xmath16 is crucial to describe the differences observed among the multiplicity spectra of collisions across different nuclei but with the same number of participants .",
    "the function @xmath23 shown in formula ( [ alfa ] ) takes into account the energy conservation .",
    "this effect explains the different exponent of the power - like growing of the energy dependence of the pp and aa central multiplicities .",
    "usually , in strings or colour flux tube models , the number of strings formed in aa collisions is proportional to @xmath24 , being @xmath25 the number of collisions and @xmath26 the number of strings formed in a pp collision at the same energy .",
    "however , the formation of one string requires a minimum of energy , energy of around 0.5 - 0.6 gev . as the total available energy is @xmath27 , at low and intermediate energies ,",
    "there is not enough energy to be shared by such a large number of strings .",
    "we expect a suppression of the power 4/3 to @xmath28 , with @xmath29 at high energy .",
    "moreover , as the energy of each string is related to the longitudinal phase space that grows like @xmath30 , the approach to the asymptotic limit 1/3 should be logarithmic as the parametrization of formula ( [ alfa ] ) .",
    "in addition , the string percolation approach is related to the glasma of the colour glass condensate @xcite and there is a correspondence between the number of clusters of strings ( effective number of colour sources ) , @xmath31 , and the number of colour flux tubes of the glasma , @xmath32 . in this way",
    ", the dependence of the string density @xmath33 on @xmath22 , @xmath16 and @xmath34 is translated into @xmath35 , yielding in equation ( [ par ] ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath22 , @xmath16 and @xmath34 establishes the relative normalization of the transverse momentum distributions of different collisions ( the integrated distributions are proportional to @xmath32 ) .",
    "the values of the parameters @xmath36 and @xmath37 are taken from the reference @xcite .",
    "a slightly worse scaling has been obtained with @xmath38 .",
    "the value of @xmath39 was obtained in references @xcite and indicates the energy scale of the energy conservation effect .",
    "the different energy dependence of the saturation momentum for pp and aa collisions is also obtained in the cgc framework .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that the dglap and the bk evolution equations , with a detailed inclusion in the nuclear geometry , yield a different evolution speed @xcite able to describe the pp and aa multiplicity data .",
    "it has been also pointed out that in addition to the @xmath32 dependence , the multiplicity distribution has a factor describing the fragmentation of gluons into hadrons , @xmath40 . according to the @xmath41 data on jet production ,",
    "this fragmentation function is constant for @xmath42 but grows for @xmath43 . in pp and",
    "aa collisions we have @xmath44 and @xmath45 respectively , therefore in the case of aa collisions there is an additional energy dependence which originates a different increasing of pp and aa multiplicities @xcite .",
    "the equation [ par ] can be regarded as a parametrization of these effects .",
    "finally , in equation ( [ par ] ) , @xmath46 does not depend on rapidity ; we will nevertheless use it only in the central pseudorapidity region . in most of the string models , strings stretching among sea quarks and antiquarks are expanded only in the central pseudorapidity range . outside this pseudorapidity range",
    ", there are only strings involving valence quarks or valence diquarks . this fact changes the dependence of the number of strings on @xmath15 . for central pseudorapidity , @xmath47 and outside this range @xmath48 .",
    "this change gives rise to a smoother dependence of @xmath35 on @xmath15 outside the central pseudorapidity region .",
    "in fig . [ fig1 ] we show the data @xmath49 for cu - cu 0 - 6 % central at 62.4 and 200 gev and au - au 0 - 6 % central at 62.4 and 200 gev @xcite together with pb - pb 40 - 50 % , 5 - 10 % and 0 - 5 % at 2.76 tev @xcite as a function of @xmath4 , in the pseudorapidity range @xmath50 .",
    "the number of participants used is the mean value corresponding to the given centrality .",
    "experimental data taken from alice @xcite correspond to a pseudorapidity range ( including the @xmath51 region ) in which @xmath52 is smaller than in the pseudorapidity range considered here . because of this ,",
    "a 15 % correction was applied to the normalization @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that pb - pb 0 - 5 % and 5 - 10 % data points fall into the same line for @xmath5 .",
    "also the cu - cu and the au - au data points at both energies are approximately in the same curve for @xmath5 .",
    "only the pb - pb 40 - 50 % points present some departure around 1 .",
    "for @xmath6 it is shown a suppression for the heavy nuclei .    in order to see the differences between the different sizes of projectile and target , fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the data for pp collisions at 0.9 , 2.36 and 7 tev @xcite together with the recent p - pb data at 5.02 tev @xcite , the au - au 0 - 6 % central data at 62.4 gev @xcite and the pb - pb 0 - 5 % data at 2.76 tev @xcite in the pseudorapidity range @xmath50 . for the p - pb data we use @xmath53 as quoted in reference @xcite .",
    "we observe that the pp data at different energies fall into the same line , satisfying geometrical scaling , as it was shown in reference @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we observe that the p - pb , pb - pb 0 - 5 % and au - au 0 - 6 % central data at low @xmath4 are very close to the pp data of different energies .",
    "as @xmath4 becomes larger the difference between these sets of data increases . for @xmath6",
    "the suppression is larger for pb - pb 0 - 5 % central than for p - pb , which still is more suppressed than for pp data .",
    "the scaling for @xmath54 was predicted by cgc and by phenomenological saturation models @xcite .",
    "the hera data on deep inelastic scattering at low x show scaling even for very high @xmath55 , @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the solution of the bfkl evolution equation shows that the scaling can be extended to intermediate @xmath55 , @xmath57 @xcite . the comparison with data shows that pp data lie in the same curve at different energies even for @xmath58 . on the contrary",
    ", this is not true for aa collisions .",
    "notice that in the pp case we do not expect jet quenching because we do not have a high density medium , in opposition to aa collisions ( at high lhc energies and high multiplicity events , jet quenching has been predicted @xcite but the weight of these events compared to minimum bias is negligible ) .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , all previous data are plotted to show that for @xmath59 there are not many differences among them , which does not occur for the @xmath60 region , where suppression is larger for larger sizes of nuclei .",
    "we emphasize that the parametrization ( [ par ] ) allows us to deal with any type of collisions at any energy .",
    "for that purpose , the introduction of the @xmath23 function is required , which implies a different power for different number of participants . in reference",
    "@xcite the geometrical scaling was shown for pp collisions at lhc and aa collisions at rhic using an energy independent exponent @xmath61 , but this exponent was different for pp and aa collisions .",
    "if we use an energy independent exponent for both , pp and aa collisions , we spoil our scaling as it can be seen in in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] where we plot the pp and several aa transverse momentum distributions using @xmath62 .        in order to see the quality of this extended",
    "scaling we show in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] the ratio of pb - pb 0 - 5 % at 2.76 tev , au - au 0 - 6 % at 200 gev , cu - cu 0 - 6% at 62.4 gev , ppb at 5.02 tev over pp at 7 tev as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "even for such different projectiles and targets and also in the broad range of energies considered , we observe an approximate scaling at low @xmath4 .",
    "notice that for @xmath5 the data extend over three orders of magnitude .",
    "ratios vary between 0.5 and 1 in the range @xmath63 . notice that for @xmath64 , or equivalently for @xmath65 , there is no reason to expect geometrical scaling .",
    "the violation of the scaling is clear for @xmath6 , showing a higher suppression for heavier nuclei .",
    "the hierarchy of the scaling violations for @xmath6 agrees with the expected suppression due to jet quenching .",
    "based on this approximate scaling , we can compute the multiplicity of soft and hard particles per participant , defining soft particles as those with @xmath3 and hard particles as those with @xmath66 .",
    "in fact , @xmath67 and with the change of variables @xmath68 the fraction of soft and hard multiplicities over the total multiplicity results @xmath69    in table [ tab1 ] we present the results for the fractions of soft and hard multiplicities for the centralities , energies and collisions considered .",
    "in order to do the integration in ( [ 6 ] ) , we perform a fit to each @xmath70-distribution separately which is afterwards integrated .",
    "we observe that the hard fraction decreases slowly with energy and also decreases with the size of the participant nuclei . in the case of pp collisions",
    "the dependence of the energy is very weak , varying from 9 % to 8 % in the broad range 0.9 - 7 tev .",
    "however , we observe larger differences between au - au 0 - 6 % central at 62.4 gev , whose hard fraction is 7 % , and pb - pb 0 - 5 % at 2.76 tev , which is 2 % . for pb - pb at 2.76",
    "tev the hard fraction is the same for peripheral ( 40 - 50 % ) than for central ( 0 - 5 % ) .",
    ".[tab1]values of the fractions of soft and hard multiplicities for different nuclei , centralities and energies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "usually it is believed that as the energy or the size of the participant nuclei increases , the weight of the hard collisions increases and , correspondingly , the weight of the hard multiplicity . we observe the opposite with our definition of hard and soft collisions .",
    "this result was also pointed out by the alice collaboration data of the sphericity as a function of the energy and the change multiplicity in pp collisions at @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 tev @xcite .",
    "the sphericity measures the jet activity , in such a way that one event with dijet back to back implies sphericity zero . on the contrary ,",
    "an event where all the produced particles are distributed isotropically in phase space implies sphericity one .",
    "most of the monte - carlo codes ( pythia 8 , perugia-0 , phojet , atlas - csc ) predict a decreasing of the sphericity with energy and charged multiplicity whereas the data show the opposite trend . in the color glass condensate model",
    "@xcite the more the saturation momentum grows with the energy and the number of participants , the smaller the room for hard collisions .",
    "this also happens in the framework of percolation strings @xcite where the area covered by strings increases with the size and energy of the nuclei leaving less room for hard scatterings .",
    "let us mention that the scaling found is naturally incorporated in the colour glass condensate @xcite where the @xmath70 spectrum depends only on @xmath74 . in the model of percolation of strings",
    "@xcite a scaling law for the @xmath70 dependence is also obtained .",
    "now the role of @xmath75 is played by @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the string density @xcite .",
    "indeed the parametrization ( [ par ] ) has its origin in the parametrization of @xmath76 @xcite .    in conclusion",
    ", we have shown that the geometrical scaling previously seen in pp collisions can be extended to aa collisions , being satisfied also for different centralities . for different projectiles and targets",
    "an approximate scaling is also satisfied although in this case some differences occur .",
    "the departure of scaling for @xmath6 follows the expected hierarchy in jet quenching , namely the suppression is larger for larger participant nuclei .",
