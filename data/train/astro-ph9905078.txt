    "amongst the many kinds of sources in the variable x - ray sky , x - ray transients have been observed since the first experiments in the late 60 s . according to their duration ,",
    "it is possible to distinguish between long - duration x - ray transients ( lasting from weeks to few months ) and short - duration x - ray transients ( lasting from hours to very few days ) .",
    "long - duration x - ray transients are mainly related to be - neutron star systems ( be x - ray transients ) and to soft x - ray transients ( a subclass of low - mass x - ray binaries ) .",
    "the latter include the best black hole candidates found so far ( tanaka & shibazaki 1996 ) .",
    "but not too much is known with respect to most of short - duration x - ray transients .",
    "the main reason is the lack of counterparts at other wavelengths .",
    "one subclass are the so - called fast x - ray transients , that have been observed with many detectors since the launching of the _ vela _ satellites ( heise et al .",
    "1975 , cooke 1976 ) until the advent of the _ bepposax _ satellite ( heise et al . 1998 ) .",
    "durations range from seconds ( belian , conner & evans 1976 ) to less than few hours .",
    "normally , they have been seen once , and never seen in quiescence , implying high peak - to - quiescent flux ratios ( 10@xmath5 - 10@xmath6 ) ( ambruster et al .",
    "spectral characteristics vary substantially , from a hard spectrum in mx 2346 - 65 ( kt @xmath0 20 kev ; rappaport et al . 1976 )",

    ", it seems that these events are caused by more than one physical mechanism . in several cases ,",
    "there have been tentative optical identifications on the basis of known sources in the transient error boxes .",
    "one suggestion has been that many of the fast x - ray transients are related with stellar flares originated in active coronal sources , like rs cvn binaries or dme - dke flare stars .",
    "rs cvn systems are binaries formed by a cool giant / subgiant ( like a k0 iv ) with an active corona and a less massive companion ( a late g - dwarf ) in a close synchronous orbit , with typical periods of 1 - 14 d. peak luminosities are usually l@xmath1 @xmath0 10@xmath11 erg s@xmath4 .",

    "<S> during 1990 - 92 , the watch all - sky x - ray monitor on _ granat _ discovered six short - duration x - ray transients . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we discuss their possible relationship to peculiar stars . </S>",
    "<S> only one of the fast ( few hours ) x - ray transients ( grs 1100 - 771 ) might be tentatively ascribed to a superflare arising from a young stellar object in the chamaeleon i star - forming cloud . at the distance of @xmath0 150 pc , l@xmath1 = 1.35 @xmath2 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 ( 8 - 15 kev ) , or 2.6 @xmath2 10@xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 ( 0.1 - 2.4 kev ) assuming a thermal spectrum with kt @xmath0 10 kev , a temperature higher than those previously seen in t tauri stars ( tsuboi et al . 1998 ) . </S>",

    "<S> peak _ </S>",
    "<S> x  ray luminosity is at least 2 times higher than that derived for the protostar irs 43 ( grosso et al . 1997 ) which would make -to our knowledge- the strongest flare ever seen in a yso . </S>",
    "<S> however , the possibility of grs 1100 - 771 being an isolated neutron star unrelated to the cloud can not be excluded , given the relatively large error box provided by watch . regarding the longer duration ( @xmath0 1 day ) </S>",
    "<S> x - ray transients , none of them seem to be related to known objects . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the latter are likely to have originated from compact objects in low - mass or high - mass x - ray binaries , similarly to xte j0421 + 560 . </S>"
