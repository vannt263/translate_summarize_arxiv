    "we would like to have an accurate and objective way to find the continuum level in qso spectra , because these levels are required to measure the amount of absorption .",
    "the uncertainty in the continuum level is often one of the largest uncertainties in the studies of intergalactic medium ( igm , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the precise continuum shape is required for precision measurement of absorption lines , such as the measurement of d / h @xcite .",
    "standard methods of estimating the continua in the  forest  region of qso spectra are frequently unsatisfactory . for redshifts @xmath1 , the standard way to find",
    "a continuum level is to fit a smooth curve over the peaks of the flux in the  forest .",
    "this method works well , giving @xmath2% errors in the continuum level in high resolution spectra ( e.g. 8  fwhm ) with high s / n ( e.g. 100 per 2 , * ? ? ?",
    ". however , the method fails when there are few pixels that we can clearly identify as unabsorbed continuum , and this lack of continuum information is common in low s / n spectra , in low resolution spectra where lines blend together , and at higher redshifts where the  forest  absorbs more than a few percent at all wavelengths .",
    "in fact , by redshifts @xmath3 the complete gunn - peterson trough @xcite makes it impossible to directly measure the continuum . instead , at high redshifts , especially @xmath4 , it is common to approximate the continuum in the  forest  with a power - law extrapolation from wavelengths larger than   @xcite .",
    "but the continuum in the  forest  is not a power law , because the wings of the ly-@xmath5-o  vi emission line and especially the  line , extend far into the  forest  and there exist weak emission lines especially near 1073 and 1123  @xcite",
    ". we might be able to predict the unabsorbed flux in the  forest  if it is correlated with the unabsorbed flux at other wavelengths . here",
    ", the unabsorbed flux includes both continuum and emission lines , but not the random intervening absorption .",
    "we measure correlations in a set of qso spectra ( hereafter the training set ) , that cover both 1020   @xmath6 1215   ( hereafter the blue side ) and 1216   @xmath6 1600   ( hereafter the red side ) . we will use the red side spectra of individual qsos to make predictions of their blue sides .",
    "we use principal component analysis ( pca ) to summarize the information in the qso spectra .",
    "pca seeks to reduce the dimensionality of large data sets and is widely used in astronomy . @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied pca to the lbqs @xcite optical spectra of qsos to give an objective classification scheme , and they showed that any normalized qso spectrum , @xmath7 , is well represented by a reconstructed spectrum , @xmath8 , that is a weighted sum of _ m _ principal components , @xmath9 where _ i _ refers to a qso , @xmath10 is the mean of many qso spectra , @xmath11 is the _",
    "j _ th principal component , and @xmath12 is its weight . instead of classifying qso spectra , we use pca to make predictions .    in  2",
    "we describe hst spectra that we use for the training set .",
    "we show the correlations in the qso spectra and results of the pca in  3 . in ",
    "4 we show how we make predictions and we discuss their accuracy .",
    "for the training set we use uv spectra of low redshift ( @xmath13 ) qsos because they have little absorption and we can clearly see their continua levels . here",
    "we describe these spectra , the criteria that we use to select them , and the corrections that we make .",
    "we use a subset of the 334 high resolution _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) _ faint object spectrograph _ ( fos ) spectra collected and calibrated by @xcite .",
    "this sample includes all of the high resolution qso spectra from the hst qso absorption line key project @xcite .",
    "the gratings chosen are g130h , g190h , and g270h , and their spectral resolution is r @xmath14 1300 .",
    "@xcite identified both igm and ism lines in a uniform manner and they applied galactic extinction corrections using the galactic reddening map of @xcite and the milky way reddening curve of @xcite .",
    "we select qso spectra by wavelength coverage and s / n , and we remove a few qsos with peculiar spectra . we reject qsos that do not have complete coverage from 1020   to 1600  .",
    "this range covers from the  + o  vi emission line blend to the c  iv emission line .",
    "a larger range would help reveal the shapes of the qso continua , but we would then have fewer qsos in the sample .",
    "we reject qsos that did not have an average s / n @xmath15 per binned pixel ( 0.5   in the rest frame ) from 1050   to 1170  .",
    "we are interested in the intrinsic variation of the qso spectra against the mean spectrum .",
    "photon noise adds variation , masks the intrinsic variations , and alters the primary principal components . before we removed the low s",
    "/ n spectra , we found that some principal components were largely reproducing the photon noise of the spectra with unusually low s / n .",
    "we remove qsos with broad absorption lines and damped system because we are unsure where to place their continua .",
    "we also remove q0219 + 4248 and q0906 + 4305 whose emission line features are extremely weak .",
    "these removals make our sample not representative of all qso spectra .",
    "we end up using the spectra of 50 qsos that we list in table 1 .",
    "the mean redshift is 0.58 , with a standard deviation of 0.27 and a range from 0.14 to 1.04 .",
    "the average s / n is 19.5 .",
    "we will represent the spectra of all 50 qso by fitted smooth curves that reduce the effects of photon noise and interpolate over the absorption lines . to find the smooth curves , we mask the absorption lines which @xcite identified in both the blue and red sides .",
    "then , for every 50   interval , with 20   overlaps , we fit chebyshev polynomials and we choose the order of the polynomials so that the reduced @xmath16 becomes close to unity .",
    "the order is about 4 @xmath14 6 if no strong emission line lies in that interval . in intervals which include strong emission lines such as  and c  iv ,",
    "the order becomes 30 @xmath14 40 .",
    "for a few qsos we made further adjustments by hand .    in table 1",
    "we give emission redshifts that we measure from the peaks of the  emission lines . in the rest frame",
    "the emission line peaks align , and the asymmetric profiles become a part of variance in the set of spectra . if we do not use the peak of the  line , but instead we cross - correlate with a template of known redshift , we find that we need extra principal components to reconstruct the emission lines .",
    "once we obtain the redshifts , we shift the spectra to the rest frame , and we rebin them into 0.5   pixels .",
    "we then have 1161 pixels of flux data values per qso in the range 1020    1600  .",
    "since we are interested in the relative spectrum shape , we throw away absolute flux information .",
    "we find the average flux in 21 pixels around 1280   , and we normalize all spectra to unit flux at these wavelengths , far from any strong emission lines .",
    "we calculate the correlation of the fluxes at different wavelengths to see how different parts of the typical qso spectrum are related . in figure 1 , we see the @xmath17 correlation matrix @xmath18 with elements @xmath19 where @xmath7 is the continuum fitted and normalized spectrum for the _ i _ th qso , @xmath20 is the total number of qso spectra , @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the standard deviations of the flux in the _ m_th and _ n_th wavelength bins , @xmath23 and @xmath24 respectively .",
    "we find moderate correlation , about 0.2 @xmath14 0.6 , between the red and blue continua .",
    "the correlation between the emission lines , 0.8 , is much stronger , and hence we expect that the emission lines in the red side will give good predictions for those in the blue side",
    ".    we can calculate the covariance matrix @xmath25 for the 50 qsos as : @xmath26 in figure 2 we see the covariance is relatively small in the continuum but large in the emission lines , meaning that the emission lines vary a lot from qso to qso .",
    "the peaks near 1073 and 1123    probably correspond to the weak emission lines in the  forest   that @xcite discuss .",
    "we can find the principal components by decomposing the covariance matrix @xmath25 into the product of the orthonormal matrix @xmath27 which is composed of eigenvectors , and the diagonal matrix @xmath28 containing the eigenvalues : @xmath29 we call the eigenvectors , the columns of the matrix @xmath27 , the principal components .",
    "the principal components are ordered according to the amount of the variance in the training set that they can accommodate , such that the first principal component is the eigenvector which has the largest eigenvalue .",
    "let us quantitatively assess how well we can reconstruct the qso spectra using a certain number of the components .",
    "we find the weight @xmath12 of the _ j_th principal component for qso spectrum @xmath7 from : @xmath30 when we use the first @xmath31 components , we get the reconstructed spectrum @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath11 look similar to qso spectra , but with more structure at the wavelengths of the emission lines .",
    "examples of principal components and reconstructions , which are very similar to ours , are given by @xcite .",
    "we now introduce the accumulated residual variance fraction @xmath33 : @xmath34 this quantity measures the square of the difference of a reconstructed spectrum from the continuum fitted qso spectrum , in units of the square of the difference between that qso and the mean .",
    "hence @xmath33 decreases from 1 to near zero as we add components to the reconstruction .",
    "the @xmath31 in @xmath33 tells us that we have used the first @xmath31 components in the reconstruction @xmath8 . in table 2 , we list the mean @xmath35 , averaged over all 50 qsos .",
    "the first three component takes 77% of the residual , and the first 10 components absorb about 96% .",
    "* their fig .",
    "4 ) analyzed the lbqs set of qso spectra @xcite . using a different statistic that accounts for photon noise , different wavelengths , and including bal qsos and all absorption lines",
    ", they found that the first three components accounted for 75% of the variance , and the first 10 components 95% .",
    "we also analyzed the lbqs spectra , kindly provided by paul francis and paul hewett , to confirm that our implementation of the pca matched theirs given our wavelength range and selection criteria .",
    "the residual variance decreases in a different way for each qso because the contributions of the components differ .",
    "however , on average , the rate of reduction slows after third component and saturates around the 10th component .",
    "the components greater than about 10th look noisy and carry little information . in the following discussion , we use up to the first 10 principal components .",
    "our goal is to predict the continuum of a qso in the  forest , the blue side , using a spectrum of wavelengths larger than  emission , the red side . in ",
    "4.1 we describe how we relate the blue and red side continua , and in  4.2 we give a general recipe to make predictions .",
    "unfortunately , we do not have enough qso spectra for both a training set and a separate set of spectra that we can use to test our predictions .",
    "hence , we also use the training set for the tests .",
    "when we make a prediction for a qso , we use a set of principal components which we generated without using any spectra of that qso .",
    "we will call this the bootstrap method , and we will use it in most of the remainder of this paper . when we omit different qsos ,",
    "the first five principal components change by a few percent , most noticeably at the wavelengths of the emission lines . if we do not omit the qso of interest , the complete set of principal components contains all the information on each qso , including the continuum fitting and photon noise .",
    "we found the noise features could identify a qso , giving weights with unrealistically high precision .",
    "* step 1 : find the first @xmath31 principal components @xmath36 and their weights , @xmath12 .",
    "we use all the blue and red side wavelengths , 1020   to 1600  , and we use the bootstrap method to give a slightly different set of @xmath36 for each qso @xmath37 . * step 2 : repeat step one , using only the red wavelengths 1216   to 1600  .",
    "we again keep the first @xmath31 principal components , @xmath38 and their weights , @xmath39 , which are similar to those from step one . *",
    "step 3 : solve linear equations to find a projection matrix which relates @xmath12 and @xmath39 .",
    "we can write the weights in the @xmath40 matrix form @xmath41 @xmath42 and similarly for @xmath43 . we would like to find the @xmath44 projection matrix @xmath45 @xmath46 which translates weights found on the red side to the weights for the whole spectrum :      we have @xmath48 qsos , and we keep @xmath49 components .",
    "we then have more equations ( n ) than unknowns ( m ) and we wish to find the least - squares solution to this over - determined set of linear equations .",
    "the solution matrix @xmath45 can be found via the singular value decomposition technique @xcite .",
    "we are now ready to make a prediction of the  forest  continuum of any qso spectrum , that need not be in the training set , provided we have the red side of its spectrum .",
    "we obtain predictions in three steps , that are similar to those presented above to find @xmath45 .",
    "* step a : find the weights for the red spectrum , @xmath50 the @xmath51 will be like the @xmath39 in step 2 above , except that the principal components could be different .",
    "if the qso is not part of the training set , then the @xmath38 can be derived using the entire training set .",
    "* step b : translate the weights from the red side @xmath51 , to weights for whole spectrum , using @xmath52 this resembles equation ( 7 ) , except that we now know @xmath45 and we are deriving the @xmath53 that play the roles of the @xmath12 of step 1 .",
    "* step c : make a predicted spectrum , @xmath54    the predicted spectrum @xmath55 differs from the reconstruction @xmath8 because the reconstruction uses weights derived from the blue and red sides of the spectrum , using equation ( 1 ) , where as the predictions use weights derived from the red part of the spectrum alone , using equations ( 8) and ( 9 ) .        in figure 3 , we show two relatively successful and two unsuccessful predictions , @xmath56 , together with the corresponding continuum fitted qso spectra , @xmath57 . when the prediction fails , the predicted spectrum is systematically either too low or too high , but with no preference .",
    "we assess the errors on our predictions using the absolute fractional flux error : @xmath58 for the blue side , @xmath59    and @xmath60  , avoiding the  and  emission lines , and for the red side , @xmath61   and @xmath62  . in table 1 , we list the absolute fractional flux errors for each qso , when we use @xmath49 components . in table 2 , row ( c ) and ( e ) , we list @xmath63 , the mean of the absolute fractional flux error from all 50 qsos , and we show how this mean changes with @xmath31 . for comparison , in rows ( b ) and",
    "( d ) , we also list @xmath64 obtained by reconstruction when we replace @xmath55 in equation ( 11 ) by @xmath8 from equation ( 1 ) .",
    "these @xmath8 use principal components derived from the blue plus red sides .",
    "we find similar values if we use principal components from the red side alone .",
    "the advantage of using more components is different for the reconstruction , the red side prediction , and the blue side prediction . for the reconstruction and the red side prediction ,",
    "more components always improve the fit ( table 2 , row ( b ) , ( c ) , ( d ) ) , although the reduction of the error is small after about the 10th component , and we think the remaining 3% absolute fractional flux error is similar in size to the error of the continuum fitting (  2 ) .    on the other hand , for the blue side prediction , adding more components does not reduce the mean error .",
    "we think the reason is related to the properties of the first few principal components .",
    "only the third , fourth and fifth principal components have a significant slope . if we choose appropriate weights for these components , we are likely to make accurate predictions , and adding more components can reduce the residuals ( figure 3 , panel ( a ) , ( b ) ) .",
    "but if we choose inappropriate weights , there is no way to correct the slope ( figure 3 , panel ( c ) , ( d ) ) .",
    "hence the main error in our predictions is a systematic slope error which makes the blue side prediction too high or too low .",
    "although our predictions give small errors for some qsos , they give huge errors for others . with 10 components ,",
    "the mode of the @xmath65 distribution is 3% , the median is 8% , and the range is about 30% .",
    "we predict the blue continua of 28 qsos out of 50 qsos to @xmath66 , but we do not know which qsos will have these small errors .",
    "we find that many of the qsos that give the largest errors have absorption or unusually low s / n on the red side of the  line ( 1216  1240   , noted in table 1 ) which makes the continuum level hard to estimate .",
    "this region is significant because it contains much of the variance and hence will have a large effect on the weights .",
    "however in others cases there is little or no absorption , and the slope of the spectrum appears to change as we cross the  emission line .",
    "we do not in general see any correlation between the errors in the red and blue side predictions .",
    "we introduce a third error statistic , the fractional flux error , @xmath67 to help us estimate the error in the integrated flux .",
    "this error is related to flux decrement statistic , @xmath68 @xcite , which has been used to calibrate numerical simulations of the igm @xcite . in table 1",
    "we see that @xmath69 has a similar magnitude to @xmath70 , also for the blue side , because the predictions tend to be too low or too high across the entire blue side .",
    "the mean of @xmath71 for all 50 qsos , @xmath72 , is zero by definition , at each wavelength , when we use @xmath73 , because @xmath74 . when @xmath75 , the statistic @xmath72 represents the bias in the predictions , and in table 2 we see that it remains within a few percent of zero for all @xmath76 .    in figure 4",
    "we show an example of the prediction of the  forest  continuum of a higher redshift qso from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite for which the continuum is unobservable because of the large amount of absorption . to make this prediction , which looks acceptable",
    ", we use the red side of its spectrum .",
    "the intrinsic slope of the continuum may be changing at the uv wavelengths we consider @xcite .",
    "the uv flux from qsos is black body radiation from the accretion disk around the central super massive black hole @xcite .",
    "if we pass over the peak of the black body continuum , the slope changes rapidly , and we will not have enough wavelength coverage to follow the change of the slope .",
    "there are many possible errors in the calibration of the spectra , especially the galactic extinction correction @xcite . at our wavelengths ,",
    "the extinction increases rapidly as the wavelength drops .",
    "if we underestimate color excess e(_b - v _ ) for a @xmath77 qso by 0.01 magnitudes , we decrease the flux at 1600   by 7% , and at 1020   by 14% .",
    "we have presented only one of many ways of predicting spectra .",
    "we attempted some other less successful schemes before we arrived at this method .",
    "for instance , we fitted the red side by minimizing the @xmath16 of @xmath36 against @xmath7 to get @xmath53 , but we found the blue side prediction is then unstable .",
    "different combinations of the principal components give similar @xmath16 on the red side , but their blue sides can have a large variety .",
    "we also experimented with different ways of normalizing the spectra , both near 1450    and using the entire red side , and we obtain similar results .",
    "we tried attempting to remove the slopes from spectra , by fitting a straight line to the red sides , but these lines were not adequately determined .    the predictions given here could be improved in several ways .",
    "we should first seek improved methods , which might not involve pca .",
    "if we had spectra of many more qsos we would be less subject to the distortions and noise in individual spectra , and we could test the predictions on spectra that were not in the training set .",
    "higher resolution and higher s / n spectra would help to reveal the weak emission features , and reduce the errors in the initial continuum fit . extending the wavelength range on",
    "the red side may help identify the slope of the continuum for some qsos , but for others we found that a reduced wavelength range , from 1216  1400    gave better predictions , because this restricted range has a stronger correlation with the flux on the blue side .",
    "we have also made predictions with the red side restricted to 1280  1600   , to avoid the large flux errors that can occur when there are absorption lines in the  and n  v emission lines .",
    "we found that there was no significant change in @xmath64 .",
