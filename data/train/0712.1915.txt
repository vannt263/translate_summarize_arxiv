    "it consists at least 0.2 mhz ( see the discussion after eq.(59 ) ) we neglect also the electron vertex contributions of order @xmath200 mhz which appear in higher orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "thereby , the total theoretical uncertainty is not exceeded @xmath201 mhz .",
    "the existing difference between the obtained theoretical result and experimental value of the hyperfine splitting ( 1 ) equal to 0.522 mhz lies in the range of total error .",
    "theoretical error which remains sufficiently large in the comparison with the experimental uncertainty , initiates further theoretical investigation of the higher order contributions including more careful construction of the three - particle interaction operator connected with the multiphoton exchanges .",
