    "in a previous article ( cargo 2004 ) , hereinafter referred to as i , we have developed a normal form transformation for a one - dimensional quantum hamiltonian whose weyl symbol has a generic , stable fixed point in phase space . in particular , we showed that such a hamiltonian can be transformed via unitary conjugation into a function of the harmonic oscillator in a neighborhood of the fixed point , in the sense of formal power series in @xmath0 .",
    "one of the consequences is the bohr - sommerfeld rule for the eigenvalues of the hamiltonian , extended to higher order in @xmath0 . in this article",
    "we generalize this normal form transformation to multidimensional , integrable systems , in which a complete set of commuting observables , one of which has a generic , stable fixed point in phase space , is transformed via unitary conjugation into a set of functions of the harmonic oscillators in the various degrees of freedom .",
    "one consequence is the einstein - brillouin - keller ( ebk ) or torus quantization rule , including higher order corrections in @xmath0 .",
    "part of this calculation is a straightforward generalization of the methods of i , and part involves nontrivial new techniques . in the following a familiarity with i",
    "is assumed .",
    "references to equations , sections and appendices of i are preceded by `` i '' ( for example , equation  ( ) , section  , or ) .    in our opinion",
    "the normal form transformation itself , which has many variations not yet explored ( unstable fixed points , regions including separatrices , nongeneric fixed points , etc . ) , and the diagrammatic and other techniques developed for carrying out the normal form transformation , are the most important results of i and of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , the torus quantization rule and its higher order corrections are the results that are most easily appreciated and understood , so we have given them particular prominence in the following discussion .",
    "the usual torus quantization rule ( einstein , 1917 ; brillouin , 1926 ; keller , 1958 ; percival , 1973 ; berry and tabor , 1976 ) is valid only for integrable systems , which at the level of the usual formula means that the classical hamiltonian is integrable in a classical sense . if @xmath1 is a classical , integrable hamiltonian of @xmath2 degrees of freedom with actions @xmath3 and angles @xmath4 , then the torus quantization rule states that the eigenvalues of the corresponding quantum hamiltonian @xmath5 are given approximately by @xmath6 , where @xmath1 is expressed as a function of the actions , where the actions are evaluated at @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a vector of integer quantum numbers , and where @xmath9 is the vector of maslov indices ( maslov and fedoriuk 1981 , littlejohn and robbins 1987 , eckhardt and wintgen 1991 , de gosson 1997 , foxman and robbins 2004 ) .",
    "see [ notation ] for notation .",
    "the torus quantization rule is discussed more fully and precisely in the explanation of ( [ theresult ] ) below .",
    "examples of integrable systems include central force motion in any number of dimensions in ordinary particle mechanics , objects such as the @xmath10-symbols in angular momentum theory ( which are the eigenfunctions of complete sets of commuting observables ) , and integrable lattice and soliton systems .",
    "integrable systems have also exerted a powerful influence on various areas of mathematics and mathematical physics , including symplectic geometry and representation theory ( weinstein 1977 , marsden and ratiu 1999 , kirillov 1976 ) .",
    "they are also the reference point for understanding partially integrable or nonintegrable systems .",
    "a normal form transformation of the kind developed in i has been studied by helffer and robert ( 1984 ) in the one - dimensional case .",
    "these authors use fourier integral operators to carry out the normal form ( rather than the moyal star product , as in our work ) , and they prove the existence of the asymptotic @xmath0 series for the eigenvalues . they do not , however , explicitly compute the higher order terms . in",
    "related work , charbonnel ( 1986 ) has studied a multidimensional example .",
    "one question that arises immediately when contemplating higher order corrections to the torus quantization rule is what shall be the definition of an integrable system in quantum mechanics .",
    "a set of @xmath2 operators need only commute through order @xmath0 for their principal symbols to poisson commute , and thereby to define a classically integrable system .",
    "the latter is all that is required for the usual ( lowest order ) torus quantization formula to be meaningful . when we extend torus quantization to higher order in @xmath0 , is poisson commutativity of the principal symbols sufficient , or must the operators commute to higher order in @xmath0 ?",
    "one might suppose that terms that are higher order in @xmath0 could be handled by some kind of perturbation theory , and that classical integrability would suffice .",
    "in fact , it turns out that for torus quantization to be meaningful to all orders in @xmath0 it is necessary to have a complete set of operators that commute to all orders in @xmath0 . without this condition , the normal form transformation that is the basis of our analysis does not exist , at least in the form of the power series in @xmath0 that we posit for it . if this and other , reasonable ( generic ) conditions to be described below hold , then as we shall show the torus quantization rule can be extended to arbitrary order in @xmath0 .",
    "we now present the generalized torus quantization rule , deferring the details of our assumptions to the main body of the paper .",
    "let @xmath11 be a set of @xmath2 commuting , hermitian operators , @xmath12=0 $ ] , @xmath13 , of which @xmath14 is `` the '' hamiltonian ( above referred to as simply @xmath15 ) .",
    "let the ( weyl ) symbols of these operators be @xmath16 ( that is , without the hat .",
    "see [ notation ] . ) these are assumed to have an @xmath0-expansion of the form , @xmath17 that is , they are `` slowly varying '' or `` admissible '' ( voros 1977 ) with only even powers of @xmath0 .",
    "the leading terms @xmath18 are the `` principal symbols '' of the operators @xmath19 .",
    "we assume that odd powers of @xmath0 are absent from this expansion because their inclusion serves only to complicate all the formulas of this analysis without introducing any fundamentally new issues .",
    "in addition , most of the examples we can think of ( such as @xmath20 in a 3-dimensional central force problem ) have symbols that are even series in @xmath0 , a property that evidently is related to the hermiticity of the operators @xmath19 . the principal symbols @xmath18 poisson commute , @xmath21 , since all correction terms in the moyal series ( ) for the symbol of a commutator are of higher order in @xmath0 .    the principal symbol @xmath22 of the quantum hamiltonian @xmath14 will be treated as the classical hamiltonian ( above referred to simply as @xmath1 ) .",
    "we assume that it possesses a generic extremum at some ( fixed ) point of phase space , so that classical motion in a neighborhood of this point is bounded and the fixed point is stable .",
    "action - angle variables @xmath23 are defined in this neighborhood , and the principal symbols can be expressed as functions of the actions , @xmath24 .",
    "then the eigenvalues @xmath25 of @xmath19 are given by @xmath26 &       a^k \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ]      & d_\\mu ) }       + \\frac{1}{16 } \\omega_{jkl }      \\xymatrix@c=1pc{(a^k \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ]       \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] & a^l ) }      \\nonumber \\\\      & -\\frac{1}{24 } \\omega_{jklm }       \\xymatrix@c=1pc{(a^k \\ar[r ] & a^l \\ar[r ] & a^m ) }      \\biggr>_\\phi       + o(\\hbar^4 ) \\biggr ]       \\biggr|_{a=(n+\\gamma/4)\\hbar } ,      \\label{theresult }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are @xmath2-vectors of integer quantum numbers and maslov indices , as above .",
    "the ranges of the integers @xmath29 depend on the contours on the tori used to defined the actions @xmath30 , in a manner that will be made precise in subsection  [ secondstage ] .",
    "equation  ( [ theresult ] ) is the torus quantization rule , carried through order @xmath31 .",
    "equation  ( [ theresult ] ) uses the following notation .",
    "( see also [ notation ] . )",
    "repeated indices are summed .",
    "the frequency matrix of the principal symbols and its action derivatives are denoted by @xmath32 these are all functions of the actions @xmath33 .",
    "the angle bracket @xmath34 at order @xmath31 in ( [ theresult ] ) indicates an average over the angles @xmath35 ( a torus average ) .",
    "the quantities inside the angle bracket depend on both @xmath33 and @xmath35 , but of course only on @xmath33 after the averaging .",
    "the diagrammatic notation is explained in , with obvious generalizations to the multidimensional case .",
    "the notation @xmath36 stands for the action - angle variables collectively , specifically , @xmath37 ( see [ notation ] ) .",
    "finally , the entire expression is evaluated at the quantized values of the actions , @xmath38 .",
    "equation  ( [ theresult ] ) may be compared to its one - dimensional counterpart ( ) .",
    "the one - dimensional quantization rule at order @xmath31 is expressed in terms of a single diagram , the second moyal bracket @xmath39 \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] & h}$ ] of @xmath1 with itself .",
    "if @xmath1 is expressed as a function of @xmath33 ( the action of the one - dimensional problem ) , this one diagram can be expanded by the chain rule yielding several diagrams , as in the multidimensional formula ( [ theresult ] ) .",
    "equation  ( [ theresult ] ) , on the other hand , can not in general be condensed into diagrams involving the symbols @xmath40 alone , but rather must be expressed in terms of diagrams involving the actions @xmath30 , and , in the case of the first diagram , also the angles @xmath41 .",
    "it does reduce to ( ) in the one - dimensional case , but it is not a simple or obvious generalization of the one - dimensional formula . equation  ( [ theresult ] ) will be discussed more fully in sec",
    ".  [ discussion ] , but for now we simply remark that of the three diagrams shown , the final two are in a sense `` trivial '' consequences of the formula for the symbol of a function of an operator , while the first one is the difficult one that requires new techniques for its evaluation .",
    "the normal form transformation of this paper takes place on three levels , of which the first two are purely classical .",
    "normal forms of classical hamiltonian systems have received considerable attention in recent years ( for example , eliasson 1990 , fomenko 1991 ) .",
    "the first level takes place in a small neighborhood of the fixed point of the classical hamiltonian @xmath22 , in which the functions @xmath18 are represented by their quadratic approximations about the fixed point and a linear canonical transformation is used to achieve a classical normal form .",
    "( specifically , it transforms these quadratic approximations into linear combinations of harmonic oscillators . ) at the next level , this linear canonical transformation in a small neighborhood of the fixed point is extended to a nonlinear canonical transformation in a certain `` region of interest , '' in which the level sets of the functions @xmath18 are tori , achieving a nonlinear classical normal form in that region .",
    "( specifically , the @xmath18 are transformed into nonlinear functions of the harmonic oscillators ) . at the third level",
    ", the nonlinear classical normal form transformation is used as the skeleton for the construction of a quantum normal form transformation , valid in the sense of formal power series in @xmath0 , constructed out of the moyal star product .",
    "( specifically , the symbols of the operators @xmath19 become functions of the symbols of the quantum harmonic oscillators in the region of interest ) .",
    "the quantum normal form then allows an easy derivation of the torus quantization rule .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ thecalculation ] contains an overview of the calculation , allowing readers who are familiar with i to understand the main ideas and how they differ from i. section  [ details ] contains a more detailed discussion of various steps in the presentation , including the rich subject of the classical normal form .",
    "section  [ discussion ] contains a discussion of various aspects of the result ( [ theresult ] ) , especially certain issues of differential geometry raised by the result .",
    "section  [ conclusions ] contains conclusions .",
    "finally , a series of appendices contain much of the real work of the calculation , as well as a detailed presentation of an example .",
    "in this section we present an overview of the calculation , assuming a familiarity with i , and we point out various similarities and differences with i.    one difference concerns the notation for weyl symbols and their expansions in powers of @xmath0 . in i",
    ", the classical hamiltonian was taken to be the symbol @xmath1 of the quantum hamiltonian @xmath5 , that is , the whole symbol , possibly with an @xmath0 dependence , whereas in this paper the classical hamiltonian is taken to be the principal symbol @xmath22 of the quantum hamiltonian @xmath14 , and similarly we use the principal symbols @xmath18 of the `` other hamiltonians '' together with @xmath22 to define a classically integrable system .",
    "these principal symbols are independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this approach is necessary in the multidimensional case because the full symbols @xmath40 of the operators @xmath19 do not poisson commute in general , except when @xmath42 .",
    "a consequence is that in this paper notations for functions on phase space such as @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , etc .",
    ", are independent of @xmath0 , whereas in i the analogous notations were allowed to have an @xmath0 dependence .    as in i",
    ", we begin by performing a canonical scaling of the operators @xmath46 and @xmath47 to give them both units of @xmath48 .",
    "this allows us to use a symmetrized form in ( [ ijdef ] ) below for the harmonic oscillator actions , and it means that all subsequent transformations preserve physical units .",
    "see [ normalformexample ] for an example .",
    "the main part of the calculation is to transform the set of operators @xmath49 via unitary conjugation into a new set of operators @xmath50 that are functions of the harmonic oscillators @xmath51 in the various degrees of freedom .",
    "the harmonic oscillators and their symbols are given by @xmath52 ( see [ notation ] ) .",
    "the @xmath53 or @xmath54 are standard harmonic oscillators of unit frequency , which are their own actions .",
    "the new operators @xmath55 are considered functions of the harmonic oscillators @xmath53 if their symbols @xmath56 are functions of the symbols @xmath54 in a neighborhood of the generic , stable fixed point of the classical hamiltonian @xmath22 , in the sense of formal power series in @xmath0 .",
    "we denote the assumed fixed point by @xmath57 . here",
    "we rely on the theorem , the one - dimensional analog of which was discussed in i , that an operator is a function of the operators @xmath53 if and only if its symbol is a function of the symbols @xmath54 ( see [ hosymbols ] ) .",
    "as in i , the transformation from the operators @xmath19 to operators @xmath55 proceeds in two stages . in the first stage ( the `` preparatory transformation '' )",
    "we seek a unitary transformation @xmath58 such that the operators @xmath59 , defined by @xmath60 have principal symbols @xmath61 that are functions of the harmonic oscillator actions @xmath54 .",
    "that is , the symbol @xmath62 of the operator @xmath59 is required to be a function of the harmonic oscillator actions @xmath63 to lowest order in @xmath0 .    in the second stage ,",
    "we seek a sequence of near - identity unitary operators @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , etc .",
    ", such that the operators @xmath55 , defined by @xmath67 where @xmath68 as in ( ) , have symbols @xmath56 that are formally functions of the harmonic oscillator actions @xmath54 to all orders in @xmath0 .",
    "each @xmath69 is given in terms of a hermitian generator @xmath70 by ( ) , and is responsible for transforming the symbols of the hamiltonians into functions of the @xmath54 at order @xmath71 ( only even @xmath27 are used ) .",
    "the two stages can be summarized schematically by @xmath72 all this is very much as in i , but note that a single unitary operator @xmath73 simultaneously transforms all the operators @xmath19 into the operators @xmath59 , and a single set of operators @xmath74 transforms all the operators @xmath59 into operators @xmath55 .",
    "the multidimensional method for finding @xmath73 and the operators @xmath59 is similar to the one - dimensional case .",
    "first we assume that @xmath58 is given , and we work out expressions for the symbol @xmath62 of the transformed hamiltonians @xmath59 .",
    "then we impose conditions on these symbols ( namely , that the principal symbols @xmath61 should be functions of the @xmath54 ) .",
    "we assume that @xmath58 can be imbedded in a smooth family @xmath75 of unitary operators with boundary values at @xmath76 and @xmath77 as shown in table  [ table ] .",

    "next we define the hermitian operator @xmath78 by ( ) , exactly as in i. the symbol @xmath79 of operator @xmath78 of interest to us will be constructed out of the classical mechanics associated with the integrable system defined by the principal symbols @xmath18 . since these have no @xmath0 dependence , neither does @xmath79 ( unlike the case of i ) .",

    "[ thecalculation ] that supply details of the calculation .      in this subsection",
    "we develop the classical normal form transformation @xmath111 in a small neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath57 of the hamiltonian @xmath22 , in which the functions @xmath18 are well approximated by their quadratic expansions about @xmath57 .",
    "( properly , this discussion should be framed in terms of tangent spaces and germs of smooth functions , but we shall proceed somewhat intuitively . ) at this level of description , @xmath111 is a linear canonical transformation ( the linearization of the fully nonlinear @xmath111 defined over the region of interest ) . to begin we list the assumptions we make about the behavior of the principal symbols @xmath18 in a neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath57 .",
    "these amount to taking the most generic case of a stable fixed point of an integrable system .",
    "we assume that all symbols @xmath40 ( that is , all the terms @xmath43 of their @xmath0 expansions ) are smooth in a neighborhood of @xmath57 .",
    "this excludes the case of singular potentials , such as the coulomb potential .",
    "we define @xmath190 as the @xmath191 real , symmetric hessian matrix of the principal symbol @xmath18 evaluated at @xmath57 , @xmath192 we assume that @xmath193 ( the hessian of the hamiltonian ) is positive or negative definite , corresponding to stable motion about the fixed point . for convenience ,",
    "if @xmath193 is negative definite , we agree to replace @xmath14 by @xmath194 at the beginning of the calculation , so that in the following we can assume that @xmath193 is positive definite .",
    "the @xmath190 for @xmath195 need not be definite ( positive or negative ) .",
    "we assume that the set of matrices @xmath196 is linearly independent . for simplicity",
    ", we assume that all the principal symbols @xmath18 vanish at @xmath57 ( if not , we just subtract constants from the operators @xmath19 to make this so ) .",
    "these assumptions imply that the first derivatives of the @xmath18 at the fixed point , denoted by @xmath197 all vanish . for @xmath198 ,",
    "this follows from the assumption that @xmath57 is a fixed point of @xmath22 . for @xmath195 ,",

    "now we define a canonical transformation @xmath111 in terms of the symplectic matrix @xmath215 produced by this theorem , @xmath219 this allows us to combine ( [ hj0expansion ] ) and ( [ matrixnormalform ] ) to give @xmath220 thus , under the transformation @xmath111 ( or @xmath221 ) , the hamiltonians @xmath18 are mapped into functions of the harmonic oscillators @xmath54 ( in fact , linear functions ) . therefore we identify this @xmath111 with the transformation @xmath111 used in ( [ kj0solution ] ) , and we have the desired normal form transformation in a small neighborhood of the fixed point , @xmath222      the level sets of the harmonic oscillator actions @xmath54 ( say , @xmath223 , for @xmath224 ) are @xmath27-tori , where @xmath27 is the number of the @xmath225 that do not vanish .",
    "thus , @xmath226 , and the subset of @xmath227 that contains tori of dimension @xmath228 is the union of a set of @xmath229 planes of dimension @xmath230 passing through the origin . on the other hand , ( [ linearnormalform ] )",
    "shows that @xmath111 maps the level sets of the functions @xmath18 near @xmath57 onto those of the harmonic oscillators @xmath54 near the origin .",
    "thus , the level sets of the @xmath18 near @xmath57 are also tori of dimension ranging from 0 to @xmath2 that fit together exactly like those of the harmonic oscillators @xmath54 near the origin .",
    "we shall call these two sets of tori the `` @xmath127-tori '' and the `` @xmath128-tori . ''    to visualize how the tori of various dimension fit together , we consider the two maps , @xmath231 where @xmath232 can be thought of as `` constant - of - motion space . '' these are examples of the energy - momentum map discussed by cushman and bates ( 1997 ) .",
    "we call these the `` @xmath127-map '' and the `` @xmath128-map , '' respectively .",
    "these maps and others associated with them are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ emmapsinfinitesimal ] .",
    "an entire level set of the functions @xmath18 or @xmath54 is mapped by these two maps into a single point of constant - of - motion space . in the following",
    "we think of the domain of the @xmath127-map as a small region @xmath233 around @xmath57 ( an open ball ) .",
    "the domain of the @xmath128-map may be taken to be all of @xmath227 , but we shall often be interested in the small region @xmath234 around the origin ( so @xmath235 is also an open ball ) .",
    "the images of these maps are the sets of values the constants of motion , @xmath18 or @xmath54 , can take on .",
    "the image of @xmath227 under the @xmath128-map is the region @xmath236 , for @xmath237 , for example , it is a single octant of @xmath238 when @xmath239 .",
    "thus , the image of @xmath235 under the @xmath128-map looks like a corner of an @xmath2-cube that has been sliced off in such a manner that the cut does not pass through the vertex itself , as illustrated by the shaded area in the upper right of fig .",
    "[ emmapsinfinitesimal ] .",
    "the sliced corner has flat faces of dimensionality @xmath27 , ranging from 0 to @xmath2 , where the @xmath240 face is the vertex ( the origin of @xmath232 ) , and the @xmath241 face is the entire sliced corner . in the figure ,",
    "the 1-faces are heavy lines , coinciding with the positive axes .",
    "the inverse image of a point in the interior of an @xmath27-face of the sliced corner is a torus in @xmath227 of dimensionality @xmath27 .    by throwing out all the faces with @xmath242",
    ", we can create an open , contractible region of @xmath232 , whose inverse image under the @xmath128-map is the set of invariant @xmath2-tori of the harmonic oscillators .",
    "this set is topologically the cartesian product of the just mentioned region and an @xmath2-torus .",
    "thus , the subset of phase space @xmath243 containing the @xmath2-tori is connected and has the form of a trivial fiber bundle in which the fiber is an @xmath2-torus .",
    "now let @xmath244 for @xmath237 be a level set of the @xmath18 near @xmath57 , which is mapped by @xmath111 onto a level set @xmath245 near the origin .",
    "then by ( [ linearnormalform ] ) we have @xmath246 which means that the image of @xmath233 under the @xmath127-map is just a linear transformation ( specified by @xmath217 ) applied to the image of @xmath235 under the @xmath128-map ( the sliced corner of the @xmath2-cube ) .",
    "in particular , all the level sets of the functions @xmath18 that are @xmath2-tori correspond to interior points of the sliced corner of the @xmath2-cube , while tori of lower dimension reside on the surface .",
    "thus , the image of @xmath233 under the @xmath127-map has a `` corner . ''",
    "see , for example , fig .  3.3 in chapter  iv in cushman and bates ( 1997 ) ( in that figure , the corner does not occur at the origin of @xmath232 , because the constants of motion do not take on the value 0 at the fixed point ) .",
    "now we consider basis contours on the various tori .",
    "a set of closed contours on a torus constitutes a basis if any closed contour can be represented as a linear combination of the basis contours with integer coefficients , with the understanding that two closed contours are considered equal if they can be continuously deformed into one another .",
    "that is , the contours form a basis of the first homology group @xmath247 of the torus , with homologous contours considered equal . on a specific @xmath2-torus ,",
    "the choices of basis contours are related by @xmath184 transformations ( see [ notation ] ) .    as for the @xmath128-tori ,",
    "the functions @xmath248 are themselves actions of these tori , that is , there exist basis contours @xmath249 on the @xmath128-tori such that @xmath250 specifically , we shall take the contour @xmath84 to be the circle in the @xmath251-@xmath252 plane whose radius is determined by the contour value of @xmath54 , with the other @xmath253 and @xmath254 fixed .",
    "this gives a smooth assignment of contours @xmath84 on the @xmath128-tori over all of @xmath243 , and hence over the region @xmath235 .",
    "as for basis contours on the @xmath127-tori , we could take these to be @xmath255 , where we think of the @xmath84 as maps from the circle onto phase space , @xmath256 , but in practice other basis contours on the @xmath127-tori , call them @xmath181 , may be more convenient ( for example , see [ normalformexample ] ) . on each @xmath127-torus , the contours @xmath181 must be related to @xmath257 by an element @xmath258 , so that @xmath259 by requiring that @xmath125 be the same for all @xmath127-tori , the contours @xmath181 constitute a smooth assignment of basis contours over the @xmath127-tori in the small region @xmath233 .",
    "once the @xmath181 are given , the actions @xmath30 are defined for @xmath260 @xmath261 and they are smooth functions over @xmath233",
    ". then since the symplectic 2-form @xmath262 is invariant under the canonical transformation @xmath111 , we can map the integral ( [ ajdef ] ) from the @xmath127-torus to the @xmath128-torus to obtain @xmath263 which is the first half of ( [ zdef ] ) , here established over small neighborhood @xmath233 around @xmath57 .",
    "as for the angles , we first define the harmonic oscillator angles @xmath82 as the clockwise angles in the @xmath251-@xmath252 plane , vanishing on the positive @xmath252-axis ( a convenient definition )",
    ". then the second half of ( [ zdef ] ) can be taken as the definition of the angles @xmath41 of the @xmath127-tori .",
    "finally we combine ( [ linearnormalform ] ) and ( [ ajlcofik ] ) to obtain , @xmath264 which gives the form of the functions @xmath265 in neighborhood @xmath233 . differentiating this and using ( [ omegajkdef ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath266 where the frequency matrix is considered a function of the actions @xmath33 , and is here evaluated at @xmath267 ( corresponding to the fixed point ) .",
    "this matrix is nonsingular , since both @xmath217 and @xmath268 are nonsingular .",
    "this completes the classical normal form transformation in a small neighborhood of the fixed point @xmath57 .",
    "[ normalformexample ] contains a physical example of this transformation , in which all the constructions of this subsection are carried out explicitly .      in this subsection",
    "we discuss the definition of the `` region of interest '' , denoted @xmath269 , an enlargement of the small neighborhood @xmath233 of the fixed point @xmath57 which is the domain of the ( generally nonlinear ) canonical transformation @xmath111 that brings about the classical normal form ( [ kj0solution ] ) and satisfies ( [ zdef ] ) .",
    "the situation is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mapsroi ] , which is a modified version of fig .",
    "[ emmapsinfinitesimal ] .",
    "the region @xmath269 and the fixed point @xmath57 are shown in the lower left corner of this figure .",
    "the transformation @xmath111 maps @xmath269 onto the region @xmath270 , upon which the harmonic oscillator actions @xmath128 are defined .",
    "the mappings @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the same in fig .",
    "[ mapsroi ] as in fig .",
    "[ emmapsinfinitesimal ] , except for the expansion of the domains .",
    "note that in subsection  [ normalformquadratic ] , the notation @xmath111 stood for the linearization of the @xmath111 that we are discussing in this subsection .",
    "for example , ( [ zdeflinearized ] ) must now be understood as @xmath271 with @xmath272 .",
    "a simple approach to understanding the transformation @xmath111 is just to say that it maps the action - angle variables of the hamiltonians @xmath273 into those of the harmonic oscillators @xmath54 , as in ( [ zdef ] ) .",
    "this approach requires the action - angle variables for @xmath18 to be defined .",
    "then @xmath111 is canonical because it is the composition of two canonical transformations .",
    "moreover it is easy to see that @xmath111 is smooth , except possibly where the @xmath2-tori degenerate into tori of lower dimension and some of the angles become undefined . in",
    "i worries about the smoothness of @xmath111 at the fixed point led us to take another approach , in which the morse lemma was used first to construct @xmath111 , and then @xmath111 was used to define the angles @xmath35 ( see ) .",
    "nevertheless , the simpler approach is still useful , in that it shows that the domain of @xmath111 in the one - dimensional problem can be extended out from the fixed point to the first separatrix , where the action - angle variables become undefined .    in the multidimensional case",
    ", the construction of @xmath111 can again be based on symplectic generalizations of the morse lemma .",
    "this has been done by eliasson ( 1990 ) , in more generality than we need here . in the following",
    "we shall simply assume the existence of a smooth , symplectic map @xmath274 such that @xmath272 and such that @xmath127-tori are mapped onto @xmath128-tori . as in i , we shall take @xmath269 to be the largest region containing @xmath57 over which the entire construction works ; @xmath269 is required to be a union of invariant @xmath127-tori . in the multidimensional case , however , obstacles to the extension of the domain @xmath269 include not only separatrices but also pinched tori and other kinds of nongeneric level sets of the functions @xmath18 .",
    "the following remarks are useful for visualizing the kinds of such level sets that can arise in the multidimensional case .",
    "first we comment on the liouville - arnold theorem , which says that if the differentials @xmath275 are linearly independent on a compact , connected component of a level set of the poisson commuting functions @xmath18 , then that level set is a lagrangian @xmath2-torus . by the assumptions we have made , the levels sets of the @xmath18 are certainly compact in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath57 , because the level sets of @xmath22 alone are compact there ( they are the spheres @xmath276 ) .",
    "but the differentials @xmath275 are not necessarily linearly independent on those level sets , even in a small neighborhood of @xmath57 , as shown by the invariant @xmath27-tori for @xmath242 , which exist arbitrarily close to @xmath57 in the manner described in subsection  [ cnftorismall ] .",
    "for example , at the fixed point itself ( a 0-torus ) , the differentials @xmath275 all vanish .",
    "we consider the rank of the set of differentials @xmath277 to be the rank of the @xmath278 matrix @xmath279 .",
    "this rank is constant along any hamiltonian flow generated by any of the @xmath18 , as are the hamiltonian functions @xmath18 themselves .",
    "the commuting hamiltonian flows associated with the @xmath18 define an @xmath232-action on phase space , assuming that the advance maps exist for all time .",
    "thus a level set of the @xmath18 consists of a union of orbits of the @xmath232-action , upon each of which the rank of the differentials @xmath275 is constant .",
    "each of these orbits is diffeomorphic to @xmath280 , where @xmath281 ( a generalized cylinder ) , where @xmath282 is the 1-torus ( a circle ) , and where the dimension of the orbit @xmath27 equals the rank of the differentials @xmath275 .",
    "the differentials @xmath275 can fail to be linearly independent on a level set in different ways . the @xmath27-tori for @xmath242 that exist even near the fixed point are composed of a single orbit of the @xmath283-action , upon which the rank of the differentials is @xmath27 .",
    "the separatrix in a double well oscillator in one dimension consists of three orbits of the @xmath284-action , the two orbits that asymptote to the fixed point as @xmath285 , each diffeomorphic to @xmath286 , and the fixed point itself , a 0-torus .",
    "generalizations of this behavior occur in higher dimensions .",
    "another example is offered by the pinched torus of the spherical pendulum , which exhibits the phenomenon of monodromy ( duistermaat 1980 , cushman and duistermaat 1988 , cushman and bates 1997 , alber 1998 , child 1998 , cushman 2004 ) . in this case",
    "the pinched torus minus the pinch point is a 2-dimensional surface diffeomorphic to @xmath287 , while the pinch point itself is a 0-torus .",
    "another issue concerns the definitions of the actions @xmath30 as smooth functions @xmath288 , which requires a smooth assignment of basis contours over the @xmath127-tori in @xmath269 .",
    "consider a region of phase space in which the differentials @xmath275 are linearly independent and the level sets of the @xmath18 are @xmath2-tori , and then consider the image of that region under the @xmath127-map .",
    "this image can be taken to be the base space of a discrete , principal fiber bundle , in which the fiber over a point is the set of all basis contours on the corresponding @xmath2-torus .",
    "the structure group of this bundle is @xmath184 , which relates the sets of basis contours .",
    "a smooth assignment of basis contours as a field over the base space is equivalent to a global section of this bundle , which exists if and only if the bundle is trivial .",
    "but such bundles are nontrivial precisely where monodromy occurs ( this is the meaning of monodromy ) .",
    "notice that if we have a smooth @xmath111 that maps @xmath127-tori in some region onto @xmath128-tori , we can pull back the basis contours of the @xmath128-tori , which can be smoothly assigned , to create a smooth assignment of basis contours on the @xmath127-tori . thus , monodromy can not occur in the domain of any such @xmath111 , such as the region @xmath269 considered here . in the example of monodromy given in fig .",
    "3.3 , chapter iv of cushman and bates ( 1997 ) , one would have to introduce a branch cut terminating on the pinch point in order to create a region @xmath269 free of monodromy .",
    "there is no unique way to do this , and hence no unique , maximal set @xmath269 upon which @xmath111 is defined .",
    "finally , we impose the requirement that @xmath269 be contractible , since this guarantees the existence of the generator @xmath79 ( see ) .",
    "note that this condition by itself guarantees that any bundle over @xmath269 is trivial .",
    "to proceed we assume @xmath111 is defined on some suitable set @xmath269 , and that its linearization at @xmath57 agrees with the transformation previously worked out in subsection  [ normalformquadratic ] .",
    "a smooth assignment of basis contours @xmath181 on the @xmath127-tori in @xmath269 is made according to ( [ zcontourmap ] ) , where @xmath125 is the same matrix constructed in the small neighborhood of @xmath57 ( it is extended to all of @xmath269 ) .",
    "then ( [ ajlcofik ] ) holds in all of @xmath269 , and maps @xmath33 and @xmath125 in fig .",
    "[ mapsroi ] are defined and satisfy @xmath289 .",
    "one nonobvious conclusion from this is that the boundaries of the image of the @xmath33-map are flat ( straight lines in fig .",
    "[ mapsroi ] ) .",
    "another conclusion is that the actions @xmath30 uniquely label the @xmath127-tori , that is , no two @xmath127-tori in @xmath269 have the same actions .",
    "this follows since the actions @xmath54 uniquely label the @xmath128-tori .",
    "this means that the map @xmath118 in fig .",
    "[ mapsroi ] is defined , for if we take a point in the image of the @xmath33-map , its inverse image is an invariant @xmath127-torus , upon which the values of the @xmath18 are defined .",
    "thus , @xmath290 as in ( [ fj0def ] ) . moreover , the map @xmath118 is of maximal rank ( @xmath2 ) and therefore invertible in the region containing @xmath2-tori , where the differentials @xmath275 are linearly independent .",
    "this means that the frequency matrix @xmath291 is invertible in this region .",
    "the frequency matrix can be defined on the boundaries of the image of the @xmath33-map by a limiting process ; this limit is nonsingular at the fixed point ( see ( [ omegaanu ] ) ) .",
    "we shall assume that the limit at other points on the boundary is also nonsingular ( this excludes the possibility that the kind of nongeneric behavior seen in the quartic oscillator in one dimension might develop as we move along the space of tori of dimension @xmath242 ) .",
    "thus , the image of the @xmath127-map is a smooth deformation of the truncated corner of the @xmath2-cube , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ mapsroi ] ( with corners and curved faces ) .",
    "these features are clear in the example of fig .  3.3 , chapter iv of cushman and bates ( 1997 ) .",

    "in both i and this paper , the @xmath86-integrals that arose in the computation of the normal form function @xmath304 all turned out to be doable , at least through second order in @xmath0 , although the methods employed were _ ad hoc _ and no proof was given that the same could be done at higher orders .",
    "see  and [ antiderivative ] . in principle",
    "it would be possible to carry out the normal form transformation using the integral representation of the moyal star product , so that the conjugation ( [ kjdef ] ) could be evaluated by the stationary phase approximation .",
    "this approach would avoid the necessity of imbedding @xmath58 or @xmath111 in a one - parameter family of transformations , and there would be no @xmath86-dependent paths through various group manifolds to integrate over .",
    "( but one would have to work with the rapidly oscillating symbol @xmath233 of @xmath73 , something we have avoided in the approach of this paper . )",
    "the existence of this alternative approach suggests that all @xmath86-integrals that arise in the present approach that are needed for the normal form are doable , that is , the integrals can be expressed in terms of the transformations at the end points of the path ( that is , @xmath131 evaluated at @xmath100 ) , and do not depend on the path itself .",
    "an @xmath86-integral that is independent of path must mean that in some sense we are integrating an exact 1-form on the infinite - dimensional group manifold .",
    "see 2 , in which the @xmath86-integral occurring in the expression for @xmath305 in the one - dimensional case was shown to change by an exact @xmath139-derivative upon a variation of the path , that is , exactly what was needed to guarantee that the normal form be invariant .",
    "the calculation of the variation of the @xmath86-integral in that case relied on the star version of the jacobi identity .",
    "it is likely that a general understanding of the path dependence of the @xmath86-integrals in the general case ( multidimensional , arbitrary order in @xmath0 ) would result by following the suggestions raised by this calculation .",
    "a striking aspect of the quantization rule ( [ theresult ] ) is the presence of the angles angles @xmath306 in the first diagram of the second order term , which we see if we write @xmath307 .",
    "this diagram is the difficult one derived in [ antiderivative ] .",
    "the appearance of angles in the quantization condition requires some discussion .",
    "first , we note that in the one - dimensional problem the angles can be eliminated from the quantization condition .",
    "this is shown to second order in @xmath0 by the actual result in i , and to fourth order by gracia - saz ( 2005 ) , who used colin de verdire s ( 2004 ) method for computing the eigenvalue series combined with his own theory of the symbol of a function of an operator .",
    "in fact , it is implicit in gracia - saz s work that the angles can be eliminated to all orders in @xmath0 in the one - dimensional problem .",
    "next , we note that the angles are not unique , since their origin on each torus ( the point where the angles are taken to vanish ) can be chosen with a great deal of freedom .",
    "that is , given one set of action - angle variables @xmath23 , it is always possible to subject them to a canonical transformation of the form , @xmath308 where @xmath309 is some function of the actions .",
    "geometrically , the surface @xmath310 is required to be a lagrangian manifold .",
    "the quantization condition ( [ theresult ] ) must be independent of such a shift in the origin of the angles .    to show that it is , we write the @xmath35-dependent diagram in ( [ theresult ] ) as @xmath311 & a^j       \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] & d_\\mu } =      -\\xymatrix@c=1pc{\\phi^k \\ar[r ] & a^j       \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] & a^k } +      \\xymatrix@c=1pc{a^k \\ar[r ] & a^j       \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] & \\phi^k}.      \\label{2phidiagrams}\\ ] ] under the replacement @xmath312 ,",
    "the right hand side goes into itself plus the sum of three terms , of which two cancel by simple symmetry considerations .",
    "the remaining term is @xmath313 & a^j \\ar[ur ] \\ar[dr ] \\\\      & & a^m } } ,      \\label{3angleterms}\\ ] ] which by identity ( [ wheelidentity ] ) can be written as an exact @xmath41-derivative , @xmath314 & ( a^k \\ar[r ] & a^l \\ar[r ]      & a^m ) } =      - \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi^j } [ f_{,klm }      \\xymatrix@c=1pc{(a^k \\ar[r ] & a^l \\ar[r ]      & a^m ) ] } ,      \\label{anglecorrectionterm}\\ ] ] which vanishes upon the @xmath35-averaging in ( [ theresult ] ) . therefore , although the diagram ( [ 2phidiagrams ] ) itself is not invariant under the shift of origin ( [ angleoriginshift ] ) , its angle average is , and hence so is the quantization condition ( [ theresult ] ) .",
    "a third aspect of the appearance of angles in the torus quantization rule ( [ theresult ] ) is that in practice angles are much harder to compute than actions , either numerically or as explicit functions of @xmath315 s and @xmath316 s , and what is worse is computing the derivatives of the angles with respect to @xmath317 .",
    "this makes a numerical test of the quantization rule ( [ theresult ] ) difficult .",
    "since the quantization condition itself does not depend on the origin of the angles , one wonders whether there is a method of computing the second order term that does not rely on this origin , either .",
    "we do not know the answer , but the following are some relevant considerations .    first , not all diagrams with angles cause difficulties .",
    "for example , the angle average of a diagram of the form @xmath318 & ( x)}$ ] , where @xmath178 is any diagram , can be written in the form , @xmath319 & ( x ) } \\right>_\\phi =      \\left < \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial a^k } \\right > _ \\phi =      \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a^k } \\left < x \\right>_\\phi ,      \\label{innocuousdiagram}\\ ] ] in which the operator @xmath320 has been taken out of the average .",
    "this operator , when applied to a function of both @xmath33 and @xmath35 , is not invariant under the transformation ( [ angleoriginshift ] ) , but it is so when applied to a function of @xmath33 only .",
    "in fact , such action derivatives , outside an averaging operator , occur in the one - dimensional quantization rule .",
    "one might hope to transform the difficult diagram into another one that is independent of the origin of the angles , plus terms that average to zero .",
    "we doubt that this can be done , but the following identity is a interesting attempt along these lines : @xmath321 & a^k \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ]       \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] & d_\\mu } =      \\xymatrix@c=1pc{d^\\mu \\ar[r ] & ( a^k \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ]       \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] & d_\\mu ) } +      \\vcenter {      \\xymatrix@c=0pc@r=0.8pc { & a^k \\ar[dl ] \\ar[dr ] \\\\      d^\\mu \\ar[rr ] & & d_\\mu } }      \\nonumber \\\\      \\qquad = -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial a^l }      \\xymatrix@c=1pc{(a^k \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] &      a^l ) }      -\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\phi^l }      \\xymatrix@c=1pc{(a^k \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] &      \\phi^l ) }      -2 \\vcenter {      \\xymatrix@c=0pc@r=0.8pc { & a^k \\ar[dl ] \\ar[dr ] \\\\      \\phi^l \\ar[rr ] & & a^l } } ,      \\label{harddiagramident }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where to prove the first step we expand the first term after the equals sign by the chain rule and use the expansion of the vanishing diagram @xmath322 & d_\\mu ) \\ar@<-0.5ex>[r ] \\ar@<0.5ex>[r ] & a^k}$ ] , and where the second step follows by using ( [ dmudef ] ) , expanding poisson brackets in the @xmath36 coordinates , and using the symmetries of the triangle diagram ( see ( [ trianglediagram ] ) ) and ( ) .",
    "the first term on the right hand side of ( [ harddiagramident ] ) is of the type indicated in ( [ innocuousdiagram ] ) ( hence , independent of origin of the angles after averaging ) and the second term vanishes upon averaging .",
    "unfortunately , the third term still depends on the origin of the angles , except in one dimension ( see subsection  [ reduction1d ] ) .      by introducing a symplectic connection ( bayen ( 1978 ) , fedosov ( 1994 ) ) the derivatives with respect to @xmath317 that appear in the definition of a diagram",

    "the result is equivalent to @xmath327 which is completely symmetric in indices @xmath328 , as may be seen by differentiating ( [ lagrangebracketxfm ] ) .    with these connection coefficients we can compute any diagram in terms of covariant derivatives in action - angle coordinates .",
