    "at present time the heavy - ion therapy of cancer is one of the most advanced methods in radiation therapy  @xcite",
    ". an elevated biological effectiveness of accelerated nuclei provides advantages in treatment of radioresistant solid tumors , but also requires a thorough treatment planning to reduce undesirable impact of radiation on healthy tissues .",
    "this should include , in particular , a realistic description of the production of secondary nuclear fragments .",
    "such secondary particles deliver dose to the tissues located farther than the bragg peak for primary nuclei and also around the primary beams .",
    "recently there were several experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies which confirmed the need to consider nuclear fragmentation reactions in heavy - ion therapy .",
    "in particular , as shown by measurements with a 400@xmath4  mev @xmath0c beam ( with kinetic energy of  400 mev per nucleon ) , about 70% of beam nuclei undergo fragmentation reactions  @xcite . apart from the effect of primary beam attenuation",
    ", this means that the dose around the beam is delivered by light charged fragments , ( e.g. protons and helium nuclei ) and also by neutrons .",
    "in particular , neutrons may propagate large distances from their production points before they initiate secondary nuclear reactions .",
    "as demonstrated by studies with various transport codes , such as shield - hit  @xcite , fluka and geant4  @xcite , the measured attenuation of the primary carbon beam and production of heavier fragments are generally well reproduced by the theory . however , as follows from the same studies , there are problems with quantitative description of the yields , angular distributions and energy spectra for several kinds of fragments produced in fragmentation reactions in water . in particular , the yields of alpha - particles are underestimated .",
    "this may be related to neglecting the cluster structure of light nuclei , which leads to the underestimation of decays of excited nuclei into channels containing alphas .",
    "it is unlikely that such deficiency will be eliminated soon , as this will require combining dynamical and statistical models of nuclear reactions with sophisticated nuclear structure models into a unified , but still computationally effective tool .",
    "nuclear fragmentation models calculate the yields of secondary fragments as functions of their charges and velocities .",
    "however , the impact of specific particle species on living cells is rather correlated with their linear energy transfer ( let ) values .",
    "the lets of particles with different charges @xmath5 , but similar velocities in first approximation are proportional to their @xmath6 . at the same time ions of different velocities and charges",
    "may have similar let  @xcite .",
    "therefore , the reliability of nuclear fragmentation models , in particular used in geant4 calculations  @xcite , should be also evaluated with respect to calculations of let or related quantities .",
    "the biological action of radiation is commonly characterized by microdosimetric quantities  @xcite such as lineal energy @xmath7 , its probability density @xmath8 and dose probability density @xmath9 .",
    "frequency - mean , @xmath1 , and dose - mean , @xmath10 , lineal energies are defined as the first moments of the corresponding distributions , see section  [ sec : basicsmicro ] for their definitions .",
    "these distributions are routinely measured by means of tissue equivalent proportional counters ( tepc )  @xcite .    in a complex radiation field",
    "different particles can eventually contribute with similar @xmath7 .",
    "therefore , the resulting @xmath7-distribution is build as the sum of contributions from primary and all secondary particles passing tepc .",
    "measurements and calculations of microdosimetric quantities related to heavy - ion therapy were reported by several authors . in particular , microdosimetric quantities were used to characterize the biological dose from therapeutic @xmath0c beams  @xcite .",
    "similar measurements were performed for the first time for @xmath11li beams  @xcite .",
    "simulations with the phits code were done for a wall - less tepc  @xcite .",
    "the energy deposition inside and around @xmath11li and @xmath0c beams in water were calculated with shield - hit and fluka codes  @xcite , but without implementing the exact geometry of the tepc detector and , respectively , without calculating @xmath7-distributions .",
    "the fluka code was also used to simulate responses of tepc to various ions  @xcite , including @xmath7-distributions for tepcs located on the beam axis inside a water phantom irradiated by @xmath0c beam  @xcite .    in our previous papers",
    "@xcite we validated the geant4 toolkit  @xcite for use in heavy - ion therapy simulations .",
    "the depth - dose distributions  @xcite and production of positron - emitting nuclei  @xcite were calculated by means of the monte carlo model for heavy ion therapy ( mchit ) based on geant4 .",
    "special effort was made to evaluate the quality of nuclear fragmentation models  @xcite by comparing theoretical predictions with experimental data on fragment yields  @xcite .",
    "the main purpose of the present work consists in accurate modeling of in - field and out - of - field microdosimetry spectra , their averages and contributions from secondary neutrons for pencil - like @xmath0c beams , which are typical for facilities with scanned therapeutic beams . in this case",
    "a tepc placed in a water phantom is impacted by a complex radiation field .",
    "it is either irradiated by a mixture of beam nuclei and secondary fragments or exposed exclusively to such fragments far from beam axis or beyond the bragg peak .    in order to achieve the main goal of our study",
    "the following specific issues are investigated :    * the sensitivity of calculational results to the choice of the geant4 models and their parameters for nuclear reactions and production and transport of secondary electrons , e.g. to the production thresholds ; * the accuracy of the mchit model in describing microdosimetry spectra of quasi - monoenergetic neutrons as a prerequisite for estimating the contribution of secondary neutrons from @xmath0c beam ; * the level of distortion of microdosimetry variables due to the impact of a focused @xmath0c beam with its width smaller than the tepc diameter , i.e. when the condition of random crossing of tepc by particles is violated or several nuclei of fragments traverse the tepc in a single event ; * the dose per beam particle at various points inside the water phantom and the distortion of the dose field measured with tepc due to its finite size and gradients of radiation field ; * the correspondence between calculated and measured @xmath1 and let of beam particles for various beam profiles and media surrounding tepc .",
    "it is known that the impact of charged particles on eukaryotic cells is defined not only by the energy imparted to the cell volume ( i.e. by the absorbed dose ) , but also by the total number and spatial correlations of local energy deposits to dna molecules inside the cell nucleus .",
    "such deposits lead to spatially distributed dna lesions caused mainly by free electrons which surround a track of a charged particle .",
    "the pattern of stochastic impacts on dna resulting in single , double or more complex breaks of dna strands essentially depends on the projectile charge , mass and velocity .",
    "it is defined by the number of electrons per unit of the track length as well as on their energies .",
    "all these characteristics differ for photon , electron , proton and nuclear beams .",
    "in particular , carbon nuclei successfully used for particle therapy of cancer are characterized by elevated biological effectiveness in the bragg peak region as compared to photons and protons  @xcite .",
    "thus , these biological effects of ion beams should be taken into account while developing the treatment planning systems used in particle therapy  @xcite .",
    "since dna molecules are typically confined inside cell nuclei , which are structures of a few - micrometer size , it is desirable to study energy deposition patterns at the micrometer scale . in particular ,",
    "the in - beam microscopy is used in experiments on irradiation of living cells . with this tool ,",
    "the tracks of charged particles can be well explored , if visualized by biological markers for dna damage  @xcite .    since many years measurements with tissue - equivalent proportional counters ( tepc )  @xcite",
    "are considered as a practical tool for studying patterns of energy deposition to micrometer - size objects by various kinds of radiation .",
    "the tepc considered in this paper has a chamber with an inner diameter of 12.7  mm filled with low - pressure tissue - equivalent ( te ) gas  @xcite .",
    "it emulates a tissue - equivalent region of a micrometer size . in this way the energy deposited to the sensitive gas volume of this device can be related to the energy that would be deposited to a cell nucleus  @xcite .",
    "as demonstrated by several authors , see e.g.  @xcite , microdosimetric variables are directly related to the radiation quality factor used to quantify risks from various kinds of radiation .    due to the stochastic nature of particle transport in media , the amount of energy @xmath12 delivered to a sensitive volume representing a cell nucleus changes from one event to another .",
    "the value of @xmath12 in each energy deposition event can be measured by a tepc  @xcite , as the measured electronic signal is expected to be proportional to @xmath12 .",
    "this technique allows one to obtain the probability distributions for lineal energy @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the mean chord length of the sensitive volume used as a detector . if one assumes that particles representing a homogeneous radiation field traverse a spherical detector randomly at various impact parameters , then @xmath15 .",
    "there were several experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite studies of tepc responses to heavy - ions .",
    "in these measurements and calculations the dependence of @xmath12 on the impact parameter of the ion track was investigated in detail . as demonstrated by taddei and co - authors  @xcite , calculations based on the geant4 toolkit",
    "can successfully reproduce the performance of a tepc ( far west technology inc .",
    ", model let-1/2 ) irradiated by @xmath16he , @xmath0c , @xmath17o , @xmath18si and @xmath19fe nuclei .",
    "since lineal energy @xmath7 varies from one event to another , the frequency - mean lineal energy @xmath1 , which characterizes the probability density @xmath8 , can be introduced  @xcite : @xmath20 the value of @xmath1 is the first moment of @xmath8 and serves as a measurable approximation for let .    in the following",
    "also @xmath21-distributions , with @xmath22 defined as the dose probability density , will be considered .",
    "the dose - mean lineal energy @xmath10 is calculated as the second moment of the @xmath8-distribution divided by its first moment : @xmath23 the value of @xmath10 is related to the quality of radiation .    for a spherical sensitive volume filled with gas",
    "the total dose @xmath24 is given by a useful formula  @xcite : @xmath25 here @xmath26 corresponds to the diameter of the sensitive volume expressed in @xmath27 m , @xmath1 in kev/@xmath27 m and @xmath24 is obtained in gy .",
    "due to its compactness the tepc device can be located at various positions inside and outside of phantoms irradiated by therapeutic beams .",
    "the microdosimetry measurements with a monoenergetic 400@xmath4  mev @xmath0c beam  @xcite were made together with the identification of charges of secondary fragments by scintillation counters by the time - of - flight ( tof ) method . in this way",
    "the above - described microdosimetry technique supplements the measurements of fragment yields by particle identification made outside the phantom with more bulky detectors , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "further measurements were performed with phantoms irradiated by 290@xmath4  mev @xmath0c beam with a traditional walled tepc  @xcite , also with fragment charge identification , and later  @xcite with a wall - less counter without tagging fragments .",
    "recently the results of microdosimetry measurements with",
    "290@xmath4  mev spread out bragg peak ( sobp ) carbon - ion beam were also reported  @xcite . in all these measurements",
    "the tepcs were located at the beam axis .",
    "microdosimetry measurements on the beam axis as well as off - axis in a water phantom irradiated by a pencil - like @xmath0c beam were performed at gsi  @xcite .",
    "similar studies at carbon - ion and proton radiotherapy facilities with passive beam delivery were also performed at tepc positions outside the treatment field  @xcite .",
    "the collected microdosimetry data challenge the theoretical methods aimed to describe particle transport in tissue - like media .",
    "for the purposes of the present study we further developed our monte carlo model for heavy - ion therapy ( mchit )  @xcite to simulate microdosimetry measurements with tepc devices .",
    "the model is currently based on the geant4 toolkit  @xcite of version 9.4 with patch 02 .",
    "input parameters for a mchit run are provided via a set of user interface commands which define the beam particle , the energy distribution of the beam , its spot size , angular divergence , as well as the dimensions and composition of the phantom used in a particular experimental set - up .",
    "a detailed description of the physics models included in the geant4 toolkit is given in the geant4 physics reference manual  @xcite .",
    "a set of models which are relevant to a particular simulation problem should be activated by the application developer .",
    "such models are usually grouped in a physics list . in order to involve certain models into simulation",
    ", one can either use the so - called predefined physics lists , or implement customized physics lists , or even use a combination of these two options .",
    "the predefined physics lists are provided by geant4 developers and distributed along with the geant4 source code .",
    "it is convenient to use separate physics lists for electromagnetic and hadronic physics .",
    "the electromagnetic processes are described by means of several predefined physics lists of geant4 .",
    "the physics list called `` standard electromagnetic physics option 3 '' is recommended by the geant4 developers for simulations related to particle therapy .",
    "as demonstrated  @xcite , the measured positions of the bragg peak for carbon nuclei of various energies in water are well reproduced with this physics list .",
    "the involved physics models simulate the energy loss and straggling of primary and secondary charged particles due to interaction with atomic electrons .",
    "the multiple coulomb scattering of charged particles on atomic nuclei is also simulated .    at each simulation",
    "step the ionization energy loss of a charged particle is calculated according to the bethe - bloch formula or interpolated between values listed in a table , depending on the particle type and energy  @xcite . in particular , the bethe - bloch formula with the shell , density and high - order corrections is applied in _",
    "g4betheblochmodel _ to protons with kinetic energy above 2  mev .",
    "below 2  mev the stopping power parameterizations  @xcite are used for protons in _ g4braggmodel_. the same methods are applied to alpha particles taking into account the corresponding mass scaling with respect to proton .",
    "an interpolation of stopping power tables  @xcite is implemented in _",
    "g4ionparametrisedlossmodel _ to calculate electromagnetic energy loss of ions heavier than helium with energies relevant to our study , below 1000@xmath4  mev .",
    "the lowest kinetic energy for the production of @xmath28-electrons in this standard physic list is 990 ev .",
    "the emission of @xmath28-electrons with energies below 990  ev is not simulated , but their energies are attributed to the local energy deposition . another predefined physics list , which extends the capability of electromagnetic models to produce and transport @xmath28-electrons down to 100  ev , namely _ g4empenelope _ based on the penelope model  @xcite , was also used for investigation of the impact of this energy threshold for the production of secondary electrons .    in order to reduce the cpu time without affecting the accuracy of calculations ,",
    "different cuts for production of electrons were applied in different materials .",
    "they are listed in table  [ tab : cuts ] .",
    "@lllll & & + & & +  material & cut in & energy & cut in & energy + & range & threshold & range & threshold + & ( mm ) & ( kev ) & ( mm ) & ( kev ) + water & 0.1 & 85 .",

    "this limitation in the electromagnetic models amounts for a cut in range of 9  mm for the standard electromagnetic models and 3  mm for the penelope models . since 9",
    "mm is of the same order as the diameter of the sensitive volume , the comparison of results between the standard and penelope models helps to understand how this limitation undermines the results .    in a 1.27  mm - thin plastic shell of the tepc detector",
    "the cut in range for electrons was reduced to 10  @xmath27 m .",
    "this helps to simulate accurately grazing interactions of particles with the plastic shell , as secondary particles produced in plastic can propagate further into gas . according to the default settings of geant4",
    "there were no cuts for secondary nucleons and nuclear fragments , and all produced particles ( including electrons ) after their production are transported down to zero kinetic energy .",
    "a customized physics list was implemented for the description of hadronic processes .",
    "modifications in this physics list with respect to our previous publications concern the modeling of inelastic nucleus - nucleus interactions . in the present study we considered two geant4 models to describe the first stage of nucleus - nucleus collisions , namely , the light ion binary cascade ( g4bic ) and the quantum molecular dynamics ( g4qmd ) models . in our earlier publication  @xcite",
    "the g4bic and g4 abrasion models were employed to describe such reactions .",
    "recent improvements in the g4qmd code  @xcite , as well as the conclusions based on the comparison of g4bic and g4qmd  @xcite , suggest that the g4qmd model can be also successfully used for modeling nuclear fragmentation of carbon nuclei .",
    "therefore , in our calculations of microdosimetric distributions both options to simulate nuclear fragmentation , g4bic and g4qmd , were used .",
    "excited nuclear fragments are frequently produced in addition to free nucleons as a result of simulation of a nucleus - nucleus collision event by the g4bic and g4qmd models .",
    "therefore , the g4excitationhandler of geant4 is used to simulate subsequent decays of excited nuclear fragments by applying various de - excitation models depending on the mass and excitation energy of these fragments .    the fermi break - up model ( g4fermibreakup ) is applied to nuclei lighter than fluorine .",
    "it is designed to describe explosive disintegration of excited light nuclei  @xcite and it is highly relevant to collisions of light nuclei with nuclei of tissue - like materials .",
    "as demonstrated  @xcite g4bic linked with g4fermibreakup better describes the production of lithium and beryllium nuclei , as well as secondary neutrons by @xmath0c nuclei in water and pmma compared to the option of g4bic linked with the nuclear evaporation model . as demonstrated by bhlen et al .",
    "@xcite the combination of g4qmd and g4fermibreakup also describes data well .",
    "therefore , we used g4fermibreakup to de - excite light fragments also in the present work .",
    "we use the primitive scorer classes of geant4 to calculate physical quantities which characterize the tepc response in each event .",
    "the energy @xmath12 deposited to the tepc sensitive volume is calculated by means of the _ g4psenergydeposit _ scorer .",
    "this scorer stores a sum of particles energy deposits to the sensitive volume in each event . the number of tracks @xmath29 that pass through the tepc sensitive volume , but do not start or stop inside it , is calculated by employing _",
    "g4pspassagecellcurrent_. in particular , this means that numerous low - energy @xmath28-electrons which are produced by energetic nuclei and stopped inside the te gas are not counted by this scorer . finally , _",
    "g4pspassagetracklength _ is used to calculate the total track length @xmath30 inside the tepc sensitive volume in single and multi - particle events . with this scorer",
    "the track length is defined as the sum of step lengths of the particles inside the volume , and again only tracks which traverse the volume are taken into account .",
    "this means that newly - generated or stopped tracks inside the volume are excluded from the calculation of @xmath30 .",
    "the employed _",
    "scorer is thus insensitive to those secondary electrons which were produced by a fast particle inside the tepc sensitive volume , but stopped inside it .",
    "the total track length is scored in order to evaluate the mean track length through the detector for comparison with the mean chord length @xmath15 in the standard conditions for microdosimetry measurements .",
    "in this work we calculate microdosimetric distributions and compare them with results of two experiments  @xcite . in the first experiment a pmma phantom was irradiated by broad quasi - monoenergetic neutron beams at the japan atomic energy research institute ( jaeri ) . in the second experiment",
    "a water phantom was irradiated by carbon and lithium pencil - like beams at gsi .",
    "the same type of tepc device ( far west technology inc . , model let-1/2 ) was used by both groups .",
    "this allowed us to validate our calculational approach for this specific tepc model first with neutron irradiation data  @xcite , and then extend it to the gsi measurements  @xcite with @xmath0c beam . in a previous study  @xcite",
    "we demonstrated that mchit can estimate reasonable well the energy and angular spectra of secondary neutrons produced by 200@xmath4  mev carbon beam in thick water target .",
    "therefore , if mchit is able to reproduce microdosimetry spectra for neutrons measured with a tepc we believe that the contribution of secondary neutrons to the microdosimetry spectra for carbon beam measured with the same tepc device can be estimated with confidence .",
    "the actual tepc dimensions and the chemical composition of tepc materials were implemented as accurate as possible in our simulations .",
    "it was assumed that the tissue equivalent gas was propane c@xmath31h@xmath32 ( 55% ) with addition of co@xmath33 ( 39.6% ) and n@xmath33 ( 5.4% ) .",
    "a gas container was defined in simulations as a shell of tissue - equivalent plastic composed of h ( 10.1% ) , c ( 77.6% ) , n ( 3.5% ) , o ( 5.2% ) , f ( 1.7% ) and ca ( 1.9% ) , in accordance with the properties of the nist material shonka a-150 plastic .",
    "an aluminum outer shell of the tepc was also introduced , although simulation results were found to be rather insensitive to the presence of the al shell because of its small thickness .",
    "the central wire located inside the gas sphere was not considered in the simulations .",
    "following taddei et al .",
    "@xcite , it was assumed that quite rare events in which a projectile particle interacted with this wire are rejected in measurements .",
    "we also neglect the bending of the simulated tracks due to the voltage applied to the tepc .    experimental results for a tepc located at 5  cm depth inside the pmma phantom irradiated by 40  mev and 65  mev quasi - monoenergetic neutrons were selected from jaeri data to validate the mchit model .",
    "the pressure of the tissue equivalent gas was 9.03  kpa which emulated a tissue sphere of 2.07 @xmath27 m in diameter .    in the second experiment  @xcite a water phantom of @xmath34  @xmath35 ( including side walls made of pmma )",
    "was irradiated by a 300@xmath4  mev @xmath0c beam . in the simulations",
    "the parameters of the @xmath0c beam used at gsi were implemented as accurate as possible .",
    "the beam had a concentric spot with a size of 3  mm fwhm at beam exit window , an angular distribution with the gaussian profile of 1  mrad fwhm , and an energy distribution with the gaussian profile of 0.2% fwhm .",
    "the @xmath21-distributions per beam particle measured at nine points inside the water phantom were reported  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to 0  cm , 2  cm and 10  cm radii and to three values of depth : at the plateau of the depth - dose curve , at the bragg peak and in the tail region . in this experiment water",
    "was enclosed in a container with a 20  mm thick pmma wall .",
    "carbon nuclei also penetrated through a vacuum window made of aluminum , a scintillation detector and a parallel - plate ion chamber installed in front of the phantom .",
    "these beam - line elements and pmma walls of the phantom were estimated by martino et  al .",
    "as equivalent water thickness of 25.1  mm .",
    "this thickness was applied to the tepc depth in order to compare the data with simulation results , since calculations were performed with an equivalent wall - less water phantom of @xmath34  @xmath35 .",
    "it was found that a 2  mm shift to a deeper position of the tepc is required in order to reproduce the peak in the @xmath21 spectrum for the tepc positioned in the vicinity of the bragg peak on the beam axis as well as the depth - dose profile . at this position",
    "the microdosimetry spectrum is highly sensitive to a few millimeters shift of the device",
    ". one can attribute this shift to uncertainties in the measurements of tepc positions , beam energy and the equivalent water thickness in front of the water phantom .",
    "some inaccuracy of the electromagnetic physics models of geant4 can not be excluded as well . for consistency",
    "this shift was applied to all tepc positions as a systematic correction .",
    "the gas pressure was set to the experimental value of 12  kpa which corresponds to a sphere of tissue of 2.75  @xmath27 m in diameter .",
    "the tepc positions used in our simulations are listed in table  [ tab : tepcpositions ] .    using the axial symmetry of the set - up in the second experiment we replaced a single physical tepc by a ring of identical virtual tepcs located at the same depth and radial distance from the beam axis . during each",
    "run the lineal energy events were scored in a histogram corresponding to a particular ring . at the end of the run",
    "the number of events in each lineal energy bin were divided by the number of virtual counters in the ring and thus became equivalent to a single physical counter . with this method",
    "one can increase the simulated number of hits for those positions of counters where hits are scarce .",
    "this is particularly important for tepcs located at large distances , e.g. , at 10  cm , from the beam axis .",
    "the number of counters in each ring and the positions of the rings with respect to the beam axis were chosen to avoid any crosstalk impacts on the virtual detectors .",
    "this was done to satisfy the condition that the particles produced inside one of the virtual counters , or which have just traversed it , should not hit other counters .",
    "therefore , calculations for the nine tepc positions listed in table  [ tab : tepcpositions ] were split into three independent runs . during the run `` i '' three outer rings of tepcs of 10  cm in radius",
    "each consisting of 24 counters were placed in the water phantom . in the same run a counter on the beam axis and a ring of 2  cm in radius consisting of four tepcs",
    "were placed at 27.71  cm depth .",

    "it is expected that radiation fields far from the beam axis have a large contribution from neutrons produced in fragmentation of beam nuclei . therefore , before performing microdosimetry simulations with nuclear beams we checked the validity of the mchit model with respect to irradiation of the same tepc model by neutrons .",
    "the data obtained with quasi - monoenergetic neutron beams  @xcite were used for this purpose .",
    "energy spectra of neutrons used in the two sets of measurements  @xcite were modeled as superpositions of gaussian peaks centered at 40 and 65  mev , respectively , and broad plateaus .",
    "the ratios between the flux of neutrons with energies within the peak and the total neutron flux were set to 1:2.768 and 1:2.807 for 40 and 65 mev spectra , respectively , following the estimations by nakane et al .",
    "as proved by our simulations , the calculated @xmath21 distributions are not very sensitive to these ratios .",
    "for example , the calculations with these ratios set to 1:3.5 provide results similar to ones obtained with original ratios  @xcite . in the following the above - described spectra composed of peaks and plateaus",

    "neutrons were delivered to the phantom via a collimator of 10.9  cm in diameter , which was much larger than the diameter of the tepc . since neutrons traversed the tepc randomly at various impact parameters , the mean neutron path @xmath14 inside the tepc sensitive volume amounted to @xmath38 of its diameter .",
    "as explained in section  [ sec : basicsmicro ] , this corresponds to the standard conditions of microdosimetry measurements  @xcite .",

    "one can note a better agreement between the measured  @xcite @xmath21 distributions and mchit calculations as compared with the phits code used for modeling  @xcite the same tepc measurements  @xcite .",

    "this estimation is based on the assumption that the tepc is placed in a homogeneous radiation field and traversed by a single particle per event .",
    "this corresponds to the simplest standard event topology characterized by a single track with @xmath61 .",
    "this means that the particle traverses the tepc sensitive volume by a straight - line trajectory , it is not stopped inside the volume , and secondary particles are not produced neither in the volume nor in the vicinity of it .    in the experiment  @xcite the tepc",

    "we investigate the event topology relevant to the both cases . indeed , on the contrary to the measurements with neutron beams described in section  [ sec :",
    "neutron_measurements ] , the size of the @xmath0c beam was essentially smaller ( 3  mm fwhm ) compared to the diameter of the tepc sensitive volume ( @xmath62  mm ) . therefore , for a tepc placed on the beam axis at the plateau region of the depth - dose distribution and ,",
    "possibly , close to the bragg peak , the mean chord length will be larger than @xmath63 due to mostly central beam incidence .",

    "we investigate whether the irradiation conditions match the standard ones for which the mean chord length @xmath63 was used to calculate lineal energy @xmath7 for a single particle traversal .",
    "since a tepc detector is only sensitive to the total energy @xmath12 deposited to its volume given by the number of ionized atom - electron pairs produced in the gas chamber , the number of tracks in each event and their length ( event topology ) can not be identified in experiment .",

    "much more secondary electrons are produced close to the bragg peak , but they are generally less energetic compared to those at `` 0  cm , plateau '' and do not escape from the tepc .",

    "the tepcs located at 10  cm distance from the beam axis are hit exclusively by secondary particles ( mostly nucleons ) produced in nuclear fragmentation reactions .",

    "however , as seen from the corresponding panel of figure  [ fig : spectra_bicxqmd ] , mchit predicts a slightly sharper drop of @xmath21 at the right slope of the peak .",
    "this peak is due to energetic beam nuclei that traverse the tepc at the entrance to the phantom . as discussed in section  [ sec : topology ] , because of a relatively small beam diameter ( 3  mm fwhm ) compared to the tepc size , carbon nuclei propagate close to the diameter of the tepc .",

    "as seen in the panel `` 0  cm ,  peak '' , the peak in the @xmath21 distribution corresponding to @xmath0c nuclei becomes higher and broader as the tepc is moved to the stopping point of beam nuclei .",
    "compared to the `` 0  cm , plateau '' panel , here the peak is shifted to a much higher value of @xmath84  kev/@xmath27 m , and it has a prominent satellite peak with a maximum at @xmath85  kev/@xmath27 m .",
    "the positions of both peaks are well reproduced by simulations . the observed shift of the main peak to larger @xmath7 is due to increasing the let of beam nuclei as they are slowing down with their penetration in water .    a common feature of the `` 0  cm ,  plateau '' and `` 0  cm ,  peak '' distributions consists in the presence of additional peaks at lower @xmath7 values compared to the peaks of beam nuclei .",
    "such satellite peaks are present due to relatively heavy projectile fragments ( boron , beryllium and lithium nuclei ) propagating with velocities close to the velocity of beam nuclei . since their @xmath6 are smaller , their ionization energy loss is reduced accordingly .",
    "this leads to reduced let of secondary fragments compared to beam nuclei . while the satellite peak is accurately reproduced by theory at the entrance to the phantom at `` 0  cm ,  plateau '' , a similar peak at `` 0  cm ,  peak '' tepc position is underestimated .",
    "this indicates , that the yields of secondary fragments are underestimated by the nuclear fragmentation models used in mchit .",
    "the spectrum at the beam axis beyond the bragg peak ( `` 0  cm ,  tail '' ) and all the six spectra at 2 and 10  cm radii do not demonstrate any sharp peaks .",
    "this is because of contributions from various secondary light particles characterized by a broad range of kinetic energies and charges .",
    "it is expected that recoil charged particles produced in neutron - induced reactions also contribute to these spectra .",
    "this contribution is estimated below in section  [ sec : neutrons ] .",
    "while the general trends of the distributions measured at these seven points are reproduced by mchit , the absolute values are underestimated by a factor of two or slightly less . in view of a @xmath82 difference in magnitude between `` 0  cm ,  tail '' and `` 10  cm ,",

    "the energy imparted to each ring was calculated and then divided by the mass of the ring and by the number of beam particles . due to a finite size of the tepc , particles traverse it at various distances from the beam axis .",
