    "a billiard is a mechanical system in which a point particle moves in a compact container @xmath0 and bounces off its boundary @xmath1 .",
    "it preserves a uniform measure on its phase space , and the corresponding collision map ( generated by the collisions of the particle with @xmath1 , see below ) preserves a natural ( and often unique ) absolutely continuous measure on the collision space .",
    "the dynamical behavior of a billiard is determined by the shape of the boundary @xmath1 , and it may vary greatly from completely regular ( integrable ) to strongly chaotic .    in this paper",
    "we only consider planar billiards , where @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics in simple containers ( circles , ellipses , rectangles ) are completely integrable .",
    "the first class of chaotic billiards was introduced by ya .",
    "sinai in 1970 @xcite ; he proved that if @xmath1 is convex inward and there are no cusps on the boundary , then the dynamics is hyperbolic ( has no zero lyapunov exponents ) , ergodic , mixing and k - mixing .",
    "he called such systems _ dispersing billiards _ , now they are often called _",
    "sinai billiards_. gallavotti and ornstein @xcite proved in 1976 that sinai billiards are bernoulli systems .",
    "many other classes of planar chaotic billiards have been found by bunimovich @xcite in the 1970s , and by wojtkowski @xcite , markarian @xcite , donnay @xcite , and again bunimovich @xcite in the 1980s and early 1990s .",
    "all of them are proven to be hyperbolic , and some  ergodic , mixing , and bernoulli .",
    "multidimensional chaotic billiards are known as well , they include two classical models of mathematical physics ",
    "periodic lorentz gases and hard ball gases , for which strong ergodic properties have been established in a series of fundamental works within the last 20 years , we refer the reader to a recent collection of surveys @xcite .",
    "however , ergodic and mixing systems ( even bernoulli systems ) may have quite different statistical properties depending on the rate mixing ( the rate of the decay of correlations ) , whose precise definition is given below .",
    "on the one hand , the strongest chaotic systems  anosov diffeomorphisms and expanding interval maps  have exponential mixing rates , see a survey @xcite .",
    "this fact implies the central limit theorem , the convergence to a brownian motion in a proper space - time limit , and many other useful approximations by stochastic processes that play crucial roles in statistical mechanics .    on the other hand , many hyperbolic , ergodic and bernoulli systems have slow ( polynomial ) mixing rates , which cause weak statistical properties .",
    "even the central limit theorem may fail , see again a survey @xcite .",
    "such systems are , in a sense , _ intermittent _ , they exemplify a delicate transition from regular behavior to chaos . for this reason they have attracted considerable interest in mathematical physics community during the past 20 years .",
    "the rates of mixing in chaotic billiards is rather difficult to establish , though , because the dynamics has singularities , which aggravate the analysis and make standard approaches ( based on markov partitions and transfer operators ) inapplicable . for planar sinai billiards , l .- s .",
    "young @xcite developed in 1998 a novel method ( now known as _ young s tower construction _ ) to prove exponential ( fast ) mixing rates .",
    "young applied it to sinai billiards under two restrictions  no corner points on the boundary and finite horizon .",
    "her method was later extended to all planar sinai billiards @xcite and to more general billiard - like hamiltonian systems @xcite .",
    "there are no rigorous results on the decay of correlations for multidimensional chaotic billiards yet , since even the best methods can not handle a recently discovered phenomenon characteristic for billiards in dimension 3 and higher  the blow - up of the curvature of singularity manifolds @xcite .    for planar billiards with slow ( nonexponential ) mixing rates ,",
    "very little is known .",
    "they turned out to be even harder to treat than sinai billiards .",
    "most published accounts are based on numerical experiments and heuristic analysis , which suggest that sinai billiards with cusps on the boundary @xcite and bunimovich billiards @xcite have polynomial mixing rates .",
    "slow mixing in these models appears to be induced by tiny places in the phase space , where the motion is nearly regular , and where the moving particle can be caught and trapped for arbitrarily long times .",
    "a general approach to the studies of abstract hyperbolic systems with slow mixing rates was developed by young in 1998 @xcite , but its application to billiards required substantial extra effort , and it took five more years . only in 2004 r.",
    "markarian @xcite used young s method to establish polynomial mixing rates for one class of chaotic billiards  bunimovich stadia .",
    "he showed that the correlations for the corresponding collision map decayed as @xmath3 .    in this paper",
    "we generalize and simplify the method due to young and markarian essentially reducing it to one key estimate that needs to be verified for each chaotic billiard table .",
    "this estimate , see ( [ ss ] ) in section  [ secps ] , has explicit geometric meaning and can be checked by rather straightforward ( but sometimes lengthy ) computations , almost in an algorithm - like manner .",
    "we also remark that the method is not restricted to billiards , it is designed for general nonuniformly hyperbolic systems with sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measures .",
    "then we apply the above method to several classes of billiards .",
    "these include semi - dispersing billiards in rectangles with internal scatterers , bunimovich flower - like regions , and `` skewed '' stadia ( `` drive - belt '' tables ) . in each case",
    "we prove that the correlations decay as @xmath4 for a certain @xmath5 , which depends on the character of `` traps '' in the dynamics , and is different for different tables .",
    "we also show that for some billiard tables our key estimate fails , hence the correlation analysis requires further work .",
    "here we state our estimates on the decay of correlations for several classes of billiard systems . the general method for proving these estimates",
    "is described in the next two sections .",
    "first we recall standard definitions @xcite .",
    "a billiard is a dynamical system where a point moves freely at unit speed in a domain @xmath0 ( _ the table _ ) and reflects off its boundary @xmath1 ( _ the wall _ ) by the rule `` the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection '' .",
    "we assume that @xmath6 and @xmath1 is a finite union of @xmath7 curves ( arcs ) .",
    "the phase space of this system is a three dimensional manifold @xmath8 .",
    "the dynamics preserves a uniform measure on @xmath8 .",
    "let @xmath9 $ ] be the standard cross - section of the billiard dynamics , we call @xmath10 the _ collision space_. canonical coordinates on @xmath10 are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , where @xmath11 is the arc length parameter on @xmath1 and @xmath13 $ ] is the angle of reflection , see fig .  [ rp ] .     and @xmath12,height=144 ]",
    "the first return map @xmath14 is called the _ collision map _ or the _ billiard map _ , it preserves smooth measure @xmath15 on @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath16 be two functions .",
    "_ correlations _ are defined by _ n(f , g , , ) = _ ( f^n )",
    "g d- _ f d _ g d [ cn ] it is well known that @xmath17 is _ mixing _ if and only if [ cto0 ] _ n _ n(f , g , , ) = 0 f , gl^2 _ ( ) the rate of mixing of @xmath18 is characterized by the speed of convergence in ( [ cto0 ] ) for smooth enough functions @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "we will always assume that @xmath19 and @xmath20 are hlder continuous or piecewise hlder continuous with singularities that coincide with those of the map @xmath21 for some @xmath22 .",
    "for example , the free path between successive reflections is one such function .",
    "we say that correlations decay _ exponentially _ if @xmath23 for some @xmath24 and _ polynomially _ if @xmath25 for some @xmath5 . here",
    "the constant factor depends on @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "next we state our results .",
    "let @xmath26 be a rectangle and @xmath27 open strictly convex subdomains with smooth or piecewise smooth boundaries whose curvature is bounded away from zero and such that @xmath28 for @xmath29 , see fig .",
    "[ semi ] ( a ) .",
    "a billiard in @xmath30 is said to be _ semi - dispersing _ since its boundary is partially dispersing ( convex ) and partially neutral ( flat ) ; the flat part is @xmath31 .    for the above semi - dispersing billiard tables , the correlations ( [ cn ] ) for the billiard map @xmath17 and piecewise hlder continuous functions @xmath32 on @xmath10 decay as @xmath33 .

    "assume that every focusing component @xmath44 is an arc of a circle such that there are no points of @xmath1 on that circle or inside it , other than the arc @xmath44 itself , see fig .",
    "[ semi ] ( b ) .",
    "billiards of this type were introduced by bunimovich @xcite who established their hyperbolicity and ergodicity .",
    "we make two additional assumptions : ( i ) if two dispersing components @xmath45 have a common endpoint , then they are transversal to each other at that point ( no cusps ! ) ; ( ii ) every focusing arc @xmath46 is shorter than half a circle .",
    "we also assume that the billiard table is generic to avoid certain technical complications , see section  [ sectm2 ] .    for the above bunimovich - type billiard tables , the correlations ( [ cn ] ) for the billiard map @xmath17 and piecewise hlder continuous functions @xmath32 on @xmath10 decay as @xmath47 .",
    "in fact , the boundary @xmath1 may have flat components as long as there is an upper bound on the number of consecutive reflections off the flat components . for example , this is the case when @xmath1 has a single flat component or exactly two nonparallel flat components .",
    "then the above theorem remains valid .",
    "however , if the billiard particle can experience arbitrarily many consecutive collisions with flat boundaries , then , generally speaking , even the ergodicity can not be guaranteed , let alone mixing or decay of correlations .",
    "lastly , we consider a special case  a stadium .",
    "it is a convex domain @xmath0 bounded by two circular arcs and two straight lines tangent to the arcs at their common endpoints , see fig .",
    "[ semi ] ( c ) .",
    "we distinguish between a `` straight '' stadium , whose flat sides are parallel , see fig .",
    "[ semi ] ( c ) , and a `` skewed '' stadium , whose flat sides are not parallel , we call them _ drive - belt tables _ , see fig .  [ unstadium2 ] ( a ) . notice that drive - belt tables contain an arc longer than a half circle , so they do not satisfy the assumption ( ii ) of the previous theorem ( or the assumptions made by markarian in @xcite ) . again billiards of this type were introduced by bunimovich @xcite who established their hyperbolicity and ergodicity .    for both types of stadia , the correlations ( [ cn ] ) for the billiard map @xmath17 and piecewise hlder continuous functions @xmath32 on @xmath10 decay as @xmath48 .    the same bound on correlations for straight stadia",
    "is already obtained by markarian @xcite , but we include it here for the sake of completeness .",
    "here we present a general method for estimating correlations in nonuniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems .",
    "it is based on young s recent results @xcite and their extensions by markarian @xcite and one of us @xcite .",
    "let @xmath17 be a nonuniformly hyperbolic map acting on a riemannian manifold @xmath10 with or without boundary .",
    "we assume that @xmath18 preserves an ergodic sinai - ruelle - bowen ( srb ) measure @xmath49 , see @xcite for definitions and basic facts .",
    "young @xcite found sufficient conditions under which correlations for the map @xmath18 decay exponentially .",
    "we only sketch young s method here , skipping many technical details , in order to focus on the main condition , see ( [ yexp ] ) below .",
    "the key element of young s construction is a `` horseshoe '' @xmath50 ( a set with a hyperbolic structure , often called a rectangle ) . by iterating points @xmath51 under the map",
    "@xmath18 until they make proper returns to @xmath50 , see definitions in @xcite , young constructs a tower , @xmath52 , in which the rectangle @xmath50 constitutes the first level ( the base ) .",
    "the induced map @xmath53 on the tower @xmath52 moves every point one level up until it hits the ceiling upon which it falls onto the base @xmath50 .",
    "now , for @xmath54 , let @xmath55 denote the `` return time '' of the point @xmath34 to the base @xmath50 .",
    "the tower has infinitely many levels , hence @xmath56 is unbounded .",
    "young proves that if the probability of long returns is exponentially small , then correlations decay exponentially fast .",
    "precisely , if ( x :  r(x;,_0)>n ) const^nn1 [ yexp ] where @xmath57 is a constant , then @xmath58 for some @xmath24 .    therefore , if one wants to derive an exponential bound on correlations for a particular map , one needs to construct a `` horseshoe '' @xmath50 and verify the tail bound ( [ yexp ] ) .",
    "the latter involves all the iterates of the map @xmath18 . to simplify this verification one of us ( nc ) proposed @xcite sufficient conditions , which involve just one iterate of the map @xmath18 ( or one properly selected power @xmath59 , see the next section ) , that imply the tail bound ( [ yexp ] ) .",
    "those conditions do not require a construction of a horseshoe @xmath50 .",
    "we present those conditions fully in the next section .",
    "young later extended the results of @xcite to cover system with slow mixing rates .",
    "she proved @xcite that if ( x :  r(x;,_0)>n ) constn^-an1 [ ypol1 ] where @xmath5 is a constant , then correlations decay polynomially : |_n(f , g,,)|<constn^-a [ ypol2 ]    again , a direct verification of the polynomial tail bound ( [ ypol1 ] ) in specific systems involves all the iterations of the map @xmath18 , and thus might be difficult .",
    "there are no known simplifications , like the one mentioned above , that would reduce this problem to just one iterate of the map @xmath18 either .",
    "however , there is a roundabout way proposed by markarian @xcite which simplifies the analysis , even though it leads to a slightly less than optimal bound on correlations .",
    "we describe markarian s approach next .",
    "suppose one can localize places on the manifold @xmath10 where the dynamics fails to be strongly hyperbolic , and find a subset @xmath60 on which @xmath18 has a strong hyperbolic behavior .",
    "this means , precisely , that the first return map @xmath61 satisfies the conditions of young s paper @xcite ; in particular , there exists a horseshoe @xmath62 for which an exponential tail bound ( [ yexp ] ) holds for the return times under the map @xmath63 .",
    "now , of course , the verification of the bound ( [ yexp ] ) for the map @xmath63 can be done via the simplified conditions of @xcite .",
    "next , consider the return times to @xmath64 under the original map @xmath18 , i.e. r(x;,m)=\\{r1 :  ^r(x)m } [ r0 ] for @xmath65 .",
    "suppose they satisfy a polynomial tail bound ( x :  r(x;,m)>n ) constn^-an1 [ mpol1 ] where @xmath5 is a constant .",
    "equivalently , we may suppose that ( xm :  r(x;,m)>n ) constn^-a-1n1 [ mpol2 ] the equivalence of ( [ mpol1 ] ) and ( [ mpol2 ] ) is a simple fact , we omit its proof .",
    "tail bounds for the return times @xmath66 to @xmath64 are much easier to obtain , in many systems , than those for the return times @xmath67 to @xmath50 .",
    "the following theorem was essentially proved in @xcite , but we provide a proof here for completeness :    [ tmpolycorr ] let @xmath14 be a nonuniformly hyperbolic map .",
    "suppose @xmath68 is a subset such that the first return map @xmath69 satisfies the tail bound ( [ yexp ] ) for the return times @xmath70 to a rectangle @xmath62 .",
    "if the return times @xmath66 satisfy the polynomial bound ( [ mpol1 ] ) or , equivalently , ( [ mpol2 ] ) , then |_n(f , g,,)|<const ( n)^a+1 n^-a [ mpol3 ]    _ proof_. for every @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 denote @xmath73 and @xmath74 where @xmath75 is a constant to be chosen shortly . by ( [ yexp ] )",
    ", @xmath76 choosing @xmath77 large enough makes this bound less than const@xmath78 .    to bound @xmath79",
    "we note that points @xmath80 return to @xmath64 at most @xmath81 times during the first @xmath82 iterates of @xmath18 . in other words , there are @xmath83 time intervals between successive returns to @xmath64 , and hence the longest such interval , we call it @xmath84 , has length @xmath85 . applying the bound ( [ mpol2 ] ) to the interval @xmath84 gives @xmath86 ( the extra factor of @xmath82 must be included because the interval @xmath84 may appear anywhere within the longer interval @xmath87 $ ] , and the measure @xmath49 is invariant ) . in terms of young s tower @xmath52 ,",
    "we obtain ( x :  r(x;,_0)>n ) const(n)^a+1 n^-an1 [ ypol3 ] this tail bound differs from young s ( [ ypol1 ] ) by the extra factor @xmath88 .",
    "however , as it was explained by markarian @xcite , the same argument that young used to derive ( [ ypol2 ] ) from ( [ ypol1 ] ) now gives us ( [ mpol3 ] ) based on ( [ ypol3 ] ) .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem .",
    "here we list sufficient conditions on a 2d nonuniformly hyperbolic map @xmath89 with a mixing srb measure @xmath49 under which its correlations decay exponentially . these are a 2d version of more general conditions stated in @xcite .",
    "we also provide comments that will help us apply these conditions to chaotic billiards .",
