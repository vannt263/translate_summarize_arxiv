    "<S> we have measured neutron diffraction patterns in a single crystal sample of the pyrochlore compound er@xmath0ti@xmath0o@xmath1 in the antiferromagnetic phase ( t=0.3k ) , as a function of the magnetic field , up to 6 t , applied along the [ 110 ] direction . </S>",
    "<S> we determine all the characteristics of the magnetic structure throughout the quantum critical point at @xmath2=2 t . as a main result , </S>",
    "<S> all er moments align along the field at @xmath2 and their values reach a minimum . using a four - sublattice self - consistent calculation , </S>",
    "<S> we show that the evolution of the magnetic structure and the value of the critical field are rather well reproduced using the same anisotropic exchange tensor as that accounting for the local paramagnetic susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , an isotropic exchange tensor does not match the moment variations through the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> the model also accounts semi - quantitatively for other experimental data previously measured , such as the field dependence of the heat capacity , energy of the dispersionless inelastic modes and transition temperature . </S>"
