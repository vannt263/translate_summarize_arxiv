    "a process frequently encountered in the study of chemical and physical phenomena is the aggregation of small particles joining each other to form larger spatial structures and clusters .",
    "the comprehension of the general properties of aggregation processes constitutes a cross - disciplinary interest for pure and applied research @xcite with broad implications to engineering and industrial technology @xcite .",
    "aggregation is also a basic process in those biological systems where cooperation activity among individuals usually involves social behaviors .",
    "a well known example is _ animal grouping _ where an ensemble of individuals belonging to the same species live together into organized communities such as insect swarms , mammal herds , fish - schools , and bird flocks @xcite .",
    "the emergence of cooperation is still one of the most puzzling mechanism occurring in biology , mainly because social and altruistic behaviors are against evolutionary selection which , instead , promotes antagonism and competition .",
    "mathematical population biology @xcite and game theory @xcite have always attempted to reconcile altruism with evolutionary selection trying to establish rigorous and quantitative basis to the emergence of cooperation among individuals .",
    "one of the first approaches , known as _ kinship theory _ , has been elaborated by w.d .",
    "hamilton  @xcite .",
    "it is based on the principle of _ kin selection _ and allows altruism to arise among siblings provided they share enough common genes .",
    "although the hamilton s principle strictly works for related individuals , it has been also applied to cases of absence of kin recognition as a rather general explanation for altruism .",
    "alternatively , when genetic arguments can not be manifestly invoked because cooperation involves unrelated individuals , it is reasonable to resort to minimalist phenomenological models describing the mutual advantage to form a group or to make coordinated movements @xcite in terms of effective `` social '' interactions .",
    "synchronized and collective behaviors , on the other hand , are the result of `` short- '' and `` long - range '' interactions between different units which , in social biological systems , are not very dissimilar to those used in the description of fluids and condensed matter . in this perspective , it is reasonable to hope that some general features of collective behaviors of living organisms can be simulated and classified through the same principles of statistical mechanics successfully applied to understand the structural organization of the matter .",
    "general and simple theoretical descriptions of cooperation in social communities requires two principal ingredients : i ) the space of states , where each point represents the status of the individuals and ii ) the strategy , that is the rule according to which the individuals ( players ) decide to change their status in response to partial or complete information about the actions of the other players @xcite .",
    "the prevalence of cooperation is the outcome of those strategies rewarding altruistic acts and punishing defections .",
    "these rules should be given as simple and generic as possible in order to capture the essential and universal aspects of the problem without making the theoretical approach extremely complex or too computationally demanding .    in a previous work @xcite we studied a model suggested by sigmund and nowak @xcite to test the hypothesis of the emergence of cooperation by _ indirect reciprocity _",
    "among unrelated individuals . in their game",
    "theoretical approach , sigmund and nowak assumed that cooperation to work in evolved social systems requires the knowledge of `` reputation or status '' of their members ( players ) .",
    "thus a dynamical coordinate , @xmath0 , the _ image score _",
    ", is assigned to each player signaling his / her reputation or status to the group .",
    "@xmath0 is updated according to the altruistic or selfish acts made by players in the past and it is an information accessible to the whole community . at each turn of the game ,",
    "a randomly selected player with score @xmath0 assesses the possibility to provide help only to those opponents with a score greater than @xmath0 .",
    "the image score , thus , determines the selfish or altruistic strategy .",
    "altruism , despite the cost , is preferably since it increases @xmath0 that , conversely , is lowered by a defection . in this scheme",
    ", cooperation occurs thanks to the principle `` help and you will be helped '' .",
    "a simpler version of this problem was recast , in a recent paper @xcite , in terms of a non - linear fokker - planck equation for the population of individuals with a certain image score .",
    "the equation had a non - local drift term that characterized the strategy .",
    "the peers exert a sort of `` pressure '' on each other within a finite range of influence in order to uniform their image score to the majority .",
    "in this sense , the model produces an aggregation mechanism in the space of scores driven by a population gradient ; aggregated states correspond to situations where cooperation is achieved .",
    "the model , upon changing the system parameters , exhibited a transition from an aggregation behavior to a uniform state with no prevalence of selected image scoring .",
    "this model , in another context and with proper changes , can also be used to describe pattern formation and chemotaxis phenomena where diffusion competes with a drift induced by chemical or population gradients @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the dynamics of the aggregation process which was not considered in ref .  @xcite . to this aim",
    ", we employ a discrete , or individual based , variant of that model , where a set of individuals modify their status according to stochastic differential equations corresponding to a brownian motion with a drift induced by the spatial distribution of other walkers .",
    "this model can also be interpreted as a collection of interacting random walks @xcite where the path coalescence depends on the balance between the diffusion and the nonlocal drift .",
    "the particle - based modeling permits one to track the state and position of each component of the system .",
    "it is appropriate to study the fluctuations in this kind of aggregation dynamics characterized by the formation and merging of growing clusters .",
    "we shall see that , differently from previous proposed mechanisms , the coalescence of trajectories does not emerge as a result of direct interactions between particles @xcite or via reaction - diffusion mechanism @xcite , but rather it is the consequence of the drift term sensible to density fluctuations occurring even at distances relatively large .",
    "we found that in this model , aggregation and clustering follow the general scaling behavior of stochastic coalescence phenomena @xcite with power law for the kinetics of the number and average mass of clusters .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",

    "iii is devoted to the presentation and discussion of numerical results . finally , in sect .",

    "_ i.e. _ the range @xmath12 within which one individual still perceives the presence and the influence of the other members of the group ( @xmath13 ) .",

    ", @xmath15 is likely to point towards the most populated regions if not too far from the @xmath3-th player ; the evolution rule ( [ eq : evol1],[eq : evol2 ] ) , therefore , defines an aggregation process where individuals preferably migrate , advected by @xmath6 , towards the regions with higher local population .",
    "@xmath16 is the unitary step function .",
    "a random noise @xmath17 of zero average and correlation @xmath18 incorporates some degree of uncertainty or randomness in the dynamics of the system , introducing the possibility for the individuals to change even randomly their state . in a possible chemotaxis framework @xcite , the system ( [ eq : evol1],[eq : evol2 ] )",
    "represents the motion of biological organisms that , while performing a random walk with diffusion coefficient @xmath19 , secrete pheromones whose concentration turns to be proportional to the number of individuals at a given place .",
    "then , the organisms following the concentration gradient feel an attraction towards the nearest most crowded zones @xcite . the parameter @xmath20 sets the range of the velocity excursion ; the normalization factor @xmath21 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : evol2 ] ) makes the velocity bounded within @xmath22 $ ] implying that individuals have a limited response velocity as it happens in realistic cases .",
    "this maximal speed is reached when @xmath23 or @xmath24 , _",
    "i.e. _ when the whole population lies completely on the right / left with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath3-th individual , then , will move ballistically with the absolute maximal velocity @xmath25 to join the other @xmath26 members independently of @xmath1 .",
    "thus the drift @xmath27 is a nonextensive parameter defining the model .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : evol1 ] ) can be cast in a dimensionless form with the proper rescaling of time @xmath28 and space @xmath29 , where only one independent parameter survives . in the natural units ( @xmath30 ) ,",
    "the variance of the noise is renormalized to @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "hereafter therefore we work with the values @xmath30 .    in our study , we consider the effects of varying both the randomness and the density of individuals in order to see how they affects the kinetics of aggregation . for low noise levels ( @xmath32 )",
    "the system has a strong propensity to aggregation and almost independently of the initial conditions the particles form clusters that collapse each other to generate new larger clusters .",

    ", the process continues until only one cluster survives with a well defined size and particle distribution @xcite .",
    "however , in larger systems @xmath37 with random initial configuration , this final state is practically inaccessible to simulations because the transient regimes become extremely long . in this case",
    "the aggregation kinetics is the dominating and relevant feature of the system behavior .    for @xmath38 ,",
    "the dynamics of the system loses its tendency to cluster and particles basically perform a standard random walk inside the one - dimensional box containing them .",
    "this kind of non - equilibrium transition is clearly illustrated by figure  [ fig : transition ] where we plot the evolution of the number of clusters @xmath39 that are present in the system .",
    "we define a cluster as a set of particles with mutual distances @xmath40 below a given cutoff @xmath41 that we shall call resolution .",
    "we see that for noise below @xmath42 , @xmath39 fluctuates but exhibits a decreasing trend in time , signaling that clusters coalesce with each other so their average number decreases .     and different variance @xmath19 of the noise , indicated in the inset .",
    "the threshold @xmath42 separates aggregation from uniform distribution of particles.,width=302 ]    if @xmath43 , after a small transient , the number of cluster fluctuates around a stationary value .",
    "a similar behavior is observed in _ spreading _ experiments where the system evolves from a set of spatially localized initial conditions .",

    "this basically confirms the scenario already described for the number of clusters : when the dynamics is dominated by noise effects , the clusters become unstable and evaporate .     versus time in spreading experiments with @xmath47 particles at different noise level showing the crossover from localized to delocalized evolutions . each curve is the result of the average over @xmath48 independent runs . ]",

    "the larger clusters exhibits low coalescence rates and acts as coagulation centers by absorbing single particles or smaller clusters .    a first quantitative attempt to describe the aggregation kinetics can be made by the following argument that considers the very ideal case of only two clusters , approximated as flat particle distributions in the intervals @xmath85 $ ] around their centers of mass @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) .",

    "this means that systems with higher densities generate a smaller number of clusters that , due to the conservation of the number of particles , must contain a larger number of particles already in the first stages of their formation .",

    "later on , different densities reflect only in different prefactors of the power law ( [ eq : ncpow ] ) .",
