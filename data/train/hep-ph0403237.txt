    "in the standard model ( sm ) @xcite , the electromagnetic interactions of each of the three charged leptons are identical . however , there is no experimentally verified explanation for the existence of three generations of leptons nor for why they have such different masses",
    ". new insight might be forthcoming if the leptons were observed to have a substructure which could manifest itself in deviations from the sm values for the anomalous magnetic or electric dipole moments .",
    "the anomalous moments for the electron and muon have been measured with very high precision @xcite compared to those of tau for which there are only upper limits @xcite .    in general , a photon may couple to a tau through its electric charge , magnetic dipole moment or electric dipole moment .",
    "this coupling may be parametrised using a matrix element in which the usual @xmath4 is replaced by a more general lorentz - invariant form    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the mass of the @xmath0 lepton and @xmath7 is the momentum transfer .",
    "the @xmath8-dependent form - factors , @xmath9 , have familiar interpretations for @xmath10 : @xmath11 is the electric charge ; @xmath12 is the anomalous magnetic moment ; and @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the electric dipole moment .",
    "the analysis of radiative @xmath0 pair production provides a means to determine the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the @xmath0 lepton at @xmath10 .",
    "an anomalous magnetic dipole moment at @xmath10 ( @xmath15 ) or an electric dipole moment ( @xmath16 ) affects the total cross section for the process @xmath1 as well as the shape of energy and angular distributions of the three final state particles @xcite .",
    "previous experimental limits @xcite on @xmath15 and @xmath16 have been based on approximate calculations of the @xmath1 cross section and photon energy distribution .    the first direct determination of the anomalous magnetic moment of the @xmath0 lepton , _",
    "i.e. _ of @xmath15 , is due to grifols and mndez using l3 data @xcite .",
    "they derived a limit for @xmath17 and @xmath18 cm at @xmath10 .",

    "our aim in this paper is to analyze the reaction @xmath1 .",

    "the analysis is carried out in the context of a left - right symmetric model @xcite and we attribute a magnetic moment and an electric dipole moment to the tau lepton .",

    "we take advantage of this fact to set limits for @xmath24 and @xmath14 for different values of the mixing angle @xmath3 @xcite , which is consistent with other constraints previously reported @xcite .",
    "we do our analysis on the @xmath2 peak ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "our results are therefore independent of the mass of the additional heavy @xmath26 gauge boson which appears in these kind of models .",
