    "the existence of a correlation between the position of supernova remnants ( snrs ) and that of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) is supported by theoretical arguments and observational evidences .",
    "infrared observations confirmed the theoretical expectation that stars , especially massive ones , form mainly in the womb of gms . having a relatively short timelife",
    ", massive stars can complete their evolution and explode within the parent gmc before this is swept - out by stellar winds .",
    "sn explosions within , or in the nearby of , gmcs may trigger the formation of new stars explaining the bursting star formation activity observed in several dense regions of the galaxy , e.g. in the orion giant cloud , and in starburst galaxies .    from the point of view of high energy astrophysics , snrs interacting with mcs",
    "are very interesting systems . since sn explosions are expected to be the main source of the bulk of cosmic rays ( crs ) in the interstellar medium ( ism ) @xcite , a mc which is embedding , or just lay in the nearby of , an active snr , should be crossed by a flux of relativistic particles which is significantly larger than in the rest of the galaxy .",
    "furthermore , due to their relatively high gas density ( @xmath8 ) , gmcs should act as efficient astrophysical beam - dumps converting a relevant fraction of the primary particle energy into secondary @xmath0-ray and neutrino emissions ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in the following",
    "we will generally call snrs interacting with mcs as _ embedded snrs _ , also in those cases in which the snr is not completely surrounded by the molecular gas .",
    "evidences of a correlation between @xmath0-ray emission and dense molecular gas have been found by several satellites and particularly by egret ( see @xcite ) and have been extensively studied by many authors ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "those observations , however , may generally be explained without invoking any local excess in the cr energy density respect to the value observed on the earth . only recently ,",
    "a new generation of atmospheric cherenkov telescopes , especially hess , were able to find the smoking - gun of the interaction of crs accelerated by an active snr with a close mc .",
    "the most interesting hess observations in this respect are those of rxj1713.7 - 3946 @xcite and the very recent measurements of the galactic centre ( gc ) ridge emission @xcite .",
    "several arguments suggest that the origin of the very high energy ( he ) radiation coming from these sources may be hadronic .",
    "one of the most solid among these arguments is based on the observation of strong ( up to several milligauss ) magnetic fields in mcs @xcite ( see @xcite for the gc region ) .",
    "such strong field should give rise to dramatic electron synchrotron energy losses above the tev suppressing a possible he inverse compton contribution to the total @xmath0-ray emission from those regions ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "although the previous argument is rather convincing , a more direct evidence that he @xmath0-rays from embedded snrs are produced by @xmath9 decay would be extremely precious to confirm the validity of the entire scenario . such an evidence may come from the detection of neutrinos coming from the same sources .",
    "several neutrino telescopes are already operating , or under construction , around the world ( see e.g. @xcite ) . due to their large detection volume and observation time",
    ", these instruments may have the capability to detect at least few neutrinos from some snrs , especially if they are embedded in a dense medium .",
    "it is important to observe that the energy threshold above which neutrino telescopes may identify astrophysical neutrino sources ( @xmath10 ) is approximatively the same above which atmospheric cherenkov telescopes can detect photons .",
    "this coincidence offers the interesting possibility to directly test if he photons and neutrinos have the same hadronic origin confirming the half - century pending hypothesis that hecrs are accelerated by snrs . having that purpose in mind , in this paper we estimate the expected neutrino / photon flux ratio in the tev energy range from embedded snrs .",
    "our computation of the @xmath11 ratio from pion decay is similar to that followed by the authors of @xcite for rxj1713 - 3946 ( see also @xcite ) and confirm their main results , a part small differences which we discuss in sec.[sec : nupion ] .    in sec.[antinu ]",
    "we discuss the production of tev antineutrinos by neutron decay in gmc complexes . in @xcite",
    "it was proposed that this process may give rise to a detectable antineutrino flux from the cyg ob2 association and from the gc .",
    "that analysis was based on ultra high energy cr anisotropy measurements which , however , have a very low statistical significance or , in the case of the gc , have not been confirmed by other experiments . we will show that unless the primary particle spectrum is considerably different from that expected from ordinary shock acceleration , an observable contribution of neutron decay to the total neutrino flux can hardly be expected . finally , in sec.[sec :",
    "nugc ] we apply the results of sec.[sec : nupion ] to estimate the muon neutrino flux from the mc complex in the gc on the basis of the new hess measurements @xcite .",
    "the process under consideration is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the pion multiplicity and @xmath15 is either a proton or a neutron .",
    "the general expression of the photon emissivity is @xmath16 where we assumed that hydrogen , having density @xmath17 , is the main proton target .",
    "when the proton energy is much larger than the proton mass , i.e. @xmath18 , the differential pion production cross section is well approximated by a scaling expression @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 . using the numerical package pythia @xcite we verified that the expression of the scaling function adopted by the authors of @xcite , @xmath22 , provides a good fit of simulated @xmath23 scattering data up to @xmath24 .    in all cases",
    "in which the proton spectrum is well approximated by a power spectrum @xmath25 the @xmath9 emissivity becomes @xmath26 where @xmath27 hence the photon emissivity is @xmath28 where we used @xmath29 .",
    "it is also useful to write the mean value of the ratio between photon energy and that of the parent proton ( _ photon elasticity _ ) , which is @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the angle of the photon momentum in the lab frame respect to that of the primary proton .",
    "we conclude this section by observing that by writing the proton spectrum in the form eq .",
    "( [ p_spectrum ] ) , we implicitly assumed that the ultra - violet cut - off is well above the maximal energy relevant for @xmath0-ray observations .",
    "this is well motivated by the fact that the energy spectra observed by hess for rxj1713.7 - 3946 @xcite and the gc @xcite , which we assume to be representative of all embedded snrs , are steady power laws up to @xmath32 .",
    "inelastic @xmath23 collisions lead to roughly the same number of @xmath9 s , @xmath33 s and @xmath34 s . if , as we are assuming here , @xmath9 decay is the dominant source of high energy photons , a comparable emission of @xmath35 and @xmath36 has to be expected .",
    "the emissivity of muon neutrinos and antineutrinos produced by direct @xmath33 and @xmath34decay is @xmath37 where @xmath38 , @xmath39 being the asymmetry between the positive and negative pions effectively produced in @xmath23 collisions : @xmath40 for @xmath41 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "since we do nt know the details of the interaction , the parameter @xmath39 can not be evaluated analytically and we have to recourse to numerical simulations .",
    "we performed a simulation of proton - proton interactions up to an incident energy of about 500 tev with pythia @xcite .",
    "our best fit for @xmath39 is @xmath44 with @xmath45 and @xmath46 . in fig.[fig : epsilon ] we show the energy dependence of our @xmath39 as well as our best fit .",
    ", as provided by pythia . ]    we can now write @xmath47 where @xmath48 represents the average of @xmath39 over the relevant energy range which , in our case , is @xmath49 .",
    "the computation of the contribution of secondary muon decay @xmath50 to the neutrino emissivity is slightly more involved .",
    "the contribution of this process to the neutrino emissivity is @xmath51 where from the kinematics it follows @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be safely posed to @xmath54 if the muon spectrum is broad enough .",
    "the muon emissivity is @xmath55 the neutrino emissivity can thus be estimated as done in @xcite by using the spectrum - weighted momenta @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are given in the same textbook for the different flavours .",
    "the total neutrino emissivity by both positive and negative pion decay is given by the sum of ( [ q_nu_pi ] ) and of ( [ q_mu_2 ] ) .",
    "we can account for kaons contribution as well , provided that we can relate their flux to that of pions .",
    "again , a simulation performed with the help of pythia allows us to determine that the mean ratio @xmath59 is about few percent .",
    "thus , accounting for the well known branching ratio for the decay @xmath60 , that is 63.5% , and keeping in mind that no significant dynamical differences arise between pions and kaons , we found the correction to the neutrino emissivity due to pion .",
    "this come out to be few percent .",
    "finally , using the expressions for the spectrum - weighted momenta and a mean asymmetry @xmath39 of about 5% we find the values of the ratios @xmath61 which we shown in tab.[tab : ratios ] for several values of the spectral index @xmath62 .",
    ".ratio between neutrino and @xmath0-ray emissivities for several values of the primary proton spectral index @xmath62 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     it is now straightforward to derive the total expected muon neutrino flux which is @xmath63 this flux is about the double of that estimated in @xcite using only the 2004 hess data @xcite . since the detection of secondary up - going muons produced by neutrino interaction in the earth is the most promising strategy to identify tev neutrino from astrophysical sources , neutrino telescopes in the north hemisphere are best suited to look for a signal from the gc as it is located in the southern sagittarius constellation . using the @xmath64 flux given in ( [ flux_nugc ] ) , and the antares effective area for up - going @xmath35s given in @xcite , we estimated the expected detection rate by this experiment to be @xmath65 which is , unfortunately , quite small . a @xmath66 neutrino telescope to be built in the mediterranean sea ( e.g. nemo @xcite or nestor @xcite upgrading ) has better chance to get a positive detection . indeed ,",
    "since the effective area of such an instrument should be at least 20 times better than that of antares , the expected rate is @xmath67 . as the expected background rate of such device is @xmath68 .",
    "@xcite , the observation time required to detect that source at 95%c.l is about three years .",
    "in this paper we estimated the neutrino / photon flux ratio in the tev energy range from _ embedded snrs_. we did that under the hypothesis that snrs shock accelerate protons and composite nuclei with a power law energy spectrum at least up to the pev . by assuming that all @xmath0-rays of that energy are produced by @xmath9 decay , we first computed the relative emissivities of muon and electron neutrinos produced by charged pion decay . then , we took into account for vacuum oscillations to determine the @xmath69 flux ratio to be expected on the earth for all lepton families .",
    "our results are similar , though not coincident , to those previously derived by other authors @xcite .",
    "we also considered the possible contribution that neutron decay may give to the tev antineutrino flux from a gmc embedding an active snr . using the results which we derived in a previous work @xcite",
    ", we showed that in dense molecular complexes ( e.g. in the gc ) hadronic scattering should be the dominant neutron production mechanism at the relevant energies ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "that channel was not considered in @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , we found that , although such a neutrino production channel is less severely constrained by @xmath0-ray observations , it is quite unlikely that under reasonable assumptions it could add a significant contribution to the total neutrino flux from such kind of sources .    as an application of our results we used the recently released data of the gc observation campaign by the hess collaboration @xcite to estimate the muon neutrino flux from that region .",
    "we found that the @xmath66 neutrino telescope to be built in mediterranean sea may have some chances to detect that source .",
    "although the expected neutrino detection rate is rather small , the possible observation of a positional coincidence between the @xmath0-ray and the neutrino source as well as the measurement of a flux ratio at the level estimated in this paper , would add significant evidence in favour of the hypothesis that hadron acceleration is taking place in that region .",
    "furthermore , since embedded snrs should be quite common objects in the galaxy and vhe @xmath0-ray and neutrino astronomy have just started , other sources of that kind may be discovered in both channels in a not too far future .",
