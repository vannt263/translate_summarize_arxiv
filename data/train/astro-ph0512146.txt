    "the quantitative interpretation of the hydrogen line spectrum is one of the foundations of modern astrophysics . being the most abundant and most basic element in the universe hydrogen imprints its signature on the spectra of stars , nebulae and accretion phenomena . for decades",
    "the focus laid in the modelling of the first members of the balmer series for deriving the physical properties of astronomical objects . in the meantime developments in instrumentation have opened the ir window to routine observation , which will even gain in importance in the future , with crires and visir on the vlt being important cornerstone projects .",
    "the next generation of ground - based large telescopes and the next large space telescope will focus on this wavelength range , primarily to study the high-@xmath2 universe .",
    "but it will also allow to investigate local objects in otherwise inaccessible environments , e.g. ultra - compact hii regions , the galactic centre and dust - enshrouded nearby starburst galaxies .",
    "the brackett and pfund lines are among the key diagnostics at these wavelengths . here",
    "we report on the findings of our reinvestigation of the non - lte line - formation problem for hydrogen  @xcite .",
    "we confront hi model atoms of different degree of sophistication with observations of early - type stars in order to derive a set of reference data which is , of course , of much broader interest than for stellar analyses alone .",
    "the line - formation computations are carried out using two methods . for main sequence stars of spectral types later than o and ba - type supergiants a hybrid approach is chosen .",
    "based on hydrostatic , plane - parallel , line - blanketed lte models calculated with the atlas9 code  @xcite the non - lte computations are performed using updated versions of detail and surface  @xcite . for the modelling of early b and o - type stars we use the non - lte model - atmosphere/ line - formation code fastwind  @xcite which accounts for spherical extension and hydrodynamic mass - outflow .",
    "it has been recently updated to include an approximate treatment of non - lte line - blocking / blanketing  @xcite .",
    "several model atoms for hi have been implemented .",
    "the two - body nature of the hydrogen atom allows the radiative data to be obtained analytically .",
    "on the other hand , excitation ( and ionization ) processes involving a colliding particle require a numerical solution of the resulting three - body coulomb problem .",
    "non - lte computations had to rely on approximation formulae @xcite ( mha , j72 ) for determining collisional excitation rates until recently , as only few measured cross - sections are available . using data from extensive _ ab - initio _ calculations up to @xmath0@xmath17  @xcite ( b04 ) we realise a third model atom , further improved by application of the approximation formula of  @xcite ( pr ) for determining electron - collision excitation rates for the remaining transitions with @xmath0,@xmath3@xmath45 .",
    "a comparison of electron collision strengths in fig .",
    "[ przybillaf1 ] shows good agreement of the mha and j72 approximations with the results of the detailed computation for the 12 transition .",
    "however , for transitions among levels with higher @xmath0 , like 56 , large differences can occur , which ultimately will manifest themselves in model spectra via their impact on the rate equations and thus the level populations .",
    "line broadening is accounted for by using the tables of  @xcite . in the case of the brackett and pfund lines",
    "we apply the theory of  @xcite .",
    "the mechanisms driving departures of hi from detailed balance in stellar atmospheres have been well understood since the seminal work of  @xcite ( for early - type stars ) , and numerous subsequent contributions  for line formation in the ir e.g. by  @xcite .",
    "the issue here is to study the impact of the _ local _ processes that affect the radiatively induced departures from lte , namely collisional interactions , which are assumed to be of secondary importance .",
    "indeed , the actual choice of such data produces no significant differences in the stellar continuum or the balmer line profiles .",
    "however , consider fig .",
    "[ przybillaf2 ] where the results from our model calculations for prominent ir lines in vega are shown .",
    "apparently , the choice of collisional data is not a second - order effect , but a dominant factor for line - formation computations in the ir . in the following we want to discuss the theoretical background of this behaviour .     and",

    "[ przybillaf3 ] .",
    "the overall behaviour , i.e. the over- and underpopulation of the levels of hi and of hii , is governed by the radiative processes , while the differences in the collisional data lead to modulations .",
    "these are small for the ground state and become only slightly more pronounced for the @xmath0@xmath122 level , as these are separated by comparatively large energy gaps from the remainder of the term structure . only colliding particles in the high - velocity tail of the maxwellian velocity - distribution",
    "are able to overcome these energy differences at the temperatures encountered in the star s atmosphere .",
    "however , line - formation computations in the ir will be affected , as maximum effects from variations of the collisional data are found for the levels with intermediate @xmath0 at line - formation depth .",
    "the line source function @xmath7 is particularly sensitive to variations of the ratio of departure coefficients @xmath13 when @xmath14 is small .",
