    "two mechanisms , random mutation and natural selection , are considered in the mutation - selection model to explain an evolutionary process . the mutation - selection model is generally classified into two types , the coupled model and the decoupled model , depending on the mutation mechanism considered .",
    "the coupled model considers mutations that are only allowed as replication errors during reproduction events .",
    "the decoupled model considers mutations that are allowed at any time during the life cycle , such as those due to the effects of radiation , free radicals or thermal fluctuations@xcite .",
    "hence , mutation and selection are assumed to be independent processes that occur in parallel .    from a biological point of view , the relative contributions of the underlying mutation mechanisms for the two versions of the mutation - selection model are controversial .",
    "a mutation mechanism described by the coupled version implies a relatively constant mutation rate per generation , whereas the mutation mechanism described by the decoupled version implies a relatively constant mutation rate in time . crow and kimura@xcite and",
    "akin@xcite studied the decoupled mutation - selection model .",
    "et al . _ reported that the decoupled mutation - selection model was equivalent to an ising quantum spin and calculated the observable quantities in three fitness landscapes using the methods from statistical mechanics@xcite . recently ,",
    "et al._@xcite and park and deem@xcite examined the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection model using a functional integral representation .",
    "several studies have considered the evolutionary process transiting to a neighboring higher fitness peak through the low - fitness valley .",
    "iwasa et al .",
    "calculated the rate of stochastic tunneling in a large population when the intermediate mutant had a lower fitness than the wild type , but the second mutant was beneficial@xcite .",
    "weissman et al . provided a complete description of the rate at which an asexual population traversed a specific path through a genotype space to a particular fitter genotype by neglecting backward mutations and genetic diversity@xcite .",
    "biological examples of the low - fitness valley can be found in pathogens that escape the immune response of their hosts , such as escherichia coli@xcite , salmonella typhimurium@xcite and the human immunodeficiency virus@xcite .",
    "another example might be the types of cancer that occur only after a series of mutations@xcite .",
    "previous studies calculated the crossing time and the growing probability in the coupled discrete - time mutation - selection model by switching on an asymmetric sharply - peaked landscape , such that the reversal allele of the optimal allele had higher fitness than the optimal allele , from an initial steady state in a sharply - peaked landscape@xcite .",
    "the growing probability was defined as the probability that additional offspring with the reversal allele grow to a measuring criterion .",
    "the present study calculated the growing probability in the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection model , which was evaluated as the ratio of the first arrival time to the final arrival time .",
    "the first arrival time was defined as the time when the first additional offspring arrived at the reversal allele .",
    "the final arrival time was defined as the arrival time of a successful offspring with the reversal allele that could grow to a measuring criterion .",
    "the growing probability of additional offspring with the reversal allele in the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection model was calculated systematically using computer simulations for various population sizes , sequence lengths , selective advantages , fitness parameters , and measuring parameters , and was compared with the theoretical formula for the growing probability in the moran two - allele model@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : section ii briefly describes the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection models and the computer simulation method .",
    "section iii presents the computer simulation results for the growing probability in the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection models .",
    "section iv summarizes the results .",
    "this study considered the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection model in a self - reproducing haploid population of @xmath0 individuals , whose size remains constant over the generations .",
    "the multiple alleles , @xmath11 , might be represented by a string of @xmath1 spins , which use two values , @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the time dependence of the number , @xmath14 , of individuals with the allele , @xmath11 , in the decoupled continuous - time mutation - selection model can be described by the following equation : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the fitness of the allele @xmath11 , and @xmath17 is the mean fitness of the population . in eq .",
    "( [ eq-1 ] ) , the mutation matrix , @xmath18 , which gives the mutation rate from @xmath19 to @xmath11 , excludes double mutations@xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the mutation rate per sequence element per unit time , and @xmath22 denotes the hamming distance between @xmath11 and @xmath19 .",
    "consider a sharply - peaked landscape such that the optimal allele @xmath23 has a maximum fitness 1 , and the remaining alleles have a lower fitness , @xmath24 .",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is called the fitness parameter .",
    "equation ( [ eq-1 ] ) was solved using a computer simulation with the assumption that all individuals had the optimal allele initially .",
    "the population then approached a stochastic steady state , which is a quasispecies near the optimal allele in a sharply - peaked landscape . after arriving at a stochastic steady state ,",
    "the sharply - peaked landscape was changed suddenly to the following asymmetric sharply - peaked landscape : @xmath25 where the maximum fitness was assigned to the reversal allele , @xmath26 , and the fitness of the remaining alleles was unchanged .",
    "all other parameters were fixed in this procedure , and the parameter , @xmath2 , in eq .",
    "( [ eq-3 ] ) is called the selective advantage of the reversal allele over the optimal allele .",
    "the reversal allele had higher fitness than the optimal allele , assuming that the selective advantage , @xmath2 , is a positive value .",
    "the asymmetric sharply - peaked landscape had two fitness peaks that were separated by a low - fitness valley with a tunable depth and width .",
    "the numbers , @xmath14 , were grouped into @xmath27 distinct classes according to their hamming distances from the optimal allele , @xmath28 , to improve the speed of the computer simulation@xcite .",
    "the number , @xmath29 , of individuals in class @xmath30 was defined by the sum of all numbers @xmath14 with a hamming distance , @xmath31 , from the optimal allele .",
    "the kinetic equation , eq . ( [ eq-1 ] ) , for the decoupled model can be expressed using the newly defined @xmath32 as follows : @xmath33 @xmath34 where @xmath35 gives the mutation rate from class @xmath36 to class @xmath30 .",
    "the relative density , @xmath37 , of class @xmath30 was then calculated by dividing the number , @xmath32 , by the population size .",
    "the computer simulations used the logistic branching process with the replacement of @xmath38 in eq .",
    "( [ eq-4 ] ) by @xmath39@xcite .",
    "the simulated population was evolved using the time steps of @xmath40 generations in this study .",
    "the mean fitness , @xmath41 , of the population was calculated at the beginning of each time step .",
    "the branching process assumes that the population in the next time step is determined by the following two events : each individual in a class can mutate into any class with a certain probability , and each individual in a class can produce an offspring in the same class with a certain probability . more details of the simulation for a finite population can be found in refs .",
    "19 and 24 .",
    "the time was set to @xmath42 when the fitness landscape changed suddenly to an asymmetric sharply - peaked landscape .",
    "the increase in the relative density @xmath43 was calculated .",
    "the computer simulation was completed when the increase in relative density with the reversal allele , @xmath44 , achieved the measuring criterion @xmath45 .",

    "the computer simulation recorded all arrival times , @xmath46 , satisfying two conditions , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the first arrival time , @xmath49 , was defined as the earliest among the recorded arrival times , and the final arrival time was defined as the latest after the computer simulation is complete .",
    "therefore , the final arrival time means the arrival time of a successful offspring with the reversal allele that can grow to a size , @xmath50 .",
    "the growing probability of additional offspring with the reversal allele was evaluated as the ratio of the first arrival time to the final arrival time , assuming that the additional offspring with the reversal allele are supplied at average time intervals of @xmath49 by stochastic fluctuations .",
    "this assumption holds well in the stochastic region , where the arrival of additional offspring with the reversal allele is a rare event with a quite long interval .",
    "fortunately , the main consequence of this study was obtained from the simulation results for the growing probability in the stochastic region .",
    "the computer simulation results for the growing probability were obtained by averaging @xmath51 independent runs . the mean and",
    "the standard error were calculated from @xmath51 data values transformed into a logarithmic scale because the data showed a gaussian distribution on a logarithmic scale .",
