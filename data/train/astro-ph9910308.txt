    "combining non - linear perturbation theory with the edgeworth expansion has largely succeeded in describing the gravitational evolution of the large - scale density pdf in the weakly non - linear regime , for gaussian initial conditions ( juszkiewicz et al 1995 , bernardeau & koffman 1995 ) . in principle , the accuracy of this approach is only limited by the order of the ( reduced ) cumulants , @xmath1 , involved in the edgeworth expansion . however , the edgeworth series yields a pdf that is ill - defined .",
    "it has negative probability values and assigns non - zero probability to negative densities ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "alternatively , we shall introduce the gamma pdf as the basis for an expansion in orthogonal ( laguerre ) polynomials around an arbitrary exponential tail ( see gaztaaga , fosalba & elizalde 1999 ) .",
    "the proposed gamma expansion is better suited for describing a realistic pdf , as always yields positive densities and the pdf is effectively positive - definite .",
    "= 7.truecm = 7.truecm    figure [ pdfra08 ] shows a comparison of the edgeworth and gamma expansions with n - body simulations .",
    "we measure the pdf in 10 realizations of scdm , @xmath3 and @xmath4 , with @xmath5 and @xmath6 particles and @xmath7 ( croft & efstathiou 1994 ) . we find that , up to second order , _ both expansions produce very similar results , specially around the peak of the distribution _ , within the error bars .",
    "however , _ the gamma expansion provides a better match to the pdf on the tails_. in particular , the gamma expansion is in far better agreement with the numerical results for negative values of @xmath8 ( see left panel ) and performs slightly better for the positive tail of the pdf , @xmath9 ( see right panel ) .    in summary ,",
    "we propose the gamma expansion as a useful alternative to the edgeworth series to model the gravitational evolution of the large - scale density pdf in the weakly non - linear regime . we stress the potential application of the gamma expansion for modeling other non - gaussian pdfs , such as those describing the peculiar velocities of galaxies or the temperature anisotropy of the cmb on small scales .",

    "<S> the gravitational evolution of the cosmic one - point probability distribution function ( pdf ) can be estimated using an analytic approximation that combines gravitational perturbation theory ( pt ) with the edgeworth expansion around a gaussian pdf . </S>",
