    "the motivation to study tetraquarks ( also called dimesons ) comes from our curiosity whether or not we can extrapolate our understanding of mesons and baryons ( in terms of quark models ) to two - hadron systems .",
    "dimesons are simpler than dibaryons ( or nuclear forces ) since they represent a four - body rather than a six - body system .",
    "heavy dimesons are cleaner than light ones since nonrelativistic parameterization and treatment are more justified and since they are likely to be longlived . therefore in this paper",
    "we study double heavy tetraquarks as prototypes . in our extrapolation from mesons and baryons to tetraquarks",
    "we assume the `` @xmath2 '' type of colour dependence of the interaction .",
    "it seems to work properly when going from mesons to baryons .",
    "it is a challenge to use tetraquarks as a test whether or not this assumption is valid also for larger systems .",
    "however , the question arises whether or not there is a signature of tetraquarks ( dimesons ) which could clearly distinguish their decay from the decay of two independent mesons .",
    "consider the analogy .",
    "the mass of the neutron is 1.3 mev larger than the mass of the proton , making the neutron unstable against the weak interaction and results in the @xmath3 decay .",
    "but when the neutron is bound in the deuteron with a binding energy of -2.23 mev , the decay is kinematically forbidden and the neutron becomes stable . if we replace the two baryons in the deuteron with two mesons we obtain the dimeson .",
    "when one of the mesons is a vector meson , its dominant decay mode in the case of weak binding would be the radiative decay @xmath4 , or in the system of the @xmath5 mesons @xmath6 , as well as the strong decay @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8 dimeson , however , is probably bound strongly enough so that radiative decay becomes energetically forbidden @xcite and it can decay only weakly .",
    "the binding of the @xmath9 dimeson is expected to be much weaker , but it might still be stable against strong interaction so as to decay only electromagnetically , or , at least , the strong decay might be considerably suppressed .",
    "the dramatic change of the decay modes and lifetime of vector mesons can serve as a tool for detecting tetraquarks with nonzero total spin .",
    "this effect would be very helpful in situations where the binding energy is small compared to experimental errors so that the detection of the tetraquark from the invariant mass of final particles could not distinguish between events where the two initial mesons were either free or weakly bound before the decay .",
    "in this study we consider tetraquarks made up of the same type of mesons , namely @xmath0 and @xmath10 tetraquarks with quantum numbers @xmath11 , since they are the best candidates for binding with respect to the @xmath0 ( @xmath10 ) threshold , as was already noted previously @xcite .",
    "such states can not decay strongly or electromagnetically into two @xmath12 or two @xmath5 mesons in the s wave due to angular momentum conservation nor in the p wave due to parity conservation .",
    "there are two extreme spatial configurations of quarks in a tetraquark .",
    "the first configuration which we call _ atomic _ is similar to @xmath13 , with a compact @xmath14 diquark instead of @xmath15 , around which the light antiquarks are in a similar state as in the @xmath16 baryon .",
    "the stability of the double heavy tetraquarks with this structure was first investigated by lipkin @xcite . the second configuration which we call _",
    "molecular _ is deuteron - like , where two heavy quarks are well separated and the light antiquarks are bound to them similarly as in the case of free mesons .",
    "this configuration is more likely to appear in weakly bound systems and was studied by manohar and wise @xcite and trnqvist @xcite in the framework of the pion exchange between two heavy mesons .",
    "it has been shown that nonrelativistic potential models in general give rise to _ atomic _ structure for the @xmath10 tetraquark @xcite , due to the large quark mass asymmetry .",
    "we use the @xmath10 system as a benchmark against which we compare other tetraquarks .    in sect .",
    "2 we repeat calculations of the @xmath10 tetraquark with the bhaduri potential @xcite and also with the al1 potential @xcite which due to the additional mass - dependent smearing of the spin - spin interaction gives a better description of meson spectroscopy .",
    "we then present results for the @xmath0 tetraquark , which is on the verge of being either bound or a resonant state , depending on the effective potential used in the calculations .",
    "we show that its structure is _ molecular _ , but with the introduction of the three - body force ( sect .",
    "3 ) it can become _",
    "atomic_. the fact that this system is so close to the @xmath17 threshold makes it very sensitive to the details of the effective interaction and therefore a promising candidate for studying the nature of the effective interaction between constituent quarks in nonrelativistic potential models .",
    "the estimated production rate is not high but tolerable . due to the strong influence of weak binding on the decay channels",
    ", it presents a very interesting experimental situation ( sect .",
    "the general idea of possible stable heavy tetraquarks has been first suggested by jaffe @xcite .",
    "it soon became clear that the systems with unequal masses of the quarks and the antiquarks are more promising , since the binding energy strongly depend on the mass ratio @xcite .",
    "the @xmath18 mass ratio is shown to be large enough to make @xmath19 stable , while the @xmath20 mass ratio is under - critical for atomic structure .",
    "the calculation of various tetraquarks in the harmonic oscillator basis @xcite have shown that only two tetraquark systems have their energy lower than the two - free - meson threshold , namely @xmath21 ( i=0,j=1 ) which we denote as @xmath22 and @xmath23 or @xmath24 ( i=1/2,j=1 ) , while @xmath25 or @xmath24 ( i=1/2,j=1 ) lie on the threshold .",
    "for deeply bound states , these results should be very accurate but since this basis can not accommodate asymptotic states of two free mesons , there is an open question whether or not weakly bound states of two mesons have been missed .    in our work",
    "we use an expansion in the basis proposed by @xcite which is described in appendix a. there are three different sets of internal coordinates .",
    "the first one ( fig.[ks ] a ) ) is convenient for expansion of those strongly correlated and deeply bound tetraquarks where we expect the _ atomic _ structure in which the diquark in @xmath26 formed by two heavy quarks plays a similar role as the heavy @xmath27 antiquark in the @xmath13 baryon , while the light quarks in both systems are in the same radial , spin , colour and isospin configurations .",
    "the second and third sets from fig .",
    "[ ks ] represent the direct and exchange meson - meson channels .",
    "these configurations are needed to build up the basis for the two free mesons - the threshold state , and are also of crucial importance for searching for weakly bound tetraquarks where the molecular structure would be dominant .",
    "we search for eigenstates of our hamiltonian using the variational method , applying a general diagonalization of the hamiltonian ( appendix b ) spanned by the non - orthogonal basis functions constructed in appendix a. we built the basis functions step by step by adding the best configurations from fig .",
    "[ ks ] with the best colour - spin configurations allowed for our quantum numbers ( is=01 , positive parity and colour singlet ) , after having optimized the corresponding gaussian widths .",
    "in order to obtain a 0.1 mev accuracy we constructed bases in this way with up to @xmath28 and @xmath29 functions for the @xmath22 and @xmath30 tetraquarks , respectively ( appendix d ) .",
    "these basis states can also accommodate two asymptotically free mesons if the four - body problem has no bound state .",
    "first we test our method on the @xmath22 system and compare our results with ref . @xcite . in our calculations",
    "we use two one - gluon exchange potentials , the bhaduri and al1 potential .",
    "their properties are described in appendix b. the bhaduri potential quite successfully describes the spectroscopy of the meson , as well as baryon ground states .",
    "this is an important condition since in the tetraquarks we have both quark - quark and quark - antiquark interactions .",
    "the al1 potential is just an improvement of the bhaduri potential where the smearing of the colour - magnetic term in the hamiltonian depends on the masses of the quarks .",
    "this then results in better quality of the meson spectra , in particular in the charmonium sector , where the bhaduri potential predict only half of the observed hyperfine splitting between the @xmath31 and @xmath32 state .",
    "the results obtained with the bhaduri potential are presented in the first three columns of table [ tabelabb ] where they are compared with results from @xcite . in the last three columns our and @xcite results for the al1 potential are listed . since the harmonic oscillator basis can not accommodate two asymptotically free mesons , one obtains a positive binding energy , as for example for spin 1 , isospin 1 state calculated with the bhaduri potential .",
    ".the mass of the @xmath22 tetraquark .",
    "column 1 : spin s , isospin i , column 2 : lowest meson - meson threshold for the bhaduri potential , column 3 : our results , column 4 : results of ref.@xcite where expansion in the harmonic oscillator basis was used , column 5 : lowest meson - meson threshold for the al1 potential , column 6 : our results with the al1 potential , column 7 : results of ref.@xcite where the same basis was used as in ref.@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "since the @xmath33 system is very weakly bound , a comment on long - range colour van der waals forces is in order @xcite .",
    "this forces appears due to the colour structure of the confining potential .",
    "they act between colour singlet clusters and their asymptotic behaviour depends on the power @xmath34 of the long range potential . in the case of the linear confining interaction",
    "we have @xmath35 this interaction appears due to the colour polarisation of two mesons in the colour singlet state .",
    "such a long - range colour force is not physically allowed and is artefact of the potential approach .",
    "it is not present in the full qcd where quark - anriquark pair creation from the confining field energy would produce an exponential cut - off of this residual interaction .",
    "one might be concerned , however , that this spurious interaction could have some misleading effects , when the system is very close to the threshold , as is the case with the @xmath33 tetraquark . to show that this is not the case",
    ", we present in fig .",
    "[ efpot ] the effective potential densities @xmath36     between ( anti)quarks as calculated from eq .",
    "[ vdw ] for bhaduri potential .",
    "inserted : enlarged section of the figure , where van der waals attraction and medium - range repulsion can be seen .",
    ", width=288 ]    in fig .",
    "[ efpot ] one can see that this effect is indeed present at large separations ( @xmath37 fm ) but it is extremely small",
    ". integrating this attractive tail of the potential contributes less than 100 kev to the binding of the system .",
    "another interesting feature of the effective potential shown in fig .",
    "[ efpot ] is the repulsion between quarks at the medium distance between quarks ( 1.5 @xmath38 2 fm ) .",
    "the maximal value of potential barrier is @xmath39 mev , too small to produce an additional resonant state .    at even shorter distances",
    "we have a strong attractive interaction between ( anti)quark-(anti)quark pairs , in particular there is a strong attraction between quark and antiquark . the major part of this interaction bind them into the @xmath40 or @xmath41 meson , since the molecular structure is dominant in the @xmath33 tetraquark . the residual part of this interaction helps together with the forces between quark - quark and antiquark - antiquark pairs to bind the two mesons into the tetraquark .",
    "this interactions are effective at small interquark distances ( @xmath42 fm ) , where the atomic configuration is important .",
    "therefore it is crucial even for the tetraquarks with molecular structure that the model used in the calculation is capable of describing accurately also the baryon spectra .",
    "we solve our four body problem by diagonalization of the hamiltonian in a space spanned by gaussian function .",
    "we built our basis step by step so that at each step all configurations @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) are tested and parameters @xmath45 are optimized .",
    "we then took the best configuration as the next base state .",
    "this procedure is very similar to the stochastic variational approach @xcite .",
    "the main reason for using gaussian basis is that all matrix elements can be evaluated analytically .",
    "tetraquark with bhaduri potential as a function of the number of the basis states for three different runs .",
    "the @xmath46 threshold is also shown .",
    "since the initial parameters are chosen randomly , the convergence is similar as with the stochastic variational approach .",
    ", width=288 ]    we were very careful that the basis states are linearly independent so that the eigenvalues of the overlap matrix @xmath47 is not too close to zero which would cause numerical instability .",
    "the dimension of the basis was between 100 ( al1 potential ) and 140 ( bhaduri potential ) .",
    "convergence of the energy of the @xmath30 tetraquark for three different runs of the code is shown in fig.[slkonvergence ] . here",
    "the asymptotic state of two free meson presents local minima toward which the results are converging at first . only at sufficiently large number of basis states ( @xmath48 ) the bound state can be recognized .",
    "the initial parameters are always randomly chosen and then the optimization by newton or simplex method is performed .    99 janc d. , rosina m. : few - body systems * 31 * , 1 ( 2001 ) zouzou s. , silvestre - brac b. , gignoux c. , richard j.m . : z. phys . *",
