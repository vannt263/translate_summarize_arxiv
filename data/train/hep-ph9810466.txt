    "nonforward matrix elements @xmath10 of quark and gluon light - cone operators which appear in applications of perturbative qcd to deeply virtual compton scattering ( dvcs ) and hard exclusive electroproduction processes @xcite can be parametrized by two basic types of nonperturbative functions .",
    "the double distributions ( dds ) @xmath11 @xcite specify the sudakov light - cone `` plus '' fractions @xmath12 and @xmath13 of the initial hadron momentum @xmath14 and the momentum transfer @xmath15 carried by the initial parton .",
    "treating the proportionality coefficient @xmath5 as an independent parameter one can introduce an alternative description in terms of the nonforward parton distributions ( nfpds ) @xmath16 with @xmath17 being the total fraction of the initial hadron momentum taken by the initial parton .",
    "the shape of nfpds explicitly depends on the parameter @xmath5 characterizing the _ skewedness _ of the relevant nonforward matrix element .",
    "this parametrization of nonforward matrix elements by @xmath16 is similar to that proposed by x. ji @xcite who introduced off - forward parton distributions ( ofpds ) @xmath18 in which the parton momenta and the skewedness parameter @xmath19 are measured in units of the average hadron momentum @xmath20 .",
    "there are one - to - one relations between ofpds and nfpds @xcite , so it is convenient to treat them as particular forms of _ skewed _ parton distributions ( spds ) .    in our approach ,",
    "dds are primary objects producing spds after an appropriate integration .",
    "our main goal in this letter is to show that using the formalism of dds ( in particular , their support and symmetry properties ) one can easily establish important features of spds such as nonanalyticity at border points @xmath21 and @xmath22 , polynomiality of their @xmath23 and @xmath24 moments in skewedness parameters @xmath5 and @xmath6 , etc .",
    "we also discuss simple models for dds which result in realistic models for spds .",
    "in the pqcd factorization treatment of hard electroproduction processes , the nonperturbative information is accumulated in the nonforward matrix elements @xmath25 of light cone operators @xmath26 .",

    "if we define the `` untilded '' dds by @xmath48 then @xmath46 is always positive and the reduction formulas have the same form @xmath49 in both cases .",

    "the double distributions @xmath11 are universal functions describing the flux of @xmath52 and @xmath53 independently of the ratio @xmath54 . note , that extraction of two separate components @xmath55 and @xmath56 from the quark dd @xmath57 as its positive-@xmath46 and negative-@xmath46 parts is unambiguous .    in principle , we can not exclude the third possibility that the functions @xmath58 have singular terms at @xmath59 proportional to @xmath60 or its derivative(s ) .",
    "such terms have no projection onto the usual parton densities .",
    "we will denote them by @xmath61 @xmath62 they may be interpreted as coming from the @xmath63-channel meson - exchange type contributions ( see fig.[fg : exchange]b ) . in this case , the partons just share the plus component of the momentum transfer @xmath15 : information about the magnitude of the initial hadron momentum is lost if the exchanged particle can be described by a pole propagator @xmath64 .",
    "hence , the meson - exchange contributions to a double distribution may look like @xmath65 where @xmath66 are the functions related to the distribution amplitudes of the relevant mesons @xmath67 .",

    "the structure of the integral ( [ 34 ] ) relating double distributions with the usual ones has a simple graphic illustration ( see fig.[fg : spds ] ) : integrating dds over a line orthogonal to the @xmath46 axis , we get @xmath100 .    the reduction formulas and interpretation of the @xmath46-variable as the fraction of the @xmath14 ( or @xmath101 ) momentum suggest that the profile of @xmath102 ( or @xmath103 ) in @xmath46-direction is basically determined by the shape of @xmath104 . on the other hand ,",

    "an alternative way to parametrize nonforward matrix elements of light - cone operators is to use @xmath5 ( or @xmath6 ) and the _ total _ momentum fractions @xmath129 ( or @xmath130 ) as independent variables .",
    "if we require that the light - cone plus components of both the momentum transfer @xmath15 and the final hadron momentum @xmath131 are positive , then @xmath132 and @xmath133 . using the spectral property @xmath134 of double distributions",

    "@xmath303 i.e. , the ofpd @xmath304 is obtained in this case by averaging the usual ( forward ) parton density @xmath305 ( extended onto @xmath38 ) over the region @xmath306 with the weight @xmath301 . in terms of nfpds ,",
    "the relation is @xmath307 i.e. , the average is taken over the region @xmath308 .",
    "the imaginary part of hard exclusive meson electroproduction amplitude is determined by the skewed distributions at the border point .",
    "for this reason , the magnitude of @xmath309 [ or @xmath310 , and its relation to the forward densities @xmath104 has a practical interest . assuming the infinitely narrow weight @xmath311 , we have @xmath312 and @xmath313 .",
    "hence , both @xmath309 and @xmath314 are given by @xmath315 because @xmath316 and @xmath317 .",
    "since the argument of @xmath104 is twice smaller than in deep inelastic scattering , this results in an enhancement factor .",
    "in particular , if @xmath318 for small @xmath46 , the ratio @xmath319 is @xmath320 .",
    "the use of a wider weight function @xmath301 produces further enhancement .",
    "for example , taking @xmath321 and @xmath318 we get @xmath322 which is larger than @xmath320 for @xmath323 . due to evolution ,",

    "the above ratio slowly increases with @xmath279 .",
    "finally , i want to point out that possible profiles of @xmath103 in the @xmath41-direction are restricted by inequalities ( see @xcite ) relating skewed and forward distributions . for quark ofpds ,",
    "i obtained @xcite @xmath324 if one uses the infinitely narrow model @xmath325 [ corresponding to @xmath326 , the inequality ( [ hq ] ) is satisfied for any function @xmath104 of @xmath327 type with @xmath328 .",
    "for the model ( [ ( 1-x)^3 ] ) which has a wider @xmath329 profile and @xmath330 , the inequality ( [ hq ] ) is exactly saturated .",
    "if one takes the model @xmath331 with an extremely wide profile , one obtains the result @xmath332 which violates ( [ hq ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we treated double distributions as the basic objects for parametrizing nonforward matrix elements . an alternative description in terms of skewed distributions",
    "was obtained by an appropriate integration of relevant dds .",
    "the use of dds helps to establish important features of spds such as their nonanalyticity at the border points @xmath153 and @xmath22 .",
    "dds are crucial for securing the property that the moments of spds should be polynomial in the skewedness parameter . for these reasons ,",
