    "understanding the physical state of the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) will be essential to exploiting this new data .",
    "in particular , it is necessary to develop methods of accurately modeling the thermal state of the gas in clusters before one can extract cosmological information from large surveys , which measure quantities arising from that state . for cluster - sized halos in a cosmological",
    "setting , the theoretical final distribution expected from the gravitational collapse of the dark matter ( dm ) is well understood @xcite .",
    "measurements of the dm density profile in galaxy groups and clusters agree well with this theoretical expectation @xcite . however , the hot intracluster gas in these systems does not parallel the dm in either density or temperature distribution .",
    "much progress has been made in understanding the expected icm distribution inside a standard dm halo ( with the density profile showing a power law cusp as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* or similar ) .",
    "@xcite gave an analytic expression for the density of isothermal gas in hydrostatic equilibrium with a nfw potential ; this was soon extended to non - isothermal gas with a polytropic equation of state @xcite , and to triaxial halos @xcite .",
    "the resulting gas profiles possess a finite density core , and not a cusp as seen in the dm .",
    "the gross energetics of the gas do not parallel that of the dm either . assuming that the gas energy comes solely from gravitational collapse gives the self - similar scalings between mass @xmath1 , luminosity @xmath2 , and temperature @xmath3 of @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "however , these scalings do not agree with the observed relations , leading @xcite to propose that non - gravitational energy injection is important .",
    "this idea has gained support from a number of analytic investigations into polytropic icm in dm potentials @xcite .",
    "an additional departure from self - similarity can come from star formation , which selectively removes gas with short cooling times , low entropy , and low total energy , leaving behind higher entropy material @xcite .",

    "it appears from the cited papers that both processes are at work : low entropy gas is incorporated into stars , and energy and metals are added to the remaining gas via feedback processes .",
    "based on these advances in our understanding of clusters , one can usefully combine prescriptions for gas physics with analytic modeling of dm profiles , but this method has limitations . since halos are formed by stochastic merging of subunits , there is true scatter in halo concentration and inner slope @xcite , which can vary with time and halo mass @xcite .",
    "similar variations exist in halo triaxiality ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "the clustering of halos has been shown to depend upon age or concentration , as well as mass ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",

    "@xcite improved on the use of analytic dm potentials by instead using the full three - dimensional potential of halos drawn from n - body simulations , combining these detailed 3-d models with current modeling of the gas physics .",
    "this procedure has the advantage of including the full distribution of halo concentration , as well as halo triaxiality and substructure . by drawing on a large n - body simulation volume ( computationally much less costly than a full hydrodynamic run ) , trends of internal halo properties with mass , location , and time",
    "are all included , along with halo - halo correlations .",
    "this procedure inevitably requires the utilization of certain dimensionless parameters which since they derive from feedback processes are difficult , at present , to determine from _ ab initio _ computations .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to tie down these parameters using observations of x - ray clusters . in particular , we apply the method of @xcite to a set of halos drawn from a large dm simulation of a cosmology in accord with the wmap 3-year data @xcite .",
    "the resulting catalog is compared to x - ray observations of nearby clusters .",
    "the amount of energy input from non - gravitational sources can significantly affect gas properties , but with the proper amount consistent with agn activity this method can reproduce the properties of the local cluster population .    the procedures used to create the simulated cluster sample are described in  [ sec : simclust ] , these clusters are compared to x - ray observations in  [ sec : effects ] , and we discuss the implications in  [ sec : discuss ] .",
    "one extension of this work is to use the gas properties to compute the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ; @xcite do this to make available simulated large - area , sub - arcminute resolution microwave sky maps .",
    "to produce a population of dm halos , we chose cosmological parameters to match the results from the 3-year wmap data combined with large - scale structure observations @xcite .",

    "the initial conditions for the @xmath20-body run were created with the grafic1 code @xcite , with a few modifications . because the spherical hanning filter employed in this code to isotropize small - scale structure also significantly suppresses power on small scales , it was not used .",
    "the linear dm transfer function at @xmath21 was calculated with the cmbfast @xcite code .",
    "the dm growth factor was used to scale the resulting power spectrum to the initial simulation redshift , chosen to be when the density fluctuation amplitude on the grid scale is 10% , @xmath22 . with these parameters ,",
    "a cluster with mass @xmath23 would contain @xmath24 particles ; a typical core radius for such a cluster would be @xmath25kpc , or 15 times the particle softening length .",
    "the simulation was run with the tpm code @xcite , with a couple of improvements over the publicly released version .",
    "most variables in the improved code are double precision ( including particle positions and velocities ) , with the main exception of accelerations and potentials , which are still single precision . also , no lower limit was set to the parameter @xmath26 used in the tpm domain decomposition ( see eqn . 5 of * ? ? ?",
    "this means that at late times there will be more particles followed at full force resolution , leading to improved simulation of the lowest mass objects ; at @xmath21 all cells with eight or more particles were followed with trees .",
    "the initial domain decomposition parameters were @xmath27 and @xmath28 , the pm mesh contained @xmath29 cells , and the maximum sub - box size was 256 cells . at the end of the run ,",
    "54% of the particles contained in 2% of the total volume were being followed with @xmath30 trees .    the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo finder with linking length @xmath31 was run on the simulation volume at @xmath21 , identifying almost @xmath32 halos with 30 or more particles .",
    "the resulting mass function agrees well with the fitting formula of @xcite ; the difference in the cumulative mass function is less than 5% over the range @xmath33 and less than 15% above this . in what follows",
    ", only halos containing gas with temperatures above 1.5kev will be included in our discussion .",
    "we find only halos with @xmath34 will ever meet this limit ( though typically it takes over twice this mass ) .",
    "@xmath35 corresponds to 150 particles , so the question arises as to whether or not there is sufficient numerical resolution for such halos . to test this , we compared the halos described in this paper with a sample taken from a higher resolution n - body simulation .",
    "this high resolution run has a box size @xmath36mpc and a spline softening length @xmath37kpc , so the mass resolution is thus improved by a factor of 30 and the spatial resolution by a factor of 5 ; otherwise it was generated and evolved in exactly the same manner as the simulation described above . when applying the gas prescription of the next section , we used a mesh cell size of @xmath38kpc , a factor of 3.4 smaller than the standard case ( it was difficult to go to any finer mesh because of the memory requirements of the resulting large computational arrays ) .",
    "the maximum feedback model ( described below ) was assumed .",
    "table [ tab : restest ] compares the mean and standard deviation for several observables predicted in the standard and high resolution runs , using two mass bins corresponding roughly to temperatures of 1.7 and 2 kev ; little difference is evident .",
    "a smaller cell size leads to a smaller volume around each halo ( for the same number of cells ) ; this accounts for most of the differences seen in the two samples the mass resolution is relatively unimportant .",
    "increasing the cell size to @xmath39kpc in the high resolution run results in a distribution even closer to the standard run .",
    "the gas distribution in each halo is calculated according to the prescription of @xcite .",
    "gas is placed in hydrostatic equilibrium with the dm gravitational potential of the halo using a polytropic equation of state .",
    "pressure balance with infalling gas near the virial radius and energy conservation determine the two constants required for the polytropic fit .",
    "two important processes alter the gas energy .",
    "star formation removes low entropy gas ; we fix the conversion of gas into stars at 10% .",
    "this leaves the most important free parameter , which is the energy input into the cluster gas via feedback processes .",
    "we will show that with a reasonable amount of feedback it is possible to match x - ray observations of hot cluster gas .    in detail ,",
    "a cubic mesh enclosing the particles is placed around the halo , with the cell size twice the particle spline softening length , or @xmath40kpc .",
    "the mass @xmath41 for each particle is placed on the mesh using the cloud - in - cell method , yielding the dm density , @xmath42 , for each cell @xmath43 .",
    "the gravitational potential on the mesh , @xmath44 , is computed from the density as in a standard particle - mesh code , but with a nonperiodic fft .",
    "the center of the cluster is defined as the cell with the lowest potential , @xmath45 .",
    "the radii enclosing various overdensities are calculated at this point , the outermost being the virial radius , @xmath46 , enclosing the overdensity expected from spherical tophat collapse , or 97 times the critical density at @xmath21 for the cosmology used here ( this is a change from * ? ? ?",
    "* where overdensity 200 was used ) .",
    "the velocity of the cluster as a whole is taken to be the mean velocity of the 125 particles closest to the cluster center ( or , for halos with fewer than 250 particles , the innermost half ) .",
    "particle velocities are moved to the rest frame of the cluster , and then the kinetic energy ( ke ) of each particle is placed on the grid in the same manner as the mass , yielding the ke per unit volume @xmath47 .",
    "it is assumed that gas originally had the same distribution as the dm , with density @xmath48 and ke @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) .",
    "a certain amount of the gas mass , @xmath51 ( described below ) , will have turned into stars ; this is presumably the most bound material , so cells are ranked by binding energy @xmath52 , and then cells are checked off until the sum of the masses @xmath53 equals @xmath51 .",
    "the initial mass @xmath54 and energy @xmath55 of the remaining gas are thus : @xmath56 @xmath57 where the sum is over all cells inside @xmath46 except those marked off for star formation .",
    "also , the gas surface pressure @xmath58 on the cluster exerted by surrounding material is estimated from the kinetic energy in a buffer region nine cells ( 293@xmath59kpc ) thick outside of @xmath46 : @xmath60 where the sum is over the @xmath61 cells in the buffer region @xmath62 .",
    "now suppose the gas is allowed to rearrange itself within the dm potential such that it is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has a polytropic equation of state with index @xmath63 .",
    "there is much support for such a model see the discussion and fig . 1 in ( * ? ?",
    "* comparing the polytropic model with a full , high resolution cosmological simulation by g. bryan ) , and also @xcite .",
    "we will treat the gas as a tracer such that the potential , set by the dm , does not change . defining @xmath64 as in @xcite , the resulting gas pressure @xmath65 and density @xmath66",
    "are given by    @xmath67    here @xmath68 is a nonthermal component of pressure , assumed to be proportional to thermal pressure such that the total @xmath69 . to specify the final gas distribution given these assumptions , two quantities still need to be determined , namely the pressure @xmath70 and density @xmath71 at the potential minimum .",
    "this can be done with two equations of constraint , derived by requiring conservation of energy and by matching the external surface pressure , as follows . for a given choice of @xmath70 and @xmath71 , the final radius @xmath72 of the gas initially inside @xmath46",
    "can be found by summing outwards from the cluster center until the initial mass @xmath54 is enclosed : @xmath73 this implies that gas may expand or contract , changing the gas fraction inside @xmath46 . assuming the external surface pressure changes little with radius",
    ", there will be mechanical work done , causing a change in energy proportional to the change in volume , @xmath74 .",
    "the equation for conservation of energy is thus @xmath75 the term @xmath76 is feedback inferred from supernovae and agn , discussed in more detail below . matching the final surface pressure to the external pressure yields the other equation of constraint : @xmath77 again summing in a buffer region @xmath78 .",
    "( note the @xmath68 terms were omitted in * ? ? ?",
    "with eqns .",
    "( [ eqn:3dfe ] ) and ( [ eqn:3dfp ] ) it is possible to iterate ( e.g. with newton - raphson ) to a solution for the final gas density and pressure ( or temperature ) profile .",
    "for this paper we will assume that at @xmath21 the initial ( that is , inside @xmath46 prior to any rearrangement ) star to gas ratio is 10% , in other words @xmath79 , which implies @xmath80 .",
    "this ratio agrees well with the value in nearby clusters measured by @xcite , and is slightly lower than that measured by @xcite .",
    "star and black hole formation will return energy to the remaining gas via supernovae and agn activity writing this energy as @xmath76 of course assumes this energy is proportional to stellar mass .",
    "this seems plausible : the number of supernovae is expected to be proportional to the mass in stars , and the mass of central black holes in spheriods is roughly proportional to the stellar mass in these systems @xcite . improved observational constraints may alter this assumption .",
    "the rough estimate given in @xcite is that @xmath81 for sn and @xmath82 for agn , so we will take @xmath83 as the maximum case .",
    "this is roughly 3 kev per particle for the gas inside the virial radius , which is at the high end of the plausible range .      to characterize the temperature of the gas we will use @xmath84 , the x - ray emission - weighted @xmath3 inside a projected radius of @xmath85 .",
    "the x - ray luminosity is calculated using the cooling function @xmath86 of @xcite for @xmath87 , and assuming @xmath88 for @xmath89 ; the metallicity is set to one third solar @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that the projected spectroscopic temperature of a thermally complex cluster will in fact be lower than the emission - weighed temperature .",
    "however , this difference will be more pronounced when computing a single - temperature fit to a full hydrodynamic simulation ( containing shocks , cold fronts , and other short - lived structures ) than it is in our simple equilibrium models ( which lack such local inhomogeneities ) because such features , which increase the thermal complexity of the gas , contribute to this systematic bias @xcite . in order to quantify this effect , we compared @xmath84 with @xmath90 , the spectroscopic temperature measured in the range @xmath91 .",
    "we used the code developed by @xcite to compute @xmath90 , using the chandra response function and galactic absorption @xmath92 .",
    "note that simply excluding the center reduces the measured @xmath90 relative to @xmath84 , independent of spectral effects . for the maximum feedback model ,",
    "we find @xmath93kev , with little scatter ; in other words , the two agree within 10% .",
    "given this small difference , we will use the conceptually simpler @xmath84 unless stated otherwise .",
    "x - ray surveys provide valuable information on the luminosity , temperature , and mass of clusters . in this section",
    "we explore these properties as derived using the method of the previous section .",
    "the relationship between mass and temperature is shown in fig@xmath94[fig : tvsm ] .",
    "the temperature is the emission - weighted @xmath84 inside a projected radius @xmath85 , and the mass is that contained in a spherical overdensity of 500 times critical , @xmath95 .",
    "lines show the median mass at a given temperature , and the shaded regions enclose 68% of the clusters ; the cases of no feedback ( @xmath96 ) and maximum feedback ( @xmath83 ) are shown .",
    "feedback has little effect for the hottest , most massive clusters : the feedback energy is small compared to the binding energy of these clusters , and thus of little importance to the dynamical state of the gas .",
    "feedback has a greater effect in less massive clusters , making the gas somewhat hotter .",
    "still , at @xmath97 , feedback increases @xmath3 by only @xmath98% .",
    "one effect not apparent from the figure is that for masses below @xmath99 the maximum feedback can be enough to make the total gas energy positive , unbinding the gas from the halo .",
    "thus our method produces no halos with temperatures below about 1.5 kev in the maximum feedback case .",
    "the data points shown in this figure are from @xcite , who combined asca observations with the extended rosat hiflugcs sample of @xcite ; cluster cores were not excluded when @xmath3 was determined .",
    "only those clusters closer than @xmath100 are shown .",
    "below 4 kev , the feedback model provides a superior fit ; both models are in agreement with the data above this .",
    "however , there is significantly more scatter in the observed @xmath101 relation than is produced in our model .",
    "cooling ( which we neglect beyond that involved in star formation ) will increase the scatter in this relation @xcite .",
    "the existence of young systems which are out of dynamical equilibrium can also broaden the observed @xmath101 relation , but the effects may not be very pronounced @xcite ; we are to some extent accounting for this , because merging halos will have greater kinetic energy per particle and thus a higher temperature than a relaxed halo of the same mass .",
    "we have not modeled observational error , which will also of course add to any intrinsic scatter .",
    "our predicted @xmath101 relations change little if we instead use the spectroscopic temperature , as shown in fig@xmath94[fig : sptvsm ] .",
    "also shown are ten nearby , relaxed clusters observed with xmm - newton by @xcite and ten relaxed clusters observed with chandra by @xcite . both used spectroscopic temperatures , and excluded the cores ( although the radial range used to determine @xmath3 is slightly different ) .",
    "these observations exhibit considerably smaller scatter , lending credence to the idea that differing dynamical states and cooling in cores will increase the scatter in temperature at a given mass . as was the case before",
    ", both models agree reasonably well with the observed @xmath101 relation above 4 kev , but the high feedback case is a better fit in the 23 kev range",
    ". the @xmath101 relation can be well fit by the power law @xmath102 where @xmath103 .",
    "@xcite found @xmath104 and @xmath105 for their sample , while @xcite obtained @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "we first attempted to fit this relation to the simulated halos with ordinary least - squares regression in the log - log plane , but this was dominated by the more numerous low mass halos and unduly affected by outliers .",
    "thus we instead adopted the following procedure : we divided the @xmath108-axis into 20 logarithmically spaced bins , calculated the median in each bin , and then found the best fit to these points .",
    "this in effect gives more massive clusters a higher weight in the fitting ; the resulting fits follow closely the median lines in the figures . as listed in table [ tab : olsfits ] , fitting to all halos with @xmath109kev in the zero feedback model gives @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "this follows the self - similar slope of 1.5 , and gives cooler clusters at a fixed mass than is observed . in",
    "the maximum feedback case temperatures shift to higher values , and the slope becomes steeper : @xmath112 and @xmath113 .",
    "this slope agrees well with the observations , although the normalization yields slightly hotter clusters at a given mass .",
    "the formal error we obtain for @xmath114 is small ( near one percent ) so in table [ tab : olsfits ] we give the @xmath115 fractional difference of the halos from the best - fit relation ; this scatter reflects well the width of the shaded regions in the figures . if the amount of feedback @xmath116 varied from cluster to cluster , then the scatter seen would be larger .",
    "another method of characterizing nearby clusters is the temperature function , which does not require a mass determination .",
    "the distribution of cluster temperatures is sensitively dependent on the cosmological model ; in @xcite , which used the first - year wmap power spectrum amplitude , the fit to observations was inadequate . shown in fig@xmath94[fig : noft ] are two measurements of the cumulative temperature function , with different methods of determining the cluster temperature : @xcite excluded cluster cores when fitting for @xmath3 , while @xcite did not . for purposes of comparison , we took from the simulation a `` light cone '' covering one octant of the sky out to @xmath117 .",
    "this covers the redshift range used in the observations , although they are not volume limited . during the simulation ,",
    "the matter distribution in a series of thin shells was saved ; the radius of each shell corresponds to the light travel time from a @xmath21 observer sitting at the origin of the box , and its width corresponds to the time interval between shells .",
    "thus a volume - limited mass distribution , including time evolution , is obtained .",
    "locating halos and adding gas was done in the same manner as before . to compute the star / gas ratio at @xmath118",
    ", the star formation rate was assumed to follow a delayed exponential model ( eqn . 1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , with decay time @xmath119gyr .",
    "both @xmath84 and @xmath90 are shown for the @xmath83 feedback model in fig@xmath94[fig : noft ] . because our cosmological parameters were chosen in part to match large - scale structure observations , and the simulated @xmath120 relation matches that of nearby clusters , it is not surprising that our simulated temperature function is a reasonable fit to the observed one .",
    "our @xmath84 , which includes the core , gives a higher abundance in the @xmath121 kev range than the @xcite data , while our @xmath90 , excluding the core , instead gives a lower abundance than @xcite .",
    "the zero feedback model appears to give temperatures that are too low ; thus based simply on @xmath3 , it appears that some non - gravitational energy input is required to explain the properties of existing clusters . the model with feedback and wmap 3-year cosmological parameters now provides a good fit to the observed temperature function .",
    "other cluster observables are more dependent on the gas density , most notably x - ray luminosity .",
    "the top panel of fig@xmath94[fig : lxandf ] shows the @xmath122 relation of our simulated catalog for three values of feedback , again with medians shown as lines and shaded regions enclosing 68% of the clusters ; here @xmath123 is the bolometric luminosity inside a projected radius of @xmath85 . unlike the @xmath101 relation",
    ", feedback produces a significant change in @xmath123 at a given temperature because the bremsstrahlung emission is proportional to the square of the gas density , but otherwise there are similar trends seen . again",
    "the effect of feedback is less important in the most massive clusters , where gravitational binding energy dominates .",
    "also , the scatter for a given amount of feedback is much smaller than that observed in nearby clusters ( the data points are again from * ? ? ?",
    "* with @xmath100 ) .",
    "the zero feedback and @xmath83 models bracket the range of luminosities seen in nearby clusters . an intermediate model with @xmath124",
    "is also shown in fig@xmath94[fig : lxandf ] ; it appears this is an insufficient amount to explain the lowest luminosity clusters . fitting a power law @xmath125 to all our halos with @xmath109kev yields @xmath126 in the zero feedback case , not as steep as the self - similar expectations of of @xmath127 .",
    "including feedback steepens this relation considerably to @xmath128 , more in line with the observed value ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the exact value of the slope we find depends on the lower temperature limit used .",
    "a more direct probe of gas density is the gas fraction within a given radius .",
    "it appears that the gas fraction increases with increasing radius , and higher temperature clusters have a higher gas fraction as well @xcite .",
    "the gas fraction from our model is shown in the bottom panel of fig@xmath94[fig : lxandf ] , with @xmath129 defined as the fraction of the total mass inside a spherical radius @xmath95 enclosing an overdensity 500 times critical ; for the purpose of computing the total mass , we assumed that stellar mass followed the same radial profile as the dark matter .",
    "the model curves display the type of behavior one might expect based on the top panel : models with feedback show significantly lower gas fractions ( i.e. lower densities at a given @xmath3 ) , with the effect being most pronounced for the lowest mass clusters .",
    "recent observations of the gas fraction by @xcite are shown in the figure , as well as two clusters from @xcite , where for these points the temperature was derived from @xmath130 using the @xmath101 relation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* note they use a spectroscopic temperature , and exclude the central region when finding @xmath3 ) . also shown as a dashed line is the best fit @xmath131 relation found by @xcite using 45 rosat clusters and temperatures taken from the literature . here again , some feedback is required to bring the models in agreement with observed gas fractions , but again the spread in any given model is too small to fit all observed values of @xmath129 .    also shown as a dotted line in the figure is the mean gas fraction from our cosmological model , after turning enough gas into stars to make the global star / gas ratio ten percent , or @xmath132 . without any feedback , the baryon fraction inside @xmath95 will reflect the cosmic mean value , but energy input drives this fraction lower , particularly for smaller clusters .",
    "we find the gas fraction increases with radius , so at overdensities higher than 500 this discrepancy will be even greater .",
    "this raises the question of how far out one must go before the cluster contains a fair sample of the cosmic mass budget .",
    "fig@xmath94[fig : gfrac ] shows the median gas fraction inside the virial radius as a function of temperature ( still using @xmath84 inside @xmath85 ) ; the virial overdensity is 97 times critical for our chosen cosmology . even at this radius , it is only for the most massive clusters ( @xmath133kev ) that the baryon fraction reaches the cosmic mean ; in smaller clusters feedback causes the gas to expand , reducing the gas fraction by many tens of percent .",
    "attempts to determine the cosmic baryon density from clusters will need to take this effect into account .",
    "fig@xmath94[fig : gfrac ] also demonstrates how the median gas fraction changes in the maximum feedback case if we also add a relativistic component with @xmath134 ( there is little change in the spread around the median ) . with this component",
    ", a lower temperature is required to achieve pressure balance at a given density .",
    "this model behaves like the no feedback case at higher masses , and like an intermediate feedback case at lower masses .",
    "this behavior also holds for all the other relationships ( @xmath135 , etc . )",
    "explored in this paper ; thus it seems a relativistic component will have little effect on thermal cluster observables .",
    "while our implementation is quite simplified , similar results were found using full hydrodynamic simulations by @xcite : they found that including the effects of cosmic rays caused only small changes in the gas fraction and integrated sz signal ( they found a larger change in @xmath123 , but this was related to cooling cores , which we do not implement ) .    to summarize this section , we find that a wmap 3-year cosmological model coupled with a feedback parameter of @xmath136 ( which corresponds to an input energy of roughly 2 - 3 kev per baryon ) provides a good fit to the extant x - ray observations of hot gas in clusters .",
    "in this paper we have presented a method for determining the gas distribution inside a fully three - dimensional potential ; this method assumes hydrostatic equilibrium and a polytropic equation of state , and also that the original gas energy per unit mass equals that of the dm .",
    "we then applied this method to a @xmath21 catalog of dm cluster halos drawn from n - body simulations , and compared the resulting icm distributions to observations of nearby clusters .",
    "the main result is that this simple gas prescription can reproduce many of the observed bulk properties of the icm , including the temperature distribution and the relationships between temperature and mass , x - ray luminosity , or gas fraction .",
    "the main drawback is that in nearby x - ray clusters there is significantly more scatter seen in these relationships than is produced in our method .",
    "this could be due to a number of factors , including cooling cores , our assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium , and observational errors .",
    "the advantages of using this type of model for the icm are clear .",
    "it is possible to simulate a large volume with a n - body code at much smaller computational cost than is required for a full hydrodynamical treatment . when adding gas with the method described here , the distributions of internal halo properties concentration , triaxiality , substructure , etc. are taken into account , as are their trends with mass , location , and time , plus any alignments and correlations between halos .",
    "however , it should be noted that this approach does not account for the dynamical effects of a baryonic component .",
    "results from halo formation simulations demonstrate that including a dissipational gas component can alter the radial profile of the dm halo @xcite and its ellipticity @xcite , which would in turn alter the icm distribution .",
    "a second result is that a significant amount of non - gravitational energy input is required to reproduce the properties of nearby clusters .",
    "many other investigators have reached the same conclusion ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) . in this paper we do not try to find the sources of this input .",
    "instead , we simply ascertain what level of feedback would produce the observed relations among cluster observables .",
    "processes involved in star formation provide some of this energy , but not enough . the most likely source for extra",
    "energy is agn , which can conceivably deliver enough feedback to explain the temperature , x - ray luminosity , and gas fraction distributions of local clusters .",
    "however , there is little margin for error : if we have overestimated the amount of star formation , the black hole to stellar mass ratio is less than 0.0013 , and/or the amount of energy returned to the gas by black hole formation is less than 3% of the black hole rest mass , then the required energy of 2 to 3 kev per particle will not be produced .",
    "this conclusion differs somewhat from that of @xcite , who find that agn heating is an implausible ( though not impossible ) explanation of cluster gas fractions ; they calculate that in order to reduce the gas fraction within @xmath95 to the observed level it would take 10 kev per particle in the gas observed within @xmath95 ( roughly 0.12 @xmath130 ) . rescaling this value to our normalization ( energy per particle of the gas mass initially inside @xmath46 , or @xmath137 ) , makes this a required energy of roughly 4 kev per particle .",
    "the reason we require less energy is in part due to a different initial state : examining the lower panel of fig@xmath94[fig : lxandf ] , by just accounting for star formation but not including any feedback , one can see our method leads to a gas fraction inside @xmath95 already lower than the cosmic mean , while @xcite started with a state in which the gas fraction equals the cosmic mean .",
    "( although in any case they argue that efficiencies of agn outbursts are @xmath138 , not @xmath139 ) . running hydrodynamic simulations without radiation or feedback , @xcite found the baryon fraction inside @xmath95 of 90% , which agrees well with our method at higher masses .",
    "however , @xcite also find this fraction still holds at lower masses , and that the baryon fraction is still 90% at the virial radius ( again with no feedback ) , while we find a higher fraction in both of these instances .",
    "note that if we had instead started with an initial state consistent with a 90% baryon fraction , then we would require a lower amount of feedback to reproduce observed gas fractions .",
    "it is useful in this context to compare with recent hydrodynamical simulations which include feedback .",
    "the left panel of fig@xmath94[fig : sims ] relates gas to total mass inside @xmath95 ; the solid line shows the best - fit power law relation at @xmath21 found from adaptive refinement simulations by @xcite . with no feedback we find a similar slope ( slightly larger than unity ) , but for a given halo mass there is a higher gas fraction than in the simulations . adding feedback reduces this discrepancy at higher masses , but at lower masses our maximum feedback case instead has lower gas fractions . as @xcite did not attempt to include agn feedback it is not surprising that an intermediate amount of feedback would provide the best match .",
    "we do not match the simulations when it comes to the total mass - temperature relation , however .",
    "( [ eqn : mtpowlaw ] ) , @xcite find @xmath140 and @xmath141 , while @xcite with an sph simulation find @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "we obtain a similar slope ( @xmath144 ) , but more importantly we find a different normalization that is , we find hotter temperatures at a given mass , as would be expected because we included a higher level of feedback ,    the near future will see a number of surveys that select clusters of galaxies via their sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) decrement , which is proportional to the gas pressure in the cluster integrated along the line of sight .",
    "currently the sunyaev - zeldovich array ( sza ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the arc minute microkelvin imager ( ami ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are equipped to perform such a search on tens of square degrees on the sky .",
    "however , the atacama cosmology telescope ( act ) , the south pole telescope ( spt ) , apex , and ultimately the planck surveyor will scan thousands of square degrees on the sky in the radio @xcite .",
    "these surveys will detect thousands of clusters ; for example , the spt will scan 4,000 @xmath145 on the sky and observe of the order of @xmath146 clusters of galaxies ( this is for a flux sensitivity of about @xmath147mjy at the 4-sigma detection threshold with a 1 arcmin beam operating at 150 ghz , and assumes @xmath148 ) .",
    "this translates to a limiting mass of @xmath149 if one assumes the clusters are in hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "@xcite found a similar limit for a 90% complete cluster sample from act .",
    "the redshift distribution of clusters is very sensitive to the amplitude and growth of linear perturbations , and hence to cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "however , in order to exploit sz cluster number counts one is required to understand the selection function of these surveys .",
    "this is most easily accomplished in terms of the flux decrement , which depends on the system temperature , exposure time , band - width , and efficiency @xcite .",
    "in order to obtain cosmological constraints , it is necessary to convert the observables into a limiting mass of the survey .",
    "there are two approaches to obtain this mass limit .",
    "one is to start with the assumption that all clusters are spherical and in hydrostatic equilibrium , and then include some nuisance parameters to allow for deviations from this assumption @xcite .",
    "another approach is to use a very general parameterization of the mass  observable relation , which in its most general form could easily introduce forty unknown parameters @xcite .",
    "currently there is little data to constrain the free parameters in either approach . in future",
    "one can exploit the sz cluster observations themselves , to self - calibrate these free parameters @xcite .",
    "however if one employs the most general parameterization , little power is left in the surveys to constrain cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "another possibility would be to use complementary observations , such as weak lensing to cross - calibrate the mass - observable relation @xcite .",
    "a useful approach would be to have a physical parameterization of the mass - observable relation with some prior probability on the free parameters and then self - calibrate the sz surveys for these parameters @xcite . however in order to obtain this prior knowledge we can not yet rely on observations because currently they are sparse , and in the near future observations will not resolve clusters because the beams of the instruments are typically larger than 1 arcmin .",
    "we hence require simulations to explore the scatter in the mass - observable relation ; in order to obtain realistic results , a large representative sample of galaxy clusters is required .",
    "@xcite have already applied the method of this paper to a full light - cone n - body output ( out to @xmath150 ) in order to generate and make publicly available large - area , sub - arcminute resolution microwave sky maps .",
    "we intend to provide a detailed analysis of the mass - observable relation in a forthcoming paper , and will give here only a rough qualitative discussion .",
    "in particular , we can use our @xmath21 simulated catalog to explore how the amount of thermal energy in the gas will affect the sz signal .",
    "one can express the strength of the integrated sz flux as @xmath151 where the integration limits are along the line of sight through the entire cluster , and over area out to projected radius @xmath85 .",
    "the right panel of fig@xmath94[fig : sz ] displays how the sz signal varies with cluster mass in our model , for the zero and maximum feedback cases . at higher masses",
    "the relation has little dependence on feedback .",
    "feedback reduces the sz signal somewhat ( as it results in gas being pushed out of the higher pressure cluster cores ) and makes the relation steeper . fitting to halos with @xmath152",
    ", we find @xmath153 with zero feedback .",
    "this is close to the self - similar slope of 5/3 predicted for spherical profiles ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; apparently triaxiality and substructure have little effect on this relation .",
    "the slope steepens only slightly to 1.69 for @xmath83 ; this is in reasonable agreement with the analytic results of @xcite and with hydrodynamic simulations @xcite .",
    "the exact slope found for this relation depends on the lower mass limit used ; if we included lower mass halos ( or weighted the high mass halos less ) the resulting slope would be steeper .",
    "the left panel of fig@xmath94[fig : sz ] shows how @xmath154 varies with temperature .",
    "the relation is quite tight , and again steepens with increasing feedback ; fitting to halos with @xmath109kev , @xmath155 with no feedback , the exponent increasing to 2.77 for @xmath83 .",
    "the zero feedback slope agrees well with the adiabatic simulation of @xcite , but the feedback model is steeper , because we are putting in more energy .",
    "increasing @xmath116 from zero to @xmath83 lowers the sz signal at k@xmath156kev by 35% , which is similar to but slightly less than the effect seen by @xcite between his adiabatic and star formation runs .",
    "a more detailed comparison is difficult because we are using the projected sz signal ; also there are differences in the cosmological parameters .",
    "this work makes it clear that allowance for feedback will be necessary if one is to utilize the upcoming sz surveys for precision measurements of cosmological parameters .",
    "fortunately , x - ray observations allow us to calibrate the feedback parameter ; adequate fits to the data can be obtained if the ratio of energy input to stellar mass is @xmath136 .",
    "uncertainties in this parameter will propagate into uncertainties in the mass - flux decrement relation for sz surveys .",
    "however , it can be seen in fig@xmath94[fig : sz ] that even the extreme case of reducing @xmath116 to zero hardly changes this relation for clusters with masses above @xmath157 .",
    "moreover , it is not the scatter in the mass - observable relation which makes it difficult for future sz surveys to constrain cosmological parameters , but rather it is the uncertainty in the scatter which is the main problem @xcite .",
    "we will use the methods of this paper to explore these issues in future work .",
