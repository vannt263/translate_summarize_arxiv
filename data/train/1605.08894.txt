    "there are three methods of trapping neutral atoms that have been in the past been described theoretically and applied in many experiments ( see , for example , the reviews in @xcite ) .",
    "these are : magnetic traps , radiation - pressure traps , and optical dipole traps . in the present paper",
    "we analyze a different trap produced by the electromagnetic wave carrying orbital angular momentum .",
    "the atomic magnetic moment interacts with the magnetic field of such waves as in standard magnetic traps .",
    "however , in contrast to the traps in which the magnetic field is static , our trapping mechanism exploits in an essential way the _ rotation _ of the magnetic field .",
    "rotation of the magnetic field is necessary since owing to the earnshaw theorem static magnetic fields can not trap particles with permanent magnetic moments .",
    "one method to overcome the limitations imposed by the earnshaw theorem is to use diamagnetic levitating objects @xcite .",
    "another method is to employ the rotation of the magnets as in levitrons@xmath0 @xcite .",
    "our method may be viewed as an application of this last idea to atomic objects .",
    "the rotation of the atomic magnetic moment is achieved by placing the atom in the magnetic field of an electromagnetic wave endowed with orbital angular momentum .",
    "the rotating magnetic field of such a wave plays a similar role to the rotating electric field in the paul trap @xcite .",
    "our theoretical tool is the set of coupled ehrenfest equations for the translational and spin degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "they are derived from the schrdinger - pauli equation for a neutral particle endowed with the magnetic moment @xmath1 , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the gyromagnetic ratio and the spin vector @xmath4 is built from the appropriate spin matrices .",
    "the sign of @xmath3 is positive or negative depending on whether the magnetic moment is parallel or antiparallel to the spin angular momentum .",
    "for the electron the spin operator contains pauli matrices , @xmath5 and the gyromagnetic ratio is @xmath6 .",
    "the classical evolution equations are universal ; they do not depend on the value of the spin .",
    "we shall study the case when the magnetic field is a combination of the wave with the vortex line and a static component .",
    "we consider two cases : the running wave and the standing wave .",
    "the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field in these two cases is given by the formulas :    [ field ] @xmath7,\\\\ & { \\bm b}_{\\rm st}({\\bm r},t)=\\left[\\!\\begin{array}{c}\\label{st } b_\\perp k\\cos(kz)[y\\cos(\\omega t)-x\\sin(\\omega t)]\\\\ b_\\perp k\\cos(kz)[x\\cos(\\omega t)+y\\sin(\\omega t)]\\\\ b_z \\end{array}\\!\\right],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the wave number , @xmath10 measures the strength of the vortex wave , and @xmath11 is the constant field . in order to preserve the correct dimension of @xmath10 we inserted a factor of @xmath12 in these formulas .",
    "the vortex part can be viewed as the paraxial approximation of either a bessel beam or a laguerre - gauss beam with orbital angular momentum quantum number equal to 1 .",
    "of course , the magnetic fields ( [ field ] ) , together with their electric counterparts , are exact solutions of maxwell s equations but the question is whether it is a good approximation of a realistic beam .",
    "one may explain this approximation by starting from the exact formulas for the bessel or the laguerre - gauss beams .",
    "for bessel beams the size of the waist is determined by the inverse of the transverse wave vector @xmath13 and for laguerre - gauss beams it is determined by the waist size parameter @xmath14 ( see , for example @xcite ) .",
    "the approximation leading to the formulas ( [ field ] ) is essentially the paraxial approximation .",
    "it simply consists ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) of the replacement of the exact solutions by the first term of the expansion in the following dimensionless parameter : the ratio of the distance from the beam center to the size of the beam waist . therefore , our approximate formulas are valid for distances smaller that the beam waist",
    ".    similar solutions of maxwell equations have appeared before in our study of the trapping of charged particles by electromagnetic vortices @xcite . however , this time in addition to a running wave , we consider also a standing wave .",
    "we show that the standing wave can trap particles also along the beam direction .",

    "note that the sum of the squares of the spin expectation values yields 1/4 and not 3/4 as one might have thought .",
    "this is due to the difference between the square of an average value and the average value squared . in particular , for the pauli matrices we obtain : @xmath30 but @xmath31 .",
    "the equations of motion expressed in terms of the new spin variables are autonomous which significantly simplifies their analysis . in the dimensionless form",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we show typical trajectories in these two cases .",

    "if this condition is not satisfied , one would have to use a more accurate description of the electromagnetic beams using , for example , exact laguerre - gauss beams or bessel beams .",
    "the running wave can not trap particles in the direction of the wave propagation .",
    "this is due to the fact that the running wave has the screw symmetry which makes all positions along the @xmath40-axis equivalent .",
    "in contrast , the standing wave breaks this symmetry . in this case",
    "we do not have the constant of motion connected with the screw symmetry .",

    "we have now the full energy , @xmath104    the equations of motion ( [ eqsd2 ] ) under a proper choice of parameters have fully localized solutions .",
    "the trapping is most effective near the nodes of the magnetic field , i.e. at all values @xmath105 where the magnetic field vanishes ( @xmath106 is an odd number ) .",
    "in addition , it turns out that the trajectories in the standing wave are localized much better in the _ transverse direction _ than the corresponding trajectories in the running wave . in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we show two trajectories obtained for the same values of the parameters and the initial data .",

    "( [ cheq ] ) are complex .",
    "it is , therefore , not surprising on the basis of our analysis in the previous section that the trajectory in the running wave leaves the trap .",
    "what is unexpected is a perfect trapping by the standing wave for the same parameters when the running wave does not trap .        the shape and the overall size of the trajectory depends very sensitively on the initial value of @xmath107 .",
    "when this value departs even slightly from the node value , the trapping becomes less effective . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] we show a sixfold increase in the size of the orbit when the initial value of @xmath107 is changed from its node value @xmath108 by merely 0.03 .",
    "we have already noticed that when the oscillations of @xmath80 have a small amplitude one may find trapped approximate analytic solutions that are close to numerical solutions . of course , the equations of motion will possess a trapped solution only if @xmath69 is a real root of eq .",
    "( [ cheq ] ) . continuing this line of thought",
    ", we shall now look for solutions that have no oscillations .",
    "it turns out that in this case we will obtain exact analytic solutions .",
    "the condition for the existence of such solutions is the vanishing of the right - hand side in eqs .",
    "( [ eqsd1]g ) and ( [ eqsd2]g ) . this will be achieved if the vectors @xmath109 and @xmath110 are perpendicular .",
    "this condition is satisfied owing to our conditions ( [ scond ] ) imposed on the initial data in order to have only one frequency .",
    "luckily , it so happens that the orthogonality condition is satisfied at all times and we obtain in this way exact analytic solutions .",
    "we construct exact solutions starting from the evolution equations ( [ eqsd1 ] ) and ( [ eqsd2 ] ) and we rewrite them in the complexified form as in ( [ eqs3 ] ) . in the case of the running wave the motion in the @xmath40-direction",
    "does not matter , while in the case of the standing wave we choose @xmath111 .",
    "then in both cases the equations for the motion in the @xmath37-plane have the same form .",

    "the radius of the circle depends on the parameters @xmath116 , on the value of the spin in the transverse direction @xmath117 , and on the choice of one of the three roots of the characteristic equations .",

    "we still obtain an exact solution but the trajectory either shrinks or runs away , depending on the sign of the imaginary part of @xmath69 .",
    "when for a given choice of parameters the characteristic equation has complex roots , even for the real root the circular trajectory becomes unstable .",
    "in this section we will apply our results to the analysis of solutions for the realistic values of the parameters .",
    "the most obvious application of the model described here is to the motion of the hydrogen atom .",
    "unfortunately , the large mass of the atom makes the trapping difficult .",
    "nevertheless for very cold atoms the trap may be effective .",
    "also the huge magnetic moment of highly excited circular rydberg atoms might be helpful .    in fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] we plot the trajectories for a microwave trap , @xmath120/s , in the vicinity of the resonance .",
    "the resonance regime is harder to achieve for optical frequencies , as seen in ( [ def]e ) , since it would require magnetic fields of the order of @xmath121 t .",
    "the characteristic feature of the orbits in the vicinity of the resonance is their rotation .",
    "this rotation is not present in our approximate solutions ( [ ell ] ) and reflects the failure of this approximation near the resonance .",
    "the average size of the orbit , as seen in formula ( [ dapr ] ) , grows linearly with the initial velocity .",
    "therefore , at some value of @xmath122 ( depending on the values of all parameters ) the simplified description of the electromagnetic wave becomes inapplicable .",
    "it may seem that the trapping would work better for the positronium because its mass is much smaller .",
    "however , the average value of the magnetic moment vanishes for both orthopositronium and parapositronium @xcite",
    ". it could be different from zero only for the superposition of ortho and para states . to create such a superposition , however , one would have to overcome the energy barrier of @xmath123 ev , and that would require very strong ( many teslas ) magnetic field .",
    "we have shown , with the use of the ehrenfest equations generalized to the case of spinning particles , that neutral particles endowed with a magnetic moment are trapped by the combination of a constant magnetic field and the rotating magnetic field of a wave carrying orbital angular momentum .",
    "we considered two cases : the running wave and the standing wave . in the first case the trapping takes place only in the plane perpendicular to the wave direction . in the second case we obtained full trapping in three dimensions .",
    "we analyzed in detail the solutions of the resulting sets of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that describe the time evolution of the average values of the particle coordinates and the magnetic moment .",
    "the most intricate properties of the solutions were found in the vicinity of the resonance when the wave frequency is approaching the larmor precession frequency in the constant field .",
    "the phenomenon of trapping has been fully established but its efficiency is controlled by a small parameter : the ratio of the larmor frequency to the wave frequency . for strong magnetic fields ( a few teslas ) and relatively low frequency ( microwaves )",
    "this parameter may be of the order of 1 .",
    "this is the resonance regime where the trapping is most effective .",

    "<S> the motion of a neutral atom endowed with a magnetic moment interacting with the magnetic field is determined from the ehrenfest - like equations of motion . </S>",
    "<S> these equations for the average values of the translational and spin degrees of freedom are derived from the schrdinger - pauli wave equation and they form a set of nine coupled nonlinear evolution equations . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical and analytic solutions of these equations are obtained for the combination of the rotating magnetic field of a wave carrying orbital angular momentum and a static magnetic field . the running wave traps the atom only in the transverse direction while the standing wave traps the atom also in the direction of the beam . </S>"
