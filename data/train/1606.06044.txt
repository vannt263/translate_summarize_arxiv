    "it is generally accepted that most stars ( between @xmath1% ) are born in star clusters @xcite , which are naturally associated to high density regions in molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "few million years after its formation , the number of observed clusters falls drastically @xcite .",
    "a rapid disruption of these stellar systems , which affects a high proportion of them , occurs at early dynamical evolutionary stages when embedded clusters remove their gas component @xcite . at this time",
    ", stellar winds from massive stars and ejected matter from supernova explosions dissipate parental intra - cluster gas .",
    "if kinetic energy of the stars exceeds the remaining gravitational potential then the cluster quickly dilutes the primordial assembly into the stellar galactic field .",
    "only @xmath2% of the number of original clusters seem to survive the so - called  infant mortality \" and remain bound for longer than @xmath3  gyr @xcite .",
    "surviving stellar clusters are suffering processes of partial destruction and dissipation during their whole life , whose true nature and details are still matter of debate although several global scenarios have been proposed in the last years ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . tidal galactic field and encounters with giant molecular clouds are two main mechanisms responsible for the dissipation and disruption of stellar clusters , but the total lifetime of these systems and the rate at which they are loosing stars are very dependent on cluster initial conditions @xcite and on the main destruction mechanism ;",
    "for example , it has been shown that a star cluster can be disrupted even by a single tidal encounter with a giant molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "thus , initial mass , spatial distribution of zero - age stars , galactic location and local environment of the birth place affect the dynamical evolution of stellar clusters for the first several hundred million years @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that most embedded clusters , as well as some intermediate - age systems which have already lost their parental gas component , may exhibit a clumpy structure formed by several connected blobs or filaments @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution of stars in these clusters can be described as a fractal pattern and quantified by a single parameter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it seems that the original clumpy structure in some clusters tends to be erased with age giving rise to radial density profiles , although clusters as old as @xmath4  myr may still present fractal patterns @xcite .",
    "however , there exist a number of different possible morphologies and alternative scenarios have been proposed in which structurally simple clusters are built up through hierarchical merging of smaller subclusters @xcite .",
    "thus , a key question is whether the clumpy internal structure observed in some clusters is just the imprint of the parental gas cloud , a signature that tends to disappear over time , or whether new blobs can be generated and/or maintained during the cluster dynamical evolution . a suitable strategy to address",
    "this problem is to find clusters having evidence of internal clumpiness and then collect and analyse in detail the spatial and kinematic information available for them .",
    "galactic open clusters showing signatures of spatial substructure have been previously detected and analysed .",
    "most examples refer to young ( @xmath5  myr ) clusters whose structure can be mainly attributed to their original clouds @xcite , for instance , ngc  1333 @xcite and ngc  2264 @xcite .",
    "intermediate age ( a few times @xmath6  myr ) open clusters with clear evidence of spatial substructures include ngc  2287 , ngc  2516 and ngc  2548 @xcite .",
    "irregular patterns have been also observed in old ( @xmath7  gyr ) clusters like m67 @xcite and recently in ngc  6791 @xcite .",
    "the irregular overdensities observed in intermediate - age and old clusters are interpreted as associated with real structures stretched by the galactic potential field @xcite , but the details of this mechanism can only be fully evaluated through an accurate analysis of the kinematics of cluster members on a large spatial scale to compare core and halo dynamics .",
    "the search of patterns or substructures in the velocity phase space requires further improvement both in specific searching tools ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) and in the precision of the kinematic data .",
    "precise radial velocity measurements have allowed to resolve clumpy structures in four clusters : ngc  2264 @xcite , orion nebula cluster @xcite , gamma velorum @xcite and ngc  2547 @xcite .",
    "there is not , to our knowledge , any reported evidence of grouping or patterns in the proper motion subspace .    from the above mentioned clusters , ngc  2548",
    "is contained in the _ carte du ciel _ - san fernando ( cdc - sf ) astrometric catalogue @xcite .",
    "the cdc - sf catalogue presents some advantages over proper motion data currently available for this cluster .",
    "it contains precise measurements ( @xmath8  mas  yr@xmath9 for stars to v@xmath1016 and @xmath11  mas  yr@xmath9 for v@xmath1014 ) which means a deeper extension of hipparcos , in terms of proper motions , up to a magnitude of 14 . in this work we use these data to study the properties of ngc  2548 , both in spatial coordinates and in proper - motion space .",
    "ngc  2548 ( m48 ) is a well known open cluster with many studies since the second half of xx century providing extensive knowledge of its main physical properties .",
    "it is located in the third galactic quadrant with coordinates @xmath12h @xmath13 m @xmath14s and @xmath15 @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "the latest studies generally agree on a distance value in the range @xmath17  pc , a very low reddening @xmath18 and nearly solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "the most recent age estimation , based on stellar rotation periods , yielded @xmath19  myr @xcite in well agreement with previously determined isochrone ages @xcite .",
    "this cluster is specially suitable for dynamical evolution studies because of its internal clumpy structure formed by three well differentiated blobs ( see fig .  5 in * ?",
    "* ) , but the available kinematic data suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks : ( a ) small number of data points , ( b ) limited to relatively bright stars , ( c ) partial covering of the cluster area and ( d ) large proper motion uncertainties . by using data from the cdc - sf catalogue , we are able to overcome these issues and to carry out a detailed analysis of the internal structure of ngc  2548 . this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : sample ] describes the observational data used in this work .",
    "cluster memberships are derived in section  [ sec : members ] and then used to calculate the spatial and kinematic distribution of stars in section  [ sec : maps ] .",
    "these results are discussed in section  [ sec : discussion ] in the context of the dynamical evolution of star clusters .",
    "finally , the main conclusions are summarised in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "we use the cdc - sf astrometric catalogue @xcite which provides precise positions and proper motions for stars up to a magnitude of v@xmath1016 .",
    "the mean positional uncertainty is @xmath20  arcsec ( @xmath21  arcsec for well - measured stars ) and the proper motion uncertainty is @xmath22  mas  yr@xmath9 ( @xmath23  mas  yr@xmath9 for well - measured stars ) . for extracting the data from this catalogue we choose a circle centred on the cluster",
    "coordinates given by @xcite , @xmath24  deg and @xmath25  deg , that we will assume as the cluster centre in this work .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , a proper choice of the sampling radius is crucial to avoid some biases and problems determining memberships and , therefore , the remaining cluster properties .",
    "we tried to follow the recipe suggested in @xcite , based on analysing memberships for several sample radii , but given the irregular space and velocity distributions of stars in this cluster ( see next sections ) this has not been possible . in any case , the optimal sampling radius nearly coincides with the cluster radius itself @xcite ; however , it is rather unreliable to estimate this radius from the cluster members available in the literature because , independently of the used method , assigned members tend to spread throughout the area selected by the author .",
    "this fact produces discrepancies in the derived radius values . from the projected radial density of stars it is possible to estimate the  tidal \" radius as the point where the radial density becomes roughly constant and merges with the field star density . in this way",
    ", tidal radius values ranging from @xmath26  arcmin @xcite to @xmath27  arcmin @xcite have been reported .",
    "we have calculated the surface density of stars ( fig .",
    "[ fig : perfil ] ) from which we obtain @xmath28  arcmin as the optimal sampling radius . with this radius",
    "we extract positions and proper motions for the stars in the cdc - sf catalogue in the direction centred at the ngc  2548 coordinates .",

    "our main result is the finding that each substructure observed in the spatial distribution of stars in ngc  2548 has its well differentiated counterpart in the proper motion space , which provides the first _",
    "kinematic _ evidence of cluster disruption occurring in this stellar system . as far as we know , this is the first detection of a clumpy structure in the proper motion space in any star cluster . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the spatial clumpy structure observed in ngc  2548 is likely a consequence of its interaction with the galactic gravitational field .",
    "as clusters move on their orbits through the milky way , they will pass several times through the galactic disk and they may become morphologically disturbed or even destroyed due to the galactic tidal forces @xcite .",
    "successive passes through the galactic plane can speed up the destruction of clusters , although the ease with which they can be destroyed depends on variables such as the initial mass function or the initial virial state , and the expected disruption time - scale varies from less than @xmath4  myr up to the order of @xmath31  gyr @xcite .",
    "other possible disruption mechanisms , such as close encounters with giant molecular clouds , do not seem to be as effective as galactic tides in disrupting open cluster @xcite .",
    "( right panel ) showing the higher density isocontours and positions of cores c1 , c2 and a. solid arrows represent the proper motions of the cores relative to the global proper motion of the cluster derived in section  [ sec : members ] .",
    "reference arrow in upper right corner has a length of @xmath3  mas  yr@xmath9 .",
    "dashed arrows indicate axes parallel ( @xmath32 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath33 ) to the galactic plane , respectively . ]",
    "the relative spatial configuration of the three internal cores in ngc  2548 suggests a predominant interaction with galactic forces .",
    "figure  [ fig : paladiscu ] shows the spatial distribution of the cores , also indicating their proper motions relative to the cluster centroid and the directions perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane .",
    "the stretching of c1-c2 is nearly parallel to the galactic plane , which is consistent with the flattening in the same direction predicted in numerical simulations @xcite . on the other hand , clump",
    "a is located relatively far from the main cores at @xmath34  pc in the direction of the galactic plane .",
    "this was interpreted by @xcite as a being a remnant of the last disk - shocking of ngc  2548 .",
    "note that a s proper motion relative to the cluster centroid ( black arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig : paladiscu ] ) goes towards the galactic plane and away from the rest of the cluster .",
    "nevertheless , it must be pointed out that it is not possible to be sure about the real nature of clump a. given that it is a weak overdensity with few members and it seems to be detached from the main cluster ( cores c1-c2 ) , a random concentration of field stars is also a plausible explanation for the origin of this clump .",
    "however , we should note that we are not estimating spatial overdensities from the full star sample without any rigorous membership analysis ( as in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but after a reliable kinematic membership assignment .",
    "the fact that clump a is inside our estimated cluster radius together with the fact that its presence is robust against the kinematic pruning of the data point toward a real star clump moving away from the central part .",
    "there is still the alternative possibility that clump a is a small spatial overdensity of stars but lying at some distance behind ngc  2548 .",
    "this alternative is supported by the , on average , fainter magnitudes of their stars but , in this case , the kinematic similarities have to be interpreted as happening by chance . if we take as true that a is a clump that has been separated from the original cluster by tidal forces , then the kinematic solutions are consistent because a goes away from the rest of the cluster due to its last pass through the galactic disk .",
    "the challenge in this case is to understand why the core a is on average less luminous than c1-c2 .",
    "there must have been some mass - segregation episode either associated with the dynamical disruption itself or with a primordial mass - segregated pattern .",
    "there are many open clusters showing elongations or other shape distortions @xcite . for a very young open cluster ,",
    "its morphological structure is likely determined by the initial conditions in the parental cloud @xcite ; but for dynamically evolved clusters , external tidal perturbations would become increasingly important .",
    "in fact , cluster properties such as size or flattening seem to correlate with distances to the galactic centre and plane probably because these variables define the degree of tidal stress @xcite .",
    "it would be necessary to extend this type of analysis to large samples of disrupting star cluster candidates ( as , for instance , those in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "gaia data will be particularly useful for this because it will measure very precise proper motion values even for low - mass members in open clusters . in this work",
    ", we were able to detect kinematic substructures because of our relatively precise proper motions ( mean error @xmath35  mas  yr@xmath9 , four times better than ucac4 ) , but gaia expected mean errors are @xmath36  mas  yr@xmath9 ( about ten times smaller than ours ) or even @xmath37  mas  yr@xmath9 for bright stars with @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "moreover , gaia will also provide radial velocities that make it possible to derive reliable three - dimensional space velocities .",
    "this will allow to perform detailed statistical studies to better understand the cluster destruction processes and how they depend on cluster environmental properties such as galactic location and orbit .",
    "we have used precise astrometric data from the cdc - sf catalogue to analyse the spatial and kinematic structure of the open cluster ngc  2548 . from the spatial distribution of reliable cluster members we confirm its previously reported fragmented structure consisting of three separated cores ( denoted as c1 , c2 and a ) but , for the first time",
    ", we also distinguish the corresponding blobs in the proper motion space .",
    "the two main cores c1 and c2 are aligned nearly parallel to the galactic plane whereas the fainter and less dense core a moves toward the plane and appears to be detaching itself from the rest of the cluster .",
    "we present the derived core properties in table  [ tab : cores ] .",
    "this clumpy spatial and kinematical structure observed in ngc  2548 could be consequence of the galactic gravitational field , in particular due to its last crossing through the galactic plane .",
