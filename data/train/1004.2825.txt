    "the study of the decays of @xmath8 mesons is important and interesting for the determination of the flavor parameters of the standard model ( sm ) , the exploration of @xmath9 violation , the search of new physics beyond sm , etc . in recent years",
    ", theoretical studies of @xmath10 mesons have been investigated widely in the literatures .",
    "they are tested and supported by the experimental data collected by the detectors at the @xmath11 colliders , such as the cleo , babar , and belle . with the bright hope arising from the startup of the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite ,",
    "the heavier @xmath12 and @xmath6 mesons could be produced abundantly and studied in detail at the hadron colliders .",
    "it is estimated that one could expect around @xmath13 @xmath14 @xmath15 `` self - tagging '' @xmath6 events per year at the lhc @xcite due to a relatively large production cross section @xcite plus the huge luminosity @xmath16",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "there seems to exist a real possibility to study not only some @xmath6 rare decays , but also @xmath9 violation and polarization asymmetries .",
    "the study of the @xmath6 mesons will highlight the advantages of @xmath8 physics .",
    "the @xmath6 mesons are the `` double heavy - flavored '' binding systems and share many features with the heavy quarkonia .",
    "the first observation of the @xmath6 mesons at the tevatron @xcite provokes the physicist s particular interest in them .",
    "many studies and investigation of the properties of the @xmath6 mesons have been made , and will be further scrutinized by the lhc experiments . because the @xmath6 mesons lie below the @xmath20 threshold ( here we only discuss the lightest @xmath21 ground state pseudoscalar @xmath6 mesons , excluding their excited states ) and carry flavors , they can not annihilate into gluon and/or photon so are stable for the strong and/or electromagnetic interaction . because of the flavor quantum numbers @xmath8 @xmath17 @xmath22 @xmath17 @xmath23 , the @xmath6 mesons can decay through the weak interaction only .",
    "the @xmath6 mesons have more decay modes than the @xmath24 mesons due to several reasons .",
    "one is that many decay modes , such as @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath24 @xmath25 @xmath26 , are only accessible by @xmath6 mesons because of their sufficiently large masses .",
    "another is that the @xmath6 mesons carry open flavors , so either @xmath27 or @xmath28 quarks can decay individually .",
    "the potential decays of the @xmath6 mesons permit us to over - constrain quantities determined by the @xmath24 meson decays .",
    "the decays of @xmath6 mesons can be divided into three classes : ( 1 ) the @xmath27-quark decay ( i.e. @xmath27 @xmath1 @xmath29 , where the up - type quark @xmath29 @xmath17 @xmath30 , @xmath28 ) accompanied with the spectator @xmath28-quark , ( 2 ) the @xmath28-quark decay ( i.e. @xmath28 @xmath1 @xmath31 , where the down - type quark @xmath31 @xmath17 @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) accompanied with the spectator @xmath27-quark , and ( 3 ) the annihilation channel ( i.e. @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath34 , @xmath35 , where the lepton @xmath36 @xmath17 @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 ) . among the multitudinous",
    "@xmath6 decays , the weak annihilation channels are expected to take @xmath4 @xmath40 shares according to the estimates in @xcite for which a major part comes from the tree weak annihilation process @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath41 which is not helicity - suppressed because of the large charm quark mass and produces a large weak annihilation branching ratio with charm in the final state , while the charmless pure weak annihilation decay @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 is helicity - suppressed like the @xmath42 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay and would have a very small branching ratio .",
    "it is highly expected that the lhc experiments might shed light on a better understanding of weak annihilation processes for @xmath6 mesons .    in recent years",
    ", several attractive methods have been proposed to study the nonleptonic @xmath8 decays , such as the qcd factorization ( qcdf ) @xcite , perturbative qcd method ( pqcd ) @xcite , soft and collinear effective theory @xcite , etc .",
    "here , we would like to investigate the charmless pure weak annihilation @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay with the pqcd approach due to several reasons .",
    "( 1 ) one reason is that fits of nonleptonic charmless decays @xmath10 @xmath1 @xmath43 , @xmath44 without taking into account weak annihilation contributions are generally of poor quality @xcite ( here @xmath45 and @xmath46 denote the lightest ground pseudoscalar and vector mesons , respectively ) .",
    "our present understanding of the weak annihilation contributions remains limited and unclear .",
    "so the pure weak annihilation processes , such as @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decays , are interesting and worthy of study , which will certainly help us to improve our understanding of the weak annihilation contributions .",
    "( 2 ) another is that due to both kinematic improvement from the large phase spaces and dynamic enhancement of the ckm factor @xmath47 , the @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay is expected to have a large branching ratio among two - body nonleptonic charmless @xmath48-annihilation @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath43 processes .",
    "in addition to the absence of penguin operators for the tree annihilation process @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 , final state interactions arising from soft gluon exchanges are expected to be extremely small because of the large momenta of the final @xmath49 mesons .",
    "therefore a relatively accurate estimation of annihilation contributions could be obtained effectively from the charmless @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay .",
    "still another is that ref.@xcite obtains a very large @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 branching ratio , about @xmath50 , at @xmath51 orders of magnitude bigger than the estimate @xmath52 of ref.@xcite , but this estimate is not valid because ref.@xcite in their calculation incorrectly uses the measured penguin - dominated @xmath53 branching ratio while the decay @xmath6",
    "@xmath1 @xmath7 is a pure tree weak annihilation and should be related to @xmath42 @xmath1 @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , the branching ratio of the charmless decay @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 is estimated to be @xmath54 with the qcdf approach @xcite . recently",
    ", this charmless decay is also studied with the pqcd approach and its branching ratio is @xmath5 with the off - mass - shell final states @xcite , which is the same order of magnitude as ours obtained in this paper with the on - shell final states .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec2 ] , we will discuss the theoretical framework and give the decay amplitudes for @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 with the perturbative qcd approach . in our calculation",
    ", we shall ignore the final state interactions because the final states have very large momenta and move far away before soft gluon exchange .",
    "section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the numerical result of the branching ratio .",
    "finally , we summarize in section [ sec4 ] .",
    "for convenience , the kinematics variables are described in the terms of the light cone coordinate .",
    "the momenta of the valence quarks and hadrons in the rest frame of the @xmath6 meson are defined by @xmath65 where @xmath66 @xmath17 @xmath67 .",
    "the null vectors @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the plus and minus directions , respectively .",
    "@xmath70 is the momentum of @xmath28 quark in the @xmath6 meson .",
    "@xmath71 and @xmath72 are the momenta of the light non - strange quark in the @xmath73 and @xmath74 mesons , respectively .",
    "@xmath75 denotes the transverse momentum .",
    "@xmath76 denotes the longitudinal momentum fraction of the valence quark .",
    "the calculation of the hadronic matrix elements is difficult due to the nonperturbative effects arising from the strong interactions .",
    "phenomenologically , using the brodsky - lepage approach @xcite , a modified perturbative qcd formalism has been proposed recently under the @xmath77 factorization framework @xcite . taking into account the transverse momentum of the valence quarks in the hadrons ,",
    "the sudakov factors are introduced to modify the endpoint behavior of the hadronic matrix elements .",
    "the amplitudes are factorized into three convolution parts : the `` harder '' functions , the heavy quark decay subamplitudes , and the nonperturbative meson wave functions , which are characterized by the @xmath78 boson mass @xmath79 , the typical scale @xmath80 of the decay processes , and the hadronic scale @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the pqcd approach has been extensively applied to study semileptonic and nonleptonic @xmath8 decays with phenomenological results .",
    "more information about pqcd approach can be found in @xcite .",
    "the final decay amplitudes can be expressed as @xmath82 where the wilson coefficient @xmath83 is calculated in perturbative theory at the scale of @xmath79 and evolved down to the typical scale @xmath80 using the rg equations .",
    "@xmath84 denotes the convolution over parton kinematic variables .",
    "@xmath85 is the hard - scattering subamplitude which is dominated by hard gluon exchange and can be factorized .",
    "the universal wave functions @xmath86 absorb nonperturbative long - distance dynamics , which can be extracted from experiments or constrained by lattice calculation and qcd sum rules .",
    "@xmath27 is the conjugate variable of the transverse momentum of the valence quark of the meson .",
    "according to the arguments in @xcite , the amplitude of eq.([eq : am01 ] ) is free from the renormalization scale dependence .      within the pqcd framework , the long - distance hadronic information is contained by the the so - called light - cone distribution amplitudes ( lcdas ) which are defined from hadron - to - vacuum matrix elements of nonlocal bilinear operators .",
    "although lcdas are not calculable in qcd perturbation theory , some of their properties are well understood for both light and heavy mesons .",
    "for example , the lcdas for the @xmath49 meson including higher - twist contributions are systematically presented in @xcite . in our calculation , we only consider two - particle ( valence quarks ) twist-2 and twist-3 lcdas for @xmath49 mesons , and neglect contributions from higher fock states .",
    "the lcdas for @xmath49 mesons are written as @xmath87\\big\\}_{{\\beta}{\\alpha}}\\ ] ] where @xmath88 is the color number .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 is the chiral factor @xmath89 @xmath17 @xmath90 .",
    "the null vector @xmath91 and @xmath92 are parallel to @xmath93 and @xmath94 , respectively .",
    "the expressions of the twist-2 lcdas @xmath95 and the twist-3 lcdas @xmath96 , @xmath97 are collected in appendix [ app01 ] .",
    "unlike the @xmath98 and @xmath49 mesons , our knowledge of the lcdas for @xmath6 mesons has been relatively poor until recently ( for a recent view , see @xcite ) , but we know that the @xmath6 mesons are composed of heavy valence quark both @xmath27 and @xmath28 . given @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101",
    "@xmath25 @xmath102 , the @xmath6 mesons can be described approximately by nonrelativistic dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we will take @xmath103_{{\\beta}{\\alpha } } ,   \\label{eq : wf - bc-01}\\ ] ] where @xmath104 is the decay constant of the @xmath6 meson .",
    "as the arguments in @xcite , this simplest form , @xmath105 @xmath17 @xmath106 , is the two - particle nonrelativistic lcdas at the tree level where both heavy valence",
    "quarks just share the total momentum of the @xmath6 mesons according to their masses . for a rough estimation of the branching ratio for @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay",
    ", we will take the simplest form as an approximation , and neglect the relativistic corrections and contributions from higher fock states .",
    "the branching ratio in the @xmath6 meson rest frame can be written as : @xmath123 where @xmath93 is the center - of - mass momentum of @xmath49 mesons .",
    "the lifetime and mass of the @xmath6 meson are @xmath99 @xmath17 @xmath124 @xmath125 @xmath126 gev and @xmath127 @xmath17 @xmath128 ps @xcite , respectively . other input parameters are @xmath129 if not specified explicitly , we shall take their central values as the default input .",
    "the numerical result of the branching ratio is @xmath130{\\times }      [ 1{\\pm}0.3\\%(\\hbox{ckm}){\\pm}1.6\\%(f_{b_{c}}){\\pm}3.7\\%(f_{k } ) ]      { \\times}10^{-7},\\ ] ] where the errors come from the uncertainties of quark masses @xmath101 and @xmath102 , the ckm factor @xmath57 , and the decay constants @xmath104 and @xmath131 .",
    "the largest error arises from the parameter of @xmath101 , which can reach @xmath132 .",
    "the errors arising from both the ckm factor and the decay constants are relatively small .",
    "of course , there are some other uncertainties not considered here , such as the radiative corrections to the lcdas of @xmath6 mesons , the final states interactions , etc .",
    "so the results might just be an estimation of the pqcd approach .",
    "our estimation of the branching ratio @xmath3 is slightly different with the result in @xcite , although they are calculated with the same pqcd approach resulting in the same order of magnitude @xmath5 . besides the input parameters",
    ", the reasons may be ( 1 ) whether the final states are on - mass - shell or not , and ( 2 ) whether the contributions of factorizable topologies are zero or not . with appropriate input parameters ,",
    "the results in @xcite and ours are in agreement with each other within an error range .    as the arguments in @xcite , the inconsistencies among various estimations of the branching ratio @xmath3 , such as @xmath52 based on @xmath42 annihilation by using the relations among the charmless weak annihilation @xmath6 decay channels relying on the @xmath63 flavor symmetry @xcite",
    ", @xmath5 ( or @xmath54 @xcite ) based on perturbative one - gluon exchange with the pqcd ( or qcdf ) approach , arise from conceptually different methods .",
    "anyway , for weak annihilation to light quarks in the final state , the tree annihilation @xmath0 @xmath1 @xmath133 process is helicity suppressed because of small light quark masses , so that gluon emission either from the initial or final state must occur in this annihilation and the decay amplitude is then @xmath134 as given in pqcd .",
    "both the estimations in @xcite and our result are in accordance with an intuitive expectation for nonleptonic charmless @xmath48-annihilation of heavy meson decays which are usually suppressed .",
    "there are some additional factors for the tiny estimation of @xmath3 .",
    "one the is that although the @xmath135 decay is a tree weak annihilation process , its amplitude is color suppressed and associated with @xmath136 .",
    "another is that there is a large destructive interference between the nonfactorizable topologies due to the near equal final state particle masses .",
    "this can be clearly found in eq.([eq : amplitude ] ) .",
    "the numerical results also confirm the cancellation between the nonfactorizable topologies , and give the strong phases @xmath4 @xmath137 and @xmath4 @xmath138 for fig.[fig1 ] ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "if the pqcd prediction is right , then there should be some @xmath139 events for @xmath135 decay per year at the lhc .",
    "considering the detection efficiency and selection efficiency , there would be just a few events per year .",
    "the signal of the pure weak annihilation @xmath135 decay would be very tiny at the lhc .",
    "as @xmath8 nonleptonic charmless decays , the charmless pure weak annihilation is expected to be small in @xmath6 nonleptonic decays , so the lhc measurement could confirm our understanding of the annihilation terms in weak decays based on perturbative qcd .",
    "in this paper , we study the @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay with the pqcd approach , which would call for another reassessment of the weak annihilation processes and might provide some valuable hints of our understanding on perturbative qcd and long - distance contributions .",
    "it is found that the contributions of factorizable annihilation topologies are zero , and that there is a large cancellation between the nonfactorizable topologies , which result in the branching ratio @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the branching ratio with the pqcd approach is so tiny that the @xmath6 @xmath1 @xmath7 decay might not be measured at the lhc experiments .",
