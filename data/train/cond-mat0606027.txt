    "has been found as early as 1980,@xcite but only recently the non - equilibrium phenomena have started to be studied in this class of materials .",
    "aging is a rather frequent phenomenon with various possible causes , but rejuvenation and especially memory are considered as peculiar of the frozen spin glass state,@xcite and theoretical models for them rely on a proliferation of hierarchically organized metastable states below a glass transition temperature,@xcite or the vanishing of the barriers between these metastable states above a temperature @xmath4.@xcite memory is therefore expected to vanish above @xmath4 , but it has been observed also above that temperature in few systems : in the magnetic perovskite y@xmath11ca@xmath12mno@xmath0 , which presents an unusual state of short - range ferromagnetic order before freezing into a canonical spin glass state;@xcite in the relaxor ferroelectric ( pb / la)(zr / ti)o@xmath0 ( plzt)@xcite and to some extent in pb(mg@xmath13nb@xmath14)@xmath15ti@xmath16o@xmath0 ( pmn - pt)@xcite but not in pmn.ccw01 a detailed study@xcite showed that the memory recovery of aging stages at a temperature @xmath17 becomes anomalously high when @xmath17 approaches @xmath4 from below and remains high above @xmath4 in plzt , instead of vanishing as in pmn or in spin glasses ; for this reason , _ _  _ _ it was proposed that high - temperature aging below and above @xmath4 in plzt are of different nature , the latter possibly being related to mobile defects like oxygen vacancies .  indeed , such defects are held responsible for the closely related phenomena of fatigue and domain wall clamping in ferroelectrics,@xcite which also involve a slow decrease of the dielectric susceptibility . on the other hand , we showed@xcite that plzt has even memory of _ multiple _ aging stages above @xmath4 .",
    "memory of multiple aging stages has never been observed  and probably not looked for  outside a canonical spin glass@xcite and possibly superparamagnetic@xcite state ; therefore , its presence is already an indication that in plzt some mechanism of hierarchically organized correlations intrinsic of the relaxor state is involved also above the relaxor transition , rather than marginally mobile defects.@xcite still , in the absence of a quantitative model for the contribution of mobile defects on aging and memory , the possibility can not be excluded that defects are the cause of such non equilibrium phenomena above @xmath4 , also because o  defects up to few tenths of molar percent may arise from the compensation of unavoidable deviations from the ideal cation stoichiometry .",
    "it is our purpose here to study the influence of o  vacancies and h impurities on aging and memory in the region near and above @xmath4 in plzt , since these are the only defects whose mobility might produce relaxation effects with characteristic times of the order of hours or days at such temperatures ( 300 - 400  k ) . in fact , o is by far more mobile than the cations , with an activation energy for diffusion of @xmath18  ev in titanate perovskites,@xcite and the only possible o defect is a vacancy , since there would not be room enough for interstitial o in the closely packed perovskite structure .",
    "hydrogen may enter as ( oh)@xmath19 ion substituting an o vacancy and its diffusion barrier is even lower.@xcite regarding the off - centre ionic displacements , they are fully responsible for the dielectric and relaxor properties of these materials and can not be considered as extrinsic defects affecting memory .",

    "the aim of these experiments is to evaluate the possible contribution of extrinsic defects to the memory of aging stages found in the relaxor plzt 9/65/35 also near and above the freezing temperature @xmath4 .",

    "these authors found that pmn behaves like a canonical spin glass , with its memory of an aging stage at @xmath17 vanishing when @xmath17 approaches @xmath112 from below .",
    "instead , the memory of plzt 9/65/35 has an initial decrease with a minimum around @xmath114 and then rises again to 80%  at @xmath112 , remaining high up to @xmath115 .",
    "the comparison of the memory recovery versus @xmath17 in pmn and plzt together with the above considerations indeed suggests that a different mechanism exists above @xmath4 in plzt , which the authors identify with mobile defects .    to our knowledge , the only defects whose mobility may be high enough to match with the temperature and characteristic times of these aging experiments are :  mobile charges ( electrons or holes )  from ionized defects , o  vacancies and hydrogen , generally associated in the form of ( oh)@xmath19 ion in perovskites.@xcite in the present study , we tested all these possibilities .    the reference relaxor composition has a rather clear - cut behavior , typical of spin - glasses:@xcite almost overlapping cooling and heating reference @xmath7 curves , with no frequency dependence in the low - temperature @xmath116 and high - temperature @xmath82 ( fig .",
    "[ fig diel96535 ] ) , complete rejuvenation on cooling , heating curves with substantial or complete memory recovery and good matching with the reference far from @xmath17 ; in addition , one day aging is sufficient to imprint a complete ( fig .",
    "[ fig annorm96535]a ) or almost complete ( fig .",
    "[ fig mem96535 ] ) memory of the aging stage .",
    "the only peculiarity is that memory exists both below and above @xmath4 .",
    "now , if the high temperature memory were almost completely due to defects , it should be considerably enhanced after reduction in h@xmath38 .",
    "in fact , such a treatment introduced at least @xmath42 o vacancies per formula unit , as deduced from the mass loss , and most likely also h defects , whose amount we can not evaluate ; as a result , the sample turned from white - yellow to dark grey and an extremely intense thermally activated relaxation process appeared in the high temperature side of @xmath80 , presumably due the motion of charges from the new ionized defects .",
    "the reduced sample therefore contains a substantially larger amount of all the mobile defects considered before , with respect to the standard oxygenated state . the effect on the memory recovery of high temperature aging , however , is negligible in the dielectric case ( 2% increase , fig .",
    "[ fig memdielvo ] ) and consists in a depression of over 10% in the anelastic one ( fig .",
    "[ fig annorm96535 ] ) ; note that during the anelastic experiment aging has been done at a temperature 50  k lower than in the dielectric one , and this should be the main reason for the larger initial memory recovery and larger loss after reduction .    regarding the differences between the dielectric and anelastic measurements , it can be observed that the dynamic compliance @xmath62 probes quadrupolar strain fluctuations , while the dielectric susceptibility probes dipolar polarization fluctuations , and therefore the @xmath63 and @xmath62 curves may differ.@xcite in principle , there may be relaxation modes appearing in @xmath117 and not in @xmath63 and _ vice versa _ , _ _",
    "_ _ but in practice there is correlation between strain and polarization fluctuations .",
    "for example , in a perfect crystal the inversion of an electric dipole causes no change in strain ( which is centrosymmetric ) , while rotations of the o octahedra cause strain but no polarization changes ; in a disordered crystal like plzt , however , there are no pure inversions of dipoles or pure rotations of octahedra , and different modes are coupled together.@xcite we do not know whether , between anelastic and dielectric responses , one is more significant than the other for studying nonequilibrium processes . certainly , the dielectric response is more directly related to the dipolar interactions , which presumably govern the dynamics of relaxor ferroelectrics ; on the other hand , the anelastic response truly probes the bulk and is insensitive to mobile charges , unlike @xmath63 in reduced or defective samples.@xcite    in the second part of the experiment , we tested the composition plztn 7/60/40 , which , although very close to plzt 9/65/35 , presents differences with respect to the non - equilibrium phenomena : _",
    "i ) _ plzt 9/65/35 supports a full relaxor state and in the standard oxygenated state has no detectable extrinsic mobile defects , like o  vacancies ; _ ii ) _ plztn 7/60/40 presents both relaxor - like susceptibility maximum and , below @xmath118 370  k , weak ferroelectric properties and should have about 2%of o vacancies in order to balance the cation charge ( see experimental ) . therefore , besides having a large amount of defects , plztn 7/60/40 starts developing ferroelectric domains below @xmath111 ; if anomalous memory phenomena may arise from mobile defects interacting with polar nanodomains and/or more developed ferroelectric domains , then such phenomena should be particularly well developed in plztn 7/60/40 .",
    "again , the experiment shows that this is not case ; rather , the non equilibrium processes related to the relaxor state and to mobile defects have quite different phenomenologies and time scales .",
    "figure [ fig shortaging ] shows that the memory of an aging stage of 21  h at @xmath119 350  k is drastically lower than in the full relaxor case : the value of @xmath17 is included between those of the dielectric and anelastic aging experiments in plzt 9/65/35 , so that defects have the same mobility in all the experiments ; still , even though cooling is extended only to 35  k below @xmath17 , compared to the 100  k of the previous cases , the memory recovery is less than 30% .",
    "in addition , when the formation of ferroelectric domains , although small and disordered , starts , the behavior on cooling and heating is far less reproducible than in the relaxor case .",
    "figure [ fig longaging ] shows the effect of extending cooling down to 230  k , as in the experiments with plzt 9/65/35 , after longer aging stages at room temperature : a 13 days aging causes a marked decrease of both @xmath66 and @xmath120 , but negligible memory on heating .",
    "this demonstrates that the combination of small or even more developed ferroelectric domains and mobile defects , although causes aging , is not able to create the memory effects found in the relaxor state .",
    "rather , the slow reorientation and migration of o vacancies within the strain and electric fields of ferroelectric domains may be responsible for the memory imprinting on the much longer time scale of months ( triangles in fig .",
    "fig longaging ) .",
    "the closely related phenomena of domain wall clamping@xcite and formation of internal fields@xcite from mobile defects adapting themselves to domains are known to occur in ferroelectrics.dam98      it remains to be explained how is it possible that in plzt memory of even multiple aging stages , as also shown in previous work,@xcite may occur above the temperature of the maximum in the susceptibility .",
    "the reason for this behavior may reside in the fact that , unlike spin glasses , the polar degrees of freedom in relaxor ferroelectrics freeze out of an already partially correlated state .",
    "in fact , relaxor ferroelectrics are characterized by the burns temperature @xmath121 , below which the formation of polar nanoclusters starts;@xcite therefore , the state below @xmath122 is a sort of supeparaelectric one , and the analogy between relaxors and magnetic systems is probably more appropriate with strongly correlated superparamagnets rather than with canonical spin - glasses , where the dynamics above @xmath4 is that of individual spins , although interacting .",
    "indeed , the magnetic perovskite y@xmath11ca@xmath12mno@xmath43 , presents a spin glass state preceded by short - range ferromagnetic order , reminiscent of the polar nanoclusters of relaxors , and also exhibits memory above the spin glass transition.@xcite the authors found this behavior unusual and were not able to classify it according to any available theory , but suggested that it may be related to the phase - separated nature of manganites . in ferroelectric relaxors",
    "no electronic phase separation occurs , but certainly the analogy with y@xmath11ca@xmath12mno@xmath0 suggests that highly correlated and hierarchically organized states may arise also from the interactions among the polar or magnetic clusters , which on further cooling freeze into the relaxor or spin - glass state . it should be remarked that , in order to explain memory , the need of hierarchical or at least strongly correlated dynamics , opposed to simple broad distribution of relaxation times , is not only indicated by the available theoretical models , but also by experiments on superparamagnets .",
    "magnetic nanoparticle systems can be made with a controlled distribution of particle sizes and with different degrees of dipolar interaction among the particles .",
    "it is therefore possible to obtain slow dynamics in systems ranging between two limits : _",
    "i ) _ weakly interacting particles with a broad distribution of individual relaxation times , due to a broad distribution of their sizes , and _",
    "ii ) _ strongly interacting particles with collective dynamics .",
    "both limits exhibit various forms of non - equilibrium dynamics below some blocking temperature @xmath123 , which from the phenomenological point of view corresponds to @xmath4 in spin - glasses .",
    "even systems belonging to the first category may exhibit some kind of memory ; memory of multiple aging stages has been found in the dc magnetization of weakly interacting superparamagnets,@xcite where the @xmath124 curve on heating retraces , although smoothly , the steps formed during previous field cooling with aging stages at zero field .",
    "it has been remarked , however , that such a behavior can be completely accounted for in terms of broad distribution of relaxation times , and that these systems lack memory in the ac susceptibility under zero field.zgx05 instead , memory in zero field cooled experiments can be found only in strongly interacting superparamagnets , also called superspin glasses.sjt05 the analogy between relaxor plzt and superspin glasses , however , is not straightforward , since the latter exhibit aging and memory below a blocking temperature that is the equivalent of @xmath4 in spin glasses , and we are not aware of experiments in such systems where it has been verified that these phenomena occur also above the temperature of the maxima in the ac susceptibilities .    a  successful attempt in modeling aging and memory in the dynamic susceptibility has been made by sasaki and nemoto,@xcite through the multi - layer random energy model ; the main hypothesis is that the states of the system are hierarchically organized into `` layers '' , where the @xmath52-th layer contains states that can access the @xmath125-th layer by overcoming energy barriers @xmath126 distributed according to @xmath127 , with @xmath128 and @xmath129 . in this manner",
    "it is possible to reproduce by numerical simulation memory effects in @xmath130 during aging stages below @xmath131",
    ". it would be interesting to also know the shapes of the @xmath7 curves resulting from this model , in order to correlate the maximum temperature at which memory is found with the maxima in @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath7 in the limiting case of a single layer can be analytically approximated,@xcite and has been used to describe the susceptibility of pmn - pt , but does not describe plzt;@xcite in this case the maxima of @xmath7 are above @xmath132 .",
    "the purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether mobile defects , mainly o  vacancies , interacting with polar nanoclusters or microdomains might be the origin of the memory in the susceptibility curves versus temperature of aging stages also above the relaxor transition ; both dielectric susceptibility and elastic compliance have been tested .    in one experiment , we started from the well - behaved relaxor composition plzt 9/65/35 , presenting from 80% to full memory recovery of aging stages both in the dielectric and elastic curves , and introduced all conceivable types of extrinsic mobile defects :  o vacancies , hydrogen defects and free charges from the ionized defects .",
    "as a result , the memory was almost unaffected or depressed , excluding that such defects are the main responsible for the high - temperature memory .    in another experiment we tested plztn 7/60/40",
    ", whose composition is very close to plzt 9/65/35 , but has mixed relaxor and ferroelectric properties and , due to the cation stoichiometry , should contain about 2  mol% o vacancies to ensure charge neutrality .",
    "this composition presents almost no memory imprinting , on the time scale of the previous experiments ( 1 day ) , again demonstrating that the interaction between mobile defects and polar clusters or ferroelectric microdomains can not give rise to memory phenomena as found in relaxors and spin glasses . on the other hand , memory in the defective system",
    "is imprinted on a much longer time scale ( months ) , suggesting that in this case the migration and reorientation of defects in the field of well developed ferroelectric domains occurred .",
    "these findings show that the memory phenomena typical of certain canonical spin glasses and found in some relaxor ferroelectrics are intrinsic of the relaxor state also above the freezing temperature for the polar fluctuations .",
    "a comparison is made with y@xmath11ca@xmath12mno@xmath0 , where the spin glass state is preceded by short - range ferromagnetic order , mnn01 and with superparamagnetic systems , where it is possible to tune both the width of the relaxation times of the relaxing units and their degree of interaction .",
