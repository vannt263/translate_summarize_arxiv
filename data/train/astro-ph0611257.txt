    "as the nearest large spiral galaxy to our own , m31 is a prime target for stellar populations studies aimed at understanding the formation and evolution of such galaxies .",
    "an important subset of this work concerns the globular cluster system of m31 , since the objects belonging to this system allow us to trace the star formation history , chemical evolution , and mass distribution of m31 .",
    "recently , as part of a major survey of the m31 halo with the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , a search for previously unknown globular clusters , at large projected radii from the center of m31 , has been conducted .",
    "details of the int survey may be found in @xcite ( see also the references therein ) ; spatial coverage now extends to more than @xmath7 deg@xmath8 .",
    "the globular cluster search has resulted in the discovery of a significant number of new clusters , with projected radii ( @xmath9 ) extending to @xmath10 kpc ( see e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "hubble space telescope ( hst ) imaging of many of these new clusters has recently been carried out  first results from this work are described elsewhere ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "one surprising result to arise from the globular cluster survey was the discovery of a previously unknown population of extended , luminous objects in the outskirts of m31 @xcite .",
    "specifically , three such clusters were discovered , with @xmath11 kpc .",
    "these clusters are notable because they have large half - light radii ( @xmath12 ) , but unlike known globular clusters with similar structures , also have luminosities near the peak of the globular cluster luminosity function ( gclf ) . as such , they are dissimilar to any other known clusters in the milky way , m31 , or anywhere else , and begin to fill in the gap in parameter space between classical globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies @xcite .",
    "subsequent to the discovery of these three clusters , a further survey of the southern quadrant of the outer m31 halo , and down the minor axis of m31 to m33 , has been conducted with megacam on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "an additional extended cluster was located with these observations , at a projected radius of @xmath0 kpc . following the nomenclature of @xcite",
    ", we label this object ec4 .",
    "its coordinates are listed in table [ t : results ] .",
    "this is one of the most remote m31 globular clusters currently known , after two of the newly - discovered classical globular clusters at @xmath13 and @xmath14 kpc ( see paper ii ) , and the new cluster of @xcite , at @xmath15 kpc .    in this letter , we report on the first results from imaging of the four unique luminous , extended m31 clusters with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) on - board hst .",
    "our observations were obtained with the acs wide field channel ( wfc ) under hst program go 10394 ( p.i .",
    "tanvir ) , between 2005 july 10  2005 july 23 .",
    "each cluster was imaged three times in the f606w filter and four times in the f814w filter , with small dithers between subsequent images .",
    "typical total integration times were 1800s in f606w and 3000s in f814w .",
    "each cluster was placed at the centre of either chip 1 or chip 2 on the wfc , to ensure that the inter - chip gap did not impact the observations . in fig .",
    "[ f : images ] we display drizzled f606w images of the four clusters , confirming the nature of these objects .",
    "each is clearly very extended and of low surface brightness , quite different in structure to the classical globular clusters which have previously been observed in m31 ( see e.g. , the images in * ? ? ?",
    "we used the dolphot photometry software @xcite , specifically the acs module , to photometer our images .",
    "dolphot performs point - spread function ( psf ) fitting using psfs especially tailored to the acs camera . for a given cluster ,",
    "photometry was done simultaneously on all the flat - fielded images from the stsci archive ( both filters ) , relative to some deep reference image ",
    "we used the drizzled combination of our f814w images .",
    "dolphot accounts for the hot - pixel and cosmic - ray masking information provided with each flat - fielded image , fits the sky locally around each detected source , and provides magnitudes corrected for charge - transfer efficiency ( cte ) effects on the calibrated vegamag scale of @xcite .",
    "a variety of quality information is listed with each detected object , including the object type ( stellar , extended , etc ) , @xmath16 of the psf fit , sharpness and roundness of the object , and a `` crowding '' parameter which describes how much brighter an object would have been had neighbouring objects not been fit simultaneously .",
    "we used some of this information to select only stars with high quality measurements .",
    "specifically , we selected objects of stellar type , with valid photometry on all seven input images , global sharpness parameter between @xmath17 and @xmath18 in each filter , and crowding parameter less than @xmath19 in each filter .",
    "we isolated each cluster from the surrounding field population by imposing a radial cut .",
    "two ( ec1 , ec3 ) are located , in projection , fairly close to the main body of m31 , and hence have heavy background fields . for these objects , we set the selection radii to be small ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively ) .",
    "we found these sufficient to obtain clean cluster colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) with plenty of stars still available to define the primary sequences .",
    "for the two clusters at large projected radii ( ec2 , ec4 ) , we used limiting radii closer to the expected cluster tidal radii , at @xmath22 .",
    "[ f : cmds ] shows cmds for the four clusters .",
    "our photometry reaches @xmath1 mag below the level of the horizontal branch ( hb ) , to a limiting magnitude of @xmath23 .",
    "each cluster exhibits a narrow , steep red - giant branch ( rgb ) , and clearly delineated horizontal branch .",
    "three of the clusters possess hbs extending to the blue , including broadened regions with colours in the range @xmath24 which are suggestive of rr lyrae stars imaged at random points during their cycle . taken together , these features are indicative of old ( @xmath2 gyr ) , metal - poor stellar populations .",
    "we observe no sign of young or intermediate - age populations in these clusters , such as a blue plume or luminous agb stars above the rgb tip .",
    "comparing cmds for the inner and outer parts of each cluster does not reveal any radially dependent differences such as those commonly seen in dsph galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . furthermore , the widths of the four rgbs above the hb level are comparable to each other and to those for our classical globular clusters ( see paper ii ) , and are consistent with the photometric errors . hence , we see no evidence for multiple stellar populations within our four clusters .",
    "this argues against merger formation scenarios except those in which the parent clusters were of similar age and metallicity , as well as scenarios involving stripped dsphs .    in order to obtain photometric metallicity estimates from our cmds",
    ", we used the cluster fiducial sequences in the acs / wfc f606w and f814w bands presented by @xcite . because our four targets are distributed across a large area of sky and a wide variety of projected radii from m31 , it is prudent not to assume a single distance modulus or reddening value for all .",
    "rather , we adopted a procedure to simultaneously constrain the metallicity , distance modulus , and reddening for each cluster .",
    "we chose to register the fiducials to our cluster cmds using the f606w magnitude of the hb and the colour of the red - giant branch ( rgb ) at the hb level .",
    "if the metallicity of the reference fiducial matches that for a given cluster , then when registered using these two points , the fiducial will closely trace the upper rgb of the cluster .",
    "if the reference fiducial is of incorrect metallicity , the fiducial and cmd will deviate on the upper rgb . bounding the cluster rgb with more metal - rich and metal - poor fiducials",
    "allows the true cluster metallicity to be estimated .",
    "the absorption in each acs bandpass is a non - linear function of both effective temperature and @xmath25 .",
    "@xcite therefore provide two coefficients ( @xmath26 ) per bandpass at each point on their fiducial sequences , allowing the absorption to be calculated given @xmath25 .",
    "for example , in f606w the absorption @xmath27 is : @xmath28 ^ 2 , \\label{eq1}\\ ] ] and similarly in f814w .",
    "following @xcite , m31 has distance modulus @xmath29 ; however , due to the line - of - sight depth of the system , the cluster distance moduli must be scattered about this value .",
    "we decided to test over a range of @xmath30 mag , representing a system depth of @xmath31 kpc .",
    "for a given @xmath32 , we used eq .",
    "[ eq1 ] to solve for the @xmath25 which aligned the hb levels of the observed cluster and the fiducial under consideration . with this constrained , we calculated the difference between the colour of the cluster rgb at hb level , and that of the transformed fiducial ; the best solution for @xmath32 and @xmath25 was the combination which minimised this offset .",
    "we derived uncertainties in these quantities by randomly selecting new hb levels for the fiducial and cluster and a new rgb colour for the cluster , from gaussian distributions about our measured values ( typical distribution widths were @xmath33 mag in the hb levels , and @xmath34 mag in the rgb colour ) , and solving for new @xmath32 and @xmath25 . iterating ten thousand times built up distributions from which we derived standard random errors .",
    "these are generally @xmath35 mag in @xmath32 and @xmath36 mag in @xmath25 .",
    "we note that there are possibly additional systematic errors present for our measured @xmath25 values , due to differences in age between the m31 clusters and the fiducial clusters , and the fact that the colour of the rgb at the hb level is mildly age - sensitive . at most ,",
    "these errors would amount to @xmath37 mag more than quoted in table [ t : results ] , corresponding to the interval @xmath38 gyr .    with the fiducials aligned , it was straightforward to infer the most likely value of @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] ( and hence the best values for @xmath32 and @xmath25 ) for a given cluster .",
    "the fiducial alignments are presented in fig .",
    "[ f : fids ] , and the numerical results in table [ t : results ] . typical errors in @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] are approximately @xmath40 dex . from fig .",
    "[ f : fids ] , it is clear that all four clusters are metal - poor objects .",
    "three have an rgb locus intermediate between those for ngc 6341 ( m92 ) and ngc 6752 , while the fourth ( ec3 ) matches closely that for ngc 6341 .",
    "@xcite adopt @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 = -2.14 $ ] and @xmath41 for these two clusters , respectively ; the listed metallicities in table [ t : results ] reflect these values .    for comparison ,",
    "we consider values of @xmath25 from the extinction maps of @xcite ( see table [ t : results ] ) .",
    "the agreement is close , indicating the validity of our method .",
    "we note a tendency to over - estimate @xmath25 by @xmath42 mag ; @xcite found a similar effect in their large study of m31 globular clusters .",
    "adopting @xmath25 from @xcite tends to increase @xmath32 by a few hundredths of a magnitude and does not noticeably affect the derived @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] ; however the alignment for ec4 is noticeably inferior .",
    "our derived distance moduli for the two clusters with smallest @xmath9 are @xmath43 , matching the m31 value from @xcite .",
    "ec4 may lie somewhat closer to us than the bulk of m31 ; however this is unsurprising given its large @xmath9 .    from our cmds and estimated @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ]",
    ", it is clear that there is a strong second parameter effect among this set of clusters .",
    "deriving accurate hb - morphology parameters requires variability information , completeness tests , and a treatment of photometric blends at the red end of the hb ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and is therefore beyond the scope of the present letter .",
    "we defer such calculations to a future paper , currently in preparation .",
    "even so , examining the three clusters with very similar @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 \\sim -1.84 $ ] , the second parameter effect is easily discernible by eye .",
    "ec2 has an exclusively red hb , while ec4 has an intermediate hb and ec1 has a mostly blue hb .",
    "the cmd for ec2 is strikingly similar to that for the smc globular ngc 121 , which has comparable @xmath39fe@xmath4h@xmath5 $ ] .",
    "this cluster is @xmath44 gyr younger than the oldest galactic and lmc globular clusters ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting that a similar age spread may be present among our m31 clusters .",
    "finally , we obtained estimates of structural parameters and total luminosities by means of integrated ( aperture ) photometry .",
    "this technique ensures unresolved cluster light is counted , and obviates any present need for lengthy completeness tests .",
    "using the cmds we estimated the largest apertures ( @xmath45 ) within which field star contamination does not add significantly to the integrated cluster luminosity .",
    "for a given cluster we used this aperture to obtain the total luminosity in f606w and f814w ( background galaxies and bright field stars were masked ) , then used these to transform the f606w value into johnson @xmath46 using the prescription in @xcite .",
    "we then calculated @xmath47 using our measured @xmath25 and @xmath32 .",
    "these luminosities are lower limits , since @xmath45 is almost certainly smaller than the tidal radius in all clusters . for ec2 and",
    "ec4 the amount of missing light is only @xmath48 mag , since @xmath49 pc .",
    "however , for ec1 and ec3 , which have small @xmath45 , the shortfall is significant .",
    "based on profiles for ec2 and ec4 , the true luminosity of ec1 may be @xmath50 mag brighter than listed , and that for ec3 @xmath51 mag brighter .",
    "with @xmath47 calculated , we sampled the luminosity profile of each cluster with a variety of apertures to determine the half - light radius @xmath12 .",
    "subtracting the luminosities within consecutive apertures allowed preliminary surface brightness profiles to be constructed . from each , the core radius @xmath52 ( at which the surface brightness is half its central value ) was estimated .",
    "table [ t : results ] lists @xmath52 and @xmath12 , converted to parsecs using our measured @xmath32 .",
    "typical uncertainties are @xmath53 in each .    taken together",
    ", the above results confirm the original conclusion of @xcite that these four objects strongly resemble classical globular clusters in terms of their old , metal - poor stellar populations , but are quite different structurally .",
    "specifically , their luminosities sit around the peak of the gclf , and as such they are much brighter than similarly extended objects found in the milky way ( including the new cluster of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the lmc , or externally ( such as the ",
    "faint fuzzies  of * ? ? ?",
    "they thus encroach on the gap in parameter space between classical globular clusters ( which are dark matter free ) and dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( which are dark matter dominated ) .",
    "further study of this unique population will shed light on the transition region between globular clusters and dwarf spheroidals , and provide important clues to the formation and evolution of these clusters , which may be strongly linked to that of m31 .",
