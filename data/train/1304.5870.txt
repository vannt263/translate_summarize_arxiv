    "the anchored @xmath0-core problem can be explained by the following illustrative example .",
    "we want to organize a workshop on theory of social networks .",
    "we send invitations to most distinguished researchers in the area and received many replies of the following nature : ",
    "yes , in theory , i would be happy to come but my final decision depends on how many people i know will be there .",
    "\" thus we have a list of tentative participants , but some of them can cancel their participation and we are afraid that the cancellation process may escalate . on the other hand , we also have limited funds to reimburse travel expenses for a small number of participants , which we believe , will guarantee their participation .",
    "thus we want to  anchor \" a small subset of participants whose guaranteed participation would prevent the unraveling process , and by fixing a small group we hope to minimize the number of cancellations , or equivalently , maximize the number of participants , or the core .",
    "unraveling processes are common for social networks where the behavior of an individual is often influenced by the actions of her / his friends .",
    "new events occur quite often in social networks : some examples are usage of a particular cell phone brand , adoption of a new drug within the medical profession , or the rise of a political movement in an unstable society . to estimate whether these events or ideas spread extensively or die out soon , one has to model and study the dynamics of _ influence propagation _ in social networks .",
    "social networks are generally represented by making use of undirected or directed graphs , where the edge set represents the relationship between individuals in the network .",
    "undirected graph model works fine for some networks , say facebook , but the nature of interaction on some social networks such as twitter is asymmetrical : the fact that user @xmath15 follows user @xmath16 does not imply that that user @xmath16 also follows @xmath15 . in this case",
    ", it is more appropriate to model interactions in the network by * directed * graphs .",
    "we add a directed edge @xmath17 if @xmath18 follows @xmath19 .    in this work",
    "we are interested in the model of _ user engagement _ , where each individual with less than @xmath0 people to follow ( or equivalently whose in - degree is less than @xmath0 ) drops out of the network .",
    "this process can be contagious , and may affect even those individuals who initially were linked to more than @xmath0 people , say follow on twitter .",
    "an extreme example of this was given by schelling ( see page 17 of  @xcite ) : consider a directed path on @xmath20 vertices and let @xmath10 .",
    "the left - endpoint has in - degree zero , it drops out and now the in - degree of its only out - neighbor in the path becomes zero and it drops out as well .",
    "it is not hard to see that this way the whole network eventually drops out as the result of a _ cascade of iterated withdrawals_. in general at the end of all the iterated withdrawals the remaining engaged individuals form a unique maximal induced subgraph whose minimum in - degree is at least @xmath0 .",
    "this is called as the _ @xmath0-core _ and is a well - known concept in the theory of social networks .",
    "it was introduced by seidman  @xcite and also been studied in various social sciences literature  @xcite .",
    "* preventing unraveling : * the unraveling process described above in schelling s example of a directed path can be highly undesirable in many scenarios .",
    "how can one attempt to prevent this unraveling ?",
    "in schelling s example it is easy to see : if we  buy \" the left end - point person into being engaged then the whole path becomes engaged .",
    "in general we overcome the issue of unraveling by allowing some  anchors \" : these are the vertices that remain engaged irrespective of their payoffs .",
    "this can be achieved by giving them extra incentives or discounts .",
    "the hope is that with a few _ anchors _ we can now ensure a large subgraph remains engaged .",
    "this subgraph is called as the",
    "_ anchored @xmath0-core _ : each non - anchor vertex in this induced subgraph must have in - degree at least @xmath0 while the anchored vertices can have arbitrary in - degrees .",
    "the problem of identifying @xmath0-cores in a network also has the following game - theoretical interpretation introduced by bhawalkar et al .",
    "@xcite : each user in the social network pays a cost of @xmath0 to remain engaged . on the other hand , he / she receives a profit of one from every neighbor who is engaged .",
    "network effects \" come into play , and an individual decides to remain engaged if has non - negative payoff , i.e. , it has at least @xmath0 in - neighbors who are engaged .",
    "the @xmath0-core can be viewed as the unique maximal equilibrium in this model .",
    "bhawalkar et al .",
    "@xcite introduced the anchored @xmath0-core problem for ( undirected ) graphs . in the anchored @xmath0-core problem",
    "the input is an undirected graph @xmath21 and integers @xmath2 , and the task is to find an induced subgraph @xmath4 of maximum size with all vertices but at most @xmath5 ( which are anchored ) to be of degree at least @xmath0 . in this work",
    "we extend the notion of anchored @xmath0-core to directed graphs .",
    "we are interested in the case , when in - degrees of all but @xmath5 vertices of @xmath4 are at least @xmath0 .",
    "more formally , we study the following parameterized version of the problem",
    ".    we will call the set @xmath15 as the _ anchors _ , the graph @xmath4 as the _ anchored @xmath0-core_. note that the undirected version of anchored @xmath0-core problem can be modeled by the directed version : simply replace each edge @xmath22 by arcs @xmath17 and @xmath23 . keeping the parameters",
    "@xmath24 unchanged it is now easy to see that the two instances are equivalent .",
    "* parameterized complexity : * we are mainly interested in the parameterized complexity of anchored @xmath0-core . for the general background ,",
    "we refer to the books by downey and fellows  @xcite , flum and grohe  @xcite and niedermeier  @xcite .",
    "parameterized complexity is basically a two dimensional framework for studying the computational complexity of a problem .",
