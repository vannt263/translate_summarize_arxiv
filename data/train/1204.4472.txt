    "in comparison with stationary black holes , understanding of dynamical black holes is still far from clear .",
    "although there is a lot of potentially interesting subjects such as thermodynamical properties , dynamical stability , or hawking radiation , the absence of the preferred time direction makes them intractable . also , lack of concrete exact solutions in simple systems is one of the main reasons for the relatively slow progress .    in the present paper , among others ,",
    "we focus on asymptotically anti - de  sitter ( ads ) dynamical black holes . in the history of gravitation physics , ads",
    "black holes had been considered unrealistic and eccentric configurations for a long time .",
    "however , they stepped into the limelight by the discovery of the ads / cft duality  @xcite .",
    "now ads black holes have new significance as a stage to study strongly coupled gauge theories and occupy a central position of research in string theory .",
    "the motivation of the study in the present paper is twofold .",
    "one comes from the ads / cft duality .",
    "while a static ads black hole corresponds to the field theory at the boundary which has finite temperature in equilibrium , a dynamical ads black hole would correspond to some field theory in the non - equilibrium state .",
    "actually , an asymptotically ads spacetime has been studied in a dynamical setting as a holographic dual to the bjorken flow  @xcite . while the dynamical spacetime in  @xcite was constructed perturbatively , exact dynamical ads black holes are desirable to derive more specific results .",
    "the second motivation comes from the recently - found dynamical instability of the ads spacetime .",
    "although the ads vacuum is known to be stable at the linear level , its nonlinear instability was numerically found with a massless klein - gordon field in arbitrary dimensions  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite . )",
    "it was both numerically and analytically supported that an ads black hole forms as a result of this instability  @xcite .",
    "however , there is an argument that static ads black holes are also unstable at the nonlinear level  @xcite .",
    "( see also  @xcite . ) therefore , the final fate of the instability of the ads vacuum or a static ads black hole is still not clear at present . in this context , not only a static configuration but also a dynamical configuration is the candidate of the final state .",
    "an example is an oscillating or time - periodic spacetime  @xcite .",
    "therefore , an exact dynamical black - hole solution might represent the final state or an intermediate stage during the time evolution and must be useful for further study .",
    "in the present paper , we consider spacetimes with spherical , plane , or hyperbolic symmetry in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "it is well - known in this system that the no - hair theorem holds for a wide class of scalar fields , which prohibits asymptotically flat black holes with non - trivial configuration of scalar fields  @xcite .",
    "here one assumes staticity to prove the no - hair theorem . for a massless klein - gordon field ,",
    "even a stronger result is available , namely the no - hair theorem independent of the asymptotic condition for the spacetime and the value of @xmath0 .",
    "( see appendix  a for the proof . ) as a result , all the known solutions with a non - trivial scalar field in this system contain naked singularities both for @xmath1  @xcite and @xmath2  @xcite , and the only possible static black hole is the schwarzschild(-(a)ds ) black hole with a constant scalar field or its topological generalization .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain non - trivial black - hole solutions , one has to remove the assumption of staticity . in four dimensions ,",
    "a set of exact dynamical and inhomogeneous solutions has been obtained by many authors  @xcite . in the present paper",
    ", we generalize this set of solutions and show that some of the solutions describe a locally ads dynamical black hole . in the case where the klein - gordon field is purely imaginary , namely ghost , an ads dynamical wormhole may be realized .    in the following section , we give our spacetime ansatz and present the solutions . in sec .",
    "iii , we show that the class - i solution represents an ads dynamical black hole or wormhole . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the properties of other classes of solutions . concluding remarks are summarized in sec .  v. the scalar no - hair theorem for a massless klein - gordon field",
