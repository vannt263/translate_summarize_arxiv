    ".    surfaces containing @xmath8 circles through each point are particular cases of surfaces containing @xmath8 conic sections through each point . the latter have been classified by schicho @xcite .",
    "using schicho s results , in @xcite the classification of the former has been reduced to solving the equation @xmath18 in polynomials @xmath19 $ ] of degree at most @xmath8 in each of the variables @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "such `` pythagorean @xmath22-tuple '' of polynomials defines a ( possibly degenerate ) surface @xmath23 in @xmath24 containing two ( possibly degenerate ) circles @xmath25 and @xmath26 through each point .",

    "pythagorean @xmath0- and @xmath10-tuples of real polynomials were described in ( * ? ? ? * theorem  2.2 ) using that @xmath29 $ ] is a unique factorization domain ( ufd ) .",
    "a similar result holds for @xmath22-tuples of polynomials in one variable ( see corollary  [ conj-1-var ] below , cf .",

    "this can not be repaired by a divisor theory because of no nice multiplication of ideals in noncommutative setup .",
    "another method to describe the solution set is to give _ transformations _ producing all solutions from a few initial ones recursively . for integral pythagorean @xmath32-tuples , @xmath33 , this was done in @xcite . but this does not give a parametrization of the solution set and is not easily generalized to polynomials .    finally , a parametrization of pythagorean @xmath32-tuples _ up to common factor _ is immediately given by the inverse stereographic projection .",
    "but this does not allow to extract the required degree 4 solutions .",
    "so the case of @xmath22-tuples of polynomials of degree @xmath8 in @xmath20 and @xmath21 arising in our geometric problem seems to be the simplest case not accessible by known methods .",

    "we start with a naive approach ( working only for a ufd ) , then extract the major obstacle , and finally introduce a tool to overcome it .",
