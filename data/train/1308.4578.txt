    "the recent measurement of a non - vanishing @xmath3 by daya bay @xcite and reno @xcite has exerted some pressure on models for neutrino mixing based on the permutation groups ( like @xmath4 and @xmath0 , @xcite ) , as they are generically constructed to give at leading order very specific patterns in which @xmath5 and the other angles are also completely fixed .",
    "corrections from the charged sector or next - to - leading contributions to the neutrino mass matrix have to be invoked to correct such patterns and make the models compatible with the experimental data .",
    "the usual approach to model building is that of considering a lagrangian invariant under a flavour group @xmath6 and to subsequently break @xmath6 into two different subgroups in the charged lepton and neutrino sector , is such a way to create two different rotations , responsible for a non - diagonal pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( @xmath7 ) mixing matrix .",
    "the structure of @xmath6 can also be reconstructed from the residual symmetries of the mass matrices after symmetry breaking ; for example , using the criterion that a flavour group should be obtained from the neutrino mixing matrix without parameter tuning , it was shown in @xcite that the minimal group containing all the symmetries of the neutrino mass matrix and leading to the tri - bimaximal mixing ( tbm @xcite ) is @xmath0 .",
    "the fact that the mixing angles are fixed to well defined values is the consequence of forcing all the symmetries of the mass matrix to belong to @xmath6 . moving from this consideration , in @xcite a different point of view",
    "was adopted : they assumed that the residual symmetries in both the charged lepton and neutrino sectors are one - generator groups . indicating with @xmath8 and @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) the generators of the @xmath11 and @xmath12 discrete symmetries of the neutrino and charged leptons mass matrices",
    ", the previous condition implies that @xmath13 form a set of generators for the flavor group @xmath6 for given @xmath14 and @xmath15 , with the meaning that all other symmetries appear accidentally .",
    "the structure of the generators is restricted by the additional requirements to be elements of @xmath16 , for which @xmath17 = det[t_\\alpha ] = 1 $ ] , so they can be written as : s_1 & = & diag(1,-1,-1 ) , s_2 = diag(-1,1,-1 ) , s_3 = diag(-1,-1,1 ) + t_e & = & diag(1 , e^2i k / m , e^-2i k / m ) , t_= diag(e^2i k / m , 1 , e^-2i k / m ) , + t_&= & diag ( e^2i k / m , e^-2i k / m , 1 ) . the definition of @xmath6 requires a relation linking @xmath8 and @xmath9 , assumed to be + @xmath18 the lack of additional symmetry in @xmath6 has the direct consequence that the mixing angles are not all fixed ( like in the tbm ) but rather present some interesting correlations , or sum rules , that open the possibility to reconcile the predictions of the permutation groups with the experimental data already at leading order ( see also @xcite for similar sum rules obtained in the context of @xmath0 and @xcite for sum - rules from residual @xmath11 simmetries ) . the question we want to analyze in this paper is whether such correlations can be tested at neutrino facilities or , in other words , if model comparison and selection can be achieved at currently taking data or planned superbeams .",
    "it is clear that if two models live in completely different regions of the parameter space ( given by the spanned values of all @xmath19 and the leptonic cp phase ) the measurement of the mixing parameters with huge precision will give the answer ; however , we are still away from such an idealized situation , at least for what concerns the cp phase , and it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the neutrino facilities to face this problem . in this respect ,",
    "we have selected two models from @xcite , called @xmath20 and @xmath21 , which have been shown to be compatible with the current experimental data in the neutrino sector and with the hypothesis of tbm , and have used their different correlations to compute and compare ( in a @xmath22 analysis ) the expected event rates at t2k , no@xmath2a and t2hk , with the aim of identifying the regions in the @xmath23-plane where the models can be distinguished at some confidence level .",
    "an interesting work along similar lines has been recently presented in @xcite , where the main focus was on the ability of next - generation of neutrino oscillation experiments to constraints correlations involving @xmath24 , @xmath3 and @xmath25 .",
    "we differ from @xcite in that we consider different neutrino facilities , we use non - linear relations between the oscillation parameters and adopt a different statistical analysis with the purpose , given the lack of information on the cp phase , to present exclusion regions directly in the @xmath23 parameter space .",
    "it is important to stress again that such correlations are _ leading order _",
    "predictions , in the sense that they are derived from group theoretical considerations and do not take into account possible higher order effects into the lepton mass matrices of new - physics effects @xcite , otherwise model - dependent features will appear with the main effect to spoil the sum rules and introduce additional indetermination of the parameter spaces where the models live .",
    "we do not take into account this possibility , as we are mainly interested to check whether the easiest case ( validity of the sum rules ) can be addressed at neutrino experiments .",
    "we revise the useful neutrino transition probabilities in sect.[sec2 ] , where we also introduce the models @xmath20 and @xmath21 and discuss the parameter spaces allowed by the correlations ; in sect.[sec3 ] we introduce the neutrino facilities used in our numerical simulation and discuss the results of the statistical analysis performed to distinguish the models .",
    "our conclusions are drawn in sect.[conc ] .",
    "since we are interested in the performance of superbeam facilities , it is enough to consider the @xmath26 appearance and @xmath27 disappearance probabilities ( and their cp - conjugate ) . given the relatively large @xmath3 , we consider the probabilities up to first order in the small parameter @xmath28 @xcite while keeping their exact dependence on @xmath3 . in vacuum",
    "they read : p_e&= & ^2 2_13 s^2_23 ^2 - r , + & & + p_&=&1-^2 + r + & & \\ { 2(c_13 ^ 2 ( ^2(2_23 ) ( c_12 ^ 2-s_12 ^ 2 s_13 ^ 2)-4 s_13 2_12 )",

    "notice that : [ eq : panti ] p_|| & = & p_(_cp - _ cp ) + p _ & = & p_(_cp - _ cp ) , , = e , , .",
    "as it is well known , @xmath32 is mainly dependent of @xmath3 and @xmath33 whereas @xmath34 is recognized to be more sensitive to the atmospheric parameters ; although the dependence on @xmath33 is suppressed by the small @xmath35 , the approximation adopted shows that @xmath3 already appears at leading order .",
    "we then expect that flavour models with different parameter spaces , that is with the mixing parameters living in different regions , are also characterized by different transition probabilities that , extracted from the experimental data , can help in distinguishing among them . in our numerical computations",
    "we consider the mixing angles to vary within the 2@xmath36 intervals taken from @xcite : ^2 _ 23&= & 0.386^+0.062_-0.038 + ^2 _ 13&= & 0.0241^+0.0049_-0.0048 [ bounds ] + ^2 _ 12&= & 0.307^+0.035_-0.032 , whereas the cp phase is left free to vary in the whole @xmath37 range .",
    "we consider the mass differences as constant quantities , @xmath38 ev@xmath39 , @xmath40 ev@xmath39 , since the models studied in this paper do not give any information on the neutrino masses .      in this section",
    "we recall the main features of the correlations arising from two different models discussed in @xcite , of which we also follow the nomenclature .",
    "both of them have @xmath41 .",
    "the first model , called @xmath20 , uses the generator @xmath42 and the pair of values @xmath43 , which corresponds to the group @xmath0 .",
    "the obtained relations among the mixing angles are : ^2_12 = .",
    "[ s4a ] and 2_23 = - , [ th23zzz ] also obtained in the explicit model of ref.@xcite and further studied in @xcite .",
    "for any values of @xmath3 , the first relation always gives an acceptable value of the solar angle , within the 2@xmath36 bounds quoted in eq.([bounds ] ) , so this relation does not set any restriction on the reactor angle .",
    "it has to be noted , however , that the dependence on the cosinus function forces @xmath44 to be around @xmath45 , very close to the current central value . on the other hand , eq.([th23zzz ] ) imposes a constraint on the possible pairs of @xmath23 needed to fulfill the bounds for @xmath24 in eq.([bounds ] ) ; in particular , the value of the cp phase can never be maximal in this model and , in order to have an atmospheric angle in the first octant , the relation @xmath46 must hold .",
    "the exact bounds in the @xmath23-plane can be derived numerically from eq.([th23zzz ] ) and are shown in fig.([figt1limits ] ) where , as expected , no restriction on the reactor angle is present and the cp phase is limited in a horizontal band above maximal violation .    the other model considered in our analysis is called @xmath21 , which uses the generator @xmath47 and the pair of values @xmath48 , which corresponds to the group @xmath1 . in this model the mixing angles and the cp phase are related by the following relations : ^2_12 = [ a4 ] and 2_23 = .",
    "[ eqqq ] the previous relations set important constraints on the reactor angle and the cp phase .",
    "in fact , given the bounds on @xmath49 , the reactor angle is restricted to be @xmath50 , that is in a region where @xmath51 , still compatible with the range in eq.([bounds ] ) .",
    "in addition , the allowed range for the atmospheric angle restricts @xmath33 to be below the maximal value .",
    "the situation is illustrated again in fig.([figt1limits ] ) , where we clearly see that the resulting parameter space in the @xmath23-plane for this model is quite different from that of the @xmath20 model .    _ allowed values of @xmath33 as a function of @xmath52 as derived imposing the correlations among the mixing parameters , eqs.([s4a])-([th23zzz ] ) for the model @xmath20 and eqs.([a4])-([eqqq ] ) for @xmath21 .",
    "_ ]    the allowed regions of the atmospheric and solar angles are instead summarized in fig.([figint ] ) .",
    "_ allowed ranges for @xmath53 and @xmath54 for models @xmath20 ( light gray ) and @xmath21 ( dark gray ) . _ ]    as partially explained above , two very distinct intervals for the solar angles are implied by the two models , so a strong improvement in the measurement of the solar angle could be enough to distinguish among @xmath20 and @xmath21 . on the other hand , there is a large overlap in the allowed @xmath54 , due to the still relatively large uncertainty affecting the determination of this angle . in principle",
    ", a very precise measurement of @xmath55 with central value well below @xmath56 can tell the two models but this possibility seems at the moment quite disfavored .",
    "equipped with the correlations of eqs.([s4a]-[th23zzz ] ) and ( [ a4]-[eqqq ] ) , we can now eliminate the dependence on @xmath49 and @xmath24 in the transition probabilities and get the expressions for the various @xmath57 as predicted by the models , @xmath58 .",
    "the resulting formulae are quite cumbersome , so we prefer not to show complicated analytical results that can hide the physical content of the probabilities .",
    "it is useful , instead , to study the differences : p _",
    "= |p^1t_- p^2t_|,which give information on where to expect the largest differences among the two models .",
    "to make life easier , we assume the same @xmath49 for the two models , which is a good approximation because the intervals of @xmath59 and @xmath60 are contained in the 2@xmath36 uncertainties quoted in eq.([bounds ] ) , and to work in the intervals for @xmath61 where the models overlap ; we take , however , different cp phases , called @xmath62 if referred to the model @xmath20 and @xmath63 if referred to @xmath21 .",
    "we get : p_e & ~ & r _ 13 ( ) + & & [ analitico ] + p _ & ~ & r _ 13 2 ( _ 2-_1 ) . a common feature of the @xmath64 s is the leading dependence on @xmath3 ; given that @xmath65 varies of about 17% in the range quoted in ( [ bounds ] ) , we expect only a minor effects of @xmath3 in distinguishing the models , more pronounced for values close to the rightmost bounds of the regions in fig.([figt1limits ] ) .",
    "the dependence on the phases is , conversely , very significant . in the case of the @xmath26 appearance channel",
    ", @xmath66 is sensibly different from zero for @xmath67 ; this is not exactly the quantity separating the models under investigation since , as seen in fig.([figt1limits ] ) , @xmath68 $ ] ; however , this range of values guarantees that @xmath69 and then that the two models can be , at least in principle , distinguished . for the @xmath70 disappearance channel we observe that , for @xmath71",
    "( whose approximate validity can be appreciated again from fig.([figt1limits ] ) ) , we obtain @xmath72 , because @xmath73 ; thus the phase dependence of @xmath74 results in the addition of two positive contributions and can be relevant in distinguishing the models .    as a final remark , we want to stress that our considerations remain valid for neutrino facilities where matter effects are small , which is the case of interest in this paper .",
    "having discussed the parameter space of the two models in an experimental - independent way , we now turn to the question on whether long baseline neutrino facilities will be able to tell model @xmath20 from model @xmath21 based on the measurement of @xmath57 s and the cp - conjugate transitions .",
    "our previous considerations on probabilities are drawn from analytical expressions in vacuum . however , in studying the performance of a given experimental setup , one must take into account the experimental efficiencies to detect a given neutrino flavour .",
    "the expected number of events are computed according to : n_&=&n_e _ de_p_(e_)_(e_)(e _ ) _ ( e _ ) + & & [ eq : asirate2 ] +    @xmath75 is the cross section for producing the lepton @xmath76 , @xmath77 the detector efficiency to reveal that lepton , @xmath78 the initial neutrino flux at the source and @xmath79 , @xmath80 are normalization factors containing the detector mass and the number of years of data taking .",
    "these events can also be grouped in neutrino energy bins , thus taking full advantage of different spectral information of @xmath81 or @xmath82 .",
    "since the probabilities we are interested in are @xmath32 and @xmath83 , @xmath84 can be an electron or a muon ( and their antiparticles ) .    in order to assess the capabilities of a given facility to tell @xmath20 from @xmath21 we adopt the following strategy :    * for any pair of the mixing parameters @xmath85 in the regions allowed for the model @xmath21 we compute the expected number of events @xmath86 for a given final flavour @xmath15 and neutrino energy bin @xmath14 ( @xmath49 and @xmath24",
    "are then determined from eqs.([a4])-([eqqq ] ) ) ; * we then compare @xmath86 to @xmath87 , where now the mixing parameters are those of the competing model @xmath20 . in this procedure",

    "for the sake of simplicity ,",
    "@xmath89 and @xmath91 are constant in the whole energy range ; * if the obtained minimum is larger than some reference @xmath22 value , @xmath92 , then in the point @xmath85 the two models can be distinguished at a given confidence level . the ensemble of such points identifies the wanted regions .",
    "obviously , the procedure can also be applied in the reverse order , that is considering @xmath20 as the _ true _ model and finding a minimum of the @xmath22 function in the @xmath21 parameter space .",

    "starting from two different neutrino mixing sum rules we have studied if , and to which extent , no@xmath2a , t2k and t2hk are able to falsify one of them in favor of the other .",
    "this is due to the fact that the two sum rules identify different set of values of the neutrino mixing parameters , namely different regions in the cp phase @xmath33 and @xmath49 and partially overlapping regions for @xmath3 and @xmath24 , all of them compatible with the experimental values at 2@xmath36 .",
    "analytical considerations on the @xmath26 and @xmath27 transition probabilities revealed that distinguishing the two type of correlations is possible for large differences among the true values ( chosen in one parameter space ) and the fitted values ( in the competing parameter space ) of @xmath33 .",
    "our numerical simulations have shown that this is indeed the case ; in particular , no@xmath2a and t2k taken alone have the capabilities to tell the @xmath20 model from the @xmath21 model at 90% of confidence level , reducing the portion in the @xmath23-plane of the @xmath20 model where confusion is possible . in the @xmath21 parameter space we revealed a much worse performance , unless the combination of no@xmath2a + t2k data is taken into account , and only in a very limited region at large @xmath3 and small @xmath33 . on the other hand , the t2hk experimental facility ,",
    "taking full advantage of a larger detector mass and of the use of the @xmath127 flux compared to the t2k setup , has a much better performance in terms of model selection in both parameter spaces , leaving aside only a small portion of values of @xmath33 where confusion is still possible .",
    "these small regions disappear if we consider the setup of the nf10 , thus making this facility useful to perform a selection of sum rules modified by the inclusion of various type of next - to - leading order effects .",
