    "in quantum gravity research , much work focuses on pure gravity , not taking into account dynamical matter degrees of freedom .",
    "however it is a priori unclear that a consistent quantum theory of gravity can straightforwardly be coupled to matter without changing some of its main properties . in other words ,",
    "a consistent quantisation of gravity might require the inclusion of matter degrees of freedom from the start .",
    "it is thus mandatory to study the complete system of gravitational and matter degrees of freedom in a quantum theory .",
    "then dynamical quantum gravity effects might alter some properties of the matter sector .",
    "most importantly , quantum gravity fluctuations will typically generate new operators for the matter fields in the effective action .",
    "this effect occurs even if the matter theory that is coupled to gravity is just a free theory .",
    "it is the main goal of this paper to point out that to preserve asymptotic freedom in a matter theory that is coupled to quantum gravity is highly non - trivial .",
    "we will show that quantum gravity fluctuations will induce non - vanishing matter couplings , and thus not allow the matter theory to remain asymptotically free under its coupling to gravity .",
    "we will exemplify this by considering a simple theory of a free scalar field coupled to gravity , where we point out that the so - called gauian matter fixed point of asymptotically safe quantum gravity does not exist , instead all existing fixed points have non - vanishing matter self - interactions .",
    "extensions of this work to the case of non - abelian gauge fields are discussed in the outlook .",
    "+ we investigate this question in a framework , in which quantum gravitational degrees of freedom are carried by the metric .",
    "irrespective of the uv completion for gravity , such a description in terms of the metric holds within the effective - field theory framework @xcite .",
    "it thus holds at scales , presumably below the planck scale , where the microscopic degrees of freedom of gravity can be integrated out and traded for effective degrees of freedom carried by the metric .",
    "thereby many uv completions for gravity can be analysed within one single framework , and observable consequences , e.g. for the cmb , can be studied .    among the candidates for a quantum theory of gravity",
    "there is even one where the parameterisation of quantum gravitational degrees of freedom in terms of the metric in a continuum quantum field theory holds up to arbitrarily high momentum scales , namely asymptotic safety @xcite .",
    "it allows to construct a predictive , continuum quantum field theory of the metric within the path - integral framework .",
    "the uv finiteness of observable quantities follows from the existence of an interacting fixed point in the running couplings , i.e. a zero in their @xmath0 functions . in the vicinity of the fixed point ,",
    "the theory becomes scale - free , thus allowing for a uv limit without any divergences , in which all dimensionless couplings approach their fixed - point values .",
    "a fully non - perturbative formulation of the functional renormalisation group ( frg ) @xcite , for reviews see @xcite , has allowed to collect a substantial amount of evidence for the existence of the fixed point @xcite , and its compatibility with standard model matter @xcite , even allowing for a possibility to solve the triviality problem in qed and the higgs sector @xcite , for reviews see @xcite . for further indications for the existence of the fixed point ,",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "such a scenario faces the following challenge : if the fixed point exists , the theory can only be predictive , if the fixed point has a finite number of uv - attractive directions ( in the case of the non - interacting , gauian fixed point , these are exactly given by the couplings with positive or vanishing canonical dimension ) . since the fixed point is interacting , the determination of these relevant directions , which denote the negative eigenvalues of the stability matrix @xmath1 in the vicinity of a fixed point , the solution to the linearised flow equation is given by @xmath2 with constants of integration @xmath3 and @xmath4 the @xmath5th eigenvector of the stability matrix .",
    "@xmath6 denotes a reference scale .",
    "( this reflects the fact that the rg flow can not predict a numerical value for a physical scale . thus scales such as the transition scale to the fixed - point regime have to be fixed from observations . )",
    "thus @xmath7 implies that towards the ir , the coupling flows away from its fixed - point value , and its ir value corresponds to a free parameter of the theory , that has to be determined by experiment . ]",
    "is technically challenging .",
    "studies within truncated rg flows without matter degrees of freedom indicate that asymptotically safe quantum gravity has at least 3 relevant couplings , and therefore more than 3 free parameters @xcite .",
    "+ including matter into the theory , there are three distinct scenarios with regard to predictivity : either , matter comes with the relevant couplings it already has in the standard model , i.e. without coupling it to gravity .",
    "a more exciting possibility is , that gravity might actually turn some or all of these couplings into irrelevant , and thus predictable couplings .",
    "indications for a possible realisation of this scenario in qed are discovered in @xcite .",
    "+ here we point out that gravity might actually induce further matter interactions which correspond to relevant couplings .",
    "thus a viable quantum theory of dynamical gravitational and matter degrees of freedom might actually have _ more _ relevant couplings , then the sum of relevant couplings in both matter and gravity theories taken separately .",
    "we will discuss how this scenario might be realised within a truncation of the full matter and gravity effective action .",
    "further , the fact that residual interactions exist at the fixed point will of course be crucial for physical predictions obtained from this scenario .",
    "in particular , the question if matter couplings have residual interactions in the far uv can open a window into the realm of quantum gravity phenomenology .",
    "in fact , predictions for high - energy scattering experiments can be obtained from the effective action , see , e.g. @xcite , and crucially depend on the type of operators that are present in the action . here",
    ", we use this framework to address the question how different quantum gravity proposals could be distinguished by the amount of non - gauianity that they induce in the cmb , assuming an inflationary scenario with a single scalar field satisfying slow - roll conditions .",
    "in the following we will examine the structure of the fixed point , i.e. its number of relevant directions , and its non - vanishing couplings , in the context of a scalar matter theory .",
    "we will show that a non - vanishing value for the newton coupling induces non - vanishing matter self - interactions .",
    "this conclusion holds in particular at the fixed point in the context of the asymptotic - safety scenario , but it is also valid within an effective field - theory framework for quantum gravity . in the context of a scalar theory , asymptotic freedom",
    "is usually not expected to hold in any case ; but in a broader context , our calculation exemplifies a general mechanism , that presumably also applies in the case of asymptotically free yang - mills theories .",
    "+ before we present the details of the calculation , let us explain the basic idea underlying it : the reason why a free matter theory does not remain such when coupled to gravity is simple to understand : consider any free matter theory which is coupled to gravity minimally .",
    "then the integration measure contains a factor @xmath8 .",
    "an expansion of @xmath8 around any background metric produces an arbitrary number of vertices .",
    "thus the matter theory is not a free theory any more , instead it contains interaction vertices with the gravitational field of arbitrarily high power .",
    "it is then straightforward to construct loop diagrams which contain metric loops only , and an arbitrary number of external matter legs .",
    "these loop diagrams generate further effective matter - gravity interactions , and most importantly , matter self - interactions .",
    "+ the situation can be compared to qed , where no photon self - interactions are present at the classical , microscopic level , but fermionic loops induce photon - photon - interactions already in the one - loop effective action .    as an example , consider a simple scalar theory described by the following effective action @xmath9 with a momentum - scale dependent wave - function renormalisation @xmath10 .",
    "the momentum scale @xmath11 indicates an infrared cutoff , such that all fluctuations in the path integral with momenta @xmath12 have been integrated out .",
    "+ here we have made use of the fact that the covariant derivative simplifies when acting on a scalar field .",
    "four - scalar interactions are then generated by the following loop diagrams :    , title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]     + similar diagrams induce higher @xmath13 interactions .",
    "it follows from dimensional analysis that such diagrams will generate momentum - dependent scalar self - interactions : depending on the convention one chooses where to have the scale - dependent newton coupling @xmath14 appear , either the graviton propagator will be @xmath15 , or each vertex will be @xmath15 for the two - vertex diagram , and @xmath16 for the four - vertex diagram .",
    "thus the contribution will always generate a term @xmath17 , so four powers of momenta are necessary to compensate the dimensionality of the newton coupling .",
    "thereby the first term that is induced in the effective action will be quartic in the scalar field and in the momentum .",
    "the associated coupling will later be called @xmath18 .",
    "thus gravity fluctuations do not directly induce a running in the scalar potential , as has been observed in @xcite .",
    "however , as we will point out , there is an indirect effect : the metric - induced momentum - dependent scalar self interactions contribute to the running of the scalar potential , and induce a non - vanishing @xmath19 term .",
    "the crucial point about the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ diags1 ] is , that they yield contributions @xmath20 where m is the number of metric propagators , and are independent of the coupling that they generate . in the example",
    "above , we thus get the following contribution to the @xmath0 function of the dimensionful scalar coupling @xmath18 ( see eq .  ):",
    "@xmath21 where @xmath22 is a function fo the cosmological constant and further terms are @xmath23 , @xmath24 and proportional to further matter couplings .",
    "the main point is , that , even if we set all matter couplings to zero , i.e. we start with a free theory , then metric fluctuations generate interaction terms for the matter , see also fig .",
    "[ shiftedgfp ] .     here",
    "we exemplify a matter @xmath0 function for the coupling @xmath25 : without coupling to gravity ( blue line ) , this @xmath0 function will admit a gauian fixed point , as well as possibly a non - gauian one .",
    "including gravity fluctuations , a term @xmath26 will be added to the @xmath0 function , thus shifting the gauian to an interacting , non - gauian fixed point ( red dashed line ) . a second non - gauian fixed point may or may not exist . ]",
    "most importantly , metric fluctuations can add terms to the matter @xmath0 functions which lead to a vanishing of all fixed points .",
    "if such a finding where to be confirmed in untruncated theory space , the asymptotic - safety scenario would not be compatible with the existence of this particular type of matter . within a truncation , such a definite conclusion can obviously not be drawn .",
    "to evaluate the @xmath0 functions of the running couplings we require a tool that is applicable in the perturbative as well as the non - perturbative regime .",
    "we also aim for an analytic continuum calculation .",
    "we employ the functional renormalisation group , where the wetterich equation @xcite allows to evaluate @xmath0 functions even in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "introducing an infrared ( ir ) mass - like regulator function @xmath27 suppresses ir modes ( with @xmath28 ) in the generating functional .",
    "the scale - dependent effective action @xmath29 then contains the effect of quantum fluctuations above the scale @xmath11 only .",
    "its scale - dependence is given by the following functional differential equation : @xmath30 herein @xmath31 and @xmath32 is matrix - valued in field space and denotes the second functional derivative of the effective action with respect to the fields . adding the mass - like regulator and taking the inverse yields the full propagator .",
    "the supertrace contains a trace over all indices ; in the case of a continuous momentum variable it thus implies an integration over the momentum . on the technical side ,",
    "the main advantage of this equation is its one - loop form , since it can be written as the supertrace over the full propagator , with the regulator insertion @xmath33 in the loop .",
    "nevertheless it is crucial to stress that it also yields higher terms in a perturbative expansion , since it depends on the full , field- and momentum - dependent propagator , and not just on the perturbative propagator , see , e.g. @xcite .    for the gravitational part we work in the background field formalism @xcite , where the full metric is split according to @xmath34 where this split does not imply that we consider only small fluctuations around , e.g. a flat background .",
    "within the frg approach we have access to physics also in the fully non - perturbative regime .",
    "the background - field formalism , being highly useful in non - abelian gauge theories ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , is mandatory in gravity , since the background metric allows for a meaningful notion of `` high - momentum '' and `` low - momentum '' modes as implied by the spectrum of the background covariant laplacian . within yang - mills theories the @xmath0 functions are independent of the choice of background , as long as it serves to distinguish the different operators in the truncation . within gravity ,",
    "an exception exists , as the topology of the background can alter the spectrum of fluctuations in the infrared .",
    "thus only the uv behaviour of the running couplings is independent of the choice of background , whereas topologically distinct backgrounds can lead to a different ir behaviour @xcite .",
    "as we are only interested in the @xmath0 functions as they pertain to the uv , we can choose different backgrounds for the gravitational and the matter @xmath0 functions .    in the context of an interacting theory ,",
    "the wetterich equation is usually applied to a truncated theory space .",
    "we thus do not keep all infinitely many terms that are part of the full effective action , but concentrate on a ( typically ) finite subset . in our case , where we are interested in demonstrating that from a free matter theory coupled to gravity matter self - interactions will be generated , we choose a truncation of the following form : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the usual covariant derivative .",
    "it is important to note that we have included all independent operators of fourth order in derivatives and fields .",
    "all other operators of the same order can be rewritten as a linear combination of the above ones , and possibly additional terms that depend on the curvature .    in order to demonstrate that metric fluctuations also remove the gauian fixed point in the scalar potential , we include the @xmath37 coupling , which is to be distinguished from the cosmological constant @xmath38 by its subscript .",
    "the einstein - hilbert and the gauge - fixing term read : @xmath39f_{\\nu}[\\bar{g},h]\\label{eq : ggf},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath40= \\sqrt{2 } \\bar{\\kappa } \\left(\\bar{d}^{\\nu}h_{\\mu     \\nu}-\\frac{1+\\rho_{\\rm gh}}{4}\\bar{d}_{\\mu}h^{\\nu}{}_{\\nu } \\right).\\ ] ] herein , @xmath41 is related to the bare newton constant @xmath42 and @xmath43 is the cosmological constant .",
    "the gauge - fixing term is supplemented by an appropriate ghost term . as within this truncation ghosts",
    "do not couple to the scalar field .",
    "] , we can neglect the ghost term in the calculation of the scalar @xmath0 functions .",
    "we work in landau dewitt gauge @xmath44 , @xmath45 here . in the following ,",
    "we employ a decomposition of the metric fluctuations into irreducible components under the poincare group . in our choice of gauge , only the transverse traceless mode @xmath46 ( with @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) and the trace mode @xmath49 can contribute to the running in the matter sector .    to evaluate matter @xmath0 functions , it is useful to proceed as follows : splitting @xmath50 , where all scalar - field dependent terms enter the fluctuation matrix @xmath51",
    ", we may now expand the right - hand side of the flow equation as follows : @xmath52^{-1}(\\partial_t r_k)\\}\\label{eq : flowexp}\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{2 } { \\rm str}\\ , \\tilde{\\partial}_t\\ln \\mathcal{p}_k + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty}\\frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n } { \\rm    str}\\ , \\tilde{\\partial}_t(\\mathcal{p}_k^{-1}\\mathcal{f}_k)^n , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the derivative @xmath53 in the second line by definition acts only on the @xmath11 dependence of the regulator , @xmath54 , see appendix [ partialtreg ] .",
    "since each factor of @xmath55 contains a coupling to external fields , this expansion simply corresponds to an expansion in the number of vertices .",
    "thus we can straightforwardly write down the diagrammatic expansion of a @xmath0 function , see fig .",
    "[ alldiags ] . herein , the internal propagator lines contain the mass - like regulator - function , and in the case of the graviton , also depend on the cosmological constant . in order to project onto the anomalous dimension @xmath56",
    ", we can terminate the expansion at second order in the vertices , since all further terms in the expansion must have more than two external scalar fields .",
    "similarly , the evaluation of the @xmath57 for @xmath58 and @xmath59 requires terms up to @xmath60 , see fig .",
    "[ alldiags ] .    here",

    "each loop contains a regulator insertion @xmath33 that can be found on any of the internal lines . ]    clearly a flat background , @xmath66 is fully sufficient to project onto the matter @xmath0 functions , and thus preferable for reasons of technical simplicity .    by using a regulator of the form",
    "@xmath67 it is then straightforward to find which type of contribution to the @xmath0 function a particular diagram corresponds to : each graviton propagator comes with a factor of @xmath14 .",
    "thus , e.g. the two - vertex contribution 2b , see fig .",
    "[ diags1 ] yields a contribution @xmath68 , since the vertex is @xmath69 , and each propagator @xmath70 .",
    "next we introduce the anomalous dimension @xmath71 as well as dimensionless and renormalised couplings @xmath72 it is then straightforward to see that the @xmath64 have the following form @xmath73 where the first term arises from the canonical dimensionality . the constants @xmath74 are regulator and gauge dependent , as are the functions @xmath75 .",
    "these quantities remain to be determined .",
    "crucially , we see that depending on the @xmath74 and the behaviour of @xmath75 , the point @xmath76 may _ not _ be a fixed point of the rg flow , whereas it clearly is in the case @xmath77 .",

    "[ alldiags ] vanish if projected onto vanishing external momenta .",

    "thus the matter contribution to @xmath96 and @xmath97 arises from the kinetic matter term only . since @xmath98",
    ", we do however get a backcoupling of the @xmath99 into the gravitational @xmath0 functions in this indirect way . here",
    "we can use that a maximally symmetric background with positive curvature suffices to evaluate these @xmath0 functions .",
    "for the metric and ghost contributions , we proceed as in @xcite .",
    "for the matter contribution , we use that for an exponential shape function it is straightforward to evaluate the functional traces via an inverse laplace transform ; for details , see appendix [ matterbetacontr ] .    in the following , we will use a spectrally and rg adjusted regulator @xcite of the form with exponential shape function @xmath100 .",
    "therein @xmath101 is understood to be a placeholder for the eigenvalues of the differential operator constituting the kinetic term , evaluated on the appropriate background . as an example , for the evaluation of @xmath64 , @xmath101 is to be understood as the momentum , whereas @xmath102 with @xmath103 being the laplacian on a maximally symmetric space of positive curvature for the evaluation of @xmath104 and @xmath65 .",
    "note that our choice of regulator implies that the right - hand side of the flow equation will depend on @xmath105 , @xmath106 and @xmath97 , but not on @xmath107 and @xmath108 .    to obtain the anomalous dimension",
    ", we apply the following projection rule : @xmath109    to evaluate the @xmath0 functions for the matter couplings we employ the following projection rules , where the numerical coefficients arise due to the differing tensor structure of the four matter couplings : @xmath110    for further details , and the appropriate vertices for the evaluation of the @xmath0 functions , see appendix [ appendix1 ] .",
    "let us first set @xmath77 and thereby switch off metric fluctuations to briefly examine the pure matter truncation .",
    "as expected , it admits a gauian fixed point with critical exponents @xmath111 as corresponding to the canonical dimensionality .",
    "further , we also find several non - gauian fixed points in the system .",
    "these have in common , that at all of these , at least one of the couplings @xmath112 has a negative value , thus corresponding to an unstable direction of the euclidean action .",
    "this does however not imply that these fixed points should be discarded , since clearly higher - order operators beyond our truncation , such as @xmath113 operators will be induced .",
    "thus , the euclidean action in an extended truncation could be bounded from below even at negative values of the @xmath99 and @xmath78 .    in tab .",
    "[ fptablewograv ] , we list the fixed points in this truncation ; discarding further spurious fixed points since their rather large anomalous dimension suggests that terms beyond our truncation will crucially alter these .",
    ".[fptablewograv ] here we list the fixed - point values , as well as the value of the anomalous dimension @xmath105 and the critical exponents at the various fixed points at @xmath77 .",
    "we find the gauian fixed point , as well as two non - gauian ones , where the first has two relevant directions .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     since the momentum - independent coupling @xmath78 is negative at the fixed point , the euclidean effective potential seems unbounded from below .",
    "here it is important to realise that higher - order terms in the scalar field will be induced by metric and scalar fluctuations . these can result in a bounded effective potential , even for @xmath114 .",
    "thus we can not discard this fixed point on the grounds of stability .",
    "the mechanism , why the shifted gauian fixed point in the matter couplings vanishes completely for larger values of @xmath115 and @xmath82 , but not the non - gauian one , is simple to understand : whereas the effect of metric fluctuations is to shift the matter @xmath0 function in such a direction as to induce the vanishing of fixed points , matter fluctuations have the opposite effect : the pure matter system admits the existence of non - trivial fixed points .",
    "thus the only scenario in which a full fixed point can survive the onset of metric fluctuation is one where the matter sector itself is strongly interacting , since then clearly the effect of metric fluctuations is less dominant than at the gauian matter fixed point .",
    "we thus arrive at the following conclusion : in a scalar theory coupled to asymptotically safe quantum gravity , there is no gauian matter fixed point . for very small values of @xmath115",
    "it becomes shifted into an interacting fixed point .",
    "finally , at larger values of @xmath115 , where the gravitational @xmath0 functions have fixed points , the shifted gauian fixed point in the matter sector does not exist any more ( i.e. the zeros of the @xmath0 function lie in the complex plane away from the real axis ) .",
    "there is a fully non - gauian fixed point at larger values of the matter couplings .",
    "canonical power - counting does not hold at this fixed point , due to the large fixed - point values .",
    "we conclude that in constructing a quantum theory of gravitational and matter degrees of freedom based on asymptotic safety the fact that the gravitational sector remains interacting in the uv implies that there will be a strongly - coupled matter sector . within our truncation",
    "we find no evidence for a picture where the far uv is dominated by metric fluctuations only , and the matter sector becomes trivial .",
    "in contrast , the uv behaviour of the theory is determined by an interacting matter and gravity theory , where metric fluctuations induce non - vanishing matter couplings , and accordingly matter fluctuations become important and drive the running couplings in both sectors .",
    "interestingly , none of the matter couplings is shifted into relevance , although quantum fluctuations induce large departures from canonical scaling .",
    "this is also reflected in the large anomalous dimension @xmath105 .",
    "note however , that two of the critical exponents are rather close to zero .",
    "it is thus conceivable , that similar shifts in couplings of canonical dimensionality @xmath116 result in these couplings becoming relevant .",
    "therefore , extended truncations of scalar matter coupled to gravity might exhibit more relevant couplings than the sum of relevant couplings in the gravitational and the matter sector considered separately .",
    "we observe that since this fixed point is dominated by matter fluctuations , the anomalous dimension for the scalar is positive .",
    "let us discuss the dependence of our results on the choice of regulator : here , we employ a spectrally adjusted cutoff , that implies the existence of terms @xmath117 on the right - hand side of the flow - equation .",
    "these terms result in a clearly non - perturbative structure of the flow equation , since @xmath105 will also depend on the inverse of the matter couplings , see app .",
    "[ anomdimapp ] . in yang - mills",
    "theory , this structure is crucial to uncover the existence of an infrared attractive non - gauian fixed point , see @xcite . + a regulator of this type has also been employed in @xcite to evaluate the ghost anomalous dimension in asymptotic safety , as compared to a non - spectrally adjusted one for the evaluation of the same quantity in @xcite . in the same choice of gauge ,",
    "the difference in regularisation scheme yielded @xmath118 vs. @xmath119 .",
    "this exemplifies that numerical differences follow from the use of one versus the other regularisation scheme , but important conclusions , in particular about the relevance of couplings , are not affected .",
    "most importantly , as has been pointed out in @xcite , there exists a choice of non - spectrally adjusted cutoff which reproduces the fixed - point values found with a spectrally adjusted cutoff .",
    "we thus conclude that our main results on the existence of fixed points and most importantly the critical exponents should not be affected by a change in the cutoff procedure .",
    "since new matter - couplings are induced by metric fluctuations , it is interesting to investigate their backreaction onto the gravitational sector .",
    "this is another test of the consistency of the asymptotic - safety scenario : to decide whether a fixed point is an artifact of a truncation , or exists in full theory space , it is useful to investigate its stability under extensions of the truncation .",
    "furthermore , the numerical values of the critical exponents are a good measure of the stability of the fixed point under such extensions .",
    "numerous results exist showing the stability of the fixed point under various extensions of the truncation @xcite . here",
    ", we add further evidence , by including the couplings @xmath120 and @xmath99 into the flow of @xmath115 and @xmath82 . at a first glance",
    ", one would not expect a backcoupling of @xmath99 into the gravitational @xmath0 functions @xmath121 and @xmath65 , since the terms @xmath94 in the effective action do not contribute to the scalar two - point function at vanishing scalar field , see also sect .",
    "[ calculation ] .",
    "however the @xmath99 contribute to @xmath105 , which does of course enter the gravitational @xmath0 functions .",
    "since @xmath10 corresponds to an inessential coupling , it can be eliminated from the other @xmath0 functions , by simply inserting @xmath122 . in this fashion",
    "the @xmath99 enter @xmath104 and @xmath65 , and can thus alter the rg flow of @xmath115 and @xmath82 .    as a result",
    ", we point out that the rg flow projected onto the einstein - hilbert subsector @xmath123 is very stable under this extension of the truncation . as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ ehplot ] , changing the value of the matter couplings considerably only leads to a very slight change in the fixed - point values and the structure of the rg flow in the einstein - hilbert sector .",
    "in particular , our extended truncation again permits to choose initial conditions for the rg flow within the uv - critical surface of the ngfp which give a trajectory with a long classical regime , see fig .",

    "inflation with a scalar field within asymptotically safe quantum gravity has been studied in @xcite .",
    "the main conclusion is that inflation and a scale - invariant spectrum of scalar perturbations are possible in such a setting .",
    "as is known , derivative interactions do not alter the slow - roll conditions for inflation , since within the standard scenario , the classical background value of the scalar field is constant over space , and @xmath128 . clearly adding any type of derivative - interaction to the potential respects these conditions .",
    "momentum - dependent interaction terms have been studied in the context of inflation , see , e.g. @xcite .",
    "thus our result , that metric fluctuations generate momentum - dependent scalar interactions , will not affect the conclusion that asymptotically safe quantum gravity can admit inflation with a scalar field .",
    "interestingly , one of the operators that we investigate here , namely @xmath129 has been shown @xcite to potentially give larger non - gauianities in the spectrum of the scalar field fluctuations than in the standard slow - roll inflation without this additional term @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , the result for the non - gauianity parameter @xmath130 and the bispectrum @xmath131 of the scalar perturbations are defined via the fouriertransform of the two- and the three - point function , modulo a @xmath132 function for momentum - conservation .",
    "then the simplest measure for non - gauianity is @xmath133 .",
    "] is @xmath134 .",
    "the value for @xmath130 thus depends on the identification of @xmath11 : evaluating the three - point function of the scalar field fluctuations during inflation requires the identification of the rg scale @xmath11 with a physical scale of the system . here",
    ", a possible choice is @xmath135 where @xmath136 is the hubble scale during inflation , see , e.g. @xcite and references therein .",
    "the precise scale - identification is crucial for a quantitatively meaningful prediction of the non - gaussianity .",
    "since asymptotically safe quantum gravity necessitates the existence of such a term , this effect could in principle be an observable consequence of asymptotic safety with experiments .",
    "+ for a prediction of the numerical value of @xmath130 , the flow of @xmath137 on a trajectory potentially describing our universe is necessary . in particular",
    "this will crucially depend on terms beyond our truncation , such as @xmath138 terms , which give a direct contribution to @xmath139 .    in a more general setting",
    ", fluctuations of the metric generate this term within the effective - field theory setting .",
    "since it leaves an observable imprint in the cmb , measurements of the non - gauianity allow us in principle to access the rg flow of newton s coupling and the cosmological constant in other quantum gravity proposals . in more detail ,",
    "the idea is the following one : different quantum gravity proposals differ in the choice of their fundamental variables , the realisation of fundamental symmetries etc .",
    "thus the `` pure quantum gravity regime '' , in which even the notion of a continuous spacetime is often postulated to break down , looks widely different in distinct quantum gravity proposals .",
    "they agree on the necessity to recover classical einstein gravity at small momentum ( large length ) scales .",
    "presumably there is a regime between a `` pure quantum gravity regime '' and the classical regime , in which quantum gravity fluctuations start to be important , but they can be calculated within a framework , in which the symmetries of einstein gravity hold , and the metric is used as an effective degree of freedom .",
    "this regime is a semiclassical regime , where our calculation holds , and it presumably dominates energy scales at which inflation takes place . within this regime , the rg framework can be applied .",
    "the crucial point to realise is that different proposals for quantum gravity will translate into different initial ( i.e. high - energy ) values for the couplings , at which the rg flow will start . in order for",
    "the quantum gravity proposal to be realised in our universe , the rg flow must reach a region where @xmath140 on small momentum scales .",
    "on scales slightly below the initial uv scale , the values of different couplings can be very different for different quantum gravity proposals .",
    "what they all have in common is the generation of matter - interaction terms such as the one that we have investigated here .",
    "thus many proposals for quantum gravity , different as they may be in the very far uv , will all generate a non - zero value for @xmath141 at energy scales presumably below the planck scales . bridging the gap between the fundamental description and the effective - field theory description",
    "then allows to predict as specific rg trajectory @xmath142 for a specific uv completion .",
    "as @xmath141 is in principle accessible to observations in the non - gauianity of the cmb , we can in principle use this observation to infer the rg trajectory of the newton coupling and the cosmological constant .",
    "thus different uv completions for gravity can be distinguished at the level of observation .",
    "we have studied quantum gravity coupled to matter , and shown that in the case of a scalar field , quantum gravity fluctuations , which we parameterise as metric fluctuations , generate scalar self - interactions when coupled to gravity .",
    "we point out that this is a generic feature of quantum gravity fluctuations : whenever a free matter field theory is coupled to gravity , the @xmath8 generates matter - graviton vertices , and graviton loops generate matter self - interactions , in particular in the non - perturbative regime .",
    "here we have shown that in the case of a scalar field , the induced interactions are momentum dependent , and thus have the form @xmath143 , @xmath144 and @xmath145 with @xmath146 .",
    "most importantly , these matter self - interactions also couple into the flow of the scalar effective potential , and remove the gauian fixed point in the scalar momentum - independent coupling @xmath78 . thus we conclude that quantum gravity fluctuations alter the properties and the dynamics of matter systems .",
    "+ let us stress that this result holds within asymptotically safe quantum gravity , but also in an effective - field - theory setting , where the uv completion for gravity is not specified .",
    "we thus conclude , that quantum gravity effects generically alter the properties and dynamics of matter theories in comparison to the gravity - free case .",
    "as shown in a previous work @xcite , a similar mechanism is at work when fermions are coupled minimally to gravity : starting with only a minimally coupled kinetic term , four - fermion interactions are induced , even if these four - fermion couplings are set to zero initially . due to the dimensionality of @xmath147 of a fermion field , the induced fermionic self - interactions are not momentum - dependent in this case .",
    "let us comment on the interesting case of gauge fields coupled to gravity , studied in @xcite , which is the subject of future work : in a similar way to what we observed here , higher - order gauge - field self - interactions will presumably be generated .",
    "since there is no symmetry to forbid the generation of these terms , only a highly non - trivial cancellation mechanism between diagrams could avoid the generation of some of the infinitely many @xmath148 terms . in principle , quantum gravity effects could even lead to an unstable matter action , thus excluding this type of uv completion for gravity .",
    "let us also note that a similar mechanism is expected to be at work in a first - order formulation of gravity , as examined in @xcite in the context of asymptotic safety .",
    "noting that the metric - induced matter interactions can alter the dynamics of matter fields at high momenta , and also potentially increase the number of relevant couplings , and thus the free parameters of the theory , one might wonder if there is a way to avoid this mechanism . at a first glance , unimodular quantum gravity @xcite ,",
    "where @xmath8 is held fixed , and which , at the classical level is equivalent to general relativity , might provide a solution : one might think that holding @xmath8 fixed avoids the generation of matter - graviton - interaction vertices from a free theory .",
    "however this is only partially right , since kinetic terms usually contain further factors of the metric .",
    "even if the covariant derivative reduces to a partial derivative , as in the case of a scalar field , further factors of the inverse metric exist ( as in @xmath149 ) .",
    "these can be expanded in an infinite series in the fluctuation metric , thus again generating metric - matter interactions , which induce matter self - interactions through loop diagrams .",
    "we conclude that the mechanism which generates matter self - interactions when a free matter theory is coupled to gravity , seems to be rather generic , and can presumably not be avoided for any type of matter , be it scalar , fermionic or spin-1 .    within our truncation",
    ", we find the following interesting results : metric fluctuations shift the so - called gauian matter fixed point to make it an interacting one , where momentum - dependent interaction terms have non - zero couplings and also induce a non - vanishing value for the momentum - independent coupling @xmath78 . first treating the ( dimensionless ) newton coupling @xmath115 and the cosmological constant @xmath82 as external parameters , we find two fixed points in the matter @xmath0 functions which are connected continuously to the gauian fixed point for @xmath150 and which exist for small values of @xmath82 and @xmath115 .",
    "most importantly , the critical exponent of the matter couplings at the fixed points are changed considerably in comparison to the gauian case , and in fact @xmath78 can turn into a relevant coupling .",
    "studying the full system of @xmath0 functions for @xmath151 we note that the shfited gauian fixed points cease to exist : they exist for small values of @xmath115 , but since metric fluctuations have the effect shifting the matter @xmath0 functions such that fixed points tend to be removed , values around @xmath152 are too big in order for the shifted gauian fixed point to exist .",
    "in the full truncation , only a non - gauian fixed point with large values of the matter couplings exist .",
    "in the limit @xmath150 , where metric fluctuations are turned off , it is not continuously connected to the gauian fixed point . at this non - gauian fixed points ,",
    "the matter couplings remain irrelevant , but the critical exponents deviate from the power - counting dimensionality of the couplings .",
    "the gravitational couplings correspond to relevant directions .",
    "thus our 6-coupling theory space admits a uv completion which is fully interacting and has two free parameters .",
    "we therefore conclude that within asymptotically safe quantum gravity , it is crucial to take into account the metric - induced matter self - interactions , since their existence implies that in the far uv , both gravitational as well as matter couplings are non - zero and therefore both sector contribute to the rg flow .",
    "most importantly , the critical exponents deviate significantly from the canonical scaling dimensions .",
    "we thus conclude , that within a more extended truncation , matter couplings with negative canonical dimensionality could even be shifted into relevance .",
    "note furthermore that matter self - interactions generically couple back into the flow of the gravitational couplings . in our case , this happens since the anomalous dimension @xmath105 , which couples into @xmath121 and @xmath65 , depends on the @xmath99 .",
    "potentially , gravity - induced matter self - interactions can then crucially alter the rg flow in the gravitational sector . in the truncation investigated here ,",
    "the change of the gravitational rg flow in comparison to the matter - free case is only mild , but a complete study of the gravitational rg flow must take into account the metric - induced matter self - interactions .",
    "future directions of this work should obviously include extension of the truncation in the matter sector , but also resolve the single - metric approximation and account for the bimetric nature of the rg flow in the backgrounf - field formalism in gravity . finally , further matter fields , that in more realistic toy models of the standard model obviously couple to both gravity as well as the scalar sector , can also have a crucial effect on the fixed - point structure in the uv .    note also that the mechanism that we explained here , also applies to faddeev - popov ghosts fields , which arise in the context of gauge - fixing .",
    "metric fluctuations can be expected to generate further terms involving ghost fields beyond the simple exponential of the faddeev - popov determinant .",
    "it should be expected that the ghost sector of asymptotically safe quantum gravity differs significantly from a perturbative ghost sector .",
    "whether this allows for a solution of the gribov problem in quantum gravity remains to be investigated .",
    "we point out that momentum - dependent scalar interaction terms as the one investigated here have been examined in the context of inflation : assuming that the slow - roll conditions for a scalar field are satisfied , this type of term is also allowed .",
    "however it does have interesting consequences for possible observations , since it can induce larger non - gauianities in the cmb than within a standard slow - roll scenario .",
    "we conclude that , although quantitative precision can not be expected from our truncation , asymptotically safe quantum gravity might be expected to leave a potentially observable imprint in large non - gauianities in the cmb , which might be observable .",
