    "the heavy quark limit of qcd and , more generally , heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , has aroused an enormous interest in the decade of the 1990 s , starting from the formulation of heavy quark symmetry by isgur and wise @xcite .",
    "hadrons with one heavy quark such that @xmath10 can be thought as a bound state of a light cloud in the color source of the heavy quark . due to its heavy mass , the latter is unaffected by the interaction with soft gluons .    in this approximation ,",
    "the decay of a heavy hadron with four - velocity @xmath11 into another hadron with velocity @xmath12 , for example the semileptonic decay @xmath13 or @xmath1 , occurs just by free heavy quark decay produced by a current , and the rearrangement of the light cloud , to follow the heavy quark in the final state and constitute the final heavy hadron .    the dynamics is contained in the complicated light cloud , that concerns long distance qcd and is not calculable from first principles .",
    "therefore , one needs to parametrize this physics through form factors , the iw functions .",
    "the matrix element of a current between heavy hadrons containing heavy quarks @xmath14 and @xmath15 can thus be factorized as follows @xcite @xmath16 [ 1e ] < cloud , v,j,m|cloud , v , j , m > where @xmath11 , @xmath12 are the initial and final four - velocities , and @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 are the angular momenta and corresponding projections of the initial and final light clouds , and @xmath21 are the angular momentum projections of the heavy quark .",
    "the current affects only the heavy quark , and all the soft dynamics is contained in the _ overlap _ between the initial and final light clouds @xmath22 , that follow the heavy quarks with the same four - velocity .",
    "this overlap is independent of the current heavy quark matrix element , and depends on the four - velocities @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "the iw functions are given by these light clouds overlaps .",
    "an important hypothesis has been done in writing the previous expression , namely neglecting _",
    "hard gluon radiative corrections_.    as we will make explicit below , the light cloud belongs to a hilbert space , and transforms according to a unitary representation of the lorentz group .",
    "then , as we have shown in @xcite , the whole problem of getting rigorous constraints on the iw functions amounts to decompose unitary representations of the lorentz group into irreducible ones .",
    "this allows to obtain for the iw functions general integral formulas in which the crucial point is that _ the measures are positive_.    in @xcite we did treat the case of a light cloud with angular momentum @xmath23 in the initial and final states , as happens in the baryon semileptonic decay @xmath1 .    a different but , as we will show below , equivalent method to the one of the present paper was developed in a number of articles using _ sum rules _ in the heavy quark limit , like the famous bjorken sum rule and its generalizations @xcite .",
    "the sum rule method is completely equivalent to the method of the present paper . indeed",
    ", starting from the sum rules one can demonstrate that an iw function , say @xmath24 in a simplified notation , is a function of _ positive type _ , and that one can construct a unitary representation of the lorentz group @xmath25 and a vector state @xmath26 representing the light cloud at rest .",
    "the iw function writes then simply ( e.g. in the special case @xmath23 ) : [ 1bise ] ( v.v ) =  < u(b_v)_0|u(b_v)_0 > where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the corresponding boosts .",
    "let us now go back to previous work on the sum rule method . in the meson case @xmath13 , in the leading order of the heavy quark expansion , bjorken sum rule ( sr ) @xcite@xcite",
    "gives the lower bound for the derivative of the iw function at zero recoil @xmath29 .",
    "a new sr was formulated by uraltsev in the heavy quark limit @xcite that , combined with bjorken s , gave the much stronger lower bound @xmath30 . a basic ingredient in deriving this bound was the consideration of the non - forward amplitude @xmath31 , allowing for general four - velocities @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath12 .",
    "in @xcite we did develop a manifestly covariant formalism within the operator product expansion ( ope ) and the non - forward amplitude , using the whole tower of heavy meson states @xcite .",
    "we did recover uraltsev sr plus a general class of sr that allow to bound also higher derivatives of the iw function .",
    "in particular , we found a bound on the curvature in terms of the slope @xmath34 , namely [ 2e ] ",
    "( 1 )    the more powerful method of the present paper will provide a new insight on the physics of qcd in the heavy quark limit and on its lorentz group structure .    as we will see below",
    ", we obtain an integral formula for the isgur - wise function in terms of a _ positive measure_. we will see that we recover the bound ( [ 2e ] ) and that this systematic method allows to find bounds for higher derivatives .",
    "we can invert this integral formula and obtain the measure corresponding to any given ansatz for the iw function and we obtain thus a powerful criterium to decide if this ansatz is consistent with the lorentz group approach or , equivalently , with the generalized bjorken - uraltsev sum rules .",
    "the method exposed in this paper allows to decide if a given model for the iw function is consistent or not with general principles of qcd in the heavy quark limit .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is purely theoretical . in hqet , e.g. in @xmath35 transitions , one can take the heavy quark limit for both initial and final quarks while keeping finite the mass ratio @xmath36 . varying the ratio",
    "@xmath37 one can in principle attain any value for the variable @xmath6 within the range @xmath38 , and our theoretical constraints on iw functions are then valid for any value of @xmath6 .",
    "of course , this is quite different from the physical range at finite masses , namely @xmath39 gev . to perform an analysis at finite mass",
    "would ask not only to implement the theoretical constraints on the iw function obtained in the present work . one would need to perform a serious phenomenological discussion and to include @xmath40 corrections , radiative corrections within the effective theory hqet , and make use of the wilson coefficients to make the matching with the true qcd , as has been done for the curvature of the iw function ( [ 2e ] ) by m. dorsten @xcite .",
    "this whole program is outside the intention of the present work , that only deals with rigorous constraints on the shape of the iw function .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "sections 2 and 3 recall necessary generalities and details on the present lorentz group approach to iw functions , following closely ref .",
    "@xcite . in section 4",
    "we particularize the method exposed in detail in @xcite to the present meson case , making explicit the needed unitary representations of the lorentz group . in section 5",
    "we compute the irreducible iw functions in the case @xmath9 and give an integral formula expressing the iw function in terms of the latter and a positive mesure . in section 6",
    "we use this integral formula to get a polynomial expression for the derivatives of the iw function , and in section 7 we obtain lower bounds on its derivatives .",
    "section 8 is devoted to obtain the inversion of the integral formula for the iw function . in section 9",
    "we find an _ upper bound _ on the iw function . in section 10 we apply the inverted integral formula to study consistency tests of a number of models of the iw function proposed in the literature . the bakamjian - thomas relativistic quark model in the heavy quark limit and the description of the lorentz group representation that underlies this model is studied in detail in section 11 . in section 12",
    "we discuss the theoretical and phenomenological relevance of our results , and we conclude .",
    "in the heavy mass limit , the states of a heavy hadron @xmath41 containing a heavy quark @xmath14 is described as follows @xcite , as we can see from ( [ 1e ] ) : [ 3e ] |h(v),,m >  = |q(v ) , >  |v , j , m > where there is factorization into the heavy quark state factor @xmath42 and a light cloud component @xmath43 .",
    "the velocity @xmath11 of the heavy hadron h is the same as the velocity of the heavy quark @xmath14 , and is unquantized .",
    "the heavy quark @xmath14 state depends only on a spin @xmath44 quantum number , and so belongs to a 2-dimensional hilbert space .",
    "the light component is the complicated thing , but it does not depend on the spin state @xmath45 of the heavy quark @xmath14 , nor on its mass , and this gives rise to the symmetries of the heavy quark theory .    as advanced in the introduction , the matrix element of a heavy - heavy current @xmath46 ( acting only on the heavy quark ) writes    @xmath47 [ 4e ] and the iw functions are defined as the coefficients , depending only on @xmath48 , in the expansion of the unknown scalar products @xmath22 into independent scalars constructed from @xmath11 , @xmath12 and the polarization tensors describing the spin states of the light components .    now , the crucial point in the present work is that _ the states of the light components make up a hilbert space in which acts a unitary representation of the lorentz group_. in fact , this is more or less implicitly stated , and used in the literature @xcite .      to see the point more clearly ,",
    "let us go into the physical picture which is at the basis of ( [ 3e ] ) .",
    "considering first a heavy hadron _ at rest _",
    ", with velocity    [ 4bise ] v_0 = ( 1 , ) its light component is submitted to the interactions between the light particles , light quarks , light antiquarks and gluons , and to the external chromo - electric field generated by the heavy quarks at rest .",
    "this chromo - electric field does not depend on the spin @xmath45 of the heavy quark nor on its mass .",
    "we shall then have a complete orthonormal system of energy eigenstates @xmath49 of the light component , where @xmath17 and @xmath19 are the angular momentum quantum numbers and @xmath50 designs other quantum numbers ( like the radial excitation number ) , [ 5e ] < v_0,j,m,|v_0,j , m , >  = _ j , j _ m , m _ ,",
    "    now , for a heavy hadron moving with a velocity @xmath11 , the only thing which changes for the light component is that the external chromo - electric field generated by the heavy quark at rest is replaced by the external chromo - electromagnetic field generated by the heavy quark moving with velocity @xmath11 . neither the hilbert space describing the possible states of the light component , nor the interactions between the light particles , are changed .",
    "we shall then have _ a new complete orthonormal system _ of energy eigenstates @xmath51 , in the same hilbert space . then , because the colour fields generated by a heavy quark for different velocities are related by lorentz transformations , we may expect that the energy eigenstates of the light component will , for various velocities , be themselves related by lorentz transformations acting in their hilbert space .",
    "let us now show that such a representation of the lorentz group does in fact underly the work of ref",
    "the description of spin states by polarization tensors is used .    for half - integer spin @xmath17 ,",
    "in which we are interested in the present paper , the polarization tensor becomes a rarita - schwinger tensor - spinor @xmath52 subject to the constraints of symmetry , transversality and tracelessness [ 6e ] v__1 ^_1, ...",

    "the iw functions , functions of the scalar @xmath48 , are introduced accordingly .",
    "the covariance property of the scalar products is explicitly expressed by the equality [ 8e ] < v,j,|v , j , >  =  < v,j,|v , j , > valid for any lorentz transformation @xmath56 , with the transformation of a tensor - spinor given by [ 10e ] ( ) ^_1, ... ,_j-1/2_= ^_1__1 ... ^_j-1/2__j-1/2 d ( ) _  ^_1, ... ,_j-1/2 _    then , let us _",
    "define _ the operator @xmath25 , in the space of the light cloud states , by [ 11e ] u()|v , j , >  = |v , j , > where here @xmath11 is a fixed , arbitrarily chosen velocity .",
    "( [ 8e ] ) implies that @xmath25 is a",
    "_ unitary operator _ , as demonstrated in @xcite .",
    "a unitary representation of the lorentz group emerges thus from the usual treatment of heavy hadrons in the heavy quark theory . for the present purpose",
    ", we need to go in the opposite way , namely , to show how , starting from a unitary representation of the lorentz group , the usual treatment of heavy hadrons and the introduction of the iw functions emerges .",
    "what follows is not restricted to the @xmath57 case , but concerns any iw function .",
    "so , let us consider some unitary representation @xmath58 of the lorentz group , or more precisely of the group @xmath59 , in a hilbert space @xmath60 , and we have to identify states in @xmath60 , depending on a velocity @xmath11 . as explained in @xcite , we have in @xmath60 an additional structure , namely the energy operator of the light component _ for a heavy quark at rest _ , with @xmath61 . since this energy operator is invariant under rotations",
    ", we consider the subgroup @xmath62 of @xmath59 . by restriction",
    ", the representation in @xmath60 of @xmath59 gives a representation @xmath63 of @xmath62 , and its decomposition into irreducible representations of @xmath62 is needed .",

    "we may then introduce a standard basis @xmath71 , @xmath68 , for the @xmath62 representation of spin @xmath17 in the space of polarization 3-tensors ( or 3-tensor - spinors ) .",

    "therefore each @xmath76 admits an orthonormal basis adapted to @xmath62 .",

    "we have studied in detail the bakamjian - thomas relativistic quark model applied to mesons in the heavy quark limit .",
    "to this aim we have described the lorentz group representation that underlies the model .",
    "we formulate the form of the wave functions of the light cloud for all quantum numbers , and provide the formalism to obtain the iw functions by scalar products of these states .",
    "consistently , the elastic iw function in this model satisfies all the lorentz group criteria , and this feature holds for any explicit form of the hamiltonian describing the meson spectrum at rest .",
    "completeness in the hilbert space implies the strong result that the full set fo bjorken - like heavy quark limit sum rules is automatically satisfied in the bt model at infinite mass .    in conclusion , using a method based on the lorentz group , completely equivalent to the one of the generalized bjorken - uraltsev sum rules , we have obtained in this paper strong constraints on the isgur - wise function for the ground state mesons .",
