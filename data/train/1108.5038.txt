    "to address the effect of voids on evolution of the lowest mass dwarf galaxies , we compiled a sample of @xmath280 late - type galaxies in one of the nearest voids , the lynx - cancer void ( paper  i  * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "due to the void s relative proximity ( @xmath13 @xmath218  mpc ) , galaxies in this volume selected for the sdss spectroscopy , have the absolute magnitudes as low as @xmath14 . galaxies residing in the lynx - cancer void ( as well as those in other voids )",
    ", are mostly dwarfs ( @xmath295% , paper  i ) .",
    "there exists the well known correlation between galaxy luminosities and their central surface brightnesses ( sb ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the deeper one probes the void galaxy population , the higher fraction of lsb galaxies one expects .",
    "however , the severe observational selection effects prevents a good completeness sample of the low - luminosity lsb galaxies .    in the sdss ,",
    "a relatively high surface brightness cut - off has been used to select the spectroscopic targets .",
    "namely , the completeness of the sdss galaxy samples with the measured redshifts falls below 50% for objects with the half - light @xmath15 23.5  mag  arcsec@xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this limit for the purely exponential face - on discs , roughly corresponds to the observed value of the central sb in @xmath17-band  @xmath18",
    "23.2  mag  arcsec@xmath16 ( paper  i ) .",
    "hence , the resulting sdss galaxy samples with known redshifts are biased against the lsb galaxies in the nearby metagalaxy .",
    "the apparent brightening due to the inclination effect and the presence of extra light related to the sf regions ( or bulges ) , will somewhat diminish the loss of galaxies with @xmath19 @xmath20 24  mag  arcsec@xmath16 .",
    "however , for galaxies with @xmath21 24  mag  arcsec@xmath16 , the sdss selection criterion should lead to the substantial loss of lsb dwarf galaxies in the void galaxy samples . here",
    "the indexes @xmath22 and @xmath23 correspond to the galaxy foreground extinction and the inclination corrected values .",
    "some of these missing galaxies might form the youngest local galaxy population @xcite .",
    "the lsb galaxies are believed to evolve slower than the brighter counterparts with similar masses .",
    "this occurs due to their lower surface mass density and the larger stabilisations effect of their dm halos that suppress the internal perturbations and the related gas collapse and sf process .",
    "their properties are also related to the higher specific angular momentum @xcite . in turn , as cosmological simulations show , the primordial halos with the higher specific angular momentum collapse late and their baryonic gas can form lsbgs with substantial delays .",
    "furthermore , the same properties of lsbgs can eliminate the effect of collisions and tidal perturbations , significantly reducing the induced sf in comparison to the processes in the similar high - sb galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) . on the other hand",
    ", @xcite suggested that the blue colours of the lsb dwarfs can be understood as a result of starbursts triggered by distant / weak tidal encounters .",
    "similarly , @xcite argued that the blue colours of lsbgs are related to the weak sf bursts , caused by encounters have occurred during the last five gyr .    in order to better disentangle various effects of galaxy interactions , one needs to know how the isolated galaxies evolve .",
    "the study of isolated galaxies became rather popular especially in the last years , e.g. , amiga project ( ) , by the creation of new samples of isolated galaxies - the local orphan galaxies sample @xcite , 2mig sample @xcite and the multiwavelength study of the sample of the most isolated galaxies in the more distant voids @xcite .",
    "also , since galaxies are complex systems , the separating of the most extreme ( ` purified ' from the confusing factors ) galaxies , in which one finds the simplest physical and dynamical conditions , helps to confront the numerical simulations of physical processes in galaxies with the real objects and to verify the model assumptions .    in this context , the very gas - rich and very metal - poor lsb galaxies residing in voids , can appear to be the simplest objects for the understanding and modelling of their dynamics , star formation and evolution .",
    "the understanding of various aspects of their lives can be the good baseline for the analysis of more complicated cases and might give the keys for the insights into a more common aggregates and with a more complex structure ( in respect of the baryon component mix , spiral waves and bars , etc ) .",
    "is the very rarefied environment , characteristic of voids , important for the lsbg evolution ?",
    "can we find any significant difference in the evolutionary status between the lsb dwarfs residing in voids and in groups and/or in the general field ?    during the systematic study of the dwarf galaxies in the lynx - cancer void , we have already discovered several unusual objects , including the almost completed merger in the very metal - poor galaxy ddo  68 @xcite , the interacting pair of the blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) hs  0822 + 3542 and the lsb dwarf sao  0822 + 3545 @xcite , and the very lsb dwarf sdss j0926 + 3343 @xcite . in this paper",

    "this implies that the galaxies are in a rather high - velocity encounter . the higher spectral resolution spectrum ( with fwhm=5.5   ) of j0723 + 3621 is insufficient for a good quality rotation curve in h@xmath43 .",
    "however , this permits a determination of the direction of rotation and to obtain a rough estimate of its amplitude : the eastern edge is receding and the full amplitude of rotation is @xmath240  km  s@xmath6  at the radial distances @xmath1017 .",

    "however , the second peak , containing approximately the same amount of hi - flux , does not change for this pointing as one could expect .",
    "this suggests that the hi  gas responsible for the emission in this velocity range is situated mid - way between the two galaxies and probably represents a strong tidal bridge . since the total luminosity of j0723 + 3622 in @xmath17-band is only @xmath21/8 of that for j0723 + 3621 , the strong tidal effect in this collision poses the question on the relative total masses of both galaxies .",

    "the hi  mapping of the system should help to better estimate the dynamical mass of j0723 + 3622 .",

    "many such dwarf galaxies are collected in the figgs sample @xcite .",

    "a newly identified by @xcite very metal - poor lsb galaxy eso  546-g34 ( 12+@xmath3(o / h ) @xmath27.4  dex ) , probably resembles the discussed here lsb dwarfs , but its environment is not studied .    the statistics of lsbds with well known o / h and the good photometry is not yet large enough to check the impact of lsb galaxies on to the slope and the zero - point of ` o / h vs @xmath60 ' relationship . as shown in paper  ii , the effect of the global environment on to the dwarf galaxy metallicity does exist .",
    "therefore , to probe the effect of lsb in galaxies , one needs to separate a lsb sample in a more typical global environment .",
    "four of the eight ` extreme ' void galaxies fall significantly below the lower dashed line . in this sense",
    "they are indeed xmd ( extremely metal - deficient ) as defined by @xcite .",
    "that is their values of o / h are 3 - 7 times lower than those for typical similar galaxies residing in denser environments .",
    "this is indicative of their unusual evolutionary history .    in the right panel",
    "we show a similar plot , ` o / h vs @xmath0(hi ) ' where the hydrogen mass @xmath0(hi ) is used as a surrogate of the total baryonic mass . here",
    "the scatter of the control lsbd sample is larger . but",
    "again , the three lynx - cancer void galaxies with the lowest metallicities and sdss j0015 + 0104 show o / h significantly smaller than their analogs from denser environment regions with the same gas mass .",
    "we have checked how the parameters of these extreme void lsbds match to the correlations between the main parameters of the es sample of hi  identified galaxies from @xcite on their plots @xmath50 vs @xmath137 , @xmath138(g ) vs @xmath137 , @xmath0(hi ) vs @xmath139(g ) , @xmath140(hi ) vs @xmath137 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : es_compar]a , b , c , d we show respectively the sketches of their figures 15 , 16 , 17 and 19 with the data for our void galaxies overlaid . for two faint companion lsbds without hi - flux estimates we adopted conditionally the same @xmath0(hi)/@xmath141 ratios as for their brighter counterparts .",
    "the luminosities and hydrogen masses as well as the hi  profile widths of the considered void lsbds appear on the lower edges of the respective es sample distribution or even outside these ranges .",
    "but in none of these plots the void galaxies in the question show the deviations larger than the typical scatter of es sample galaxies from their general trends .",
    "this suggests that the global properties of the void lsbds are similar to the those of the dimmest , ` inchoate ' part of the es sample .",
    "currently neither metallicities , nor the global environment are known for these inchoate es galaxies . in principle",
    ", they can be the full analogs of the void lowest metallicity lsbds . in the case of their o / h are higher and closer to the ` standard ' ` o / h vs @xmath60 ' relationship , they can be just more evolutionary advanced cousins of rather rare ` extreme ' void lsbds .",
    "the study of both parameters , o / h and global environment of the inchoate es galaxies will help to understand the possible relation between the unusual lynx - cancer void galaxies and the specific subsamples of galaxies separated in large ` unbiased ' surveys .    completing the issue of unusual lsbds residing in this void ,",
    "we emphasize their high spatial concentration .",
    "the full volume of this void with diameter @xmath142  mpc is @xmath21.5 times larger than that for the local volume defined in @xcite as a sphere with @xmath143  mpc , containing @xmath2450 galaxies with known distances .",
    "most of them are situated in a flattened local sheet @xcite with a typical density exceeding the global value . for the significant fraction of the local volume galaxies",
    ", the parameter o / h is available . only for two of them - leo",
    "a and ugca  292 , their values of o / h appear to be as low as 12+@xmath3(o / h ) @xmath27.3 .",
    "but both of them match the @xcite ` o / h vs @xmath60 ' relationship , so they just follow the general dependence .",
    "the volume of the lynx - cancer void relative to that of a large sphere with radius of 26  mpc , in which the lynx - cancer void is immersed , comprises only @xmath25% .",
    "there are at least four extremely metal - poor lsbds in the void ( including ddo  68 and sdss j0926 + 3343 at the mutual distance of only 1.6  mpc ) .",
    "we can count only one similar galaxy i  zw  18 for the large sphere .",
    "its real distance is still debated , but the analysis of its environment shows that i  zw  18 is also well isolated , having no luminous neighbours closer than 2  mpc .",
    "since no complete study of o / h in galaxies of the lv and the local supercluster exists , one can not exclude the role of some selection effects in this drastic enhancement of concentration of the ` extreme ' metal - poor lsbds in the lynx - cancer void .",
    "however , the overall effect of this `` selection '' does not look to be significant . nevertheless , the absence of more or less complete database for o / h in the lv galaxies is an important caveat for the comparative study of galaxy evolution in various environments .",
    "the increased density of such unusual objects in the void region is certainly not by chance .",
    "the most metal - poor galaxies prefer the low galaxy - density regions .",
    "however , even in voids their fraction is small",
    ". the void environment can be favourable for the retarded dwarf galaxy formation and their slower evolution due to significantly reduced effect of galaxy encounters and their induced sf .",
    "thus the ` inchoate ' galaxies could be a significant fraction of void population .",
    "on the other hand , the large fraction of currently detected ` extreme ' void dwarfs appear to experience a recent stronger or weaker interaction resulted in the extra sf and the enhanced intensities of emission lines .",
    "this eased their discovery , determining their optical redshifts and their identification as the void galaxies .",
    "how large a fraction of the dormant gas - rich galaxies is undisclosed in the void , remains an open question .",
    "the well - known interacting / merging pair of the most metal - poor dwarf galaxies sbs  0335052e , w ( see new data in * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is also situated near the border of a large void @xcite .",
    "the existence of the sizable hi  cloud population in ` nearby ' voids , with the baryonic masses comparable to those of dwarf galaxies , visible through their ly-@xmath43 absorption ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , also hints on the unevolved state of the significant fraction of baryons in voids .",
    "the more advanced analysis of the lynx - cancer void dwarf galaxy census and the summary of their properties will be presented elsewhere .",
    "summarising the results and discussion above , we draw the following conclusions :    1 .",
    "three lsb dwarf galaxies sdss j0723 + 3621 , j0737 + 4724 and j0852 + 1350 ( @xmath144=24.14 , 23.66 , and 23.41  mag  arcsec@xmath16 , respectively ) situated in the nearby lynx - cancer void appear to be the new representatives of very metal - poor and/or gas - rich void objects .",
    "the oxygen abundances of j0737 + 4724 and j0852 + 1350 , estimated via the semi - empirical method , correspond to 12+@xmath3(o / h)=@xmath27.24 and 7.28 dex , respectively .",
    "all three new void lsbds ( and three other similar void objects ) are dm dominated , with the estimated mass ratios of m@xmath130/m@xmath1453.4 , @xmath29 and @xmath28.8 , respectively .",
    "the values of this parameter for four lsbds with @xmath1461832  km  s@xmath6  are roughly consistent with those predicted in the model of @xcite with the suppressed gas accretion to small dm halos due to the uv - heating . on the other hand , the baryonic mass of the same four void lsbds appears too large in respect of extrapolated theoretical btf relation from @xcite , which well describes the ` common ' sdss galaxies .",
    "these two findings do not match each other .",
    "this issue certainly needs a deeper analysis and comparison with the most updated simulations .",
    "3 .   in the close surroundings",
    "( @xmath21213 kpc in projection ) of the two studied void lsbds j0723 + 3621 and j0852 + 1350 , we found the faint blue lsbds sdss j0723 + 3622 and j0852 + 1351 , with @xmath144=24.36 and 23.18  mag  arcsec@xmath16 .",
    "their relative velocities are + 89  km  s@xmath6  and + 30  km  s@xmath6 , respectively",
    ". the parameters of encounters for the two systems correspond to a prograde and a polar collision , respectively .",
    "the hi  data indicate significant gas exchange in the former pair .",
    "the @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 colours in the outer regions of three of the five studied void galaxies derived from the photometry of their sdss images , appear rather typical of other galaxies .",
    "they correspond to the pegase2 model track for the evolving stellar population with the continuous sf for ages of @xmath9513 gyr ( both salpeter of kroupa imf ) . for j0737 + 4724 and",
    "the faint lsbd companion j0723 + 3622 , the colours of the outer regions appear bluer , corresponding to the same tracks , but for ages of @xmath212 gyr .",
    "the combination of parameters o / h , the gas mass - fraction and the colours of the outer parts of galaxies indicates the slower rate of chemical evolution for all these lsbds , and suggests a significant delay in the beginning of the main sf episode for galaxies j0723 + 3622 and j0737 + 4724 .",
    "the discovery of new extremely metal - poor and/or ` unevolved ' dwarf galaxies ( j0723 + 3622 , j0737 + 4724 , j0852 + 1350 ) significantly extends the list of several such objects previously known as representatives of the lynx - cancer void ( namely , ddo  68 , sdss  j0926 + 3343 , sdss  j0744 + 2508 , sao  0822 + 3545 , sdss  j0812 + 4836 ) .",
    "the very existence of such a numerous group gives an evidence for the significant concentration of unevolved objects within a relatively small cell of the nearby universe .",
    "the void occupies @xmath45  % of the volume of the sphere with r = 26 kpc , to which it belongs and contains almost all such known objects .",
    "this supports the idea on the specific role of voids in providing the most suitable conditions for the survival of unevolved galaxies on the cosmological timescale .",
