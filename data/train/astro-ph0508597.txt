    "extragalactic observations with the _ einstein _ space x - ray telescope revealed a new category of sources , currently known as ultra - luminous x - ray sources ( ulxs , fabbiano 1989 ) . in 1990 , surveys conducted with the _ rosat _ satellite were able to resolve many of these sources as distinct objects not associated with emission from galactic nuclei .",
    "up to half of the galaxies surveyed were found to contain off - nuclear ulxs @xcite . in analogy with",
    "x - ray sources observed in our own galaxy , many ulxs could be extragalactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) with stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) accretors ( e.g. , rappaport , podsiadlowski , & pfahl 2005 ) .",
    "however , in many cases their luminosities exceed the eddington limit for isotropic emission from an accreting stellar - mass bh .",
    "the lowest luminosity that commonly defines a ulx , l@xmath5 erg s@xmath1 , corresponds to an eddington black hole mass @xmath6  still within the bh mass range allowed by stellar evolution models .",
    "based on the x - ray survey conducted by @xcite , ulxs with l@xmath5 erg s@xmath1 are estimated to exist in @xmath7 of all galaxies @xcite .",
    "of the 87 x - ray ( 2 - 10 kev ) sources observed , 45 had l@xmath8 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "this corresponds to the eddington luminosity for the highest - mass black holes that can form through single - star collapse , @xmath9 for a metallicity of @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "we see that as much as half of this observed ulx population requires an alternative to the model of isotropic emission from a stellar - mass xrb .",
    "observations increasingly support the idea that some ulx sources may harbor intermediate - mass black holes ( imbhs , colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) . until recently",
    ", no evidence existed for bhs in the wide mass range between stellar - mass and supermassive bhs .",
    "many spectral and timing observations conducted with _",
    "chandra , asca , _ and _ xmm - newton _ have confirmed that ulxs are not associated with supernovae and are consistent with accreting binaries @xcite .",
    "additionally , ulx positions are strongly correlated with young , star - forming regions .",
    "examples include the nine ulxs found in the antennae @xcite and the highest - luminosity ulx yet observed , in m82 ( peak l@xmath11 erg s@xmath1 , corresponding to an imbh mass @xmath12 if l@xmath13 l@xmath14 ; kaaret et al .",
    "2001 ; matsumoto et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the young , dense clusters where ulxs are often observed are also likely sites for imbh formation @xcite .",
    "accretion disk spectra provide a further test for the presence of imbhs : higher - mass bhs are expected to have cooler accretion disks modeled as multi - color disks @xcite .",
    "some evidence for low - temperature disks was recently found using high - resolution _ xmm _ spectra of numerous ulxs , including those in ngc 1313 , ngc 4559 , ho ix , and the antennae @xcite . as @xcite note",
    ", the sources observed to have cool disks are also the ones with luminosities too high to be explained by xrbs , even if they are beamed xrbs .",
    "nevertheless , we note that x - ray spectral interpretation is subject to a number of model assumptions and may not be unique .",
    "anisotropic , or beamed , disk emission is another possible explanation for apparently super - eddington x - ray luminosities .",
    "the degree to which emission is beamed can be defined by the beaming fraction b @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the solid angle of emission .",
    "ulxs containing beamed stellar - mass xrbs could be a short phase of rapid mass transfer in the lifetime of ordinary xrbs , such as thermal - timescale mass transfer @xcite . as demonstrated by @xcite , by introducing mild beaming",
    ", the xrb falls within the stellar - mass bh range , assuming l@xmath17 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "however , about 5 - 10@xmath18 of the total ulx population is observed to have l@xmath19 erg s@xmath1 @xcite . at these luminosities , very massive bhs ( @xmath9 ) could fall below the eddington limit with b @xmath20 . to have the required mass ratio @xmath21 , where m@xmath22 is the bh mass",
    ", these bhs would require a very massive companion .",
    "more moderate - mass bhs would require more severe beaming fractions that are not easily justified .",
    "furthermore , in at least two instances observations seem to indicate isotropic x - ray emission .",
    "these include an isotropic nebula observed arond the ulx in ho ii @xcite and the discovery of quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) from the brightest ulx in m82 @xcite .",
    "transient behavior of a ulx source is an important test for the presence of an imbh @xcite .",
    "if the ulx is a beamed stellar - mass xrb in thermal - timescale mass transfer , it is expected to produce persistent emission at or above the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "a persistent imbh ulx similarly would require a sustained @xmath23 comparable to the eddington mass transfer rate : @xmath24 for the imbh masses we consider , this is in excess of 10@xmath25 yr@xmath1 , corresponding to l@xmath26 erg s@xmath1 .",
    "transient imbh ulx sources are more plausible , because they confine the most extreme rates of mass transfer to short outburst periods .",
    "admittedly our current physical understanding of transient behavior is not complete .",
    "nevertheless , it is generally accepted that an accreting binary becomes a transient when the mass transfer rate driven by the donor is lower than a certain critical value and a thermal disk instability develops . in what follows",
    "we adopt the critical mass transfer rate for transient behavior of an x - ray irradiated disk given by @xcite : @xmath27 for donor mass m@xmath28 and disk radius _",
    "c _ _ is assumed to be @xmath29 for most donors .",
    "it can also be shown that the critical @xmath23 for transience corresponds to a minimum black hole mass that depends on companion mass and orbital period @xcite .",
    "as @xcite have shown , this minimum bh mass is high for main sequence ( ms ) donor stars ( @xmath30 on average for a @xmath31 donor ) .",
    "red giant ( rg ) donors can more easily form transient systems with imbhs .",
    "one should note that , due to the minimum mass limit , a stellar - mass bh binary is unlikely to be transient , so any transient ulx observed is a strong imbh candidate .    in our simulations , we consider imbhs that have formed through `` runaway collisions '' of ms stars .",
    "this is a channel for imbh formation in which a series of rapid mergers occur as the cluster begins core collapse , causing growth of a central massive object that can collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that an imbh formed though runaway growth actually prevents core collapse and causes the core to reexpand @xcite . in the dense clusters we are considering",
    ", the timescale for imbh formation through runaway mergers is estimated to be @xmath32 myr @xcite .",
    "because the core collapse time , t@xmath33 , is expected to obey the relation t@xmath34t@xmath35 , where t@xmath35 is the initial core relaxation time , this constrains t@xmath36 to be @xmath37 myr @xcite .",
    "given that a plausible imbh formation method exists , the question most pertinent to understanding ulxs is whether an imbh , once formed , will gain close stellar companions that can sustain mass transfer at ulx x - ray luminosities .",
    "no prior studies have attempted to investigate numerically with both dynamics and binary evolution whether binary formation and mass transfer can occur with imbhs in a dense cluster core ( for an analytical exploration of tidal capture and its consequences , see hopman , portegies zwart , & alexander 2004 ) . here , we take the first step in studying imbh binary interactions as a ulx possibility , using detailed numerical simulations that combine dynamical interactions with full binary stellar evolution . in ",
    "2 we outline the details of our simulations . the results for our standard cluster model ( details below ) are presented in  3 .",
    "the variations of these results for other cluster models are described in  4 . in  5 ,",
    "we discuss our results , estimating a lower limit on the incidence of imbh mass transfer , and we outline our goals for future simulations .",
    "the goal of our simulations is to examine the ability of imbhs in young , dense stellar clusters to form and maintain close binary systems with companion stars .",
    "we employ a numerical code developed by ivanova et al .",
    "( 2005 , where a detailed description of the method can be found ) .",
    "this adopted hybrid code incorporates : ( i ) a stellar population synthesis code to evolve single stars and binary systems ( _ startrack _ ; belczynski , kalogera , & bulik 2002 ; belczynski et al .",
    "2005 to be submitted ) ; ( ii ) a semi - analytical prescription for 2- , 3- , and 4-body stellar collisions , disruptions , exchanges , and tidal captures based on previously derived cross sections ; and ( iii ) a numerical toolkit for direct n - body integration of 3- and 4-body systems ( _ fewbody _ ; fregeau et al .",
    "this combination provides us with a unique numerical tool that lends itself to the study of binary interactions in cluster cores . at the young cluster ages we consider ,",
    "large - scale cluster evolution has little effect , so certain simplifications can be made .",
    "we employ a `` fixed background '' model , which holds the core stellar number density n@xmath38 and velocity dispersion @xmath39 constant ( e.g. , hut , mcmillan , & romani 1992 ; di stefano & rappaport 1994 ; sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "1997a ; portegies zwart et al .",
    "1997b ; rasio et al .",
    "the cluster density profile is assigned by dividing the cluster into two regions : a dense core and an outer halo .",
    "this model is qualitatively based on mass segregation .",
    "note that the core is expected to expand on a very short timescale immediately after the imbh is formed , smoothing out the cusp and supporting the assumption of a constant density core @xcite .    in our models ,",
    "an imbh is added to the core at 1 myr , in accordance with estimated imbh formation times of 1 - 3 myr in clusters @xcite . to form an imbh through runaway collisions , the initial core relaxation time , @xmath40 ,",
    "must be @xmath41 myr @xcite .",
    "this time is given by : @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 is the three - dimensional velocity dispersion , n@xmath38 is the core number density , n is the total number of stars , @xmath44 is the average stellar mass , and @xmath45 , the coefficient in the coulomb logarithm @xmath46 , is assumed to be 0.01 ( cf .",

    "( parameters are described below ) , @xmath47 29 myr , in good agreement with the constraint for runaway collisions .",
    "we evolve the clusters to 100myr , as we consider only young clusters like those with which ulxs are most often associated .",
    "we can then neglect long - term contributions of the outer halo to cluster evolution and synthesize the entire stellar population of n = @xmath48 in the core .",
    "mass segregation within the core is incorporated through our choice of the initial mass function ( imf ) used for the stellar population in the core .",
    "an initial binary fraction of 100% is assumed , which provides the maximum possible concentration of binaries to interact with and become companions of the imbh .",
    "observations indicate that young clusters are expected to have very high binary fractions @xcite .",
    "this assumption is also consistent with the suggestion that cluster binary populations are depleted over time by interactions and stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "initial conditions for binary orbital parameters are assigned as outlined in  3.1 of @xcite , with slight modifications :    * the binary mass ratio @xmath49 is assigned a uniform distribution @xmath50 , where m@xmath22 and m@xmath51 are the binary primary and secondary , respectively . *",
    "a uniform logarithmic distribution is used for the binary period , p , ranging from @xmath52 d. * the thermal distribution is used for the binary eccentricities @xmath53 with probability density @xmath54 .",
    "* binary systems are rejected from the initial distribution if one of the binary components enters roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) at pericenter .",

    "the latter corresponds to a luminosity density @xmath60 pc@xmath59 for a cluster age @xmath61 yr . the total cluster mass is @xmath62 .",
    "we use 100 m@xmath4 as our standard imbh mass , but we explore a range of imbh masses from @xmath63 ( see  4.1 ) . note that each type of simulation must be repeated many times to obtain good statistics .",
    "we also consider two variations of our standard cluster model ( see table  [ cm ] ) : with models b we explore the effect of a flatter imf , and with models c we examine results for less dense clusters .",
    "detailed simulations of clusters that form an imbh just before core collapse have shown that rapid mass segregation preceding imbh formation creates a mass function flatter than kroupa s for stars @xmath64 ( grkan , freitag , & rasio 2004 ; freitag , grkan , & rasio 2005 ; freitag 2005 , personal communication ) .",
    "these results have prompted us to consider the effects of mass segregation on the formation of imbh binaries .",
    "we have also examined whether any brownian - like motion of the imbh would cause it to interact with stellar populations that have different properties than those typical of the compact cluster cores . assuming energy equipartition exists between the imbh and the cluster , the imbh in a constant - density core will experience radial oscillations of amplitude @xcite @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the core radius , m@xmath67 is the imbh mass , and m@xmath68 is the total mass of the rest of the cluster .",
    "for a 100 m@xmath4 imbh and total cluster mass @xmath69 , we obtain an oscillation amplitude that is safely small : @xmath70 .",
    "we do not normally allow binary formation through three - body interactions in any of our simulations , as the initial binary fraction is 100% , but we do test the effect of 3-body binary formation ( 3bbf ) on models a and b. the details of our treatment of 3bbf are given in @xcite .",
    "a large fraction of imbh binaries acquire at least one , and often a series of tertiary objects ; however , no population synthesis code currently exists that is capable of modeling full stellar evolution for triple systems . for triple systems that are considered stable after the detailed direct n - body modeling with _ fewbody _ ( see stability criterion in mardling & aarseth 2001 ) , we implement a `` breakage '' prescription that is physically self - consistent .",
    "the energy required to eject the outer star is obtained by shrinking the inner binary orbit .",
    "the outer star is released unless the inner binary merges during shrinkage ; in this case the inner system is allowed to merge and the outer companion is kept at its new , wider orbit to form the final binary system .",
    "the condition for merger is that the stars in the inner binary are in physical contact at pericenter or , in the case of an imbh binary , the secondary star enters the black hole s tidal radius @xmath71 we recognize that this artificial treatment can affect the evolution of imbh binaries , for example , by preventing eccentricity boosts via the kozai mechanism @xcite . for this reason we have undertaken a careful analysis of triple breaking and its effect on our results ( see  3.5 ) .",
    "it should also be noted that in some cases with a rg companion , release of the outer companion induces a common - envelope phase in the resulting binary .",
    "in what follows we present the results of our standard , 100 m@xmath4 imbh cluster simulations ( model a in table 1 ) in the context of the formation of imbh binaries that experience mass transfer and may become observable as ulxs . in ",

    "orbital separations of the dynamically - formed imbh binaries range widely from @xmath74 .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to the roche lobe radius of the imbh companion . on the other end ,",
    "the soft boundary for binaries is defined as the `` escape radius '' @xmath75 in the simulations , a star is treated as a companion if its orbital separation is less than @xmath76 , corresponding to the maximum orbital separation , @xmath77 .",

    "these high eccentricities tend to increase the occurrence of mass - transfer events in which the companion overflows its roche lobe at pericenter .",

    "we conclude that either persistent or transient imbh ulxs would be observable for only a tiny fraction ( @xmath100% ) of the cluster lifetime .",
    "it should be emphasized that the mass transfer time fractions we present are averaged over all simulations , and that individual simulations are given equal weight , but their results do vary over a wide range .",
    "the majority of our simulations have _ no _ imbh mass - transfer events at all ; it turns out that the _ median _ mass - transfer time fraction for each cluster model is always at or very near zero ( fig .  [ mtfrac ] ) . at the other extreme , imbhs in a few model a simulations",
    "acquire very stable mass - transferring companions and spend more than half of their total evolution time in mass transfer phases .",

    "we would like to note that for the majority of our simulations the predictions for the imbh binaries leading to mass transfer with x - ray luminosities in the ulx regime could be even lower than we report based on the average quantities and results .",
    "the significant number of triple systems that form and are artificially ( although physically self - consistently , i.e. , conserving energy ) disrupted in our simulations warrant a separate analysis of their possible effect on mass transfer .",

    "it should be noted that a small fraction ( @xmath133 ) of triple systems form when a tight binary is captured by the imbh ; in this case , the imbh is recorded as the outer , `` ejected '' companion and binary evolution is subsequently followed for only the two closely orbiting companions . the data from this small number of unusual disrupted triples are not included in our results and has a negligible effect on the overall imbh binary evolution .",

    "the imbh spends only a fraction of a percent of total simulation time with mass - transferring companions ( 0.53% ) .",
    "we conclude that clusters with our standard core number density , n@xmath142 pc@xmath59 , are much more likely to contain an accreting - imbh ulx .",

    "the imbh has a binary companion for a shorter time fraction ( 40% ) than in model a simulations ( table  [ lowic ] ) .",
    "a decrease is also seen in the mass transfer time fraction between the two models .",
    "this could possibly result from having more massive stars in the core , due to the flatter imf , that interact with and can disrupt imbh binaries .",
    "however , we caution again that the mass transfer time fraction for our standard model is dominated by a few outliers , so that the difference seen in model b may or may not be significant .    the time in which the model b clusters are observable as ulx sources is very short , as in model a clusters : a transient ulx forms for about 3.5% of total mass transfer time , and persistent mass transfer at ulx luminosities occurs for about 7% of mass transfer time .",

    "companions are a bit more massive in clusters with 3bbf ( fig .  [ it_mdist ] ) .",
    "the difference in the mass distributions is small , but a larger effect is seen in the mass transfer time fraction . the time the imbh spends with a mass - transferring companion decreases by more than half when 3bbf is included .",
    "this phenomenon is probably similar to that which causes the disparity in mass transfer time between model a & b clusters .    due to the 100% initial binary fraction",

    "we have undertaken the first detailed investigation of imbh interactions in young ( @xmath145myr ) , dense cluster cores , incorporating binary dynamics with full binary star evolution .",
    "specifically , we study the prevalence and characteristics of interacting binaries involving the central imbh , and we examine and can better understand their role as potential ulx sources .",

    "imbhs more massive than @xmath146m@xmath4 in model a clusters spend the majority ( @xmath147% ) of their evolution time with a binary companion . *",
    "mass - transferring imbh companions , though , are relatively rare ( @xmath148 of the imbh evolution time ) compared to the total time the imbh spends with a companion . *",
    "imbhs spend more time in mass transfer phases with ms companions than with post - ms companions .",
    "* a much larger number fraction of post - ms companions than ms companions undergo mass transfer . * in model a clusters ,",
    "imbh binaries are found to be persistent x - ray sources for about 90% of the total mass transfer time , but the x - ray luminosity reaches ulx values ( l@xmath149ergs@xmath1 ) for only @xmath802% of the mass - transfer time . for the rest of the mass - transfer time ( @xmath7910% ) ,",
    "imbh binaries are found to be transients , which have short duty cycles .",
    "given that the typical total mass - transfer time is @xmath148 of imbh evolution time , these results amount to a vanishingly small observable - ulx time fraction ( @xmath150 ) over the lifetime of the young clusters we consider .",
    "* higher - mass imbhs capture more companions throughout their evolution , making them more likely in a statistical sense to capture a companion that can overflow its roche lobe .",
    "* model a clusters with a @xmath151 imbh and cluster model c have very few mass - transferring imbh binaries . * in model b clusters",
    ", the imbh spends less time with a companion ( 40% of total time ) and less time in mass transfer ( @xmath150 of total time ) than in model a clusters .",
    "* for all cluster models and imbh masses explored here , the possible ulx time fraction of the cluster lifetime ( 100myr ) is found to be typically of @xmath152% or even smaller .",
    "we note that results presented by @xcite imply a higher incidence of possible ulx activity associated with ms companions to central imbhs ( typically with duration of @xmath153yr ) .",
    "however , these calculations are based on analytical estimates of the possible tidal capture rates for an imbh in a cluster of single ms stars and the subsequent _ isolated _ binary evolution once a ms companion is acquired .",
    "these binary evolution calculations are not integrated with any dynamical evolution ( analytically or numerically ) and , based on our results , we conclude that the assumption of isolated evolution is not realistic . given the substantial differences in calculation methods , however , it is not possible to make direct and quantitative comparisons between the study by @xcite and our study .",
    "we note that in our simulations we do allow for tidal captures ( for details of implementation see ivanova 2005 ) , but they turn out to be a negligible contributor to the rate at which imbhs acquire companions ( exchanges into binaries is by far the dominant process ) .",
    "last , we recognize triple systems as one possibly limiting factor in our simulations .",
    "since triples are artificially disrupted as they form , we examine the influence of triples in terms of their initial orbital parameters and their coincidence with mass transfer phases .",
    "we find that while a large number of triple systems form per simulation , and while about @xmath154 of all 100 - 200 m@xmath4 mass - transferring companions do coincide with triple system formation , only a small fraction of mass transfer phases are affected by triples with `` close '' orbits .",
    "furthermore , two opposing phenomena related to triple breaking may cause some uncertainties .",
    "mass transfer may be prevented when potential kozai evolution is artificially interrupted , or it may be artificially induced when release of the outer companion shrinks the inner binary .",
    "we find that both effects are relevant for only small , roughly equivalent fractions of triples , causing a negligible net impact on our mass transfer results .",
    "therefore , we conclude that our treatment of triples in the regime of imbh masses considered here does not influence our conclusions about the possibility of imbh ulx formation .",
    "however , given the higher occurrence of triples in our @xmath155m@xmath156 runs , the issues of multiples and cusp formation are most probably more important for more massive imbhs ( @xmath157m@xmath156 ) than those considered here .    for these more massive imbhs , a more physical treatement of multiple systems would in principle allow the remaining uncertainties regarding triples , multiples , and the ultimate formation of central cusps to be resolved .",
    "however , to examine ulx formation , treatment of the stellar evolution of multiple systems can not be ignored ( especially when it involves massive - star companions that lose mass in winds , experience core - collapse and can themselves disrupt orbits and alter dynamical evolution ) .",
    "simulations that incorporate all of these effects are simply not possible at present . instead , for our future explorations of the imbh - ulx connection in dense clusters , we plan to implement simulations that would represent an improvement over the ones presented here .",
    "such future calculations could differentiate between triple systems in which the inner binary may be disturbed and those in which the outer companion may be ignored . in the latter case , the third companion would be kept in the system and its dynamical evolution alone could be simulated , while full stellar evolution and dynamics are calculated for the inner binary .",
