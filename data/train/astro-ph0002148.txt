    "measurements of qso spectra show that the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is composed of highly inhomogeneous structures . ever since their identification by lynds ( 1971 ) and the pioneering survey of sargent  et al .",
    "( 1980 ) , these inhomogeneities have been described as discrete absorption systems , the ly@xmath0forest . with the view that the systems arise from individual intervening gas clouds , the ly@xmath0forest has been characterized using traditional absorption line statistics , most notably the line equivalent widths and , as the spectra improved in resolution and signal  to  noise ratio , the doppler widths and column densities through voigt profile line fitting to the features .    in the past few years",
    ", numerical simulations have successfully modelled many of the measured properties of the forest , showing that the absorption systems may arise as a consequence of cosmological structure formation ( cen  et al .",
    "1994 ; zhang , anninos & norman 1995 ; hernquist  et al .  1996",
    "; bond & wadsley 1997 ; zhang  et al .  1997 ; theuns , leonard & efstathiou 1998 ) .",
    "the simulations have shown , contrary to the picture in which the systems are isolated intergalactic gas clouds , that most of the systems originate in an interconnected web of sheets and filaments of gas and dark matter ( cen  et al .",
    "1994 ; bond & wadsley 1997 ; zhang  et al .",
    "alternative statistical methods were subsequently introduced for describing the forest using the more direct measurements of the induced light fluctuations .",
    "these include the 1-point distribution of the fluctuations ( miralda - escud  et al .",
    "1996 ; zhang  et al .",
    "1997 ) , and a quantity related to the 2-point distribution based on a weighted difference of the light fluctuations in neighbouring wavelength pixels ( miralda - escud  et al .  )",
    ". a direct estimate of the 2-point transmission correlation function was made by zuo & bond ( 1994 ) .",
    "while the newer methods for analysing the ly@xmath0forest avoid the identification of absorption lines and the fitting of voigt profiles , they are not necessarily fundamentally different in their description of the spectra .",
    "for instance , zhang  et al .  (",
    "1998 ) find that the distribution of optical depth per pixel in their simulation may be recovered by modelling the spectra entirely by discrete absorption lines with voigt profiles .",
    "rather the more direct methods circumvent a difficulty that has long plagued attempts to characterize the absorbers in terms of voigt profiles : the sensitivity of the resulting line statistics to noise and to the fitting procedure .",
    "absorption line fitting of necessity requires arbitrary decisions to be made regarding the setting of the continuum level , the deblending of features , and a decision on the acceptability of a fit .",
    "different observational groups report different distributions for the line parameters .",
    "most discrepant has been the inferred distribution of line widths .",
    "even with the highest quality data gathered to date using the keck hires , agreement is still lacking , with hu  et al .",
    "( 1995 ) finding a narrower doppler parameter distribution with a significantly higher mean than found by kirkman & tytler ( 1997 ) .",
    "the differences are important , as cosmological simulations predict comparable differences for a range of plausible cosmological models ( machacek  et al .",
    "2000 ; meiksin  et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the purpose in this paper is to develop a method that provides an alternative objective description of the statistics of the ly@xmath0forest .",
    "ultimately the goal is to employ the same method for analysing both observational data and data derived from numerical simulations in order to compare the two on a fair basis . because of the large number of synthetic spectra generated from a simulation necessary to provide a correct average description of the forest , two principal requirements of the procedure are that it be fast and easily automated . although automated or semi  automated voigt profile fitting procedures exist ( autovp , dav  et al .",
    "1997 ; vpfit , developed by carswell and collaborators ) , these procedures still require arbitrary decisions to be made to obtain acceptable fits .",
    "the complexity of the codes makes it difficult to assess the statistical significance of differences between the measured distributions of the absorption line parameters and those predicted .",
    "the codes also are computationally expensive , making very costly their application to the large number of simulated spectra required to obtain a statistically valid average of the line parameters .",
    "for these reasons , a faster less complex method would be desirable .",
    "the voigt profile fitting codes yield important parameters , like the linewidths , which contain physical information ( eg , gas temperature and turbulent velocities ) , that the direct - analysis methods do not",
    ". it would thus be desirable for an alternative method to retain some of this information .",
    "the method presented here utilizes wavelets to characterize the absorption statistics of the ly@xmath0forest .",
    "it is not intended to be a replacement for voigt profile fitting , but a fast alternative that allows a ready comparison between the predictions of numerical models and measured spectra and a clear statistical analysis of the results .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ sec : wavelets ] it is shown how the statistics of the ly@xmath0forest may be characterized using wavelets . in ",
    "[ sec : results ] the method is applied to the measured spectrum of a high redshift qso .",
