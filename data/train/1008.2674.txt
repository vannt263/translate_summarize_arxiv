    "the discovery of unusual optical transients is a goal of modern surveys .",
    "focused supernova searches ( e.g. the texas supernova search ) or all - sky surveys , such as the panoramic survey telescope @xmath3 rapid response system ( pan - starrs ) , the catalina real - time transient survey ( crts ) , the palomar transient factory ( ptf ) and skymapper are expected to discover a large number of new types of stellar explosions in the next years .",
    "the preliminary results are remarkable , and newly discovered transients are revolutionizing our knowledge of stellar explosions .",
    "ultra - bright supernovae ( sne ) associated with faint and , presumably , metal - poor host galaxies are the most spectacular recent discoveries @xcite .",
    "the field has moved quickly , prompted by the unusual transient , discovered in the hubble space telescope cluster supernova survey @xcite .",
    "its lightcurve was symmetric , with a @xmath4100d rise time in the observed frame .",
    "the spectrum showed broad absorption features and the transient was associated with no obvious host galaxy ( although a weak source , 1.5  from the transient , was marginally detected at magnitude @xmath5@xmath425.8 ) . without robust constraints on the absolute magnitude for this transient ,",
    "even the discrimination between galactic and extra - galactic origin was uncertain .",
    "possible scenarios proposed by @xcite for were an outburst of a galactic c - rich white dwarf ( wd ) , a broad absorption lines quasar or a micro - lensing event , but none of them was fully convincing . assuming that the broad features in the spectra of were the c@xmath6 swan bands , @xcite tentatively fixed the redshift at z=0.14 , implying an absolute peak magnitude of about -18 , suggesting a sn - like explosion of a c - rich wolf - rayet ( wr ) star . a tidal disruption of a c - rich star by a black hole @xcite , a galactic wd - asteroid merger and a type ia sn in a dense , c - rich wind produced by a companion star @xcite were also proposed as alternative explanations .",
    "a few events have recently been discovered sharing observed properties with .",
    "data for a total sample of 6 objects have been presented by @xcite .",
    "one of them was , an enigmatic object originally presented in @xcite and classified as a peculiar , over - luminous sn iil . through the detection of narrow interstellar mg ii lines ,",
    "@xcite have definitely proved that these transients are not located in the galaxy or in the local group , but are relatively distant objects , with redshifts between 0.26 and 1.19 .",
    "consequently , they are extremely luminous , with @xmath7-band absolute magnitudes spanning between -22 and -23 . on the basis of the lack of any evidence of a slope consistent with @xmath2co decay in the late - time lightcurve of both and , @xcite favored either a pulsational pair - instability outburst scenario , or core - collapse sne powered by rapidly rotating young magnetars .",
    "unfortunately , follow - up observations collected so far for these transients and the information available for properly studying and modeling their data have been incomplete .",
    "the discovery of a relatively nearby object of this class caught early and followed in detail , has provided us with a new opportunity to study the energy output and spectral evolution of one of nature s brightest explosions .",
    "the crts team @xcite first announced the discovery of an optical transient at ra=11:25:46.71 and dec=-08:49:41.4 , on images obtained on march 13 , 2010 ( magnitude 18.5 , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "its optical spectrum showed a blue , featureless continuum , and the initial redshift determination ( z=0.17 ) was later corrected by the same authors to z=0.23 @xcite .    on",
    "the following day @xcite reported the independent discovery by the ptf survey @xcite of the same variable source ( labeled as ) at several epochs between march 5 and 16 , whilst no object was seen on march 4.27 ut to a limiting magnitude of 20.4 .",
    "optical spectra on march 18.27 ut showed that was a luminous sn similar to the ultra - bright @xcite .",
    "the spectrum showed broad features attributed to o ii @xcite .",
    "the presence of narrow lines attributed to a host galaxy allowed them to estimate the redshift to z=0.23 .",
    "in the course of the pan - starrs1 telescope ( ps1 ) 3@xmath8 survey , we recovered the transient ( , hereafter sn 2010gx ) between march 12 and 17 showing that its luminosity was still rising @xcite .",
    "@xcite noted the presence of a faint host galaxy in archive sdss images ( ) with magnitudes @xmath9=22.7 , @xmath10=0.3 , and confirmed the @xcite redshift estimate of z=0.23 . at this redshift ,",
    "the @xmath9-band absolute magnitude of the host galaxy is about -18 , similar to that of the lmc .",
    "we carried out an extensive @xmath11 photometric follow - up campaign of using the telescopes listed in table [ tab1 ] .",
    "the observed lightcurves , calibrated using 10 sdss stars in the field of the transient , are shown in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "the transient was discovered in the rising phase , and its lightcurves are asymmetric .",
    "the pre - discovery limit of march 4 @xcite indicates that experienced a fast rise to maximum , followed by a slower magnitude decline .",
    "a similar asymmetry was also observed in the lightcurve of @xcite .",
    "the photometric evolution of is somewhat different from the bell - like shape observed in the slow - evolving lightcurve of @xcite .",
    "assuming negligible host galaxy reddening ( galactic reddening of @xmath12=0.04 mag , * ? ? ?",

    ". however , appears to be 2.5 - 5 mag brighter than sne ib / c reported in figure [ fig2 ] , and its overall evolution is much slower than that of normal ib / c events , although faster than that experienced by .",
    "a major difference between the lightcurves of sne ib / c and is the _ apparent _ lack of a radioactive tail , in analogy to that observed in the case of other objects of the quimby et al . sample .",
    "however , with the data collected so far , we can not exclude the possibility that the lightcurve flattens onto a radioactive tail at later epochs . in that case",
    ", the expected amount of @xmath2ni ejected by would be comparable ( or only marginally higher , e.g. @xmath181m@xmath19 ) to that of type ib / c sne .",
    "a sequence of spectra of was obtained with the 2.56-m nordic optical telescope and the 4.2-m william herschel telescope ( la palma , canary islands ) , and the 8.1-m gemini south telescope ( cerro pachn , chile ) .",
    "pre - maximum spectra obtained on march 21 and 22 show a very blue continuum ( with a blackbody temperature @xmath20 k ) with broad absorption features below @xmath45700   ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "weak , narrow emission lines ( h@xmath21 , h@xmath22 and the [ o ii ] doublet at 4959,5007 ) of the host galaxy are also visible , confirming the identification of the broad features as o ii , also identified by @xcite in the spectra of ( figure [ fig4 ] , top ) .",
    "a spectrum obtained on april 1 ( + 4d ) is still blue ( t@xmath23 k ) but is almost featureless .",
    "a significant evolution of the spectra of then occurred at 10 - 20d after peak . at these epochs",
    "the spectra show very broad p - cygni absorptions of ca ii , fe ii and si ii , very similar to those observed in spectra of young sne ic @xcite .",
    "the subsequent spectrum , obtained on may 2 ( + 30d ) , is markedly more similar to those of sne ic soon after maximum light .",
    "finally , a further spectrum was obtained on jun 5 ( + 57d ) , and showed only a mild evolution in the spectral features .",
    "the spectral evolution of from an -like event to a type ic sn provides an unexpected clue for understanding the evolutionary path of this class of transients . in order to produce o ii features ( together with the si iii ,",
    "c ii and mg ii lines observed in spectra of other objects of this family , see * ? ? ?",
    "* and figure [ fig4 ] , top ) , high photospheric temperatures are necessary .",
    "interestingly , @xcite noted a short - life `` w '' feature in a very early spectrum of the type ib . that feature , visible in a spectrum taken 1.84d after the x - ray flash associated with the sn , disappeared 1d later .",
    "@xcite noted striking similarity with the early - time spectrum of and ( following * ? ? ?",
    "* ) tentatively identified such short - life features as a combination of o iii , n iii and c iii lines .",
    "however , the `` w '' feature in is slightly blueshifted compared to the analogous feature visible in the early spectra of and .",
    "therefore , fleeting lines due to ionized intermediate - mass elements could be common in very early spectra of some type ib / c sne",
    ". however , these lines are visible for several weeks after the explosion in -like objects , which is likely due to higher densities and temperatures of the ejecta which persist for longer than in canonical sne ib / c .",
    "as the sn expands , the ejecta become cooler and other broad lines appear ( ca ii , mg ii , fe ii and si ii ) .",
    "these features are commonly visible in ib / c spectra around maximum @xcite . in figure [ fig4 ] ( middle ) , a later spectrum of ( + 21d ) is compared with a pre - maximum spectrum of the normal type ic sn 1994i @xcite and a slightly post - maximum spectrum of the broad - line ic sn 2003jd @xcite . the striking similarity among these",
    "3 spectra is a confirmation that ( and possibly all -like objects ) should be considered spectroscopically as sne ic , although with rather extreme photometric properties ( section [ ph ] ) .",
    "the similarity with normal stripped - envelope sne is even more evident in the comparison of the last spectrum of ( june 5 ) with spectra of the type ic @xcite and @xcite obtained about 1 week after their @xmath16-band peaks .",
    "provides important clues to understand the nature of ultra - bright events .",
    "its spectro - photometric similarities with this family is well established : high luminosity , slow - evolving lightcurves , similar spectral properties and faint host galaxies .",
    "the spectral evolution of now links this family of transients to the more common type ib / c sne , and by implication the progenitor stars .",
    "the overall spectral evolution is indeed similar to that of sne ib / c , although spectroscopically evolved on a much longer timescale .",
    "the observed parameters of present several problems in interpreting the explosion .",
    "its impressive luminosity at maximum and slower evolution could simply be interpreted as implying large photospheric radii ( @xmath24 ) and large ejecta masses ( @xmath25 ; for radiative diffusion from a sphere ) .",
    "the energy source for sne ib / c is the decay of radioactive isotopes , but the 80d - long post - peak decline of ( fig .",
    "2 ) is too steep to be due to @xmath2co decay .",
    "it is plausible that a radioactive tail could be detected at later phases , if the lightcurve flattens to the luminosity of the type ic sn 1998bw . but",
    "this would imply @xmath181m@xmath19 of @xmath2co decaying into @xmath2fe to power the tail luminosity , and such a moderate mass of @xmath2ni can not account for the high bolometric luminosity at peak , which is @xmath43 - 4@xmath2610@xmath27 erg s@xmath28 . assuming that the bolometric luminosity from the earliest ptf detection to our earliest multi - band observation was constant , the energy radiated by during the first 100d is @xmath46@xmath2610@xmath29 erg .",
    "the peak luminosity of sn 2010gx is quite similar to that of sn 2007bi , but the lightcurve and spectral evolution are completely different @xcite . the slow decay time , and appearance of strong [ feii ] lines in sn 2007bi suggested a kinetic energy of few @xmath2610@xmath30 erg , very massive ejecta and 3 - 6m@xmath19 of @xmath2ni synthesized .",
    "@xcite postulated this was the explosion of a 100m@xmath19 core in a pair - instability sn . while this possibility was also noted by @xcite , the gravitational collapse of the c+o core of a massive star ( m@xmath31 = 50 - 100m@xmath19 ) is a viable mechanism ( as recently calculated by * ? ? ?",
    "whatever the explosion scenario , a large amount of @xmath2ni is necessary .",
    "however , sn 2010gx is markedly different in its properties , particularly the more rapid decay in its lightcurve indicates that the pair - instability scenario and a large @xmath2ni production are unlikely to be the explanation .    the apparent lack of any evidence of lightcurve flattening to a radioactive tail led @xcite to favor the _ pulsational _ pair - instability eruption scenario over a genuine sn explosion for sn 2005ap , scp-06f6 and other ptf sne . in the pulsational pair - instability model ,",
    "the luminosity is generated by the collision of shells of material material ejected at different times by the pulsations .",
    "little or no @xmath2ni powers the lightcurve for long periods .",
    "the outbursts are expected to be energetic , reaching very high peak luminosities and creating hot ( t@xmath3225000k ) , optically thick photospheres @xcite .",
    "all of this is consistent with the parameters observed in ultra - bright sne , and our well sampled lightcurve of sn 2010gx is not too different from those calculated by @xcite .",
    "however , these models are for supergiant progenitors with large , extended h - rich envelopes .",
    "the energy released in the pulsations is predicted to be 0.005 - 2@xmath2610@xmath29erg , in most cases below @xmath33erg .",
    "this is enough to eject the loosely bound envelope of an extended supergiant , but weather or not this mechanism could eject a substantial part of a more compact wr star @xcite remains to be calculated in detail .",
    "additionally , we do not see any sign of interaction between dense gas shells in the form of narrow circumstellar lines . while the pulsational pair - instability model is appealing as it can produce the high luminosity",
    ", it needs further consideration to determine if it is physically viable for h - free progenitor stars .",
    "another possibility , also discussed in @xcite , is that ultra - bright sne are powered by the spin down of newly born magnetars @xcite .",
    "a magnetar with a moderate magnetic field ( b@xmath1510@xmath34 gauss ) and spinning periods of 2 - 20ms can produce peak luminosities similar to that observed in sn 2010gx ( @xmath43 - 4@xmath2610@xmath27 erg s@xmath28 ) .",
    "in addition , magnetar - powered sn models do not need large @xmath2ni and total ejected masses @xcite , and can show ic sn features @xcite .",
    "however our extensive lightcurve coverage of sn 2010gx shows a faster decline than the model lightcurves , and our estimated photospheric temperatures are a factor 2 - 4 higher than model predictions .    the observational evidence presented in this paper links ( and probably the entire family of transients described by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with sne ic .",
    "the very luminous and broad lightcurve implies much larger ejecta masses than inferred even for the broad - lined sne ic ( @xmath48 - 15m@xmath35 , * ? ? ?",
    "the close similarity in the spectra implies the progenitor was a massive wr star , but the energy source powering the remarkable luminosity is uncertain .",
    "in fact we have a sn - like transient which does not comfortably match any of the known sn scenarios , i.e. core - collapse and @xmath2ni - powered explosion , pair - instability , pulsational pair - instability nor magnetar - powered event .",
    "the key diagnostics in the future will be late - time photometric monitoring after solar conjunction , and very early detection of new events .",
    "the presence of a late - time lightcurve tail with a slope roughly consistent with the @xmath2co decay could support a real sn explosion , and the early rise - time can help to determine the progenitor radius and possibly signs of interaction between colliding shells .",
    "the recent suggestion that the most massive stars in the lmc may be up to 320m@xmath35  @xcite could lead to more diverse sn progenitor populations than is currently appreciated @xcite .",

    "<S> recent searches by unbiased , wide - field surveys have uncovered a group of extremely luminous optical transients . </S>",
    "<S> the initial discoveries of sn 2005ap by the texas supernova search and scp-06f6 in a deep hubble pencil beam survey were followed by the palomar transient factory confirmation of host redshifts for other similar transients . </S>",
    "<S> the transients share the common properties of high optical luminosities ( peak magnitudes @xmath0 to @xmath1 ) , blue colors , and a lack of h or he spectral features . </S>",
    "<S> the physical mechanism that produces the luminosity is uncertain , with suggestions ranging from jet - driven explosion to pulsational pair - instability . </S>",
    "<S> here we report the most detailed photometric and spectral coverage of an ultra - bright transient ( sn 2010gx ) detected in the pan - starrs1 sky survey . in common with other transients in this family , </S>",
    "<S> early - time spectra show a blue continuum , and prominent broad absorption lines of o ii . </S>",
    "<S> however , about 25d after discovery , the spectra developed type ic supernova features , showing the characteristic broad fe ii and si ii absorption lines . </S>",
    "<S> detailed , post - maximum follow - up may show that all sn 2005ap and scp-06f6 type transients are linked to supernovae ic . </S>",
    "<S> this poses problems in understanding the physics of the explosions : there is no indication from late - time photometry that the luminosity is powered by @xmath2ni , the broad lightcurves suggest very large ejected masses , and the slow spectral evolution is quite different from typical ic timescales . </S>",
    "<S> the nature of the progenitor stars and the origin of the luminosity are intriguing and open questions . </S>"
