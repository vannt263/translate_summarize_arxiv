    "the first examples in dimension @xmath6 were found by schiemann @xcite , and later by earnest and nipp @xcite .",
    "these results were generalized by conway and sloane @xcite , who constructed sets of isospectral pairs of flat tori in @xmath7 , and these sets depend continuously on several parameters .",
    "the existence of such a large variety of isospectral pairs , suggests naturally the question - what is the additional information necessary to resolve the isospectrality .",

    "we are interested in the spectrum of the laplace beltrami operator @xmath18 with eigenfunctions which are uniquely defined on @xmath19 .",

    "the study of the spectrum ( i.e. those integers that can be represented by a given integer quadratic form ) and the degeneracies ( the number of representations ) is a subject which was studied at length in number theory . here",
