    "hydrogen is an interesting system for the study of beyond - the - sm effects because it is well - understood theoretically,@xcite high - precision experiments are available , and it is amenable to the calculation of hypothetical new effects using standard methods .",
    "the leading sme corrections  at @xmath2 times sme parameters  to the hydrogen energies have been known for some time.@xcite we have obtained the next order of corrections  at @xmath3 times",
    "sme parameters.@xcite there were several reasons for pursuing this calculation .",
    "one is that the lowest order sme correction depends on only a few combinations of sme coefficients .",
    "perhaps those combinations are zero or small and the leading order effect occurs at higher order . certainly we did find that the higher order result has more structure than the lowest order one in terms of dependence on sme parameters and on the quantum numbers .",
    "in addition , such a calculation is useful for learning more about the theory .",
    "it is difficult to anticipate what issues or problems might arise in a higher order calculation without actually doing the calculation .",
    "hydrogen is appropriate for the exploration of such issues due to its simplicity .",
    "we also explored the possibility of placing new constraints on the sme coefficients through use of the higher - order results .",
    "there were three main parts in our calculation .",
    "first , we needed to find an effective hamiltonian to describe the interaction between the constituent fermions in hydrogen with the background sme vectors and tensors .",
    "next , we needed to evaluate the energy shifts due to the new interactions in appropriate states of the hydrogen atom .",
    "finally , we needed to calculate the energy shifts coming from sme modifications to the electromagnetic binding potential .",
    "we address these three parts in turn .",
    "we work in the context of standard quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) extended by the minimal sme .",
    "the appropriate lagrangian has the form @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the covariant derivative , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 contain the sme coefficients @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc . :",
    "@xmath12    the effective fermion hamiltonian arising from the sme can be written as an expansion in the fermion momentum since the characteristic scale of momentum in a non - relativistic coulombic bound state is @xmath13 .",
    "we will need the expansion up to terms of order @xmath14 . to that order",
    ", the effective hamiltonian can be obtained by a simple non - relativistic expansion of the expectation value of the self - energy operator @xmath15 : @xmath16 where @xmath17 comes from the part of @xmath18 that is bilinear in fermions .",
    "we use the dirac representation for gamma matrices and the non - relativistic spinor normalization @xmath19 where @xmath20 .",
    "it is a simple matter now to expand the matrix elements of various dirac matrices .",
    "we find , for example , @xmath21 .",
    "we use the non - covariant normalization @xmath22 so that @xmath23 has the usual non - relativistic normalization . for the sme contribution to the effective hamiltonian",
    "we find @xmath24 where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 with @xmath29 .",
    "we do not show the @xmath30 and @xmath31 coefficients because they do not contribute to the final result .",
    "the masses and coefficients here are those appropriate to the electron .",
    "there is a similar contribution to @xmath32 coming from the proton , but its @xmath33 contribution is suppressed by a relative factor of the square of the electron to proton mass ratio and is not shown here",
    ". this effective hamiltonian agrees with that found earlier using the foldy - wouthuysen transformation.@xcite    having obtained the required effective hamiltonian , we are in a position to calculate sme - induced corrections to hydrogen energy levels .",
    "we couple angular momenta in the usual way : orbital to electron spin first ( @xmath34 ) , then to proton spin ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "states are labeled by quantum numbers @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 : @xmath41 . in the presence of the usual perturbations giving rise to fine structure , the lamb shift , hyperfine splitting , and zeeman splitting ( in the presence of any magnetic field ) , these states are non - degenerate .",
    "we use standard non - degenerate perturbation theory to calculate the effect of @xmath32 .",
    "the correction at @xmath42 is given by @xmath43 ( we are including electron effects only ) .",
    "the expectation value of the electron spin matrix is conveniently worked out by use of the wigner - ekhart theorem , leading to @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the reduced matrix element @xmath46 .",
    "( the proton effect is just as easy to calculate but we do not show it here . )",
    "this contribution was first obtained by bluhm _",
    "et al._@xcite      at @xmath33 we need the expectation values of @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "we found it useful to factor the radial and angular parts : @xmath51 and use the fact that the wave functions factorize into radial and angular parts as well .",
    "the radial expectation value was done by way of the virial theorem : @xmath52 .",
    "the angular evaluation was facilitated by the separation of @xmath53 into parts having @xmath54 and @xmath55 : @xmath56 .",
    "after a lengthy exercise in angular momentum algebra we obtained our final result for the electron part of the energy correction at this order : @xmath57 where @xmath58 , @xmath59 with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "another energy correction at @xmath33 comes from the photon sector .",
    "the photon propagator is corrected by sme interactions , which lead to corrections to the potential energy between the electron and proton .",
    "for example , the correction to the potential involving @xmath62 was found by bailey and kosteleck:@xcite @xmath63 .",
    "the corresponding energy correction is @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "an interesting application of our result is to the 2s-1s transition in hydrogen , which has been measured to extreme precision.@xcite the sme correction to this energy splitting due to both electron and photon effects is @xmath67 this correction and , of course , experimental input , has been used to set a bound on the diagonal spatial components of the sme tensor @xmath68.@xcite"
