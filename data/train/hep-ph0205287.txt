    "the flavor - changing neutral current transitions @xmath4 and @xmath5 with @xmath6 are of special interest because they proceed at the loop level in the standard model ( sm ) involving also the top quark .",

    "the available experimental measurements of the branching ratio of the inclusive radiative @xmath9-meson decay @xmath10 are consistent with the next - to - leading order prediction of the standard model ( see , e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) : @xmath11 the decay @xmath12 @xmath13 has been observed by the belle collaboration @xcite with a branching ratio of @xmath14 the recent observation of the bottom - charm @xmath15 meson by the cdf collaboration at tevatron in fermilab @xcite raises hopes that one may also explore the rare decays of the bottom - charm meson in the future .    the theoretical study of the exclusive rare decays proceeds in two steps .",
    "first , the effective hamiltonian for such transitions is derived by calculating the leading and next - to - leading loop diagrams in the sm and by using the operator product expansion and renormalization group techniques .",
    "the modern status of this part of the calculation is described in the review @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "second , one needs to evaluate the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian between hadronic states .",
    "this part of the calculation is model dependent since it involves nonperturbative qcd .",
    "there are many papers on this subject .",
    "the decay rates , dilepton invariant mass spectra and the forward - backforward asymmetry in the decays @xmath16 have been investigated in the sm and its supersymmetric extensions by using improved form factors from light - cone qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "an updated analysis of these decays has been done in @xcite by including explicit @xmath17 and @xmath18 corrections . the invariant dilepton mass spectrum and the dalitz plot for the decay @xmath12 have been studied in @xcite by using quark model form factors .",
    "the @xmath12 decay form factors were studied via qcd sum rules in @xcite and within the lattice - constrained dispersion quark model in @xcite .",
    "various aspects of these decays were discussed in numerous papers by aliev _",
    "et al . _",
    "the exclusive semileptonic rare decays @xmath12 were analyzed in supersymmetric theories in  @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution and cp asymmetries in the decays @xmath19 were investigated in  @xcite .",
    "the lepton polarization for the inclusive decay @xmath20 was discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "the rare decays of @xmath21 were studied in  @xcite by using the form factors evaluated in the light front and constituent quark models .    in this paper",
    "we study the exclusive rare decays @xmath0 .",
    "we employ a relativistic quark model @xcite to calculate the decay form factors .",
    "this model is based on an effective lagrangian which describes the coupling of hadrons @xmath22 to their constituent quarks .",
    "the coupling strength is determined by the compositeness condition @xmath23 @xcite where @xmath24 is the wave function renormalization constant of the hadron @xmath22 .",
    "one starts with an effective lagrangian written down in terms of quark and hadron fields .",
    "then , by using feynman rules , the s - matrix elements describing the hadronic interactions are given in terms of a set of quark diagrams .",
    "in particular , the compositeness condition enables one to avoid a double counting of hadronic degrees of freedom .",
    "the approach is self - consistent and universally applicable .",
    "all calculations of physical observables are straightforward .",
    "the model has only a small set of adjustable parameters given by the values of the constituent quark masses and the scale parameters that define the size of the distribution of the constituent quarks inside a given hadron .",
    "the values of the fit parameters are within the window of expectations .",
    "the shape of the vertex functions and the quark propagators can in principle be found from an analysis of the bethe - salpeter and dyson - schwinger equations as was done e.g. in @xcite . in this paper , however , we choose a phenomenological approach where the vertex functions are modelled by a gaussian form , the size parameter of which is determined by a fit to the leptonic and radiative decays of the lowest lying charm and bottom mesons . for the quark propagators we use the local representation . in the present calculations we do not employ the so - called impulse approximation used previously @xcite .",
    "the numerical results obtained with and without the impulse approximation are close to each other for light - to - light and heavy - to - heavy transitions but differ considerably from one another for heavy - to - light transitions as e.g. in the @xmath25 transitions .",
    "we calculate the form factors of the transition @xmath26 and use them to evaluate differential decay rates and polarization observables .",
    "we give the @xmath1-dependence of a set of observables with and without long - distance contributions which include the lower - lying charmonium states according to @xcite .",
    "we extend our analysis to the exclusive rare decay @xmath27 .",
    "we derive a four - fold angular decay distribution for the cascade @xmath28 process in the helicity frame including lepton mass effects following the method outlined in  @xcite .",
    "the four - fold angular decay distribution allows one to define a number of physical observables which are amenable to measurement .",
    "we compare our results with the ones of other studies .",
    "we should remark that our approach is developed mainly for the hadrons ( mesons and baryons ) which satisfy to the so - called `` threshold inequality '' : the hadron mass should be smaller the sum of their constituents , i.e. the sum of the constituent quark masses . in this vein ,",
    "our model was successfully developed for the study of light hadrons ( e.g. , pion , kaon , baryon octet , @xmath29-resonance ) , heavy - light hadrons ( e.g. , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath9 and @xmath32-mesons , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36-baryons ) and double heavy hadrons ( e.g , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath15-mesons , @xmath39 and @xmath40 baryons )  @xcite . to extend our approach to other hadrons we had to introduce extra model parameters or do some approximations , like , e.g. , to introduce the cutoff parameter for external hadron momenta to guarantee the fulfilment of the mentioned above `` threshold inequality '' .",
    "therefore , at the present stage we can not apply our approach for the study of rare decays involving @xmath41 mesons .",

    "we derive the four - fold angular decay distribution for the cascade @xmath28 process in the helicity system and define a number of physical observables from the angular decay distribution .",
    "our analysis goes beyond the results on the four - fold decay distribution presented in @xcite in that we include lepton mass effects appropriated for the treatment of the channel with @xmath43-leptons in the final state .",
    "we also present results on the longitudinal polarization of the leptons in the @xmath44-cm frame .",

    "we plot the @xmath1-dependence of the differential decay rate and the longitudinal polarization of the leptons with and without long distance contributions .",
    "the starting point of the description of the rare exclusive decays is the effective hamiltonian obtained from the sm - diagrams by using the operator product expansion and renormalization group techniques .",
    "it allows one to separate the short - distance contributions and isolate them in the wilson coefficients which can be studied systematically within perturbative qcd .",
    "the long - distance contributions are contained in the matrix elements of local operators .",
    "contrary to the short - distance contributions the calculation of such matrix elements requires nonperturbative methods and is therefore model dependent .    we will follow refs.@xcite in writing down the analytical expressions for the effective hamiltonian and paper @xcite in using the numerical values of the input parameters characterizing the short - distance contributions . at the quark level",
