    "very wide binaries play a special role in astrophysics .",
    "low binding energies make them sensitive probes of galactic dynamical environment .",
    "the very existence of wide binaries can constrain properties of the dark matter ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the typical size of protostellar cores ( @xmath90.1pc ) is comparable to the separation of the widest binaries that survive against gravitational perturbations in the galaxy .",
    "most stars form in clusters , in which wide ( and even relatively closer ) binaries are susceptible to disruption ; the surviving wide pairs provide constraints on the dynamical environments and processes at the epoch of star formation @xcite . at larger scales of @xmath91pc",
    "we also encounter co - moving remnants of nearby clusters and associations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these groups of stars , related by common origin , can not be classified as physical systems ( binaries ) because as far as we know , they do not move on stable orbits around each other .",
    "the transition between _ binaries _ and _ co - moving stars _ is still an unsettled issue .",
    "@xcite found pairs with projected separations of few pc in the _ hipparcos _ catalog , many of which belong to known moving groups .",
    "@xcite argues that one multiple system with 1-pc separation ( member of the castor moving group ) could be `` hard '' enough to remain bound .",
    "yet another use of wide binaries is in the calibration of luminosities and abundances in the low - mass regime , referencing to their hotter well - studied primary components .",
    "parallaxes of the bright primaries from , e.g. , the hipparcos catalog can be assigned to the secondaries and provide accurate luminosity measurements @xcite .",
    "a well - characterized primary is particularly useful to calibrate the fundamental parameters of m dwarfs , whose complicated spectra dominated by molecular absorption bands still resist detailed atmospheric modeling .",
    "the metallicity scale of m dwarfs remains largely dependent on metallicity measurements of fgk primaries in common proper motion ( cpm ) pairs @xcite .",
    "it is thus important to assemble catalogs of common proper motion pairs where the primaries are well - characterised _ hipparcos _",
    "fgk dwarfs , and the secondaries are m dwarfs spanning a broad range of colors and luminosities .",
    "the main motivation of this study is to provide a reasonably complete census of very wide companions to nearby solar - type stars . combined with information on closer pairs also available for this sample , it will lead to the un - biased multiplicity statistics much needed as a benchmark for star - formation theories @xcite .",
    "the recent study by @xcite furnished such statistics for 454 stars within 25pc from the sun , but a much larger sample is needed to study triple and higher - order hierarchies because they comprise only @xmath910% of all objects .",
    "most solar - type exo - planet hosts are also beyond the 25pc horizon of previous multiplicity surveys .",
    "it is important to search for and identify wide companions to known exoplanet hosts , and companions to other nearby stars which are still being observed in search of exo - planets , in order to characterize planet populations in binary systems @xcite .",
    "primary targets for our search for cpm companions are all stars with parallax @xmath10mas selected from the _ hipparcos_-2 catalog ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter hip2 ) .",
    "the _ hipparcos _",
    "catalog is complete to 67pc for dwarfs of mid - g spectral type or brighter , thus providing a clean distance - limited sample for multiplicity statistics . at the same time , these nearby stars move fast enough to discriminate cpm companions against background stars and are close enough to detect intrinsically faint companions .",
    "little is to be gained by extending the distance limit further .",
    "existing data on cpm binaries is in large part based on the luyten visual searches for cpm binaries with @xmath11  yr@xmath1 ( lds , * ? ? ?",
    "a recent study has repeated the visual search , by blinking the digitized sky survey fields around exo - planet host stars @xcite and stars within 25pc @xcite . a more systematic search for companions to _ hipparcos _ stars was conducted by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter lb2007 ) , who used the lspm - north catalog of stars with proper motions @xmath12 yr@xmath1 @xcite ; the paper also gives a good overview of prior work .",
    "detecting cpm binaries in large databases was also demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , for systems with fainter primaries .    in this paper",
    ", we expand on the search performed by lb2007 , and use the full superblink all - sky proper motion catalog , which is an extension of the published lspm - north catalog .",
    "the method for selecting cpm companion candidates is presented in section  [ sec : cat ] .",
    "statistics of all companions are discussed in section  [ sec : comp ] .",
    "then we concentrate in section  [ sec : stat ] on the statistics of wide physical binaries , namely the distributions of projected separations and mass ratios .",
    "our conclusions and discussion of results are presented in section  [ sec : sum ] .",
    "the superblink survey is based on an automated search for moving sources from multi - epoch images of the digitized sky survey ( dss ) , notably scans from the first and second epoch palomar sky surveys ( poss - i , poss - ii ) .",
    "compared to lspm - north , the detection threshold in the full superblink catalog is significantly lower , @xmath13mas yr@xmath1 for stars north of declination @xmath14 , and extends the survey to a proper motion limit @xmath15mas yr@xmath1 for all declinations south of @xmath14 .",
    "the survey is still in progress ; more information can be found in the recent paper by @xcite .",
    "superblink is at least 90% complete down to visual magnitude @xmath16 , and has a very low level of false detections ( @xmath17 ) thanks to stringent quality controls including visual confirmation of all targets .",
    "the @xmath18 magnitudes of faint stars are estimated from the dss photographic photometry reported in @xcite , using the procedure described in @xcite .",
    "we select as possible primaries of cpm pairs all stars from hip2 with parallax greater than 15mas and proper motion larger than the superblink limit ( @xmath19mas yr@xmath1 for stars north of declination @xmath14 and @xmath20mas yr@xmath1 otherwise ) .",
    "potential cpm companions to these stars were selected from superblink by the following three criteria .",
    "1 .   separation of the companion @xmath21 should be in the interval @xmath22 .",
    "closer companions are affected by the oreols of primary stars in dss photographic images , introducing selection against faint companions .",
    "most pairs wider than @xmath23 ( projected separation 20kau at 67pc ) are chance alignments ( optical ) , but including them in the catalog helps us to evaluate the proportion of true ( physical ) wide binaries .",
    "proper motion difference with the primary component @xmath24 should be less than 25mas  yr@xmath1 .",
    "typical proper motion errors in superblink are 8mas  yr@xmath1 , so this cutoff allows for larger errors or some additional proper motion difference caused by motion in hierarchical sub - systems .",
    "3 .   color and magnitude of the secondary should be consistent with a main sequence star or a white dwarf at the same distance as the primary .",
    "this criterion effectively requires that the photometric distance of the secondary as estimated from ( @xmath18,@xmath25 ) be consistent with the parallax distance of the alleged _ hipparcos _ primary .",
    "the first two criteria identify 130882 possible pairings , the vast majority of which are simple chance alignments . for the third criterion",
    ", we first calculate the absolute magnitudes of the cpm companions ( @xmath26_{\\rm sec}$ ] ) assuming that the secondary is at the same distance as the _ hipparcos _ primary : @xmath27_{\\rm sec } = v_{\\rm sec } + 5 \\log ( \\pi_{\\rm pri } ) + 5 , \\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the _ hipparcos _ parallax of the primary .",
    "we then use the ( @xmath29,@xmath25 ) color magnitude relationship as calibrated in @xcite for main sequence ( ms ) stars in the superblink survey .",
    "these define photometric absolute magnitudes @xmath26_{\\rm ms}$ ] estimated from @xmath25 : @xmath27_{\\rm ms } = 0.08 + 3.89 ( v - j ) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ v - j <",

    "\\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ 5.0 < v - j < 9.0 ] .",
    "\\label{eq : mv - vj}\\ ] ] in addition , we introduce the following simple color - magnitude relationship which we use to define absolute magnitudes for white dwarfs ( wd ) based on @xmath25 : @xmath27_{\\rm wd } = 12.5 + 3.75 ( v - j ) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ -1 < v - j < 0]\\ ] ] @xmath27_{\\rm wd } = 12.5 + 1.89 ( v - j ) \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ [ 0 < v - j < 3 ] .",
    "\\label{eq : wd}\\ ] ] we then select only pairs whose @xmath26_{\\rm sec}$ ] agree to within 1.5 magnitudes of either photometrically estimated absolute magnitudes @xmath26_{\\rm ms}$ ] or @xmath26_{\\rm wd}$ ] . for 124 companions without 2mass photometry",
    "the @xmath25 color is estimated from the @xmath30 photographic magnitudes as described by @xcite .",
    "the color - magnitude selection is illustrated in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "the top panel shows @xmath26_{\\rm sec}$ ] as a function of @xmath25 for all 608 pairs with angular separations @xmath31 , with the selection range for ms stars in red , and the selection range for wds shown in blue .",
    "the bottom panel in figure  [ fig : cmd ] shows the same distribution but for 240 pairs with angular separations in the @xmath32 range .",
    "note that the two ranges cover the same area on the sky , so if all cpm pairs were the result of chance alignments , one would expect the two samples to have similar numbers .",
    "instead we find an excess of 368 pairs at closer separations .",
    "in addition , the color - magnitude distribution is very different in the two samples .",
    "most pairs with @xmath32 fall outside of the ms or wd bands , while the majority of the close pairs have colors consistent with true companions .",
    "this demonstrates that @xmath33 cpm pairs in our catalog are physical , binary / multiple systems .",
    "the color - magnitude selection reduces the catalog to only 2078 pairs with consistent colors .",
    "a histogram of the number of pairs as a function of their angular separation @xmath21 is shown in figure  [ fig : disthist ] .",
    "the distribution for pairs with consistent parallax / photometric distances ( bottom panel ) is compared to the distribution of pairs where the primary and secondary do not have colors consistent with physical association ( top panel ) .",
    "the latter distribution shows the trend expected from chance alignments , i.e. a linear increase with @xmath21 proportional to the increase in the area of sky ; this is modeled by the red line .",
    "the distribution of stars with consistent ms or wd color - magnitude , however , shows a marked excess of pairs with @xmath34 , which again points to the existence of physical pairs . at larger angular separations",
    "@xmath35 , the distribution shows the linear increase expected from chance alignments ; the red line shows the predicted trend based on the number of pairs with @xmath36 .",
    "one notices that while a significant number of physical pairs are undoubtedly detected at @xmath37 , this sub - sample still suffers from contamination from chance alignments .",
    "we note that some companions share common proper motion with more than one _ hipparcos _ star .",
    "likewise some _ hipparcos _ stars have several cpm companions .",
    "some are genuine multiple systems ( triples ) , but in most cases they are more likely to be the result of chance alignments , e.g. the alignment of a foreground / background proper motion star with a true physical pair . in any case , all possible pairings are retained in our list .",
    "magnitudes and colors of 386 companions place them in the wd band in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "they are found in smaller numbers than ms candidates , and are significantly more affected by contamination .",
    "indeed , only 21 pairs have @xmath38 , and some of those are expected to be chance alignments .",
    "we evaluated the number of physical wd companions within some separation @xmath21 by their excess over the linear distribution , as in figure  [ fig : disthist ] , and found that the number of likely physical pairs with wd companions does not increase beyond @xmath39 , reaching an excess of around 10 pairs .    since the vast majority of the stars falling in the wd region are thus chance alignments , we removed form the catalog all companions in the wd band with @xmath40 , keeping only the 21 most likely pairs .",
    "the selection of cpm pairs is sensitive to faint members of the hyades and pleiades clusters , whose members have proper motions within the @xmath41 40 mas yr@xmath1 limit of the superblink catalog , and are thus generally detected . some nearby young associations and moving groups also have members detected in superblink @xcite .",
    "faint cluster stars share a proper motion with the brighter members , which are also _ hipparcos _ sources .",
    "cluster stars have photometric distances consistent with the parallax of the brighter members , so they will generally meet our selection criteria for cpm pairs with colors and magnitudes consistent with physical companions .",
    "we wish , however , to exclude those pairings because they are not physical binaries .",
    "we thus eliminate 311 pairs where the primary stars are known members of clusters and associations according to the xhip catalog @xcite . of those ,",
    "230 belong to the hyades .",
    "this leaves 1392 cpm companions with ms colors and 21 companions with wd colors in the catalog .      in the catalog compilation and analysis presented below we",
    "assume implicitly that both the primary and wide secondary companion are themselves single stars , i.e. there are no unresolved companions .",
    "in reality a substantial but still poorly known fraction of the components in wide systems are themselves close binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "internal orbital motion can contribute additional components to the proper motions and increase @xmath42 with the primary .",
    "analysis of astrometric binaries among fg dwarfs within 67pc listed by @xcite shows that for 86% of them the difference between long - term and _ hipparcos _ proper motion is less than 25mas yr@xmath1 .",
    "therefore , our catalog may be slightly biased against triple systems .    to verify this",
    ", we simulated a realistic population of sub - systems around primary targets with periods from 1yr to 1000yr susceptible to create @xmath24 by photo - center motion during the 3.2-yr long _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "maximum effect is produced at periods from 4yr to 40yr , but the mean and median @xmath42 do not exceed 6mas  yr@xmath1 at 50pc distance ; in 90% of cases",
    "@xmath43mas  yr@xmath1 for all periods . according to these simulations , the fraction of multiple systems rejected by the @xmath44mas  yr@xmath1",
    "threshold should be significantly smaller than the 14% implied by the paper of @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy is alleviated by including in the simulation some massive companions that are close binaries and cause larger @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "multiple systems can also be missed because of inaccurate or distorted photometry .",
    "visual magnitudes in the superblink catalog are largely based on photographic measurements , and sometimes have large errors , especially if the star is blended with another source , such as in the vicinity of a very bright primary or in a dense field .",
    "the composite magnitudes of unresolved sub - systems also bias photometric distance estimates which might yield to rejection based on color and magnitude  although the 1.5 magnitude selection range ( see section   2.1 ) mitigates this effect . in any case",
    ", this may be another non - negligible , but poorly quantified , incompleteness factor for hierarchical systems with cpm companions .",
    "the complete catalog of 1413 cpm pairs is listed in table  1 , the full version of which is available electronically .",
    "the presentation has some similarity with lb2007 .",
    "the first columns contain information on the primary target : ( 1 ) _ hipparcos _ number hip@xmath45 , ( 2 ) superblink identification , ( 3,4 ) equatorial icrs coordinates at the 2000.0 epoch in degrees , ( 5,6 ) proper motions in ra and dec in arcsec  yr@xmath1 , ( 7 ) @xmath18 magnitudes derived from the dss for faint stars or taken from _",

    "similarly , missing magnitudes are listed as 99 .",
    "photometric parallaxes in column ( 29 ) estimated from the @xmath50 relation have code phot in column ( 31 ) , their errors are set to zero .",

    "we emphasize again that this catalog contains all cpm pairs identified using the selection method described in  2 , and includes not only physical binaries but also a significant number of chance alignments .",
    "one should therefore _ not _ assume that the catalog lists true companions of the _ hipparcos _ stars , and the user should keep an eye on column 17 , which provides a probability for the pair to be physical .",

    "the catalog is still incomplete at @xmath55 .",
    "the distribution of companions on the sky is uniform , but with fewer stars south of @xmath56 due to the larger proper motion cutoff .",
    "interestingly , there is no obvious concentration towards the galactic plane .",

    "the number of fg dwarfs within distance @xmath58 is proportional to @xmath59 in our catalog , whereas it is close to @xmath60 in _ hipparcos _ ; the difference is caused by the proper motion selection . in this section we do not consider the 21 wd candidate companions and analyze only the 1392 ms companions .",
    "the parallax distributions for close and wide companions in our catalog are slightly different ; the median parallax is 22.1mas and 17.1mas for @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively .",
    "distant stars have , on average , a smaller proper motion and a larger number of optical companions , producing this correlation between @xmath63 and @xmath21 .      figure  [ fig : dmu - sep ] plots proper motion difference @xmath42 for the pairs with main sequence secondaries against their angular separation @xmath21 .",

    "physical companions with @xmath72mas yr@xmath1 are indeed identified in lb2007 .",

    "saturation of the stars on the plates may lead to systematic errors , and a slight over - estimation of @xmath18 could create the discontinuity of the @xmath52 distribution seen in figure  [ fig : v2-sep ] .",
    "there is , however , an alternative explanation .",
    "one can see from figure  [ fig : v2-sep ] that the gap is most apparent in the very wide secondaries , which are largely dominated with chance alignments , and much less obvious in the close ( @xmath80 ) pairs .",
    "while any field star could potentially be selected as cpm secondary based on proper motion alone , our color - magnitude requirement eliminates most of the foreground and background contaminants , because their colors and magnitude would not fit the expected ms at the distance of the star .",
    "exceptions to this rule are background giant and subgiant stars , which generally can not be distinguished from foreground ms stars based on color and magnitude .",
    "effectively , this causes an excess of ( chance alignment ) wide cpm secondaries in the @xmath81 magnitude range ; fainter subgiants are not found in the superblink catalog because of the distance bias introduced by the high proper motion cut .",
    "this over - selection of bright giants / subgiants conspires with the rising luminosity function of field stars to create the magnitude gap for wide companions .    a color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of the companion candidates",
    "is plotted in figure  [ fig : cmd ] .",
    "there is no clear separation between optical and physical companions in this cmd , but the statistics of the deviation from the nominal ms @xmath82_{\\rm   sec }   - [ m_v]_{\\rm   ms}$ ] ( see section 2.1 ) is different between those two groups .",

    "the @xmath85 distribution of close companions is however normal with a dispersion of @xmath88 and zero average .",
    "our cutoff of @xmath89 ( @xmath90 ) rejects only 1% of this normal distribution .",
    "this indicates that our color - magnitude selection misses very few ms companions .",
    "a reduction of the cutoff would likely reduce the contamination by optical pairs , but would result in a lower completeness for physical systems .",
    "we expect that the number of _ optical _",
    "( i.e. chance alignment ) companions closer than @xmath21 should be proportional to @xmath91 . physical companions , on the other hand , are expected to be distributed almost uniformly in @xmath65 ( pik s law , * ? ? ?",

    "this simple model with only two free parameters fits well the observed distribution of separations in figure  [ fig : model ] with @xmath101 and @xmath102 .",
    "the estimated fraction of optical companions in our catalog is therefore @xmath103 , so it appears to contain about 425 physical wide pairs .",

    "only 133 companions have intermediate @xmath110 between 0.2 and 0.8 , most of them with separations of few hundred arcseconds .",
    "we checked the estimates of @xmath110 on 175 companions with trigonometric parallaxes of @xmath111mas or better precision and found that for all pairs with @xmath112 the parallaxes of primary and secondary companions match within errors , thus confirming the physical nature of those pairs .",
    "however , 39 wide pairs with @xmath113 ( out of 70 ) also have parallaxes that match within 5mas and are probably physical .",
    "our estimates of @xmath110 based on empirical data modeling are therefore useful as a guidance but should not be taken too literally .",
    "@xcite also included the mean proper motion of the pair @xmath57 in their statistical model and showed that the probability of optical companions is proportional to @xmath114 , i.e. that cpm pairs with larger proper motions are more likely to be physical .",
    "this analysis , however , neglected the role of color - magnitude selection in eliminating background contaminants , here represented by @xmath115 .",
    "in addition , lb2007 used @xmath116 as a cutoff , which introduced incompleteness at large separations by restricting the range of @xmath42 values . for these reasons we decided not to include @xmath57 in the statistical criteria used to separate physical and optical companions , instead relying on @xmath115 to eliminate most optical pairs at large angular separations .    to summarize",
    ", the current catalog of cpm companions to _ hipparcos _ stars contains a mixture of physical and optical companions with different statistical properties such as distributions of separations , @xmath67 , magnitudes , and colors .",
    "we develop a model for these distributions which we use to evaluate the probability of membership in either of the two groups .",
    "additional parameters , such as total proper motion @xmath57 , could be used to refine those probability estimates , but are not applied here for simplicity and uniformity .",
    "the masses of the primary and secondary components are evaluated here from their absolute magnitudes @xmath117 using the relation from @xcite for dwarfs and assuming that both companions are single ( although binarity has little effect on estimated mass ) .",
    "the mass - magnitude relation in the @xmath118 band is less sensitive to age and metallicity , compared to optical magnitudes .",
    "evolved stars do not obey the relation for dwarfs , and as a result are assigned masses above @xmath119 owing to their high luminosity . in any case , 87% of primary components have estimated masses between 0.6 and 1.5@xmath120 , i.e. are nearby solar - type dwarfs .",
    "the narrow range of masses for the primaries is of course achieved by design , from a combination of the 67pc distance limit and the magnitude limit of the _ hipparcos _ catalog itself .",
    "massive stars are rare in the vicinity of the sun , and most @xmath1210.6@xmath120 dwarfs in the 67pc volume are below the _ hipparcos _ magnitude limit .",
    "the secondary components , in contrast , span a range of masses from 0.1@xmath120 up to the mass of the primary component , consistent with our broad detection of secondary stars down to the @xmath122 magnitude limit of the superblink survey .    a comparison of the estimated masses of the primary and secondary components is shown in figure  [ fig : massplot ] for the 403 pairs with @xmath123 .",
    "the majority of mass ratios @xmath124 are comprised between 0.1 and 1 ; we set @xmath125 in a few cases where @xmath126 ( which happens because the @xmath18 magnitudes are used to define which star is the primary / secondary whereas the @xmath118 magnitudes are used to estimate their masses ) .",
    "the scarcity of very low - mass companions is obvious in the cmd ( figure  [ fig : cmd ] ) by the scarcity of points with @xmath127 or spectral types later than m6v . at 67pc ( distance modulus 4.12 )",
    "a @xmath16 star near the superblink magnitude limit corresponds to a 0.12@xmath120 dwarf with @xmath128 , according to the standard relations of @xcite .",
    "therefore , the catalog is incomplete below @xmath129 , although cpm companions of lower mass are found around some of the nearest primaries in the catalog .",
    "the mass ratio of wide binaries has approximately uniform distribution ( figure  [ fig : qhist ] ) .",
    "excluding the first bin affected by incompleteness , we fit the distribution by a power law @xmath130 with @xmath131 .",
    "this matches the result of @xcite who found uniformly distributed mass ratio for all binaries independently of their period , and the result of @xcite who studied the mass - ratio distribution of companions within @xmath132 and also found it to be uniform .",
    "hierarchical multiples are neglected by this analysis .",
    "however , we observe a prominent local minimum around @xmath133 , which is apparent in figure  [ fig : qhist ] and corresponds to companions of @xmath134 mass with @xmath26_{\\rm   sec } \\sim 10 $ ] and @xmath135 . at a typical distance of 50pc",
    "such companions have @xmath136 .",
    "as noted above , superblink is expected to be complete in this magnitude range .",
    "however , systematic errors in the @xmath52 magnitudes may affect the position in the cmd ( figure  1 ) , leading to a rejection of some physical companions .",
    "recently @xcite found cpm companions to exo - planet hosts with high proper motion ; one of those , hip  112414 ( @xmath137 , @xmath138 , @xmath139mas  yr@xmath1 ) is overlooked in our catalog .",
    "yet , we see only few such potentially rejected companions on the right side of the ms band in figure  [ fig : cmd ] , which suggests that such rejections should be relatively unfrequent , and can not explain the observed deficit at @xmath140 .",
    "companion masses estimated from the @xmath141 magnitudes are not affected by any systematic errors of @xmath52 . however , the standard relation of @xcite used here changes slope at @xmath142 , contributing to the deficit of estimated masses around @xmath143 .",
    "use of an alternative smooth relation between mass and @xmath117 decreases the depth of the minimum around @xmath144 , without however getting rid of it entirely .",
    "should the minimum be real , it might indicate a bimodal distribution in the masses of the wide secondaries .",
    "a population of roughly equal - mass systems , combined with another where the secondaries have a mass distribution similar to field stars , could produce a bimodal distribution of mass ratios such as the one suggested here .",
    "because of the relatively small number of systems in the present study , this apparent deficit at @xmath145 should be confirmed before it can be accepted as real .",
    "projected orbital separations @xmath3 for our wide systems can be calculated from @xmath146 .",
    "the separations are statistically related to the orbital semi - major axis @xmath98 .",
    "simulations show that in most cases the ratio @xmath147 is comprised between 0.5 and 2 and the median of @xmath147 is close to 1.0 ( it depends slightly on the eccentricity distribution ) .",
    "we plot the distribution of orbital separations against the distance of the pair from the sun in figure  [ fig : diagram ] .",
    "the range of projected orbital separations over which our survey is sensitive is defined by the lower and upper limits of angular separations , which are noted by the dashed lines .",
    "the majority of the pairs have @xmath148 ; over that range our census is complete for systems with projected orbital separations @xmath149 . in that regime",
    ", the distribution of projected angular separations appears to be uniform over log(@xmath3 ) up to a projected separation of 10kau , beyond which the density increases significantly .",
    "this increase in density marks the increasing contamination from optical pairs ( i.e. chance alignments ) .    for evaluating the companion frequency ,",
    "we define the _ reference sample _ of _ hipparcos _ stars that fulfill the selection criteria of our catalog on distance ( @xmath150mas ) and proper motion ( @xmath4140mas yr@xmath1 north of @xmath14 and @xmath41150mas yr@xmath1 otherwise ) .",
    "we evaluate their masses by the same method as for the catalog targets using @xmath118-band magnitudes from xhip @xcite ; for a small subset without 2mass photometry , @xmath18 magnitudes were used instead .",
    "the reference sample is not complete within its distance limit .",
    "it only serves to relate the number of cpm companions in our catalog to the total number of primary stars with similar characteristics .    in the following ,",
    "we apply additional selection criteria on @xmath151 , @xmath57 , and mass of primary components to both our catalog and reference sample .",
    "we also limit the analysis to primary stars in the mass range 0.7@xmath152m@xmath1211.4@xmath120 , which includes 77% of the pairs in our catalog .    to derive the distribution of projected separations , we need to account for the optical companions which contaminate the sample .",
    "we can not use here the estimates of @xmath110 because they depend on @xmath21 and hence bias the result . considering a restricted range of parallax values",
    ", we estimate the number of optical companions in five bins of projected orbital separations ( see figure  [ fig : diagram ] ) , by translating their limits @xmath153 into angular separation limits @xmath154 using the average parallax of the selected stars .",
    "then @xmath155 , where the parameter @xmath156 is evaluated from the number of companions between 1200and 1800 , assuming they are all optical in that range ( a slight over - estimate ) .",
    "the estimate of @xmath157 relies mostly on companions with @xmath158kau , outside the range of separations studied here .",
    "the procedure to derive the separation distribution is thus as follows .",
    "a subset of the catalog satisfying some additional criteria is chosen and the number of reference targets @xmath159 satisfying the same criteria is found .",
    "the histogram of projected separations @xmath160 is constructed and the estimated number of optical pair contaminants is subtracted from each bin @xmath161 to get @xmath162 .",
    "the companion frequency is @xmath163 .",
    "we ignore the tiny incompleteness of the fifth ( 3264)kau bin .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fig : rhist ] shows the result for all stars with solar - type primaries ( masses from 0.7@xmath120 to 1.4@xmath120 ) .",
    "this selects 518 companions , 227 of which should be physical , while @xmath164 .",
    "the total frequency of companions between 2kau and 64kau is therefore @xmath165% .",
    "we do not find any strong dependence of companion fraction on the mass of the primary .",
    "the total binary fraction , however , critically depends on the subtraction of optical pairs , especially in the the last two bins which are significantly affected by the contamination .",
    "the first three bins contain 180 physical companions , or 3.8@xmath1660.3% per decade of separation , and are not much affected by the contamination .",
    "our catalog is incomplete for companions of very low masses ( @xmath167 ) .",
    "the magnitude of this incompleteness depends on the actual distribution of @xmath168 : if the distribution is uniform all the way down to @xmath169 , then the catalog misses only 15% of low - mass companions . however , the number of sub - stellar companions is probably small ( the so - called brown - dwarf desert ) and the incompleteness at low @xmath168 is correspondingly less .",
    "wide triples may also be under - represented due to our color - magnitude selection ( see  [ sec : mult ] ) , though the losses are probably modest . assuming that our census of wide companions is 80% complete",
    ", their true frequency would be 5.5% .",
    "this value corroborates the result from @xcite , who estimated that 5.9% of nearby dwarfs have companions with @xmath170kau .",
    "more critical to the analysis is whether the distribution of orbital separations is flat with log @xmath3 or undergoes a significant decline . by limiting our analysis to subsets of pairs with larger proper motions",
    ", we can substantially reduce the optical contamination , although at the expense of sample size .",
    "both the distributions of orbital separations @xmath3 and the total companion fraction derived from this restricted sample ( bottom panel of figure  [ fig : rhist ] ) are very similar to the results for the full sample , and strongly support a decline with log @xmath3 .",
    "we see only a slight reduction of the companion fraction with increasing @xmath57 cutoff : @xmath171% for @xmath172mas  yr@xmath1 and @xmath173% for @xmath174mas  yr@xmath1 .",
    "the slight reduction for stars with higher proper motions could be consistent with those stars being statistically older , and thus more susceptible to disruption .",
    "in addition , the distribution in @xmath65 is also declining , as evidenced by @xmath175 in the model ( [ eq : model ] ) .",
    "the slope is @xmath176 per decade ( the range of @xmath21 is 1.78dex ) , in excellent agreement with @xmath177 found here by a different method .",
    "the distribution of physical companions for solar - mass stars in the vicinity of the sun in @xmath178 is thus declining faster than pik s law : @xmath179 with @xmath180 ( where @xmath181 would correspond to pik s law ) .",
    "this conclusion is valid at least over the 2kau@xmath18220kau range .",
    "a deficit of wide binaries at large separations ( or periods ) relative to the pik s law was also documented by @xcite , and suggested by @xcite using a subset of our current data .",
    "this decline is supported by the current , extended sample .",
    "@xcite found a declining distribution with @xmath183 at @xmath184kau ; the slightly faster decline could however be the result of an additional selection criterion ( @xmath185 ) which favors closer binaries .",
    "figure  [ fig : r10 ] compares the empirical distribution of separations with two possible analytical models : a simple power law , and the log - normal period distribution of @xcite . for the latter ,",
    "the median period @xmath186d , logarithmic dispersion 2.28 , and binary frequency 0.5 was converted to the distribution of semi - major axis by assuming total mass of 1.5@xmath120 and total sample size @xmath187 .",
    "the agreement with the log - normal distribution is better than one might expect , given the fact that their sample does not overlap with the stars studied here and that the analysis methods are different .",
    "the frequency of 500-au companions to fg dwarfs is higher , 13% per decade of separation @xcite .",
    "this agrees with the distribution declining at long orbital periods .",
    "indeed , extrapolation from the first three bins ( geometric mean @xmath188kau , frequency 3.8% per decade ) to @xmath189au with the @xmath190 power law predicts 3.4 times more companions , 13% per decade .",
    "in other words , the @xmath190 law seems to hold at separations less than 1kau .",
    "we have searched for wide companions to _ hipparcos _ stars in the superblink proper motion catalog based on common proper motion .",
    "the main results are :    * the mass ratio of wide companions to nearby solar - mass dwarfs is found to be distributed uniformly to first order , with a possible deficit of companions with mass ratios @xmath8 . *",
    "the distribution of projected separation @xmath3 declines as @xmath191 , faster than the pik s law . *",
    "total frequency of wide companions to solar - type dwarfs with @xmath192kau is @xmath193% .",
    "the frequency in the range from 2 to 16kau is @xmath6% per decade of separation .",
    "both numbers are lower limits because a fraction of wide companions is missed .",
    "in addition , our search has produced a catalog of 1413 cpm companions to _ hipparcos _ stars .",
    "the present catalog gives the most complete census of wide cpm companions to nearby stars available to date .",
    "a decline in companion frequency at large @xmath3 found here can be used to constrain gravitational perturbations in the galactic field .",
    "we found 21 potential wd companions to nearby stars ( table  [ tab : wd ] ) .",
    "half of those should be true wds , the rest are faint background stars .",
    "indeed , 5 wd companions are already known in the literature , 6 look promising based on their separation and pm .",
    "our catalog contains new wide companions to exo - planet host stars @xcite , in addition to previously known cpm companions .",
