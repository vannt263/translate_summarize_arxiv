    "the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) is a widely used tool for numerical simulations of fluid flows .",
    "it has become over the years one the of the major engineering tools for computational fluid mechanics .",
    "it describes the flow thanks to the time evolution of the velocity distribution function which is only modified through the effect of inter - particle collisions .",
    "the most commonly used lattice boltzmann collision model is the single relaxation time model or bgk ( for bhathagar , gross and krook , see @xcite ) .",
    "this model is able to asymptotically represent weakly compressible fluids ( through a chapman ",
    "enskog expansion , see @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless it suffers from stability issues especially at high reynolds numbers .",
    "these issues are due to the `` ghost - modes '' ( see @xcite for a discussion ) which are non - physical moments present in any lbm simulation in excess of the density ( pressure ) , velocity and stress .",
    "this issue has been addressed by several authors and several solutions have been proposed .",
    "the first is the multiple - relaxation - time ( mrt ) approach ( see @xcite among others ) which uses a more complex collision model involving several relaxation times adjusted with the help of a linear stability analysis in order to optimize their dispersion / dissipation relations .",
    "the entropic approach ensures the positivity of the distribution functions and hence the unconditional stability by adding an @xmath2-theorem to the bgk model .",
    "the effect of the @xmath2-theorem is essentially to increase locally the viscous dissipation of the model ( see @xcite among others ) .",
    "the regularization approach ( see @xcite ) which can be interpreted as a subclass of mrt methods where the `` ghost - modes '' are relaxed towards zero with characteristic time 1 .",
    "finally the selective viscosity models proposed by @xcite use non - local low - pass filters to remove high frequency oscillations ( which are responsible for the numerical instabilities ) in order to increase the stability .    in this paper we will first show a recursive way to compute the moments of the distribution function as long as the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion is valid ( low knudsen number ) for the bgk collision operator .",
    "this recursive relation will then be used to `` regularize '' the distribution function and provide a very stable and accurate scheme even at moderately high reynolds numbers and ( relatively ) high mach numbers ( smaller than one though ) .",
    "we also show that the present model is more accurate and more stable than the existing mrt methods by performing a linear stability analysis and several numerical benchmarks .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec_lbm ] a reminder of fundamentals for fluid flows with the boltzmann ",
    "bgk equation is presented . then in sec .",
    "[ sec_rec ] the new model is proposed and analyzed .",
    "it is validated in sec .",
    "[ sec_bench ] on a 2d and a 3d benchmark .",
    "finally the present work is concluded in sec .",
    "[ sec_concl ] and perspectives are given .",
    "the following section aims at introducing the basic notations as well as showing the fundamentals of the expansion leading from the continuous boltzmann - bgk equation to the navier  stokes equations .",
    "more details can be found in @xcite and @xcite for example .",
    "the boltzmann equation describes the time evolution of the velocity density probability distribution @xmath3 of finding a particle with velocity @xmath4 at position @xmath5 and time @xmath6 in terms of particle collisions only , and reads in absence of a force as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the collision operator . assuming also that the fluid is athermal ( absence of temperature ) , the macroscopic fields of interest , the density @xmath9 , the velocity @xmath10 , and the stress tensor @xmath11 are given by the following moments of the distribution function @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the microscopic velocity in the co - moving frame and @xmath14 denotes the tensor product of @xmath15 with itself .",
    "the most widely used model for computational fluid dynamics for the collision operator is the bgk , single relaxation time approximation , in which the boltzmann equation reads @xmath16 where @xmath17 the relaxation time , and @xmath18 is the local maxwell  boltzmann equilibrium distribution function , which in non - dimensional units is given by @xmath19 @xmath20 being the physical dimension .    since we are interested in numerically solving eq .",
    "in an efficient fashion that nevertheless represents accurately fluid flows , certain simplifications will be made .",
    "in particular instead of considering the complete form of the maxwell  boltzmann distribution function , only a polynomial approximation will be used .",
    "following an idea by @xcite ( or @xcite for the original use of this expansion in the frame of the boltzmann equation ) , one can expand the distribution functions @xmath21 and @xmath18 , in hermite polynomials up to an arbitrary order @xmath22 ( see @xcite for a summary on hermite polynomials ) @xmath23 where the colon symbol `` : '' stands for the full index contraction .",
    "the hermite polynomials of order @xmath24 and the associated gaussian weight are noted @xmath25 and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the hermite coefficients of @xmath21 and @xmath18 of degree @xmath24 are respectively given by @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "from now on , we will always omit the superscript @xmath22 and assume that the distribution function ( and its equilibrium counterpart ) is represented by its approximate form in terms of hermite polynomials up to an arbitrary order @xmath22 except when explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "the equilibrium coefficients can be easily computed and are found to be up to order three @xmath29    in order to recover the macroscopic equations of motion related with the bgk equation , one must take moments of eq .  .",
    "by taking the moments related with density ( order zero ) and momentum ( order one ) of this equation , one gets after some algebra and the use of eqs .  - and - @xmath30",
    "these equations are obtained under the sole assumption of mass and momentum conservation ( @xmath31 ) , or in other terms @xmath32    the momentum conservation equation still needs to be closed ( a constitutive equation must be found for @xmath11 ) . in order to do so",
    ", one can use the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion ( see @xcite ) . since the expansion in hermite series is used for discretization purposes we will discuss the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion in this frame ( although the hermite series is not a prerequisite for performing the chapman  enskog expansion ) .",
    "the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion is based on the assumption that the distribution function @xmath21 is given by the sum of the equilibrium distribution , @xmath18 , plus a small perturbation noted @xmath33 , @xmath34 where the equilibrium distribution is assumed to be given by eq .  .",
    "the perturbation , @xmath35 , is of the order of the knudsen number , @xmath36 . as for @xmath21 and @xmath18",
    "one can express @xmath33 in terms of a hermite series @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the hermite coefficient of @xmath33 at order @xmath24 .",
    "the derivation which is presented hereafter is not the standard one found in the literature and rather follows @xcite .    replacing the chapman ",
    "enskog ansatz in eq .",
    ", one obtains at the lowest order @xmath39 taking the zeroth and first order moments of this equation and using the mass and momentum conservation constrains on each equation respectively ( @xmath40 ) , one gets the inviscid euler equations for mass , momentum and energy conservation @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the perfect gas law ( remember that there is no temperature ) .",
    "the stress tensor can be decomposed in its chapman ",
    "enskog counterparts @xmath43 where @xmath44 for @xmath45 ( @xmath46 corresponding to the chapman ",
    "enskog index ) .",
    "thus we are left with the computation of @xmath47 which for simplicity is computed through the hermite expansion of the distribution function .",
    "let us define @xmath48 the hermite coefficient of order @xmath24 of the off - equilibrium distribution function @xmath33 and express @xmath47 in terms of these hermite coefficients @xmath49 where we used that by construction @xmath50 .",
    "then projecting eq .   on the hermite basis",
    ", it follows that @xmath51 where `` perm '' stands for all the cyclic index permutations . for @xmath52",
    "this equation becomes @xmath53 by using eqs .  - to eliminate the time derivative terms , this equation can be rewritten ( after some tedious algebra that can be found in @xcite ) as @xmath54 where @xmath55    by comparing eq .   with the navier ",
    "stokes equations , the transport coefficient @xmath56 can be identified with the relaxation time through the following relation @xmath57 finally the equations of motion obtained are the weakly compressible athermal navier  stokes equations @xmath58",
    "in this section a novel theoretical approach is proposed for the athermal boltzmann - bgk equation . a recursive formulation for non - equilibrium moments is shown to exist and a regularization technique is proposed for the discrete lattice boltzmann method .",
    "the particular structure of the moments of the equilibrium distribution in absence of temperature allows for an elegant formulation of the high order ( higher than two ) non - equilibrium moments .",
    "the hermite coefficients of order @xmath24 of the equilibrium distribution can be recursively expressed as @xmath59 using this relation and eqs .  - one can show that for @xmath60 ( see [ app_ce_rec ] for the proof ) @xmath61 where `` perm@xmath62 '' stands for all the cyclic index permutations of indexes from @xmath63 to @xmath64 ( @xmath65 is never permuted ) .",
    "one therefore notices that a hermite coefficient of order @xmath24 can be expressed in terms of the the velocity and the hermite coefficients of order order two and @xmath66 .",
    "this property allows to reconstruct the populations up to any order by only knowing its second order coefficient and the macroscopic velocity .",
    "we notice that only the hermite coefficients of the distribution function are used in the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion .",
    "therefore in order to asymptotically recover the navier ",
    "stokes equations there is no need to use the complete maxwell  boltzmann equilibrium distribution but only a polynomial expansion of it . in order to discretize the velocity space one will use a gauss  hermite quadrature .",
    "the aim of this discretization is to exactly evaluate the integral of polynomials of order @xmath67 with gaussian weight as a sum @xmath68 where @xmath69 and @xmath70 are two sets of @xmath71 constant weights and abscissae respectively .    in order to obtain asymptotically the weakly compressible limit of the bgk equation",
    "only polynomials of order @xmath72 need to be integrated exactly .",
    "the associated most common quadratures ( see  @xcite ) for this case are given by the d2q9 ( in 2d ) and the d3q15 , d3q19 , and d3q27 latticesq@xmath71 notation denotes a lattice of dimension @xmath73 and with @xmath71 quadrature points ] ( in 3d ) .",
    "these quadratures allow the definition of a set of velocity discretized distribution function noted as @xmath74 .",
    "in other terms , on each position @xmath5 at time @xmath6 one defines @xmath71 independent values @xmath75 .",
    "these quantities can therefore be represented on a @xmath71-dimensional basis ( see work of @xcite among others ) .",
    "we emphasize here is that there are two different spaces that must be distinguished : the velocity - discretized @xmath71-dimensional space and the @xmath73-dimensional physical space .",
    "the above quadratures only allow the exact representation of the populations up to second order in hermite polynomials , one usually truncates eq .   to order two .",
    "this means that the equilibrium distribution is represented on a six - dimensional basis in 2d and respectively on a 10-dimensional basis in 3d , while it is living in a 9 ( for the d2q9 lattice ) or 15 , 19 , or 27 ( for the d3q15 , d3q19 , or d3q27 lattices ) dimensional space ( depending on the quadrature used ) .",
    "the bgk equation discretized in microscopic velocity space then reads @xmath76 as pointed out above , the set populations ( @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) live in a @xmath71-dimensional space which means that they can be represented on a @xmath71-dimensional basis . in @xcite or @xcite",
    "different bases are proposed for the expansion of the complete populations but never used to express the equilibrium distribution . here",
    "we propose to expand the equilibrium population on a complete basis as well . to this aim",
    "we will use an interesting property of the d2q9 and the d3q27 lattices , which is that the complete 9- and 27-dimensional bases can be expressed in hermite polynomials , a property that does not hold for the d3q15 and d3q19 quadratures .",
    "this property makes them particularly appealing in order to reuse all the calculations performed in the previous section .",
    "the distribution function is therefore written as ( in 2d ) @xmath79 respectively the equilibrium and off - equilibrium parts are expanded as @xmath80 in 3d the equivalent expressions are given by @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 the hermite coefficients of the equilibrium distribution are the ones obtained from of the continuous equilibrium distribution for both the 2d and 3d cases , simplifying the computations .",
    "another important remark is that not all the hermite polynomials are used at each order .",
    "this is due to the fact that the quadrature is not accurate enough to represent exactly all the hermite polynomials , but only the ones that are used in the formulas above .",
    "the chapman ",
    "enskog expansion of this model asymptotically leads to the following constitutive equation for @xmath84 in three dimensions @xmath85 where the `` @xmath86 ''",
    "terms are @xmath87 order error terms which are not present in the continuous case ( see eq .  ) . in the case of the order two standard bgk model ( where @xmath78 is only expanded up to order two in hermite polynomials ) it reads @xmath88 where the `` @xmath89 '' terms are the terms that are not present anymore in the new model .",
    "one can see that in our case the non - diagonal terms are exact .",
    "furthermore since we now expand the distribution function up to a limited order in hermite polynomials the relations of eq .",
    "are not anymore exactly verified .",
    "nevertheless the difference between the exact relation and the error committed is compatible with the low compressibility approximation of the scheme ( low mach number approximation ) .",
    "in other terms eq",
    ".   reads in the discrete case @xmath90 where @xmath91 stands for the order of the error committed .",
    "these terms are spurious terms that are due to quadrature ( discretization in velocity space ) errors in the expansion and are assumed to be small because they are one order higher in physical velocity . for a more detailed expression for the @xmath92 terms see [ app_hermite ] .",
    "the time space discretization of eq .",
    "is done as usual by integrating it along characteristics with the trapezoidal rule and making the following change of variables ( see @xcite for example ) @xmath93 this leads to the following lattice boltzmann method scheme @xmath94 where @xmath95 . from now on the `` bar '' is omitted for brevity in the notations .",
    "the numerical scheme used here is given by eq .",
    "where @xmath77 is `` regularized '' at each iteration as done in @xcite @xmath96 where @xmath97 is computed with eqs .   or   depending on the dimension of the physical space .",
    "furthermore the hermite coefficients of eqs .   and   ( @xmath38 , with @xmath98 ) are evaluated thanks to the recursive formulation of eq .  .",

    "in this paper we demonstrated the existence of a recursive formula that allows the reconstruction of the non - equilibrium moments of the boltzmann - bgk equation at any order , only by knowing the lower order moments .",
    "this property allows to propose a regularization procedure for the bgk lattice boltzmann method that is increasing the overall accuracy of the method and removing the majority of the visible spurious modes present in standard bgk and mrt models .",
    "this is shown by two benchmarks : the wall ",
    "dipole interaction ( 2d case ) and the turbulent jet ( 3d case ) .",
    "although in the 2d case the increase in accuracy of the model is not spectacular , the stability is greatly improved . for the 3d case a great improvement",
    "not only the reynolds stresses are found to be more accurately represented ( with respect to the mrt model ) but the pressure spectrum has the expected behavior .    finally one can notice that the model acts like an implicit large eddy simulation model , since the turbulent behavior of the jet is reproduced accurately without any need to use an explicit turbulence model .",
    "its relative simplicity and low cost of implementation make it very appealing for high reynolds number and moderately high mach numbers ( of a maximal value of roughly 0.5 ) .",
    "an interesting optimization of the present scheme could be achieved by using a d3q19/d3q15 quadrature instead of the d3q27 used here .",
    "to do so the recursive formula used throughout this paper should be generalized to alternative basis vectors that are not hermite polynomials .",
    "finally the present approach may also be extensible for higher order quadratures ( and higher order physics where one includes temperature for example ) like thermal and compressible flows where one could reduce dramatically the memory needs of such cases ( which is excessive for the moment since one needs d3q121 quadratures ) .",
    "it could also provide a way to deal with boundary conditions for these kind of models , since with a very limited amount of information , one can reconstruct the complete populations with an accuracy consistent with the model .",
