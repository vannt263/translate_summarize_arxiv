    "two complementary approaches are necessary to understand galaxy evolution : on the one hand , we need to develop theoretical models for galaxy formation , chemical and dynamical evolution , and on the other hand , we need to collect as many and as accurate as possible observational data to constrain such models . in particular , we need to know the masses , chemical abundances and kinematics of the various galactic components , namely gas , stars and dark matter ; we need to know the star formation history ( sfh ) , the initial mass function ( imf ) , etc . in this",
    "review our current knowledge of the sfhs , as derived from the colour - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) of their resolved stellar populations , is summarized",
    ".    resolved stellar populations are the best tracers of the sfh of a galactic region , and their cmd the best tool to exploit the tracers .",
    "this is due to the well known circumstance that the location of any individual star in a cmd is uniquely related to its mass , age and chemical composition . from the cmd",
    "we can thus disentangle directly these evolution parameters . in the case of simple stellar populations ,",
    "i.e. coeval stars with the same chemical composition , isochrone fitting is the most frequently used method to infer the system age . in the case of galaxies , with rather complicated mixtures of different stellar generations ,",
    "the age determination is less straightforward , but their cmds remain the best means to derive the sfh .",

    "the cmd has a much brighter and thicker blue plume .",
    "top - right panel : same constant sfr as in the first case , but with a quiescence interval between 3 and 2 gyrs ago ; a gap appears in the cmd region corresponding to stars 2 - 3 gyr old , which are completely missing .",

    "the six panels of the figure show the effect of different sfhs on the synthetic cmd of a hypothetical galactic region with number of resolved individual stars , photometric errors , blending and incompleteness factors typical of a region in the smc imaged with hst / wfpc2 .",
    "if the sfh of the studied region has been one of the following six cases , then , according to stellar evolution models , the cmd of its stars is one of those shown in fig.[syn1 ] .",
    "the top three panels show examples of cmds typical of late - type galaxies , with ongoing or recent star formation activity .",
    "if the star formation rate ( sfr ) has been constant for all the galaxy lifetime , the cmd of the region is expected to have the morphology of the top - central panel , with a prominent blue plume mostly populated by main - sequence ( ms ) stars and an equally prominent red plume resulting from the overposition of increasingly bright and massive stars in the red giant branch ( rgb ) , asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) and red supergiant phases . at intermediate colours , for decreasing brightness ,",
    "stars in the blue loops and subgiant phases are visible , as well stars at the oldest ms turnoff ( msto ) and on the faint ms of low mass stars .",
    "stars of all ages are present , from those as old as the hubble time to the brightest ones a few tens myr old .",
    "if we leave the sfh unchanged except for the addition of a burst ten times stronger concentrated in the last 20 myr , the cmd ( top - left panel ) has a much brighter and more populated blue plume , now containing also stars a few myr old . in the top - right panel the same constant sfr as in the first case is assumed , but with a quiescent interval between 3 and 2 gyrs ago : a gap is clearly visible in the cmd region corresponding to the age of the missing stars .",
    "the three bottom panels of fig.[syn1 ] show cmds typical of early - type galaxies , whose sf activity is concentrated at the earliest epochs .",
    "if only one sf episode has occurred from 13 to 10 gyr ago , with a constant metallicity z=0.004 as in the top panel cases , the resulting cmd is shown in the bottom - central panel .",
    "if the sf has occurred at the same epoch , but with a metallicity ten times lower , the evolutionary phases in the resulting cmd ( bottom - right panel ) have colours and luminosities quite different from the previous case . finally , the bottom - left panel shows the case of two bursts , the first from 13 to 11 gyr ago and the second from 5 to 4 gyr ago .",
    "the gap corresponding to the quiescent interval is evident in the cmd , although not as much as the more recent gap of the top - right panel .",
    "the tight dependence of the cmd morphology on the sfh is the cornerstone of the synthetic cmd method , which consists in comparing the observational cmd of a galactic region with synthetic cmds , such as those of fig.[syn1 ] , created via monte  carlo extractions on stellar evolution tracks or isochrones for a variety of sfhs , imfs , binary fractions and age - metallicity relations ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "the synthetic cmds take into account the number of stars , photometric errors , incompleteness and blending factors of the observational cmd ( or portions of it ) .",
    "hence , a combination of assumed parameters is acceptable only if the resulting synthetic cmd reproduces all the features of the observational one : morphology , colours , luminosity functions , number of stars in specific evolutionary phases .",
    "the method does not provide unique solutions , but significantly reduces the possible sfh scenarios .    at its first applications to photometric data from ground - based , moderate size telescopes",
    "the synthetic cmd method demonstrated its power , showing that even in tiny galaxies such as local group dwarf irregulars ( dirrs ) the sfh varies from one region to the other and that their star formation regime is rather continuous , with long episodes of moderate activity , separated by short quiescent intervals ( the so - called gasping regime , ( * ? ? ?",

    "many people developped their own procedures and to date a large fraction of local group galaxies have had the sfh of at least some of their regions derived with the synthetic cmd method . nowadays , in lg galaxies",
    "it is possible to resolve individual stars down to faint / old objects in all galactic regions and we can thus infer the sfhs over long lookback times @xmath0 ( up to the hubble time ) , with an average time resolution around ( 0.10.2)@xmath0 .",
    "the current census of lg galaxies with sfh derived in some of their regions with the synthetic cmd method is impressive .",
    "sfhs have been inferred from cmds of both the two external spiral galaxies , m31 and m33 , the two magellanic clouds , lmc and smc , a dozen dirrs , 5 transition type dwarfs and about 20 early - type dwarfs ( dwarf spheroidals , dsphs , and dwarf ellipticals , des ) .    in m31",

    "the exquisite spatial resolution of hst is necessary to resolve and study the fainter stars in crowded regions , such as those of the star forming clusters .",
    "while stars at the oldest mstos and subgiant branches are the unique means to firmly establish the sfh at the earliest epochs , pre - ms stars are precious tools to study the details of the most recent sfh in terms of time and space behaviour ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "to find sfhs peaked at earlier epochs one needs to look at early - type dwarfs : des , dsphs and even transition - type dwarfs clearly underwent their major activity around or beyond 10 gyr ago .",

    "homogeneous data sets and analyses are valuable to obtain a uniform overview of the properties of the different galaxies in the lg .",
    "in galaxies beyond the lg , distance makes crowding more severe , and even hst can not resolve stars as faint as the msto of old populations .",
    "the higher the distance , the worse the crowding conditions , and the shorter the lookback time @xmath0 reachable even with the deepest , highest resolution photometry . depending on distance and intrinsic crowding , the reachable @xmath0 in galaxies more than 1",
    "mpc away ranges from several gyrs ( in the best cases , when the rgb or even the hb are clearly identified ) , to several hundreds myr ( when agb stars are recognized ) , to a few tens myr ( when only the brightest supergiants are resolved ) .",
    "the effect of distance on the possibility of resolving individual stars , and therefore on the reachable @xmath0 , is shown in fig.[dist ] , where the cmds obtained from wfpc2 photometry of three late - type galaxies are shown : the lmc bar ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* smecker - hane et al .",

    "* aloisi et al . ( 2007 ) ) .",
    "notice that the latter modulus is inferred from the periods and luminosities of a few classical cepheids measured from hst / acs data which also allowed us to reach the rgb , but the wfpc2 data shown in fig.[dist ] allow to reach only the agb .",
    "the cmd obtained from the acs is shown in fig.[izw18_acs ] .",
    "since the local group does nt host all types of galaxies , with the notable and unfortunate absence of both the most and the least evolved ones ( ellipticals and blue compact dwarfs , bcds , respectively ) , a few people have tackled the challenging task of deriving the sfh of more distant galaxies . in spite of the larger uncertainties and the shorter lookback time , these studies have led to quite interesting results , which would nt have been possible without hst .",
    "first of all , all the galaxies , including bcds , where individual stars have been resolved by hst , and the sfh has been derived with the synthetic cmd method , have turned out to be already active at the lookback time reached by the photometry ( see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",

    "the lookback time is indicated and in all cases stars with that age were detected .",
    "all the late - type dwarfs of fig.[sfall ] present a recent sf burst , which is what let people discover them in spite of the distance , and none of them exhibits long quiescent phases within the reached @xmath0 .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the sfh of the low surface brightness dwarf ugc  5889 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* vallenari et al . 2005 ) ) is also qualitatively similar to that of starburst dwarfs , except that the sfr is definitely moderate . in all the shown galaxies",
    "the strongest sf episodes are overimposed over a rather continuous , moderate sf , already in place at the @xmath0 reached by the photometry .",
    "indeed , no one has ever found yet a galaxy without stars as old as @xmath0 from the cmds of the resolved populations .",
    "the sf rate differs significantly from one galaxy to the other .",
    "the two most powerful bursts measured so far are the recent ones in ngc  1705 and ngc  1569 , with sfr per unit area a factor 10 - 100 higher than in the other starbursting dwarfs studied through their cmds .",
    "intriguingly , the strongest of all is not a bcd , but the dwarf irregular ngc  1569 , suggesting that the morphological classification of these faint small galaxies was possibly affected by their distance and the capability of resolving their shape with ground - based small telescopes , at the time of their discovery .",
    "had it been at 20 mpc , ngc  1569 would have probably been classified as a bcd .",
    "from the comparison of the sfhs of starburst dwarfs with those of local group dwarf irregulars , one can see that in both cases the sf regime is rather continuous ( gasping ) , with two main differences : starburst dwarfs always have the strongest sf episode at recent epochs , while the current sf activity of local irregulars is not necessarily the highest peak .",
    "leo a , with the main sf peak a few gyr ago ( fig.[leoa ] ) is quite typical . on the other hand , it is interesting to notice that the sf of the smc region around the very young cluster ngc  602 ( fig.[sfh_602 ] ) , host of hii regions , shows time distribution and current rate per unit area similar to those ( fig.[sfall ] ) of starburst dwarfs ( once called extragalactic hii regions ) .",
    "the former however involves a small area , corresponding to a tiny fraction of the smc , while the latter are global behaviours , referring to the whole galaxy .    by comparing with each other the sfhs derived from the cmds of ( few , small ) regions of the lg spirals ( fig.[spiral ] ) ,",
    "one is tempted to speculate over a possible dependence of the sfhs on their morphological type and luminosity class .",
    "m31 ( sa b i - ii ) seems to have had very continuous , almost constant sf , since the earliest epochs .",
    "the solar neighbourhood of the mw ( sab bc ii - iii ) also shows a rather continuous sf regime , but with larger differences between the rate of the sf peaks and dips , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "m33 ( sa c iii ) definitely has significant bumps and gasps over its sfh , with a distribution of sfr with time almost undistinguishable from that derived for the late - type dwarf leo a. one could then argue that the later the morphological type and the lower the luminosity class of the spirals , the more similar their sfh to those of late - type dwarfs .",
