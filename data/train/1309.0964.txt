    "the ratchet effect , i.  e. occurrence of directed transport in space - periodic systems under unbiased forcing , has become an object of extensive research in recent years .",
    "quantum ratchets realized with cold atoms in optical lattices represent a promising way for constructing new - age microscopic devices , for example , atomic chips in quantum computers . in the simplest setup for the atomic ratchet ,",
    "one uses far - detuned deep optical lattice @xcite . in this case atomic dynamics can be fairly described in the framework of the semiclassical approximation .",
    "activation of net current requires escaping of atoms from the potential wells .",
    "this process is impeded by the classical dynamical barriers in phase space .",
    "therefore , the experiments are usually conducted with relatively strong perturbation of the optical potential , when the barriers do nt survive .",
    "another approach to facilitate escaping is the usage of high - frequency driving leading to the lowering of the effective optical potential @xcite .    in the present paper",
    "we propose a simple way to generate directed atomic transport using a small - amplitude perturbation , even if atoms are initially localized near the minima of the potential .",
    "usage of a small - amplitude perturbation should be favorable because it allows one to avoid overheating of the atomic ensemble .",
    "the key idea of our approach is to combine deterministic and stochastic driving .",
    "the stochastic part is responsible for the destruction of the dynamical barriers , while the deterministic one provides controllable violation of space - time symmetries , which is necessary for production of atomic current in a desired direction .",
    "in addition , a properly constructed deterministic driving allows one to reduce the noise level needed for destruction of the dynamical barriers .",
    "the particular scheme we consider is based on the usage of two additional optical lattices whose amplitudes are subjected to broadband modulation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we describe the model considered .",
    "section [ classical ] is devoted to the properties of this model in the classical limit .",
    "quantum atomic dynamics is considered in section [ transport ] . in summary",
    ", we give a brief account of the results obtained .",
    "in the case of large detuning of the atom - field resonance and in the rotating - wave approximation , motion of a wavepacket corresponding to the two - level atom is described by the schrdinger equation @xmath0 where @xmath1 is position , @xmath2 is the atomic mass , @xmath3 is the detuning of the atom - field resonance , @xmath4 is the rabi frequency which can be expressed as @xmath5 after the transformation @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the wavenumber of the laser field , @xmath8 is the recoil frequency , we rewrite the schrdinger equation @xcite in the following form : @xmath9 where the rescaled planck constant is given by @xmath10 hereafter we shall omit the subscript at @xmath11 .    in the present work , we propose the following configuration of the optical potential : @xmath12 @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath15 is a model parameter equal to 1 or @xmath16 , and @xmath17 is a broadband signal .",
    "we model this signal as the so - called harmonic noise @xcite .",
    "harmonic noise is the two - dimensional ornstein - uhlenbeck process obeying the following coupled stochastic differential equations @xmath18 where @xmath19 is a positive constant , and @xmath20 is gaussian white noise with @xmath21 it should be emphasized that the terms @xmath17 and @xmath22 in ( [ vxt ] ) correspond to one and the same realization of harmonic noise , they differ only by the temporal shift @xmath23 .",
    "the first two moments of harmonic noise are given by @xmath24 power spectrum of the harmonic noise is described by formula @xmath25 in the present work @xmath26 is taken of 1 .",
    "then the perturbation strength is determined by the parameter @xmath27 . in the case of low values of @xmath19 ,",
    "the power spectrum has the peak at the frequency @xmath28 with the width @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "it should be mentioned that harmonic noise had been recently considered in the context of the landau - zener tunneling in optical lattices @xcite .",
    "as @xmath31 , @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is determined by initial conditions in ( [ ou2d ] ) . setting @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 one obtains @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath31 .",
    "hence , it turns out that @xmath39 for @xmath40 behaves like a plane wave with fluctuating phase and amplitude ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - v ] ) . in numerical simulation , we set @xmath41 and @xmath42 .    taking into account the periodicity of the potential @xmath43 , we use the periodic boundary conditions @xmath44 it means that we consider only the states with zero quasimomentum .",
    "this choice is reasonable as long as we consider only the semiclassical regime with fairly small values of the rescaled planck constant @xmath45 . in this case energy bands are flat and tunneling between neighboring potential wells is negligible ,",

    "trajectories of atoms obey hamiltonian equations of motion @xmath54 where the classical hamiltonian @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 time - dependent perturbation @xmath39 leads to the nonintegrability of equations ( [ sys ] ) and onset of chaos . for @xmath47 and @xmath14 ,",
    "chaotic motion occurs only inside a relatively small near - separatrix layer acting as a `` bridge '' between the domains of finite and ballistic motion . in this case",
    ", the perturbation is a plane wave of the form ( [ plane ] ) , and the equations of motion read @xmath57 one can easily ensure that both the shift symmetry @xmath58 and the time - reversal symmetry @xmath59 are broken in this case , making the onset of directed transport possible .",
    "the plane wave @xmath39 tends to carry atoms in the direction @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) for @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) , i.  e. along the lines of the of the constant phase in fig .",
    "[ fig - v ] .",
    "it results in the asymmetry of the chaotic layer in the momentum space , as it is demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - poinc ] .",
    "this asymmetry expects emergence of the nonzero ballistic flux @xcite whose direction is determined by @xmath15 .",
    "however , there is a large layer of regular motion in classical phase space , acting as a dynamical barrier for the atoms localized near the potential minima and preventing their transition into the ballistic regime .",
    "consequently , atoms with minimal initial energies can produce directed current only due to tunneling which is almost negligible in deep optical lattices .    with @xmath40 ,",
    "the perturbation contains a noisy component which causes atom diffusion through the dynamic barriers .",
    "the correlation time of the noisy component can be roughly estimated as @xmath62 , therefore , increasing of @xmath19 should anticipate enhancing of the diffusion . the noisy component does nt alter time - space symmetries , therefore , the direction of the resulting transport is still determined by @xmath15 .",
    "indeed , one can see in fig .",
    "[ fig - v ] that the constant phase lines for @xmath39 are biased in the same direction for all values of @xmath19 , despite of the gradual pattern randomization with increasing @xmath19 .",
    "it should be noted that the stable equilibrium point in the poincar plots presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - poinc ] is displaced from the origin @xmath63 .",
    "this occurs due to nonlinear resonance of multiplicity 1:1 between oscillations of the perturbation with the frequency @xmath41 , and the unperturbed oscillations in the vicinity of the original equilibrium point .",
    "as the resonance 1:1 has relatively large width in phase space , the atoms it traps can undergo large - amplitude oscillations in the energy space , remaining inside the regular domain though . if @xmath40 , the presence of such oscillations facilitates activation of atoms initially located near the center of phase space , because the resonance acts as a `` lift '' carrying atoms from the center upwards in energy , thus reducing their activation energy . in this way",
    ", @xmath41 seems to be close to the optimal choice of the driving frequency @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is well - known that the lowest - order resonances typically have the largest widths in the energy space , thereby providing the most efficient excitation .",
    "let s proceed with considering quantum evolution by solving numerically the schrdinger equation ( [ shrod ] ) . given a realization of the modulation @xmath17",
    ", one can calculate the asymptotic current defined as @xcite @xmath64 where @xmath65 is quantum - mechanical momentum expectation value @xmath66 averaging over realizations of @xmath17 , we obtain the statistical mean of the asymptotic current @xmath67 where integer @xmath68 labels the realizations .",
    "our computations were performed with @xmath69 . as long as we consider the case of a deep optical lattice ,",
    "the rescaled planck constant @xmath45 was taken of 0.1 .",
    "initial state used is a random superposition of coherent states : @xmath70 where @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 is random quantities obeying the gaussian statistics with zero mean and variance 0.25 .",
    "this initial condition corresponds to a wavepacket tightly localized near the stable equilibrium point of the unperturbed system @xmath75 , @xmath53 .",
    "( solid ) and @xmath51 ( dashes ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath76 . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    figure [ fig - fluxes ] represents time dependence of the ensemble - averaged current for @xmath76 .",
    "one can see that the ballistic current is activated only beyond some time threshold which is needed to atoms to gain enough energy for escaping .",
    "below this threshold , @xmath77 undergoes the oscillations associated with atomic motion inside the potential wells .",
    "notably , the curves corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath51 are nearly symmetric with respect to the semiaxis @xmath78 .",
    "it means that the current direction is readily controlled by the sign of @xmath15 .     on @xmath19 .",
    ", scaledwidth=40.0% ]    it is reasonable to examine how current varies with increasing of the noise contribution which can be quantified by @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , small noise contribution anticipates weak diffusion and slow crossing of the dynamic barriers in phase space . on the other hand",
    ", large amount of noise should destroy the plane - wave form of the perturbation due to the loss of coherence between the modulating signals @xmath17 and @xmath22 .",
    "as long as the plane - wave form is responsible for violation of space - time symmetries , resulting transport should become undirected .",
    "consequently , there should be some intermediate range of @xmath19 values corresponding to the most efficient activation of directed current . to find it , we consider finite time interval @xmath79 $ ] and calculate the dependence of the mean asymptotic current at the endpoint of the interval on @xmath19 .",
    "the result computed with @xmath51 is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig - flux_g ] . according to above expectations ,",
    "the dependence of @xmath80 on @xmath19 is not monotonic , and the most efficient generation of ballistic current corresponds to @xmath81 .",
    "it should be mentioned that directed transport is almost absent in the purely deterministic case @xmath47 .",
    "it unambiguously indicates on the importance of noise in the activation of ballistic atomic current .",
    "vs @xmath19 . , scaledwidth=40.0% ]    to underline the link between the onset of directed current and heating of atoms , we calculate the mean energy determined as @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the hamiltonian operator corresponding to the @xmath68-th realization of perturbation @xmath39 .",
    "dependence of @xmath84 on @xmath19 , demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ fig - en_g ] , reveals that the range of the @xmath19 values corresponding to the most efficient current generation , @xmath85 , simultaneously corresponds to the most efficient heating .",
    "non - monotonous dependence on the noise level indicates on the significance of factors of heating , which are not concerned with noise . in our case , the role of such factor",
    "is played by classical resonance 1:1 whose impact decreases as @xmath19 grows .",
    "thus , the optimal activation occurs when resonance - assisted and diffusive mechanisms of atom heating accompany each other constructively .",
    "it should be noted that decreasing of @xmath86 for @xmath87 is significantly slower than the corresponding decreasing of @xmath88 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - flux_g ] ) .",
    "this can be understood as noise - induced recovery of space - time symmetries due to loss of correlations between harmonic noise values @xmath17 and @xmath22 .",
    "we presented a novel approach to produce directed atomic current in an optical lattice by means of weak unbiased perturbation consisted of two lattices with broadband amplitude modulation . in this work we model the broadband modulation as harmonic noise .",
    "the approach presented allows for the current generation even if atoms are tightly confined by the lattice potential at the initial moment .",
    "it is shown that the efficiency of generation depends non - monotonously on the parameter describing the spectral width of the perturbation .",
    "we suppose that the approach reported can be used for production of directed current in a more complicated configurations of the optical potential , for example , in potentials with random disorder .",
