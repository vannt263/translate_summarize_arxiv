    "to elucidate the nature of random spin systems , especially spin glass systems , has been a subject of a long - standing interest[1 - 21 ] . in the random spin systems ,",
    "when we take one sample , namely , one bond configuration , the local energies of interacting bonds take various values , which change as the sample changes .",
    "there have been many works about the energy of spin glass systems , for example , about the ground state energy[7 - 9 ] , energy barrier[10 - 12 ] , energy landscape [ 13 - 15 ] , low - energy excitation[16,17 ] for various spin glass systems .",
    "on the other hand , nishimori[18 ] derived several rigorous results at a special line in the phase diagram of spin glass systems , which has now been called `` nishimori - line '' .",
    "the results were derived mainly by the use of the local gauge transformation , so that they hold for various spin glass models on any lattice in any dimension .",
    "the exact internal energy and the upper bound of the specific heat at nishimori - line were derived . moreover , a nature of the correlation function was derived , from which it follows that the ferromagnetic order parameter and the spin glass order parameter coincide with each other at nisimori - line , and the ferromagnetic phase boundary has some restriction in the phase diagram[18 - 20 ] .",
    "furthermore , it was derived that the correlation - function distribution function must satisfy a certain relation at nishimori - line[21 ] .    in this paper , we investigate the nature of the probability distribution function of the local energy in the @xmath0 ising model .",
    "it has been derived that , at finite temperature , the probability distribution function mentioned above must satisfy several relations at @xmath1 and at nishimori - line , respectively , on any lattice in any dimension .",
    "they relate the probability distribution function corresponding to the local energy lower than @xmath3 with that corresponding to the local enegy greater than @xmath3 .",
    "the present results at nishimori - line are , in a sense , generalization of nishimori s result about the internal energy[18 ] , since the probability distribution function has more information than only the average value .",
    "moreover , we have numerically calculated the probability distribution functions of the local energy at @xmath1 and at nishimori - line in the two - dimensional @xmath0 ising model , from which we have found that , in a certain temperature region , they have several peaks which are related to the patterns of frustration around a bond of the lattice .",
    "we consider the @xmath0 ising model , where the dimension of the lattice , the lattice structure and the range of the interactions may be arbitrary .",
    "the hamiltonian is written as follows : @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and the summation of @xmath7 runs over all the interacting pairs .",
    "each @xmath8 is determined according to the following probability distribution : @xmath9 in this paper , we put that @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( @xmath12 is the boltzmann constant ) .",
    "now , we denote the local energy of the interacting bond @xmath7 in a given bond configuration , @xmath13 , as @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the thermal average at temperature , @xmath17 .",
    "then , the probability distribution function of the local energy , @xmath18 , can be written as @xmath19_{k_{p}},\\ ] ] where @xmath20_{k_{p}}$ ] denotes the configurational average at the ferromagnetic bond concentration , @xmath2 .",
    "( we define @xmath21 as @xmath22 . ) in this paper , we do not investigate the nature of @xmath18 directly , but investigate that of a slightly different form , namely , @xmath23_{k_{p}},\\ ] ] which is related to @xmath18 as @xmath24 here , it is noted that @xmath18 may take non - zero value in the region , @xmath25 , so that @xmath26 may take non - zero value in the region , @xmath27 .",
    "in this section , we investigate the nature of the probabilty distribution function of the local energy , @xmath26 , at @xmath1 and at nishimori - line , respectively .",
    "firstly , we can derive the following identity : @xmath28_{k_{p}}. } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] ( for the detailed derivation of equation ( 7 ) , see the appendix . )",
    "next , we integrate both terms of equation ( 7 ) from @xmath29 to @xmath30 ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 are arbitrary real numbers , which satisfy @xmath31 . ) : namely , @xmath32_{k_{p}}dx } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn { = \\int_{1/b}^{1/a } [ ( \\cosh(2k_{p})+\\sinh(2k_{p})e_{ij}(k_{p } ) ) \\delta ( \\frac { 1}{x}-\\frac { 1}{\\cosh(2k)+\\sinh(2k)e_{ij}(k)}]_{k_{p } } \\frac { dx}{x^{2 } } } \\nonumber \\\\ { = \\int_{1/b}^{1/a } [ ( \\cosh(2k_{p})+\\sinh(2k_{p})e_{ij}(k_{p } ) ) \\delta ( x-(\\cosh(2k)+\\sinh(2k)e_{ij}(k))]_{k_{p}}dx , } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the following property of @xmath33-function to derive the last term : @xmath34 equation ( 8) is the basic identity , which we use to derive the properties of the probability distribution function of the local energy .    first , we investigate the case , @xmath1 . at @xmath1 , @xmath35 , so that equation ( 8) becomes @xmath36_{0}dx } \\nonumber \\\\ = \\int_{1/b}^{1/a } p_{e}^{(2)}(x , k,0)dx\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] changing the variable @xmath37 into @xmath38 of rhs of equation ( 10 ) , we also obtain @xmath39 for investigating the direct form of @xmath26 , we define the following averaged distribution function , @xmath40 : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is an arbitrary finite value which satisfies @xmath43 . then , equation ( 11 ) can be written as : @xmath44 we can take the value , @xmath42 , as an arbitrarily small but finite value . in this sense",
    ", we can conclude that the value of @xmath45 coincides with that of @xmath46 at any finite temperature .",
    "equations ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) are the main results at @xmath1 . in a word , these equations are the conditions which relates the value of the probability distribution function at @xmath37 with that at @xmath47 . as the temperature changes , the distribution function of the local energy itself may change , however , the distribution function must satisfy the above relations at any finite temperature on any lattice in any dimension . using @xmath18 , equation ( 13 )",
    "is written by the following form : @xmath48 which becomes a rather complicated form , from which , however , we can see that equation ( 14 ) is a condition which relates the probability distribution function corresponding to the local energy lower than @xmath3 with that corresponding to the local energy greater than @xmath3 .",
    "next , we investigate the nature of the probability distribution function of the local energy at nishimori - line . at nishimori - line ,",
    "@xmath49 , so that equation ( 8) becomes @xmath50_{k}dx } \\nonumber \\\\",

    "in this section , we derive several properties of the local energy at @xmath1 and at nishimori - line , using the results of the preceding section .    for the configurational average of the local energy at nishimori - line , from equation ( 15 ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath53_{k } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn { = \\int_{\\exp(-2k)}^{\\exp(2k)}xp_{e}^{(2)}(x , k , k)dx } \\nonumber \\\\ = \\int_{\\exp(-2k)}^{\\exp(2k)}p_{e}^{(2)}(x , k , k)dx=1,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which , it is easily calculated that @xmath54_{k}=-\\tanh ( k),\\ ] ] which was first derived by nishimori[18 ] . at @xmath1 , by the similar procedure , it can be derived that @xmath54_{0 } \\geq -\\tanh ( k).\\ ] ]    next , putting @xmath55 and @xmath56 in equation ( 10 ) at @xmath1 , we obtain @xmath57 using @xmath18 , equation ( 21 ) can be written as @xmath58 on the other hand , at nishimori - line , from equation ( 15 ) , we obtain @xmath59    the above results are intersting , since , at nishimori - line , the configurational average of the local energy coincides with @xmath3 at any temperature , while , at @xmath1 , the probability that the local energy , @xmath14 , takes the value smaller than @xmath3 always coincides with one that @xmath14 takes the value larger than @xmath3 at any temperature . furthermore , these results hold on any lattice structure in any dimension .",
    "now , we show the examples how the above feature holds in the two - dimensional square - lattice @xmath0 ising model with only nearest neighbour interactions . by the transfer matrix method , we have calculated the values of @xmath14 in @xmath60 lattice ( @xmath61 ) for @xmath62 bond configurations , from which we have estimated @xmath63 at @xmath1 and at nishimori - line for @xmath64 . figures 1 and 2 are the results of the above procedure at @xmath65 at @xmath1 and at nisimori - line , respectively .",
    "we have confirmed that equations ( 13 ) and ( 17 ) definitely hold within the statistical errors .    in the figures",
    ", we can see that the averaged probability distribution function , @xmath63 , has three peaks at @xmath1 , and one peak and two shoulders at nishimori - line .",
    "in the two - dimensional square lattice @xmath0 ising model , the number of the patterns of furstration of two plaquettes around a certain bond of the lattice is three if we take into account only the number of frustration plaquettes , and each bond configuration belongs to one of the three patterns .",
    "we have confirmed that each peak or shoulder corresponds to the contribution from one of the three patterns of frustration .",
    "as the temperature decreases , each peak broadens , and at sufficient low temperature , it is found that @xmath63 has only one peak .",
    "more detailed numerical properties of the probability distribution function of the local energy is reported in a separated paper in the future .",
    "we have investigated the nature of the probability distribution function of the local energy in ising spin glass .",
    "we have derived that , in the @xmath0 ising model , the probability distribution function , @xmath66 , must satisfy several relations at finite temperature on any lattice in any dimension at @xmath1 and at nishimori - line , respectively .",
    "they relate the probability distribution function corresponding to the local energy lower than @xmath3 with that corresponding to the local enegy greater than @xmath3 .",
    "the present results at nishimori - line are generalization of nishimori s result[18 ] about the internal energy , since the probability distribution function has more information than only the average value .",
    "moreover , from the numerical calculation , we have found that , in a certain temperature region , the probability distribution function of the local enargy has several peaks which are related to the patterns of frustration around a certain bond in the lattice .",
    "more detailed numerical properties are reported in the near future .",
    "the authors would thank dr .",
    "s. kobayashi and dr .",
    "s. hara for fruiful discussions .",
    "the calculations were made on hitac sr8000 and sr11000 at the institue for solid state physics in university of tokyo and at university of tokyo .",
    "in this appendix , we briefly explain the derivation of equation ( 7 ) .",
    "first , we denote the partition function of the system in a given bond configuration , @xmath13 as ; @xmath67 where we denote the temperature at bond @xmath7 separately .",
    "also , we introduce the notation,@xmath68_{k_{p},k_{p}^{'}}$ ] : @xmath69_{k_{p},k_{p}^ { ' } } } \\nonumber \\\\ = \\frac { 1}{(2\\cosh ( k_{p}))^{n_{\\rm b}-1}2\\cosh ( k_{p}^{'})}\\sum_{\\{\\tau\\ } } \\exp({k_{p } \\sum_{lm\\ne ij}\\tau_{lm}+k_{p}^{'}\\tau_{ij}})\\cdots,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 is the numbers of bonds , and we denote the ferromagnetic bond concentration of bond @xmath7 separately . of course ,",
    "if @xmath71 , the notation mentioned above coincides with the standard one : @xmath72_{k_{p},k_{p } } = [ \\cdots]_{k_{p}}.\\ ] ]    it is easily obtained that @xmath73 then , it yields that @xmath74_{k_{p } } } \\nonumber \\\\ = [ \\delta(x-\\frac { z(k ,- k)}{z(k , k)})]_{k_{p},k_{p}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the last term of the above equation is invariant when we change the sign of @xmath4 and @xmath21 at bond @xmath7 simultaneously , since it means that we just take the summation of @xmath75 reversely ; namely , @xmath76_{k_{p},-k_{p } } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn { = [ \\exp(-2k_{p}\\tau_{ij})\\delta(x-\\frac { 1}{\\frac { z(k ,- k)}{z(k , k)}})]_{k_{p},k_{p } } } \\nonumber \\\\ \\lefteqn { = [ ( \\cosh(2k_{p})-\\sinh(2k_{p})\\tau_{ij } ) \\delta(x-\\frac { 1}{\\cosh(2k)+\\sinh(2k)e_{ij}(k)})]_{k_{p } } } \\nonumber \\\\ { = [ ( \\cosh(2k_{p})+\\sinh(2k_{p})e_{ij}(k ) ) \\delta(x-\\frac { 1}{\\cosh(2k)+\\sinh(2k)e_{ij}(k)})]_{k_{p } } , } \\nonumber \\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use the local gauge transformation to derive the last term .",
