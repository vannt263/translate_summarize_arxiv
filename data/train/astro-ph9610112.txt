    "possibly no elliptical galaxy has been as thoroughly studied as m87 ( ngc 4486 ) in the virgo cluster .",
    "early observations of the core of m87 revealed a velocity dispersion profile that rose toward the center , a feature that was initially attributed to the presence of a massive ( @xmath4 ) black hole ( sargent et al .",
    "the same data were soon interpreted in other ways ; for instance , @xcite demonstrated that models without a central point mass were equally acceptable if one was willing to let the stellar velocity ellipsoid become strongly prolate at @xmath5 pc from the center .",
    "such extreme models were later shown to be dynamically unstable ( merritt 1987 ) , but the instability led only to the formation of a mildly elongated bar , which  if viewed from a line - of - sight not far from its major axis  yielded nearly the same dependence of velocity dispersion on radius as the anisotropic spherical model .",
    "the most recent , stellar kinematical data ( dressler & richstone 1990 ; jarvis & peletier 1991 ; van der marel 1994 ) reveal that the velocity dispersion fails to rise within the inner few arc seconds of m87 .",
    "these data require even less anisotropy than the earlier , black - hole - free models .",
    "in fact , as emphasized by @xcite , a @xmath6 black hole can only be reconciled with the velocity dispersion data if one assumes that the stellar motions near the center of m87 are nearly _ circular _ , a configuration that they found implausible .",
    "the stellar dynamical data thus seem to provide little if any evidence for a dark central mass .    the case for a massive black hole in m87",
    "is nevertheless quite strong . @xcite and @xcite discovered a rapidly - rotating , ionized gas disk within the inner arc second of m87 , with a major axis roughly perpendicular to the m87 jet . at a radius of @xmath7 pc along the major axis of the disk , the spectra show emission lines separated by @xmath8 km s@xmath9 . if this gas is in approximately circular motion , and if the disk is inclined at @xmath10 as implied by the apparent axial ratio , then m87 contains a central dark mass of @xmath11 ( harms et al .",
    "1994 ) . more recent hst observations at higher spatial resolution ( ford et al . 1996 ) appear to confirm this result .    a nuclear black hole with this mass",
    "would be expected to affect the stellar motions within a radius @xmath12 in m87 , where @xmath13 km s@xmath9 is the stellar velocity dispersion .",
    "( we assume throughout a distance to m87 of 16 mpc ; thus @xmath14 corresponds to @xmath15 pc .",
    ") however no increase in the stellar velocities is seen in the inner few arc seconds ; in fact the best ground - based data suggest a slight _ decrease _ in the velocity dispersion inside @xmath3 ( e.g. fig",
    ". 1 of jarvis & peletier 1991 ) .    these apparently contradictory data can be reconciled if the stellar motions are appreciably circular within the radius of influence of the black hole .",
    "such a model will not keep the observed velocity dispersions low at arbitrarily small radii ",
    "orbital velocities sufficiently close to the black hole must eventually rise according to kepler s law  but a local bias toward circular motions at @xmath16 can reduce the line - of - sight dispersions at @xmath17 by an amount that is sufficient to reproduce the stellar velocity dispersion measurements ( dressler & richstone 1990 ) . it is interesting that a number of models for the formation of massive black holes predict anisotropy in the stellar motions at radii close to @xmath18 . for instance , the adiabatic growth of a black hole in a pre - existing galaxy core always produces a slight enhancement of circular motions at the expense of radial ones ( goodman & binney 1984 ) . an even stronger effect may be predicted by models in which black holes form by the coalescence of smaller black holes ( ebisuzaki , makino & okumura 1991 ) ; here the anisotropy results from the ejection of stars on elongated orbits due to three - body scattering by the black hole binary ( quinlan 1996 ) .    in the present paper , we re - analyze the @xcite velocity dispersion data , assuming the presence of a nuclear black hole with the mass quoted by @xcite .",
    "we make use of the fact that  in a spherical system with a known gravitational potential ",
    "the shape of the stellar velocity ellipsoid at every radius follows uniquely from the observed velocity dispersion profile ( binney & mamon 1982 ) . in the case of m87",
    ", the stellar @xmath19 ( e. g. richstone & tremaine 1985 ) implies that the black hole dominates the gravitational force out to a radius of @xmath20 pc @xmath21 .",
    "the stars also contribute to the gravitational force , of course , but their contribution can be reasonably approximated by assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio ; @xmath19 can then be derived from the virial theorem independent of any assumptions about the velocity anisotropy .",
    "such a model is likely to be only approximately correct at large radii , where the dark matter surrounding m87 begins to affect the gravitational potential .",
    "but it is probably an excellent approximation at small radii where the influence of the black hole on the motions of the stars is significant .",
    "the same conceptual model has been used in many previous studies of the stellar dynamics of m87 .",
    "our treatment is new , however , in two ways .",
    "first , ours is the first study to to make use of the black hole mass as determined by harms et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and ford et al .",
    "thus we are able to specify a definite value for @xmath22 ( although we consider also the effect of varying @xmath22 by its estimated uncertainty ) .",
    "second , our treatment of the data is more sophisticated than in previous studies . since the dependence of the velocity anisotropy on radius , @xmath23 ,",
    "is not known a priori , the goal should be to generate an estimate of this function directly from the data .",
    "in other words , one should approach the estimation of @xmath24 as an inverse problem , not as a model - fitting problem .",
    "@xcite attempted to infer @xmath24 directly from the data that were available at the time , but they chose to represent the velocity dispersion profile using an ad - hoc set of template curves , thus weakening the model - independence of their results .",
    "binney & mamon also did not take into account the possible effects of seeing and instrumental blurring on the velocity dispersion data .",
    "van der marel ( 1994 ) took the opposite , `` model - fitting '' approach , assuming a parametrized functional form for @xmath24 and then predicting how a given model would appear after projection into observable space .",
    "however he did not consider any functional forms for @xmath24 in which the stellar motions were circularly biased at small radii , as predicted by the black - hole formation models discussed above .",
    "the algorithm presented here combines the best features of both these studies .",
    "we ask simply : what smooth functions @xmath24 are consistent with the measured set of velocity dispersions ?",
    "this is an ill - posed problem , since many functional forms for @xmath24 are likely to be consistent with the data after projection through the galaxy and after blurring by the atmosphere and the detector .",
    "we accordingly use a regularized algorithm to find the `` most likely '' expression for @xmath24 .",
    "the uncertainty in our estimate is itself estimated via a standard bootstrap algorithm ; the ill - conditioning of the inverse problem manisfests itself most strongly as a widening of the confidence bands at small and large radii , where the data do not strongly constrain the solutions . at no point",
    "do we make any assumptions about the functional forms of the observed profiles or of @xmath24 , except insofar as we require these functions to be continuous and smooth .",
    "thus we achieve the model - independence aspired to by @xcite , while fully accounting for observational degradation of the data as in @xcite .",
    "we find that a black hole with the mass determined by @xcite and @xcite implies a substantial change in the shapes of the stellar orbits near the center of m87 . in order to reproduce the low , central value of the velocity dispersion ,",
    "the stellar orbits must become appreciably circular within the radius of influence of the black hole .",
    "the statistical significance of this result depends somewhat on the exact value assigned to @xmath22 ; the larger @xmath22 , the greater the tangential anisotropy implied by the velocity dispersion data . such a result  although superficially implausible for a hot stellar system  deserves to be taken seriously in the light of black - hole formation models that predict a circular bias in the stellar orbits at @xmath25 .",
    "the data , none of which are new , are summarized in  2 . the nonparametric algorithm used to correct the velocity dispersion data for seeing and for instrumental blurring is presented in  3 .",
    "the derivation of @xmath24 is the subject of  4 , and in  5 we interpret our results in the light of recent models for the formation of nuclear black holes .",
    "only two observational quantities are needed for this study : the surface brightness profile of the starlight in m87 , @xmath26 ; and the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile of the stars , @xmath27 .",
    "( we assume throughout that m87 is spherically symmetric . )",
    "the published sources from which our data were derived are as follows .",
    "hst i - band photometry of m87 for @xmath28 were presented by @xcite .",
    "these data have an estimated spatial resolution of @xmath29 . between @xmath30 and @xmath31 , ground - based , @xmath32 band photometry of m87 was published by @xcite .",
    "we converted the latter data to i - band via @xmath33 , the average color at these radii .",
    "the surface brightnesses were then corrected for galactic extinction using @xmath34 ( van der marel 1994 ) .",
    "our velocity dispersion data were taken from @xcite , who used the 4.2 m william herschel telescope in subarsecond seeing to obtain high s / n spectra of m87 within @xmath35 .",
    "we followed van der marel s practice of using only the g - band data presented in his table c1 .",
    "measurements of @xmath36 at positive and negative radii were averaged and their quoted errors reduced using standard formulae for error propagation .",
    "these data are presented in fig . 1 .",
    "the data consist of a set of measurements @xmath37 at discrete positions @xmath38 and their estimated errors @xmath39 . our goal is to extract smooth representations of functions like @xmath24 from these ( noisy and incomplete ) data .",
    "the relation between the data and the unknown function ( call it @xmath40 ) has the implicit form @xmath41 where @xmath42 is a linear operator relating @xmath40 to measured quantities at @xmath43 , and @xmath44 represents scatter of the data around their mean value at @xmath38 , due in part to measurement errors .    the operator @xmath45 contains contributions from two sorts of effects : data degradation due to instrumental limitations , seeing , binning , etc ; and projection of the intrinsic function @xmath40 into observable space  for instance , projection onto the plane of the sky .",
    "to the extent that both effects are understood , at least in a statistical sense , we can write an expression for @xmath45 and apply regularized inversion algorithms to solve for the most likely @xmath40 ( merritt 1993a ) . confidence bands on the function estimates can then be computed via the bootstrap ( efron 1982 ) .",
    "the regularization is necessary since the inverse operation @xmath46 is typically ill - conditioned ( osullivan 1986 ) , so that direct inversion of the data would produce unacceptably noisy results .    rather than derive a single expression for @xmath45 that includes all of the relevant effects",
    ", we chose first to correct the data for seeing and instrumental blurring , and then to operate directly on the resulting smooth profiles via the inverse operator @xmath46 that represents spatial deprojection alone .",
    "this two - step procedure is perfectly justified from a statistical point of view ( e.g. wahba 1990 , p. 19 ) and has the advantage that it allows us to separate the effects of instrumental blurring from the effects of spatial deprojection .",
    "the spatial resolution of the @xcite hst surface photometry , @xmath47 , is much greater than that of the velocity dispersion observations in the region @xmath28 where the two data sets overlap .",
    "we can therefore ignore instrumental blurring in our estimate of the stellar luminosity density profile @xmath48 .",
    "we derived a nonparametric estimate of @xmath26 by fitting a smoothing spline ( wahba 1990 ) to the logarithms of the photometric data , @xmath49 vs. @xmath50 .",
    "the smoothing parameter was chosen by generalized cross - validation ( wahba 1990 , p. 52 ) .",
    "this estimate was then substituted into abel s equation , @xmath51 to yield an estimate of @xmath48 .",
    "the result was found to be almost indistinguishable from the profile displayed by van der marel ( 1994 , fig .",
    "8) , who used the same photometric data as us .",
    "we therefore do not reproduce our estimate of @xmath48 here .",
    "we note in passing that m87  although still often described as having a `` core '' ( e.g. kormendy & richstone 1995 )  in fact has a luminosity density profile that increases as a nearly - perfect power law at small radii , @xmath52 , @xmath53 pc .",
    "this profile appears superficially core - like since an @xmath54 density profile produces only a logarithmic divergence when seen in projection .    in the case of the velocity dispersion measurements , which were made from the ground , the observed values",
    "might be strongly affected near the galaxy center by atmospheric seeing and by the finite spatial resolution of the detector . here",
    "we generate , from the observed velocity dispersions @xmath55 , an estimate of the true velocity dispersion profile @xmath27 that would have been observed using a perfect detector in the absence of atmospheric blurring .",

    "these values were taken from tables 1 and c1 of @xcite ; beyond @xmath67 from the center , data from more than one pixel were binned together , making @xmath68 a function of position .",

    "we estimated the optimal @xmath85 by eye .",
    "appreciably smaller values led to estimates that seemed unphysically noisy , while much larger values biased the solution toward the infinitely smooth , exponential dependence .",
    "for a fairly wide range of @xmath85 s around our adopted value , however , there was no significant variation in the form of the estimated function .",

    "the deblurring algorithm just defined was used to estimate @xmath27 . the distribution of bootstrap estimates at every @xmath93",

    "1 follows the raw data outside of @xmath17 . at smaller radii ,",
    "the corrected profile rises slightly above the mean relation defined by the measured values .",
    "we would not expect the corrected profile to deviate strongly from the raw data even at these small radii , since the observed velocity dispersions are approximately constant within the inner two arc seconds , and a flat profile remains flat after deblurring .",
    "however , the bootstrap confidence bands suggest that quite a wide range of profile shapes are consistent with the data inside of @xmath94 , from a flat or inwardly decreasing profile , to one that increases as far as @xmath95 km s@xmath9 at @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "we note that the widening of the confidence bands at small radii is due primarily to the amplification of errors that accompanies the deconvolution ; the measurement errors quoted by @xcite are almost independent of radius , but their consequences become greater near the center due to the increased importance of the seeing and instrumental corrections there .    the flatness of the velocity dispersion profile very near the center of m87 was noted by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite in their respective data sets .",
    "this result appears therefore to be robust , although it could of course reflect some systematic error in the interpretation of the data .",

    "in a nonrotating , spherical stellar system , the dependence of the velocity anisotropy @xmath99 on radius can be inferred uniquely from the observed velocity dispersion profile @xmath27 , if one is willing to assume that the functional form of the gravitational potential is known ( binney & mamon 1982 ) .",

    "the stellar velocity ellipsoid is radially elongated everywhere in this case , although the 95% confidence bands are consistent with motions that are close to isotropic .",
    "the need for radially - biased motions when the black hole mass is small or zero has been noted by a number of authors including @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "however when @xmath101 is increased to its preferred value of @xmath124 , @xmath24 is forced to decline at small radii in order to maintain the observed , low value of the central velocity dispersion .",
    "the central decline in @xmath24 becomes even more extreme if @xmath101 is increased to @xmath125  in this case , the inferred value of @xmath126 actually falls below zero inside of @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "a similar conclusion was reached by @xcite , who used an orbit - based code to infer the stellar kinematics in m87 assuming @xmath128 .    although our best estimates of @xmath24 suggest a rapidly increasing anisotropy at small radii , the confidence bands on @xmath129 become very wide at small @xmath130 , and it is not obvious from fig .",
    "2 whether the central decline in @xmath129 that we find using the two larger values of @xmath101 is statistically significant . one way to address this question is to ask : what fraction of the bootstrap estimates have a lower value of @xmath129 at @xmath131 ( say ) than at @xmath132 ?",
    "we find that the decrease in @xmath129 between @xmath132 and @xmath131 is significant at the @xmath133 level for @xmath134 and @xmath125 , and at the @xmath135 level for @xmath136 .",
    "if @xcite are correct in speculating that turbulent motions in the m87 gas disk might imply an even larger mass than @xmath125 , the central decline in @xmath24 would become even more significant .",
    "our conclusion that @xmath2 is approximately equal to , or slightly greater than , @xmath1 throughout the main body of m87 is unremarkable . however",
    "the apparent predominance of circular over radial motions at the very center of m87 is potentially more interesting .",
    "a number of models for the formation of nuclear black holes predict a bias toward circular motions within the radius of influence of the black hole , @xmath137 , or @xmath17 in m87 .",
    "this is roughly the radius at which we find that @xmath2 must fall below @xmath1 when @xmath138 .",
    "( as often noted , @xmath139 in m87 is also roughly equal to the size of the seeing disk , a coincidence that is hopefully fortuitous ! )",
    "thus it seems appropriate to ask whether the anisotropy that we infer in the stellar motions could be a relic of the black hole formation process .    in one widely - discussed class of models ,",
    "black holes grow from the accumulation of gas on a timescale long enough that the stellar action variables are adiabatically conserved .",
    "the gradual deepening of the gravitational potential in these models can induce a tangential anisotropy in the stellar motions at radii near @xmath139 . @xcite",
    "first noticed this effect in numerical calculations , and @xcite showed that the adiabatic growth of a black hole at the center of an initially isothermal galaxy always enhances the tangential components of the velocity dispersion at the expense of the radial component .",
    "however the effect is subtle , since the eccentricities of orbits in axisymmetric systems are almost unaffected by slow changes in the potential ( lynden - bell 1963 ) .",
    "@xcite followed the adiabatic growth of black holes in a variety of spherical , initially isotropic galaxy models , with and without constant - density cores .",
    "the resulting @xmath24 profiles varied from model to model , but the value of @xmath129 at @xmath140 was always close to its minimum , with @xmath141 typically lying between @xmath142 and @xmath143 .",
    "such mild anisotropies would be almost undetectable in m87 given the quality of data currently available .",
    "black holes might also grow by the capture of stars on low angular momentum orbits , whose pericenters lie within the tidal breakup radius @xmath144 of the black hole ( hills 1975 ) .",
    "one result would be to remove elongated orbits from the central regions of the galaxy and hence to increase the ratio of @xmath1 to @xmath2 ( e.g. cohn & kulsrud 1978 , fig .",
    ". however the tidal radius of a @xmath145 black hole is comparable to its schwarzschild radius , or @xmath146 pc in the case of the m87 black hole ",
    "much too small to be observed .",
    "scattering of stars at larger radii into the loss cone ( frank & rees 1976 ) would be unimportant due to the long relaxation time in m87 .    in yet another class of models ,",
    "nuclear black holes grow through the accretion of other black holes acquired from galaxy mergers ( e.g. ebisuzaki , makino & okumura 1991 ) .",
    "dynamical friction drags the black holes into the central region where they form a bound pair .",
    "the subsequent evolution was outlined by @xcite : the binary separation shrinks with time  at first through dynamical friction , later because of three - body scattering processes in which the hard binary ejects stars from the center  until it becomes small enough that gravitational radiation causes the black holes to merge . the mass of stars ejected by the binary can be comparable to the sum of the two black hole masses ( quinlan 1996 ) . because the binary interacts most strongly with stars on elongated orbits , three - body scattering should introduce a tangential bias in the velocity distribution of the remaining stars .",
    "detailed simulations of this complicated process have yet to be published , but it seems plausible that the induced anisotropy could be much greater than in the adiabatic - growth or tidal - disruption models .",
    "although our conclusions about the stellar dynamics of m87 are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of all these models , we stress that the case for a massive black hole is not strengthened in any way by our work .",
    "the low , central value of the stellar velocity dispersion in m87 continues to be surprising given the independent evidence for a dark mass .",
    "if a massive black hole is indeed present in m87 , then nature has somehow conspired to hide its effects on the stellar kinematics by adjusting the shapes of the stellar orbits . as discussed above ,",
    "such a conspiracy is not impossible to imagine , but one would still like to find evidence in the stellar kinematics for the central singularity .",
    "the bias toward circular orbits that we infer at @xmath17 is not sufficient to keep the observed dispersions low at arbitrarily small radii ; eventually , even exactly circular motions would be expected to show a keplerian rise .",
    "observations of m87 with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( baum et al .",
    "1996 ) should allow accurate measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion at a radius of @xmath147 pc , where the orbital velocity around a @xmath124 black hole would be @xmath148 km s@xmath9 .",
    "such high velocities would leave their mark on the line - of - sight velocity dispersion profile regardless of the shapes of the stellar orbits .",
    "we thank r. van der marel for assisting in the data interpretation , and g. quinlan for helping us to understand the various models for black hole formation .",
