    "this short paper examines the work of chandrasekhar @xcite on the escape of brownian particles over potential barriers . it is part of a classic paper that examines a number of stochastic problems using the fokker - planck equation for brownian particles .",
    "one of the most important results of his study has been to show under what conditions the fokker - planck equation transforms into an advection - gradient diffusion equation commonly referred to as smoluchowski s equation .",
    "this has a significant bearing on the formula for the release rate of particles over a potential barrier for it is generally assumed that the particle flux out of the well can be obtained from a steady state solution of smoluchowski s equation .",
    "the general formula for the rate constant for the release of particles from the potential well that chandrasekhar obtained as a solution of the fokker - planck equation , shows that the formula based on smoluchowski s equation is one extreme of the solution when the spatial gradient of the forces ( per unit mass of the particle ) is small compared with the particle response time which in many cases of interest does not apply ( see reeks et al .",
    "the fact that chandrasekhar obtained a relatively simple formula for the most general result ( not restricted by the value of the particle response time ) is very important to the analysis we present here .",
    "the situation analyzed by chandrasekhar is slightly different from the case we wish to consider here where particles from the bulk of the suspending fluid are subject to a potential barrier as they approach a wall where they are finally deposited .",
    "it turns out that the analysis is exactly the same as that used by chandrasekhar , as indeed is the form for the deposition flux.what is different is the way we need to normalize the flux . in the one case",
    "when particles are trapped in a well it is the rate constant for escape that we require by dividing the flux by the number of particles in the well whereas in the case of interest , it is the deposition velocity which means we divide the current by the concentration in the bulk or more precisely when referring to the situation in figure [ fig : potential barrier for depositing particles ] to the concentration at the bottom of the potential barrier at @xmath0    o0.5    with reference to fig ( [ fig : potential - wells ] ) we begin with the case analyzed by chandrasekhar @xcite where by brownian diffusion , particles in a 1-d potential well with minimum potential at a escape over a potential barrier of height @xmath1 at @xmath2 into the potential well at b. a complete solution can be found by solving the fokker - planck equation for the phase space distribution ( combined spatial and velocity distribution ) for brownian motion in a conservative field of force .",
    "however whilst this can be achieved numerically at least for a 1 d potential , for the case when @xmath3 the kinetic energy of a particle per unit mass , analytical solutions can be found under certain realizable conditions .",
    "we refer to chandrasekhar ( 1943 ) @xcite and the conditions for which the fokker - planck equation reduces to an advection gradient diffusion eq .. ( smoluchowski s eq . )    @xmath4    where :    * @xmath5 is the stokes inverse particle relaxation time * @xmath6 is the particle concentration and @xmath7 the force acting on an individual particle both at position @xmath8 .",
    "* @xmath9 is the diffusion coefficient for dispersion in velocity space , @xmath10 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath11 is the particle mass and @xmath12 the absolute temperature .",
    "it is important to appreciate that smoluchowski s equation is only valid if we ignore any changes in time intervals @xmath13 or space intervals @xmath14    so we may consider the escape of particles from a over the potential barrier at c in terms of of quasi - steady concentration and a constant ( spatially and time independent ) advection diffusion current @xmath15 , implying from eq.[eq:-2 ] that @xmath16 if @xmath17 is independent of @xmath18 and derived from a potential @xmath19 such that @xmath20    @xmath21 + so integrating between two points @xmath22 and @xmath23 we obtain @xmath24 where we have replaced @xmath25 by @xmath26 .",
    "now lets determine the rate constant or the probability per unit time that a particle will be escape over the potential barrier at c into potential well around b. we assume that most of the particles are in quasi equilibrium around a and the height of the potential barrier @xmath27 .",
    "this means that to a high degree of approximation , a distribution of velocities very close to gaussian will exist in the neighborhood of a and that the concentration @xmath28 in the neighborhood of a will be given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the concentration of particles at a. we may assume also that @xmath31 and that referring to eq.([eq:-1 ] ) @xmath32 and so from eq.([eq:-1 ] ) @xmath33 the value of the integral will be largely based on the value of the integrand around @xmath2 where we can approximate @xmath34 to @xmath35 so @xmath36 so we have for @xmath37 @xmath38    to obtain a rate constant ( probability of a particle of escaping from the potential well in neighborhood of a into potential well at b we need to divide @xmath37 by the number of particles in the well in the neighborhood of a which we can approximate to @xmath39 so finally the rate constant for the release of particles from the potential well at a into the potential well at b is given by @xmath40",
    "we refer to the case where smoluchowski s equation does not apply and in particular the case referring to the potential in fig ( [ fig : potential - wells ] ) when @xmath41 . in other words",
    "the particle does not respond at all to any changes that might occur on timescales @xmath42@xmath43or and changes occur in distances @xmath44 . in terms of particles in the potential",
    "well we may safely assume that they are in equilibrium with a concentration in the well that varies as @xmath45 and a maxwell distribution of particle velocities @xmath46 independent of @xmath47 given by @xmath48 the region beyond @xmath2 is such that a particle only responds to the force which attracts it towards b , and there is no diffusion back into a. the potential around b acts as a perfect sink for particles .",
    "there is no fluid resistance to the particles motion and effectively the particles motion is such that immediately beyond c refers only to those particles traveling in the @xmath49 @xmath47 direction .",
    "so we can write the current @xmath37 immediately beyond c as @xmath50 so dividing by @xmath51 in eq.([eq:-2 ] ) gives @xmath52 @xmath53    unlike the rate constant based on smoluchowski s advection diffusion equation , the rate constant @xmath52 in eq.([eq:-3 ] ) does not depend on @xmath54 .",
    "the formula is based on what is called the transition state method @xcite .",
    "chandrasekhar @xcite has evaluated the rate constant by solving the fokker - planck equation for brownian particles in a potential well and obtained a solution that is valid for all @xmath5 .",
    "the solution necessarily contracts to the formulae previously derived for @xmath55 .",
    "the same assumption is made that the height of the potential barrier at c in figure [ fig : potential - wells ] , @xmath56 .",
    "we shall briefly outline how the formula is obtained and refer to chandrasekhar @xcite for the precise details .",
    "the fokker - planck equation for the phase space density @xmath57 for diffusion in a conservative field of force @xmath17 is given for 1d in space by @xmath58 where @xmath59 .the equilibrium solution is @xmath60\\ ] ] for which @xmath61 at a in figure [ fig : potential - wells ] and for future reference @xmath62 as chandrasekhar points out this can not be the solution for all @xmath47 because there would be no diffusion of particles over the potential barrier .",
    "for the case we are studying where @xmath56 we would expect the solution to be close to the equilibrium solution at @xmath22 .",
    "a solution is therefore sought of the form @xmath63\\label{eq:-6}\\ ] ] where @xmath64is very near unity in the neighborhood @xmath22 at @xmath65and for @xmath66 i.e. in the region of @xmath23 .",
    "chandrasekhar points out that the most sensitive region to calculate the departure from equilibrium in the neighborhood of @xmath2 where @xmath34 has the form given in eq.([eq : potenial around c ] ) so substituting the form for @xmath67 in eq.([eq:-6 ] ) into the stationary fokker - planck equation with @xmath34 given by eq.([eq : potenial around c ] ) of the eq.([eq : fokker planck eqn ] ) gives the following equation for @xmath68 :    @xmath69    where we have written @xmath70 as a function of @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "the solution of this equation satisfying the boundary conditions is @xmath73d\\xi\\label{eq:-7}\\ ] ] where@xmath74 and @xmath75^{1/2}+\\left(\\beta/2\\right)$ ] .",
    "the current at @xmath2 is given by @xmath76 which substituting the form for@xmath67 based on eq.([eq:-6 ] and eq.([eq:-7 ] ) for @xmath77 ) gives @xmath78^{1/2}e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\label{eq:-8}\\ ] ] using the formula in for @xmath51 in eq.([eq:-2 ] and the value @xmath79 the rate constant @xmath52 is given by @xmath80^{1/2}-\\beta/2.\\right\\ } e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\ ] ] note that for @xmath41 , @xmath52 contract to the transition state approximation eq.[eq:-3 ] and when @xmath81 @xmath52 contracts to the advection gradient diffusion approximation eq.([eq : smoluchowski rate constant ] )    r0.5",
    "in the previous section we considered the case where all the particles were contained in a potential well.the height of the potential barrier @xmath27 the thermal energy /unit particle mass which meant that most of the particles were located in the neighborhood of the minimum potential at a and were in thermal equilibrium .",
    "we used the number of particles in the well as a normalizing factor in the sense that the flux of particles escaping from the well was directly proportional to the number ofparticles in the well at any instant of time .",
    "so the ratio @xmath82 was a constant in time and defined a rate constant @xmath52 or equivalently the probability per unit time of a particle in the potential well at a of escaping over the potential barrier at c and into the potential well at b. @xmath83 is therefore typical of the lifetime of particles in the potential well around a.    we want now to consider a slightly different situation depicted in figure [ fig : potential barrier for depositing particles ] corresponding to particles being deposited at a wall at @xmath23 by diffusion but having to overcome a potential barrier at c before reaching the wall .",
    "the particles reach a from the left by brownian diffusion from a region where the external force acting on the particles is zero .",
    "we may assume that in steady state the flux at a scales on the concentration @xmath30 so @xmath84 .",
    "the formula for the deposition velocity @xmath85 is straight forward to obtain since it is readily obtained from the expression for @xmath37 we have obtained from the various cases we reconsidered before ( there is no need to divide by the number of particles in the well to obtain the rate constant . )",
    "so from the expression for @xmath37 given in eq.([eq:-8 ] ) and substituting the value of @xmath2 in eq.([eq:-9 ] ) we have @xmath86^{1/2}e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\omega_{c}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{k_{b}t}{2\\pi m}\\right)^{1/2}\\left(\\left[\\left(\\beta/2\\right)^{2}+\\omega_{c}^{2}\\right]^{1/2}-\\beta/2\\right)e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\label{eq:-10}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so for the value of @xmath85 based on the transition state method for which ( @xmath87 we have from eq.([eq:-10 ] ) @xmath88    and for @xmath89 ( based on smoluchowski s equation ) @xmath90^{1/2}-1\\right)\\omega_{c}^{-1}\\left(\\frac{k_{b}t}{2\\pi m}\\right)^{1/2}e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\;\\;\\\\   & = & \\frac{\\beta}{2\\omega_{c}}\\left[\\frac{4\\omega_{c}^{2}}{2\\beta^{2}}\\right]\\left(\\frac{k_{b}t}{2\\pi m}\\right)^{1/2}e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\\\ k_{d } & = & \\left(\\frac{\\omega_{c}}{\\beta}\\right)\\left(\\frac{k_{b}t}{2\\pi m}\\right)^{1/2}e^{-mq / k_{b}t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]"
