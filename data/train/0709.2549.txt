    "the spin - down of radio pulsars is caused by the conversion of their rotation energy into emission . according to the `` classical '' approach",
    ", their rotational frequencies @xmath1 evolve obeying the spin - down law @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a positive constant that depends on the magnetic dipole moment and the moment of inertia of the neutron star , and @xmath15 is the braking index .",
    "the latter can be determined observationally from measurements of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 as @xmath18 . for a simple vacuum dipole model of the pulsar magnetosphere @xmath19 ; the pulsar wind decreases this value to @xmath20 ; for multipole magnetic field @xmath21 @xcite . at the same time",
    "the measurements of pulsar frequency second derivatives @xmath3 have shown that their values are much larger than expected for standard spin - down law and are even negative for about half of all pulsars .",
    "the corresponding braking indices range from @xmath22 to @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "it was found that the significant correlations between @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath8 ( @xmath26 ) demonstrate the fact that the absolute values of the @xmath3 and @xmath27 are larger for younger ( with large @xmath28 ) pulsars @xcite .",
    "the anomalously high and negative values of @xmath10 and @xmath15 may be interpreted as a result of low - frequency components of the `` timing noise ''  a complex change of pulsars rotational phase within a timespan @xcite . or , as a result of any long - term influence on the pulsars spin - down . @xcite    it is clear that the timespan of observations is by no means intrinsic to pulsar physics .",
    "indeed , the variations of rotational parameters may take place on larger timescales as well .",
    "however , the timescale of observations naturally divides these variations into two separate classes of manifestations : ( i ) the well - known `` timing noise ''  the residuals in respect to the best fit for the timing solution and ( ii ) the `` long term timing noise ''  the systematic shift of the best fit coefficients ( i.e. in the measured values of @xmath1 , @xmath8 , @xmath10 ) relative to some mean or expected value from the model .    up to date we know nearly 200 pulsars for which the timespan of observations is greater than 20 years , and the values of their @xmath3 still turn out to be anomalously large @xcite .",
    "for example , for the _ psr b1706 - 16 _ pulsar , variations of @xmath3 with an amplitude of @xmath29 s@xmath30 have been detected on a timescale of several years ( see fig.7 in @xcite ) , with the value of @xmath10 depending on the time interval selected .",
    "however , the fit over the entire 25 year timespan gives a value of @xmath31 s@xmath30 with a few percent accuracy ( which leads to a braking index @xmath32 ) .",
    "in the current work we provide observational evidence of the non - monotonous evolution of pulsars on timescales larger than the typical contemporary timespan of observations ( tens of years ) , using the statistical analysis of the measured @xmath1 , @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",
    "we estimate the main parameters of such long - term variations and discuss their possible relation to the low - frequency terms of timing noise .",
    "we have also derived the parameters of pulsar secular spin - down .",
    "we plotted the @xmath33 diagrams for 295 and for 1337 `` ordinary '' radiopulsars .",
    "the smaller subset consists of pulsars with measured @xmath3 .",
    "the bigger one  of all the `` ordinary '' pulsars with measured @xmath1 and @xmath8 , taken from the atnf database @xcite .",
    "we have found a good correlation beetween these two parameters and determnined the mean slope of the @xmath34 distribution , which is in agreement with @xmath35 .",
    "as was stated above , earlier works have shown the possibility of long - term variations of pulsars rotational frequency .",
    "our statistical analysis shows that the measurements of most the @xmath3 reflect the pulsars spin - down evolution on a timescale larger than the duration of observations , and uses the parameters of 295 pulsars .    from the 389 objects of the atnf catalogue @xcite with known @xmath3 we compiled a list of `` ordinary '' radio pulsars with @xmath36 ms , @xmath37 s / s , and with relative accuracy of second derivative measurements better than 75% .",
    "we excluded recycled , anomalous and binary pulsars .",
    "26 supplementary pulsars from other sources @xcite were added .",
    "the parameters of all pulsars were plotted on the @xmath38 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ) .",
    "the basic result of the statistical analysis of this data is a significant correlation between @xmath3 and @xmath2 , both for 168 objects with @xmath39 ( correlation coefficient @xmath40 ) and for 127 objects with @xmath41 ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "both groups follow nearly linear laws , however they are not exactly symmetric relative to @xmath42 .",
    "we divided both branches into 6 intervals of @xmath2 , computed the mean values and their standard deviations of @xmath43 for each interval .",
    "we rejected the hypothesis of the branches symmetry with a 0.04 significance level . also , the absolute values of @xmath44 are systematically larger than the corresponding @xmath45 ( the difference is positive in 5 intervals out of 6 ) and the difference of analytical fits to branches is positive over the @xmath46 @xmath47 interval of @xmath2 .",
    "these are the arguments in favour of a small positive assymetry of the branches .",
    "we found an obvious correlation of @xmath2 with the characteristic age @xmath48 ( @xmath49 , see fig .",
    "[ fig_taudnu ] ) : @xmath50 this correlation will be discussed below in the light of the @xmath51 dependency .",
    "the main feature of ( [ eq_tau_dnu ] ) is that the index of power @xmath52 is significantly different from @xmath53 .",
    "it is obvious that @xmath8 would be @xmath54 if @xmath1 and @xmath2 were completely uncorrelated .",
    "therefore , the derived result provides an argument in favour of the @xmath55 correlation .",
    "the @xmath2 and @xmath56 are nearly proportional , which leads to a significant correlation of @xmath56 both with @xmath10 ( @xmath57 for the positive branch and @xmath58 for the negative one , fig .",
    "[ fig_ddotnutau ] ) and with @xmath15 ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 correspondingly , fig .",
    "[ fig_ntau ] ) .",
    "the correlations found are fully consistent with the results published in @xcite , as well as in @xcite .",
    "however , the branches with @xmath60 and @xmath41 in those works were not analysed separately from each other ( not as @xmath61 ) .",
    "young pulsars confidently associated with supernova remnants are systematically shifted to the left in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ( open symbols ) .",
    "the order of magnitude of their physical ages roughly corresponds to that of their characteristic ages .",
    "this means that any dependence on @xmath2 or @xmath56 reflects the dependence on pulsar age .    the @xmath62 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] ) may be interpreted as an evolutionary one . in other words ,",
    "each pulsar during its evolution moves along the branches of this diagram while increasing the value of its @xmath2 ( which corresponds to the increase of its characteristic age ) .",
    "however , there is an obvious contradiction : on the negative branch , @xmath2 , being negative , may only decrease with time ( since @xmath3 is formally the derivative of @xmath2 ) , and the motion along the negative branch may only be backward ! this contradiction is easily solved by assuming non - monotonous behaviour of @xmath63 , which has an irregular component ( @xmath64 ) along with the monotonous one ( @xmath65 ) , where the subscript `` ev '' marks the evolutionary value .",
    "the characteristic timescale @xmath66 of such variations must be much shorter than the pulsar life time and at the same time much larger than the timescale of the observations . as it evolves , a pulsar repeatedly changes sign of @xmath3 , in a spiral - like motion from branch to branch , and spends roughly half its lifetime on each one .",
    "the asymmetry of the branches reflects the positive sign of @xmath67 , and therefore , secular increase of @xmath12 ( i.e. all pulsars in their secular evolution move to the right on the @xmath62 diagram ) .",
    "the systematic decreasing of the branches separation reflects the decreasing of the variations amplitude and/or the increasing of its characteristic timescale .",
    "any well known non - monotonous variations of @xmath68 , like glitches , microglitches , timing noise or precession , will manifest themselves in a similar way on the @xmath62 diagram and lead to extremely high values of @xmath3 @xcite . however , their characteristic timescales vary from weeks to years , and they are detected immediately .",
    "but here the variations on much larger timescales are discussed , and their study is possible only statistically , assuming the ergodic behaviour of the ensemble of pulsars .",
    "in addition , the apparent branches separation on the @xmath69 diagram is only due to the logarithmic scale of the plot .",
    "the spread of @xmath3 values in each branch reaches 3 orders of magnitude , i.e. the pulsars on the diagram cover almost fully the range of possible @xmath3 values ( for each value of @xmath2 ) .",
    "moreover , we observe the lack of pulsars near @xmath70 because ( i ) the present accuracy of the @xmath3 measurements is no better than @xmath71 @xmath72 and ( ii ) in this area pulsars move faster than anywhere , because here @xmath73 , @xmath3 changes its sign and hence the third derivative of @xmath1 has an extremum .",
    "variations of the pulsar rotational frequency may be complicated  periodic , quasi - periodic , or completely stochastic .",
    "generally , it may be described as a superposition @xmath74 where @xmath11 describes the secular evolution of pulsar parameters and @xmath75 corresponds to the irregular variations .",
    "similar expressions describe the evolution of @xmath2 and @xmath3 after a differentiation .",
    "@xmath76 satisfies the obvious condition of zero mean value : @xmath77 over the timespans larger than the characteristic timescale of the variations .",
    "the amplitude of the observed variations of @xmath10 is related to the dispersion of this process as @xmath78    the second derivative values on the upper @xmath79 and lower @xmath80 branches in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] may be approximately described as @xmath81 for each pulsar .",
    "this equation describes an `` average '' pulsar , while the spread of points inside the branches reflects the variations of individual parameters over the pulsar ensemble and reaches 4 orders of magnitude .",
    "the second derivative @xmath3 is the only parameter significantly influenced by the timing variations ( see section [ disc ] ) .",
    "thus one can assume that the measured values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 may be considered to be evolutionary , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( since @xmath84 and @xmath85 are small ) .",
    "using the relations described above , the secular behaviour @xmath87 ( or , @xmath88 ) may be found by plotting the studied pulsar group onto the @xmath51 diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig_dotnunu ] ) .",
    "the objects with @xmath89 and @xmath41 are marked as filled and open circles , correspondingly .",
    "it is easily seen that the behaviour of these two sub - groups is the same , which is in agreement with the smallness of the pulsar frequency variations in respect to the intrinsic scatter of @xmath90 . however , a strong correlation between @xmath1 and @xmath8 ( @xmath91 is seen , and @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "so , the secular evolution of an `` average '' pulsar goes according to the `` standard '' spin - down law with @xmath14 !",
    "this result is very interesting on its own , especially since the @xmath1 and @xmath2 are always measured as independent values .",
    "note that the width of the fit on fig .",
    "[ fig_dotnunu ] is quite small  only about 1.5 orders of magnitude .",
    "if the spin - down is even approximately close to being described by the vacuum dipole model , then @xmath95 should scale as @xmath96 , where @xmath97 is the polar field and @xmath98 is the magnetic inclination angle .",
    "but the range of @xmath99 over the pulsar population is expected to be of many orders of magnitude",
    ". therefore , fig .",
    "[ fig_dotnunu ] once again shows that a simple vacuum dipole model is not adequate to observations .",
    "it is important that there is no contradiction between the derived value of @xmath100 and values of the braking index derived in the usual manner using @xmath3 ( these values lie in the range from approximately @xmath22 to @xmath23 ) .",
    "the measured @xmath1 and @xmath2 are weakly affected by the timing noise , so the pulsars move along the @xmath86 distribution mostly according to the secular component of @xmath3 . at the same time the combination @xmath101 includes both the secular and irregular components of @xmath3 , which leads to anomalous braking indices .",
    "the braking index @xmath100 allows us to describe the pulsars spin - down as `` quadrupole - like '' .",
    "but it is unlikely that such spin - down is due to the simple quadrupole structure of the ns magnetic field and the corresponding radiation . indeed , in case of vacuum approximation , for the rotating quadrupole with magnetic field strength @xmath102 @xmath103 ( where @xmath104 @xmath105 ) , the value of the parameter @xmath95 from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) would be as small as @xmath106 @xcite , which is ten orders of magnitude smaller than the values measured for the 295 and 1337 pulsars ( see figures [ fig_dotnunu ] and [ fig_f1f0full ] ) .",
    "moreover , the total contribution of all the high order multipole components ( quadrupole etc . ) is much smaller than that of the dipole component .",
    "howewer , it is clear that the described simple quadrupole spin - down does not satisfy the modern concept of the pulsars magnetospheres not being vacuum @xcite .",
    "a number of papers were published in the last years , where the possibility of quadrupole components of pulsars magnetic fields was discussed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "thus , at the same time , there is little reason to fully reject the hypothesis of a more complex pulsars magnetic fields structure than only dipolar .",
    "an additional argument in favour of the @xmath34 correlation is , as has been stated above , the dependence between @xmath2 and @xmath56 , where the index of power is not equal to @xmath53 . indeed , since @xmath107 , and if the @xmath34 correlation is absent , then @xmath1 may only bring in some scatter to the @xmath108 dependence without its slope changing ( on a logarithmic scale ) .",
    "but , if @xmath2 and @xmath1 are really correlated , and the slope ( braking index ) is about 5 , the @xmath108 dependence should show a slope of about @xmath109 which is roughly consistent with the measured value ( see eq .",
    "[ eq_tau_dnu ] ) .",
    "precisely , the slope of the @xmath110 fit , @xmath111 , and @xmath15 are related by the equation : @xmath112 so it clearly seen that @xmath15 is strongly dependent on @xmath111 .",
    "the value of @xmath15 derived from @xmath113 is @xmath114 .",
    "it differs from @xmath115 on a @xmath116 significance level .",
    "this value is less than the standard @xmath117 but close to it .    in a framework of pulsar spin - down analysis we ploted the @xmath118 diagram for the 1337 pulsars ( fig .",
    "[ fig_f1f0full ] ) taken from the atnf pulsar database @xcite .",
    "this subset does not include recycled , binary and anomalous pulsars , and satisfies the criteria described in section ( [ statan ] ) .",
    "the braking index derived from the plot is @xmath119 .",
    "this value is in a good agreement with the result described above .",
    "the precision of the slope measurement on fig .",
    "[ fig_f1f0full ] is so high mostly due to the large number of pulsars used .",
    "the mean slope of the fit for the @xmath86 distribution represents the average value of @xmath15 for pulsars during their lifetime ( @xmath120 ) . up to date",
    "there are several young pulsars with measured braking indices that are both accurate and precise .",
    "these are all smaller than but close to 3 .",
    "the fact that the measured value of @xmath15 was found to be greater than 3 , could mean that pulsars do not evolve with a constant @xmath15 @xmath121 .",
    "indeed , if the pulsars are really born with @xmath122 , and assuming they do not change this value during their evolution , then as they grow older , they should appear below the main distribution on the @xmath118 diagram : approximately in the area with @xmath123 @xmath47 and @xmath124 @xmath125 .",
    "as an example , the line with a slope which corresponds to @xmath126 is shown on fig .",
    "[ fig_f1f0full ] .",
    "this line significantly deviates from the main distribution in the area of the oldest pulsars .",
    "if the pulsars were to evolve along this line , they would arrive in the area below the main distribution as they aged .",
    "thus , the pulsars start their evolution with @xmath122 , which seems to be typical , and are likely to change their @xmath15 to higher values as they evolve .",
    "therefore , the authors consider to be reasonable the idea of young and old pulsars evolving with different values of @xmath15 .",
    "these values are smaller for younger pulsars and larger for older ones .",
    "such changing of @xmath15 can be explained , for example , by the changing of the dominating spin - down mechanism . in general , a number of scenarios were proposed , where pulsars braking index would increase with time ( see for example @xcite and references therein ; see also @xcite ) .    on the other hand , the increasing of the braking index",
    "may be explained by the evolution of the parameter @xmath95 from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) . in case of a simple dipole spin - down @xmath127",
    "and it is not constant for pulsars during their lifetimes .",
    "the magnetic field decay and magnetic inclination angle evolution ( @xmath128 , see @xcite ) will lead to the decreasing of @xmath95 for the old pulsars .",
    "hence , the absolute values of @xmath2 will be systematically smaller than the `` unshifted '' ones ( when @xmath129 ) .",
    "thus the slope of the @xmath130 distribution ( braking index ) will increase .",
    "a similar situation also takes place in the model of electric current spin - down @xcite . in this case , the relation @xmath131 is also true , but @xmath132 with @xmath133 , instead of @xmath134 with @xmath128 .",
    "in general , any pulsars spin - down law should depend on the polar magnetic field @xmath135 and , very likely , on the magnetic inclination angle @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , the idea described above should remain valid .",
    "if so , then the measured @xmath136 means that pulsars intrinsic braking index may be _ less _ than 5 .",
    "the provided analysis strongly suggests the presence of a @xmath86 correlation for ordinary pulsars with a mean slope ( braking index ) close to 5 .",
    "younger pulsars seem to evolve with a lower @xmath15 than the older ones .",
    "the pulsars magnetic field may have a more complex structure than dipolar , however there is little reason to insist that @xmath100 is due to a simple quadrupole spin - down .",
    "it may be a result of the pulsars magnetic field decay and/or the evolution of the magnetic inclination angle .      from eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) we may easily determine the relation between @xmath137 and @xmath8 as @xmath138 which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] as a thick dashed line .",
    "the same relation may be also estimated directly by using the asymmetry of the branches seen on fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] as @xmath139 where @xmath43 are defined in fig .",
    "[ fig_diagram ] . such estimation , while being very noisy , is positive in the @xmath140 s@xmath141 range and agrees quantitatively with the previous one .",
    "the amplitude of the @xmath3 oscillations , @xmath142 , may be easily computed in a similar way , by using @xmath79 and @xmath80 , as @xmath143 .",
    "the behaviour of pulsars according to the derived relations is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_model ] .",
    "this simple variations model describes the observed branches , both positive and negative , rather well .",
    "we interpret the absence of negative branch objects with @xmath144 s@xmath141 , i.e. with @xmath145 , as a prevalence of the second derivative s secular component over the varying one ( @xmath146 ) in this region .",
    "older pulsars begin to change the sign of @xmath10 because of spin rate variations .",
    "in general , it is impossible to estimate the amplitudes of the frequency and its first derivative variations @xmath147 and @xmath148 from the amplitude of the second derivative only ( the knowledge of its complete power density spectrum is needed ) .",
    "however , if the spectral density is relatively localized and some characteristic timescale @xmath66 of the variations exists , it is possible to set some limits on it .",
    "a rough estimation is @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 . on a long timescale",
    "the variations can not lead to pulsar spin - up , and therefore , the variations of frequency first derivatives are much smaller than their secular values , and @xmath152 , so @xmath153 .",
    "so , for the @xmath154 s@xmath141 range and corresponding values of @xmath155 from @xmath156 s@xmath30 to @xmath106 s@xmath30 , the characteristic timescale @xmath157 s. also , this characteristic timescale is obviously larger than the timespan of observations : @xmath158 years . assuming the constancy of @xmath66 during the pulsar evolution and therefore the change of @xmath147 with time , we get @xmath159 hz . for such a model the pulsar frequency varies with the characteristic time of several hundred years and the amplitude from @xmath160 hz for young objects to @xmath161 hz for older ones .    the characteristic timescale @xmath66 measured by the method above does not depend on the derived value of @xmath100 .",
    "therefore , even if the braking index is significantly bigger than @xmath162 , the values of @xmath66 and @xmath147 will not be changed .",
    "the physical reasons of the discussed non - monotonous variations of the pulsar spin - down rate may be similar to the ones of the timing noise on a short timescale .",

    "the pulsars show different timing behaviour .",
    "but on the long timescale their behaviour seems to be alike .",
    "the argument in favour of the similarity between the discussed variations and the timing noise is the coincidence of the timing noise @xmath10 amplitude extrapolated according to its power spectrum slope @xcite to the timescale of hundreds of years , with the @xmath155 derived from our analysis for the same @xmath8 , i.e. the same ages .    at the same time",
