    "very high energy ( vhe , @xmath1 ev ) particles can be traced within our galaxy by a combination of non - thermal x - ray emission and vhe gamma - ray emission via leptonic ( i.e. inverse compton scattering of electrons , bremsstrahlung and synchrotron radiation ) or hadronic ( i.e. the decay of charged and neutral pions , due to interactions of energetic hadrons ) processes .",

    "in other sources in the galactic center region ( e.g. hess j1745 - 303 @xcite and the gc diffuse emission @xcite ) , there is evidence that interactions of cosmic rays with molecular clouds ( mcs ) play a role in vhe gamma - ray production .",

    "given that the estimated flux of hess j1741 - 303 is approximately 1% of the crab , a weak pwn scenario is plausible .",

    "all the sources are located in the galactic plane ( or slightly off the plane ) and appear extended in vhe gamma rays . since these sources have so far no clear counterpart in lower - energy wavebands , further multi - wavelength studies are required in order to understand the emission mechanism powering them .",
