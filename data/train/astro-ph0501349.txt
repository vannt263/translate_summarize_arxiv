    "optical radiation from low - mass x - ray binaries is often attributed to thermal emission from the outer accretion disk or companion star ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "both their magnitude and time lag with respect to the x - ray peak ( which is on the order of seconds ) are in line with what is expected for reprocessing in the outer disk . in black hole systems , however , the larger accretion disks may be able to account for most of the optical radiation .",
    "evidence for reprocessing is not as direct ; type - i x - ray bursts are not present and often special techniques ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are required to search for the effects of x - ray reprocessing .",

    "black hole soft x - ray transients ( sxts ) @xcite provide an excellent opportunity to investigate the importance of irradiation and non - thermal processes to the optical spectra of x - ray binaries .",
    "these systems spend most of their time in quiescence , but occasionally they show outbursts as the result of a dramatic increase in mass accretion rate . during these phases , sxts brighten by many orders of magnitude at almost all wavelengths .",
    "x - ray monitoring during outbursts has revealed a rich behavior that is usually described in terms of distinct phenomenological x - ray states and the transitions between them .",
    "the nomenclature of these states has undergone many and , at times , confusing changes in the past .",
    "our understanding of black hole state is still evolving and in order to avoid the risk of using a classification scheme that may soon be outdated , we opt for a very simplified nomenclature in this paper .",
    "we recognize only three states , based on the slope of the spectral power - law index and the presence / strength of band - limited noise in the power spectrum .",
    "these states are : 1 ) a spectrally hard state , in which the spectrum is dominated by a power - law component with photon index @xmath01.3 - 1.5 and the spectrum is dominated by strong ( @xmath02040 % rms ) band - limited ( flat - topped ) noise , 2 ) an spectrally intermediate state , in which the power - law index varies between @xmath01.5 and @xmath02.5 and the band - limited noise and qpos increase in frequency and decrease in strength ( @xmath01020 % rms ) with photon index 3 ) a spectrally soft state , in which the spectrum is dominated by a thermal component , the power - law index is @xmath02.5 or higher , and the power spectrum does not show strong band limited noise , but relatively weak red noise , with or without qpos .",
    "our definition of the spectrally soft state includes observations that would be classified as steep power - law state or thermal - dominant state by @xcite , but for this paper we do not distinguish between these states , as they turn out to have very similar optical / nir properties .",
    "it is important to realize that the criteria summarized above are merely guidelines .",
    "one usually needs to study an entire outburst to identify groups of distinct behavior before individual observations can be classified .",
    "a full characterization of the states in gx 3394 is going to be addressed in @xcite and @xcite ; a full description of states is not relevant to this paper . here",
    "it is enough that to distinguish the hard and intermediate states from the others .",
    "the observed changes in the spectral and variability properties between the x - ray states suggests that the geometry of the inner accretion flow evolves considerably from one state to the other .",
    "the efficiency of irradiation of the disk ( and companion star ) is probably affected by such changes in the geometry ; e.g. , a spherical geometry , such as a compact corona , emits radiation more isotropically than the ( presumably ) flat inner parts of a thin accretion disk .",
    "also , radio observations indicate that in the hard , and intermediate states a strong outflow is often present @xcite , which may contribute to the infrared , optical and x - ray fluxes @xcite .",
    "significant spectral changes are therefore expected to occur and are , in fact , observed in the optical / nir ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) as the source moves from one state to another .",
    "these changes can be used to distinguish the different mechanisms responsible for the optical / nir as well as to constrain models for the accretion flow geometry in the different x - ray states .    in this paper",
    "we present ( quasi-)simultaneous x - ray and optical / nir observations of the black hole sxt gx 3394 .",
    "this source was discovered with @xmath2 - 7 in 1972 @xcite and an optical counterpart was identified by @xcite .",
    "since then it has undergone several outbursts during which it was observed in all states at x - ray , optical / nir , and radio wavelengths ( see references in * ? ? ?",
    "it is an easy target to observe in optical and infrared bands with an @xmath3 of 15.420 .",
    "a mass function of 5.8@xmath40.5 m@xmath5 was established by @xcite strongly supporting the black hole classification of the primary .",
    "optical observations of gx 3394 in 1981 @xcite revealed fast variations and even a 20 s qpo which were interpreted by @xcite as varying cyclotron emission from a very hot gas .",
    "@xcite report a sudden decline in the @xmath6-band magnitude as the source made a transition from the a spectrally hard to a spectrally soft x - ray state , after which an anti - correlation was observed between @xmath3 and the 36 kev flux .",
    "they were able to fit the hard state spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the source from the infrared ( @xmath714 ) to x - rays ( @xmath819 ) with a single power - law , while the soft state sed showed strong deviations from a single power - law .",
    "on the basis of this they suggested that different optical emission mechanisms operate in the two x - ray states .",
    "their hard state sed is of particular interest as it has recently been suggested that the in the hard state the sed may be dominated from radio to x - ray wavelengths by emission from a jet outflow @xcite .",
    "monitoring of gx 3394 in the hard state revealed that radio and x - ray fluxes correlate over more than three decades of x - ray flux over a four year time period @xcite .",
    "this correlation extends to other sxts @xcite and even agn @xcite .",
    "here we show that a similar correlation is present during the 2002 hard state of gx 3394 between optical / nir and x - rays over a similar range in x - ray flux .",
    "the observations discussed here were performed during the rise of an outburst that started early april 2002 @xcite . thanks to an extensive monitoring campaign ( by david smith and co - workers ) with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( _ rxte _ ) we were able to follow the source in x - rays from quiescence to the peak of the outburst . a similar optical / nir monitoring campaign was started just before the outburst , which resulted in an excellent x - ray ",

    "v11.2 ) using an overall normalizing constant that was allowed to float for cross - calibration purposes .",
    "we used the following combination of models : a ( cut - off ) power - law ( cutoffpl or powerlaw ) , a multi - temperature thermal model ( diskbb - hereafter referred to as the disk component , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , a relativistically smeared emission line around 6.5 kev ( laor ) , a smeared absorption edge ( smedge ) , and an absorption component ( phabs ) .",

    "@xmath12 was fixed to a value of @xmath13 atoms @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this model led , on average , to values of @xmath15 that were slightly smaller than 1 .",
    "note that in the early phase of the outburst the disk component , the emission line and the smeared edge were not significantly detected and therefore removed from our fit model .",
    "also , when the source was not significantly detected with hexte , fits were made to the pca spectrum only .",
    "unabsorbed fluxes were measured in the 3100 kev range .",
    "if no fits were made to the hexte spectra , the fit to the pca spectrum was extrapolated .",
    "a more detailed description of the spectral ( and variability ) analysis and a complete overview of the fit results of the whole outburst will be presented elsewhere .",
    "in figure [ fig : curves]a we show three x - ray light curves of gx 3394 during the first half of its 2002/2003 outburst : the total flux ( solid line ) , the flux of the ( cut - off ) power - law ( dashed line ) , and the disk black - body flux ( dotted line ) , all in the 3100 kev band . the first significant detection ( @xmath16 ) of the source with the _ rxte_/pca was made on mjd 52324 ( marked by the upward arrow ) , although the outburst likely started before this date .",
    "for comparison we have also marked the date of the first detection with the _ rxte_/asm , on mjd 52365 , by the downward arrow . had the source not been monitored with the _",
    "rxte_/pca we would not only have missed out on more than 40 days of valuable x - ray data , but we would also have miscalculated the true delay between the x - ray and optical / nir rise .",
    "extrapolation of the light curve around the time of the first asm detection back to zero flux ( based either on pca or asm data ) resulted in an earlier start ( 1525 days earlier ) , but still considerably later than the first pca detection .",
    "the presence of an initial slow rise , as observed with the pca , shows that the start times obtained from such extrapolations should be interpreted with some care .",
    "for the same reason we do not use the first significant pca observations to obtain a improved start time ; we simply do not know the shape of the light curve below our detection limit .    the dashed - dotted horizontal line figure [ fig : curves]a indicates the average flux measured in the 8 observations prior to mjd 52324",
    "this flux level ( a significant detection of @xmath01.4 x 10@xmath17 erg  s@xmath18@xmath14 ) is about a factor of 10 higher than the lowest values observed during quiescence ( in september 2000 by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but probably represents the confusion limit for the pca ( r. remillard , private communication ) .",
    "if so , this indicates that we may have missed a considerable part of the rise due to the limited sensitivity of the pca compared to the x - ray imaging instruments ( bepposax and xmm - newton ) that were used for the observations in quiescence .",
    "the rise of the outburst was initially slow , with an increase in 25 days by a factor of @xmath06 with respect to the level in the 55 days before mjd 52324 .",
    "the next 30 days saw a dramatic increase by a factor of more than 350 in flux .",
    "after mjd 52380 the rate of increase slowed down considerably with the source entering a broad maximum for about 20 days during which it reached a maximum flux of 3.25 x 10@xmath19 erg  s@xmath18@xmath14 .        before mjd 52405",
    "the contribution of the disk component to the x - ray spectrum was very small , with the power - law component contributing close to 100% of the 3100 kev flux , as can be seen in figure [ fig : curves]b .",
    "no disk component was detected before mjd 52366 , after which we measured values that were typically @xmath01% of the total flux .",
    "this changed dramatically on mjd 52405 when the disk flux had increased by a factor of more than 35 compared to the previous observation , three days earlier .",
    "this day also marked a change of behavior in the power - law flux which , until then , had shown only smooth day - to - day variations , but suddenly showed erratic changes on top of a steady decline .",
    "although the power - law fraction ( fig .  [ fig : curves]b ) suggests that the x - ray spectrum did not change considerably before mjd 52405 , x - ray color curves @xcite indicate that spectral changes already started before mjd 52400 .",
    "it is interesting to see that , like the power - law flux , the disk flux showed a decline for about 25 days after it reached a local maximum on mjd 52414 .",
    "after mjd 52438 the source entered a long period in which the disk component contributed more than 75% of the 3100 kev flux , showing a slow increase followed by a similarly slow decrease . during this period the power - law flux showed large variations .",
    "it should be noted , however , that it was in general hard to constrain the high energy part of the spectrum in this part of the outburst , because of the low number of counts .",
    "based on the definitions of the x - ray states given in ",
    "[ sec : intro ] we can attempt to ( preliminary ) classify the x - ray observations .",
    "the period until mjd 52398 can be classified as a hard state ; the power spectrum was dominated by a power law component with an index of @xmath01.31.4 . as the luminosity increased the power - law component showed minor steepening .",
    "this steepening accelerated around mjd 52398 , which is the day where we put the transition to the intermediate state .",
    "in addition to the rapid steepening of the power - law component to an index of @xmath02.5 we also observed accelerated changes in the qpo frequencies @xcite during the intermediate state .",
    "note that the exact date of the transition from the hard state to intermediate state is to some extent arbitrary as many of the properties show a smooth evolution across the transition .",
    "however , the date of mjd 52398 is chosen also because it marks a clear change in the optical and nir properties of the source ( see  [ subsec : oir ] and  [ ref : corr ] ) and in the hardness - intensity diagram @xcite .",
    "the intermediate state ended on mjd 52410 . on that day the power spectrum showed strong band - limited noise , while on the next day ( and some of the following days ) we detected red noise and type b qpos @xcite . note that during the intermediate state , on mjd 52402 , the disk flux showed a dramatic increase , without substantially changing or interrupting the evolution of the power - law index and type c qpo frequencies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a definition if qpo types ) . from mjd 52411",
    "onward the source showed several types of power spectra , but the spectra were in general much softer ( see fig.[fig : curves]b ) and the variability weaker than before that time .",
    "we classify all these observations as the spectrally soft state , ignoring for the moment the significant changes in the variability properties within that state .",
    "the approximate times of the hard / intermediate state and intermediate / soft state transitions are indicated by the vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : curves ] .",
    "the outburst in the optical / nir ( fig.[fig : curves]d  f ) started around mjd 52317 , a week before our first significant detection in x - rays .",
    "we note , however , that this start is also consistent with zero delay between x - rays and the optical / nir ( see also  [ ref : corr ] ) , as the first pca detection does not necessarily represent the true start of the outburst in x - rays . between mjd 5229652300",
    "the @xmath10-band light curve indicates the possibility of a dip before the outburst .",
    "it is difficult to place any constraints on this , however , due to the lack of data during this time .",
    "after mjd 52317 , when the source was in the hard state , the optical / nir light curves all showed a profile similar to that of the x - ray flux ; an initially slow increase followed by a faster rise that evolved into a broad maximum .",
    "while the optical / nir color ( fig.[fig : curves]c ) remained at the same level for the first 35 days of the outburst , a clear reddening was observed around mjd 52360 .",
    "similar to the x rays , the optical / nir fluxes started decreasing as the source entered the intermediate state .",
    "after an initially slow decline the optical / nir light curves decreased dramatically around 52400 by more than 3 mag in @xmath10 , more than 2 mag in @xmath9 , and almost 2 mag in @xmath6 , all within 5 days . during this short phase",
    "the _ v - h _ dropped from 4 to 2 , indicating the spectrum became much bluer . by comparison ,",
    "the decay in x - rays was much slower than in the optical / nir , with a time scale of @xmath03040 days .",
    "after the fast decline a short dip ( @xmath034 days ) was observed in the _ i_- and _ v_- bands , but not in the _ h_-band .",
    "after this dip the optical / nir remained more or less constant .",
    "a few days before the disk component started to dominate the x - ray spectrum two changes occurred in the @xmath10-band light curve ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : flaring]a ) .",
    "first , the source brightened by about half a magnitude and , second , there was a sudden onset of variability .",
    "the variations had an amplitude of @xmath20 and a typical time scale of a day ( although our sampling does not exclude faster variations ) .",
    "they were were not observed in one or more of our three reference stars , hence they are intrinsic to gx 3394 .",
    "also , the apparent lack of variability in @xmath10-band between mjd 5241052435 can not be explained by the sparser sampling of the source during that period . by randomly removing points from the light curve in order to obtain a similar sampling as that between mjd 5241052435",
    ", we were not able to hide the large variation observed after mjd 52435 .",
    "note that while the onset of flaring nearly coincided with the disk component becoming the dominant x - ray spectral feature , the flaring remained present when the power - law component became more prominent again , at the end of our data set .",
    "unfortunately no observations were made in the _ v_- and _ i_-bands during the flaring period , so it is not known whether similar variations were also present in the optical .",
    "to get a better idea of the long - term changes in the _",
    "h_-band during the flaring period we calculated a 20 day running average of the total _",
    "h_-band light curve ( running averages with 1525 day intervals produced similar results ) .",
    "in addition to the first peak around mjd 52390 , the smoothed curve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : flaring]a ) shows a second broad maximum that peaks around mjd 52450 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : flaring]b we compare this second @xmath10-band maximum with the total and disk x - ray fluxes from the same period .",
    "note the change from a magnitude scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : flaring]a to a ( linear ) flux density scale in fig .",
    "[ fig : flaring]b . in x - rays the source reached a peak well after that in the _ h_-band with a delay of @xmath01520 days . by actually shifting the light curves in time with respect to each other , we find that they overlap best with a shift of about 18 days .      from figure [ fig : curves ]",
    "it is clear that in the hard state the profiles of the optical / nir light curves are similar to that of the power - law flux light curve . in the spectrally soft state ,",
    "however , the nir light curve is much more similar to that of the disk flux , with a much lower ir / x - ray ratio than in the hard state .",
    "the intermediate state seems to represent the transition between these two types of behavior . to illustrate this",
    ", we show a plot of _ h_-band flux density versus total x - ray flux in figure [ fig : flux - flux]a .",
    "h_-band magnitudes were converted back to flux density units , only using data points from the x - ray and _ h_-band light curves that were taken within less than 2 days from each other .",
    "the open circles in figure [ fig : flux - flux]a are from the ( hard state ) rise of the outburst until @xmath0mjd 52394 ( corresponding to the peaks in x - rays and the _ h_-band light curves ) . as can be seen , the x - ray and _ h_-band fluxes in this state are strongly correlated , with a correlation coefficient of 0.99 , although some scatter is present . fitting these points with a power - law yields @xmath21 = 0.53@xmath40.02 where @xmath22 .",
    "the relation seems to steepen somewhat toward higher x - ray fluxes .",
    "fits with a power - law to the points with an x - ray flux smaller and larger than @xmath23 erg  s@xmath18@xmath14  give indices of 0.65@xmath40.03 and 0.73@xmath40.03 , respectively , which , unlike the overall relation , are consistent with the slope of radio / x - ray relations found by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the fact that both are steeper than the overall correlation is due to the relative displacement of the two groups , with the low x - ray flux group having a relatively higher _ h_-band flux density .",
    "such a displacement could in principle be explained if there is another underlying component to the @xmath10-band flux , but not for the x - ray flux , so that at low light levels , the @xmath10-band levels off whereas the x - ray does not . note that errors on the x - ray fluxes obtained from xspec are hard to estimate , especially when multi - component models are used .",
    "power - law slopes measured using a wide range in errors were all consistent with each other .",
    "after the peak of the outburst , when it entered the intermediate state , the source started following a path that clearly deviated from the one traced out in the hard state .",
    "this path is indicated by the dotted line and the crosses in figure [ fig : flux - flux]a . during this period the _ h_-band flux dropped by a factor of @xmath017 , while the x - ray flux dropped by a factor of only @xmath01.4 . in the spectrally soft state",
    "the source traced out a clockwise pattern , which probably corresponded to the @xmath01520 day delay measured between the smoothed _",

    "to panel ( a ) confirms that during the rise of the outburst the _",
    "h_-band flux correlates well with the power - law component and that the circular pattern in the spectrally soft state is indeed due to a delay between the disk flux and _ h_-band flux density .",
    "plots of _ v_-band and _ i_-band flux densities versus total x - ray flux ( not shown ) are similar to those for the _ h_-band flux density .",
    "both correlate well during the hard state and can be fitted with a ( slightly flatter ) power - law with indices of 0.48@xmath40.02 for the _ i_-band and 0.44@xmath40.03 for the _ v_-band .      to relate the ( spectral ) changes in the optical / nir , x - ray and radio bands to each other , we have created several spectral energy distributions ( seds ) .",
    "the radio flux densities were taken and estimated from @xcite and @xcite ( also e.  gallo and s.  corbel , private communication ) .",
    "our optical / nir magnitudes were converted to flux densities @xcite and dereddened assuming an @xmath12 of @xmath24 atoms @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "the @xmath12 was converted @xcite to a reddening e(b - v ) of 0.94 , which was in turn converted into dereddening factors using the values found in @xcite .",
    "these factors were 1.67 ( _ h _ ) , 3.63 ( _ i _ ) , and 14.78 ( _ v _ ) .",
    "our x - ray spectra were deconvolved using the model fit ( with @xmath12 set to zero ) and then converted to flux densities @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : seds ] shows four seds : two from the hard state ( mjd 52368 , with x - ray data from mjd 52367 , and mjd 52382 ) , one from the intermediate state ( mjd 52406 ; radio data from mjd 52408 ) , and one from the spectrally soft state ( mjd 52483 ; x - ray data from mjd 52487 ) . for comparison we plot the sed of mjd 52368 also in the other three panels ( gray dots ) .",
    "note that the errors on the optical / nir points are correlated through the uncertainty on @xmath12 ( which dominates the error ) and should therefore have the same direction .",
    "the first two seds ( fig .",

    "this suggests that the hard state can be associated with an enhancement of the nir and , to a lesser extent , the optical . in this respect , it is important to distinguish between the hard state , where the hard component completely dominates , and the other three states which do show a hard component , but a ( much ) weaker and steeper one . observations of xte j1550564 during the second part of its 1998/1999 outburst suggest an anti - correlation between the optical / nir and the strength of the hard spectral component in the spectrally soft state @xcite , possibly indicating that the hard component in these states has a different origin that the one in the hard state , as has already been suggested before ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "there are several physical components to an x - ray binary , many of which are theorized to produce significant optical / nir emission : the accretion disk , the secondary star , a jet ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and/or a magnetically dominated compact corona ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the first two components",
    "the optical / nir can either be the results of internal or external heating by x rays , depending upon the state of the system and exact parameters . @xcite and @xcite showed that the companion star in gx 3394 is most likely an evolved low - mass star with little ( @xmath252030% ) contribution in the near - infrared in quiescence . assuming a black hole mass of 5.8 @xmath28 , a secondary mass of 0.52 @xmath28 , and an orbital period of 1.75 days @xcite , which gives a binary separation of @xmath29 cm , irradiation of the secondary by an x - ray source with a luminosity of @xmath30 erg s@xmath31 is unlikely to increase the optical / nir flux by more than a factor 10 , much less than the factor of a few hundred required to explain the observed optical / nir increase .",
    "this basically rules out the secondary as the dominant source of optical / nir emission in gx 3394 during outburst . in the following sections we discuss how the other suggested components can explain the observed optical / nir behavior .      during the rise in the hard state of gx 3394 we observed a strong correlation between the nir and x - ray fluxes .",
    "their relationship has a similar power - law form as the radio / x - ray correlations observed in the hard states of gx 3394 and other black - hole binaries @xcite , though with a slope of 0.53@xmath40.02 compared to 0.71@xmath40.01 .",
    "our slope was calculated using the full 3100 kev x - ray band rather than the 211 kev band used by @xcite , but extends over a similar range in x - ray flux as the radio / x - ray correlations .",
    "while the origin of the x - ray emission in the hard state is still a matter of debate , the radio emission is generally believed to be from a jet outflow ( for a recent review see * ? ? ?",
    "the similarity between the nir / x - ray and radio / x - ray relations suggests that most of the nir emission in the hard state could originate in the jet as well .",
    "this was already suggested by @xcite who found that the nir emission in the 1981 and 1997 hard states of gx 3394 lies on an extrapolation of the radio spectrum of the source .",
    "they interpreted the nir emission as being optically thin synchrotron emission from a compact jet .",
    "this interpretation is supported by several additional arguments .",
    "first , neither thermal emission from a ( heated ) disk cm ) and found that for a range of reasonable parameters it peaks at wavelengths well below the @xmath10-band .",
    "x - ray reprocessing can therefore not explain the observed upturn between the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands .",
    "] or companion star , nor a magnetically dominated compact corona , can explain the nir excess that is apparent from our two hard state seds , since these models predict an decrease toward longer wavelengths in the optical / nir .",
    "synchrotron emission from a compact jet can naturally account for this excess , as it is predicted to peak in the nir for x - ray binaries , and is intrinsically much redder than the other components @xcite .",
    "second , a disk origin of the optical / nir can probably also be ruled out on the basis of its observed decay by factors of @xmath0515 around mjd 52400 .",
    "such changes should occur on a viscous time scale , which in this system is much longer ( probably 1520 days , as we argue in  [ subsec : spl ] ) .",
    "reprocessing could in principle explain the fast time scales , since the optical would almost immediately follow the x - rays . however , if the sudden drop around mjd 52400 was the result of a decrease in the illuminating x - ray flux ( assuming a constant outer disk geometry ) the optical / nir spectrum should have become redder ( because of the lower outer disk temperature ) , while in fact the opposite was observed .",
    "finally , as soon as the disk black body started to contribute significantly in the ( 3100 kev ) x - ray band , the nir flux decreased dramatically .",
    "this behavior is similar to what is seen for the radio flux in gx 3394 , which is quenched in the spectrally soft state @xcite .",
    "although the above suggests that the nir in the hard state is dominated by emission from a ( compact ) jet , extended nir emission from galactic black hole binaries has so far only been observed once , in the micro - quasar grs 1915 + 105 @xcite .",
    "the typical size scales of the ir - emitting regions are in general too small to be easily observed with worse than subarcsecond resolution .",
    "we can look to the light curve for some clues about contributions from other mechanisms .",
    "the fact that the optical / nir emission did not return to pre - outburst levels after the mjd @xmath052400 decrease probably indicates that , during the hard state , other components in addition to a jet contributed to the optical / nir .",
    "the steep `` v '' shape of the sed from the nir to optical also suggests two distinct components to the emission , and while it seems fairly likely that the @xmath10-band data point is dominated by jet synchrotron , the @xmath9- and @xmath6-bands could be combinations of various components .",
    "possible contributors to the @xmath32 bands are thermal emission from an accretion disk or even irradiation of the outer disk or companion star as suggested by @xcite . while spectrally direct disk emission could be possible ( see fig .",
    "[ nonoz ] ) , the fast optical timescales observed are inconsistent with the expected thin disk viscous timescales and they limit the thermal contribution from the disk . the maximum disk contribution in the hard state is probably close to the level observed in the intermediate state after mjd 52400 .",
    "what we know is that the slope of the blue side of the `` v '' remained remarkably stable over the rising hard state , while the lower half seems to be rising more , comparatively .",
    "so whatever the underlying physics , it is clear that these two components are somewhat decoupled .",
    "most likely , the rise in the sed above the nir is due to some combination of thermal and non - thermal emission , but dominated by synchrotron / cyclotron emission originating in a different region from the outer jet responsible for the radio through nir emission",
    ". this could either be the foot point , or base , of the jet , or some kind of magnetized compact corona ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , though the difference between these two scenarios may be semantical .",
    "as a means for discussion , in figs .",
    "[ fig : jetmodel ] & [ nonoz ] , we show examples of two extreme cases involving jets .",
    "figure [ fig : jetmodel ] shows the case when a jet is responsible for most of the sed of the two observed hard states .",
    "we stress that these are not fits to the data , because they have not been convolved with the response matrices for the pca detector , nor do they include fine features such as reflection and iron lines .",
    "however , they represent the maximal jet model contribution to the sed , and can help define what is possible in a more conservative approach , shown in the opposite extreme in fig",
    ".  [ nonoz ] .",
    "the models in figure [ fig : jetmodel ] contain 3 basic components : the @xmath6 band is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the base of the jet , and the same emitting electrons inverse compton scatter with these synchrotron photons to create the bump dominating the higher x - ray frequencies .",
    "this base component must be slightly decoupled from the rest of the jet , which creates the radio - ir via self - absorbed synchrotron emission , or else it would be difficult to explain the steep `` v '' in the sed . such a decoupling is not expected , but could result from extreme cooling or escape of the radiating particles before a zone of ( re-)acceleration , whereas in a non - decoupled case the particles are predominantly cooling adiabatically .",
    "the models in fig .",
    "[ fig : jetmodel ] were calculated for a high inclination angle of 60 degrees .",
    "varying this angle by @xmath410 degrees leads to similar results , whereas angles of lower than 3040 degrees would have resulted in flatter spectra and angles higher than 7080 degrees ( for which there is no evidence ) in steeper spectra and a loss of power .",
    "we take the opposite approach in fig .",
    "[ nonoz ] , and show a model for the hard state sed of mjd 52368 , where the i / v data result mainly from direct multicolor thermal disk emission ( playing somewhat devil s advocate to show an extreme case despite arguments against it ) . the jet is assumed to radiate only beyond an acceleration zone , producing optically thick radio to nir emission , and leaving room for a separate corona to produce the hard x - rays ( not shown ) .",
    "the disk model shown has fairly extreme parameters , comprising @xmath33 in power for a 7@xmath28 black hole , with an inner disk temperature of only @xmath34 kev .",
    "this temperature was chosen to fall just below the soft x - ray data points , as is normally expected for bright hard states .",
    "these choices result in an inner disk truncated at @xmath35 and the outer disk ends at @xmath36 in order to go through the ir / optical data .",
    "a lower temperature would result in a similar fit for slightly lower luminosities , and thus greater values for the inner disk radius .",
    "this model is quite artificial in that the jet model is simply set to zero before the acceleration zone , and in reality there will be some emission from the base , or the corona is equivalent to the base of the jet and a self - consistent relationship to the outer jet must be worked out .",
    "either class of model has difficulty reproducing the steep `` v '' , which will be a tight constraint for any theory . within the context of an entirely jet - dominated model , a more sharply peaked particle distribution than quasi - thermal in the base , or modified geometry",
    "could give a better fit to the `` v '' .",
    "what is important to note is that jets have the potential to contribute greatly to the sed beyond the radio / nir , and in both cases the jet synchrotron emission is difficult to suppress . in order to fit the assumed optically thick - to - thin turnover near the @xmath10-band , and be significantly under the x - rays , either the power - law of accelerated particles must be very steep , or only a tiny fraction of the total number of particles can be accelerated . in these models we assumed @xmath37 of the particles",
    "were accelerated , with particle distribution spectral indices typical of shock acceleration ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "acceleration via other mechanisms such as magnetic reconnection as seen in solar flares would result in even harder spectral indices .",
    "the changes in the two hard state seds over time can be accounted for in jet - dominated models by varying the total power and with slight changes in the geometry and equipartition of energy .",
    "we plan to explore these variations along with full fitting to the x - rays in another paper .",
    "it is not clear if jet emission dominated the nir ( and possibly also the optical ) for the entire hard state . around mjd 52360",
    "we observed a strong reddening in the @xmath39 color , possibly indicating that only at that point the jet started to dominate the optical / nir emission .",
    "interestingly , taking only the hard state data after mjd 52360 the slope of the @xmath10-band / x - ray flux relation becomes 0.73@xmath40.03 , which is consistent with the value for the radio / x - ray relation ( 0.71@xmath40.01 ) .",
    "it should be noted however , that the slope of the data before mjd 52360 steepens to 0.65@xmath40.03 , which is also marginally consistent with 0.71 .",
    "the accelerated steepening of the power - law component in the x - ray spectrum coincides with the source leaving the nir / x - ray relation that was observed in the hard state .",
    "the steepening of the power - law component could be the result of increased cooling or less efficient particle acceleration .",
    "if at the same time also the fraction of accelerated particles goes down , this could explain the sudden drop in the optical and nir fluxes .",
    "regardless of the exact interpretation of the sudden decrease in the optical / nir , our observations strongly suggest that the compact jet started to change when the source enters the intermediate state , before it likely shut off completely in the spectrally soft state . at the end of the intermediate state",
    "the optical / nir was probably dominated by the contribution from the accretion disk ( see also  [ subsec : spl ] ) .",
    "after the source entered the intermediate state and then the spectrally soft state , the x - ray power - law component decreased on a much longer timescale than the optical / nir component .",
    "this further suggests a different origin for the power - law component in the other three states , as already mentioned at the end of  [ sec : comp ] .      while the optical / nir light curves in the hard state had a shape similar to that of the x - ray power - law flux , in the spectrally soft states they were more similar to that of the x - ray disk flux . the observed lag ( 1520 days ) of the x - ray flux variations with respect to those in the _ h_-band ( figure [ fig : flaring ] )",
    "strongly suggest a disk origin of the optical / ir emission in those states .",
    "the magnitude of the lag is in line with what one would expect for the time it takes for changes in the mass accretion rate in the outer disk ( where most of the optical / nir originates ) to reach the inner disk ( where the x - ray are produced ) , i.e. the viscous time scale .",
    "the fact that a delay of this order is observed also indicates that x - ray reprocessing is of minor importance to the nir continuum , since in that case changes in the x - rays would have preceded those in the @xmath10-band by several seconds .",
    "the disk origin of the optical / nir is also supported by the changes in the sed .",
    "the optical / nir points of the mjd 52406 sed were fitted by a power law with slope 1.4@xmath40.4 .",
    "this is marginally consistent with @xmath40 , which is expected for the rayleigh - jeans part of a multi - color disk spectrum .    the sudden onset of flaring in the @xmath10-band as the disk component became the dominant x - ray spectral component ( around mjd 52440 ) is not well understood .",
    "these fast changes are not observed in the x - ray band .",
    "the sampling in the x - rays is arguably not as good as in the @xmath10-band but individual x - ray observations made during the nir - flaring period show hardly any variability , making a reprocessing origin unlikely .",
    "the flares may have a similar origin as the optical flares found by @xcite in five quiescent soft x - ray transients .",
    "these have similar amplitudes , but shorter time scales ( up to hours ) .",
    "@xcite suggested a magnetic loop reconnection events in the outer accretion disk as a possible explanation .",
    "rapid optical / ir variability has been observed before in the hard states of gx 3394 and xte j1118 + 480 @xcite , but the time scales involved there are much shorter and the x - rays always show variations on a similar time scale .",
    "optical / nir monitoring campaigns of gro j165540 @xcite , xte j1550564 @xcite , and 4u 154347 @xcite revealed that in these sources the start of the outburst in x - rays lagged the start in the optical / nir by 311 days .",
    "these outbursts most likely started in an `` off '' state ( @xmath41 ergs@xmath31 ) , and could thus be different from the event reported here for gx 339 - 4 , which may have started in a higher luminosity state ( @xmath42 ergs@xmath31 , based on the lowest detected flux by @xcite and assuming a distance of 6 kpc ) .",
    "nevertheless , our results may be relevant for interpreting these other events .",
    "the reported delays are generally thought to reflect the viscous time scale of a thin accretion disk , which determines the time it takes for the increase in mass accretion rate to reach the inner , x - ray emitting regions of the accretion flow , and/or the time it takes to replace a radiatively inefficient advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in both the above cases",
    "the measurements of the delays were based on a comparison of optical / nir with _",
    "rxte_/asm data , which is far less sensitive than the _ rxte_/pca .",
    "our data set for the 2002 outburst of gx 3394 shows that a source may already be rising for several weeks before the asm is able to detect it .",
    "the x - ray delay that we measure with the pca is less than a week and consistent with zero delay , whereas the asm yields a delay of 20 - 45 days , a factor of more than 36 longer .",
    "obviously , this has important consequences for conclusions based on delays measured with the asm .",
    "for example , if the delays estimated from the asm light curves were longer than the true delay by the same factor as found in the case of gx 3394 , then the true delays in gro j165540 , xte j1550564 , and 4u 154347 may have been only 0.52 days .",
    "delays shorter than a few days are difficult to understand in disk instability models , which predict the x - rays ( from the inner disk or adaf ) to rise about a week after the optical / nir ( from the outer disk ) .",
    "no delays are expected if both the hard x - rays and optical / nir are produced by a jet or the base of a jet .",
    "in fact , the optical / nir should lag the x - ray in such a case , by seconds to minutes .",
    "however , it is not clear how the jet is fed with matter during the early stages of the outburst , as there is no sign of an inner accretion disk in the early x - ray spectra .",
    "one option is that the jet is not fed by the inner accretion disk , but rather by an independent flow , that is able to respond much faster to changes in the accretion rate than the accretion disk itself , and possibly couples directly to the jet .",
    "the existence of such a second flow has recently been discussed by several authors @xcite .      in the parts of the spectrally soft state and the intermediate state at the end of the 2002/2003 outburst",
    "fe k@xmath21 emission lines and reflection components in the x - ray spectrum of gx 3394 @xcite provide strong evidence for a source that irradiates the inner accretion flow with hard x - rays . assuming a concave shape for the accretion disk",
    ", one would expect that such a source of hard x - rays might also to be able to irradiate the outer parts of the accretion disk , which should be visible as enhanced optical / nir flux .",
    "however , the fact that no clear evidence is found for reprocessed x - rays in the optical / nir suggest that the geometry of the irradiating source is not efficient for x - ray heating of the outer disk .",
    "this would favor a geometry for the hard x - ray source in which it is aligned with the disk plane ( and does not radiate isotropically ) rather than it being elevated above the disk .",
    "both from a spectral and variability viewpoint it is becoming increasingly clear that in some x - ray states the optical / nir emission in black hole x - ray binaries must have a strong non - thermal component ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our observations revealed , in great detail , a switch in the dominating optical / nir emission mechanism as gx 3394 moved from the hard x - ray state to intermediate state and then the spectrally soft state . in the hard state we found a correlation between the optical / nir and x - ray fluxes that extended over three orders of magnitude in x - ray flux and which had a similar slope as the one found between radio and x - ray fluxes in several black hole binaries , including gx 3394 .",
    "the non - measurable delay between x - ray and optical / nir fluxes and the spectral energy distribution suggest a non - thermal / jet origin for the nir emission in the hard state .",
    "the optical emission in the hard state is probably due to a combination of emission from a jet , a ( heated ) accretion disk and possibly a compact corona .",
    "as soon as the source entered the intermediate state we observed a large decrease in the optical / nir fluxes , which suggests changes in the jet properties , even though the radio stayed at a similar level as in the hard state . in the spectrally soft state",
    "the ratio of x - ray to optical / nir was a factor of 10 higher than in the hard state and the delay between nir and x - ray fluxes was more than two weeks .",
    "these changes in the x - ray and optical / nir properties suggest that the dominant source of optical / nir emission was a non - heated ( or only moderately heated ) accretion disk .",
    "it is interesting to note that in none of the x - ray states x - ray reprocessing in the outer disk seems to be the dominant source of optical / nir emission .",
    "our monitoring observations have shown that the optical / nir properties of black hole x - ray binaries are extremely sensitive to the x - ray state of the system . especially the x - ray to optical / nir",
    "flux ratio may be helpful in determining the state of systems for which accurate x - ray spectral and variability properties can not be obtained .",
    "finally , we want to stress the importance of extending optical / nir monitoring of black hole transients to perform variability studies simultaneously with x - ray observations .",
    "optical variability studies have often been done without simultaneous x - ray coverage @xcite and in cases were x - ray data was obtained , the observations were predominantly in the hard x - ray state @xcite .",
    "similar observations in other x - ray states will greatly increase understanding of the accretion flows in these systems , as the changes in the optical / nir variability properties ( e.g. energy dependence over many orders of qpo frequency ) can be related to changes in the spectral energy distribution and be used to rule out possible sources of optical / nir emission .",
    "for example , recent x - ray and optical observations of the black hole transient h1743322 by @xcite seem to indicate that so - called type b x - ray qpos ( observed in parts of the spectrally soft states ) no optical counterpart unlike those in the hard and intermediate states ( the so - called type c qpos ) , supporting claims that the optical / nir in these two states have very different origins .",
    "the authors would like to thank suzanne tourtellotte in assisting with the optical / nir data reduction , david gonzalez huerta and juan espinoza for observing at ctio , rob fender and jon miller for useful suggestions and comments , and finally elena gallo and stephane corbel for re - analyzing their radio observations .",

    "<S> we report on quasi - simultaneous _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ and optical / near - infrared ( nir ) observations of the black hole candidate x - ray transient gx 3394 . </S>",
    "<S> our observations were made over a time span of more than eight months in 2002 and cover the initial rise and transition from a hard to a soft spectral state in x - rays . </S>",
    "<S> two distinct patterns of correlated x - ray  optical / nir behavior were found . during the hard state </S>",
    "<S> the optical / nir and x - ray fluxes correlated well , with a nir vs.  x - ray flux power - law slope similar to that of the correlation found between x - ray and radio fluxes in previous studies of gx 3394 and other black hole binaries . as the source went through an intermediate state </S>",
    "<S> the optical / nir fluxes decreased rapidly and once it had entered the spectrally soft state , the optical / nir spectrum of gx 3394 was much bluer and the ratio of x - ray to nir flux was higher by a factor of more than 10 compared to the hard state . in the spectrally soft state changes in the nir preceded those in the soft x - rays by more than two weeks , indicating a disk origin of the nir emission , and providing a measure of the viscous time scale . </S>",
    "<S> a sudden onset of nir flaring of @xmath00.5 magnitudes on a time scale of a day was also observed during this period . </S>",
    "<S> we present spectral energy distributions , including radio data , and discuss possible sources for the optical / nir emission . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that in the hard state this emission probably originates in the optically thin part of a jet and that in none of the x - ray states x - ray reprocessing is the dominant source of optical / nir emission . finally , comparing the light curves from the asm and pca instruments , we find that the x - ray / nir delay depends critically on the sensitivity of the x - ray detector , with the delay inferred from the pca ( if present at all ) being a factor of 3 - 6 times shorter than the delay inferred from the asm ; this may be important in interpreting previously reported x - ray - optical / nir lags . </S>"
