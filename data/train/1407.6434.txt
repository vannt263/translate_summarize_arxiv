    "the fokker - planck equation has been the focus of many decades of study due to its relevance in physics , finance , probability and statistics @xcite .",
    "@xcite provides a particularly early example examining analytically tractable solutions to the fokker - planck equation , with more contemporary examples provided by @xcite .    essentially , this work focuses on time dependent densities @xmath0 , @xmath1 , of a diffusion process described by range @xmath2 given that it started at position @xmath3 , governed by , @xmath4 eq.([begin ] ) is defined on some interval on @xmath5 with endpoints @xmath6 where @xmath7 .",
    "the continuous functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are referred to as the diffusion , drift and the sink coefficients respectively .",
    "the applications of eq.([begin ] ) are wide ranging . for @xmath10 , eq.([begin ] ) is commonly referred to as the fokker - planck equation and one can readily show that @xmath0 is conserved for @xmath1 .",
    "the corresponding solutions to the fokker - planck equation are the time dependent probability densities associated with the ( it ) stochastic langevin process , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a gaussian white noise term with unit variance .",
    "the langevin equation is ubiquitous in a wide range of applications , from its beginnings in brownian motion ( see chap.1 of @xcite ) , to finance @xcite , biological processes @xcite and the synchronisation of networked oscillators @xcite .    for @xmath13 ,",
    "the corresponding continuity equation is sinked , thus we expect the quantity being measured in eq.([begin ] ) to seep away with time .",
    "it is conceptually important to develop analytically tractable solutions to eq.([begin ] ) as they are green s functions , which are both inherently mathematically interesting , and highly applicable - for an account of their application in physics see chap.7 of @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , greens / density functions appearing in this work also figure heavily in random matrix theory .",
    "we shall indicate some of these connections throughout this work . additionally , many past results for the conserved fokker - planck equation ( we offer @xcite as a typical example ) rely simply on the steady state density to gain insights .",
    "sinked densities allow no such avenue for inquiry as their solutions decay with time .",
    "we shall highlight this behaviour in the proceeding sections .",
    "the general strategy for solving eq.([begin ] ) is as follows : we first obtain the _ weight function _",
    "@xmath14 , found by solving the corresponding pearson s equation , @xmath15 for constants @xmath16 and @xmath17",
    ". given the form of the diffusion , drift and sink coefficients , we categorise the spectrum of eq.(1 ) as either discrete or mixed discrete / continuous .",
    "this gives us the general form of @xmath0 as , @xmath18 where the sum will be an integral for the continuous parts of the spectrum .",
    "we then find the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the system through standard techniques @xcite .",
    "the final step involves solving for the normalisation constants which satisfy the initial condition .",
    "for the discrete spectrum eigenfunctions we utilise the orthogonal polynomial relation ( chap.3 of @xcite ) , @xmath19 and for the continuous spectrum eigenfunctions we employ a macrobert s inverse integral transform of the form , @xmath20 see @xcite for an instance involving the whittaker functions , and @xcite and chap.14 of @xcite for examples involving bessel / hankel functions .",
    "these inverse integral transforms usually rely on some key results attributable to macrobert @xcite which we shall exploit when deriving the continuous normalisation for the romanovski case .    given the pervasive nature of the fokker - planck equation , green s functions and orthogonal polynomials ,",
    "most of the cases presented in this work have been fully solved in the literature _ without _ the sink term .",
    "what is new in this work is we present the full time dependent solutions for the sinked variants ( @xmath13 ) , and apply these results to obtain new solutions to the stochastic bertalanffy - richards ( b - r ) equation @xcite . for an introduction to the application of the b - r equation in population modelling and biological processes see @xcite .    in the next section",
    "we detail the forms of the diffusion , drift and sink coefficients that lead to the orthogonal polynomial eigenfunctions considered in this work . in sec.[1dsl ] we give necessary information about sturm - liouville ( s - l ) operators , the hilbert spaces their eigenfunctions span and how the sink terms in the s - l operators form associated variations of the orthogonal polynomials / eigenfunctions . in sec.[classification ] we detail how the form of the s - l operator determines the exact form of the spectra for the eigenfunctions , along with the corresponding solutions to eq.([begin ] ) . in sec.[applici ] we apply the results of this work to the stochastic b - r equation .",
    "finally we offer implications of these results and flag future work .",
    "applying the weight function , we decompose @xmath0 in eq.([begin ] ) as , @xmath21 hence the ensuing equation for @xmath22 is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the s - l operator @xmath25 we require that the operator @xmath24 be negative , i.e. all relevant eigenfunctions of @xmath24 have negative eigenvalues , @xmath26 the eigenvalues @xmath27 may be discrete or continuous depending on boundary conditions @xcite , to be specified explicitly in sec.[classification ] .      for this work @xmath8 and @xmath9 in eq.([s - lspectrum ] )",
    "have the specific forms : @xmath28 focusing on the @xmath29 case , theorem 4 of @xcite states that there are six classes of discrete spectrum eigenfunctions to eq.([s - lspectrum ] ) : hermite , laguerre , jacobi , bessel , fisher - snedecor ( shifted - jacobi ) , and romanovski ( pseudo - jacobi ) polynomials - the so - called _ continuous classical orthogonal polynomials_. for @xmath30 the eigenfunctions generally have the same polynomial form , but are multiplied by the diffusion coefficient @xmath31 raised to some power , @xmath32 , specified in sec.([1dsl ] ) of this work .",
    "we do not formally consider the hermite and jacobi case in this work ( we only refer to them ) as the hermite case offers nothing new , and the jacobi case only has finite support in @xmath2 . in @xcite , hypergeometric polynomial solutions to eq.([s - lspectrum ] ) for quite general forms of the diffusion and drift coefficients were studied .",
    "using the liouville transformation ( eq.([changevars ] ) of this work ) to transform eq.([s - lspectrum ] ) into a corresponding schrdinger equation , we note that the laguerre , bessel and romanovski potentials correspond to the _ coulomb _ ( chap.6 of @xcite ) , _ morse _ @xcite and _ trigonometric scarf _ @xcite potentials , albeit with an additional parameter corresponding to the sink coefficient .",
    "more recently the laguerre polynomials were applied as solutions to the non - linear madelung fluid equation @xcite and a burger s equation with a time - dependent forcing term @xcite .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite highlight the connection between the laguerre polynomials and the algebra @xmath33 , which is then exploited to construct the coherent laguerre function , and explore squeezed states in the calogero - sutherland model .",
    "@xcite also highlights connections between lie algebras and the associated laguerre functions .",
    "additionally , the non - sinked variant of eq.([solll ] ) for the laguerre case features in the financial cox - ingersoll - ross ( cir ) model @xcite , amongst other applications .    with regards to the bessel polynomials , in @xcite the ladder operators of the associated bessel functions were explored .",
    "the non - sinked variant of eq.([solll ] ) for the bessel case was derived as the fokker - planck equation of an ergodic diffusion with reciprocal gamma invariant distribution in @xcite , and features in many financial models ( see sec.6.5 of @xcite ) .",
    "following chap.4 of @xcite , the fisher - snedecor polynomials are a variant of the jacobi polynomials under a simple linear transformation such that the corresponding weight function s support is extended to the positive real line . in @xcite the non - sinked variant of eq.([solll ] ) for the fisher - snedecor case was derived as the fokker - planck equation for an ergodic diffusion with fisher - snedecor invariant distribution .",
    "refer to @xcite for the corresponding jacobi expression of eq.([solll ] ) which has finite support in @xmath2 and an entirely discrete spectrum .",
    "the romanovski polynomials have received a fair amount of attention lately due to their application in supersymmetric quantum mechanics @xcite , quantum chromodynamics @xcite , and connections with yang - mills integrals @xcite . the non - sinked variant of eq.([solll ] ) for the romanovski case ( without a closed form expression for the continuous spectrum normalisation )",
    "was first given in @xcite as the fokker - planck equation for an ergodic diffusion with the symmetric scaled student invariant distribution .",
    "multidimensional generalisations of the classical polynomials of course exist ( see @xcite , amongst other works ) and are a current active field of study .",
    "of particular relevance to this work we see in chapters 2 and 3 of @xcite that the probability density functions of the eigenvalues of the _ chiral _ , _ laguerre _ , _ jacobi _ and _ cauchy _ ensembles of random matrices give the multidimensional generalisations of the hermite , laguerre , jacobi and romanovski weights respectively .",
    "additionally , chap.11 of the aforementioned work considers potentials which correspond to various classes of quantum calogero - sutherland models . in particular",
    "we see that propositions 11.3.1 and 11.3.2 give multidimensional generalisations of the corresponding schrdinger hermite , laguerre and jacobi potentials ( amongst other more general cases ) , with the ( restricted ) green s functions of these three cases constructed in chap.11.6 .",
    "due to @xmath24 in eq.([s - lspectrum ] ) being a non - positive , self - adjoint s - l operator , the full set of solutions to eq.([s - lspectrum ] ) - present in eq.([solll ] ) - necessarily form a ( weighted ) square - integrable hilbert space @xmath34 with respect to the weighted inner product @xcite , @xmath35 the emergence of the continuous spectrum in eq.([solll ] ) for certain classes of eigenfunctions is due to the discrete spectrum eigenfunctions possessing so - called _ finite orthogonality _ ( see chapters 3 and 4 of @xcite ) : only a finite subset of the bessel , fisher - snedecor and romanovski polynomials obey eq.([finite1 ] ) .",
    "thus the continuous spectrum eigenfunctions are required to construct the hilbert space .",
    "following chap.22 of @xcite and chapters 7 and 8 of @xcite , if the spectrum of @xmath24 is mixed , the corresponding hilbert space is separable into the following orthogonal subspaces , @xmath36 where @xmath37 denotes the subspace of the hilbert space containing _ pure point _",
    "( discrete ) spectrum , and @xmath38 denotes the subspace of the hilbert space containing _ absolutely continuous _ spectrum .      recently in @xcite the associated variants of the laguerre , bessel and romanovski polynomials , respectively , were considered ( the associated fisher - snedecor functions are a simple variation on the romanovski case ) .",
    "the new results in this paper involve applying the aforementioned results and constructing the associated sinked densities .",
    "we list the canonical forms of the diffusion , drift and sink coefficients of the four relevant cases in tab.[tab1 ] , and give the weight functions and the corresponding support of @xmath2 for each case in tab.[tab2 ] .",
    ".canonical forms of @xmath31 , @xmath39 and @xmath9 considered in this work .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab7 ]    hence , the expression for the density of the bessel case is , @xmath40 and the corresponding expression for the fisher - snedecor case is , @xmath41      if @xmath24 exhibits oscillatory behaviour at both boundaries for @xmath42 , and @xmath43 , then eq.([solll ] ) is given by , @xmath44 where ( following sec.5.3 of @xcite ) the eigenfunctions with the continuous eigenvalues , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , are the linearly independent solutions to eq.([s - lspectrum ] ) which are square - integrable with @xmath14 , and are valid in the neighbourhood of the natural boundaries ( in this case , @xmath47 ) for which @xmath24 exhibits oscillatory behaviour .",
    "similar to spectral category ii , we note that @xcite , @xmath48 the discrete normalisation constants in eq.([genexp3 ] ) are given by eq.([ortho1 ] ) , and in [ romnormapp ] we explicitly derive the continuous normalisations @xmath49 , using the aforementioned macrobert s style proof .    from the forms of @xmath50 in tab.[tab4 ] and the corresponding support of @xmath2 , we see that the romanovski case fall under this particular mixed spectral category , and its highest discrete eigenvalue satisfies , @xmath51 concerning the discrete spectrum eigenfunctions , the associated romanovski functions @xmath52 have the following hypergeometric form , @xmath53 following chap.9.9 of @xcite , the eigenvalues and normalisation constants for this case are given by , @xmath54 under the restrictions , @xmath55 rescaling the continuous spectrum eigenfunctions , @xmath56 ( where @xmath57 is the complex conjugate of @xmath58 ) , the eigenvalues are parameterised by , @xmath59 and hypergeometric forms of @xmath58 are ( see @xcite and chap.15 of @xcite ) , @xmath60 where , @xmath61 the continuous orthogonality relations are given by , @xmath62 where @xmath63 and , @xmath64,\\nonumber\\\\ \\lambda_{1,2}(\\mu)=\\lambda_{2,1}(\\mu ) = 2^{2\\gamma+2 } \\pi \\left\\ { \\left| \\tilde{\\gamma}(\\mu ) \\right|^2 \\cosh\\left [ \\frac{\\pi}{2 } ( \\sigma_2 + 2 \\mu )   \\right ] \\right.\\nonumber\\\\ \\left",

    "hence the complete density function for the romanovski case is , @xmath66 we give an example of eq.([romres ] ) in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "notice that as time increases the total area of the density ( which begins at unity ) decreases .",
    "for @xmath67 we notice that the density is barely distinguishable visually .",
    "we compare this to the stationary density of the non - sinked case - the left most density - where area is conserved for all @xmath68 .    ) at various times with parameter values @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71.,width=491,height=188 ]",
    "we now present an application of this work - time dependent distributions corresponding to various instances of the b - r langevin equation .",
    "the b - r equation is a deterministic system given by , @xmath72 where @xmath73 .",
    "we note that when @xmath74 , the @xmath75 and @xmath76 terms act as growth and decay terms respectively ; the greater the value of @xmath77 , the more pronounced the decay .",
    "the choice @xmath78 gives the famous logistic equation .",
    "to proceed we consider the two uncorrelated noise terms @xmath79 and @xmath80 with variance @xmath81 , @xmath82 where @xmath83 means an ensemble average over the noise .",
    "we perturb the growth and decay coefficients by @xmath79 and @xmath80 respectively to obtain the following ( it ) stochastic langevin equation , @xmath84 where @xmath85 .",
    "eq.([ito ] ) can be _ solved exactly _ through the transformation @xmath86 leading to the linear langevin equation , @xmath87,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and the formal solution , @xmath88 we refer to the above solution for @xmath89 as formal as it contains integrals of specific instances of the noise terms ( meaning that each solution will be different for different noise instances ) . in order to make general statements about the above system",
    ", we shall construct its probability density function .",
    "following chap.4.5 of @xcite , the stochastic process in eq.([ito ] ) obeys the following fokker - planck equation , @xmath90 as mentioned in earlier sections , since the above equation contains no sink term @xmath0 is conserved , and its most natural interpretation is density of probability , where @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the population of a species .",
    "our goal of this section is to analytically solve for various cases of eq.([qands ] ) using our polynomial solutions for density functions given in sec.[classification ] .",
    "applying the standard decomposition in eq.([decomp ] ) , and the nonlinear transformation in eq.([itotrans ] ) , the resulting expression for @xmath91 is , @xmath92 \\xi + b + \\frac{\\omega \\zeta \\beta^2}{2 \\xi }   \\right)\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi } \\right\\}g(\\xi , t|\\xi').\\label{huen}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since the b - r equation is used extensively in population modelling , where the variable @xmath2 represents the number of living members of a species , only eigenfunctions in the range @xmath93 will be considered , hence leaving out the romanovski example .",
    "this leaves three relevant cases , laguerre , bessel and fisher - snedecor .",
    "the s - l operator on the right hand side of eq.([huen ] ) leads to the heun differential equation ( see chap.31 of @xcite ) . due to the heun equation possessing four distinct singular points , there is no equivalent hypergeometric closed form expression for the heun functions @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we find the following mapping between the heun system and hypergeometric solutions :    * @xmath94 leads to the laguerre case * @xmath95 leads to the bessel case * @xmath96 leads to the fisher - snedecor case    we shall only detail the laguerre and fisher - snedecor cases in this work as the bessel case was first solved in @xcite and along with @xcite is one of the earlier results involving analytical expressions of densities with mixed spectra .",
    "the case @xmath97 in eq.([huen ] ) leads to the biconfluent heun equation , whose solution suffers the same non - closed properties as the heun equation ( see chap.31 of @xcite ) .",
    "additionally , the case @xmath98 leads to the _ bessel process with constant drift _",
    "@xcite , which is a peculiar hypergeometric case ( beyond the scope of this work ) where the spectrum is mixed but the discrete part contains an _ infinite _ number of eigenvalues .",
    "setting @xmath94 , the weight function @xmath99 for this case is , @xmath100 applying the following change in variables , @xmath101 eq.([huen ] ) becomes , @xmath102 where eq.([brlag ] ) is the standard laguerre fokker - planck equation .",
    "hence , due to the initial condition , the time dependent solution for the density in this section is , @xmath103 to the best of our knowledge , eq.([brlag2 ] ) is a new result of a specific example of a b - r fokker - planck equation .    making the connection with the langevin equation this density",
    "is generated from , @xmath104 since for @xmath105 the deterministic system is divergent , but the density is normalisable , this particular case is an example of multiplicative noise stabilising the system @xcite .      setting @xmath96 the weight function @xmath99 for this case is , @xmath106 applying the following change in variables , @xmath107 eq.([huen ] ) becomes , @xmath108 where eq.([brfish ] ) is the standard fisher - snedecor fokker - planck equation .",
    "hence the time dependent solution for the density is , @xmath109 as with the laguerre case , to the best of our knowledge , eq.([brfs ] ) is a new result of a specific instance of a b - r fokker - planck equation . in fig.[fig5 ] , we give a specific example of eq.([brfs ] ) at various times .",
    "it is elementary to show that the weight function , which is proportional to the steady state density , peaks at the value @xmath110 .    making the connection with the langevin equation this density",
    "is generated from , @xmath111 we see that this example models linear deterministic growth , with linear and quadratic multiplicative stochastic terms .",
    "again , like the laguerre case , since the deterministic system is divergent , but the density is normalisable , this system provides another example of multiplicative noise stabilising a system @xcite .    ) at various times with parameter values @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 and @xmath116.,width=491,height=188 ]",
    "in this work we have given closed form expressions of sinked densities associated with ( at most ) quadratic diffusion and linear drift .",
    "the eigenfunctions relating to the discrete part of the spectrum are associated variants of classical orthogonal polynomials . we have given a macrobert s style proof to obtain a new closed form expression for the continuous spectrum normalisation associated with the romanovski density .",
    "this technique is sufficiently generalisable , given one knows enough about the analytic continuation properties of the hypergeometric function under consideration .",
    "we then applied these results to obtain the time dependent fokker - planck solutions associated with various cases of the b - r langevin equation .",
    "given the pervasive nature of langevin equations ( and the densities and green s functions associated with them ) in the physical sciences , we anticipate that these results are a stepping stone to a richer understanding of a variety of processes , both conserved and non - conserved .",
    "specifically , we hope that processes involving mixed spectra eigenfunctions become increasingly commonplace , as more analytic examples of solution appear which increase our mathematical understanding and our ability to apply such results in novel ways . paraphrasing the relevant introduction of @xcite ; in a world of ever increasing computing power , we must never overlook the benefits provided from analytic solutions in terms of special functions .",
    "they provide insight for understanding non - trivial relationships among physical variables with unsurpassed economy of effort , and are an invaluable tool for the validation of more complicated models which require computational treatment .",
    "the author graciously acknowledges alexander kalloniatis for his fruitful discussions and constant encouragement .",
    "we begin by conveniently labelling the double integral of eq.([newresult ] ) by , @xmath117 focusing on the case @xmath118 , we apply eq.([chi12 ] ) to split up @xmath119 for the region @xmath120 and deform the @xmath121 integral onto the contours @xmath122 and @xmath123 as shown in fig.[figcont ] to obtain , @xmath124     contours @xmath122 and @xmath123 used for the macrobert s proof.,width=377,height=188 ]    following chap.14 of @xcite and chap.7 of @xcite , we may reverse the order of integration as each term in eq.([int11 ] ) falls off like @xmath125 , @xmath126 , on the respective contours @xmath122 and @xmath123 , as @xmath127 .",
    "hence @xmath128 becomes , @xmath129 to proceed we note that ( chap.15.5 of @xcite ) @xmath130 , and their complex conjugates , obey the same governing s - l equation as @xmath131 and @xmath132 , as they are the corresponding linearly independent solutions in the neighbourhood of the singular point @xmath133 . thus decomposing",
    "either of the aforementioned eigenfunctions as , @xmath134 the resulting governing equation for the @xmath135 s is , @xmath136 we now recast eq.([niceii ] ) in terms of the @xmath135 s . through considering two copies of eq.([definej ] ) , one for @xmath137 and one for @xmath138 , we multiply the equation for @xmath137 by @xmath138 , and vice versa . subtracting the two expressions",
    "awards us with , @xmath139 integrating eq.([unamed ] ) over all of @xmath2 , and applying integration by parts we obtain , @xmath140^{x \\rightarrow \\infty}_{x \\rightarrow- \\infty}. \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using eq.([chi12 ] ) the asymptotic forms of the desired limits are given by , @xmath141 where , @xmath142 using the above asymptotic forms , eq.([niceii ] ) becomes , @xmath143 where @xmath144 and , @xmath145 in the following we consider the _ dirichlet integral _ expressions from chap.1 of @xcite and chap.3 of @xcite : @xmath146 where @xmath147 and the analytic function @xmath148 obeys _",
    "dirichlet s conditions _ on the interval @xmath149 on the interval @xmath149 entail : ( i ) @xmath148 contains only a finite number of discontinuities on the interval , ( ii ) @xmath148 contains a finite number of turning points on the interval . ] .",
    "thus we deform the contours @xmath122 and @xmath123 back to the real line segment @xmath150 , and let @xmath151 and @xmath152 . assuming that the function @xmath153 obeys dirichlet s conditions",
    ", we immediately obtain the following expression for @xmath128 , @xmath154 which is the required form given in eq.([newresult ] ) .",
    "the expression for @xmath155 is simply the complex conjugate of the case just considered .",
    "the remaining cases can be verified in an equivalent method considered in this appendix .",
