    "the clump of core - helium burning stars is a prominent feature in the colour - magnitude diagrams of open clusters .",
    "cannon ( 1970 ) predicted that the red clump stars should also be abundant in the solar neighbourhood .",
    "many photometric studies have tried with varying success to identify such stars in the galactic field ( see tautvaiien 1996 for a review ) , however we had to wait for the _ hipparcos _ mission .",
    "the presence of red clump stars in the solar neighbourhood was clearly demonstrated in the hr diagrams by perryman et al .",
    "the _ hipparcos _ catalogue ( perryman et al .",
    "1997 ) contains about 600 clump stars with parallax error lower than 10% , and hence an error in absolute magnitude lower than 0.12 mag .",
    "this accuracy limit corresponds to a distance of about 125  pc within which the sample of clump stars is complete .",
    "now it is important to investigate their distributions of masses , ages , colours , magnitudes and metallicities , which may provide useful constraints to chemical evolution models of the local galactic disk .",
    "moreover , clump stars may be useful indicators of ages and distances for stellar clusters and the local group galaxies ( cf . hatzidimitriou & hawkins 1989 , hatzidimitriou 1991 , udalski 1998 , girardi & salaris 2001 ) .",
    "in this paper we report on the primary atmospheric parameters and the abundances of iron group elements in the 62 clump stars of the galactic field obtained from the high - resolution spectra .",
    "the results are discussed in detail together with results of other studies of the clump stars .",
    "preliminary results of this study were published by tautvaiien et al .",

    "the sample of 63 stars investigated in our study is indicated by open circles .",
    "the red clump stars were selected from the _ hipparcos _ catalogue ( perryman et al .",

    "spectra for 17 stars were obtained at the nordic optical telescope ( not , la palma ) with the sofin chelle spectrograph ( tuominen et al .",
    "1999 ) . the 2nd optical camera ( @xmath8 ) was used to observe simultaneously 13 spectral orders , each of @xmath9   in length , located from 5650   to 8130   .",

    "a th - ar comparison spectrum was used for the wavelength calibration .",
    "the continuum was defined from a number of narrow spectral regions , selected to be free of lines .",
    "the spectra of 14 stars were observed with the hires spectrograph on the 10-m keck telescope . a 1.1 x 7 arcsec slit ( @xmath10 )",
    "was used , and 19 spectral orders located from 5620 to 7860   were extracted .",
    "the spectra were reduced using _ iraf _ and _ makee _ packages .",

    "( 1982 ) was used to rectify them .",
    "the scattered light was removed during the extraction procedure by the program _ ccdspec _ described in gullivier & hill ( 2002 ) .",
    "the spectra for 18 stars in the spectral interval from 6220   to 6270   were obtained at the elginfield observatory ( canada ) with the 1.2  m telescope and the high - resolution coud spectrograph ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "spectra were recorded using an 1872 diode reticon self - scanned array light detector , mounted in a schmidt camera , with focal length of 559 mm .",
    "see brown et al .",
    "( 2008 ) for further discussion concerning the equipment and operation .",
    "this observational data was supplemented by spectroscopic observations ( @xmath13 ) of red clump stars obtained on the 2.16  m telescope of the beijing astronomical observatory ( china ) taken from the literature ( zhao et al .",
    "2001 ) .    in fig .  2",
    ", we show examples of observed spectra for several common stars using different instruments",
    ". a careful selection of spectral lines for the analysis has allowed us to avoid systematic differences in analysis results obtained from the different instruments .",
    "e.g. , the star hd  216228 has been observed on four telescopes , a comparison of the measured equivalent widths ( ew ) of its fei lines is shown in fig .",
    "the spectra were analysed using a differential model atmosphere technique .",
    "the programme packages , developed at the uppsala astronomical observatory , were used to calculate the theoretical equivalent widths and the line profiles .",
    "a set of plane parallel , line - blanketed , constant - flux lte model atmospheres was computed with an updated version of the _ marcs _ code ( gustafsson et al .",
    "2003 ) .    the vienna atomic line data base ( vald , piskunov et al .",
    "1995 ) was extensively used in preparing the input data for the calculations .",
    "atomic oscillator strengths for the spectral lines analysed this study were taken from an inverse solar spectrum analysis done in kiev ( gurtovenko & kostik 1989 ) .",
    "because of the asymmetric nature of line measurement errors ( i.e. problems such as blending and telluric line superposition always increase measured line width ) , we used a `` quality over quantity '' approach when selecting lines for abundance calculations .",
    "all lines used for calculations were carefully selected . inspection of the solar spectrum ( kurucz et al .",
    "1984 ) and the solar line identifications of moore et al .",
    "( 1966 ) were used to avoid blends and lines blended by telluric absorption lines .",
    "all line profiles in all spectra were hand - checked requiring that the line profiles be sufficiently clean to provide reliable equivalent widths . only lines with equivalent widths between 20  m and 150  m were used for abundance determinations .",
    "spectral lines systematically producing outlier abundances in a number of stars , indicating spectral ( observational ) defect , undetected blends or erroneous atomic data , were rejected as well .",
    "the equivalent widths of the lines were measured by fitting of a gaussian profile using the _ 4a _ software package ( ilyin 2000 ) .",
    "effective temperature , gravity and microturbulence were derived using traditional spectroscopic criteria .",
    "the preliminary effective temperatures for the stars were determined using the @xmath14 and @xmath15 colour indices and the temperature calibrations by alonso et al .",
    "for some stars the averaged temperatures also include the values obtained from the infrared flux method ( irfm ) .",
    "all the effective temperatures were carefully checked and corrected if needed by forcing fe  i lines to yield no dependency of iron abundance on excitation potential by changing the model effective temperature .",
    "surface gravity was obtained by forcing fe  i and fe  ii lines to yield the same [ fe / h ] value by adjusting the model gravity .",
    "microturbulence value corresponding to minimal line - to - line fe  i abundance scattering was chosen as correct value .",
    "depending upon the telescope , the number of fe  i lines analysed was up to 65 and of fe  ii up to 12 .",
    "epsf    =    epsf    =    using the @xmath16 values and solar equivalent widths of analysed lines from gurtovenko & kostik ( 1989 ) we obtained the solar abundances , used later for the differential determination of abundances in the programme stars .",
    "we used the solar model atmosphere from the set calculated in uppsala with a microturbulent velocity of 0.8  @xmath17 , as derived from fe  i lines .",
    "in addition to thermal and microturbulent doppler broadening of lines , atomic line broadening by radiation damping and van der waals damping were considered in the calculation of abundances .",
    "radiation damping parameters of lines were taken from the vald database . in most cases",
    "the hydrogen pressure damping of metal lines was treated using the modern quantum mechanical calculations by anstee & omara ( 1995 ) , barklem & omara ( 1997 ) and barklem et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . when using the unsld ( 1955 ) approximation , correction factors to the",
    "classical van der waals damping approximation by widths @xmath18 were taken from simmons & blackwell ( 1982 ) .",
    "for all other species a correction factor of 2.5 was applied to the classical @xmath19 @xmath20 ) , following mckle et al .",
    "( 1975 ) . for lines stronger than @xmath21  m",
    "the correction factors were selected individually by inspection of the solar spectrum .",
    "cobalt abundances were investigated with hyperfine structure ( hfs ) effects taken into account .",
    "the hfs corrections for every line in every star we calculated with the lte spectral synthesis program _ moog _ ( sneden 1973 ) and the hfs input data adopted from prochaska et al .  ( 2000 ) .",
    "the sources of uncertainty can be divided into two distinct categories .",
    "the first category includes the errors that affect a single line ( e.g.  random errors in equivalent widths , oscillator strengths ) , i.e.  uncertainties of the line parameters .",
    "other sources of observational error , such as continuum placement or background subtraction problems also are partly included in the equivalent width uncertainties .",
    "the second category includes the errors which affect all the lines together , i.e.  mainly the model errors ( such as errors in the effective temperature , surface gravity , microturbulent velocity , etc . ) .",
    "the scatter of the deduced line abundances @xmath22 , presented in table  2 and table  3 , gives an estimate of the uncertainty due to the random errors in the line parameters ( the mean value of @xmath22 is @xmath23 ) .",
    "thus the uncertainties in the derived abundances that are the result of random errors amount to approximately this value .",
    "typical internal error estimates for the atmospheric parameters are : @xmath24  k for @xmath25 , @xmath26  dex for log  @xmath27 and @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "the sensitivity of the abundance estimates to changes in the atmospheric parameters by the assumed errors is illustrated for the star hd  218031 in table  1 .",
    "it is seen that possible parameter errors do not affect the abundances seriously ; the element - to - iron ratios , for which we use the neutral species for both and use in our discussion , are even less sensitive .",
