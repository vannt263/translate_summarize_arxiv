    "the statistics of ` recurrence times ' , defined as the random durations of time intervals between two consequent events , is widely used to characterize systems punctuated by short - duration occurrences interspersed between quiet phases .",
    "for instance , the statistics of recurrence times between earthquakes is the basis for hazard assessment in seismology .",
    "the statistics of recurrence times has recently been the focus of researchers interested in the properties of different natural @xcite and social systems @xcite .",
    "the study of recurrence between earthquakes is perhaps the most advanced quantitatively due to the availability of data and the high involved stakes .",
    "the statistics of earthquake recurrence times in large geographic domains have been reported to be characterized by universal intermediate power law asymptotics , both for single homogeneous regions @xcite and when averaged over multiple regions @xcite .",
    "these intermediate power laws , as well as the scaling properties of the distribution of recurrence times , were theoretically explained by the present authors @xcite , using the parsimonious etas model of earthquakes triggering @xcite , which is presently the benchmark model in statistical seismology .",
    "we recall that the acronym etas stands for epidemic - type aftershocks and the etas model is an incarnation of the hawkes self - excited conditional poisson process @xcite . our previous works @xcite have shown that one does not need to invoke new universal laws or fancy scaling in order to explain quantitatively with high accuracy the previously reported scaling laws @xcite .",
    "in other words , the finding reported in @xcite do not contain evidence for any new physics / geophysics laws but constitute just a reformulation of the following laws :    * earthquakes tend to trigger other earthquakes according to the same triggering mechanism , independently of their magnitudes . *",
    "the omori - utsu law for aftershocks , generalized into the phenomenon of earthquake triggering where all earthquakes are treated on the same footing , states that the rate of events that are triggered by a preceding event that occurred at time @xmath13 decays as @xmath14 the function @xmath15 can also be interpreted as the probability density function ( pdf ) of the durations of the waiting time intervals between the reference `` mother '' event and the triggered events of first generation corresponding to direct triggered by the mother event .",
    "the constant @xmath16 describes a characteristic microscopic time scale of the generalized omori law that ensures regularization at small time and normalization .",
    "our previous analytical derivations @xcite , found in excellent agreement with empirical data @xcite , was essentially based on the long - memory of the omori law ( [ omorilawexpr ] ) , @xmath17 for large @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "however , it did not take into account the impact of heterogenous fertilities , which come in wildly varying values .",
    "indeed , the number of daughters triggered by an earthquake of a given magnitude grows exponentially with its magnitude .",
    "for instance , a magnitude 8-earthquake may have tens of thousands of aftershocks of magnitude larger than 2 while a magnitude 2-earthquake may generate no more than 0.1 earthquake on average of magnitude larger than 2 @xcite .",
    "given the fact that the distribution of magnitudes is itself an exponentially decaying function of magnitudes ( called the gutenberg - richter law ) , this translates into a heavy tail distribution of fertilities @xcite , i.e. the distribution of the number of first generation events triggered by a given event has the following power law asymptotic : @xmath20 precisely , @xmath21 is the probability that the random number @xmath22 of first generation aftershocks triggered independently by a given mother event is equal to a given integer @xmath23 .",
    "in fact , the main approximation in our previous work @xcite was to consider that , for the estimation of the distribution of recurrence times , it is sufficient to assume that each mother event triggers at most one event , so that the power law is completely irrelevant .",
    "this surprising approximation was justified by the focus on the tail of the distribution of recurrence times , for which typically only one event , among the set of events triggered by a given earthquake , does contribute .",
    "the goal of the present paper is to reexamine this approximation and present an exact analysis of the impact of the power law form of the distribution of fertilities on the distribution of the recurrence times . to make the analysis feasible and exact , we consider the case where the omori law is no more heavy - tailed but has a shorter memory in the form of an exponential distribution , expressed by a suitable choice of time units in the form @xmath24 in addition to getting exact analytical expressions , our study of the case of an exponential memory kernel ( [ expdisdef ] ) is motivated by the fact that , for many applications , this is the default assumption @xcite",
    "therefore , this parameterization has an genuine interest and intrinsic value .",
    "this exponential memory function should not be confused with the poisson model , which has no memory .",
    "in contrast , the hawkes process takes into account the full set of interactions between all past events and the future events , mediated by the influence function given by @xmath15 .",
    "the main result of the present paper is the exact expression for the full distribution @xmath25 of recurrence times that results from all the possible cascades of triggering of events over all generations .",
    "we make explicit the substantial dependence of the power law exponents characterizing the distribution @xmath25 on the exponent @xmath0 of the power law tail for the distribution of fertilities and on the branching ratio @xmath26 , defined as the mean number of events of first generation triggered per event : @xmath27 ~. \\label{wryjujiuk}\\ ] ]    the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section 2 present the self - excited conditional hawkes poisson process and the main exact equations obtained using generating probability functions .",
    "section 3 studies the probability of quiescence within a given fixed time interval and derives different statistical properties of earthquake clusters , such as the mean number of earthquakes in clusters and their mean duration .",
    "section 4 presents the main results concerning the probability density functions ( pdf ) of the waiting times between successive earthquakes .",
    "section 5 summarizes our main results and concludes .",
    "the appendix makes more specific the analytical model used in our derivations and describes useful statistical properties of first generation aftershocks .",
    "while we use the language of seismology and events are named ` earthquakes ' , our results obviously apply to the many natural and social - economic - financial systems in which self - excitation occurs .",
    "before discussing the statistical properties of recurrence times , let us develop the statistical description of the random number of earthquakes occurring within the time window @xmath28 .",
    "the hawkes model that we consider assumes that there are exogenous events ( called `` immigrants '' in the literature on branching processes , or `` noise events '' ) , occurring spontaneously according to a poissonian stationary flow statistics .",
    "thus , successive instants @xmath29 of the noise earthquakes belong to the stationary poisson point process with mean rate @xmath30 .",
    "then , the hawkes model assumes that any given noise earthquake , occurring at @xmath31 , triggers a total of @xmath32 first generation earthquakes .",
    "we assume that the set of the total numbers @xmath33 of first generation aftershocks triggered by noise earthquakes are iid random integers , with the same generating probability function ( gpf ) @xmath34 .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of waiting times @xmath18 between the time @xmath35 of a given noise earthquake and the occurrences of its aftershocks is assumed to be @xmath15 defined by expression ( [ expdisdef ] ) . in turn , each of the aftershocks of first generation triggered by a given noise earthquake also triggers independently its own first generation aftershocks , with the same statistical properties ( same gpf ) as the first generation aftershocks .",
    "specifically , the hawkes self - excited conditional poisson process is defined by the following form of the intensity function @xmath36 where the history @xmath37 includes all events that occurred before the present time @xmath18 and the sum in expression ( [ hyjuetg2tgj ] ) runs over all past triggered events .",
    "the set of parameters is denoted by the symbol @xmath38 .",
    "the term @xmath39 means that there are some external noise ( or immigrant , exogenous ) sources occurring according to a poisson process with intensity @xmath39 , which may be a function of time , but all other events can be both triggered by previous events and can themselves trigger their offsprings .",
    "this gives rise to the existence of many generations of events . in the sequel",
    ", we will consider only the case where @xmath40 is constant .    under the above definitions and assumptions",
    ", one can prove that the gpf of the total number of all earthquakes ( including noise and triggered events of all generations ) occurring within the time window @xmath28 can be expressed as a product of two terms : @xmath41 the first term @xmath42 is the gpf of the number of all earthquakes in @xmath28 triggered by noise and triggered earthquakes that occurred up to time @xmath18 .",
