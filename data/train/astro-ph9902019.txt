    "the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in clusters of galaxies is known to possess magnetic fields whose origin and properties are not yet well known .",
    "the presence of cluster magnetic fields is demonstrated by a ) the existence of diffuse cluster - wide radio emission ( radio halo ) as revealed in some clusters ( e.g. coma , see giovannini et al .",
    "1993 , and references therein ) , b ) the detection of inverse compton hard x - ray emission ( bagchi et al .",
    "1998 , fusco - femiano et al . 1998 ) , c ) the study of variations of the faraday rotation of background sources shining through different lines of sight across the clusters , d ) the analysis of faraday rotation gradients in extended sources embedded within the cluster .",
    "kim et al . ( 1991 ) analyzed the rotation measure ( rm ) of radio sources in a sample of abell clusters and found that @xmath0 g level fields are widespread in the icm , regardless whether they do or do not have a strong radio halo .",
    "stronger magnetic fields , from about 5 up to the extreme value of 30 @xmath0 g ( as in 3c  295 , perley & taylor 1991 ; and hydra a , taylor & perley 1993 ) have been found in `` cooling flow '' clusters where extremely large faraday rotations have been revealed , suggesting that the generation of very strong icm magnetic fields may be connected with the cooling flow process ( soker & sarazin 1990 , godon et al . 1998 ) . in the coma cluster , a magnetic field of about 6@xmath1",
    "@xmath0 g was found by feretti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) from the analysis of the rotation measure in the cluster radio galaxy ngc  4869 .",
    "this large value is comparable to the magnetic field strength observed in cooling flow clusters , and it is considerably larger than the `` equipartition '' field derived by the radio data of the diffuse radio halo coma c , permeating the coma cluster center .",
    "the icm magnetic field can be tangled on scales much smaller than the typical galaxy size .",
    "crusius - wtzel et al .",
    "( 1990 ) , studying the depolarization in 5 strong double sources , found tangling on smaller scales ( 1 - 4 kpc ) .",
    "this is confirmed by the results of feretti et al .",
    "( 1995 ) on the coma cluster .",
    "the knowledge of the properties of the large - scale magnetic fields in clusters is important to study the cluster formation and evolution , and has significant implications for primordial star formation ( pudritz & silk 1989 ) .",
    "it has been suggested that strong fields can originate either by large scale dynamo amplification ( ruzmaikin 1989 ) or by turbulence following a cluster merger ( tribble 1993 ) .",
    "these magnetic fields can be traced by studying the rotation measures of radio sources located within or behind the cluster .    [ cols= \" <",

    "column 1 : source name ; column 2 : maximum absolute value of rm ; column 3 : average value of rm ; column 4 : rm dispersion ; column 5 : average depolarization defined as m@xmath2/m@xmath3 ; column 6 : distance from the cluster center in units of core radii .    in the case of a tangled magnetic field , with cells of uniform size , same strength , and random orientation ,",
    "the observed rm along any given line of sight will be generated by a random walk process , and the distribution of rm results in a gaussian with zero mean , and the dispersion related to the number of cells along the line of sight .",
    "the source will also depolarize at long wavelength , if the external faraday screen is not fully resolved by the observing beam .",
    "the good @xmath4 fits to the polarization angle favour the interpretation that external faraday rotation is the dominant mechanism in the present sources . in table",
    "[ polar ] we summarize the results for the present radio galaxies .",
    "the most striking result is the trend of rm dispersion and depolarization with distance from the cluster center .",
    "the innermost source , 0053 - 015 , has the largest @xmath5 , the highest absolute values of rm , and the highest depolarization at long wavelengths .",
    "the source 0053 - 016 , located just beyond 1 core radius from the cluster center , still shows high values of rm , but lower than in 0053 - 015 , and also the depolarization is lower .",
    "finally , the peripheral source 3c  29 shows little rm and little depolarization .",
    "this result points to the interpretation that the external faraday screen is the same for all 3 sources , i.e. it is the intergalactic medium in a  119 , which plays different roles according to how much magneto - ionized medium is crossed by the polarized emission .",
    "this is consistent with the two nat s being really located in the inner cluster region , and not simply projected onto it . as suggested by tribble ( 1991 ) , unresolved external rm fluctuations produce a fall - off of the polarization degree with @xmath6 .",
    "a consistent picture is thus that the structure of the intergalactic magnetic field is tangled on small scales , this accounting for the observed depolarization . from the polarization degree of 0053 - 015 and 0053 - 016 ( see sect .",
    "3 ) , there is evidence that the 3.5   observing beam does not fully resolve the screen .",
    "thus , we can argue that the scale of tangling of the magnetic field is @xmath74 kpc .",
    "moreover , field reversals must take place .",
    "the indirect detection of the magnetic field associated with the intergalactic medium of a  119 is an important result , since so far a significant intergalactic magnetic field has been only found at the center of clusters with strong cooling flows ( ge & owen 1993 , taylor et al .",
    "1994 ) . moreover , direct evidence of a cluster magnetic field is provided in the few clusters containing a radio halo ( see e.g. feretti & giovannini 1996 ) .",
    "the magnetic field present in a  119 is spread on a size larger at least than one cluster core radius .",
    "the existence of a magnetic field component in the intergalactic medium therefore seems to be a common feature in clusters of galaxies .",
    "the determination of the strength of the magnetic field in a  119 depends on the model for the x - ray gas distribution and on several assumptions , including the rm structure function , and the field structure .    in the simplest case that a constant magnetic field fills the whole cluster , using the central gas density and a core radius as the path - length , eq .",
    "( 2 ) requires @xmath8 = 1.2 @xmath0 g .",
    "we have found , however , that the magnetic field is likely to be tangled on scales of the order of a few kpc . in this case , the intensity of magnetic field is larger by the square root of the number of cells crossed by the line of sight .    a more realistic approach is to assume a magnetic field in randomly oriented cells of uniform size and strength , and a gas density distribution given by the hydrostatic isothermal model .",
    "the gas density @xmath9 has the functional form @xmath10 where the parameters have the same meaning as in eq .",
    "( 1 ) . in this case",
    ", the rm dispersion at different projected distance from the cluster center was evaluated by felten ( 1996 ) by solving the integral of eq .",
    "( 2 ) : @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gamma function , @xmath13 is the core radius in kpc , and @xmath14 is the size of each cell in kpc ; the central gas density @xmath15 is in @xmath16 and @xmath8 is in @xmath0 g .",
    "the constant @xmath17 depends on the integration path over the gas density distribution : @xmath17 = 624 , if the source lies completely beyond the cluster , and @xmath17 = 441 if it is as distant from the observer as the cluster center . for the cluster a  119 ,",
    "using @xmath17 = 441 and the gas parameters given in table [ clusd ] , the previous formula becomes @xmath18 the values of @xmath5 obtained for the 2 nat s of a  119 fit fairly well in the model described above and are consistent with a magnetic field strength in the range 9.6 - 13.6 @xmath0 g , for a cell size between 2 and 4 kpc .",
    "the rm of the peripheral source 3c  29 is also consistent with the previous model .",
    "however , the magnetic field probably can not be constant over 4 core radii ( @xmath19 1.5 mpc ) , otherwise the magnetic pressure would exceed the thermal pressure in the outer parts of the cluster .",
    "so it is reasonable to believe that the very low rm of 3c  29 derives not only from the low density of the foreground medium , but also from a weaker magnetic field in this region .",
    "the model used to derive the magnetic field strength is very simplified : first , the two radio galaxies can be at different locations along the line of sight ; second , the cluster shows possible substructures both in optical and in x - rays , and therefore the model used for the gas density distribution may be inaccurate ; third , the magnetic field structure could be more complicated than assumed .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that the cell size of the magnetic field in the region around the radio galaxies would be smaller than that of the the cluster - wide magnetic field , due to the interaction between the radio sources themselves and the intergalactic medium . with cells of 10 - 20 kpc , the magnetic field derived from eq .",
    "( 5 ) is 4.5 - 6.1 @xmath0 g .    even allowing for the uncertainties related to the previous computations , the observational evidence favours the existence of a strong magnetic field in the intergalactic medium of a  119 , over a scale larger than the cluster core radius .",
    "a plausible range for the magnetic field strength is about 5 - 10 @xmath0 g .",
    "three radio galaxies belonging to the cluster abell 119 , located at different projected distance from the cluster center , are studied in total intensity and polarization .",
    "the two radio galaxies closer to the cluster center show similar nat structure , while the most peripheral radio galaxy is a classical fri source .",
    "the spectra of the nat radio galaxies progressively steepen with the distance , as expected under the effect of synchrotron energy losses .",
    "the electron lifetimes inferred from the spectral curvature lead to drift velocities of @xmath194000 - 4500 km s@xmath20 .",
    "still higher values are obtained if the magnetic field is different from the equipartion value .",
    "such large values of the velocities can derive from projection effects , or from the existence of reacceleration processes within the tails , or bulk motions along the tails and/or in the integalactic medium .",
    "we also note that non - uniformities in the magnetic field can affect the interpretation of the spectral curvature .",
    "large faraday rotations are found in the nat s .",
    "the magnitude and scale of the rm is consistent with a magnetic field embedded in the hot x - ray emitting cluster medium . to account for the observed faraday rotation",
    ", the cluster magnetic field must be present up to a distance of more than 1 cluster core radius .",
    "the strength of the field is between 5 and 10 @xmath0 g , depending on the scale of the magnetic field tangling .",
