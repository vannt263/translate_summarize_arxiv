    "<S> the kondo effect shows up as additional maximum appearing in conductance @xmath37 quantum dot when the temperature decreases . </S>",
    "<S> it is connected with the abrikosov - suhl resonance ( resonances ) in the density of states , which appears ( appear ) at low temperatures and is ( are ) located at the position(s ) of the fermi level of the leads in ( non)equilibrium situation . </S>",
    "<S> the slope of conductance thus changes and the thermopower changes sign . </S>",
    "<S> thermopower measured directly and obtained from the mott formula differ in line shapes @xcite and this calls for the discussion of the validity of mott formula @xcite in the interacting quantum dot systems . </S>",

    "<S> the abrikosov - suhl resonance splits ( as in external b field @xcite ) and this results in decrease of low temperature s ( fig . </S>",
