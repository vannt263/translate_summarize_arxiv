    "we will work with a vector space that allows theoretical access to the evolution of a system at multiple times .",
    "this vector space is called the history hilbert space @xmath1 , and is defined by the tensor product from right to left of the admissible hilbert spaces of our system at sequential times . explicitly , for @xmath2 times",
    "@xmath3 , we have @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the admissible hilbert space at time @xmath6 . restricting the admissible hilbert spaces @xmath7 and @xmath8 corresponds to pre- and post - selection respectively .    in this paper , we will be primarily concerned with history hilbert spaces defined over a discrete set of times .",
    "it is possible to work with history hilbert spaces over a continuum of times , but doing so requires the full apparatus of the farhi - gutmann path integral @xcite .",
    "the history hilbert space @xmath1 is also equipped with bridging operators @xmath9 , where @xmath10 .",
    "these bridging operators encode unitary time evolution .",
    "we would like to define a mathematical object that encodes the evolution of our system through time  a notion of quantum state for history space  in a way that supports an inner product and probability interpretation .",
    "one might at first think that an element of @xmath1 , such as @xmath11 would be the appropriate mathematical object , but a different concept , which removes awkward phases , appears more fruitful . for us ,",
    "history states are elements of the linear space @xmath12 spanned by projectors from @xmath13 .",
    "henceforth , we will call @xmath12 the history state space .    for example , if @xmath1 is the history space of a spin-1/2 particle at three times @xmath14 , then an example history state ( in history _ state _ space ) is @xmath15 \\odot [ x^+ ] \\odot [ z^+]\\ ] ] where we use the notation @xmath16 : = |z^+\\rangle \\langle z^+|$ ] . the history state in eqn.([simpleststate ] ) can be considered as a quantum trajectory : the particle is spin up in the @xmath17-direction at time @xmath18 , spin - up in the @xmath19-direction at time @xmath20 , and spin - down in the @xmath17-direction at time @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath12 is a complex vector space , another example of a history state is @xmath22 \\odot [ x^+ ] \\odot [ z^+ ]   + \\beta \\ , [ z^+ ] \\odot [ x^- ] \\odot [ z^+]\\ ] ] for complex coefficients @xmath23 and @xmath24 . the history state in eqn.([simplesuperposition ] ) is a superposition of the history states @xmath25 \\odot [ x^+ ] \\odot [ z^+]$ ] and @xmath16 \\odot [ x^- ] \\odot [ z^+]$ ] .",
    "it can be interpreted as meaning that the particle takes _ both _ quantum trajectories , but with different amplitudes .",
    "precise physical interpretation of history states like the one in eqn.([simplesuperposition ] ) requires more structure .",
    "for example , it is not obviously true ( and usually is false ) that one can measure the particle to take the trajectory @xmath25 \\odot [ x^+ ] \\odot [ z^+]$ ] with probability proportional to @xmath26 , or the other trajectory with probability proportional to @xmath27 . to discuss probabilities ,",
    "generalizing the born rule , we need an inner product .",
    "furthermore , we have not yet defined which mathematical objects correspond to measurable quantities .    for a history space @xmath1 with @xmath2 times @xmath28",
    ", a general history state takes the form @xmath29 \\odot \\cdots \\odot [ a_i(t_1)]\\ ] ] where each @xmath30 $ ] is a one - dimensional projector @xmath30 : \\mathcal{h}_{t_j } \\to \\mathcal{h}_{t_j}$ ] , and @xmath31 .",
    "we have decorated the history state with a soft ket @xmath32 which is suggestive of a wave function . in our theory ,",
    "a history state is the natural generalization of a wave function , and has similar algebraic properties .",
    "note that such sums of products of projectors will also accommodate products of hermitian operators more generally .",
    "in defining a physically appropriate inner product between history states the @xmath33 operator or  chain operator \" @xcite defined by @xmath34 \\odot \\cdots \\odot [ a_i(t_1 ) ] ) \\\\ & = \\sum_{i } \\alpha_i [ a_i(t_n ) ] t(t_{n},t_{n-1 } ) [ a_i(t_{n-1 } ) ] \\cdots [ a_i(t_2 ) ] t(t_2 , t_1 ) [ a_i(t_1)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath9 is the bridging operator associated with the history space , plays a central role .",
    "note that @xmath33 maps a history state in @xmath12 to an operator which takes @xmath35 .    using the @xmath33 operator ,",
    "we equip history states with the positive semi - definite inner product @xcite @xmath36\\ ] ] this inner product induces a semi - norm on history states , and we call @xmath37 the _ weight _ of @xmath38 .",
    "it reflects the probability of @xmath38 occurring .",
    "note that the inner product is degenerate , in the sense that @xmath39 does not imply that @xmath40 .",
    "we say that a history state @xmath38 is normalized if @xmath41 . if @xmath38 has non - zero weight , then @xmath42 is normalized .",
    "we will use this bar notation throughout the rest of the paper .    at this point",
    "an example may be welcome . if @xmath1 is the history space of a spin-1/2 particle at three times @xmath43 equipped with a trivial bridging operator @xmath44 , then @xmath45 \\odot [ x^+ ] \\odot [ z^+ ] \\right ) = \\frac{1}{2 } \\ , |z^-\\rangle \\langle z^+|\\ ] ] let us interpret the factor of @xmath46 on the right - hand side of the above equation . since the bridging operator for the history space is the identity , any particle which is spin - up in the @xmath17-direction at time @xmath18 will continue to be in that state at times @xmath20 and @xmath21 . however , the history state in equation is @xmath25 \\odot [ x^+ ] \\odot [ z^+]$ ] , which does not follow the unitary evolution imposed by the bridging operator . that deviation comes at a cost , which is the amplitude @xmath46 . in general , as we will see , histories which do not follow unitary evolution have a reduced probability of being measured , with the suppression factor proportional to the absolute square of the coefficient generated by the @xmath33 operator . in equation ,",
    "the suppression is a factor of @xmath47",
    ".      we will be interested in subspaces that both admit an orthogonal basis ( possibly including history states of zero norm ) and contain the complete history state @xmath48 ( which corresponds to a system being in a superposition of all possible states at each time ) .",
    "the orthogonal set of history states which spans such a subspace will be called a _ family _ of history states . more formally : + * definition * _ we say _",
    "@xmath49 _ is a family of history states if _ + ( 1 ) @xmath50 _ for _ @xmath51 _ and _ @xmath52 , _ and _ + ( 2 ) @xmath53 _ for some complex _ @xmath54 .",
    "+   + requirement ( 1 ) is griffiths  strong consistent histories condition \" @xcite-@xcite .",
    "contrary to earlier work , we see no reason to impose the requirement that history states , regarded as operators , commute .",
    "it is not essential that history states commute since they are not themselves observables .",
    "however , projectors of the form @xmath55 _ are _ observables . by orthogonality ,",
    "@xmath56 = 0 $ ] for all @xmath57 , so commutativity of the corresponding observables is automatic .",
    "we also remark that a family of history states contains at most @xmath58 history states with non - zero norm @xcite .",
    "now let us work through an example .",
    "let us consider again the history space of a spin-1/2 particle at three times @xmath43 equipped with a trivial bridging operator . according to our definition , @xmath59 .",
    "one such history state is @xmath60 \\odot [ z^+ ]",
    "\\odot [ z^+]$ ] , which can be written as latexmath:[\\[\\label{histsup1 }    equation implies that a state which at time @xmath18 is spin up in the @xmath17-direction and evolves in time by the trivial bridging operator can be measured to be the history @xmath62 with probability @xmath63 , or the history @xmath64 with probability @xmath63 .",
    "later we will outline how to make such a measurement .",
    "another interesting history state in @xmath65 is @xmath66 which is normalized if @xmath67 . the history state @xmath68 is itself an entangled quantum trajectory .",
    "we will argue that such objects , which might appear exotic , govern concrete measurements .",
    "having provided several examples of history states , we will now briefly discuss operators on histories .",
    "we also consider operators @xmath69 which are linear maps from history states to history states .",
    "in general , any operator of the form @xmath70 \\odot \\cdots \\odot [ \\psi(t_1 ) ] \\longmapsto",
    "\\sum_i \\alpha_i a_i^{t_n } [ \\psi(t_n)](a_i^{t_n})^\\dagger \\odot \\cdots \\odot a_i^{t_1 } [ \\psi(t_1 ) ] ( a_i^{t_1})^\\dagger\\ ] ] where all @xmath71 are linear operators , is a linear operator on history state space .    as in standard quantum theory , not all operators correspond to observables .",
    "history state operators that correspond to observables are those which are both hermitian , and whose eigenvectors can be extended to define a family .",
    "recall that the latter condition includes the consistent histories condition .",
    "this requirement , which appears necessary for a sensible interpretation of probabilities , excludes many hermitian operators .",
    "for example , given a family of history states @xmath49 , all history state operators of the form @xmath72 for @xmath73 correspond to observables .",
    "a measurement of the normalized history state @xmath74 by the observable @xmath75 gives the result @xmath76 with probability @xmath77 ( or , for degenerate eigenvalues , the appropriate sum over such terms ) .",
    "similar to standard quantum theory , an eigenvalue @xmath76 can be thought of as the readout of a detector which implements the observable @xmath75 and measures a history state to be @xmath78 .",
    "for another example , consider the history space of a spin-1/2 particle at two times @xmath79 equipped with a trivial bridging operator .",
    "we will consider the operator @xmath80 which induces a linear map on history states by @xmath81 \\sigma_y^\\dagger \\odot   \\sigma_x [ \\psi(t_1 ) ] \\sigma_x^\\dagger\\ ] ] the @xmath82 operator corresponds to measuring the spin-1/2 particle at time @xmath18 in the @xmath19-basis , and then measuring at time @xmath20 in the @xmath83-basis .",
    "the eigenhistory states of @xmath82 form a family , namely @xmath84\\odot[x^{\\pm}]\\}$ ] which are the history state  outputs \" of the sequence of measurements . more generically ,",
    "if our history space has a larger number of times , the linear map on history states induced by @xmath85 corresponds to measuring at some particular time in the @xmath19-basis followed by measuring at some later time in the @xmath83-basis .",
    "we see that measurements at one or more times give rise to families of history states in which the history states are eigenstates of observables ( in the traditional sense ) at specified times .",
    "new features appear when we consider more elaborate sets of history observables .",
    "consider again a spin-1/2 particle at two times @xmath79 equipped with a trivial bridging operator .",
    "in addition to @xmath80 , we will also consider @xmath86 which induces a linear map on history states by @xmath87 \\sigma_x^\\dagger \\odot   \\sigma_z [ \\psi(t_1 ) ] \\sigma_z^\\dagger\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the restrictions of @xmath80 and @xmath86 to either @xmath18 or @xmath20 do _ not _ commute .",
    "however , @xmath86 and @xmath88 themselves _ do _ commute , which reflects their non - trivial temporal structure .",
    "thus , @xmath86 and @xmath88 have simultaneous eigenvectors , and correspondingly @xmath82 and @xmath89 have simultaneous eigenhistory states which in fact form a family .",
    "the simultaneous eigenvectors of @xmath80 and @xmath86 are latexmath:[\\ ] ] measuring @xmath115 at time @xmath107 corresponds to measuring the history state @xmath116 and likewise @xmath117 corresponds to history state @xmath118    note that equations and together form a family of history states for the mach - zehnder system .",
    "it is a linear transformation of our original @xmath119 family .",
    "if two families of history states are related by a linear transformation , we say that they are compatible .",
    "as demonstrated in the example above , compatible families have the nice feature that you can measure a history state in one family , or a history state in the other , using the same auxiliary qubits in different bases .",
    "it is possible to measure a system in differing compatible families sequentially .",
    "for example , say that we want to measure the mach - zehnder system with respect to the @xmath119 family and then by the family described by equations and . to do this ,",
    "we tensor two auxiliary qubits to the initial state of the system , and evolve the system and auxiliary qubits in the same manner as before . at time @xmath107 , we end up with @xmath120 if we measure the first auxiliary qubit in the @xmath111 basis , then the system collapses to either @xmath98 or @xmath99 with equal probability .",
    "if we then measure the second qubit in the basis from equation , the effect is to measure either the history state @xmath98 or the history state @xmath99 in the compatible family described by equations and .",
    "the preceding example illustrates that there are aspects of quantum behavior that are not easy to express in the conventional time - evolution picture .",
    "our theory of history states allows us to manipulate time correlations and time entanglement in a transparent fashion .",
    "a general cnot operator takes the form @xmath121 where @xmath122 is an orthonormal basis for our system of interest at some particular time , and each @xmath123 is a unitary operator that acts on auxiliary qubits .",
    "such cnot operators allow us to  mark \" and  unmark \" histories . by choosing the @xmath123 carefully",
    ", we can use this construction to render the entities we have _ defined _ as history observables to _ be _ observable , concretely .",
    "we need only take care to avoid upsetting the unitary evolution of our system of interest by unwittingly imposing orthogonality relations .      in this section",
    "we consider an extreme example of history entanglement involving two particles .",
    "we will utilize the history space of two spin-1/2 particles at three times @xmath14 , equipped with a trivial bridging operator .",
    "then the history states @xmath124 \\odot [ x^+ , \\textbf{1 } ] \\odot [ z^+ , x^+ ] + 2\\,[z^+ , z^- ] \\odot [ x^+ , \\textbf{1 } ] \\odot [ z^- , x^+]\\ ] ] this history state exhibits  time entanglement \" : measuring the first particle at time @xmath18 does not determine the state of the second particle until time @xmath21 .",
    "we have that the state of particle @xmath125 at time @xmath18 is the same as the state of particle @xmath126 at time @xmath21  behavior in time similar to that which a bell state exhibits in space . using constructions similar to the ones in the previous section ,",
    "it is possible to measure such a history state .",
    "such extreme entanglement exemplifies the possibility of new structures emerging from the quantum theory of history states .",
    "the framework of history states elucidates the temporal structure of quantum theory and makes sense of an expanded class of observables which act on quantum trajectories . using our framework , we are able to understand the past as an entangled superposition of time evolutions which are shaped by the outcome of measurements in the present . to concretely explore temporal entanglement ,",
    "we have constructed examples of entangled history states with non - classical correlations in time which can be experimentally realized .",
    "it would be very interesting to connect these ideas to the mathematical theory of ( classical ) inference and causality , which has matured in recent years @xcite .",
