    "since the pioneering proposal of the existence of isolated quantum mechanical bound states embedded in the continuum , made by von neumann and wigner @xcite in the study of the one - particle schrdinger equation with certain spatially oscillating attractive potentials , several theoretical and a few experimental studies have demonstrated the existence of `` bound states in the continuum '' ( bic ) in a wide range of different physical systems @xcite .",
    "bic may be found in certain atomic or molecular systems @xcite , such as hydrogen atom in a uniform magnetic field @xcite , in semiconductor superlattice structures @xcite , in mesoscopic electron transport and quantum waveguides @xcite , and in quantum dot systems @xcite .",
    "the question of existence of bic has been also addressed for the famous fano - anderson hamiltonian @xcite ( also referred to as the friedrichs - lee hamiltonian @xcite ) , which model the process of quantum mechanical decay of an unstable localized state coupled with a continuum in different contexts such as atomic physics , quantum electrodynamics , solid state and high - energy physics ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "bic in fano - anderson - like models are commonplace in case where _ several _",
    "( i.e. more than one ) discrete states are coupled to a common continuum ; a noteworthy example of this case in condensed - matter physics is provided , for instance , by quantum transport and scattering in dot molecules attached to leads @xcite . in those systems",
    "the existence of bic is usually related to the destruction of discrete - continuum decay channels via quantum interference through a typical trapping mechanism . the conditions for the existence of bic for a general multi - level fano - anderson hamiltonian have been recently stated in ref.@xcite ; in particular , a sufficient condition that ensures the _ non - existence _ of bic has been demonstrated . in case of",
    "a _ single _ localized state embedded in and interacting with a continuum , the existence of bound states ( sometimes referred to as `` dressed bound states '' ) has been acknowledged on many occasions and related to threshold effects or to singularities or gaps in the density of states of the continuum ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "however , such dressed bound states have usually an energy _ outside _ the continuum @xcite : effects such as fractional decay , population trapping and atom - photon bound states found in several physical models describing the decay of a single discrete level coupled to a continuum @xcite are in fact most of the times related to the existence of dressed bound states with an energy _ outside _ the continuum .",
    "conversely , bic have been seldom encountered in the single - level fano - anderson model : examples of bic involving a single localized state coupled with a specially - structured continuum have been found in the study of certain exactly - solvable electrodynamic models of spontaneous emission decay with a density of modes showing a point - like gap @xcite , however physical realizations of such models were not proposed @xcite .",
    "+ it is the aim of this work to present an exactly - solvable fano - anderson hamiltonian with a single discrete level coupled to a continuum by a colored interaction which supports bic .",
    "the proposed model is of physical relevance to certain condensed - matter and photonic systems , since it may describe the charge transfer dynamics of adatoms to a semi - infinite one - dimensional lattice of quantum dots @xcite or photon tunneling dynamics in semi - infinite optical waveguide arrays or coupled optical resonators @xcite within the tight - binding approximation . in these lattice realizations , the tight - binding analysis allows one to simply explain the appearance of bic as a _ boundary effect _ due to truncation of the lattice .",
    "+ the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii , the fano - anderson model describing the coupling of a single localized state with a continuum",
    "is briefly reviewed , and the conditions for the existence of bound states either inside or outside the continuum are presented .",
    "section iii proposes an exactly - solvable model with colored interaction which supports bic ; exact analytical results for the fractional decay induced by bic are also presented . finally , in sec .",
    "iv a lattice realization of the model is presented , together with a simple physical explanation for the existence of bic .",
    "the starting point of the analysis is provided by a standard fano - anderson model describing the interaction of a discrete state @xmath0 , of energy @xmath1 , with a continuum described by a set of continuous states @xmath2 with energy @xmath3 ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the hamiltonian of the interacting system can be written as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the hamiltonian of the non - interacting discrete and continuous states , and @xmath6\\ ] ] is the interaction part .",
    "normalization has been assumed such that @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "if we expand the wave function @xmath10 of the system as @xmath11 , the expansion coefficients @xmath12 and @xmath13 satisfy the coupled - mode equations @xmath14 where the dot indicates the derivative with respect to time .",
    "typically , we assume that the frequency @xmath15 of continuous states spans a finite interval ( a band ) @xmath16 for the allowed values of the continuous variable @xmath17 , and that the frequency @xmath18 of the discrete level is embedded in the continuum , i.e. that @xmath19 .",
    "the eigenstates @xmath20 of @xmath21 corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath22 are obtained from the eigenvalue equation @xmath23 .",
    "after introduction of the density of states @xmath24 , from eqs.(1 ) and ( 2 ) it follows that the eigenfrequencies @xmath25 are found as the eigenvalues of the system @xmath26 where we have set @xmath27 . as the continuous spectrum of @xmath21 is the same as that of @xmath28 , isolated eigenvalues corresponding to bound states may or may not occur for @xmath21 .",
    "the energy @xmath29 corresponds to a bound state of @xmath21 provided that @xmath20 is square integrable .",
    "this implies @xmath30 outside the continuum exists provided that a root of the equation @xmath31 can be found outside the band @xmath32 , where we have set @xmath33 the conditions for the existence of bound states of this kind have been extensively investigated in the literature ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , eq.(8 ) admits always two solutions outside the interval @xmath34 whenever @xmath35 does not vanish at the edge of the band , since in this case @xmath36 diverges to @xmath37 as @xmath38 .",

    "as shown in ref.@xcite , a bound state at frequency @xmath25 inside the continuum may exist provided that the following two conditions are simultaneously satisfied @xmath39 additionally , @xmath40 should vanish as @xmath41 at least as @xmath42 in order to ensure a finite norm [ eq.(7 ) ] .",
    "the first equation in ( 10 ) can be satisfied for either @xmath43 or @xmath44 .",
    "the former case , which corresponds to a point - like gap in the density of states inside the band , has been previously considered for some special density of state profiles @xcite , which however do not seem to have simple physical realizations @xcite .",
    "the latter case , @xmath44 , implies that the discrete state @xmath45 does not interact with the continuous state of frequency @xmath25 , and thus implies a `` colored '' interaction profile @xmath46 with one zero at @xmath47 .",
    "however , at such a frequency the additional condition @xmath48 must be simultaneously satisfied , which means that bic may exist solely at a prescribed energy @xmath1 of the level @xmath0 .",
    "consider now the decay dynamics of the unstable state @xmath0 embedded in the continuum .",
    "this corresponds to solve eqs.(3 ) and ( 4 ) with the initial conditions @xmath49 and @xmath50 , which can be done by e.g. a laplace transformation or a green s function analysis ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",

    "therefore , if the frequency @xmath18 of the discrete level lies inside the interval @xmath95 no bound states outside the continuum do exist . for a given value of @xmath68 , eq.(22 )",

    "such a fractional decay is different from the most common one encountered in other single - level fano - anderson models ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) since in our model the fractional decay is due to the existence of a bic .",
