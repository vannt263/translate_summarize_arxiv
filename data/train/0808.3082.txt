    "in 1995 an effective action @xcite for qcd scattering processes at high center of mass energies has been proposed by l.n .",
    "lipatov which describes the interaction of reggeized gluons with quark- ( @xmath0 ) and gluon-(@xmath1 ) fields local in rapidity .",
    "the action is formulated for the quasi - multi - regge - kinematics ( qmrk ) , where quark and gluon fields build clusters localized in rapidity , while these clusters themselves are ordered strongly in rapidity w.r.t each other .",
    "their overall rapidity is bounded from above and below by the rapidities of the scattering particles which are taken to propagate along opposite light - cone directions @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "interaction between the clusters is mediated by the reggeon fields @xmath4 .",
    "the lagrangian of the effective action is given by @xmath5 light - cone components are defined by @xmath6 . to obtain quantities of interest from the action ,",
    "it is necessary to perform integrations over light - cone degrees of freedom , which in particular requires to find the right prescription for the poles in @xmath7 .",
    "formally these poles are harmless as the action is given for central rapidities , but to obtain reliable results , a solid understanding of these poles and the integration over light - cone components in general is crucial . in order to do so , we first attempt to rederive some well - known results from the action . in the following",
    "we present some first results .",
    "we start with the gluon trajectory . from the feynman rules of the effective action @xcite one obtains @xmath8",
    "comparing this with the corresponding one - loop qcd amplitude in the regge limit , it appears that the poles in @xmath9 and @xmath10 should be interpreted as a principal value i.e. @xmath11 . performing the integral over @xmath10 by closing the contour at infinity one finds @xmath12 where the @xmath9 integral will produce the logarithm in @xmath13 .",
    "next we come to the 2-to-2 reggeon transition kernel ( see fig . [ fig:222ker ] ) which is the real part of the bfkl - kernel . from the effective action one",
    "obtains : @xmath14.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] attempting to perform the integral over @xmath10 by closing the contour at infinity , one faces the problem that the term proportional to @xmath15 is logarithmically divergent .",
    "however , if one symmetrizes in the color labels @xmath16 and @xmath17 , the singularity cancels and the contour can be closed . together with the remaining terms ( where poles in light - cone momenta are interpreted as in section [ sec : traj ] )",
    "one obtains the real ( connected ) part of the bfkl - kernel . in the anti - symmetric case",
    "however , the singularity does not cancel .",
    "instead ( defining @xmath18 ) we face the following integral @xmath19 as the effective theory is formulated for central rapidities , the integration over @xmath20 can be understood as @xmath21 which leads to vanishing of ( [ eq : asympv ] ) .",
    "this might appear surprising from the first sight , as usually the bfkl - kernel with anti - symmetric color configuration is associated with reggeization of the gluon .",
    "however , in the effective theory reggeization is taken into account by resuming contributions like ( [ eq : traj_res ] ) , and therefore vanishing of ( [ eq : asympv ] ) is needed in order to avoid double counting .",
    "due to signature conservation , the 2-to-3 transition has to vanish . for the connected part of the kernel one obtains for a particular ordering of color and momenta indices @xmath22,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the above expression needs to be supplemented by expressions which arise due to all permutations of the indices 1,2,3 . applying the above argument we define ( the formally divergent ) integral over @xmath26 by @xmath27 which puts ( [ eq : threetrans ] ) to zero .",
    "a similar results holds for the disconnected pieces .",
    "the 2-to-4 transition is allowed by signature conservation .",
    "a building block of the complete 2-to-4 kernel , namely the reggeon - particle-2 reggeons vertex , was derived from the effective action and brought into a purely transverse form in @xcite .",
    "the complete unintegrated 2-to-4 vertex can be derived from ( [ eq : effact1 ] ) , but the expression is too lengthy to be reproduced here .",
    "in contrast to ( [ eq : threetrans ] ) , the @xmath26 integral is replaced by @xmath28 and therefore the integral does not vanish by the previous argument , but leads to a logarithm in @xmath13 .",
    "the integrals over the variables @xmath29 , @xmath30 can be performed using the principal value pole prescription , but the obtained result does not reproduce correctly all parts of the 2-to-4 vertex as derived in @xcite . therefore the pole prescription in terms of principal values needs to be generalized in a way that it reproduces all energy discontinuities of the 2-to-4 reggeon vertex .",
    "this is work in progress .",
    "using the principal value pole prescription we rederived the gluon trajectory and reproduced the 2-to-2 kernel in the symmetric color configuration .",
    "the anti - symmetric color configuration was shown to vanish if one takes into account that the effective action is formulated for central rapidities . by the same argument the 2-to-3 transition vanishes . to integrate out the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the 2-to-4 transition kernel",
    ", it seems to be necessary to generalize the principal value pole prescription to reproduce correctly all energy discontinuities .",
