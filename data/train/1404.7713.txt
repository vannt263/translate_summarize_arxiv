    ", the uncertainty principle can be roughly recast as follows : if a function @xmath11 has a spectrogram that is essentially concentrated inside a region @xmath2 , then the area of @xmath15 must be at least 1 ( see for example the recent survey @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , if @xmath16 has norm 1 and @xmath17 , then @xmath18 ( * ? ? ? * theorem 3.3.3 ) . besides the basic restrictions on its measure ,",
    "not much is known about the possible shapes that such a set @xmath15 can assume .    in this article",
    "we choose a different point of view on the uncertainty principle .",
    "we fix a compact domain @xmath2 in time - frequency space and then try to determine those functions whose spectrogram is essentially supported on @xmath1 .",
    "thus we try to maximize the concentration of the spectrogram of a function on a set @xmath15 . to be precise , let @xmath19 be a compact set and @xmath20 a fixed window function .",
    "we consider the following optimization problem : @xmath21 in analogy to landau - pollack - slepian theory of prolate spheroidal functions @xcite , this problem can be studied through spectral analysis .",
    "the relevant operator is known as the _ time - frequency localization operator _ with symbol @xmath15 @xcite and is defined formally as @xmath22 it can be shown that if @xmath15 is compact , then @xmath23 is a compact and positive operator on @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "hence @xmath23 can be diagonalized as @xmath25 where @xmath26 are the non - zero eigenvalues of @xmath23 ordered non - increasingly and @xmath27 is the corresponding orthonormal set of eigenfunctions .",
    "( the functions @xmath28 and the eigenvalues @xmath29 depend on the choice of the window @xmath14 , but we do not make this dependence explicit in the notation . )    the reason why @xmath23 is useful for studying the optimization problem is that @xmath30 consequently , the first eigenfunction @xmath31 of @xmath23 solves : @xmath32 if the set @xmath15 is small , we expect @xmath33 to be small because , as a consequence of the uncertainty principle , no spectrogram fits inside @xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath15 is big we expect to have a number of approximate solutions , since a number of spectrograms may fit inside @xmath15 .",
    "this intuition is made precise by studying the distribution of eigenvalues of @xmath23 .",
    "the min - max lemma for self - adjoint operators asserts that @xmath34 hence , the profile of the eigenvalues of @xmath15 shows how many orthogonal functions have a spectrogram well - concentrated on @xmath15 .",

    "more refined asymptotics are available @xcite ( see also section [ sec_eigenvalues ] ) .",
    "these results parallel the fundamental results for fourier multipliers ( ideal low - pass filters ) by landau , pollak and slepian @xcite .",
    "indeed , the eigenfunctions of @xmath23 are the proper analogue of the prolate spheroidal functions associated to a general domain @xmath1 in phase space",
    ".    see figure [ fig_eigenvals ] for a numerical example for proposition [ prop_eigen_soft ] for a star - shaped domain .      the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalue distribution in implies that , after sufficiently dilating @xmath15 , the @xmath4 concentration @xmath38 is close to 1 for @xmath39 and decays for large @xmath40 .",
    "the purpose of this article is to refine the description of the time - frequency localization of the eigenfunctions @xmath41 .",
    "we will show that the corresponding spectrograms approximately form a partition of unity on @xmath15 .",
    "more precisely , we consider the following function , which we call the _ accumulated spectrogram_.    for a compact set @xmath42 and a window function @xmath6 we let @xmath43 be the smallest integer greater than or equal to @xmath44 and @xmath45 be the set of normalized eigenfunctions of @xmath23 ordered non - increasingly with respect to the corresponding eigenvalues .",
    "the accumulated spectrogram of @xmath15 ( with respect to @xmath14 ) is @xmath46    our goal is to prove that @xmath47 looks approximately like @xmath48 ( the characteristic function of @xmath15 ) .",

    "while bounds the @xmath70-error ( normalized over @xmath1 ) incurred when approximating @xmath47 by @xmath48 , it is even more interesting to obtain pointwise error estimates . applying chebyshev s inequality to  , we obtain that @xmath72 as our final result we will prove the following refined weak-@xmath4 error estimate .",

    "then @xmath74    theorem  [ th_weak_l2 ] says that the size of the set where @xmath75 differs significantly from @xmath76 is of order @xmath77 .",
    "this is the expected order : along the boundary @xmath78 the characteristic function @xmath76 has a jump singularity , whereas the accumulated spectrogram @xmath79 is smooth ( at least uniformly continuous )",

    "this property is independent of the window @xmath14 ( which enters only through some constants in the error estimates ) .",
    "even more is true : the asymptotic result of theorem  [ th_one_point ] is completely independent of @xmath14 .    in mathematics ,",
    "the term `` universality '' is used to describe phenomena where properties of complex systems simplify in an asymptotic regime and then depend only on few parameters .",
    "the primary examples are the central limit theorem in probability or the eigenvalue distribution of random matrices .",
    "( see @xcite for an overview of universality in several contexts . )    in this sense , theorem  [ th_one_point ] expresses a new and intriguing universality property .",
    "whereas the accumulated spectrograms for a fixed domain with different windows may display a vastly different behavior for small scales , they all approach the characteristic function in the scaling limit @xmath83 . see figure  [ fig_funcs ] .",
    "the universality property expressed by theorem 1.3 has also a probabilistic interpretation .",
    "consider the finite dimensional space generated by the short - time fourier transform of the first @xmath84 eigenfunctions of @xmath85 and its associated reproducing kernel .",
    "the accumulated spectrogram is the one - point intensity of the determinantal point process associated with this reproducing kernel ( see @xcite for precise definitions ) .",
    "thus , theorem 1.3 asserts that the asymptotic limit of this one - point intensity is the uniform distribution on @xmath15 , independently of the chosen window g.      it is instructive to discuss a case where all the objects can be computed explicitly .",

    "in signal processing , the time - frequency localization operators @xmath23 are also called _ time - frequency filters_. whereas the classical time - invariant filters multiply the fourier transform of a signal by a given symbol , time - frequency filters localize signals both in time and frequency and are therefore time - varying .",
    "the field of system identification studies the possibility of retrieving a linear operator from its response to a set of test signals . for time - varying systems the identification problem is particularly difficult @xcite .    in the case of a time - frequency filter ,",
    "it is also important to understand to what extent the operator @xmath23 can be understood from the measurement of a few of its eigenmodes ( eigenfunctions ) @xmath320 . in @xcite",
    "the following special case was established ( see @xcite for a discussion on possible applications ) .",
    "[ th_abdo ] let @xmath86 , @xmath87 , be the one - dimensional gaussian and let @xmath321 be compact and simply connected . if one of the eigenfunctions of @xmath23 is a hermite function , then @xmath15 is a disk centered at @xmath322 .",
    "hence , for a gaussian window , @xmath1 is completely determined by the information that ( a ) @xmath2 is a simply connected with given measure @xmath323 and that ( b ) one of the eigenfunctions of @xmath23 is a hermite function .",
    "however , theorem [ th_abdo ] has some drawbacks .",
    "first , it is non - robust : from the information that the eigenmodes of @xmath23 look approximately like hermite functions we can not conclude that @xmath15 is approximately a disk .",
    "second , it only applies to the restricted situation of a one - dimensional gaussian window .",
    "both restrictions stem from the one - variable complex analysis techniques used in @xcite .",
    "while the exact and robust recovery of the fine details of a time - frequency filter may not be possible only from measurements of a few of its eigenmodes , we may recover at least the coarse shape of the set by means of the accumulated spectrogram .",
    "let us consider a time - frequency filter @xmath23 and suppose that we know the measure of @xmath15 and the _ spectrogram _ of the first eigenmodes @xmath50 , @xmath43 .",
    "then we approximate the ( unknown ) domain @xmath1 by the level sets of the accumulated spectrogram @xmath324 .",
    "[ th_recovery ] let @xmath62 and let @xmath19 be a compact set with finite perimeter and @xmath73 .",

    "let us note that @xmath329 indeed , if @xmath330 , then @xmath331 . hence @xmath332 .",

    "the equality in simply means that @xmath336 .",
    "to finish the proof , we apply theorem [ th_weak_l2 ] to bound the measure of @xmath337 : @xmath338    finally we observe that the approximation @xmath339 does not require the phases of the short - time fourier transforms @xmath340 but only their absolute values .",
