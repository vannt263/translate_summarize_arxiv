    "in recent years , diamond as a possible material for particle detectors has been the subject of considerable interest  @xcite .",
    "significant progress in the techniques to produce synthetical diamond films of very high quality has been achieved by means of the chemical vapour deposition method ( cvd ) .",
    "a number of commercial manufactures of cvd diamond films  @xcite and research institutes  @xcite have made systematic studies of the properties of this material feasible .",
    "the main advantage of the material compared to other semiconductor detector materials is its radiation hardness , which has recently been demonstrated to neutron fluences of up to @xmath0@xcite .",
    "the radiation hardness of the material is of strong interest for the detector development at projected experiments where high radiation levels are expected due to the increasing luminosity and energy , as e.g. the experiments at the large hadron collider at cern .",
    "the main problem of using cvd diamond as a detector material are the charge collection properties , since an application as a detector for ionising particles requires that the material response is homogeneous throughout the volume and that a sufficient fraction of the produced charge is collected .",
    "general studies of the cvd diamond growth conditions for detector applications with a large sample are presented in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we present different studies of the charge collection properties of cvd diamond films .",
    "we investigate both the bulk properties of the material and the behaviour of charge produced close to the surface .",
    "one of the aspects which make cvd diamond films an attractive material for the detector development is its very high specific resistivity of @xmath1 .",
    "this allows a very simple construction of a detector as a solid state ionisation chamber ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - detector ] ) . by contacting the material on opposite sides and applying a sufficient potential across the contacts , charges produced in the bulk of the material by an incident charged",
    "particle start to drift towards the electrodes    and induce mirror charges .",
    "the ratio of the amount of charge measured , @xmath2 , to the amount of charge produced , @xmath3 , is the collection efficiency @xmath4.\\ ] ] the efficiency is below 100% , if trap- or recombination - sites in the material hinder the charge carriers to reach the electrodes , as is the case for diamond .",
    "the mean free path length @xmath5 , also called schubweg  @xcite , for each type of charge carriers ( @xmath6 for electrons and holes ) can be expressed as the product of the mobility @xmath7 , the electric field strength @xmath8 and the life - time @xmath9 , as @xmath10 the combined mean free paths of electrons and holes , @xmath11 is the mean distance a hole and an electron can separate .",
    "this distance is referred to as the collection distance  @xcite .",
    "the collection distance and the efficiency @xmath12 are related according to ramo s theorem  @xcite by @xmath13 with @xmath14 being the detector thickness .",
    "the above discussion holds for uniform ionisation within the detector volume and @xmath15 .",
    "if the charge is created in the vicinity of one electrode ( @xmath16 , with @xmath17 the distance of the charge to the electrode ) the van hecht - equation  @xcite relates @xmath12 and @xmath5 as @xmath18 where @xmath19 denotes the schubweg for electrons and holes respectively , depen- + ding on the direction of the electrical field .    throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the quantity @xmath12 because the definition of @xmath12 involves fewer assumptions than the charge collection distance .",
    "however , the values are given in collection distance as well where appropriate .",
    "systematic studies of the dependence of @xmath12 on growth parameters have shown that high values of @xmath12 are reached for films produced with slow growth rates  @xcite . until now charge collection efficiencies of up to 38%  @xcite have been reported .",
    "it is known that the exposure of diamond to ionising radiation and uv - light can substantially increase @xmath12 .",
    "this phenomenon is called priming  @xcite .",
    "the passivation of traps by occupation with free charge carriers is the reason for the observed behaviour .",
    "the same mechanism leads to a deterioriation of the signal as for example seen when irradiating diamond with alpha particles or protons at energies corresponding to stopping ranges of a few micron .",
    "the deterioriation is caused by the build - up of space charge and the resulting compensation of the applied field  @xcite .",
    "another important issue is the homogeneity of @xmath12 .",
    "it is known that the collection distance ( which relates to @xmath12 by eq .",
    "[ eq - cd ] ) varies with the film thickness , as low values are typically observed on the substrate side and high values on the growth side .",
    "this is due to the fact that polycrystalline cvd diamond films consist of several columnar micro - crystallites .",
    "typically the crystallites are very small at the beginning of the growth process and become larger as the film thickness increases  @xcite .",
    "a linear model has been proposed to describe the collection distance as a function of the film thickness  @xcite . for an application as a particle detector ,",
    "it is important that the average @xmath12 is constant over the active detector area .",
    "while highly energetic minimum ionising particles yield a rather homogeneous response ( see section  [ s - mips ] ) , it has been shown that this is not the case for particles depositing their charge in a thin surface layer  @xcite .",
    "thin films for which the stopping range of the ionising particle is of the order of the film thickness seem to exhibit a more homogeneous response  @xcite .",
    "we investigate the charge collection properties of cvd diamonds by four different methods .",
    "the response of cvd diamond to homogeneous ionisation densities has been measured with beta particles from a source .",
    "the ionisation density produced by beta particles above @xmath20 is similar to the ionisation density produced by minimum ionising particles ( mips ) , which are to be detected in the application as a vertex detector in a high energy particle physics experiment . by fitting the pulse height distribution",
    ", we obtained information about the homogeneity of @xmath12 . to investigate the priming effect on the cvd diamond samples ,",
    "@xmath12 has been measured with beta particles while the samples were under continuous exposure of ionising radiation . in a second experiment ,",
    "the diamond has been scanned with a beam of 10 kev photons .",
    "the photons ionise via the photo effect and produce when averaged over many events a similar ionisation density distribution as mips . with this method",
    "the local variations of @xmath12 have been measured with a resolution of about @xmath21 .",
    "the results are compared with the data obtained with mips .    in contrast , the other two methods described in this paper use radiation which produces charge carriers only in a shallow layer below the surface .",
    "hence , these methods are not measurements of the bulk properties as are the first two .",
    "since all the produced charge is deposited in a surface layer of the detector , they are more sensitive to polarisation effects , as will be discussed in section  [ s - conclusion ] .",
    "one method uses alpha particles from an source .",
    "various pulse height spectra have been recorded at different electrical field strengths and polarities in order to extract information about @xmath12 .",
    "the other method uses protons with an energy of 2 mev and allows to do a spatially resolved measurement .",
    "the recorded pulse spectra are mapped onto the diamond surface .",
    "the spatial information has been used to compare the data to sem ( scanning - electron - microscopy ) pictures and to data obtained with the 10 kev photon beam described above .",
    "for the studies presented here , two cvd diamond samples produced by different manufacturers ( sample a from norton  @xcite and sample b from fhg  @xcite ) have been used .",
    "the sample a was initially grown to a thickness of @xmath22 after which @xmath23 were removed from the substrate side  @xcite .",
    "the growth side has been polished to reduce the surface roughness , which has been measured to be smaller than @xmath24 after polishing  @xcite .",
    "the grain - size on the growth side is in the order of @xmath21 .",
    "no information is available about the grain size on the substrate side .",
    "the sample size is @xmath25 .",
    "sample b has been grown to a thickness of @xmath26 and is not polished .",
    "the grains have a typical size of @xmath27 on the growth side . from sem",
    "we estimate a surface roughness of below @xmath28 .",
    "the sample has a circular shape and a diameter of @xmath29 .",
    "pole figure measurements  @xcite showed no preferred orientation for sample a and a slight ( 111)-texture for sample b.    in order to provide electrical contacts , both samples have been metallised on growth and substrate side with layers of ti ( 50  nm ) , pt ( 30  nm ) and au ( 60  nm ) , followed by an annealing step and treatment in oxygen plasma to reduce surface conductivity  @xcite .",
    "the quality of the contacts has been checked by measuring the current - voltage ( i - v ) characteristic in darkness at room temperature .",
    "all i - v - curves are symmetric , i.e.  independent of polarity , indicating , that front and back - contact are of the same type .",
    "the specific resistivities and some of the properties of the samples are listed in table  [ tab - samples ] .",
    ".[tab - samples]properties of the investigated samples .",
    "@xmath30 stands for growth rate , @xmath14 for film thickness and @xmath31 for the specific resistivity .",
    "dcaj stands for _ direct current arc jet process _ and mwp for _ micro wave plasma process_. [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     within the accuracy of the matching of the sem - picture and the @xmath12 map we assigned the highlighted area shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - agathe - sem ] to this hot spot .",
    "the size of the highlighted area includes the estimated error on the matching .",
    "it shows that the hot spot sits most likely on the cloven structure as indicated in the picture .",
    "we also scanned the substrate side of the diamond .",
    "the results of the substrate side gave a similar picture .",
    "again the edges of the metallisation showed significant higher counting rates and hot spots appeared also on the substrate side .",
    "however , the population with hot spots was denser on the substrate side ( spot density of about @xmath32 ) and they were smaller in dimension ( typically @xmath33 to @xmath24 ) than on the growth side .",
    "this can be explained by the fact that the average grain size is smaller on the substrate side than on the growth side  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the existence of hot spots on the substrate side indicates that the surface roughness is not responsible for this phenomenon , since the substrate side was polished .",
    "we tried to correlate @xmath12 maps of the growth side and the substrate side .",
    "if hot spots would appear at the same locations on the growth and on the substrate side it could indicate that continuous crystal columns of high collection efficiency are present at this locations .",
    "however , we could not observe a spatial correlation between the hot spot from the substrate and the growth side .",
    "this indicates that the lattice orientation or the crystal quality of the columnar structured crystallites are not a sufficient condition for a hot spot .",
    "the instability of some hot spots indicate a close link to polarisation phenomena as proposed by @xcite .",
    "the result indicates that the crystallite orientation , quality and size are not sufficient conditions to produce a hot spot .",
    "the results favour the interpretation of a complex polarisation phenomenon at grain boundaries  @xcite .",
    "this view is supported by the spatially resolved measurement of @xmath12 with 10 kev photons , which ionise uniformly in the bulk and suppress polarisation .",
    "no enhancement of @xmath12 was seen with photons at the hot spot locations found with protons .",
    "we have presented four experiments using different types of ionising radiation to investigate the charge collection properties of cvd diamond . in particular , we have used beta - particles of up to @xmath34 , a narrow beam of @xmath35 photons from a synchrotron source , @xmath36 alpha - particles and a @xmath37 proton micro - beam .",
    "the samples show an increase of the charge collection efficiency , @xmath12 , when irradiated with beta - particles . the radiation dose needed to achieve saturation of this",
    "so called priming effect is different by a factor 15 between the two investigated samples .",
    "the relative improvements of @xmath12 ( @xmath38 for sample a and @xmath39 for sample b ) are comparable .    to obtain information about the lateral distribution of @xmath12 , the signal spectrum recorded with beta particles was fitted with a smeared vavilov - distribution which results in an intrinsic broadening of @xmath12 of @xmath40 for sample a ( see section  [ s - mips ] ) .",
    "this value is in good agreement with a direct measurement of the width and the spatial distribution of @xmath12 with a beam of @xmath35 photons , which measures for the same sample @xmath41    in contrast , the response behaviour of the cvd diamond samples to mono - energetic alpha - particle and protons with stopping ranges of a few microns indicates a much higher value for @xmath42 .",
    "the particles produce a very broad pulse distribution with an exponential fall - off towards large pulse - heights .",
    "a strong polarisation build - up decreases the average value of @xmath12 and the counting rate during irradiation .",
    "this confirms observations reported in  @xcite .",
    "the spatially resolved measurement of @xmath12 with a proton micro - beam reveals single spots ( hot spots ) in the material with a high response embedded in passive areas , which is in agreement with observation made in  @xcite .",
    "the shape of the hot spots and the correlation with sem - pictures indicates that hot spots are bound to the crystallite structure .",
    "since hot spots appear on the growth and on the polished substrate side we conclude that hot spots are neither caused by distinct surface topologies , nor require a certain crystallite size .",
    "the most likely explanation seems to be that particular configurations of grain boundaries in the bulk , which are most likely to possess a high trap density  @xcite , influence the polarisation field in the neighbourhood of single crystallites .",
    "the unstable behaviour of some hot spots and the good response on metallisation edges corroborates this assumption . as a result of this proposed complex and non - uniform polarisation , @xmath12 as seen by low energy particles is inhomogeneous .",
    "this is supported by the measurements with alpha - particles .",
    "the pulse distributions obtained with alpha - particles are compatible with the proton micro - beam measurements .",
    "furthermore , the hot spots seen with the proton micro - beam do not show significantly higher values of @xmath12 compared to a @xmath35 photon beam .",
    "this suggests that the existence of hot spots is bound not only to a good crystal quality in this particular spot , but also to distinct features of the polarisation field in this area .",
    "the maps of @xmath12 obtained with a proton micro - beam are highly distorted by the local polarisation fields .",
    "thus this method is not suitable to determine maps of @xmath12 for mips .",
    "the observed increase of @xmath12 under irradiation with mips and the decrease of @xmath12 observed under irradiation with protons and alpha particles is not contradictory . in the former case traps",
    "are filled throughout the bulk thus increasing @xmath12 due to the decrease of active trap levels . however , because of the rather homogeneous distribution of the trapped charge no effective polarisation field is produced . in the latter case the majority of the charge is deposited in a shallow layer . in the electric field",
    "the charge carriers are separated and trapped and thus create a strong polarisation field .",
    "the polarisation is dominating over the increase of @xmath12 from trap passivation .    the applicability of cvd diamond as a particle detector depends on the radiation to be detected . for radiation",
    "which deposits charge inhomogeneously as in the case of alpha - particles , whose stopping range is much less than the film thickness , @xmath12 varies strongly and the stability is very poor . for homogeneous ionisation typically produced by mips or synchrotron - radiation at photon energies with @xmath43 ,",
    "@xmath12 is stable if the detector is in its primed state , and a gaussian - like distribution is observed .",
    "thus , we conclude that cvd diamond has the potential of being used as a stable detector for homogeneous ionisation density distributions .",
    "however the relatively high value of @xmath42 might limit the achievable resolution of a position sensitive device .",
