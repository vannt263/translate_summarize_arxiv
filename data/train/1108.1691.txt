    "a stationary process @xmath0 is said to be statistically time reversible ( hereafter time reversible ) if for every @xmath1 , the series @xmath2 and @xmath3 have the same joint probability distributions @xcite .",
    "roughly , this means that a reversible time series and its time reversed are , statistically speaking , equally probable .",
    "reversible processes include the family of gaussian linear processes ( as well as fourier - transform surrogates and nonlinear static transformations of them ) , and are associated with processes at thermal equilibrium in statistical physics .",
    "conversely , time series irreversibility is indicative of the presence of nonlinearities in the underlying dynamics , including non - gaussian stochastic processes and dissipative chaos , and are associated with systems driven out - of - equilibrium in the realm of thermodynamics @xcite .",
    "time series irreversibility is an important topic in basic and applied science . from a physical perspective , and based on the relation between statistical reversibility and physical dissipation @xcite , recent work uses the concept of time series irreversibility to derive information about the entropy production of the physical mechanism generating the series , even if one ignores any detail of such mechanism @xcite . in a more applied context",
    ", it has been suggested that irreversibility in complex physiological series decreases with aging or pathology , being maximal in young and healthy subjects @xcite , rendering this feature important for noninvasive diagnosis . as complex signals pervade natural and social sciences , the topic of time series reversibility is indeed relevant for scientists aiming to understand and model the dynamics behind complex signals .",
    "the definition of time series reversibility is formal and therefore there is not an _ a priori _ optimal algorithm to quantify it in practice .",
    "recently , several methods to measure time irreversibility have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the majority of them perform a time series symbolization , typically making an empirical partition of the data range @xcite ( note that such a transformation does not alter the reversible character of the output series @xcite ) and subsequently analyze the symbolized series , through statistical comparison of symbol strings occurrence in the forward and backwards series or using compression algorithms @xcite .",
    "the first step requires an extra amount of _ ad hoc _ information ( such as range partitioning or size of the symbol alphabet ) and therefore the output of these methods eventually depend on these extra parameters .",
    "a second issue is that since typical symbolization is local , the presence of multiple scales ( a signature of complex signals ) could be swept away by this coarse - graining : in this sense multi - scale algorithms have been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "motivated by these facts , here we explore the usefulness of the horizontal visibility algorithm in such context .",
    "this is a time series analysis method which was proposed recently @xcite .",
    "it makes use of graph theoretical concepts , and it is based on the mapping of a time series to a graph and the subsequent analysis of the associated graph properties @xcite .",
    "here we propose a _ time directed _ version of the horizontal visibility algorithm , and we show that it is a simple and well defined tool for measuring time series irreversibility .",
    "more precisely , we show that the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite between the _ out _ and _ in _ degree distributions , @xmath4 $ ] , is a simple measure of the irreversibility of real - valued stationary stochastic series .",
    "analytical and numerical results support our claims , and the presentation is as follows : the method is introduced in section ii . in section iii we analyze reversible time series generated from linear stochastic processes , which yield @xmath5=0 $ ] . as a further validation , in section",
    "iv we report the results obtained for irreversible series .",
    "we first analyze a thermodynamic system ( a discrete flashing ratchet ) which shows time irreversibility when driven out of equilibrium . its amount of irreversibility can be increased continuously tuning the value of a parameter of the system , and we find that the method can , not only distinguish , but also quantify the degree of irreversibility .",
    "we also study the effect of applying a stalling force in the opposite direction of the net current of particles in the ratchet . in this case",
    "the benchmark measure fails predicting reversibility whereas a generalized measure based on degree - degree distributions @xmath6 $ ] goes beyond the phenomenon associated to physical currents and still detects irreversibility .",
    "we extend this analysis to chaotic signals , where our method distinguishes between dissipative and conservative chaos , and we analyze chaotic signals polluted with noise .",
    "finally , a discussion is presented in section v.",
    "the family of visibility algorithms is a collection of methods that map series to networks according to specific geometric criteria @xcite .",
    "the general purpose of such methods is to accurately map the information stored in a time series into an alternative mathematical structure , so that the powerful tools of graph theory may eventually be employed to characterize time series from a different viewpoint , bridging the gap between nonlinear time series analysis , dynamical systems , and graph theory @xcite .",
    "we focus here on a specific subclass called horizontal visibility algorithm , firstly proposed in @xcite , and defined as follows : let @xmath7 be a real - valued time series of @xmath1 data .",
    "the algorithm assigns each datum of the series to a node in the _ horizontal visibility graph _ ( hvg ) .",
    "then , two nodes @xmath8 and @xmath9 in the graph are connected if one can draw a _ horizontal _ line in the time series joining @xmath10 and @xmath11 that does not intersect any intermediate data height ( see figure [ imagen ] ) .",
    "hence , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are two connected nodes if the following geometrical criterion is fulfilled within the time series : @xmath12 some results regarding the characterization of stochastic and chaotic series through this method have been put forward recently @xcite , and the first steps for a mathematically sound characterization of horizontal visibility graphs have been established @xcite .",
    "interestingly , a very recent work suggests that the method can be used in practice to characterize not only time series but generic nonlinear discrete dynamical systems , sharing similarities with the theory of symbolic dynamics @xcite .",
    "so far in the literature the family of visibility graphs are undirected , as visibility did not have a predefined temporal arrow .",
    "however , as already suggested in the seminal paper @xcite , such a directionality can be made explicit by making use of directed networks or digraphs @xcite .",
    "we address such directed version , defining a _ directed _ horizontal visibility graph ( dhvg ) as a hvg , where the degree @xmath13 of the node @xmath14 is now splitted in an _ ingoing _ degree @xmath15 , and an _ outgoing _ degree , such that @xmath16 .",
    "the ingoing degree @xmath13 is defined as the number of links of node @xmath14 with other _",
    "past _ nodes associated with data in the series ( that is , nodes with @xmath17 ) .",
    "conversely , the outgoing degree @xmath18 , is defined as the number of links with _ future _ nodes .    .",
    "each datum in the series is mapped to a node in the graph .",
    "arrows , describing allowed directed visibility , link nodes .",
    "the associated directed horizontal visibility graph is plotted below . in this graph , each node has an ingoing degree @xmath19 , which accounts for the number of links with @xmath20 nodes , and an outgoing degree @xmath21 , which in turn accounts for the number of links with @xmath22 nodes .",
    "the asymmetry of the resulting graph can be captured in a first approximation through the invariance of the outgoing ( or ingoing ) degree series under time reversal.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    for a graphical illustration of the method , see figure [ imagen ] .",
    "the degree distribution of a graph describes the probability of an arbitrary node to have degree @xmath23 ( i.e. @xmath23 links ) @xcite .",
    "we define the _ in _ and _ out _ ( or ingoing and outgoing ) degree distributions of a dhvg as the probability distributions of @xmath24 and @xmath19 of the graph which we call @xmath25 and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "the main conjecture of this work is that the information stored in the @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions take into account the amount of time irreversibility of the associated series .",
    "more precisely , we claim that this can be measured , in a first approximation , as the distance ( in a distributional sense ) between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 degree distributions ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "if needed , higher order measures can be used , such as the corresponding distance between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 degree - degree distributions ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "these are defined as the @xmath27 and @xmath28 joint degree distributions of a node and its first neighbors @xcite , describing the probability of an arbitrary node whose neighbor has degree @xmath33 to have degree @xmath23 .",
    "we make use of the kullback - leibler divergence @xcite as the distance between the _ in _ and _ out _ degree distributions .",
    "relative entropy or kullback - leibler divergence ( kld ) is introduced in information theory as a measure of distinguishability between two probability distributions .",
    "given a random variable @xmath34 and two probability distributions @xmath35 and @xmath36 , kld between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is defined as follows :    @xmath39    which vanishes if and only if both probability distributions are equal @xmath40 and it is bigger than zero otherwise . unlike other measures used to estimate time irreversibility @xcite ,",
    "the kld is statistically significant , as it is proved by the chernoff - stein lemma : the probability of incorrectly guessing ( via hypothesis testing ) that a sequence of @xmath41 data is distributed as @xmath37 when the true distribution is @xmath38 tends to @xmath42 when @xmath43 .",
    "the kld is then related to the probability to fail when doing an hypothesis test , or equivalently , it is a measure of distinguishability : the more distinguishable are @xmath37 and @xmath38 with respect to each other , the larger is @xmath44 .    in statistical mechanics , the kld can be used to measure the time irreversibility of data produced by nonequilibrium processes but also to estimate the average entropy production of the physical process that generated the data @xcite .",
    "irreversibility can be assessed by the kld between probability distributions associated to observables in the process and in its time reversal .",
    "these measure gives lower bounds to the entropy production , whose accuracy increases as the observables contain a more detailed description of the system .",
    "the measure that we present in this work has this limitation : it takes the information from the degree , which is a partial description of the process .",
    "consequently , our technique does not give a tight bound to the entropy production .",
    "nevertheless , as we will show in several examples , the information of the outgoing degree distribution @xmath21 is sufficient to distinguish between reversible and irreversible stochastic stationary series which are real - valued but discrete in time @xmath45 .",
    "we compare the outgoing degree distribution in the actual ( forward ) series @xmath46 with the corresponding probability in the time - reversed ( or backward ) time series , which is equal to the probability distribution of the ingoing degree in the actual process @xmath47 .",
    "the kld between these two distributions is @xmath48=\\sum_k p_{\\rm out}(k)\\log\\frac{p_{\\rm out}(k)}{p_{\\rm in}(k)}.\\label{dkl}\\ ] ] this measure vanishes if and only if the outgoing and ingoing degree probability distributions of a time series are identical , @xmath49 , and it is positive otherwise",
    ". we will apply it to several examples as a measure of irreversibility .",
    "notice that previous methods to estimate time series irreversibility generally proceed by first making a ( somewhat _ ad hoc _ ) local symbolization of the series , coarse - graining each of the series data into a symbol ( typically , an integer ) from an ordered set .",
    "then , they subsequently perform a statistical analysis of word occurrences ( where a word of length @xmath41 is simply a concatenation of @xmath41 symbols ) from the forward and backwards symbolized series @xcite .",
    "time series irreversibility is therefore linked to the difference between the word statistics of the forward and backwards symbolized series .",
    "the method presented here can also be considered as a symbolization if we restrict ourselves to the information stored in the series @xmath50 and @xmath51 . however , at odds with other methods , here the symbolization process ( i ) lacks _ ad hoc _ parameters ( such as number of symbols in the set or partition definition ) , and ( ii ) it takes into account _ global _ information : each coarse - graining @xmath52 is performed using information from the whole series , according to the mapping criterion .",
    "hence , this symbolization naturally takes into account multiple scales , which is desirable if we want to tackle complex signals @xcite .",
    "for illustrative purposes , in figure [ random ] we have plotted the _ in _ and _ out _ degree distributions of the visibility graph associated to an uncorrelated random series @xmath53 of size @xmath54 : the distributions can not be distinguished and kld vanishes ( the numerical value of kld is shown in table [ table1 ] ) which is indicative of a reversible series . in what follows",
    "we provide an exact derivation of the associated outgoing and ingoing degree distributions associated to this specific process , showing that they are indeed identical in the limit of infinite size series .",

    "then , both the _ in _ and _ out _ degree distributions of its associated directed horizontal visibility graph are @xmath57    let @xmath34 be an arbitrary datum of the aforementioned series .",

    "the probability @xmath61 of the datum @xmath34 being capable of exactly seeing @xmath23 data may be expressed as @xmath62where @xmath63 is the probability of @xmath34 seeing at least @xmath23 data .",
    "@xmath63 may be recurrently calculated via @xmath64from which , with @xmath65 , the following expression is obtained @xmath66which together with equation ( [ recurrence ] ) concludes the proof .",
    "an analogous derivation holds for the _ in _ case .",

    "we make use of the time series generated by a discrete flashing ratchet model introduced in @xcite .",
    "the ratchet consists of a particle moving in a one dimensional lattice .",

    "both kld using degree distributions and degree - degree distributions vanish . on the other hand , if @xmath76 is increased , the system is driven out of equilibrium , what introduces a net statistical irreversibility which increases with @xmath76 @xcite . the amount of irreversibility estimated with kld increases with @xmath76 for both measures , therefore the results produced by the method are qualitatively correct .",
    "interestingly enough , the tendency holds even for high values of the potential , where the statistics are poor and the kld of sequences of symbols usually fail when estimating irreversibility @xcite .",
    "however the values of the kld that we find are far below the kld per step between the forward and backward trajectories , which is equal to the dissipation as reported in @xcite .",
    "the degree distributions capture the irreversibility of the original series but it is difficult to establish a quantitative relationship between and the kld between trajectories .",
    "on the other hand , the measure based on the degree - degree distribution @xmath6 $ ] takes into account more information of the visibility graph structure than the kld using degree distributions , providing a closer bound to the physical dissipation as it is expected by the chain rule @xcite , @xmath6\\geq d[p_{\\rm out}(k)||p_{\\rm in}(k)]$ ] .",

    "consider for instance the flashing ratchet with a force opposite to the net current on the system @xcite .",
    "the current vanishes for a given value of the force usually termed as _ stalling force_. when the force reaches this value , the system is still out of equilibrium ( @xmath78 ) and it is therefore time irreversible , but no current of particles is observed if we describe the dynamics of the ratchet with partial information given by the position @xmath34 .",

    "we have applied our method to several chaotic series and found that it is able to distinguish between dissipative and conservative chaotic systems .",
    "dissipative chaotic systems are those that do not preserve the volume of the phase space , and they produce irreversible time series .",

    "if our method is robust , we add an amount of white noise ( measurement noise ) to a signal extracted from a fully chaotic logistic map ( @xmath173 ) . in figure [ robust ] we plot @xmath5 $ ] of its associated visibility graph as a function of the noise amplitude ( the value corresponding to a pure random signal is also plotted for comparison ) .",
    "the kld of the signal polluted with noise is significantly greater than zero , as it exceeds the one associated to the noise in four orders of magnitude , even when the noise reaches the @xmath174 of the signal amplitude .",
    "therefore our method correctly predicts that the signal is irreversible even when adding noise .",
    "in this paper we have introduced a new method to measure time irreversibility of real valued stationary stochastic time series .",
    "the algorithm proceeds by mapping the series into an alternative representation , the directed horizontal visibility graph .",
    "we have shown that the kullback - leibler divergence ( kld ) between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 degree distributions calculated on this graph is a measure of the irreversibility of the series .",
    "we have shown that the difference between the @xmath27 and @xmath28 distributions at @xmath175 measures the asymmetry in the pdf of the slope of the series .",
    "the degree , however , contains information of long - range correlations and structures in the series .",
    "in particular , the degree - degree distribution can detect the irreversibility in a series with a symmetric slope , as we have shown for the flashing ratchet at stall force .",
    "our technique discriminates between conservative and dissipative chaotic maps .",
    "the method has been validated by studying both reversible ( uncorrelated and linearly correlated stochastic processes as well as conservative chaotic maps ) and irreversible ( out - of - equilibrium physical processes and dissipative chaotic maps ) series .",
    "we have also shown that the method is robust against noise , in the sense that irreversible signals are well characterized even when these signals are polluted with a significant amount of ( reversible ) noise .",
    "it is also worth emphasizing that it lacks a symbolization process , and hence it can be applied directly to any kind of real - valued time series .",
    "this makes our technique of potential interest for several communities .",
    "this includes for instance biological sciences , where there is not such a simple tool to discriminate between time series generated by active ( irreversible ) and passive ( reversible ) processes .",

    "<S> we find that the method correctly distinguishes between reversible and irreversible stationary time series , including analytical and numerical studies of its performance for : ( i ) reversible stochastic processes ( uncorrelated and gaussian linearly correlated ) , ( ii ) irreversible stochastic processes ( a discrete flashing ratchet in an asymmetric potential ) , ( iii ) reversible ( conservative ) and irreversible ( dissipative ) chaotic maps , and ( iv ) dissipative chaotic maps in the presence of noise . </S>",
    "<S> two alternative graph functionals , the degree and the degree - degree distributions , can be used as the kullback - leibler divergence argument . </S>",
    "<S> the former is simpler and more intuitive and can be used as a benchmark , but in the case of an irreversible process with null net current , the degree - degree distribution has to be considered to identifiy the irreversible nature of the series . </S>"
