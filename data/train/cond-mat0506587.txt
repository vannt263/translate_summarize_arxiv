    "solution growth emulates a way in which nature often produces single crystals of minerals , i.e.  out of a liquid with a composition that is different from the product  @xcite . in our laboratory , as well as in others ,",
    "many of the materials that are produced for investigations of their physical properties , are grown as single crystals by solution growth . often , when it comes to producing single crystals of a desired phase , insufficient phase - diagram data is available , and we must estimate which composition and temperature ranges may produce the desired phase as well as what crucible to use .",
    "then , based on the products of such experiments , it is decided if and how to alter the the initial composition , temperature range and crucible material .",
    "this process can , at times , require multiple iterations that consume both time and resources .",
    "recently , we have expanded the use of differential thermal analysis ( dta ) as part of this procedure .",
    "we have found that the use of dta can greatly facilitate the optimization of the growth , and can play a role in selecting the right crucible material . in this paper ,",
    "which is focussed on solution growth , the comparison of realistic simulations with experimental differential thermal analysis ( dta ) curves is used to obtain growth parameters without detailed knowledge of phase diagrams , whereas prior use of dta for crystal growth mainly involved detailed and lengthy phase - diagram studies ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    in the following , after describing the experimental techniques ,",
    "we will present simulations of dta signals for a hypothetical binary system .",
    "then we will discuss the dta - assisted growth of three compounds that may serve as examples : tbal , pr@xmath0ni@xmath1si@xmath2 , and ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 .",
    "of these phases , mm - sized single crystals have not been produced before .",
    "the descriptions of solution growth in this paper are by no means complete .",
    "rather , with its focus is on the use of dta for determining solution - growth parameters , it should be considered an extension to earlier papers , by fisk and remeika  @xcite , canfield and fisk  @xcite and canfield and fisher  @xcite .",
    "differential thermal analysis ( dta ) was performed in a perkinelmer pyris dta 7 differential thermal analyzer . as a process gas",
    ", we used zr - gettered ultra - high - purity ar .",
    "for crucibles we used al@xmath1o@xmath5 ( manufactured by perkinelmer ) , mgo ( custom - made by ozark technical ceramics , inc . ) , and ta ( home - made from small - diameter ta tubes ) .",
    "in order to protect the pt cups and the thermocouple of our instrument from possible ta diffusion , the ta crucibles were placed inside standard ceramic crucibles .",
    "the samples , with mass @xmath640 - 80 mg , were made by arc melting appropriate amounts of starting materials with typical ( elemental ) purities of 99.9 - 99.99% .",
    "an experiment consisted of two or three cycles at heating and cooling rates of typically 10 - 40@xmath7c / min .",
    "the data from the first heating cycle was different from data from subsequent heating cycles .",
    "this may have occurred because the sample shape did not conform to the crucible so that it was not in intimate contact with the crucible walls until it had melted , or because a reaction with the crucible changed the composition of the sample . in a dta curve , besides the events described in sec .  3",
    ", there is also a baseline , not associated with the properties of the sample ( see e.g. ref .",
    "this baseline is also influenced by the rate at which the dta - unit ramped .    for the growth experiments we used the following procedure  @xcite .",
    "appropriate amounts of starting materials with typical ( elemental ) purities of 99.9 - 99.99% were selected , pre - alloyed by arc melting , if needed , and put into a crucible .",
    "the crucible material was the same as for the dta experiment , al@xmath1o@xmath5 ( coors ) , mgo ( ozark tech . ) , or ta ( homemade ) . for separating the grown crystals from the remaining liquid",
    ", a sieve was used . for the ceramic crucibles ,",
    "an inverted crucible catches the liquid , while a plug of quartz wool in the catch crucible acted as a sieve .",
    "the ta crucibles were ` 3-cap crucibles '  @xcite , with a built - in sieve .",
    "the crucibles were placed in a flat - bottom quartz ampoule with some quartz wool above and below the crucibles , to prevent possible cracking caused by differential thermal expansion between the quartz and the crucible and to provide cushioning during the decanting process .",
    "the quartz ampoule was evacuated and filled with a partial pressure of ar , so that the pressure in the ampoule was nearly atmospheric at the highest temperature , and was then sealed .",
    "the ampoule was then placed in a box furnace , and subject to a heat treatment determined from dta experiments ( see sec .",
    "after the final temperature had been reached , the ampoule was taken out of the furnace , inverted into the cup of a centrifuge and quickly spun to decant the liquid from the crystals .    for initial characterization , we measured powder x - ray diffraction patterns on one or several finely ground crystals from the growth yield with a rigaku miniflex+ diffractometer employing cu - k@xmath8 radiation .",
    "the patterns were analyzed with rietica  @xcite , using a le bail - type  @xcite of refinement .",
    "for the evaluation of measured dta curves , we compared them to simulated , ideal , dta curves . for the simulations",
    ", we considered a hypothetical binary system , the @xmath8-@xmath9 system ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "this system is composed of @xmath8 and @xmath9 that melt congruently at 700@xmath7c and 1000@xmath7c or 1400@xmath7c , respectively , peritectic compounds @xmath10 and @xmath11 , at @xmath12 and @xmath13 , respectively , and a eutectic alloy of composition @xmath14 with a eutectic temperature of 600@xmath7c . at its decomposition temperature , 800@xmath7c , peritectic",
    "@xmath10 decomposes into a liquid with composition @xmath15 and solid @xmath11 , which in turn decomposes , at 900@xmath7c , into a liquid with composition @xmath16 and solid @xmath9 . for the liquidus lines we chose second - order polynomials with the concentration of @xmath9 as a variable",
    "this functional dependence can be considered realistic  @xcite , and is easily evaluated .     and @xmath9 and two peritectics , @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the dotted line is for @xmath9 melting at 1400@xmath7c .",
    "the dashed vertical lines indicate compositions for which dta curves were calculated.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    a full discussion , see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite , of dta is beyond the scope of this paper and we shall limit our consideration to a rather simple model .",
    "we will consider the dta as a black box , that produces a signal proportional to the temperature derivative of the enthalpy of the sample .",
    "we assume that the enthalpies of formation for the phases @xmath8 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath9 are equal , and that the specific heats for the solid phases and the liquid ( regardless of composition ) , are constant and equal .",
    "then the simulated dta signal is proportional to the temperature derivative of the fraction of solid to liquid , determined by the well - known lever law ( see e.g.ref .",
    "our dta measurements were usually carried out at heating and cooling rates of 10 to 40@xmath7c / min , which does not usually result in an equilibrium distribution of phases .",
    "therefore , a cooling curve was calculated assuming that once a phase has solidified it does not dissolve back , or react with other solid phases",
    ". then the composition of the liquid follows the liquidus line and the final solid contains a nonequilibrium distribution of phases .",
    "the calculated heating curve represents the heating curve of this nonequilibrium distribution of phases under the assumption that the kinetics are such that also during heating the liquidus line is followed .",
    "although the assumptions are not fully realistic , the patterns recognizable in experimentally observed curves are reproduced well by our model .    during a dta measurement ( even in the absence of undercooling ) , there is a difference between the events observed in the heating and cooling curves .",
    "the melting and solidification events have the same onset temperature , but show a width ( dependent on the heating or cooling rate ) . to include this effect in our simulations as an instrument response function",
    ", we assumed this temperature lag is temperature independent and can be described by the ` standard @xmath17 distribution ' , that is often used to describe waiting times  @xcite .        in fig .",
    "2a the calculated dta curves for an alloy of composition @xmath18 are presented ( see dashed vertical line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "events at both the eutectic ( 600@xmath7c ) and liquidus ( 780@xmath7c ) temperatures are clearly observed .",
    "the eutectic is a much more sharply defined event than the liquidus , because the observed thermal event is proportional to the temperature derivative of the fraction of solid - to - liquid . in fig .  2b ,",
    "the calculated dta curves for an alloy of composition @xmath19 are shown ( see dashed vertical line in fig .  1 ) .",
    "the eutectic ( 600@xmath7c ) , and the peritectic decomposition of @xmath10 ( 800@xmath7c ) are clearly observed in the calculations , whereas the liquidus ( 840@xmath7c ) is less obvious . in fig .",
    "2c , the calculated dta curves for an alloy of composition @xmath13 are shown for the case that @xmath9 melts at 1000@xmath7c ( see dashed vertical line in fig .  1 , crossing the lower - lying liquidus line ) .",
    "the eutectic ( 600@xmath7c ) , the peritectic temperature of @xmath10 ( 800@xmath7c ) , the peritectic temperature of @xmath11 ( 900@xmath7c ) and the liquidus ( 956@xmath7c ) are visible . note that in the simulations for figs .",
    "2c the peritectic temperatures for the @xmath10-phase and the eutectic are visible because of the non - equilibrium nature of the model .",
    "such dta curves can be used , especially in the case that the underlying phase diagram is unknown , to determine the temperature range over which crystals can be grown .",
    "for example , the dta curves for a sample of composition @xmath18 show that the primary solidification for that composition can be grown by slowly cooling between 800@xmath7c and 600@xmath7c .",
    "in addition , to separate the crystals from the liquid , the sample should be decanted above 600@xmath7c . after the growth ,",
    "the crystals will be identified as @xmath10 , e.g.  by x - ray diffraction .",
    "crystals of the @xmath11-phase form for @xmath19 and can be grown by slowly cooling between the liquidus , 850@xmath7c , and 800@xmath7c , and separated by decanting above 800@xmath7c . however , choosing the composition @xmath19 is quite demanding : the maximum useful temperature range for growth is only about 30 - 50@xmath7c .",
    "moreover , the weight fraction of crystals to liquid will be low for this composition .",
    "finally , crystals of the @xmath9-phase form for @xmath13 and can be grown ( for the lower - lying liquidus line in fig .",
    "1 ) by cooling slowly between 970@xmath7c , and separated by decanting above 900@xmath7c .     of the phase diagram in fig .  1",
    ", for ( * a * ) @xmath9 melting at 1000@xmath7c and ( * b * ) at 1400@xmath7c . the dotted line in ( * b * ) represents a cooling curve with undercooling by 50@xmath7c taken into account.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the simulations indicate that the event associated with the liquidus can be quite weak ( see figs .",
    "2a and b ) . as we mentioned above",
    ", the strength of the thermal signature for a liquidus is highly dependent on the slope of the liquidus curve , and can be very hard to detect experimentally . consider an identical phase diagram , except that @xmath9 melts at 1400@xmath7c ( dotted in fig .  1 ) . as a result",
    "the liquidus curve above 900@xmath7c is considerably steeper . in fig .  3 , modelled dta cooling curves for @xmath20 alloys from both hypothetical systems",
    "are presented . as can be seen , the dta signature for the system with a lower - melting @xmath9 and a lower slope is much easier to detect , i.e.  removing more solid from the liquid per @xmath7c yields a stronger dta signal .    under the assumption that there is no time lag due to the dissolution of the last solid phase",
    ", the calculated heating curves can be considered realistic representations of actual measurements .",
    "however , experimental cooling curves may be shifted to lower temperatures due to undercooling .",
    "in many systems , the nucleation of the crystalline phase from the liquid can be slow .",
    "since the dta measurements were made at reasonably high cooling rates this may lead to significant undercooling .",
    "( note that in an actual growth experiment , typically at much slower cooling rates , there is probably less undercooling . ) in an undercooled melt , when nucleation does occur , there is a rapid growth of the solid phase . in a simulation for the composition",
    "@xmath21 with @xmath9 melting at 1400@xmath7c , allowing undercooling by 50@xmath7c , the solidification is very clearly visible in the dta curve ( fig .",
    "3b , dotted line ) .",
    "thus whereas we may not detect the true liquidus temperature we may be able to determine both an upper bound given by the maximum temperature to which the sample was heated , and a lower bound given by the solidification event for the liquidus . we can give the upper bound , because when not all crystals have been dissolved ( i.e.  the liquidus temperature has not been reached ) these serve as perfect nucleation centers , preventing undercooling . note that we have frequently observed that peritectic temperatures and occasionally the eutectic temperature are also undercooled .",
    "the growth of tbal provides an example of the importance of identifying the right crucible material , and the role dta measurements can play in this selection .",
    "furthermore , it also provides an example of the efficient determination of a very narrow temperature range , by dta , over which crystals can be grown .",
    "the crystal structure and magnetic properties , that involve anisotropic exchange interactions , of polycrystalline tbal were published some time ago  @xcite . for an estimate of a composition for the initial melt for solution growth ,",
    "we considered the binary phase diagram of the tb - al system . to our knowledge , this has only been predicted  @xcite , from the systematics of different rare - earth - al binary systems , but not verified experimentally in detail .",
    "especially the tb - rich side ( above @xmath6  56% tb ) is uncertain .",
    "this predicted phase diagram includes 2 eutectics , at  3.5% ( 642@xmath7c ) and at  77% tb ( 903@xmath7c ) , and 5 compounds : tbal@xmath5 , tbal@xmath1 , tbal , tb@xmath5al@xmath1 , and tb@xmath1al .",
    "of these , tbal@xmath1 melts congruently , whereas tbal@xmath5 and tbal form peritectically .",
    "even though tb@xmath5al@xmath1 and tb@xmath1al are indicated to form peritectically as well , congruent melting can not be excluded due to a lack of experimental data  @xcite . since the phase diagram around this composition was indicated to be uncertain , a dta experiment , rather than a slow and expensive growth served as an inexpensive and quick check , using only small amounts of starting materials .",
    "the primary - solidification line for tbal reportedly lies between 57% and 67% tb and 1079 - 986@xmath7c .",
    "therefore , for the experiments described below , we chose to use an alloy with composition tb@xmath22al@xmath23 .    in our experience , an alloy with more than 10 - 15% rare earth can not be reliably held in an al@xmath1o@xmath5 crucible , because of thermite - type reactions .",
    "furthermore , we considered it possible that the tb@xmath22al@xmath23 alloy , being also rich in al , would attack ta , the other crucible material we regularly used in the past  @xcite .",
    "mgo , on the other hand , could be stable enough to use . to test the crucibles , we performed dta experiments in the three available crucible materials : al@xmath1o@xmath5 , ta , and mgo . in order to prevent direct contact of unreacted elements with the crucibles , we alloyed samples of approximately 40 mg by arc - melting prior to the dta experiments .",
    "dta heating and cooling cycles were performed three times between @xmath6  1240 and @xmath6  600@xmath7c , at heating rates of 40@xmath7c / min and cooling rates of 10@xmath7c / min .",
    "the curves obtained from the first two cycles , between 800  @xmath7c and the highest temperature reached , are shown in fig .",
    "al@xmath23 in ( a ) al@xmath1o@xmath5,(b ) ta , and ( c ) mgo , measured upon heating with a 40@xmath7c / min rate and cooling with a 10@xmath7c / min rate.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    upon heating , in both the first and the second heating cycle , an endothermic event occurred near 970@xmath7c in all three cases .",
    "besides a shift of the baseline , probably because the contact between the sample and the thermocouple changed after melting , the mgo and ta - crucible curves show no significant difference between the first and second heating curves , and no clear events at higher temperatures .",
    "the two al@xmath1o@xmath5-crucible heating curves , however , are very different : a clear exothermic bump between  1070@xmath7c and  1120@xmath7c is visible in the first heating curve , but not in the second one . furthermore , the endothermic event near 970@xmath7c is less pronounced in the second heating curve , and followed by a pronounced second endothermic event that peaks near 1100@xmath7c .    upon cooling ,",
    "( note that the non - linear but smooth behavior at elevated temperatures in the cooling curves are due to stabilization of the furnace - ramp rate , rather than due to thermal events ) the mgo and ta - crucible curves show no significant difference between the first and the second cooling cycle .",
    "in the al@xmath1o@xmath5-crucible curves , there are several differences between the first and second cooling curves .",
    "particularly , near 1210@xmath7c , a weak exothermic event may be observed in the first cooling curve , but not in the second cooling curve . in both first and second cooling cycles , pronounced exothermic peaks were observed near 1060@xmath7c and 960@xmath7c .",
    "note that the peak near 1060@xmath7c is _ only _ observed in the al@xmath1o@xmath5-crucible curves .",
    "these results are consistent with a thermite - type reaction of the alloy tb@xmath22al@xmath23 with the al@xmath1o@xmath5 crucible , reducing the amount of tb in the metallic liquid , and increasing the amount of al .",
    "the exothermic bump in the first heating cycle , between 1080 and 1120@xmath7c ( fig .",
    "4a ) then is associated with this reaction .",
    "the event that occurred upon cooling at  1060@xmath7c , is likely due to the peritectic temperature of tbal , predicted to be at 1079@xmath7c  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the highest - temperature event in the first cooling cycle was no longer present in the second cooling cycle , maybe due to the sample becoming so rich in al that it could no longer fully melt ( the nearest compound richer in al , al@xmath1 tb reportedly melts at 1514@xmath7c ) .",
    "since both ta and mgo showed no evidence of a reaction , both are good candidates as a crucible material .",
    "( although we worried that the tb@xmath22al@xmath23 alloy would attack ta , there is no clear indication of such an attack from the dta results . ) for the growth experiment , we chose mgo as the crucible material .",
    "al@xmath23 measured upon heating with a 10@xmath7c / min rate and cooling with a 10@xmath7c / min rate.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the heat treatment for the growth experiment is determined from the details of the dta curves . in fig .  5 ,",
    "the relevant parts of a third heating and cooling curve ( measured at 10@xmath7c / min for both heating and cooling ) are shown for an mgo - crucible experiment . upon heating , a sharp endothermic peak",
    "is observed with an onset temperature of about 965@xmath7c .",
    "this is followed by a weak step near 1015 - 1035@xmath7c . upon cooling ,",
    "two events are observed .",
    "there is a weak exothermic bump with an onset temperature of about 1010@xmath7c , followed by a strong exothermic peak with an onset temperature of about 960@xmath7c .",
    "note the resemblance between these experimental results and the simulation in fig .  2a , and also note that there is some undercooling of the liquidus , @xmath65 - 30@xmath7c , that makes the liquidus much more visible upon cooling , as in the simulation in fig .",
    "the measurements suggest that crystals of the primarily solidifying compound for the composition tb@xmath22al@xmath23 can be grown by cooling slowly between @xmath61020@xmath7c and @xmath6965@xmath7c , followed by a decant above @xmath6965@xmath7c .",
    "taking into account the possibility of undercooling , this heat treatment is very demanding ( limited temperature range for growth ) , and may be influenced by differences in thermometry between the growth furnace and the dta .    for the growth experiment , an arc - melted button ( @xmath63  g )",
    "was first heated to 1200@xmath7c , kept at this temperature for 2  h for homogenization , then it was cooled in @xmath61 h to 1020@xmath7c , near the observed liquidus in the heating curve of the dta experiment .",
    "finally , it was cooled in 10  h to 975@xmath7c , which is near the temperature of the onset of the endothermic event in the heating curve of the dta experiment . at this temperature ,",

    "however , we have often observed that binary phase diagrams with rare - earth components need revision ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , and the tb - al binary phase diagram was already known to be uncertain  @xcite .",

    "the growth of ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 provides an example of how dta can help make finding the right composition for solution growth very efficient . the ternary intermetallic compound",
    "ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 has been known at least since 1971  @xcite , but has only been synthesized in polycrystalline form .",
    "recently  @xcite , it was reported that ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 has a narrow pseudogap in the spin excitation spectrum .",
    "this prompted us to try to grow single crystals .",
    "the published partial triangulated ternary isotherm for the y - mn - al system  @xcite at 600@xmath7c suggests that a growth may be attempted from an al - rich liquid .",
    "therefore , we tried to grow it using a composition approximately halfway between al and ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 : y@xmath27mn@xmath28al@xmath29 . we chose an al@xmath1o@xmath5 crucible , since in our experience such an alloy will likely not attack it , and we started with pieces of the elements . the sample was cooled in 15 h between @xmath61200@xmath7c and 950@xmath7c , then decanted .",
    "the mm - sized prismatic crystals in the growth crucible were identified as ymn@xmath1al@xmath26 , which was not reported in the ternary isotherm , but does appear in literature  @xcite .    as a next step",
    ", we alloyed by arc - melting a total of about 1 g of the starting elements in the ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 ratio .",
    "although we had some losses due to evaporation of mn , about 2% , after arc melting , an x - ray powder diffraction experiment indicated the sample to be mainly ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 .",
    "then we performed dta , in an al@xmath1o@xmath5 crucible , on a @xmath620 mg piece .",
    "up to 1350@xmath7c there was only one noticeable thermal event in both the heating and cooling curves , at temperatures between 1220 - 1240@xmath7c .",
    "this , combined with the diffraction , is an indication that ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 is congruently melting at 1220 - 1240@xmath7c .",
    "a congruently melting material is part of its own primary solidification surface .",
    "therefore , we decided to try a composition nearby ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 .",
    "the melting temperature of the desired phase is higher than the reported liquidus temperature for an alloy of composition mn@xmath3al@xmath4 , @xmath61100@xmath7c  @xcite , therefore it seemed possible to grow ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 out of a composition close to the binary mn - al - line .",
    "mn@xmath30al@xmath31 measured upon heating and cooling with a 20@xmath7c / min rate.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    we decided to try an alloy of composition y@xmath3mn@xmath30al@xmath31 using al@xmath1o@xmath5 crucibles .",
    "we alloyed a few grams by arc - melting , and again had losses ( about 3% ) due to mn evaporation .",
    "in order to make a small sample representative for the whole , the arc - melted button was coarsely ground and the powder thoroughly mixed .",
    "about 20 mg of the powder was used for a dta experiment .",
    "the results for heating and cooling at 20@xmath7c / min , between 1000 and 1250@xmath7c , are shown in fig .",
    "8 . in both the heating and the cooling curve , two very pronounced events are visible . in the heating curve ,",
    "peaks are seen near 1110@xmath7c and 1200@xmath7c , while in the cooling curve events occur at onset temperatures of @xmath61180@xmath7c and @xmath61100@xmath7c .",
    "a weak event is observed at lower temperatures of 1030 - 1050@xmath7c in both the heating and cooling curve .",
    "for the determination of growth parameters only the two highest - temperature events are important , therefore we did not measure down to still lower temperatures .",
    "these experimental curves can be compared to the simulated curves in fig .  2c .",
    "the dta experiment suggests that crystals can be grown and separated from the remaining melt by cooling an alloy of composition y@xmath3mn@xmath30al@xmath31 slowly below @xmath61200@xmath7c ( above the highest - temperature peak in the heating curve ) and decanting above @xmath61130@xmath7c ( above the second - highest - temperature peak in the heating curve ) . for a growth experiment",
    ", we started with appropriate amounts of pieces of the elements .",
    "the sample was first heated to 1250@xmath7c for equilibration , and then cooled in 1 h to 1200@xmath7c , below which is was cooled to 1160@xmath7c in 60 h. at this temperature the sample was decanted .",
    "well - separated prismatic crystals were found in the growth crucible .",
    "a photograph of two of those crystals is presented in fig .",
    "powder - x - ray diffraction identified the crystals as ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 , with space group _ i4mmm _ , and lattice parameters a=8.86(1 )  , c=5.12(1 )  , in agreement with the reported crystal structure  @xcite .",
    "the examples presented here address how dta can help in determining growth parameters for solution growth , without detailed knowledge of phase diagrams .",
    "as shown with the example of tbal , dta can sometimes help in identifying the right crucible material , and , moreover , it can help pinpointing a very narrow temperature range over which to grow crystals .",
    "the example of the growth of pr@xmath0ni@xmath1si@xmath2 shows that the combination of dta and growth experiments can help in determining the primarily solidifying compound out of a given metallic liquid , while limiting the growth to that of the primary .",
    "finally , the example of ymn@xmath3al@xmath4 shows how dta can help in the quick determination of the primary phase field for a compound .",
    "extensions of the method can be sought in including other crucible materials for dta , e.g.  bn . or , in order to reduce problems with elements that have high vapor pressures , in sealing the ta - dta crucibles .",
    "however , problems still exist with elements that have a high vapor pressure and can not be held in ta .",
    "as was already discussed by fisk and remeika  @xcite , one of the great advantages of solution growth is the economy of the method . by including dta in the procedure to optimize growth",
    ", it can be economized even further , especially in terms of material costs . furthermore , although dta generally shows that `` something occurs at a certain temperature '' @xcite , the combination of a dta experiment with a growth experiment , if successful , can lead to definite conclusions regarding the primarily solidifying compound out of a metallic liquid of certain composition .",
    "for this it is not necessary to establish a full phase diagram , a dta experiment on a sample of the composition of interest is sufficient .",
