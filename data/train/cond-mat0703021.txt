    "the observation of circular dichroism with electron probes has been considered impossible except with spin polarized electron probes . in 2003",
    "it was suggested that this was not the case  @xcite .",
    "the magnetic transitions that give rise to x - ray magnetic circular dichroism ( xmcd ) contribute to the imaginary part of the mixed dynamic form factor ( mdff )  @xcite for inelastic electron scattering .",
    "since this quantity can be measured in the transmission electron microscope ( tem ) under particular scattering conditions , we predicted that detection of xmcd should be feasible in the tem .",
    "we called the predicted effect energy - loss magnetic chiral dichroism ( emcd ) .    in the first conclusive experimental demonstration of emcd on fe  @xcite it was discovered that the effect is smaller than xmcd . in that experiment",
    "the dichroic signal was close to the noise threshold in the then chosen geometry and the area of investigation was approximately 100  nm in radius .    here",
    "we present a new experimental setup that enhances the count rate by an order of magnitude and reduces the probed area by another factor of five , thus opening the way to applications of emcd on the nanometric scale .",
    "the mdff @xmath3 is the essential quantity describing emcd .",
    "it has been used in the description of interference of inelastically scattered electrons ( _ e .",
    "the semi - relativistic double differential scattering cross section for inelastic electron scattering ( ddscs ) in the plane wave born approximation is  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the bohr radius , @xmath6 @xmath7 is the wave number of the incident ( outgoing ) probe electron , @xmath8 is the wave vector transfer in the interaction and @xmath9 the energy loss .",
    "@xmath10 is the dynamic form factor ( dff ) .",
    "interference between inelastically scattered electrons in the diffraction pattern will occur when the probe electron consists of two or more mutually coherent plane waves  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , this can be realized by a biprism  @xcite or by any other beam splitter .",
    "it was shown experimentally that the crystal itself can be used as a beam splitter for inelastic electron scattering  @xcite . in the crystal the probe electron",
    "is a superposition of bloch waves which , in turn , are coherent superpositions of plane waves defined by the allowed bragg reflections .    for the sake of clarity ,",
    "we consider the simplest case here , namely the superposition of two plane waves with complex amplitudes @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "technically , this situation is approximated in electron diffraction by the two - beam case , the most important plane waves being the incident one and a single bragg scattered wave .",

    ".  [ ddscsinter ] consists of two direct terms , each resembling the angular scattering distributions centered at the incident and the bragg scattered plane wave directions , and an interference term .",
    "[ ddscsinter ] is formally equivalent to the expression for intensity in the double slit experiment .",
    "it should be noted that the diagonal element of the mdff is the dff , @xmath27 .",

    "@xmath29 is such a basis function , and the measurement collapses the probe electron into @xmath30   does not exclude the possibility of interference between outgoing beams with different wave vectors ; any outgoing beam that is bragg scattered to @xmath30 before leaving the crystal can produce interference detectable by the setup described here . ] ) .    with the matrix elements @xmath31 of the transition matrix @xmath32 the mdff , eq .",
    "[ mdff ] can be written as @xmath33    for isotropic systems the transition matrix degenerates to a quantity proportional to the unity matrix  @xcite .",
    "this case was discussed in the context of ionisation fine structure and dynamical diffraction  @xcite .",
    "anisotropy can be induced by a lattice of lower than cubic symmetry , or by magnetic fields .",
    "these can be internal or external , then speaking of natural or magnetic dichroism  @xcite .",
    "it is well known that with photon scattering linear as well as circular dichroism can be measured .",
    "this technique is largely applied with external magnetic fields .",
    "linear magnetic dichroism shows up as an uniaxial anisotropy and can be measured with angle resolved inelastic electron scattering , tuning @xmath34 parallel or perpendicular to the anisotropy axis .",
    "this is equivalent @xcite to the tuning of linear polarization of the photon in xanes experiments .",
    "it has been thought that circular magnetic dichroism can not be detected with electrons except with spin polarized ones . but",
    "let us recall that in xanes the photon does not couple directly to the spin of electrons but to the angular momentum of the excited atom , and the effect becomes visible by the spin - orbit coupling  @xcite .",
    "so there is no reason that spin polarized electrons are needed for detection of circular dichroism in electron energy loss spectrometry ( eels ) .",
    "rather , in the inelastic electron interaction that is equivalent to an xmcd experiment , the virtual photon that is exchanged must be circularly polarized .",
    "the mdff , eq .  [ sdip ] can be written in a different form when we specify the magnetic field direction as the positive @xmath35 axis   and write @xmath36 .",
    "a little algebra shows that @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the unit vector in direction of the @xmath35 axis , and we have used the transition matrix elements in terms of the spherical components @xmath39 of the 3-space operator @xmath40 and similar for all other combinations .",
    "they relate to the cartesian components by the transformation rules for vector spherical harmonics @xcite .",
    "all matrix elements and vector components are real in eq .",
    "[ sfinal ] . in this form",
    "we have separated the mdff into a real component proportional to the scalar product of the wave vector transfers @xmath41 and an imaginary part proportional to their vector product .",
    "this structure is equivalent to that of the polarization tensor used in xmcd , which decomposes into a scalar part ( uneffective in dichroic experiments ) , a second - rank irreducible part detectable by linear dichroism and a pseudovector part sensitive to magnetic moments @xcite and reference therein .",
    "this form of the mdff allows a description of the scattering geometry for emcd detection in the tem . in passing we",
    "note that the imaginary part vanishes if the magnetic transitions ( @xmath42 ) are degenerate .",
    "only when the presence of a magnetic field in @xmath35 direction lifts the @xmath43-degeneracy will we see an effect . for",
    "a transition with fixed energy loss @xmath9 the operators @xmath44 and @xmath45 will then contribute with different oscillator strengths , and the mdff eq .",
    "[ sfinal ] will acquire an imaginary part .",
    "its sign depends on which transitions are allowed by the selection rules .",
    "the imaginary part can be interpreted as the difference in probability to change the magnetic quantum number by @xmath46 .",
    "it thus describes the difference in response of the system to left- respectively right - handed circularly polarized electromagnetic fields  .",
    "the scattering vector @xmath47 in the diffraction plane is perpendicular to the magnetic field vector .",
    "we assumed already that the magnetic moments of the scatterer are aligned parallel to the optical axis @xmath35 in the strong magnetic field ( @xmath48 2 t ) of the objective lens of the microscope .",
    "we can now evaluate the ddscs for specimens showing magnetic circular dichroism .    if in eq .",
    "[ ddscsinter ] we write the phase shift @xmath49 explicitly as @xmath50 , inspection of eq .",
    "[ sfinal ] then reveals that a phase shift @xmath51 between the two incident plane waves is needed in order to activate the imaginary part of the mdff .",
    "a phase shift of @xmath52 is recommended since in this case the real part of the mdff disappears in eq .",
    "[ ddscsinter ] , and only the imaginary part survives . in a two - beam case with",
    "such a phase shift the pseudovector part contributes with its full magnitude and gives rise to an asymmetry in the scattering cross section of a magnetic transition such as the l edges of the ferromagnetic d - metals .",
    "we performed our experiment on a co single crystal electropolished sample with a fei tecnai f20-fegtem s - twin operating at 200 kev and equipped with a gatan imaging filter ( gif ) .",
    "the dichroic signal is obtained by first tilting out of the [ 0001 ] zone axis to a two - beam case where only the @xmath53 and @xmath54 reflections are strongly excited . following the procedure illustrated in @xcite , a selected area aperture ( saa )",
    "is used to delimit a region of about 100 nm radius and 18  @xmath55  3  nm thickness . the corresponding diffraction pattern is then projected onto the 2 mm spectrometer entrance aperture ( sea ) . drawing a circle with a diameter of g with the 0- and g - reflections on the left and right side respectively",
    ", the strongest dichroic signal can be expected at the top and bottom points a and b of this thales circle ( fig .  [ diff ] ) where the scalar product @xmath56 is zero and the pseudovector @xmath57 maximises the imaginary part of the mdff .",
    "the camera lenght and projection coils are then adjusted so that the sea will be centered at these two points ( first a , then b ) in the thales circle and determine a collection angle of 2 - 4 mrad .",
    "two spectra are then acquired sequentially ( fig .  [ cospectraold ] ) .",
    "with an acquisition time of 60 sec per spectrum and an energy dispersion of 0.5 ev / channel the intensity at the @xmath58 peak was about 2,500 counts ( after background removal ) .    .",

    "as detailed above , the sample is tilted out of the [ 0001 ] zone axis to a two - beam case where only the @xmath53 and @xmath54 reflections are observed in the the energy filtered diffraction pattern , which is then projected onto the spectrometer entrance aperture ( sea ) . using a rotational sample holder , the reciprocal lattice vector @xmath61",

    "this first modification allows us to record not only both spectra a and b with a single acquisition , but the entire range of spectra with different @xmath63 values comprised within the 2 mm sea .",
    "it should be noted however that the integration area in the @xmath62 dimension is different for every value of @xmath64 .    a second modification consists in a different method @xcite to obtain a spot like inelastic diffraction pattern : the beam ( with a convergence semi - angle of @xmath65  mrad ) is focussed onto a 18  @xmath55  3  nm thick area of the co specimen which is then shifted upwards from the eucentric position by @xmath66 m .",
    "the diameter of the illuminated area is @xmath67  nm , accurate to 5% , in the present experiment ( fig .",
    "[ fig0-dichro0 ] ) .",
    "preliminary experiments show that with smaller @xmath68-shifts the illuminated area can be reduced to less than 10 nm radius , at the moment with untenable distortions of the diffraction pattern . with a c@xmath69 corrector or a monochromator a spatial resolution of 10  nm or less",
    "should be attainable .",

    "bragg scattering will cause a diffraction pattern to appear in the image plane . ]    similarly to xmcd we define @xmath72 as the difference between spectra with opposite helicity and @xmath73 as their average .",
    "the dichroic signal is then the relative difference @xmath74 in the scattering cross section when the sign of the pseudovector part changes  .",

    "the modified scattering geometry provides a count rate per ev which is an order of magnitude higher than the one achieved in the previous configuration  @xcite , thus improving significantly the signal to noise ratio .",
    "this is essentially caused by the fact that when no saa is used and the beam is focussed only on the area of interest , all the electrons emitted from the gun contribute to the detected signal . in the formerly used geometry",
    "a nearly parallel incident bundle illuminated a large area of the sample of which only a small fraction could be used .",
    "this effectively reduced the intensity by which the area of interest is illuminated , _",
    "i.e. _ a large part of the incident electrons did not contribute to the signal .",
    "the increase in the count rate per ev allows us to reduce the acquisition time , thus limiting the effects of beam instability , specimen and energy drift .",
    "the shorter acquisition time , combined with the finer energy dispersion , improves the energy resolution with which the @xmath60 edges are recorded . in the older setup",

    "the effects of thickness , tilt of the incident beam , position of the detector were included as well as the integration over @xmath62 in the range dictated by the use of a circular sea .",
    "up to 8 beams were used for the calculations of the mdffs . a comparison with the experiment is given in fig .",
    "[ intqyline ] for the @xmath58 edge of cobalt .",
    "the agreement is very good between -0.8 and 0.8 g with some discrepancy appearing at larger scattering angles .",
    "this can be due to the faint bragg spots outside the systematic row ( which are neglected in the simulations ) and to the fact that the sea is not exactly in the spectral plane of the energy filter .",
    "the error bars correspond to the ( @xmath76 ) poissonian noise calculated for the theoretical signal using the number of electrons contributing to the signal as determined from the experimental data .",
