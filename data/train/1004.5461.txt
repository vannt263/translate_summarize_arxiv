    "single - molecule magnet ( smm ) systems attract more and more attention because they can be used to make devices for spintronic applications @xcite , quantum computing @xcite , high - density magnetic information storage @xcite etc @xcite .",

    "the step - wise structure is attributed to landau - zener ( lz ) quantum tunneling effect @xcite .",
    "this stimulates intensive study on lz model and its variants @xcite .",

    "however , it is difficult to consider thermal effects in these approaches to obtain satisfactory magnetization curves comparable to experimental results .    in this paper",
    ", we shall combine the classical thermal effects with the quantum lz tunneling effects in a dynamical monte carlo ( dmc ) framework @xcite in order to produce satisfactory magnetization curves comparable to experimental results .",
    "we consider ideal tetragonal body - centered lattices and use the giant spin approximation for spins of smms .",
    "we consider magnetic dipolar interactions , but neglect other factors such as defects , disorders , and misalignments between the easy axis and applied magnetic field .",
    "we calculate spin reversal probabilities from thermal - activated barrier hurdling , direct lz tunneling effect , and thermal - assisted lz tunneling effects in the presence of sweeping magnetic fields , and thereby derive a unified probability expression for any temperature and any sweeping field . taking the mn@xmath0 as example ,",
    "we do systematical dmc simulations with various temperatures and sweeping rates .",
    "the step structure appears in our simulated low - temperature magnetization curves , and our simulated magnetization curves are semi - quantitatively consistent with corresponding experimental results on those good mn@xmath0 systems ( with less disorders ) in the presence of little misalignments between the easy axis and applied fields @xcite .",
    "interplays of the lz tunneling effect , the thermal effects , and the magnetic dipolar interactions are elucidated .",

    "the leftward shift of the @xmath224 peak can be attributed to dipolar - interaction - induced ferromagnetic orders in rod - like systems @xcite , and the similar rightward shift to dipolar - interaction - induced antiferromagnetic orders in slab - like systems . because dipolar interactions are the only inter - smm interactions in our model , the differences of distributions between the the five lattices are caused by the dipolar fields , or dipolar interactions in essence .",
    "in summary , we have combined the thermal effects with the lz quantum tunneling effects in a dmc framework by using the giant spin approximation for spins of smms and considering magnetic dipolar interactions for comparison with experimental results .",
    "we consider ideal lattices of smms consistent with experimental ones and assume that there are no defects and axis - misalignments therein .",
    "we calculate spin reversal probabilities from thermal - activated barrier hurdling , direct lz tunneling effect , and thermal - assisted lz tunneling effects in the presence of sweeping magnetic fields . taking the parameters of experimental mn@xmath0 crystals , we do systematical dmc simulations with various temperatures and sweeping rates .",
    "our results show that the step structures can be clearly seen in the low - temperature magnetization curves , the thermally activated barrier hurdling becomes dominating at high temperature near 3k , and the thermal - assisted tunneling effects play important roles at the intermediate temperature .",
    "these are consistent with corresponding experimental results on good mn@xmath0 samples ( with less disorders ) in the presence of little misalignments between the easy axis and applied fields @xcite , and therefore our magnetization curves are satisfactory .",
    "furthermore , our dmc results show that the magnetic dipolar interactions , with the thermal effects , have important effects on the lz magnetization tunneling effects .",
    "their longitudinal parts can partially break the resonance conditions of the lz tunnelings and their transverse parts can modify the tunneling probabilities .",
    "they can clearly manifest themselves when the smm crystal is extremely rod - like or slab - like .",
    "however , both the magnetic dipolar interactions and the lz tunneling effects have little effects on the magnetization curves when the temperature is near 3k .",
