    "modern observational programs  including type ia supernovae , cosmic microwave background anisotropy , and mass power spectrum observations @xcite  indicate that the universe is expanding with an acceleration that is dominated to about 70% by a peculiar kind of matter called dark energy ( characterized by negative values of the pressure - to - density ratio @xmath1 ) , while the remaining 30% consists of baryonic and nonbaryonic visible and dark matter .",
    "the simplest way to describe this dark energy is through the use of quintessence ( @xmath2 ) or a phantom scalar field ( @xmath3 ) instead of a canonical one , that is , a scalar with a negative sign for the kinetic term in the lagrangian @xcite .",
    "the values @xmath4 should be noted because they seem to be not only admissible but even preferable for describing an increasing acceleration , which follows from the most recent estimates : @xmath5 @xcite ( according to the 7-year wmap data ) and @xmath6 @xcite ( mainly from data on type ia supernovae from the snls3 sample ) .",
    "thus , @xmath7 is commonly admitted by observations as a possible dark energy model . through this connection ,",
    "cosmological models with phantom scalar fields have gained considerable attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "if such a phantom scalar is part of the real field content of our universe , it is natural to seek its manifestations not only in cosmology but in local phenomena as well , in particular in black hole physics such as dark energy accretion onto black holes @xcite , black hole interactions with a phantom shell @xcite , the existence of regular black holes from a system of gravity coupled to these phantom fields @xcite , etc .",
    "how do we test these phantom fields ?",
    "the best approach would be gravitational lensing , as its resolution ratio is many orders of magnitude higher than any artificial telescope @xcite .",
    "gravitational lenses are now used to determine the hubble constant @xcite , probe the structure of a galaxies @xcite , measure the density of cosmic strings @xcite , and restrict the density factor of the universe @xcite .",
    "microlensing  such as that arising from stars and black holes  are used to probe dark matter and dark energy in the galactic halo @xcite , etc .",
    ", so we can use it here to probe the existence and distribution of dark energy via the influence of a phantom scalar on the gravitational field , i.e. , on a black hole lens behavior .    the earlier studies of gravitational lensing were developed in the weak - field approximation @xcite@xcite .",
    "it is enough for us to investigate the properties of gravitational lensing by ordinary stars and galaxies .",
    "however , when the lens is a black hole , a strong - field treatment of gravitational lensing @xcite is needed instead .",
    "virbhadra and ellis @xcite found that near the line connecting the source and the lens , an observer would detect two infinite sets of faint relativistic images on each side of the black hole .",
    "these relativistic images could provide a profound verification of alternative theories of gravity .",
    "thus , the study of strong gravitational lensing has become appealing in recent years . on the basis of the virbhadra - ellis lens equation @xcite",
    ", bozza @xcite extended the analytical method of lensing for a general class of static and spherically symmetric spacetimes and showed that the logarithmic divergence of the deflection angle at the photon sphere is a common feature .",
    "@xcite@xcite considered the gibbons - maeda - garfinkle - horowitz - strominger black hole lensing .",
    "et al _ @xcite studied the reissner - nordstrm black hole lensing .",
    "konoplya @xcite studied the corrections to the deflection angle and time delay of black hole lensing immersed in a uniform magnetic field .",

    "modern observations show that the universe is expanding with an acceleration that is dominated by a peculiar kind of matter ( e.g. , dark energy ) which can be modeled by quintessence or phantom scalar fields .",
    "this unknown matter has unusual properties such as negative values of the pressure - to - density ratio .",
    "if it exists , then it will inevitably affect the known spacetimes such as black hole physics .",
    "studying strong gravitational lensing can help us probe its existence and properties from astronomical observations .",

    "our results show that with an increase of the phantom constant @xmath0 both the minimum impact parameter @xmath32 and the angular position of the relativistic images @xmath33 increase , which contrary to the case of reissner - norstrm black hole lensing with an electric charge @xmath34 . the photon sphere @xmath35 and relative magnitudes @xmath36 stay the same as those of a schwarzschild black hole and are independent on @xmath0 , which is also contrary to the case where they are weakened by an electric charge .",
    "however , the deflect angle @xmath37 and the angular separation @xmath38 appear to have similar behavior as in reissner - norstrm lensing . this may offer a way to distinguish a phantom black hole from a reissner - norstrm one using the astronomical instruments developed in the future .",
    "our results also show the effects of dark energy in the considered model , such as ( i ) compressing the usual black hole and more powerfully attracting photons , ( ii ) making the relativistic einstein ring larger than the usual black hole , and ( iii ) not weakening the usual relative magnitudes , which will facilitate observations .",
