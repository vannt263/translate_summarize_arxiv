    "the scattering by electrons of low - energy photons ( @xmath0 ) is important in astrophysical situations only under the rather special circumstance that the electron - scattering opacity is not too much smaller than that from all other sources .",
    "thomson scattering in these cases has traditionally been regarded as coherent in frequency , and much work on spectrum formation has been based on this assumption . however ,",
    "if the spectrum of the object in questions contains features with a width less than or comparable to the electron doppler width , such as strong lines and continuum edges , the scattering may have to be treated as noncoherent , i.e. the change in the frequency of the scattered photon by the electron doppler effect must be taken into account ( mnch @xcite , hummer & mihalas @xcite , auer & mihalas @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "although the description of this redistribution process as a convolution of the mean intensity @xmath1 with a redistribution function is simple in principle , its inclusion in numerical calculations leads to considerable difficulties in practice for three reasons .",
    "1 ) the scale of the redistribution in frequency is much larger than the atomic doppler line widths ; 2 ) the evaluation of the convolution at each frequency involves an integration over a wide band of surrounding frequencies ; 3 ) this coupling of frequencies conflicts with the basic strategy of approximate lambda iteration ( ali ) methods which involve a frequency - by - frequency evaluation of the approximate lambda operator .",
    "the transfer equation for two level systems accounting for noncoherent electron scattering have been solved in various approximation by a number of workers .",
    "early work on this problem was based on the formulation in terms of a `` reversing layer '' by chandrasekar ( @xcite ) , who found a solution for the case in which the reddening of scattered photons arising from the compton effect was included .",
    "subsequently mnch ( @xcite ) considered the effects of electron doppler redistribution , again in terms of a `` reversing - layer '' model , by means of a fourier transform in frequency .",
    "this and other early work is summarized in chapter 12 of chandrasekhar ( @xcite ) .",
    "numerical solutions have been given for lines in the atmospheres of o - type stars by auer and mihalas ( @xcite , @xcite),who assumed complete redistribution for the atomic scattering .",
    "rangarajan et al ( @xcite ) give solutions for parameterized models with both both partial and complete redistribution in the line .",
    "hillier ( @xcite ) and hamann et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have included noncoherent electron scattering ( nes ) in computing the emergent line spectra of realistic models of wolf - rayet stars , for which the effects are clearly observable .",
    "however , in these works nes is included only during the formal solution for the emergent spectra , after the level populations have been fixed from an nlte solution in which nes has not been taken into account .    in this paper",
    "we develop a numerical method for the solution to radiative transfer problems in which noncoherent electron scattering can play an important role .",
    "the method is based on approximating the electron scattering redistribution function by a sum of exponentials .",
    "it is shown that only two exponential terms give a very accurate approximation .",
    "the electron scattering emissivity as a function of frequency at each point in the atmosphere then can be expressed through the solution to two simple differential equations in frequency space .",
    "the corresponding difference equations can be solved numerically by gaussian elimination .",
    "this procedure is easily included in any iterative solution of the combined radiative transfer and statistical equilibrium equations .",
    "in previous schemes for evaluating the nes emissivity , the computing time for each depth in the atmosphere scales as @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the number of frequency grid points , and @xmath4 is the number of frequency grid points needed to represent adequately the width of the electron redistribution function . for applications to spectral lines with structure on scales of both atomic and electron doppler widths , @xmath4 can be of order of 1050 or larger .",
    "the present method scales more favorably as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a small constant , independent of the frequency grid .",
    "it also automatically enforces exact conservation of photon number .",
    "in this paper we describe an implementation of our method of treating noncoherent electron scattering for the multilevel ali code mali ( rybicki & hummer , @xcite , @xcite ; hereafter rhi , rhii ) .",
    "in contrast to previous methods ( hillier @xcite , hamann et al .",
    "@xcite ) , full account is taken of the effect of nes on the level populations , as well as on the emergent spectrum .",
    "although the particular application described here is to mali , the method presented here is quite general and should be easily adaptable to other codes as well , especially ali codes .",
    "it should be made clear that in this latest generalization of mali noncoherent electron scattering is treated not fully by ali , but only by means of _ ordinary _ lambda iteration .",
    "this was not by choice , but resulted from a failure to find suitable approximate electron scattering operators to use in an ali method .",
    "in particular , we tried several approximate operators based on coherent scattering , which is already solved non - iteratively in mali .",
    "all of our choices were either unstable or had very poor convergence properties .",
    "fortunately , for many cases of interest , the mean number of photons scatterings due to electron scattering is very moderate , of order a few tens .",
    "since the typical number of iterations in an ali solution can be of order many tens to a hundred , the treatment of nes by ordinary lambda iteration in these cases will not substantially change the net number of iterations required for a solution .",
    "one should also note that numerical accelerators , such as ng s ( @xcite ) method , used in mali , act to improve the convergence of ordinary lambda iteration , as well as ali .",
    "however , for problems with mean numbers of scatterings of order of a hundred or more , the present method is simply not suitable , and other methods will have to be developed .    in sect .  2 we present the basic description of the electron redistribution problem . in sect",
    "3 we develop the approximate exponential fit to the electron scattering redistribution function and show how the emissivity can be found by solving two differential equations .",
    "we then give results illustrating the accuracy of our approximation and the basic features of two - level transfer problems including electron scattering treated as coherent and incoherent processes .",
    "4 describes the incorporation of our method into mali and gives results for a hot o - star atmosphere including noncoherent electron scattering .",
    "as expected , the effects on individual lines were quite noticeable , as were the effects within a few electron doppler widths of continua .",
    "however , we also found an unexpected and potentially important effect for certain continua , which , in the absence of noncoherent scattering , are strongly in absorption .",
    "then scattering of radiation from the stronger continuum below the edge into the other can cause a substantial anomalous ionization of material , and conseqently a substantial change in the radiation field across the entire ionizing continuum , not just in the neighborhood of the jump .",
    "the angle - averaged emissivity at frequency @xmath7 for unpolarized electron scattering in the non - relativistic limit can be written @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the thomson cross section and @xmath10 is the scattering integral , e ( ) r(,)j()d. here @xmath1 is the mean intensity , and @xmath11 is the unpolarized , angle - averaged electron scattering redistribution function .",

    "these changes have been made so that the resulting formulas apply for the whole spectrum , not just to a region in the neighborhood of a single line .",
    "it is appropriate in the non - relativistic limit that the redistribution process should depend primarily on the _ ratio _ of frequencies rather than the _ differences _ that appear in the hummer and mihalas formulas .",
    "this dependence on frequency ratio comes about because the compton energy shift is negligible in the non - relativistic limit and the energy shift of a photon in the scattering process is due solely to the doppler shifts into and out of the rest frame of the electron .",
    "( see , e.g. , rybicki & lightman @xcite ; sect .",

    "coherent scattering is usually a good approximation for continua , but it can fail badly in the neighborhood of lines and continuum edges , as we shall see .",

    "the surface flux is shown in fig .",
    "the largest differences between the results for coherent and noncoherent electron scattering are found in the regions around the  edge , the  edge and lyman @xmath54 , which are expanded in figs .  5 , 6 , and 7 , respectively .",

    "most conspicuous in figs .",
    "4 and 5 are the order of magnitude increase in the flux in the  continuum and the decrease in the flux just below the edge caused by the noncoherent electron scattering .",
    "these effects arise from the scattering by electrons of the intense radiation just below the edge into the threshold region where the photoionization cross section has its maximum .",
    "this increases the ionization rate of he@xmath56 by an order of magnitude , and thus shifts the ionization balance of he@xmath55 by the same amount . the resulting decrease in the populations of he@xmath55 and he@xmath56",
    "are clearly seen in fig .",
    "note that the additional flux in the  continuum arises not just from the photons scattering across the edge , but rather from those escaping from the atmosphere because the the  population is reduced .    the behavior at the  edge , shown in fig .",
    "6 , is completely different .",
    "now the only effect of noncoherent electron scattering is appearance of the `` spur '' just below the edge .",
    "this feature is caused by scattering of radiation from the lyman continuum , which throughout much of the atmosphere is strongly in emission , to the region just below the threshold .",
    "this occurs even in models for which the surface flux in the lyman continuum is in absorption .",
    "as no additional radiation is fed into the threshold region of the lyman continuum , and the amount lost is very small , the ionization balance is not significantly affected .",
    "the narrow emission wings of lyman @xmath54 shown in fig .  7 for coherent electron scattering are examples of the schuster effect .",
    "non - coherence reduces this effect by scattering the radiation into the very long wings .",
    "the slight deepening of the absorption feature arises because the radiation trapped in the line core is scatterd out into the wings .",
    "however , this effect is weak and in other cases the core is slightly shallower with non - coherence .",
    "the general behavior of some of the other spectral lines can be summarized as follows .",
    "the lyman @xmath57 line is similiar in appearance to lyman @xmath54 but less deep .",
    "the three  resonance lines and  lyman @xmath54 are entirely in absorption with broad , very shallow wings .",
    "balmer @xmath54 is weakly in absorption , as are most of the he subordinate lines , although a few line of  are weakly in emission with long shallow wings .",
    "all emission and absorption lines are weaker for noncoherent than for coherent electron scattering .",
    "the above effects are found to a reduced extent in the model with @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and are present only weakly in the model with @xmath60 , @xmath61 . the ionization equilibrium in the surface layers shifts by roughly factors of 3.5 and 1.7 , respectively .",
    "this shows that the decisive feature is the essentially complete ionization of the gas , so that the weak electron - scattering opacity is not completely overshadowed .",
    "it might also be objected that these phenomena will be radically reduced by the lines converging on the series limit . equating the electron doppler width to the ionization potential of a hydrogenic ion",
    "shows that the corresponding principal quantum number is approximately n^ * = 23.3t_4 ^ -1/4 , where @xmath62 .",
    "states with @xmath63 down to at least this value will be involved in shifting of photons in or out of the continuum .",
    "thus , two or three electron doppler widths at the temperatures considered here corresponds to a state below the region of confluence . in other words , radiation present below the line merging region",
    "will continue to cause additional ionization .",
    "the inclusion of metals is likely to reduce both the enhanced  emission and the  spur .",
    "however , for hot , low - gravity stars near the eddington limit , absorption by _ bound - free _ transitions of metal ions should not substantially reduce the shift of the ionization balance , as species with appreciable abundances have ground state ionization edges lying in the  continuum , and thus will themselves become more highly ionized , just as he itself .",
    "the effect of metal lines , on the other hand , is not easy to determine _ a priori_. the dense array of metal lines ( arising mostly from  and ) between the  and  continua illustrated in fig .",
    "14c of pauldrach et al ( @xcite ) for a _ plane parallel _ stellar model with @xmath64 and @xmath65 suggests that metal lines could reduce or quench entirely the additional ionization of he .",
    "more appropriate would be _ spherical _ models including wind effects  the so - called unified models ( gabler et al ( @xcite ) and references therein ) .",
    "these give fluxes in the  continuum larger than thoses in corresponding plane parallel models by some orders of magnitude , which would shift the ionization equilibria of the metals to higher stages ( the ionization potential of  is only 0.4 ev larger than that of ) .",
    "moreover , deep in atmosphere of a hot star , the line blocking shifts to higher frequencies , while the scattering of radiation into the  continuum persists .",
    "the combined effects of these mechanisms remains to be investigated .",
    "the main effects found here arise from the flow of radiation from deep hot parts of the atmosphere in relatively transparent parts of the spectrum , followed by scattering by electrons into the opaque regions , such as ionizing continuum and strong lines .",
    "such effects are not , of course , limited to stellar photospheres .",
    "winds of hot stars could be affected , as the scattering of radiation in continuua would allow ions to receive ionizing radiation from the photosphere which would otherwise be cut off by the increasing red - shift of the stellar radiation as seen by the material in the wind .",
    "clouds illuminated by an external source of ionizing radiation could also experience an increase in the degree of ionization by the same mechanism . whether or not these possibilities are realized in any particular case must be investigated .",

    "<S> since the mass of the electron is very small relative to atomic masses , thomson scattering of low - energy photons ( @xmath0 ) produces thermal doppler frequency shifts that are much larger than atomic doppler widths . </S>",
    "<S> a method is developed here to evaluate the electron scattering emissivity from a given radiation field which is considerably faster than previous methods based on straightforward evaluation of the scattering integral . </S>",
    "<S> this procedure is implemented in our multilevel radiative code ( mali ) , which now takes full account of the effects of noncoherent electron scattering on level populations , as well as on the emergent spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> calculations using model atmospheres of hot , low - gravity stars display not only the expected broad wings of strong emission lines but also effects arising from the scattering of photons across continuum edges . in extreme cases </S>",
    "<S> this leads to significant shifts of the ionization equilibrium of helium .    </S>",
