    "pair of spins.@xcite from the theoretical perspective , the emergence of the biquadratic interaction is natural when the system contains multiple orbitals and when the correlations are strong in the metallic ground state : the low - energy effective hamiltonian in the spin sector should consist of not only two - spin heisenberg interactions , such as @xmath12 and @xmath10 heisenberg exchange between n.n .",

    ", we have shown that the biquadratic interaction is crucial in understanding the spin dynamics in the paramagnetic phase of the parent iron pnictides.@xcite given the close correlations between magnetic excitations and the nearby superconductivity in the phase diagram , it would be equally interesting to ask how the biquadratic interaction may affect superconductivity in these materials .",

    "angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements find the superconducting gap to be nodeless and isotropic at both the hole and electron pockets in a number of materials  @xcite .",
    "neutron scattering measurements on these compounds observe a clear spin resonance mode in the superconducting state  @xcite .",
    "these are consistent with an @xmath5 pairing channel , with the pairing order parameter @xmath14 changing sign between the hole pockets near the brillouin zone ( bz ) center and the electron pockets near the zone corner , which arises within both weak - coupling and strong - coupling approaches  @xcite .",
    "recent experiments find evidences of anisotropic or even nodal superconducting gaps on several iron pnictide compounds in either underdoped or heavily doped regimes .",
    "for example , for the heavily hole doped compound kfe@xmath15as@xmath15 , thermal conductivity and penetration - depth measurements indicate the presence of nodes,@xcite suggesting a different pairing symmetry to its optimally doped counterpart.@xcite experimentally , the issue is not settled , with thermal conductivity measurements interpreted as evidence for the @xmath16-wave symmetry of the order parameter@xcite , consistent with predictions of the functional renormalization group  @xcite , whereas the arpes measurements are indicative of an extended @xmath17-wave state with accidental nodes.@xcite a recent arpes study of heavily hole - doped ba@xmath18k@xmath19fe@xmath15as@xmath15 found nodes in the small @xmath20 hole pockets off - centered around the @xmath21 point at the edge of the brillouin zone  @xcite .",
    "also in the underdoped nafeas and in the undoped lifeas , anisotropic but nodeless superconducting gaps along the fermi pockets have been identified.@xcite all these results question the validity of isotropic @xmath5 pairing in the underdoped and/or overdoped regimes .    in this paper , we study the superconducting states of a strong - coupling two - orbital @xmath22 model with electron doping using a slave - boson mean - field theory . by comparing to the results of a @xmath23 model ,",

    "the reason behind studying the two - orbital ( as opposed to the full five - orbital ) model is the universally accepted fact that the major contribution to the fermi surface comes from the iron @xmath26 orbitals ( @xmath27 ) , whereas the @xmath28 orbital weight is very small@xcite .",

    "but due to the different pairing symmetry , the nodes in @xmath118 and @xmath119 necessarily locate at different momenta .",
    "the quasiparticle gap is proportional to @xmath120 ^ 2+[\\mathrm{im}({\\tilde{v}}_{k\\gamma})]^2}$ ] , and is always nodeless .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed the superconducting phase diagram of the @xmath22 model at fixed hole or electron doping . we find that several phases with different pairing symmetries can be stabilized depending on the interactions . an important question with more experimental relevance is that of the pairing symmetry for realistic model parameters , and its doping dependence . in this section",

    "the overall pairing amplitudes are maximal at half - filling , which is understood because we only consider the superconducting pairing , but have ignored the magnetic order in the model .",
    "when @xmath129 is decreased toward half - filling , it is expected that the superconductivity is suppressed , and the ground state is eventually antiferromagnetic , as is found experimentally .",
