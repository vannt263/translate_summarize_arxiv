    "first passage percolation ( fpp ) was originally introduced by hammersley and welsh @xcite in 1965 as a model of fluid flow through a random medium .",
    "it has been a stage of research for probabilists since its origins but despite all efforts through the past decades , most of the predictions about its important statistics remain to be understood .",
    "most of the beauty of the model lies in its simple definition ( as a random metric space ) and the property that several of its fascinating conjectures do not require much effort to be stated . during these @xmath1 years",
    ", fpp brought attention of theoretical physicists , biologists , and computer scientists and also gave birth to some of the most classical tools in mathematics , the sub - additive ergodic theorem as one of the main examples . here",
    ", we will focus on the model defined on the lattice @xmath2 ; some variants will be discussed in section [ sec : alltheotherthings ] .",
    "the model is defined as follows .",
    "we place a non - negative random variable @xmath3 , called the _ passage time _ of the edge @xmath4 , at each nearest - neighbor edge in @xmath5 .",
    "the collection @xmath6 is assumed to be independent , identically distributed with common distribution @xmath7 and probability measure  @xmath8 .",
    "the random variable @xmath3 is interpreted as the time or the cost needed to traverse edge  @xmath4 .    a _ path _",
    "@xmath9 is a finite or infinite sequence of edges @xmath10 in @xmath5 such that for each @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 share exactly one endpoint . for any finite path @xmath9",
    "we define the _ passage time _ of @xmath9 to be @xmath14 given two points @xmath15 one then sets @xmath16 where the infimum is over all finite paths @xmath9 that contain both @xmath17 and @xmath18 , and @xmath17 is the unique vertex in @xmath19 such that @xmath20 ( similarly for @xmath18 ) . the random variable @xmath21 will be called the passage time between points @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in the original interpretation of the model , @xmath21 represents the time that a fluid with source in @xmath22 takes to reach a location @xmath23 .    for each @xmath24",
    "let @xmath25 in the case that @xmath26 , the pair @xmath27 is a metric space and @xmath28 is the ( random ) ball of radius @xmath29 around the origin .",
    "the ultimate goal of first passage percolation is to understand this metric as the observer moves away from @xmath2 or as we make the euclidean length of the edges small .",
    "a variety of questions comes to mind almost immediately .",
    "we write @xmath30 for the @xmath31 norm in @xmath32 .    1 .",
    "what is the typical distance between two points that are far from each other in the lattice ? or in other words , what can we say about @xmath21 as @xmath33 ?",
    "does it converge ? what is the rate of convergence ?",
    "how does a ball of large radius look ?",
    "do we have a scaling limit and fluctuation theory for the set @xmath34 ?",
    "3 .   what is the geometry of geodesics ( time - minimizing paths ) between two distant points ? how different they are from straight lines ? 4 .",
    "what role does the distribution of the passage times play in describing the metric ?    in this manuscript , we will discuss progress on these and related questions .",
    "the purpose is twofold .",
    "first , we hope that this set of notes will serve as a quick guide for readers who are not necessarily experts in the field .",
    "we will try to provide not only the main results but also the main techniques and a large collection of open problems .",
    "second , the field had a burst of activity in the past @xmath35 years and the most complete survey is more than a decade old .",
    "we hope that these notes will fill this gap . at least , we hope to share some of the beautiful mathematical ideas and constructions that arise through fpp and which have enchanted many throughout these years .",
    "let s now go back to questions @xmath36 to @xmath37 .",
    "the original paper of hammersley and welsh @xcite considered question @xmath36 for a class of passage times in @xmath38 .",
    "if we write @xmath39 for the first coordinate vector , they showed that @xmath40 grows linearly in @xmath41 .",
    "their result was extended in the famous paper of kingman @xcite .",
    "it was also the building block for the classical `` shape theorem '' of richardson @xcite , improved by cox and durrett @xcite and kesten @xcite that gives the analogue of the law of large numbers for the random ball @xmath34 .",
    "it roughly says that @xmath34 grows linearly in @xmath29 and , when normalized , it converges to a deterministic subset @xmath42 of @xmath32 , called the limit shape .",
    "the set @xmath42 is not universal and depends on the distribution of the passage times .",
    "section [ sec : limitshape ] is devoted to explaining the shape theorem and certain properties of the limit shape @xmath42 .    in section [ sec : fluctuations ] we discuss the variance and the order of fluctuations of the passage time @xmath43 .",
    "in two dimensions , it is expected that under certain assumptions on @xmath42 the fluctuations are governed by the predictions of physicists , including kardar , parisi , zhang @xcite . in higher dimensions ,",
    "the picture is less clear and some of the predictions disagree . after stating what is conjectured , we focus our attention on presenting a simple proof of sub linear variance valid under minimal assumptions on the passage time .",
    "section [ sec : geodesics ] is devoted to the study of geodesics .",
    "we briefly discuss the existence of finite geodesics between any two points , then move to the study of geodesic rays .",
    "we present results on coalescence , directional properties and we sketch the proof of the absence of geodesic lines ( or bigeodesics ) in the upper half plane .",
    "the important connection between geodesic lines and ground states of the two - dimensional ising ferromagnet is also presented .    in section [ sec : busemann ] we describe the modern role of busemann functions .",
    "we explain a beautiful argument by hoffman for the existence of @xmath44 or more geodesic rays .",
    "we then focus on busemann function limits and the relation to limiting geodesic graphs .",
    "section [ sec : growth ] tries to cover the vast relation between fpp , growth processes and infection models .",
    "we focus on questions of coexistence of multiple species and the limiting interface .",
    "section [ sec : alltheotherthings ] is our attempt to show the reader what this survey is not about . in the literature , there are thousands of pages of related ( equally fascinating ) questions and models , similar to or inspired by fpp .",
    "we collect a few of these directions and try to point the right references . in particular , we briefly discuss fpp on different graphs , the maximum flow problem , the exactly solvable models for last passage percolation and the positive temperature version of the model .",

    "the first - order of growth of the passage time @xmath40 is described by the following theorem .",

    "we will consider the same model in @xmath2 with @xmath2418 different species .",
    "vertices @xmath2419 and at time @xmath2415 , infect site @xmath2420 by an infection of type @xmath720 . each species spreads at unit speed as before , taking time @xmath230 to cross an edge @xmath4 .",
    "an uninhabited site is exclusively and permanently colonized by the first species that reaches it ; that is , @xmath2421 is occupied at time @xmath29 by the @xmath720-th species if @xmath2422 and @xmath2423 for all @xmath2424 .",
    "if multiple @xmath2420 s try to colonize a site at the same time ( an event that happens with probability @xmath66 if the passage time distribution is continuous ) , we use some rule to break ties .",
    "now , consider the set colonized by the @xmath720-th species starting at vertex @xmath2420 : @xmath2425 we are interested in describing the geometry of these random sets . in particular ,",
    "much of the research so far has been driven to answer the following questions :    1 .",
    "can multiple species simultaneously succeed in invading an infinite subset of the lattice ?",
    "in other words , does coexistence occur ? 2 .   assuming coexistence of at least two species , what can we say about the boundary interface ?",
    "does it have an asymptotic direction ? a possible scaling limit ?",
    "3 .   what happens if one species moves with faster speed than the others ?",
    "can we show that coexistence is impossible ?",
    "these questions will be discussed in the following sections .      before describing previous work ,",
    "let s be precise and put the above questions on solid ground .",
    "we start with the first question on coexistence .",
    "recall that @xmath8 denotes the probability measure of the passage times .",
    "one says that @xmath8 _ admits coexistence of @xmath282 species _ if for some choice of initial sites @xmath2426 , @xmath2427 the first point to make is that the choice of the initial sites is not important .",
    "one just needs to make sure that with positive probability , a new set of initial sites @xmath2428 are respectively infected by the initial sites @xmath2429 .",
    "when the passage times are exponentially distributed , this can be easily done using the markov property ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* propositon 1.1 ) , when @xmath2430 ) .",
    "when the passage times are not exponentially distributed , this modification argument follows the same lines as those described in section @xmath535 and can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 5 and 6 ) .",
    "one therefore has the following proposition :    [ prop : initialsites ] assume that the measure @xmath8 is non - atomic and the @xmath2431 .",
    "suppose that @xmath2432 and @xmath2433 are points in @xmath2 such that there exists disjoint paths from @xmath2420 to @xmath1796",
    ". then @xmath2434    the proposition above deals with choosing the initial sites .",
    "one has a similar result if starting with @xmath282 different infected sets instead of single points @xcite .",
    "however , the key and difficult step to prove coexistence is to establish that there indeed exist sources such that occurs .",
    "heuristically , the shape theorem gives the intuition that the larger the distance between the sources , the harder it is for one infection to surround the other one .",
    "if one hopes to prove that holds , then the best strategy is to choose the sources far from each other and hope that their infections will grow at least in different directions .",
    "this gives an indication that coexistence is strongly related to the existence of distinct geodesic rays with different asymptotic directions .",
    "we will explore this avenue in a few moments .",
    "first , let us briefly say what is the state of the art on question 1 above .",
    "when @xmath8 is the exponential distribution , hggstrm and pemantle @xcite proved coexistence of 2 species ( one could also see @xcite for a review of results on richardson models , focused on exponential passage times ) . shortly thereafter , garet and marchand @xcite and hoffman @xcite independently extended these results to prove coexistence of 2 species for a broad class of translation - invariant measures , including some non - i.i.d .",
    "later , hoffman @xcite demonstrated coexistence of @xmath37 species in @xmath165 for a similarly broad class of measures by establishing a relation with the number of sides of the limit shape in the associated fpp . tying the question of coexistence with",
    "the number of sides of the limit shape is a very neat argument that we try to sketch below .",
    "recall that the number of sides of the limit shape @xmath1743 is equal to @xmath282 if @xmath1844 is a polygon with @xmath282 sides .",
    "if @xmath1844 is not a polygon , the number of sides is defined to be infinity .    [ hoof ]",
    "suppose that @xmath1743 is bounded , @xmath2435 for some @xmath2436 , and that @xmath8 is uniquely geodesic .",
    "if the number of sides of @xmath1743 is at least @xmath282 then for any @xmath486 there exist @xmath2426 such that @xmath2437    j .- b .",
    "gour has extended these methods to give a geometric description of invaded regions ; see @xcite .",
    "we now sketch the proof of the above theorem .",
    "step 1 - _ moving to busemann functions .",
    "_    we start the proof by some geometric considerations .",
    "let the set @xmath1564 consist of all @xmath2438 such that there is a unique line @xmath2439 which is tangent to @xmath1743 through @xmath192 .",
    "for such a @xmath192 , let @xmath2440 be a unit vector parallel to @xmath2439 .",
    "let @xmath2441 be the line through @xmath2442 in the direction of @xmath2440 .",
    "it is not difficult to see that if the number of sides of @xmath1844 is at least @xmath282 then one can find points @xmath2443 such that the lines @xmath2444 are distinct for all @xmath720 .",
    "fix such @xmath2445 s from now on .",
    "the first step is to establish the following lemma .",
    "define the busemann - type function @xmath2446 for @xmath2142 and @xmath2447 as @xmath2448 from the subadditivity of @xmath43 and the definition of @xmath2449 , we have @xmath2450 and @xmath2451 these busemann functions are useful because of the following fact .",
    "assume that the number of sides of @xmath1743 is at least @xmath282 and let @xmath2452 be defined as above .",
    "if there exist @xmath2453 , and @xmath1747 such that @xmath2454 for infinitely many @xmath41 , then holds .",
    "it is easy to be convinced that such lemma must be true .",
    "recall that geometrically @xmath2455 is roughly given by the orthogonal projection of the vector @xmath2456 on the line orthogonal to @xmath2457 .",
    "if for all @xmath2458 , @xmath2459 then roughly speaking @xmath1922 is closer than @xmath1912 is to the line @xmath2460 and the species @xmath36 will infect in the direction orthogonal to @xmath2460 .",
    "precisely , if for all @xmath2458 @xmath2461 then one can find @xmath2462 such that @xmath2463 for all @xmath2464 .",
    "thus the species @xmath36 will infect infinitely many sites . repeating the same argument for the other species ,",
    "we obtain exactly what we want .",
    "step 2 - _ the density argument .",
    "_ now , to end the proof of theorem [ hoof ] , one needs to construct points @xmath2465 such that holds . the idea is to choose @xmath2466 with @xmath155 large enough .",
    "the proof then boils down to proving the following stronger statement .",
    "there exists @xmath90 such that for all @xmath490 there exists @xmath155 such that the density of @xmath41 with @xmath2467 is at least @xmath2468 .",
    "we sketch the argument here .",
    "the idea is that @xmath2469 for large @xmath155 behaves as @xmath2470 where @xmath313 is a linear functional with null space in direction @xmath2471 such that @xmath2472 .",
    "precisely , for each pair @xmath2473 with @xmath2474 we will find @xmath2475 and @xmath90 ( depending on the angle between the points @xmath1134 and @xmath2476 ) such that for all large enough @xmath155 the events : @xmath2477 and @xmath2478 happen with probability @xmath2479 in a set of values of @xmath41 with density at least @xmath2468 . then implies @xmath2480 establishing and was the central part hoffman s paper ( see lemma 4.4 , 4.5 in @xcite ) and these have much in common with finding the mean of the busemann function ( see lemma [ lem : todayisaniceday ] ) . for , hoffman developed his averaging trick , which was explained in lemma [ lem : expected_busemann_simple ] in section [ sec : busemann ] .",
    "the proof of relies on the assumption that the limit shape is differentiable at @xmath1134 .",
    "coexistence of infinitely many species is defined similarly and clearly implies coexistence of @xmath282 species for any @xmath282 . in @xcite , damron and",
    "hochman extended the above theorem to include the case @xmath2481 and used it to construct a first example of a passage time distribution that admits infinite coexistence .",
    "the current state of the art is given by a combination of theorem [ hoof ] and theorem [ thm : diffll ] .",
    "it establishes that infinite coexistence is not only possible but is necessary for all measures in @xmath354 :    [ thm : infinitecoexistence ] if @xmath359 for @xmath381 then @xmath8 admits coexistence of infinitely many species .",
    "if two species have two different growth rules , with one faster than the other , one may expect that non - coexistence occurs with probability @xmath36 .",
    "we try to make this precise in this section .",
    "we first consider the original case treated in @xcite , where the passage times are exponentially distributed .",
    "we restrict ourselves to the case of @xmath44 infections .",
    "the model now has two parameters , denoted by @xmath2482 and @xmath2483 , indicating the intensities of the infections .",
    "we assume that @xmath2484 so species @xmath36 spreads faster than species @xmath44 .",
    "the infection rule is the same as in the last section .",
    "we start with one infected site of each species .",
    "an uninfected site becomes type @xmath720 infected at a rate proportional to the number of type @xmath720 infected nearest neighbors and then stays type @xmath720 for the rest of its life .",
    "the best result to date in this case is still from the original paper @xcite . with one of the intensities fixed ,",
    "coexistence has probability @xmath66 for all but at most countably many values of the other intensity .",
    "it is however expected that this should be true for all values of @xmath2485 .",
    "show that for all values of @xmath2485 and all @xmath2486 , @xmath2487    it is worth mentioning that at this point , we are still left in the embarrassing situation where we know that for almost every value of @xmath2483 , coexistence does not occur , but we are unable to exhibit any single value of @xmath2483 such that coexistence actually does not happen .",
    "a possible way to answer this conjecture is to show :    fix @xmath2482 .",
    "show that the event @xmath2488 is monotone in @xmath2483 .",
    "monotonicity is believed to hold on @xmath2 , although there are examples of graphs where such a statement does not hold @xcite . as in proposition",
    "[ prop : initialsites ] , the initial placement of the infections does not matter and one could start with any bounded initial sets .",
    "certain special cases where one of the initial sets is unbounded ( a half - space against a point , for instance ) are treated in @xcite and extended in @xcite .    as in section",
    "[ sec : growthr ] , one can define competition with different speeds using more general passage times .",
    "this was studied by garet and marchand in @xcite , where they extended the results of @xcite when the passage time distributions for the two species are stochastically comparable . under certain conditions on the passage times , in this setting , they established in any dimension @xmath351 that if the slow species survives , the fast species can not occupy a very high density of space . for @xmath1518 , they show that almost surely , one species must finally occupy a set of full density in the plane while the other species occupies only a set of null density .      before ending the chapter , it is worth mentioning that in the past twenty years , there has also been a growing interest in questions related to the asymptotic shape of infected regions .    in the physics literature ,",
    "derrida and dickman @xcite describe simulations for the eden model in which two clusters grow into a vacant sector of the plane with angle @xmath1770 .",
    "they obtain values for the roughening exponents of the competition interface depending on the angle .",
    "two species competition with mutation and selection was also studied numerically in the eden model in a paper by kuhr , leisner and frey @xcite ( see the references therein for other variations of the model ) .    however , precise results are scarce , except for solvable models of last passage percolation , where there is a coupling between the competition interface and the second class particle in tasep @xcite .",
    "one of the main difficulties ( again ! ) in the case of fpp is the lack of knowledge of the limit shape @xmath217 .",
    "one way to define the competition interface is as follows ( see figure [ figcompetition ] ) . for a given @xmath2489 consider the sets @xmath2490 and @xmath2491 blue and red are the initial infected sites .",
    "we now color a vertex @xmath192 in @xmath2492 blue if @xmath2493 and red otherwise .",
    "if the passage time distribution is continuous , almost surely there will be no ties and a color will be assigned to each vertex of @xmath38 .",
    "the competition interface is the unique path on the dual lattice that sits between the blue and red regions . now for @xmath2494 define @xmath2495 and let the width of the interface at absissa @xmath22 be defined as @xmath2496 for @xmath22 large , @xcite predicted that the function @xmath2497 has power law behavior with exponent @xmath2498 where @xmath2499 as far as we know , none of these questions were investigated except in the case of lpp with exponential weights . some recent result in this exactly solvable case",
    "were also obtained in @xcite .",
    "in this section , we discuss a sequence of related questions that were not addressed in the previous sections .",
    "they all share something in common : they are all variants of a first - passage percolation model . here",
    "we try to summarize the most well - studied connections and variants for the reader ; however , we refer to the papers for their proofs and methodologies .",
    "the maximum flow problem can be considered a higher - dimensional version of first - passage percolation , where the passage times @xmath2500 play the role of the maximal amount of fluid that can go through an edge @xmath4 per unit of time . consider an open bounded connected subset @xmath2501 of @xmath32 such that the boundary @xmath2502 is piecewise of class @xmath2503 .",
