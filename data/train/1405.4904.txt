    "the rare , doubly radiative decay @xmath9 attracts much interest due to large uncertainties in the experimental data and in the calculations based on chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath10pth ) . in many cases",
    ", @xmath10pth provides a good description of the low - energy dynamics of light pseudoscalar mesons using an expansion in powers of small meson masses and momenta  @xcite .",
    "the uncertainties in @xmath10pth calculations for the @xmath0 transition are related to the fact that the tree - level amplitudes of the lowest orders @xmath11 ( order two in particle four - momentum or masses ) and @xmath12 vanish .",
    "the first non - zero contribution comes at @xmath12 either from loops involving kaons , strongly suppressed owing to large kaon masses , or from pion loops , suppressed as they violate g parity .",
    "the major contribution to the @xmath0 decay amplitude comes from the @xmath13 counterterms that are needed in @xmath10pth to cancel various divergences .",
    "the coefficients of these counterterms are not determined by @xmath10pth itself ; they have to be either adjusted by fitting a model to experimental data or estimated using model assumptions , e.g. vector - meson dominance ( vmd ) or nambu - jona - lasinio models  @xcite . since light vector mesons",
    "play a critical role in these models , the dynamical role of the vector mesons has to be included systematically  @xcite to reach a deeper understanding of the @xmath0 decay as well as photon - fusion reactions into pseudoscalar mesons ( e.g. , @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .    to test the models based on @xmath10pth or to provide an input for adjusting their parameters , one has to measure both the decay rate for @xmath0 and its dalitz plot , the features of which reflect the decay amplitude .",
    "the experimental challenges in measuring @xmath16 are formidable because of the smallness of its decay rate in conjuction with large background contributions .",
    "this makes the direct measurement of the @xmath0 dalitz plot very difficult ; it is easier to measure the @xmath8 distribution instead .",
    "the first results on measuring the @xmath8 dependence , obtained by the crystal ball ( cb ) collaboration at the ags and by the a2 collaboration at mami - b , were presented in refs .",

    "these parameters were fitted to the data of three well - known photon - fusion reactions and to existing @xmath8 data  @xcite .",
    "the results of that study show good agreement with existing data for photon - fusion reactions and predict cross sections for poorer known photon - fusion processes .",
    "this article presents a new measurement of the @xmath8 dependence by the a2 collaboration at mami .",
    "the results obtained are based on the analysis of @xmath4 decays from a total of @xmath5 @xmath6 mesons produced in the @xmath7 reaction , allowing the experimental uncertainties in measuring the @xmath9 decay to be decreased .",
    "the @xmath8 results presented in this work were also used to repeat the analysis of photon - fusion reactions  @xcite .",
    "the process @xmath19 was measured using the crystal ball ( cb )  @xcite as the central spectrometer and taps  @xcite as a forward spectrometer .",
    "these detectors were installed in the energy - tagged bremsstrahlung photon beam of the mainz microtron ( mami )  @xcite .",
    "the photon energies were determined using the glasgow - mainz tagging spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "the cb detector is a sphere consisting of 672 optically isolated nai(tl ) crystals , shaped as truncated triangular pyramids , which point toward the center of the sphere .",
    "the crystals are arranged in two hemispheres that cover 93% of @xmath20 , sitting outside a central spherical cavity with a radius of 25  cm , which holds the target and inner detectors . in this experiment , taps was arranged in a plane consisting of 384 baf@xmath21 counters of hexagonal cross section . it was installed 1.5  m downstream of the cb center and covered the full azimuthal range for polar angles from @xmath22 to @xmath23 .",

    "bremsstrahlung photons , produced by the 1508-mev electrons in a 10-@xmath24 m cu radiator and collimated by a 4-mm - diameter pb collimator , were incident on a 5-cm - long liquid hydrogen ( lh@xmath21 ) target located in the center of the cb .",
    "the energies of the incident photons were analyzed up to 1402  mev by detecting the post - bremsstrahlung electrons in the glasgow - mainz tagger  @xcite . with the 1557-mev electron beam ,",
    "the incident photons were analyzed up to 1448  mev , and a 10-cm - long lh@xmath21 target was used . the uncertainty in the energy of the tagged photons is mainly determined by the width of tagger focal - plane detectors and the energy of the mami electron beam used in the experiments . for the mami energies of 1508 and 1557  mev , such an uncertainty was about @xmath25  mev .",
    "the target was surrounded by a particle identification ( pid ) detector  @xcite used to distinguish between charged and neutral particles .",
    "it was made of 24 scintillator bars ( 50 cm long , 4 mm thick ) arranged as a cylinder with a radius of 12 cm .",
    "the experimental trigger in the measurement with the 1508-mev electron beam required the total energy deposited in the cb to exceed @xmath26320  mev and the number of so - called hardware clusters in the cb ( multiplicity trigger ) to be larger than two .",
    "depending on the data - taking period , events with cluster multiplicity two were prescaled with a different rate .",
    "taps was not in the multiplicity trigger for these experiments . with the 1557-mev electron beam",

    "more details on the experimental conditions during the measurements with the 1508-mev electron beam in 2007 are given in refs .",
    "to search for a signal from @xmath9 decay , candidates for the process @xmath27 were extracted from the analysis of events having five clusters ( four from the photons and one from the proton ) reconstructed in the cb and taps together .",
    "four - cluster events , with only four photons detected , were neglected in the present analysis as the probability of non - detecting the final - state proton for the process @xmath28 in these experiments was only about 20% . also , for such events , the proton information missing in the analysis resulted in a much stronger background contamination .",
    "the selection of event candidates was based on the kinematic - fit technique .",
    "the details of the kinematic - fit parameterization of the detector information and resolution are given in ref .",
    "events that satisfied the @xmath27 hypothesis with the confidence level ( cl ) greater than 5% were accepted as possible reaction candidates .",
    "the kinematic - fit output was used to reconstruct the kinematics of the outgoing particles .    the analysis technique and the selection criteria used in the present work were very similar to the ones described in detail in refs .",
    "a signal from the @xmath9 decay was searched for as a peak in the invariant - mass spectrum of the @xmath29 final state , @xmath30 , at the mass region of the @xmath6 meson . since the major contribution to the four - photon final state comes from the reaction @xmath31 , it was partially suppressed by eliminating all events for which the cl of satisfying the @xmath32 hypothesis was greater than 0.0001% .",
    "because of this cut , the measurement of the @xmath9 decay is impossible for the region when the two - photon invariant mass is close to the @xmath33 mass .",
    "this cut would also eliminate @xmath34 decays if they exist .",
    "however , the @xmath34 decay is cp - violating and was never observed experimentally .",
    "similar to the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , further suppression of the @xmath35 background was achieved by cuts on the larger value of the two possible invariant masses @xmath36 with respect to @xmath30 .",

    "each of the three cuts on @xmath37 implies discarding all events that lie above the corresponding line .",
    "although the @xmath35 background is comparably smooth in the region of the @xmath6 mass and can not mimic a peak from @xmath9 decays , the additional suppression of this background was important for observing a small @xmath9 signal above statistical fluctuations in the background events .",
    "there are two background sources that can mimic a peak from @xmath9 decays .",
    "these backgrounds are caused by @xmath38 and @xmath39 decays , which have much larger partial decay widths ( @xmath40 and @xmath41  @xcite ) than @xmath9 .",
    "the @xmath38 decay can mimic the @xmath9 signal when the electromagnetic ( e / m ) showers of both outgoing photons split off .",

    "the @xmath44 decay mimics the @xmath9 signal when the e / m showers of some outgoing photons overlap or are not detected .",
    "the case of overlapping e / m showers is more difficult to identify as the total energy of all the photons is conserved . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , the @xmath39 background with overlapping e / m showers can be significantly suppressed by applying a cut on a so - called effective radius of the clusters , which are systematically wider in the case of overlapping showers .",
    "the effective radius @xmath45 of a cluster containing @xmath46 crystals with energy @xmath47 deposited in crystal @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the opening angle ( in degrees ) between the cluster direction and the crystal axis . a density distribution of the cluster effective radii as a function of the cluster energy",

    "[ fig : pi0gg_cuts](c ) and [ fig : pi0gg_cuts](f ) .",
    "each of the cuts discards all events for which at least one of the two @xmath45 values is above the corresponding line .",
    "besides the so - called physical background , there are two more background sources .",
    "the first one comes from interactions of incident photons in the windows of the target cell .",
    "the subtraction of this background from experimental spectra is typically based on the analysis of data samples that were taken with an empty ( no liquid hydrogen ) target . in the present analysis ,",
    "the empty - target background was small and did not feature any visible @xmath6 peak in its @xmath30 spectra .",
    "another background was caused by random coincidences of the tagger counts with the experimental trigger ; its subtraction was carried out using event samples for which all coincidences were random ( see refs .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the selection criteria were optimized using mc simulations of the process @xmath19 and all the background reactions . to reproduce the experimental yield of the @xmath6 mesons as a function of the incident - photon energy ,",
    "the @xmath7 reaction was generated according to its excitation function , measured in the same experiment  @xcite , which was then folded with the bremsstrahlung energy dependence of the incident photons .",
    "since the photon - beam energy range used in the analysis is large ( nearly 700  mev ) , the @xmath7 production angular distribution changes with energy .",
    "however , the production angle was generated isotropically as its experimental distribution , averaged over all energies , was sufficiently close to isotropic .",

    "@xcite .    for all reactions ,",
    "the generated events were propagated through a geant ( version 3.21 ) simulation of the experimental setup . to reproduce resolutions of the experimental data , the geant output ( energy and timing ) was subject to additional smearing , allowing both the simulated and experimental data to be analyzed in the same way .",
    "the simulated events were also tested for whether they passed the trigger requirements . from the analysis of the mc simulation , the average acceptance for the process @xmath19 varied between 7% and 14% , depending on the criteria used for event selection .        to measure the @xmath9 decay rate as a function of the diphoton invariant mass squared ,",
    "the data were divided into eight @xmath2 bins . the bin corresponding to the the @xmath33 mass was not analyzed since it was almost empty due to suppressing @xmath32 events by the 0.0001% cut on the kinematic - fit cl for this reaction .",
