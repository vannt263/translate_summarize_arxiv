    "networks of semiflexible polymers have become one of the focal points in current soft matter research .",
    "the reason for this interest is twofold : on the one hand , most relevant structural biological materials , both intra- and extracellular , share the common architecture of crosslinked semiflexible polymer networks .",
    "two archetypical examples are the cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix . at the same time , there is a wide - spread realization that semiflexible networks represent an interesting soft - matter system in their own right , outside of any biological context , resulting in a much more fundamental interest in the microscopic and geometrical origins of their mechanical behavior .    the mechano - elastic characteristics of networks of semiflexible polymers have been studied to analyze and characterize different types of these networks , both in vivo @xcite , and in vitro  @xcite .",
    "the contributions of theory have been many and insightful , but analytical progress has typically only been possible in certain limiting cases where simplifying assumptions may be believed to hold , most notably the assumption of affine deformations  @xcite . at the same time , computer simulations have been used to study these networks , but they too have had to rely on simplifications - either reducing the system to two dimensions and limiting to the small - strain regime @xcite or ignoring the non - linear nature of the constituent filaments @xcite .",
    "and @xmath1 has length @xmath2 and end - to - end distance @xmath3 .",
    "@xmath4 denotes the angle between two end - to - end vectors of neighboring segments along the same filament . ]",
    "we believe that the time is right for more realistic numerical modeling of these networks that allows for a detailed microscopic look at the relations between structure , geometry and mechanical properties . to this end , we present a computer model to simulate these semiflexible polymer networks in three dimensions .",
    "networks are considered to consist of filaments , described as semiflexible polymers .",
    "these filaments are crosslinked in various locations , which might induce extra bending of filaments , thus increasing the free energy of the system .",
    "we start with a homogeneous , isotropic initial random network with a high free energy , and employ a monte carlo scheme to relax this network .",
    "this approach allows us to generate realistic three - dimensional networks containing hundreds of crosslinks , which are nonetheless well equilibrated and thus represent realistic initial conditions for further mechanical loading in three dimensions .",
    "the methodology to generate such networks is the first main result presented in this paper , and is described in the first part of the paper ( section ii ) .    in the second part of this paper ( section iii )",
    ", we subject these networks to shear , and analyze their behavior as a function of the network parameters , e.g. the stiffness and the length of the filaments .",
    "the results of these computer experiments are compared with experiments to validate our model , and yield novel predictions for the mechanical behavior of semiflexible networks .",
    "we begin our discussion with a detailed look at the generation of our semiflexible networks based on single polymer energies , and how the metropolis - monte carlo scheme is implemented and adapted for our specific purposes .      the networks considered in this manuscript consist of filaments , which are linked by crosslinks @xmath5 . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows a schematic representation of a part of the network , indicating important parameters of the network and the notation used .",
    "each filament is an inextensible semiflexible chain , whose energy in the presence of an external force is given by    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is the arc length coordinate running along the filament , @xmath8 is the bending stiffness which is related to the persistence length @xmath9 as @xmath10 , with @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the ( unit ) tangent vector along the filament , and @xmath13 is the applied force , directed along the end - to - end vector of the polymer .",
    "the filamentous contribution to the total energy of a network is the sum of the energies of all filaments . in this work",
    "we consider inextensible filaments , thus ignoring backbone stretching of the filaments , a deformation that is only relevant at high forces for most biopolymers .    a brief note on our nomenclature : our networks consist of ( multiply ) connected _ filaments_. each of these filaments is partitioned into _ segments _ , which begin and end in _ crosslinks_. a filament can thus consist of many segments , but is always a single mechanical entity , satisfying persistence not just at the segment level but also through crosslinks .",
    "each crosslink connects segments of two filaments , and our networks are therefore strictly tetrafunctional - albeit with the possibility of dangling ends which are discarded ( we do not take steric avoidance into account ) .",
    "compared to the other scales in the network , crosslinks are assumed to be exceedingly small so that their only action , effectively , is to force a binary bond between two distinct filaments , or remote regions of the same filaments .    in our computer simulations , we store a complete list of all positions @xmath14 of the crosslinks , a complete list of the contour lengths @xmath2 of the segments between crosslinks @xmath15 and @xmath1 , and a connectivity table which lists which segments are linked by each of the crosslinks .",
    "we do not keep track of the spatial configuration of a segment between two crosslinks .",
    "instead , we use the exact radial distribution function as computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) @xcite to assign to each segment a contour length drawn from the radial distribution function computed at the segment s end - to - end length and persistence length . in this manner",
    ", we can already perform an important part of the full ensemble sampling in a straightforward manner : different assignments of the contour lengths correspond to different realizations of semiflexible networks with a prescribed spatial distribution of crosslinks .",
    "the relative likelihood of a given distribution of lengths is computed from the free energy of the resultant network , which we compute as follows .    for a given network realization",
    "we partition the free energy in an internal segment part @xmath16 and an inter - segment part @xmath17 . as stated above , the internal degrees of freedom of the segments are integrated out .",
    "thus , we express the free energy of a segment as a function of the distance between the crosslinks ( @xmath3 ) and the length of the segment ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "if the applied force @xmath13 in eq . ( [ eq1 ] ) is positive ( i.e. , stretching the filament ) , @xmath16 can be computed from eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) by employing a semiflexible analogue of the marko - siggia interpolation formula @xcite ; an expression for this is given in the next section .",
    "the semiflexible wlc force - extension formula is not particularly accurate for negative forces , as the filaments quickly assume configurations with considerable transverse displacements under compressive loading .",
    "the crucial feature of compressive loading , however , is that the forces involved are always considerably smaller than those encountered for extensional loads - indeed , this asymmetry in the force - extension curve is responsible for many mechanical features of semiflexible networks . for negative forces , we find that the force - extension is adequately described by an exponential approach to the asymptote set by the classical euler buckling force . integrating the force - extension curve yields the following expression for the energy    @xmath18    where @xmath19 is the scaled extension given by @xmath20 these equations are not only computationally convenient , they also provide an excellent fit to the full , analytical force - extension curves as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2]a , where we plot the force vs. the scaled extension @xmath19 .",
    "in addition to the single - segment force - extension , we also need to keep track of their persistence through crosslinks .",

    ", we use a monte carlo minimization scheme : starting from an isotropic , random network , we propose random changes in topology , each of which is either accepted or rejected according to the metropolis criterion .",
    "the initial network is constructed by placing @xmath60 nodes with random coordinates in a cubic periodic cell . to connect these nodes into a four - fold coordinated network ,",
    "we proceed iteratively : we begin by identifying three nodes which are close to each other and connect these with a loop of three bonds .",
    "this loop is then extended one bond at a time : we identify a node @xmath61 which is not fully connected and which is closest to an existing bond @xmath62 , and then replace this existing bond by two bonds @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "this process is repeated until all nodes are four - fold connected .    in the resulting fully fourfold - coordinated network ,",
    "each bond is considered to be a segment of a single , long filament .",
    "this network as a whole can therefore be considered a single , circular filament which is crosslinked to itself at various places .",
    "we then proceed to minimize the free energy - computed as detailed before - of this initial network , using the standard local minimization method of damped molecular dynamics .",
    "the initial network will be highly stressed , and in general far removed from a realistic equilibrium configuration .",
    "chiefly , this is due to considerable filament bending , with intra - filament bends at crosslinks often exceeding 90 degrees . as initial large strides towards an optimal configuration will proceed along downhill directions related to the release of precisely these dominant bending stresses , we first focus on rearranging the topology of the network , analogous to the continuous random network approach , pioneered by wooten , winer , weaire @xcite and further extended and optimized as detailed in @xcite",
    "this is realized by a series of monte carlo moves that alter the topology ; these are moves ( a ) and ( b ) in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . to the initial configuration with a topology @xmath65 with",
    "minimized coordinates @xmath66 , we assign a free energy @xmath67 as obtained from eq .",
    "( [ eq2c ] ) plus a quadratic function around the average bond distance , to prevent crosslinks from clustering and to tune the final network topology .",
    "the average bond distance determines whether the final network will be densely or loosely crosslinked .",
    "we then change the topology to @xmath68 by one of the moves , and relax the network with this new topology , resulting in the new coordinates @xmath69 and a new free energy @xmath70 .",
    "depending on the change in free energy @xmath71 , the topological change is accepted or rejected , using the metropolis algorithm .",
    "note that in this stage , we assume that the free energy of a network with minimized crosslinks coordinates is representative for the free energy of all networks with the same topology , up to some additive constant that is topology - independent .",
    "once such topology altering moves no longer significantly affect the overall energy - this typically happens in configurations where the bending angle of the filament in each node is on average around 20 degrees - contour lengths are attributed to the segments . as explained , for a segment @xmath63 with end - to - end distance @xmath72 , the length @xmath73 is drawn from the corresponding distribution for the wlc with the desired persistence length @xmath9 .",

    "our computational method allows us to work at both levels by direct and simultaneous measurement of the overall stiffness as well as all individual displacements and forces in the system , to high accuracy .",

    "from experiments @xcite and simulations @xcite it is known that the average filament length influences the network response . in cells many capping proteins are active that can control the length of the filaments , thus changing the mechanical properties .",

    "segments of the same filament influence each others displacements , thus restricting the freedom to adapt to stresses . besides ,",
    "when crosslinks connect two or three segments instead of four , these crosslinks are more flexible to reorient when sheared .",
    "therefore , networks with short filaments are softer during shearing .    fig .",
    "[ fig6]b also shows that the stiffness becomes nearly zero for short filaments , a behavior independent of @xmath9 .",
    "this decrease is related to the percolation of the network .",
    "when the filaments become too short , no real network will be formed . in that case",
    ", shearing will shear the liquid in which the filaments are immersed , but the filaments will not be constrained in their movement and thus the stiffness will vanish . please note that we employ a specific procedure to remove material from the network to generate increasingly sparse networks , which implies that the filament length at which the modulus vanishes can not be directly related to experiments .",
    "the overall trend , however , is representative of real networks .      while the system deforms in our simulations , we allow for non - affine reorientations of the segments .",
    "it has been suggested that such non - affine deformations greatly alter the mechanical response @xcite , and indeed we find that this is true .",
    "first , a few words about the definition and measures of non - affinity . in general , an applied macroscopic strain maps any material point @xmath112 in the reference space in the network onto a new point @xmath113 in the target space .",
    "the location of the point in the target space may be thought of as arising from a combination of an affine deformation and a non - affine contribution :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the deformation gradient tensor , which for the case we consider - three - dimensional simple shear in the @xmath116-direction - is given by @xmath117 the observation that the non - affine contribution @xmath118 depends both on the applied strain and the ( original ) location of the point under consideration immediately raises the question of what , precisely , it means for a system to be affine . in the strictest sense",
    ", an affine system may be defined as one obeying @xmath119 for all @xmath120 .",
    "this definition , however , is highly restrictive as it does not allow for _ any _ non - affine motion at any point . for systems that do behave non - affinely to some extent ,",
    "the most general measure of the extent of this non - affinity was shown in @xcite to be the non - affinity correlation function @xmath121 where the average @xmath122 is over all crosslinking points in the network .",
    "both its spatial dependence and the strain dependence are of interest - in a moment we will investigate the strain dependent aspects by focusing on the trajectory that single points trace out during a deformation .",
    "following @xcite , we shall measure to this end the equal argument limit of the trace of @xmath123 which we shall call simply @xmath124 : @xmath125 note that this measure need not approach zero at large strains , even though one may expect all segments to become aligned with the direction of maximal strain in this limit and experience , in effect , a purely extensional strain .",
    "the reason @xmath124 does not tend to zero lies in the fact that even though the deformation becomes _ differentially _ affine , it does not become affine in the absolute sense . to focus on this differential affinity , which we feel is a more appropriate measure of ( asymptotic ) affinity ,",
    "we introduce a second measure by considering the differential displacement from the initial point @xmath126 to the final point @xmath127 before and after a small strain increment @xmath128 : @xmath129 we use this to define the differential non - affinity measure @xmath130 this measure _ does _ go to zero as @xmath83 becomes very large .",
    "later , our simulations will show that we do not expect this limit to be attained in experiments as , for realistic parameter values , the system will have failed long before .",
    "@xmath131 and @xmath132 may be expressed in terms of each other , and the latter tending to zero implies that asymptotically , @xmath131 should become constant with the magnitude of this constant reflecting the overall strength of the past non - affinity .",
    "ultimately , we are interested to see to what extent non - affinity affects the mechanical response . to monitor this influence ,",
    "we perform a shear without relaxation after each strain increment , thus obtaining @xmath133 .",
    "[ fig7a]a shows both @xmath134 , which is independent of @xmath82 , and @xmath87 for networks with different filament length , all having @xmath94 .",
    "as can be seen , even for long filaments , the difference between affine deformation and non - affine deformation is striking , both for he initial modulus @xmath110 and for the onset of stiffening .",
    "this puts the so - called linear ( _ i.e. _ , small - strain ) regime of network elasticity in a new perspective : even though the strains are small , there is always a finite amount of non - affinity which greatly affects the overall small strain response .",
    "it is thus crucial to understand the role of non - affinity , even at small strains , to predict the network modulus .",

    ", the network shows a strong non - affine reorientation . as indicated before",
    ", we expect that for high shear all filaments will be aligned in the direction of shear and deform purely by stretching .",
    "since stretching is an affine deformation , we expect @xmath132 to ultimately tend to zero at large strain .",
    "this figure and the inset make it clear that this asymptotically ( differentially ) affine regime is never actually attained , and non - affinity will continue to feature prominently all the way up to the point of failure .    shorter filaments , or filaments that are less densely crosslinked , are less constrained in their motions which should , in principle , allow for greater non - affine motions . to verify whether indeed this is the case , we evaluate the non - affinity as a function of filament length . to better compare to existing experiments",
    ", we shall use @xmath131 , the overall non - affinity parameter , instead of the differential measure @xmath132 .",
    "[ fig7b]a indeed shows a pronounced increase in non - affinity as the length decreases .",
    "this is in agreement with experiments on f - actin , which also show an increase in @xmath163 for decreasing filament length @xcite .",
    "translating @xmath163 to real distances gives for actin with an average @xmath164 values between @xmath165 , which is close to the values between @xmath166 reported for experiments @xcite .",
    "besides the length dependence , we also observe a dependency of @xmath9 on the non - affinity : networks of stiffer filaments behave more non - affinely .",
    "this suggests that asymptotically , we recover the classical picture of rubber elasticity ( which does very well for long , flexible polymers but rather poorly for semiflexible systems ) : as the persistence length decreases , the polymer configurations become increasingly random ( i.e. , gaussian ) which is accompanied by a decrease in the non - affinity .",
    "this is precisely the rubber limit : gaussian polymers deforming affinely .",
    "note that these non - affine deformations are the sole possible origin of the large difference in stiffness between affine and non - affine deformations shown above .",
    "thus , even though the magnitude of the non - affine deformations is small , they do have an important effect on the network response .",
    "this is a striking example of the value of simulations in this field : microscopic structure and motion are of crucial importance to properly understand the macroscopic behavior .",
    "apparently , the macroscopic result of the microscopic non - affinity is to lower the overall stiffness of the system .",
    "this suggests an interesting question : if the filaments do not go to their affine positions , where _ do _ they go ? to begin to answer this , we consider the orientational order of our networks and compute the nematic order parameter @xmath142 , defined as @xmath167 . here",
    "the average is taken over all vectors connecting crosslinks that are connected by segments of filaments and @xmath27 is the angle between such a vector and the average orientation .",
    "an isotropic network has @xmath168 , while a fully ordered network has @xmath169 .",
    "even when we shear a network affinely , the order will increase from zero to one . to appreciate the effect non - affinity",
    "has , we should therefore compare to the affine ordering .",
    "this affine ordering is represented by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig7b]b .",
    "the dotted lines show the effect of non - affine reorientations on the ordering of the network , for different filament lengths .",
    "interestingly , non - affine reorientations tend to increase the order in the network , a behavior independent of @xmath9 .",
    "to get insight in the direction of the ordering , we plot the distribution of the angle @xmath47 of the end - to - end vectors of segments with respect to the @xmath146-axis at @xmath147 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7b]c . by comparing the distribution in a non - affine network deformation ( straight bars ) with the distribution of an affine network deformation ( dotted bars ) we see that the non - affinity increases the number of segments oriented at a small angle . to appreciate the differences in the two distributions , we plot the analytic expression for the distribution of an initial isotropic medium that is sheared affinely .",
    "interestingly , the maximum of @xmath170 coincides with the maximal extensional strain experienced as a function of angle .",
    "as the figure clearly shows , the additional ordering is in the direction of maximal extensional strain .",
    "this might seem counterintuitive - the order appears to be increasing in the direction of increasing filament extensional strain , which would be highly unfavorable from an energetic point of view .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that non - affine motions are not purely rotational : they may encompass additional and simultaneous overall shifts and extensional / compressional components .",
    "it would be most interesting to see if this increased order is also observed in experiments .",
    "our simulations suggest that systems containing long filaments are the best place to look for this effect , even though these tend to display lower overall non - affinity .",
    "so far , we have considered only the non - affine motion of single points .",
    "the non - affinity correlation function is not only a function of strain , it may also be evaluated for spatially separated points @xmath171 and @xmath172 . to this end",
    ", we consider @xmath173 , where @xmath174 is the actual vector between two crosslinks and @xmath175 is the vector between the crosslinks if they would have moved affine during @xmath176 .",
    "the average , now , runs over all pairs of crosslinks whose separation is @xmath177 .    as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , there are two limiting cases in the behavior of @xmath178 . if filaments would be stiff rods , the only way to adapt to strain would be by rotating the whole filament . in that case",
    ", doubling @xmath177 would double @xmath179 and thus @xmath180 . in the other limiting case , segments along a filament",
    "behave totally uncorrelated , leading to @xmath181 .",
    "the latter is also the limit for @xmath182 .",
    "however , the net effect of correlated motion of segments along a filament will be highly sensitive to the actual network configuration .",
    "[ fig8]a shows @xmath178 of a network at different strains .",
    "note that the larger scatter for small values of @xmath177 is due to the smaller number of pairs of crosslinks . as can be seen",
    ", @xmath178 varies with strain : low strains give a low initial value of @xmath178 and a steep increase while high strains show just the opposite .",
    "this behavior is strongly correlated to the stiffening behavior shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5]a ( upper line ) .",
    "the observed strain - dependence of @xmath178 is indiscernible when normalizing with respect to @xmath83 rather than of @xmath183 , which might explain why experiments report no strain - dependence @xcite .",
    "we observe a small but systematic dependence on @xmath9 , as shown in fig .",
    "interestingly , thus far we hardly observe any length dependence of the correlation in non - affine behavior , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8]c for networks with @xmath89 . for filaments with @xmath184",
    ", one would naively expect that the behavior of segments along a filament will be much more correlated than the behavior of segments belonging to different filaments .",
    "thus , one might expect to find increasing spatial correlations for systems composed of larger filaments . that we do not see this behavior suggests that it is approximately balanced by another effect : larger filaments have more links to the rest of the system and are therefore more constrained .",
    "while the individual segments along a single filament would like to line up , they become increasingly unable to do so .",
    "interestingly , the first experiments to measure @xmath178 do show a length dependence @xcite .",

    "the thickness of the segment indicates the size of its displacement .",

    "[ fig5]a reveals some outliers in the @xmath87 vs. @xmath83 curve .",
    "these discontinuities in @xmath87 are accompanied by an increase in @xmath61 .",
    "this is not a glitch , but rather reflects an interesting microscopic aspect of our networks . to understand this behavior we look at the displacements of individual segments during shearing .",
    "[ fig9 ] shows a network in which the thickness of the segments indicates their displacement during a strain increment of @xmath188 .",
    "here we see what happens : during such a strain increment , a significant fraction of the segments has a relatively large incremental displacement in comparison with the average displacement of segments during shear increments .",
    "the noteworthy feature is not so much that there are large displacements , but rather that these displacements are localized and occur in correlated fashion .",
    "this is reminiscent of the behavior of so - called collectively rearranging regions , observed in simulation and experiment in glassy systems and colloidal suspensions .",
    "these events are rare over the time courses that we have simulated , but may turn out to play an important role in the long - time behavior of these materials",
    ". it would be most interesting to check whether these events are also seen in experiments - while these may not be able to resolve the blip in @xmath87 they might be able to register the accompanying peaks in @xmath61 .",
    "the weight in determining @xmath61 of a reorientation of a certain size decreases with increasing @xmath83 , since @xmath61 measures the total non - affinity relative to the total shear .",
    "this implies that for small shears , reorientations might induce huge peaks in @xmath61 , while these peaks are absent for larger shears even though the reorientations are still present .",
    "we have presented a new method to generate and deform 3d networks of biopolymer filaments . by an adequate choice of energies",
    "both the entropic stiffness of individual segments as well as the persistence of filaments through crosslinks can be taken into account . by a monte carlo thermalization the networks",
    "find a local minimum , without further interference from our side .",
    "this method enables us to relate the macroscopic network response to microscopic behavior of individual segments and crosslinks , both at small and large strains .",
    "although a quantitative comparison between experiments and our simulations is hard to obtain , the first results from these simulations agree well with experiments .",
    "both the stiffening during shearing and the length - dependency of the non - affinity are as expected and fit well into the general framework of the behavior of semiflexible polymers .",
    "besides , the stress - dependence of the stiffness for large shears is the same as experiments have shown .",
    "this confirms that our model captures the right features that decide the network behavior .",
    "our model proves an excellent tool to compare affine deformations with deformations that allow for non - affine displacements .",
    "we have shown that non - affine displacements have a large influence on the stiffness of a network and the onset of stiffening .",
    "this accounts for the important role of filament length .",
    "besides , the accuracy of analysis of the behavior of the filaments during deformation reveals some surprising results that are hard to obtain by experimental analysis .",
    "thus far unobserved , the non - affinity increases the order in the networks .",
    "thus far we have only considered networks of a single type of filaments .",
    "both in cells and in the extracellular matrix , the important load - bearing biopolymer networks are made up of different kinds of filaments : vessel walls are composed of collagen and elastin , and the cytoskeleton too is a composite system containing f - actin , intermediate filaments and microtubules .",
    "this method is a promising tool to explore the behavior of such composite networks under strain , and we are currently exploring their properties .",
