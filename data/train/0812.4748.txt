    "if we want to determine precisely the dynamical behavior of a macroscopic system out of equilibrium , we need in general to deal with highly coupled equations of motion related to the full microscopic degrees of freedom of the system .",
    "however , when we are interested in knowing only the dynamics of macroscopic observables , we can sometimes expect a large amount of reduction of degrees of freedom relevant to the dynamics of these macroscopic observables .",
    "they should be described by a closed set of simpler coarse - grained equations .",
    "such a situation happens when the space - time scales for our macroscopic observables are clearly separated from those of the microscopic ones .",
    "the hydrodynamics is such an example .",
    "hydrodynamics is derived by assuming the local thermal equilibrium : at any point of a fluid , there exists a _ finite _",
    "domain ( fluid cell ) in which the fluid can be regarded as homogeneous and in thermal equilibrium , so that the usual thermodynamic relations hold for this piece of fluid .",
    "the physical properties of the fluid are determined by these thermodynamic relations .",
    "furthermore , although finite , the size of the domain is considered to be negligible compared to the typical scale of the system , so that the thermodynamic variables can be considered as continuously varying functions of position and time .",
    "on the other hand , strictly speaking , the theromodynamic description of a matter is only possible when the time scale in question is much larger than the relaxation time of the matter needed to attain thermodynamic equilibrium . in other words , for hydrodynamic description",
    ", the fluid cell should have the minimum scale to realize local thermal equilibrium .",
    "for example , for a gas , such a domain should at least be several times larger than the mean - free path of the gas particles , otherwise fluctuations are too large and the thermodynamic description of the gas property will fail .",
    "it is thus reasonable to consider that hydrodynamic approach is not applicable when the size of the system is relatively small so that the typical space - time inhomogeneity scales are comparable or smaller than those required for the local thermalization of the system .",
    "in fact , it is believed that the deviations from the usual thermodynamics is an important factor in physics associated with molecular scales such as biological systems small .",
    "a parameter commonly used to evaluate quantitatively the applicability of hydrodynamic approach is the knudsen number @xmath0 , defined as the ratio , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mesoscopic scale of the microscopic structure ( in the case of a gas , it is the mean - free path of the gas particles ) and @xmath3 is the typical hydrodynamical inhomogeneity scale . if @xmath4 everywhere , a hydrodynamic description will be applicable as the dynamics of the system .",
    "this also means that the time scale of the macroscopic ( hydrodynamic ) scales are much larger than the thermodynamic relaxation time . * *  * * in general , the hydrodynamic time scale is of the order of @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the velocity of the sound of the fluid .",
    "on the other hand , there are several counter examples where hydrodynamic models seem to work for @xmath0 values apparently not so small .",
    "one of these is the physics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions @xcite . to analyse the behaviors of huge amount of produced particles in the relativistic heavy - ion collisions",
    ", we simply assume that the many - body dynamics can be approximately given by relativistic hydrodynamics ( in particular , perfect fluid ) .",
    "since the typical dimension of the whole system is initially from few@xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) ( or even less if we consider the lorentz contraction due to the relativistic effects ) and expands violently . for a hydrodynamic description to be valid from the beginning of this expansion , we expect that the fluid cell size should at least be less than one order of magnitude of @xmath9 .",
    "that is , we should use the cell size of the order of @xmath10 , which is already comparable , if not smaller , to a typical value of mean - free path of the constituent particles , partons .",
    "the value , @xmath10 is even closer to the scale of quantum correlation length . in spite of these facts , the collective motion of the matter produced in the relativistic heavy ion collision",
    "is well described by the hydrodynamic model .",
    "the hydrodynamic model is a very important tool to understand the experimental data .",
    "then how should we understand such a situation ? here , we have to recall that the local thermodynamic equilibrium is a _ sufficient condition _ for the thermodynamic relations to be valid , but not _ a necessary condition_. for example , let us consider an ideal boltzmann gas . if the system is isotropic in momentum space at any position , the energy density and pressure are given as@xmath11and@xmath12where @xmath13 is the one - particle phase space distribution function and @xmath14 . if these particles are massless ( or ultra - relativistic ) , then @xmath15 so that we always have]@xmath16independent of the form of the distribution function @xmath17 . )",
    "is valid if the four - energy momentum tensor is traceless ( conformal theory ) and isotropic in the landau local rest frame . for a hydrodynamic description ,",
    "we only need the thermodynamic relations ( equation of state ) as eq.([e=3p ] ) . ]    as we saw above , what we need to arrive eq.([e=3p ] ) is only the condition of _ _  local isotropization _ _ of the particles in the momentum space , and not the _ _  thermal equilibrium__. it may well be possible that the process of local isotropization in momentum space can be attained much faster than the complete thermalization .",
    "in fact , for a quark - gluon plasma which is now believed to be produced by relativistic heavy - ion collisions , such a dynamical mechanism has been studied in analogy with the plasma instabilities @xcite .",
    "this is an example where the thermodynamic relations become valid very quickly even the system is not in a real thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is also shown that the nonequilibrium dynamics of quantum scalar field exhibits such a prethermalization behavior @xcite .",
    "these considerations indicate that there are situations where hydrodynamical description can still be valid even for a system where the usual criteria in terms of knudsen number is apparently violated . from now on , we refer such a state of matter to prethermalized  state , for which functional relations among macroscopic observables ( such as equation of state ) emerge , although the true thermalization is not yet attained .",
    "now , two basic questions arise here .",
    "one is in which situations such a prethermalized state occur , and the second , whether the thermodynamics properties ( equation of sates ) of the matter stay the same as those of the real thermal equilibrium , or not .",
    "either prethermalization or real thermalization , the emergence of functional relations among macroscopic observables indicates the reduction of the other microscopic degrees of freedom irrelevant to the description of the physical properties of the matter",
    ". this must be due to a kind of randomization processes of these irrelevant degrees of freedom ( irrelevant variables ) where the information of the initial condition is lost by random interactions among them .",
    "the difference between the real thermalization and pre - thermalization is that , in the case of pre - thermalization , there still exist some degrees of freedom which still depends on the initial condition .",
    "if such a prethermalization scenario happens , we can expect some universal behavior such as the boltzmann - gibbs statistics which leads to the thermodynamic relations . as a matter of fact ,",
    "the boltzmann - gibbs statistics is not a unique possibility to be consistent with thermodynamics . in 1988 , tsallis proposed a new statistical mechanics where entropy is non - additive @xcite .",
    "so far , extensive studies have been developed and the applications of tsallis entropy extend to biological systems , high - energy physics , and cosmology .",
    "because of the non - additivity of the entropy , tsallis statistics is considered to be important for describing correlated systems . from our prethermalization scenario ,",
    "the tsallis statistics may be attained before the real thermalization is achieved and the later relaxation process after the tsallis statistics may be described by the time evolution of @xmath18 , which is the parameter of tsallis statistics , and the tsallis statistics is reduced to the boltzmann - gibbs statistics for @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "to make the idea clear on the effect of correlation on the relaxation time of a prethermalization mechanism , let us consider a problem of finding a minimum of a function of two variables , as shown in fig .",
    "when the function has a narrow long valley , starting from some arbitrary initial point , the usual steepest descent method always first goes to the closest point of the valley instead of going directly to the real minimum , as indicated by the dashed curve .",
    "the narrow valley means that there exists a strong correlation between the two variables .",
    "in other words , if there exist any strong correlations among variables , the minimizing path always tries to satisfy the correlation first ( fast relaxation stage ) , then follows downstream to the true minimum along the valley generated by the correlation ( slow relaxation stage ) .",
    "the above consideration suggests that a prethermal state may correspond to a kind of narrow valley of the free energy generated by dynamical correlations .",
    "if such a local minimum stays for a very long time , we may consider the system as in a kind of equilibrium , but the microscopic occupation probability is not that of the boltzmann - gibbs statistics , due to the constraint created by the correlation .",
    "then what characterizes such a local equilibrium ?",
    "we show that there exists a class of dynamical correlation for which the minimisation of the energy under the constraints lead exactly to the general form of tsallis statistics . in this image ,",
    "the dynamics of the slow relaxation stage may be described by the evolution of @xmath20 to arrive at the real thermal equilibrium described by the boltzmann - gibbs statistics corresponds to @xmath19 .",
    "note that in the above analogy , the correlation is rather static one .",
    "however the dynamical constraints are not necessarily determined only from the hamiltonian itself , but may depend on the state of the system in a dynamical way .",
    "in other words , for a given system , depending on the initial condition , the correlation and hence the constraints among microscopic degrees of freedom may change . in this sense , it is possible that the value of @xmath18 is not a quantity determined from the beginning even when the system is specified .",
    "of course , prethermalization involves a broad range of phenomena , and has been studied for a long time in several works @xcite . in particular , the relaxation to a quasi - stationary state under long - range interactions is strongly suggested in the hamiltonian mean field model @xcite .",
    "here we develop a general phenomenological argument of how the states described by the tsallis nonextensive statistics can be regarded as a prethermalized states .",
    "in this section , we show that the tsallis distribution function can be obtained when there exists a class of correlations among particles in each single particle energy levels .",
    "let us consider a system composed of @xmath21 particles where the single - particle energy spectrum and the corresponding occupation numbers are given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "suppose there exists a strong @xmath18-body correlation among @xmath24 particles in any single - particle state @xmath25 .",
    "in general , @xmath18 is a function of @xmath25 .",
    "however , we assume , for simplicity , the number of correlated particles are independent of state @xmath25 . due to this correlation among particles , the rules to determine the occupation numbers",
    "@xmath26 affects the statistics as described below . for a given value of @xmath18 , the number of possible ways of forming correlated @xmath18-body clusters in each @xmath25 state is given by @xmath27 for @xmath28 . here , we used stirling s formula for the asymptotic values of @xmath29-function . note that @xmath18 is the average number of particles to form a cluster and does not have to be integer .",
    "we call these correlated subsystems @xmath18-clusters .",
    "if the @xmath18-clusters are formed with equal a priori probability , the number of such clusters @xmath30 should be proportional to the number of ways of forming them . thus@xmath31 and",
    "the total number of the @xmath18-clusters in the whole system is then @xmath32    we may estimate the energy associated with the cluster formation .",
    "since a @xmath18-cluster in the energy level @xmath25 carries the single particle energy , @xmath33 we have @xmath34 note that , for @xmath35 the expression above formally leads to the total energy of the system , except for a constant factor this fact will be useful for the recovering the usual boltzmann - gibbs distribution .",
    "see the later discussion .",
    "it is natural to think that , once the number of the correlated particles are fixed by @xmath18 , the most probable configuration will be realized by minimizing the correlation energy , that is , the energy associated with these clusters , *  * @xmath36 with@xmath37 where the variation should be taken with the occupation numbers , @xmath38 this is equivalent to the variational problem of the following quantity , @xmath39 with the following constraints , @xmath40 that is , we consider the following variational problem , @xmath41 = 0 , \\label{variation}\\ ] ] for all @xmath24 s. we get@xmath42 if we introduce the occupation probability@xmath43 then the above solution can be expressed as @xmath44 ^{\\frac{1}{q-1 } } ,   \\label{min}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 .",
    "calling @xmath46 this distribution can equivalently parametrised in terms of @xmath18-exponential function as,@xmath47 this form of parametrisation is convenient since it reduces to the the boltzmann - gibbs distribution function in the limit of @xmath48 .",
    "however , it should be stressed that the thermodynamic properties of the prethermal state proposed here are different from that of the boltzmann - gibbs statistics . in usual derivation of the boltzmann distribution",
    ", we have to maximise the total number of microstates accessible for a given total energy and number of particles . the variation principle eq.([variation ] ) in its form does not lead to the boltzmann - gibbs variational equation for maximising the entropy of the system , since for @xmath49 the second term and the third term degenerates if @xmath50 and @xmath51 are finite constant , independent of @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , we may re - arrange these lagrange multipliers @xmath50 and @xmath51  in terms of new constants , @xmath52 and @xmath53 as @xmath54 = 0 ,   \\label{variation2}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 and we have used@xmath56 the second term @xmath57 where @xmath58 and in the limit of @xmath35 we have@xmath59 thus , for @xmath35 the variational principle , eq.([variation2 ] ) leads to@xmath60 = 0 ,   \\label{variationboltzmann}\\ ] ] which is exactly the same equation we get in the boltzmann - gibbs statistics when we maximise the entropy@xmath61 with@xmath62 after using stirling s formula .    all the discussion above can be done in terms of occupation probability , @xmath63 from the beginning .",
    "the variational problem , eq.([deltaeq ] ) together with the constraints , eqs.([n ] ) and ( [ nq ] ) is equivalent to@xmath64 with@xmath65 and@xmath66 where the variation is now taken with respect to @xmath67 the corresponding equation to eq.([variation2 ] ) is @xmath68 where the second term is nothing but tsallis entropy @xmath69 thus , we have shown formally that our system is a physical realization of tsallis formulation of the generalised statistics .    here",
    ", there are important remarks .",
    "although we have shown that the energy minimum principle of correlated clusters lead to the same results as tsallis generalised statistics , the physical significance of our example is very different from that of tsallis approach . in our approach , we imposed the condition to minimise the energy of systems of @xmath18-clusters , keeping the total number of clusters .",
    "this energy is not the total energy of the system , but that of a subsystem of the system which are strongly correlated .",
    "when we neglect the interaction energies , the total energy of the system is the sum of single particle energies so that @xmath70 in this case , if we require conservation of the total energy of the system , we have to add the constraint , @xmath71 in addition to eqs.([n]),([nq ] ) . by introducing a new lagrange multipliers , we obtain instead of eq.([eqn : dener ] ) , @xmath72where now @xmath73 and @xmath74 should be determined from the constraints , eqs.([n]),([nq ] ) and ( [ etot ] ) . as expected , the energy spectrum has the maximum cut - off energy , @xmath75 which is a natural consequence of the conservation of energy . for @xmath76 the above expression reduces to eq.([q - spectrum ] ) as expected .",
    "in general , the number of the @xmath18-clusters and the coefficient of the probability of the cluster formation will depend on @xmath25 . in this case , we may write the number of clusters as @xmath77 the variational problem is then @xmath78 = 0.\\ ] ] then the distribution function is @xmath79",
    "to check our prethermalization scenario , let us consider a very simple toy model described below .    1 .",
    "initially @xmath21 particles are distributed as @xmath80 over equally spaced energy levels .",
    "let us denote the energy of the @xmath81th particle as @xmath82 2 .",
    "choose randomly a pair of particles , say , @xmath83 and @xmath84 3 .",
    "energies of @xmath83 and @xmath85 are updated according to one of the following alternatives : 1 .",
    "the new energies are set to the lower one of @xmath86 and @xmath87 that is,@xmath88 then choose another @xmath89-th @xmath90 particle randomly and attribute @xmath91 to conserve the total energy .",
    "2 .   change the energies as @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the level spacing . here , if one of @xmath94 becomes negative , then this step is skipped .",
    "that is , we have to keep always @xmath95 .",
    "the alternatives ( @xmath96 ) and ( @xmath97 ) are chosen randomly , but the ratio of the average frequency of ( @xmath96 ) to ( @xmath97 ) is kept as a constant , @xmath98 .    here",
    ", the collision of type ( @xmath96 ) is the process of the formation of a kind of clusters , while the collision of type ( @xmath97 ) is the energy exchange process and may destroy the formed clusters .",
    "it is well - known that for @xmath99 ( no type ( a ) collision ) in the above model , the final single - particle spectrum will become the boltzmann distribution . by the competition of the two collision processes",
    ", we expect the number of correlated particles will reach some stationary value , and , by construction , the energy of a correlated pair always tends to diminish . in this way",
    ", we may expect that the above system will lead to the situation described by eq .",
    "( [ min ] ) . in fig .  2",
    ", we show the results of simulations , for several values of @xmath98 from @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "it is interesting to note that @xmath102 leads to a non - boltzmann distribution which is well approximated by the tsallis distribution , @xmath103 ^{1/(1-q)}$ ] , where @xmath104 and @xmath105 are determined from the normalization condition and conservation of energy .",
    "one parameter fits with respect to @xmath18 were performed and the results are indicated by the continuous curves in this figure . for @xmath106 , the spectrum converges to the boltzmann distribution @xmath107 as expected .",
    "note that for a one dimensional case like the present model , the tsallis distribution is valid only for @xmath108 , otherwise the energy expectation value diverges . for larger values of @xmath98 ,",
    "the fitted value of @xmath18 tends to this limiting value , but the distribution begins to deviate substantially from the tsallis distribution in the low energy region .    .",
    "the probability of cluster - forming collisions ranges from @xmath109 ( top ) to @xmath110 ( bottom ) .",
    "tsallis distributions fitted to the calculated spectra are also shown , together with the corresponding @xmath18-values . ]",
    "it is important to note that these distributions are the stationary and stable ones .",
    "we confirm that starting from any different initial conditions , the final distribution converges uniquely for a given @xmath98 parameter .",
    "furthermore , the cluster formation through type ( a ) collisions accelerate the speed of the convergence .",
    "for example , for @xmath111 the distribution converges 10 times faster than @xmath99 case .    in the above toy model ,",
    "the time reversal is violated for the collision type ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "however , this is not the crucial factor to obtain the non - boltzmann distribution .",
    "we have checked this in a more elaborate model which has time - reversal invariance .",
    "as an another simple example in which a single particle spectrum deviates from a simple exponential form , let us consider @xmath21 identical harmonic oscillators @xmath112 , described by the following hamiltonian,@xmath113here@xmath114and @xmath115 is an @xmath116 symmetric matrix , representing the linear interactions among these @xmath21 harmonic oscillators .",

    "the reason why the inclusive spectrum deviates from the boltzmann to tsallis ( @xmath165 ) distribution is not obvious .",
    "however , we may note several key aspects indicating this result .",
    "first , the semi - diagonal nature of the matrix @xmath115 means that there are more correlations among oscillators @xmath131 than they are uniformly coupled among them .",
    "second , the individual spectra for different oscillators fluctuate much more compared to the case of uniformly interacting case ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "third , the effective temperature @xmath166 is smaller than the boltzmann case .",
    "the last , but not least , important point is that the inclusive spectrum we are looking in this coupled harmonic oscillators does not account for the interaction energy . that is",
    ", the sum of single particle energies defined in eq.([singlee ] ) does not give the total energy of the system .",
    "the cross terms as @xmath167 for @xmath168 are not counted .",
    "these terms are omitted in the definition of single particle energies , expecting that these are irrelevant  information and cancels out for the behavior of single particle energy in average . however ,",
    "these effects become relevant in the presence of correlations .",
    "of course , there are many cases where the inclusive spectrum is neither boltzmann nor tsallis . for example , if we generate @xmath169 as homogeneous random numbers between @xmath170 $ ] ( that is , all @xmath171 ) or between @xmath172 $ ] ( all @xmath173 ) , the inclusive spectrum are completely different .",
    "it is then interesting to study the variation of the inclusive spectrum with respect to the form of the coupling matrix @xmath122 however , it is not a trivial task to choose the coupling matrix @xmath115 in an arbitrary manner , since we have to have all the eigenvalues real and positive to guarantee the stability of the system . from this reason",
    ", we may generate the interaction matrix starting from its eigenvalues .",

    "[ fig7 ] , we show the sequence of inclusive spectra when the eigenvalues are very inhomogeneous . in this example , we took eigenvalues as a quickly increasing function of its index , @xmath178a similar behavior of the inclusive spectrum appears when we take @xmath179where @xmath180 is a constant .",
    "we found that all of these spectra are very well fitted by the two parameter tsallis distribution , @xmath181 .",
    "the negative curvature spectra also appear , but they can also be fitted by @xmath182 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that other simple 2-parameter function , such as exponential of polynomial in @xmath183@xmath184does not work at all .",
    "another important fact is that , as we mentioned in the introduction , the correlation among the internal degrees of freedom may depend on the initial condition so that the value of @xmath18 can also depend on the initial condition .",
    "in fact , the form of inclusive spectrum when we change the initial condition changes but still can be expressed by @xmath185 with different @xmath18 and @xmath166 .",
    "therefore , the parameter @xmath18 is rather a kind of state parameter like other thermodynamic quantities and not the parameter specified by the hamiltonian of the system .",
    "in this paper , we discussed the concept of the prethermalized state as the presence of strong correlation in the phase space of the system .",
    "we argued that those states described by tsallis statistics belong to this category .",
    "we show that a very specific class of correlation leads naturally to the tsallis distribution for the occupation probability in energy levels .",
    "we also show an interesting simple example where tsallis distribution emerges .",
    "we studied the inclusive energy spectrum of @xmath21 coupled harmonic oscillators .",
    "depending on the coupling , the inclusive spectrum exhibit clearly the tsallis distribution .",
    "the discussion here have been restricted in the framework of classical mechanics . however , the mathematical structure of general coupling matrix is equivalent to a quantum mechanical problem to find the eigen frequencies if the vector @xmath131 is considered as a state vector in an appropriate base .",
    "the single particle spectra are thus somewhat related to the reduced density matrix defined for each individual oscillators . in this sense",
    ", the question treated here can also be related to the problem of decoherence and locality .",
    "the emergence of tsallis distribution is not deterministic , but probabilistic in the sense that it depends on the choice of the random unitary transformation .",
    "there are specific cases that the inclusive spectrum does not behave neither boltzmann nor tsallis , at all .",
    "however , when we choose the unitary transformation randomly , then the probability of emerging boltzmann , or tsallis type distribution seems to be dominant .",
    "for example , if we go from a system where the coupling strength is small and the interaction matrix is uniformly random to the system where there exist stronger interactions or correlations , the inclusive spectrum starts to deviate from the boltzmann to tsallis , statistically .",
    "this observation deserves a further systematic investigation",
    ". it will be interesting if we can formulate the problem from the point of variational problem as discussed in this paper .",
