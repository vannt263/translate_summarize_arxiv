    "besides its immense technological importance , the theoretical description of externally driven non - equilibrium quantum systems is a challenge itself .",
    "we study a photonic silicon - on - insulator hollow core waveguide ( soi ) in contact with gold nano - grains exposed to an external field .",
    "the external time - periodic field modifies the electronic band structure within the nano - grains by generating photo - induced floquet - bands which can be attributed to the franz - keldysh effect @xcite .",
    "all metals exhibit intraband transitions occurring within the conduction band featuring a more or less small absorption rate , whereas the governing processes are the interband transitions . in gold ( au )",
    "a significantly different behaviour has been found and attributed to the specific electronic structure of closed packed au , namely to the high polarizability of the @xmath0 cores @xcite .",
    "the collective resonance exhibits a large red shift to approximately @xmath1 which leads to the fact that the corresponding intensity is governed by the interband but its sheer existence results from the occurrence of intraband transitions which can be recognised as step like structures in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "these transitions , which result from a non fermi alike distribution of states , have been observed in pump probe experiments with au nano - spheres of diameters below @xmath2 .",
    "their occurrence has been interpreted as the border from bulk like characteristics to the quantum regime of nano - particles .",
    "we show that the pump laser modifies the single plasmon band which results in the development of floquet - bands .",
    "both frequency and amplitude of the external field allow easy and fast - switching control over the position in energy of these bands and sensitively control the generation of a fano - resonance with the photonic soi mode .",
    "we show that this switching may significantly alter the transmission properties within the soi by the formation of polaritons , electron photon bound states , at the surface of the nano - grains .",
    "consequentially , the potential of this quantum - optical functional element for all optical switching based on polaritonics is proven .",
    "our setup ( fig . [ fig_00 ] ) is described by a frhlich hamiltonian for fermion - boson interaction which has to be solved by applying the keldysh formalism with respect to the non - equilibrium character of the considered processes on the femto - second time scale .",
    "we consider the soi in contact with nano - grains , the nano - grain in the external field and finally discuss the non - equilibrium solution of the complete system in terms of electron keldysh - green s function and soi transmission . as our starting point",

    "the electrons may couple with strength @xmath8 weakly to soi photons with frequency @xmath9 .",
    "hence the full hamiltonian reads @xmath10    for a clear description we treat first the setup without the external laser field , than the interaction of laser and band electrons , and finally the full compound of external laser radiation interacting with band electrons and the coupling of the latter by a fano resonance with the waveguide mode .",
    "the hamiltonian without the external laser field reads , @xmath11 here , we assume the spatial extension of the au nano - grains to be small ( @xmath12 ) compared to the wavelength of the photonic mode inside the soi .",
    "therefore , the momentum of the photons is much less than the electron s momentum and we can set @xmath13 whenever we consider the electronic subsystem .",
