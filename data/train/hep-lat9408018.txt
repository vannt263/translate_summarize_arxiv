    "qed@xmath6 , the theory of electrons and photons in 2d , for massless electrons is analytically solvable @xcite and has been studied extensively @xcite . in the original version",
    "the system has @xmath7 fermions .",
    "the fermions are confined and the model is equivalent to a system of non - interacting bosons .",
    "the theory is superrenormalizable and there is only finite renormalization of the charge .",
    "chiral symmetry is broken due to an anomaly in the axial current thus there is no goldstone boson , but a massive pseudoscalar of gaussian nature .",
    "one has charge shielding , i.e. there are no long - range forces between static charges . allowing for @xmath8 fermions , one does have additional massless states @xcite , a situation prototyped in the @xmath9 non - linear @xmath10-model .",
    "many of these properties are intriguingly similar to those of qcd in 4d , which in the non - perturbative domain is studied mainly in the lattice regularization by computer simulations .",
    "the schwinger model formulated on a lattice is therefore a challenging 2d model for lattice qcd@xmath11 . in this formulation",
    "it naturally encompasses the massless and the massive situation . in the continuum",
    "the massive schwinger model can not be solved explicitly although there are results perturbative in @xmath12 @xcite . from these",
    "we expect a situation similar to the massless case with further bound states and quark trapping , again very much like in qcd@xmath11 .",
    "lattice formulations of fermions are plagued with the doubling problem .",
    "there are more than one pole in the brillouin zone of the momentum space propagator . in the staggered ( kogut - susskind ) formulation one",
    "distributes different components of the spinor on different sites of a hypercube and thereby effectively reduces the @xmath13 multiplicity by a factor @xmath14}$ ] . in the wilson formulation",
    "the doubler modes are given masses of @xmath15 and one expects decoupling in the continuum limit @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore most lattice calculations rely on the hybrid monte carlo method to implement the fermions . in this process , however , another doubling of fermion modes is introduced in order to deal with the positive definite square of the determinant instead of the determinant itself .",
    "the only known way to avoid this doubling is to include the determinant in the observables and not use it as a probability weight .",
    "thus , in the standard lattice formulation one deals with an @xmath8 schwinger model .",
    "recently some exact results became available for the continuum massless @xmath8 schwinger model @xcite , thus the situation in respect to the flavour problem of lattice versions has somewhat improved .",
    "the naive and the staggered formulation has a simple phase diagram in the @xmath17-plane , where @xmath18 is the gauge coupling and @xmath19 denotes the bare fermion mass parameter .",
    "the continuum limit is recovered approaching the point @xmath20 along trajectories with @xmath21 , where the proportionality constant characterizes the physical mass of the bound state boson . in that limit the known condensate value @xmath22",
    "should be obtained .",
    "most of the lattice calculations worked in that formulation and reproduced the expected continuum results of the massless schwinger model successfully ( see e.g. @xcite , for recent work on the non - compact formulation cf .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "little is known for the wilson formulation , though . here",
    "the two bare coupling parameters are the gauge coupling and the hopping parameter @xmath3 related to the bare fermion mass .",
    "chiral symmetry is explicitly violated for finite @xmath23 and most likely restored in spontaneously broken form in the continuum limit .",
    "this deprives us of a suitable order parameter .",
    "also , for the @xmath7 model , there is no massless goldstone boson .",
    "a continuum limit should be obtained in the approach to @xmath5 along trajectories following fixed values of physical ( dimensionless ) quantities . in @xmath24",
    "there is a line @xmath25 where the pion mass vanishes , corresponding to the situation of a vanishing bare fermion mass ( due to the wilson term the bare quark mass is renormalized additively ) . in the schwinger model",
    "we may expect a similar behaviour and in this case the massless continuum schwinger model is obtained following such a curve @xmath26 .    despite good knowledge of the properties of the theory in the continuum ,",
    "it is still a challenge to clarify the @xmath7 model phase diagram on the lattice in the wilson formulation .",
    "one can not use @xmath27 as an order parameter nor can we determine the mass of the boson state in a direct simulation .",
    "in this paper we therefore try to contribute to this issue in an analytic ( at @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) study and a computer calculation ( at @xmath30 and 5 ) of the partition function itself .",
    "with help of the equivalence of the strong coupling model to the 7-vertex model @xcite we construct the hopping expansion up to @xmath1 . at",
    "non - zero @xmath23 we directly determine the fermion determinant in the numeric integration over the gauge field background .",
    "the scaling of the lee - yang zeroes indicates that , somewhat contrary to an earlier finding @xcite , there is indeed a phase transition line for all positive values of the gauge coupling @xmath23 .",
    "a subset of the numeric results has been presented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the action for the massive lattice schwinger model in the wilson representation is given by @xmath31_{x , x^\\prime}\\psi ( x^\\prime )   \\ ; .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the gauge fields @xmath32 is the standard wilson action with the lattice gauge coupling @xmath23 and @xmath33 denotes the dirac operator on the lattice @xmath34 .",
    "eq.s ( [ action ] ) and ( [ fermaction ] ) are formal expressions in the partition function of the model , which , after grassmann ` integration ' , is given by @xmath35 @xmath36 is the partition function of the purely bosonic system and @xmath37 the expectation value of some operator for that system . without loss of generality",
    "we normalize @xmath38 .",
    "the partition function @xmath39 is a polynomial of degree @xmath40 in @xmath3 and thus an entire function .",
    "all coefficients of that polynomial are positive . we know that @xmath41 is strictly positive for @xmath42 ; above this value of @xmath3 we checked explicitly that individual configurations do produce negative values although the partition function remains positive for finite lattices .",
    "the zeroes of that polynomial , called lee - yang zeroes @xcite , have a non vanishing imaginary part for all finite @xmath43 . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "these zeroes pinch the real axis of the complex @xmath3 plane and define thereby the point of non - analyticity at @xmath44 .",
    "how the zeroes approach the real axis is governed by finite size scaling , at a critical point related to the critical exponents of the system @xcite .    from ( [ partitionfcn2 ] )",
    "we see that the partition function of the full model is proportional to the purely bosonic expectation value of the determinant of the lattice dirac operator .",
    "since @xmath45 we find that @xmath46 is zero only where @xmath47 .",
    "whereas mass gap calculations can not be performed for one flavour , this operator can be calculated and this calculation can be extended to any number of flavours .    for given @xmath23",
    "we have to determine the expectation value for the determinant for complex @xmath48 .",
    "only at @xmath28 and @xmath49 this may be done analytically .",
    "elsewhere one may rely on the following numerical methods .",
    "analytic continuation : : :    one obtains values of @xmath50 for various real @xmath3 .    performing a polynomial fit and using this fit one analytically    continues to complex @xmath51 . in a test for the    controllable situation of free fermions",
    "we find unstable results ; even    the closest zeroes could not be identified reliably .",
    "a better    alternative is to obtain the coefficients of the polynomial expressed    in terms of moments by direct numerical simulation .",
    "this approach has    been successfully used in a recent study in 4d @xcite .",
    "the crucial    point is the convergence of the coefficients with @xmath52 .",
    "this approach is closest related to the quite successful method of    analytic extrapolation and determination of zeroes via histograms    @xcite .",
    "direct evaluation : : :    one integrates over the gauge fields with the usual monte carlo    simulation and produces gauge configurations with the standard bosonic    measure @xmath53 . for each    configuration",
    "one determines @xmath54 for a    sufficiently dense set of complex @xmath3 in the    expected region of the closest zero . the gauge field average    eventually produces the required results .",
    "this method is applicable    for small lattices only , since one has to determine the determinant    for each gauge field configuration explicitly .",
    "on the other hand it    does not involve any extrapolation and works for arbitrary number of    flavours .",
    "for small lattice size ( e.g. @xmath55 ) one may analytically solve @xmath56 and integrate over the gauge fields explicitly to obtain @xmath57 as a polynomial in @xmath3 .",
    "although done with symbolic programs this becomes prohibitive for larger lattices .",
    "another method is based on a map of the massive lattice schwinger model ( at @xmath28 ) on the eight - vertex model @xcite . integrating over the gauge fields",
    "first one finds a theory of non - intersecting loops represented by a vertex model , @xmath58 where @xmath59 denotes the coupling for vertex type @xmath60 and @xmath61 the multiplicity .",
    "the schwinger model corresponds to @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 . in particular the",
    "vertextype 2 corresponding to the intersection of loops is forbidden .",
    "we then produce all possible configurations summing up the corresponding weights .",
    "a configuration may be represented by a legal set of vertices or , equivalently , by a collection of non - intersecting closed loops ( out of connected links ) . for the determination of the series we simultaneously use the link- and the vertex representation . for lattices of size",
    "@xmath67 ( periodic b.c . ) the number of a priori possible link configurations is @xmath68 .",
    "the transfer matrix approach is by far the most economic approach . for a lattice of size @xmath67",
    "we consider the transfer matrix for a column of @xmath69 vertices , @xmath70 where @xmath71 denote the link configurations of the left and righthand set of @xmath69 links each , e.g. @xmath72 ; @xmath73 and @xmath74 may assume @xmath75 values each .",
    "the internal variables have been integrated and periodic b.c .",
    "conditions in the vertical direction have been implemented .",
    "each entry in @xmath76 is given by a polynomial term @xmath77 if it has @xmath78 vertices of type 1 .",
    "one has the symmetries @xmath79 @xmath80 , with the notation @xmath81 , reversal of the direction .",
    "furthermore only entries with even number of occupied external links ( corresponding to values of @xmath73 and @xmath74 ) and allowed vertex configurations are non - vanishing .",
    "this effectively reduces the number of relevant entries by a factor of roughly 8 . in the computer implementation",
    "only relevant entries of @xmath76 are kept . for @xmath82 , @xmath76 has only 8384 independent non - zero entries , each a polynomial in @xmath83",
    ". from @xmath76 one constructs @xmath84 and so on . then @xmath85    alternatively , we also considered blocks of @xmath86 , which may be described by functions , @xmath87 , with four arguments denoting the link configurations of the four edges .",
    "again one has various rotational and reflection symmetries reducing the number of independent non - zero entries of @xmath88 , which are constructed explicitly at the begin . from @xmath87 one",
    "may construct the series for e.g. @xmath89 and @xmath0 lattices by suitable summations , like @xmath90 this method is less efficient than the one - column transfer matrix approach , which we finally used to construct the series .    in the 7-vertex model the partition function",
    "is given as a series in the variable @xmath83 , @xmath91 .",
    "in the 2d schwinger model one uses the hopping parameter @xmath3 and in table [ seriescoeffs ] we give the coefficients of the series in this variable , @xmath92 for various lattice sizes .",
    "the coefficients @xmath93 are integers and are related to the coefficient of the series in @xmath83 through @xmath94 .",
    "1a give the positions of the zeroes in the first quadrant of @xmath95 for lattice size @xmath0 .",
    "for @xmath96 gauge systems with torus geometry the choice between periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions ( b.c . ) for the lattice dirac operator @xmath97 is irrelevant for all beta .",
    "assume a field configuration in fixed gauge , then antiperiodic b.c .",
    "amount only to multiplying the gauge fields at the boundary with a factor of @xmath98 .",
    "this new configuration is within the sum over all gauge field configurations with the same weight as the original one .",
    "thus it is a symmetry of the gauge field integral .    at @xmath49 , if we fix the gauge , the choice of b.c .",
    "may be parametrized by two @xmath96 group elements @xmath99 , e.g. for antiperiodic b.c .",
    "thus , as is done usually in analytic calculations , we may discuss the system of _ free _ fermions with antiperiodic b.c .",
    "as one particular configuration of the @xmath49 limit . in this case the fermionic action can be diagonalized and the determinant evaluated by fourier transformation . within the limitations of available workstations",
    "this may be done with symbolic computer programs up to lattice sizes @xmath101 and larger . however , the results for the complex positions of zeroes are quite different for periodic and antiperiodic b.c .",
    "although the scaling behaviour agrees . due to the dependence on the b.c",
    "we can not compare the zeroes directly with our results at finite @xmath23 .",
    "unlike @xmath102 in the free case the zeroes occur degenerate with multiplicity 4 and 8 ; fig . 1b shows the zeroes ( in the first quadrant of @xmath95 ) at @xmath49 for lattice size @xmath0 . for both , at @xmath28 and @xmath49 , we find a distribution of zeroes , that does not follow a simple geometric shape .",
    "the general shape of the distribution at @xmath49 becomes clearer at larger lattices , as shown in fig .",
    "1c for lattice size @xmath103 .",
    "for @xmath104 we use numeric techniques to obtain information on the closest zero on lattice of size @xmath55 , @xmath86 , and @xmath0 , following the second method discussed at the end of sec.2 .",
    "we simulated background gauge field configurations for @xmath105 , and also for @xmath106 , in order to check the reliability of the approach . for each configuration",
    "we evaluated the determinant on a grid of @xmath107 complex @xmath3 values in the presumed region of the closest zeroes .",
    "the final expectation values on this grid are then analyzed with help of interpolation . for lattice",
    "@xmath55 size we summed over 10000 gauge field configurations , for @xmath86 and @xmath108 over 5000 .",
    "the analytic results at @xmath28 are in excellent agreement with the numeric results for lattice sizes @xmath55 and @xmath86 . at the largest lattice size , however , the exact position is off from the numerically determined position by 2 standard deviations ( the jackknife statistical error ) .",
    "actually , @xmath28 is the worst case in the gauge field integration , since the configurations are completely random .",
    "we have to conclude that for the largest lattice size the number of gauge configurations considered is too small .",
    "( a test at @xmath28 with a statistics of 32000 did not sufficiently improve the situation . ) for this reason for lattice size @xmath0 we doubled the statistical errors obtained at @xmath28 to define the errorbars for the other @xmath23-values and consider these values with some caution .",
    "2 summarizes our results for the size- and @xmath23-dependence of the zeroes closest to the real @xmath3-axis .",
    "the imaginary parts show the tendency to vanish for @xmath109 indicating the existence of a phase transition for all @xmath23 along a curve @xmath25 . for free fermions , where @xmath110 , one finds @xmath111 dependence . for @xmath102 , for the lattices",
    "considered , the behaviour indicates an even faster approach towards zero , like the @xmath112 expected at first order transitions ( where the susceptibility @xmath113 ) .",
    "however , the errorbars and smallness of the lattices do not justify stronger statements .",
    "also , considering the non - uniform behaviour of the real parts shows that we are not yet in the asymptotic regime .    as mentioned , we know of no suitable order parameter to identify existence and type of the possible phase transition line .",
    "earlier investigations of the behaviour of the strongly coupled massive lattice schwinger model based on the 7-vertex model @xcite rather suggested that there is no second critical point at @xmath106 for @xmath114 . to clarify this inconsistency we repeated that 7-vertex calculation with significantly increased statistics ( up to a factor of ten ) and denser grid in the coupling .",
    "it turned out that with this improvement one does indeed find indications of scaling in the susceptibility for lattices larger then @xmath115 .",
    "there is still a controversy concerning the peak position and the boundary conditions of the 7-vertex model to be settled .    in summary , the @xmath7 massive ( and massless )",
    "schwinger model on the lattice and with wilson fermions is still a formidable task .",
    "direct simulation of the model and determination of the bosonic mass seem to be impossible with present day resources . from the equivalence to the 8-vertex model we know that there is an isolated critical point at @xmath106 and @xmath116 @xcite ; this is most likely not the endpoint of the singular line discussed above .",
    "the expansion in @xmath3 around @xmath117 is convergent only for @xmath118@xcite .",
    "the responsible singularity could lie at any complex @xmath3 with @xmath119 and therefore @xmath120 does not necessarily define a critical point .",
    "the model is believed to have a line of phase transitions at @xmath121 beginning at @xmath122 which is a point with a second order transition and running to some @xmath123 . except for @xmath124 , the free model , there is no proof that this statement is correct .",
    "our findings from the direct evaluation of the partition function and the finite size dependence of the lee - yang zeroes support the scenario of a phase transition line from @xmath125 up to @xmath126 .",
    "the phase diagram may look similar to the @xmath8 situation , also for qcd@xmath11 .",
