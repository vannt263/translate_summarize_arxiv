    "the purpose of this paper is to study the hopf bifurcation of pathogen - immune dynamics in the steady states of the mathematical model with delay kernel .",
    "dynamical systems with delay kernel have been studied for population dynamics and neural networks [ 2 ] .",
    "we introduce a model which describes one of most known infectious diseases , namely malaria infection .",
    "our model is based on the model from [ 6 ] .",
    "the model , as it was created , without delay , has the feature that the interior equilibrium is always asymptotically stable if it exists . for obtaining the natural behavior which was observed experimentally , i.e. oscillatory behavior , it is needed to make some adjustments to the model .",
    "one way is to introduce some extra terms into the equations for a better description of the interaction pathogens - immune system or other way is to introduce the delay .",
    "our contribution to the model lies in introduction of the delay kernel , which is a natural thing to do , because it is obvious for everyone that biological processes do not take place instantaneous .",
    "system ( 1 ) without the last term in the third equation , which implies the effect of absorption of the pathogens into uninfected cells , could be used for describing another well - known infectious disease , the hiv infection , as was done in [ 3,7,10 ] or other infectious diseases as hepatitis b virus infection [ 9 ] or hepatitis c virus infection [ 7 ] . because our model deals with malaria infection in what follows we will say some words about this disease . malaria ranks high on the list of world health problems by causing massive human and economic loss .",
    "the parasite in this disease is called plasmodium falciparum and has a high virulence which can cause even death .",
    "malaria has some important features that should be mentioned : first , the amount of variation in disease severity observed in the field is remarkably high , second , the immunity is virtually never sufficient to prevent infection and third , transmission intensity in the field is highly variable both temporally and geographically [ 4 ] .",
    "more precisely , consider the following system :    @xmath2    where @xmath3 , @xmath4 are positives constants and the delay kernel , @xmath5 is assumed to satisfy the following properties : @xmath6    it is also assumed that the system ( 1 ) is supplemented with initial conditions of the form : @xmath7 , \\\\ & \\varphi_{1}\\quad\\mbox{is bounded and continuous on $ [ 0,\\infty)$}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    the model contains three variables : the density of uninfected cells x , the density of infected cells y and the density of pathogens in blood z. uninfected cells are recruited at a constant rate @xmath8 from the source within the body , such as the bone marrow and have the natural life expectancy of @xmath9 days .",
    "cells are infected by contact with pathogens and turn to infected cells at rate @xmath10 .",
    "infected cells die at rate @xmath11 . the death of the cells results in the release of @xmath12 pathogens per an infected cell and these pathogens have a life expectancy of @xmath13 . for @xmath14",
    "we obtain the model of hiv infection with delay kernel and for @xmath15 we obtain the model of malaria infection with delay kernel .    in system",
    "( 1 ) , if the delay kernel has the form @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a parameter which denotes the effect of the past memories , then system ( 1 ) becomes :    @xmath18 \\end{split}\\ ] ]    for @xmath19 the system has been studied in [ 6 ] .",
    "+ in system ( 1 ) , if the kernel @xmath0 has the form @xmath20called weak kernel , where q is a parameter varying in @xmath21 which denotes the decay rate of the effect of the post memories , then system ( 1 ) becomes :    @xmath22    in system ( 1 ) , if the kernel @xmath0 has the form @xmath23then system ( 1 ) becomes :    @xmath24    this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , the local stability property and hopf bifurcation of models ( 3 ) , ( 4 ) , ( 5 ) are discussed and some sufficient conditions for stability are derived . in section 3 , model ( 1 ) containing the general kernel is further studied and both the direction and the stability of hopf bifurcation are analyzed by the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem and some criteria for stability are derived .",
    "then , we consider two cases : in the first case @xmath0 is delta function and in the second @xmath25 .",
    "numerical simulations will be shown , in order to justify the theoretical results .",
    "finally , conclusions are drawn with further research directions given in section 5 .",
    "in this section , consider the local stability of the equilibrium solution of system ( 1 ) .",
    "from the special nature of the delay kernel ( 2 ) embedded in system ( 1 ) , we found out that an equilibrium solution @xmath26 of ( 1 ) is given by the solution of the system :    @xmath27    from ( 6 ) it results that if @xmath28 , @xmath29 , then system ( 6 ) has two equilibria .",
    "the first one is @xmath30 and it represents the state in which the pathogens are absent .",
    "the second is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 the equilibrium @xmath33 lies in the interior of the first quadrant .",
    "then we say that @xmath33 is an interior equilibrium and represents the state in which the pathogens are present .",
    "+ in what follows , the equilibrium @xmath26 is transformed to the origin , so the system ( 1 ) becomes :    @xmath34    where    @xmath35    and @xmath36 rewrite system ( 7 ) in the following matrix form : @xmath37where @xmath38    @xmath39    the associated characteristic equation of the linearized system is given by : @xmath40where    @xmath41    if @xmath42 , then    * the characteristic equation ( 9 ) is given by @xmath43 * for @xmath19 the characteristic equation ( 10 ) is given by @xmath44where @xmath45 * if @xmath19 , the equilibrium @xmath33 is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath46 * for @xmath47 , given by @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the positive root of the equation @xmath50 with @xmath51 there is a hopf bifurcation .    if @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , then    * the characteristic equation ( 9 ) is given by : @xmath55 * the equilibrium @xmath33 is asymptotically stable if and only if @xmath56 * if there exists @xmath57 so that @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then a hopf bifurcation occurs at @xmath33 as @xmath60 passes through @xmath61 .",
    "in this section , the stability of the bifurcating periodic solutions of system ( 1 ) with the kernel satisfying ( 2 ) is studied . for convenience ,",
    "in the study of the hopf bifurcation problem , first we transform system ( 7 ) into an operator equation of the form @xmath62where @xmath63 and operators @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined as    @xmath66    @xmath67    where @xmath68 with @xmath69 defined in ( 8) . + as in [ 1 ] , [ 5 ] , the bifurcating periodic solutions @xmath70 of ( 1 ) are indexed by a small parameter @xmath71 .",
