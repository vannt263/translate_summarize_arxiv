    "the ever increasing amount of galaxies probed by imaging surveys such as the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ? * ) , the great observatories origins deep survey ( goods , * ? ? ? * ) , or the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ultra deep field ( udf , * ? ? ? * ) triggered the need for automated galaxy classification methods .",
    "ideally , these should not only be faster in classifying thousands of galaxies than any visual examination , but should be more robust and less subjective than the latter .",
    "an important aspect is the evolution of galaxy structure over cosmic time : deep hst surveys such as goods or udf reveal a huge amount of peculiar or irregular galaxies ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that do not fit into the standard hubble scheme , nor into the class of irregular galaxies as defined for the local universe .",
    "this is owed to the fact that more distant galaxies are seen in a significantly younger stage , in which starburst events and mergers occur at a larger rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". moreover , at higher redshifts , bluer rest - frame wavelengths are probed , giving emphasis to the distribution of the young stellar component .",
    "although trust in visual classification remains for both low - redshift ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and high - redshift datasets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the hope was that new structural classification schemes would also be suitable to describe the various kinds of peculiar galaxies in an appropriate way @xcite , and to separate them from the more familiar galaxy classes .",
    "`` non - parametric '' structural measures that have been developed in this context are the concentration index ( @xmath0 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the asymmetry index ( @xmath1 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the clumpiness index ( @xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "these three are known as the cas parameters @xcite .",
    "two further parameters that are frequently used are the gini coefficient @xcite and the @xmath3 parameter @xcite .",
    "gini describes the distribution of flux values among the pixels of an object s image , while @xmath3 quantifies the distribution of the brightest 20% of pixels . as opposed to the cas parameters , neither gini nor @xmath3 require the center of a galaxy to be defined , and",
    "thus do not need to assume that a well - defined visible center exists at all .",
    "all these parameters are commonly dubbed `` non - parametric '' , since they do not rely on certain model parameter fits , such as the srsic index @xcite in models of radial surface brightness profiles .",
    "a more appropriate term might therefore be `` model - independent '' .",
    "one particular application of these model - independent measures was the identification of galaxy mergers .",
    "studying their abundance and properties is crucial to understand the origin of the most massive galaxies in the universe today ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , of which many must have formed within the last gigayears @xcite . @xcite selected major galaxy mergers as objects with a rest - frame @xmath4-band asymmetry index of @xmath5 , and used it to derive merger fractions and subsequently galaxy merger rates out to a redshift of @xmath6 . by applying this structural selection to submillimeter - detected galaxies ,",
    "@xcite concluded that many of these are undergoing a major merger .",
    "@xcite studied the fraction of major mergers and minor merger candidates among high - redshift star - forming galaxies , using a classification based on gini , @xmath3 , and concentration .",
    "a major merger selection criterion within the two - dimensional parameter space of gini ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath3 was established by @xcite as @xmath8 , enabling them to study the evolution of the galaxy merger rate .",
    "the gini coefficient was found to correlate strongly with stellar mass @xcite .",
    "in fact , @xcite claim that gini traces better the overall structure of a galaxy than any other morphological parameter of their study .",
    "apart from describing the overall structure , the gini coefficient was also used to identify substructure in galaxies : @xcite presented a preliminary method to automatically identify large bars , using the radial variation of gini within a galaxy .",
    "the gini coefficient therefore plays an important role in present - day attempts to understand the formation and evolution of galaxy structure , and in particular , to unveil the formation process of massive galaxies . despite simulations and a direct comparison of goods and udf images @xcite , which were done in order to quantify how gini and other parameters depend on the signal - to - noise ratio and angular size resolution , the stability of the gini coefficient has not been fully examined yet . in what follows ,",
    "i present a critical assessment of the stability of gini with respect to the signal - to - noise ratio and the choice of aperture .",
    "the hst udf @xcite and goods @xcite acs imaging data are ideally suited to investigate the dependence of the gini coefficient on the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath9 ) , and hence the depth , of an image .",
    "these two datasets were observed with the same instrumental setup , used very similar data reduction procedures , and differ only in their total exposure time . moreover , along with the udf images , astrometrically registered images of the corresponding goods area are provided , which can be ideally used for a direct investigation of the effect of image depth on the analysis of galaxy structure .",
    "the measurements described below were performed on the @xmath10 images . as initial galaxy sample ,",
    "i use the @xmath10 udf source catalog @xcite .",
    "sources that had been identified manually ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were excluded , since these are not included in the available segmentation maps , which denote the spatial extent of each object .",
    "sources with stellarity@xmath11 were excluded , following @xcite , leaving 8276 objects .",
    "both goods and udf suffer from residual ( i.e.  non - zero ) background flux , which typically reaches a level of 1/5 of the noise rms in goods and 1/20 in udf , in the @xmath10 band .",
    "this background , along with a value of the noise rms , was determined individually for each galaxy as a single value that corresponds to the median pixel value within a @xmath12-box , applying five iterations of clipping outliers at 2.3 standard deviations .",
    "all galaxies were masked in this process .",
    "for each galaxy , i determined a `` petrosian semimajor axis '' ( hereafter petrosian sma , @xmath13 ) , i.e. , in the calculation of the petrosian radius @xcite , i use ellipses instead of circles ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the elliptical shape and source center of each object were adopted from the udf source catalog , and kept fixed during the process .",
    "the petrosian sma was defined as the semimajor axis @xmath14 at which the local intensity falls below one fifth of the average intensity within @xmath14 .",
    "the local intensity is measured as the average intensity within an elliptical annulus reaching from @xmath15 to @xmath16 , applying five iterations of clipping outlying pixel values at 2.3 standard deviations , and masking neighbouring objects . for 181 objects ,",
    "the petrosian sma determination did not converge or yielded a too large value based on visual inspection .",
    "these were excluded , as well as 92 further objects that comprised less than 28 pixels each ( corresponding to a circle with a radius of 3 pixels ) .",
    "the final working sample thus contains 8003 galaxies .",
    "the total flux of each galaxy was measured within @xmath17 . for each galaxy",
    ", the petrosian radius was calculated on the udf image only , and was then used on both the udf and the goods image .",
    "the gini coefficient was calculated following the definition of @xcite , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the number of pixels in the image , @xmath20 is the pixel flux , and @xmath21 . as discussed by @xcite ,",
    "the absolute values of @xmath20 are required in order to preserve the correct structure at low flux levels , where noise can result in negative values of @xmath20 after background subtraction . for this calculation ,",
    "all pixels within a given aperture were used .",
    "gini was measured for the udf and goods images on three different elliptical apertures : @xmath22 ( `` 2/3-petrosian aperture '' ) , @xmath23 ( `` petrosian aperture '' ) , and @xmath24 ( `` 1.5-petrosian aperture '' ) .",
    "the strong dependence of the gini coefficient on the aperture within which it is measured is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : aperture ] . for each of the three apertures , gini occupies a completely different range of values for galaxies with a reasonably high @xmath9 .",
    "the importance of this aperture dependence becomes clear when considering the fact that different authors keep using different apertures in their computation of model - independent morphology measurements : while , for example , @xcite and @xcite use 1.5 circular petrosian radii , @xcite use 1.0 petrosian sma .    moreover , the figure implies a @xmath9-dependence of the gini coefficient : from the high-@xmath9 values , a transition is observed towards a common gini value of 0.42 for all apertures at very low @xmath9 , where noise dominates over the actual signal .",
    "however , from fig .  [",
    "fig : aperture ] alone it is not possible to judge whether this transition is a direct dependence on @xmath9 , or whether it simply means that the gini coefficient takes a different value for galaxies of different surface brightness , which could be useful to distinguish between different galaxy classes .",
    "consequently , a direct examination of the effects of image depth is necessary .",
    "it is made possible through a comparison of the very same galaxies and apertures in the udf and goods images , which differ only by the total exposure time .",
    "this comparison is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] for the three different apertures .",
    "the arrow in each panel indicates the difference in depth between udf and goods ( 1.95 mag ) , calculated from the median of the individual noise rms measurements . for a given galaxy ,",
    "the gini values of udf and goods lie on a horizontal line in each panel , since the galaxy s @xmath9 value in udf ( left ordinate ) was used for plotting , whereas the right ordinate has simply been scaled according to the depth difference to represent the goods @xmath9 values .",
    "obviously , the depth difference equals the offset of the gini distributions for the two images . for the example of the 1.5-petrosian aperture ( top panel in fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] ) , this means that the transition of gini values from @xmath25 to @xmath26 is determined solely by the @xmath9 , and not by different surface brightnesses of galaxies  the latter do not change between udf and goods .",
    "similar structures , though not as clearly defined , can be seen for the petrosian and the 2/3-petrosian aperture ( middle and bottom panel ) .",
    "gini thus shows a strong dependence on the @xmath9 of an image .    in order to have a more quantitative measure of the systematic @xmath9 effect on the gini coefficient , fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] shows the difference between the goods and the udf gini value for each galaxy , versus the @xmath9 .",
    "the same comparison was presented by @xcite for their sample and aperture . from this , they decided to restrict their analysis to galaxies with @xmath9 per pixel of @xmath27 in goods , corresponding to @xmath28 .",
    "this is in agreement with the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] , which illustrates that the difference between the goods and the udf values for the petrosian aperture is very small at this @xmath9 level .",
    "the gini distributions of different galaxy classes in goods and udf are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : class ] , again for the three elliptical apertures .",
    "galaxy classification was done visually for all 1019 objects with @xmath29 pixels and @xmath30 mag , hereafter referred to as the good quality subsample . in udf within the petrosian aperture . for a given galaxy",
    ", the @xmath9 per pixel is defined as the average flux per pixel , divided by the noise rms value calculated in a box centered on the galaxy s position . ] since many , if not most galaxies in deep surveys such as udf are not well represented by any class of the hubble scheme , a number of additional classes can be defined that are a more `` honest '' representation of the diversity of galaxies at higher redshifts , such as chain galaxies , clump clusters ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and compact or high - surface brightness irregular galaxies .",
    "while this detailed classification will be used for future projects , the intention here is to get an idea of how the standard galaxy classes distribute ( see the discussion ) , along with the combined class of candidates for ongoing and recent mergers .",
    "therefore , only these are shown in the figure , with their median value and the corresponding interval that reaches from the 5th to the 95th percentile .",
    "it can be seen that e / s0 galaxies and possible mergers , which typically have comparably high surface brightnesses , have similar gini values . recall that gini is not sensitive to the actual location of galaxy pixels ; thus , any asymmetry or irregularity in the spatial distribution does not enter the gini calculation .",
    "early - type spirals have a lower value at least for the 2/3-petrosian and the petrosian aperture , and late - type spirals have again somewhat lower values .",
    "the irregulars have a significantly lower @xmath9 on average , causing their comparison with the other classes to be affected strongly by @xmath9 effects : their gini values are larger than those of the spirals for the 2/3-petrosian aperture ( bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : class ] ) , about equal for the petrosian aperture ( middle ) , and significantly lower for the 1.5-petrosian aperture ( top ) . as an aside ,",
    "note the large overlap of all galaxy types for all apertures  while it might be possible to perform `` non - parametric '' quantitative galaxy classification in a statistical way , it is barely possible to obtain _ clean _ samples of each galaxy class .",
    "determining the frequency of major galaxy mergers at different epochs is a crucial step towards understanding the origin of present - day massive galaxies . in this context , @xcite identified mergers within the parameter space of the gini coefficient @xmath7 and @xmath3 ( which measures the distribution of the brightest 20% of a galaxy s pixels , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) by selecting galaxies with @xmath31 . however , @xcite noted that , when applying this criterion from the submitted version of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* arxiv : astro - ph/0602088v1 ) . ] to their galaxy sample , the majority of selected objects actually appear to be normal galaxies according to their cas ( concentration , asymmetry , clumpiness ) classification criteria . they concluded that the gini/@xmath3 criterion might not be selecting true mergers , or might be more sensitive to specific merger phases .    from the analysis presented here ,",
    "it is immediately clear that this apparent discrepancy is caused by the strong dependence of gini on the chosen aperture : while @xcite used 1.0 petrosian sma , @xcite chose 1.5 petrosian radii for their aperture . since the average gini value increases significantly with increasing aperture ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture ] ) , @xcite s application of the gini/@xmath3 criterion selected many more objects as `` mergers '' than it would have with @xcite s aperture . with aperture size could happen to be such that it counterbalances that of gini .",
    "however , this is not the case : the variation of @xmath3 with aperture size is found to be significantly smaller than what would be necessary for the merger criterion to remain valid on average ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "] furthermore , while @xcite used elliptical apertures in order to avoid the inclusion of many noise - dominated pixels @xcite , @xcite used circular apertures , thereby again increasing the average gini values of their galaxies .",
    "@xcite quote an average gini value of 0.71 for their udf galaxy sample , measured in the @xmath32 band . in the present study ,",
    "the average value for the circular aperture of the same size , but measured in @xmath10 , is 0.64 , using only the good quality subsample .",
    "the corresponding values for the elliptical apertures are 0.38 for the 2/3-petrosian aperture , 0.52 for the petrosian aperture , and 0.62 for the 1.5-petrosian aperture .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio of a galaxy is intrinsically tied to its surface brightness . nevertheless , as emphasized in sect .",
    "[ sec : gini ] , the systematic change of the gini coefficient from high to low @xmath9 values when considering the 1.5-petrosian aperture is a true @xmath9-effect ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] ) and is not caused by varying surface brightness .",
    "this , in turn , means that each @xmath9 level defines its own specific range of possible gini values that galaxies at this @xmath9 level can take .",
    "therefore , a galaxy could only be properly compared to other galaxies if those are at about the same @xmath9 level  a rather alarming result . however , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : depth ] , this effect is far less strong for the 2/3-petrosian and the petrosian aperture .",
    "for these apertures , the range of gini values covered by different galaxies is much larger with respect to the systematic @xmath9-effect  although the latter is still clearly recognizable through the difference in depth between udf and goods",
    ".    the maximum systematic deviation of the gini value that one finds acceptable can of course be subjective .",
    "since the gini coefficient is intended to be used to measure galaxy morphology , a useful criterion would seem that the separation between different galaxy classes be larger than the systematic @xmath9 effect .",
    "an acceptable limit for the systematic @xmath9 effect can , for example , be defined as half the difference between the median gini values of e / s0s and late - type spirals in udf ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : class ] ) .",
    "this would be 0.035 for the 2/3-petrosian aperture , 0.03 for the petrosian aperture , and 0.015 for the 1.5-petrosian aperture .",
    "the corresponding @xmath9-restrictions from fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] would then be @xmath33 for the 2/3-petrosian aperture , @xmath34 for the petrosian aperture , and @xmath35 for the 1.5-petrosian aperture .",
    "when taking into account the effects of drizzling on the noise in goods @xcite , these limits would decrease by 0.2 .",
    "note that the @xmath9 values are calculated as the average @xmath9 of all pixels within a given aperture  it is therefore easier to obtain a larger @xmath9 value for smaller apertures , which contain fewer faint pixels .",
    "the clear conclusion is that for the vast majority of galaxies , the gini coefficient is strongly affected by the @xmath9 when using the 1.5-petrosian aperture : for the goods images , only 2% of the galaxies in the good quality subsample meet the above criterion . for the 2/3-petrosian and the petrosian aperture ,",
    "this fraction is significantly larger , namely 24% and 30% , respectively .",
    "it is therefore recommended to use the petrosian aperture for calculating the gini coefficient , confirming the approach of @xcite .      with the criteria established above , it is possible to assess whether past studies that used the gini coefficient for galaxy classification might have been significantly affected by its systematic behaviour with @xmath9 . as mentioned already in sect .",
    "[ sec : gini ] , in their studies of intermediate and high redshift galaxy morphology and merger fractions , @xcite selected objects having @xmath36 within the petrosian aperture values in goods for the effects of drizzling , thereby lowering the @xmath9 values and making their selection even more restrictive .",
    "] , for which there is almost no difference between the gini values in goods and udf ( fig .",
    "[ fig : difference ] , middle panel ) .",
    "the same selection was adopted by @xcite in their study of agn host galaxy morphologies .",
    "the study of @xcite of galaxy structures and merger fractions in udf used galaxies with @xmath37 mag , and adopted a circular aperture of 1.5 petrosian radii , as mentioned previously . when requiring that the above criterion of @xmath35 for the 1.5-petrosian aperture in @xmath10 be met by more than 50% of the galaxies with magnitudes similar to the limiting magnitude",
    ", the latter would have to be approximately @xmath38 mag ( and leave only very few galaxies in a so selected sample ) . depending on galaxy type and color ,",
    "the limiting magnitude in @xmath32 would differ by several tenths of a magnitude , but still be more than two magnitudes brighter than the selection of @xcite .",
    "consequently , the gini values that @xcite obtained for the majority of their sample must be regarded as being strongly affected by @xmath9 effects .",
    "if they had chosen the petrosian aperture instead , the above criterion of @xmath34 would have been met by about 80% of galaxies with magnitudes around @xmath39 .",
    "furthermore , it needs to be pointed out again that their application of the merger selection criterion of @xcite  which had been established for the elliptical petrosian aperture  is heavily biased by the strong aperture dependence of the gini coefficient ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : gini ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : aperture ] ) , thus providing a straightforward explanation for the apparently very different sensitivity of the cas merger selection and the gini/@xmath3 merger selection ( cf .",
    "the gini coefficient was used by @xcite in their analysis of intermediate - mass galaxies at redshift @xmath40 .",
    "these authors find good agreement of visual morphological classification with the dynamical states of the galaxies , but point out that this correlation is not as clear when using automated classification methods instead . with the petrosian aperture and a limiting magnitude of @xmath41 mag for goods images , they are only weakly affected by @xmath9 effects : about 20% of galaxies with magnitudes around @xmath41 mag fall below the @xmath9 criterion .",
    "the @xmath9 effect on the gini coefficient can cause low-@xmath9 objects to be assigned to later galaxy types than they actually belong to ( cf .",
    "[ fig : class ] ) , or mergers to fall out of the merger regime as defined by @xcite and used by @xcite .",
    "this could partly explain that the visually assigned classes of @xcite intermingle when using the gini/@xmath3 criterion , but only few of their 52 galaxies should be affected by this .",
    "@xcite applied the gini coefficient in their analysis of quasar host galaxies , following the gini calculation of @xcite .",
    "their @xmath42 hst / acs imaging exposure times are @xmath43 times lower than the total exposure time of goods @xmath10 , corresponding to a difference in depth of @xmath44 mag .",
    "since all galaxies of their sample have magnitudes @xmath45 mag , their study does not suffer from @xmath9 effects on the gini values .",
    "based on cosmos @xcite hst / acs data , @xcite and @xcite applied the gini coefficient to study the evolution of the morphology - density relation , and to morphologically select faint agn , respectively .",
    "both rely on the gini calculation outlined in @xcite , using a `` quasi - petrosian '' aperture .",
    "a magnitude limit of @xmath46 mag is used by @xcite , whereas @xcite adopt @xmath47 mag .",
    "due to the larger pixel scale of the cosmos data as compared to goods , a galaxy would actually have a slightly larger @xmath9 per pixel in cosmos than in goods , despite the shallower depth of cosmos @xcite . taking this into account , @xmath4830% of galaxies with magnitudes close to the limit of @xcite fall below the @xmath9 criterion established above , and",
    "@xmath4815% of all galaxies brighter than the limit would do so .",
    "these authors separated early and late - type galaxies according to their gini value , and therefore probably missed a certain fraction of ( faint ) early types .",
    "since mostly galaxies at higher redshift should be affected , due to their lower overall @xmath9 , the growth rate of the early - type fraction with cosmic time determined by @xcite may have been slightly overestimated .    for the study of @xcite , @xmath4835% of galaxies close to the magnitude limit do not meet the @xmath9 criterion , and @xmath4820% of all galaxies brighter than the limit do so .",
    "they applied the gini coefficient to select compact sources that are likely to be agns by their high gini value .",
    "therefore , the authors might have missed a small fraction of galaxies at low @xmath9 levels with gini values close to the selection limit , which would have entered their agn candidate sample at larger @xmath9 .",
    "the fractions of @xmath9-affected galaxies given above for the study of @xcite also apply to the cosmos morphological classification presented by @xcite .",
    "this leads to a certain number of ( faint ) galaxies being classified as later types than they should , and is in agreement with @xcite s estimate that @xmath49 of faint early types could be misclassified as disks or irregulars . in their study of the morphology of distant star - forming galaxies in cosmos ,",
    "@xcite adopt a magnitude limit of @xmath50 mag , thus avoiding any significant @xmath9 effect .",
    "likewise , the selection of @xmath51 mag for cosmos and @xmath52 mag for goods ensured that no @xmath9 effect on the gini values affected the morphological analysis of @xcite , who presented a preliminary method for identifying bars based on radial gini profiles .",
    "@xcite stated that `` the gini coefficient remains a surprisingly robust statistic , even in the face of morphological @xmath53-corrections '' .",
    "this was based on their assessment of the robustness of the gini coefficient ( computed within the `` quasi - petrosian '' aperture ) , using an sdss reference sample of nearby galaxies for their hst / acs study of distant early - type galaxies .",
    "the galaxies in both their hst / acs sample and their sdss reference sample have a total @xmath54 .",
    "when compared to the goods data of the present study , indeed all galaxies with @xmath54 would meet the @xmath9-criterion established above , in accordance with @xcite s positive conclusion on the performance of the gini coefficient as morphology estimator .",
    "so far , most authors using the gini coefficient to describe galaxy morphology applied a reasonable magnitude and/or @xmath9 selection that prevented their investigations from being seriously affected by @xmath9 effects .",
    "however , i have shown that the gini coefficient depends strongly on the aperture within which it is computed , and that it exhibits a strong dependence on @xmath9 below a certain @xmath9 level ( which , again , depends on the aperture ) .",
    "therefore , quantitative selection criteria involving the gini coefficient  such as the merger selection of @xcite  can not be straightforwardly applied to a different dataset than the one for which they have been established ( cf . * ? ? ?",
    "care needs to be taken with the selection of aperture and limiting magnitude , as well as with the comparison of calculated gini values to those of other studies . from the analysis presented here , the use of the petrosian aperture is recommended .",
    "larger apertures are strongly disfavored due to their inclusion of many faint pixels .",
    "typically , the total @xmath9 or the @xmath9 per pixel are quoted as quantitative , but crude estimates of the `` quality '' of a galaxy s image . from these average values , it can of course not be seen whether a given galaxy image actually consists of pixels with very different individual @xmath9 values , or whether the @xmath9 of most pixels is similar  which might make a huge difference depending on the desired analysis .",
    "this pixel flux distribution is exactly what the gini coefficient , by definition , measures .",
    "one could thus conclude somewhat ironically that the gini coefficient could serve as a sophisticated measure of the @xmath9 distribution within a galaxy s image , if it did not depend so much on the galaxy s morphology .",
