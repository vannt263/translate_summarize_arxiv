    "the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclei was first studied using a skyrme interaction and focussed mostly on one component systems of just nucleons even though expressions were developed for two component systems of protons and neutrons @xcite .",
    "the phase transition aspects are considerably easier to study in one component systems rather than two , where for example one has to deal with separate proton and neutron chemical potentials for charge and nucleon number conservation .",
    "initial fragmentation models also mostly dealt with one component systems .",
    "such fragmentation studies gave the first evidence for the liquid - gas phase transition in nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "since then , the liquid - gas phase transition has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically .",
    "several reviews exist on this topic @xcite .    because of the two component nature of real nuclear systems , an analysis of liquid - gas phase transition in these systems is important .",
    "some preliminary results were reported in ref.@xcite , and a very detailed study was done by mller and serot @xcite who used a relativistic mean field model to develop the main thermodynamic properties of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "one interesting new aspect of two component system compared to one component system is that the phase transition is a second order transition in their approach .",
    "the importance of the number of components on the order of the transition was pointed out by glendenning @xcite .",
    "another interesting aspect of two component systems is the possibility of having different proton ",
    "neutron ratios in the liquid and gas phases because of the symmetry energy .",
    "the study of nuclear systems with arbitrary proton  neutron ratios is important for radioactive beam experiments and in astrophysical situations as in neutron stars . because of the extra degree of freedom associated with varying proton fraction @xmath0 in the two phases , the phase diagram has a higher dimensionality and now becomes a surface in pressure @xmath1 , temperature @xmath2 , and proton fraction @xmath0 or nucleon density @xmath3 . for one component systems the phase diagram",

    "we extend the initial study of ref.@xcite using skyrme interaction in a similar way as done in ref.@xcite .",
    "some features are qualitatively the same as in ref.@xcite , but quantitatively differ because of the different interaction .",
    "our equation of state based on the skyrme interaction with coulomb and surface effects has some feature also not present in ref.@xcite which will also be discussed . according to the results of ref.@xcite which has no coulomb interaction , the liquid phase has higher proton fraction than the gas phase of mixed phases in the coexistent state .",
    "a real nucleus has less protons than neutrons due to coulomb interaction . for a given @xmath9 stability",
    "is determined by coulomb and symmetry energy effects .",
    "since a stable finite nucleus has zero internal pressure while the gas phase having positive pressure @xcite , we also need to consider surface effects . in this paper",

    "fig.[fig3 ] shows chemical potential @xmath157 for various @xmath1 values at @xmath149 mev . from this figure we can find binodal points by checking the condition eq.([binodmu ] ) . there is a cross between the small density portion and high density portion of the curves for low pressure ( see the box at the right - bottom corner of fig.[fig3 ] ) , which has a discontinuity in @xmath122 shown in fig.[fig2 ] , for both @xmath12 and @xmath11",
    "the overall behavior is qualitatively similar to the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "however with coulomb interaction @xmath158 at @xmath128 instead of @xmath159 .",
    "the existence of these crossings of chemical potential curves between high and low density and between proton and neutron allow two pairs of binodal points at low @xmath1 as shown in the box at the right - upper cornner of fig.[fig4 ] .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows the coexistance binodal curve in @xmath0-@xmath1 plane at @xmath149 mev .",
    "the figure shows that the major effect of the surface tension is a lowering of the pressure for the coexistence curve ( compare dash - dotted curve _ vs _ dashed curve and solid curve _ vs _ dash - dot - dot - dotted curve ) .",
    "inclusion of surface tension may allow for a zero pressure isobaric phase transition and may simulate the situation of an equilibrated state of multifragmentation having zero internal pressure of stable finite nuclei with non - zero gas pressure as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "the effect of the coulomb interaction makes the coexistence curve smaller .",
    "however the more important effect of coulomb interaction is the appearence of another pair of binodal points in the low pressure region ( see the expanded figure in the box at the right upper corner ) .",
    "two points of smaller @xmath0 values have the same chemical potential and two points of larger @xmath0 values have the same chemical potential but which are different ( having increased @xmath12 and decreased @xmath11 ) from the other two ( see table [ tabl2 ] ) . here the points with largest and smallest @xmath0 value are in gas phase and the points between the other two @xmath0 values are in the liquid phase ( see table [ tabl2 ] ) .",
    "the binodal pair with higher @xmath0 values allows the mixture of gas with highest @xmath0 and liquid with the next high @xmath0 and is a reversed situation from the other binodal pairs and the result of ref.@xcite .",
    "this allows for a phase separation into a liquid phase with less proton ( lower @xmath0 value ) and a gas phase with more proton ( higher @xmath0 value ) which is more realistic in heavy ion collision .",
    "two pairs of binodal points meet together with the lowest pressure of the binodal curve at one point with @xmath151 for @xmath148 fm which would be changed to @xmath153 for @xmath152 fm . without coulomb interaction , the lowest pressure of the binodal curve occurs at @xmath128 .",
    "fig.[fig5 ] shows @xmath160 for various @xmath1 values at @xmath161 and 0.5 .",
    "this figure shows that at a low pressure there are two points with @xmath162 which make thermodynamic quantities have a first order discontinulty with @xmath2 variations .",
    "fig.[fig6 ] and fig.[fig7 ] shows @xmath163 and @xmath164 for various @xmath1 values at @xmath161 and 0.5 .",
    "comparing with the exact result ( dotted curve in fig.[fig6 ] ) , the fermi gas approximation used here is good for the region which corresponds to @xmath165 mev for the case without coulomb and surface effects .",
    "the points with diverging slope of @xmath61 and @xmath59 in variations with @xmath2 are related to the zero slope points in fig.[fig5 ] .",
    "if the charge concentration @xmath0 was kept constant in all phases then these two diverging points might be outside of the coexist region and cause a first order phase transition .",
    "however in the actual phase transition of a heavy ion collision these diverging points belong to the coexistence region and gives a second order phase transition as in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper we studied the liquid - gas phase transition in a hadronic system made of protons and neutrons or having two components .",
    "the approach used here was based on a mean filed theory and we calculated the mean potential energy using a skryme interaction .",
    "the work is an extension of a previous study initially begone in ref.@xcite for two components and the analysis is similar in some ways to that developed in ref.@xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we included surface and coulomb effects so our results differ quantitavely from those in ref.@xcite . including coulomb and surface effects introduces some feature also not present in ref.@xcite    the importance of surface energies in the liquid - gas phase transition",
    "was shown in ref.@xcite using an approach based on a statistical model of multifragmentation . in the statistical model of multifragmentation , because nuclear matter can be broken into a large number of small pieces , the surface energy plays a very dominant role .",
    "here , in a mean field theory , the surface energy plays a lesser role since we do not allow for the possibility of multifragmentation .",
    "rather , the system is treated as uniform but with varying density .",
    "surface tension here brings the coexistance binodal surface to lower pressure which could allow an isobaric transition at zero pressure .",
    "inclusion of coulomb interaction brings a new feature in a mean field approach .",
    "the coulomb interaction makes the binodal surface smaller and cause another pair of binodal points at low pressure with a reversed proton fraction in the liquid - gas phase , i.e. with less protons in liquid phase amd more protons in gas phase .",
    "the value of the proton fraction @xmath0 for the liquid phase of this binodal pair is larger than the @xmath0 values for the lowest pressure point of the binodal curve as can be seen in the box in fig.[fig4 ] and we can make this value smaller by using a stronger coulomb interaction .",
    "in this paper we used a fixed value of @xmath166 to determine the strength of coulomb interaction and surface tension .",
    "if we allow for variations of @xmath166 with @xmath3 or @xmath2 and allow different values for the coulomb and surface energies , then this simple model may be used to study multifragmentation with various size of clusters .",
