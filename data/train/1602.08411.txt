    "the phase transitions lines are highlighted in fig.[fig : chiralcurrent](a ) by the white dashed curve , eq.([eq : totcurtransition ] ) , and the dot - dashed white curve , eq.([eq : qptransition ] ) .",

    "here we discuss some properties of the system which can be derived from symmetry considerations . we will first show the effect of changing @xmath110 , section [ sec : mphi ] , then of linear changes of the baths parameters @xmath111 , section [ sec : shift ] , symmetry properties of the total and chiral current depending on the configuration , [ sec : configs ] , and last for the case of @xmath77 , sections [ sec : evenrungs ] and [ sec : oddrungs ] .",
    "let us consider a transformation from @xmath112 .",
    "the dissipation is untouched , while the new hamiltonian @xmath113 is such that @xmath114 ( the complex conjugate of @xmath34 ) .",
    "we thus have that @xmath115 . denoting the quadratic observables of the new system as @xmath116 , using the particular form of @xmath32 and the fact that @xmath27 and @xmath28 are diagonal , it can be proved ( see appendix ) that @xmath117 this implies that , unlike in the unitary system for which the current is antisymmetric for a change of @xmath110 , in the dissipative case it is symmetric . for instance the rung current for a phase @xmath118 , from eq.([eq : rungcurrent ] ) , @xmath119 where @xmath120 takes the imaginary part of its argument .",
    "similarly for the leg current , from eq.([eq : legcurrent ] ) , @xmath121      let us consider a change in @xmath39 such that @xmath122 , where @xmath123 means the identity matrix .",
    "it is straightforward , from eq.([eq : pxxp ] ) , to see that @xmath116 satisfies the equation @xmath124 with @xmath125 .",
    "the consequences of eq.([eq : shiftx ] ) is apparent .",
    "@xmath116 will be a solution to another system with @xmath126 but with an average occupation shifted as @xmath127 .",
    "a change in the average occupation fixed by the dissipation thus only change the local occupations but not the currents nor the kinetic energy .    in a similar manner",
    "it is also easy to realize that @xmath128 is the solution to the system with the same @xmath32 and @xmath21 , but @xmath129 .",
    "a natural consequence of the results in this subsection is that it is possible to compute the observables for the case in which one boundary is set to @xmath130 while the other to any value and then compute all the other possible cases by a shift or a dilation in @xmath23 .      in this section",
    "we analyse the symmetry of both the hamiltonian and the dissipation .",
    "first , it is easy to see that if there is a unitary transformation @xmath131 such that @xmath132 , which is @xmath133 , then @xmath116 satisfies @xmath134 which means that @xmath116 is the solution to the system with @xmath135 , @xmath136 .      in the @xmath8 configuration",
    ", we define the transformation @xmath131 such that it has non - zero elements only on the anti - diagonal , @xmath137 , then we have @xmath138 and @xmath139 satisfies @xmath140 and @xmath141 . from section [ sec : shift ] , we know that the off diagonal terms of @xmath39 are invariant to a shift of @xmath27 by a scalar .",
    "so we can just set @xmath142 , and this will not affect the off diagonal terms . then we find that @xmath143 and @xmath27 are related by @xmath144 denoting @xmath145 ( as @xmath146 is a function of @xmath34 , it is also a function of @xmath4 which we now show explicitly ) , we can thus write @xmath147 eq.([eq : rconfpprime ] ) , together with eqs.([eq : rungcurphi],[eq : legcurphi ] ) and considering that the current is independent of a constant shift in @xmath27 , results in @xmath148 and @xmath149      for the @xmath10 configuration the system hamiltonian is invariant under the transformation @xmath150 , @xmath151 , and the dissipation will be reverted .",
    "therefore @xmath152 and we can write @xmath153 again , since the current is independent of a constant shift of @xmath27 , we can state that @xmath154 and @xmath155 we can hence derive that the chiral current @xmath156 in the @xmath10 configuration .      in this case the system has the symmetry of both the @xmath8 configuration and the @xmath10 configuration .",
    "this means we have @xmath157 which also implies that the current on the rungs @xmath158 , and the chiral current are 0 .      for an even number of rungs , @xmath159",
    ", we can arrange the hamiltonian such that @xmath160 the coefficient matrix @xmath161 can be written as @xmath162 where @xmath163,@xmath164,@xmath165,@xmath166 are @xmath167 matrix with the only non - zero components being @xmath168 , @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172 , @xmath173 .",

    "hence there will be no connections between the two sub blocks , and each sub system will reach steady state independentely . this exact symmetry for @xmath77 and even number of rungs",
    "has an interesting consequence .",
    "in fact this implies that , even as @xmath11 increases the value of the total current for even or odd number of sites ladders will have a finite difference .      in case",
    "@xmath188 we can arrange the hamiltonian similarly to eq.([eq : grouping ] ) where the coefficient matrix @xmath161 has an identical structure to eq.([eq : hm ] ) .",

    "is connected to the the baths , which implies the existence of @xmath193 modes dark modes .",
    "we have analyzed a rich quantum system in which , depending of the hamiltonian parameter , there can be a quantum phase transtion and a gap opening .",
    "we have shown that these two features can be used to gain a high degree of control of the transport properties of the system when it is coupled to baths at its boundaries .",
    "most importantly , we have shown how the characteristics of the system can change significantly depending on the geometry of the system - bath coupling .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the interplay between ( 1 ) the current - imposing baths at the boundaries , ( 2 ) their geometrical coupling to the ladder and ( 3 ) a gauge field which tends to alter the current flow and causes significant changes in the energy spectrum of the bulk system , results in non - equilibrium phase transitions in which the magnitude and the pattern of the current transported can change significantly .",
    "this phenomenology extends and differs significantly from the one studied in the groundstate of the hamiltonian system .",
    "we have shown the presence of two regions in which chiral currents can emerge and we have connected the boundaries of these regions with ( i ) the emergence of two minima in the energy spectrum and ( ii ) an opening of a gap between the lower and higher bands .",
    "the opening of the gap also causes a significant reduction of the total current transported for asymmetric system - bath couplings .",
    "we have also complemented our analysis with symmetry considerations which allow us to show that chiral current is non - zero only in the @xmath8 configuration , and the peculiar behavior for @xmath77 .",
