    "over the last decade it has been established that a large body of information concerning quantum many - body systems can be extracted from the study of their entanglement properties  @xcite . at present",
    ", there are many examples of this connection spanning a wide spectrum of phenomena in quantum statistical mechanics and condensed matter physics .",
    "entanglement , for example , is tightly connected to the topological properties of many - body systems  @xcite and to the emergence of quantum phase transitions  @xcite . in particular , the entanglement entropy , which obeys an area law for gapped systems , is known to acquire logarithmic corrections at criticality  @xcite .",
    "understanding entanglement is also very useful for the description of the non - equilibrium dynamics of quantum many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "for example , while the block entropy @xmath0 in the ground state of a one dimensional system either saturates or grows logarithmically as a function of block length , calabrese and cardy  @xcite have shown that after a quench , as a result of dephasing , @xmath0 obeys a volume law after a linear increase with time .",
    "the increase with time is slower in the presence of disorder  @xcite , with a distinct logarithmic behaviour characterizing the many - body localised states  @xcite .",
    "these considerations can be generalised to the case of linear ramps  @xcite , relevant for the kibble - zurek - type experiments , or to the case of periodic driving  @xcite    at present , most of the studies of entanglement in many body systems have focused on the bipartite case ( either two - site or two - block as in the entanglement entropy ) while much less is known about multipartite entanglement , i.e. entanglement between multiple , @xmath1 , subsystems  @xcite .",
    "although several important works point to the importance of this concept in the understanding of collective behaviour of many - body systems  @xcite , the overall picture is far less clear than for bipartite entanglement .",
    "the main reason is that the quantification and classification of multipartite entanglement is fairly more complex and full of open problems ( of interest also in mathematics , see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "though a complete classification is still out of sight , very promising studies of multipartite entanglement have been performed in specific many - body systems  @xcite .",
    "an overview of the field can be found in the review by ghne and tth  @xcite .",
    "a very appealing quantity characterizing the degree of multipartite entanglement through a bound is the quantum fisher information ( qfi )  @xcite .",
    "while the qfi was originally introduced to quantify phase parameter estimation , it has been shown  @xcite that certain types of multipartite entanglement could be inferred from its scaling with the system size ( more precisely from the coefficient of the linear dependence on the size ) .",
    "most importantly , the qfi has been shown to be related to a dynamical susceptibility for a system in a thermal state  @xcite .",
    "since susceptibilities can be experimentally measured also for quite large systems , this suggests an easy way to experimentally probe multipartite entanglement and bypass existing protocols , which exponentially scale with the system size , can be bypassed .",
    "an important consequence of this connection is that , in critical systems , the qfi inherits the scaling properties from the susceptibilities .",
    "therefore the qfi in many - body systems shows critical scaling at a quantum phase transition like any thermodynamic quantity  @xcite .    as mentioned above ,",
    "while the dynamics of bipartite entanglement has received a lot of attention  @xcite , the multipartite case has been much less investigated until now .",
    "the connection between qfi and susceptibilities suggests the possibility to extend the study of multipartite entanglement not only to equilibrium situations but also to non - equilibrium . with this goal in mind , in this paper we propose the first systematic analysis of multipartite entanglement of a quantum many - body system out - of - equilibrium .",
    "we consider an isolated quantum system subject to a quantum quench protocol : a parameter of the hamiltonian is suddenly changed and the ensuing unitary evolution is studied .",
    "we show that in the long time limit one can relate the value of the asymptotic qfi to a generalized response function , thus generalizing the results obtained by hauke _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to a non - equilibrium situation .",
    "the properties of the dynamics of multipartite entanglement after a quantum quench will be discussed in detail in the case of a one - dimensional ising model in a transverse field .",
    "depending on the nature and type of quench , multipartite correlations may play a prominent role in the dynamics of the quantum chains .",
    "in particular , we will show that the structure of entanglement in the steady state depends crucially on whether the initial condition is ferromagnetic or paramagnetic . in the first case , there is no limitation on the degree of multipartiteness achievable and the smaller the quench the higher the entanglement . in the second ,",
    "the degree of multipartiteness is both limited and maximal only close to the equilibrium critical point .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ multiparty : sec ]",
    "we briefly review the definition and quantification of multipartite entanglement through the quantum fisher information .",
    "section  [ fisher_quench : sec ] is the core of our paper : there we discuss the behaviour of the qfi after a quantum quench .",
    "we show that , under very general conditions , it relaxes to an asymptotic value given by the fluctuations of an operator over the so - called diagonal ensemble density matrix , and we relate this quantity to a generalized response function . for a thermal state ,",
    "the expression we have obtained reduces to the one found by hauke _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite at thermal equilibrium . equipped with this formalism , in section  [ results : sec ]",
    "we discuss in detail the properties of the qfi density for the quantum ising chain in transverse field , after a quench in the external field .",
    "we find that the system almost always shows multipartite entanglement ; moreover the degree of multipartiteness diverges for infinitesimal quenches applied to the system in the ferromagnetic phase .",
    "there is indeed no limitation on the degree of multipartiteness which can be achieved and this is strictly connected to a divergence of the correlation length . finally in section",
    "[ conclusion : sec ] we draw our conclusions and discuss perspectives for future work .",
    "in this section , in order to keep the presentation self - contained , we briefly review the classification of multipartite entanglement and we discuss in detail how to measure it by means of the quantum fisher information .",

    "we follow the original works , refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure of entanglement for a partition of a system in more than two subsystems is very rich and a complete general classification and quantification of multipartite entanglement is not yet available .",
    "therefore , in order to use a definition of multipartite entanglement as precise as possible let us follow the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite and , considering a state of @xmath2 particles , start with the following definitions of @xmath3-producible pure states and @xmath3-particle entangled pure states .",
    "_ definition : @xmath3-producible pure states - _ a pure state @xmath4 is @xmath3 producible ( producible by @xmath3-partite entanglement ) if it can be written as @xmath5 , where @xmath6 are non - producible states of @xmath7 particles ( such that @xmath8 ) . for example , for @xmath9 particles , 1 producible , 2 producible and 3 producible states can be constructed as @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 respectively .    _ definition : genuine @xmath3-partite entangled pure states . _",
    "a pure state @xmath13 is called _ @xmath3-partite entangled _ if it is @xmath3-producible , but not @xmath14-producible .",
    "therefore , a @xmath3-partite entangled state can be written as a product @xmath15 , which contains at least one state @xmath6 of @xmath16 particles which does not factorise . in the previous examples ,",
    "@xmath11 is a @xmath17entangled states if @xmath18 .",
    "similarly a greenbergen - horne - zeilinger state is a @xmath19-entangled state .",
    "these definitions are extended to mixed states by the convex combination exactly as done in the case of bipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "several different possible ways to quantify multipartite entanglement have be proposed in the literature .",
    "they include geometric measures  @xcite , global entanglement measures  @xcite and there are also proposals based on concurrence  @xcite , on the distribution of purities  @xcite for different bi - partitions or on the construction of appropriate monotones  @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , in this work we choose to focus on a specific quantity , the quantum fisher information ( qfi ) , let us define and discuss in detail the qfi .",
    "its classical counterpart , the fisher information , is used in information theory to evaluate how precise can be the estimate of a parameter @xmath20 , upon which a probability distribution @xmath21 depends , from measurements of the random variable @xmath22 only .",
    "it is defined as the variance of the score function @xmath23 , i.e. @xmath24 this quantity gives a bound on the information on @xmath20 that can be obtained from an estimator @xmath25 . in particular",
    "one can easily prove the cramer - rao bound , @xmath26 : the higher @xmath27 the better can in principle be our estimate of @xmath20 .",
    "it is possible to apply the same logic to quantum systems . to construct a probability distribution in the quantum case we can , for example ,",
    "prepare a probe state @xmath28 , and apply to it a unitary transformation @xmath29 : @xmath20 is an unknown phase shift characterizing the transformation and @xmath30 is the operator that generates it .",
    "the parameter @xmath20 could now be inferred by performing a measure on the shifted probe state @xmath31 .",
    "typically the results are given by a povm ( positive operator valued measure  @xcite ) with @xmath32 independent elements @xmath33 and corresponding outcomes @xmath34 .",
    "for each outcome @xmath35 we can obtain an estimator @xmath36 ; performing infinite realizations of the measurement process we obtain the average @xmath37 of the estimator on the resulting probability distribution and its variance @xmath38 . similarly to the classical case , this variance has been proven to obey a bound  @xcite : @xmath39 , where @xmath27 is the fisher information defined as in eq.([generalfisher ] ) with the probability distribution @xmath40 .",
    "it is now possible to introduce a quantity @xmath41 characterizing the usefulness of a quantum state for phase estimation given the operator @xmath30 .",
    "this can be done by maximizing @xmath27 over all possible povms measurements : the result is defined as the quantum fisher information . since @xmath42 the bound @xmath43 follows ( quantum version of the cramer - rao bound ) .",
    "for pure states , the qfi is simply given by the variance of the operator that induces the phase shift , @xmath44 . if instead we consider a mixed state as an input @xmath45 ( with @xmath46 ) , the quantum fisher information can be written  @xcite in terms of the eigenvalues of the input state and of the matrix elements of the phase shift operator @xmath30 as @xmath47    let us now finally come to the connection between qfi and multipartite entanglement .",
    "this was thoroughly explored in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors considered a system of @xmath2 @xmath48-spins  @xcite subject to phase shift generated by @xmath49 : for each @xmath50 , @xmath51 is a vector on the bloch sphere and @xmath52 is the vector of the pauli matrices associated to the spin @xmath53 .",
    "the authors found an inequality relating the multipartite entanglement properties of the considered state and the qfi optimised over all the possible choices of @xmath54 .",
    "for @xmath3-producible states , the result is @xmath55 \\leq sk^2+r^2 $ ] , where @xmath56 ( and @xmath57 is the largest integer smaller or equal @xmath58 ) and @xmath59 . given a probe state @xmath28 ,",
    "if the bound is violated , then the probe state contains useful @xmath60-partite entanglement .",
    "when @xmath3 is a divisor of n the bound further simplifies if expressed in terms of the optimal _ quantum fisher information density_. for a @xmath60-entangled state it must be @xmath61 . at the same time if the state is @xmath60-entangled , then @xmath62 ( otherwise the state would be @xmath63 entangled and so on ) . we consequently obtain the fundamental inequality connecting optimal qfi density : a state is @xmath64-partite entangled if and only if @xmath65 in the next sections , we are going to apply this inequality to the study of the multipartite entanglement in a system subjected to a quantum quench .",
    "the purpose of this work is to study multipartite entanglement in a many - body system in non - equilibrium conditions . in particular",
    ", we will consider the dynamics of thermally isolated quantum systems following a quantum quench , i.e. a rapid change of the system parameters .",
    "the system is initialised in a given ( possibly mixed ) many - body state , and is let free to evolve in time under the action of an hamiltonian @xmath66 . in the thermodynamic limit , local observables and correlation functions are expected to attain a stationary value at large times .",
    "this stationary conditions will be described eventually by the diagonal ensemble obtained by time averaging the density matrix . in order to characterize multipartite entanglement both in the transient and in the stationary state we now aim at studying the qfi in such conditions . in the special case of thermal equilibrium , the qfi can be expressed in terms of a dynamical response function  @xcite : it would be highly desirable to have a similar expression for a generic non - equilibrium situation .",
    "below , we generalize the result of ref .",
    "@xcite to a many - body system subject to a quantum quench , and show that also in this case the qfi can be expressed in terms of a",

    "we have then discussed in detail the structure of entanglement in the stationary condition attained by a specific model : the quantum ising chain after a quench in the transverse field .",
    "we have found two different scenarios , depending on the initial condition being ferromagnetic or paramagnetic . in the first case",

    "the degree of multipartiteness is limited ( while it tends to diverge as @xmath211 ) and attains a maximum only close to the equilibrium critical point @xmath212 .",
    "a possibility of future work will be to study multipartite entanglement in periodically driven systems , both in the asymptotic condition  @xcite and in the floquet ground state  @xcite ( the latter is an eigenstate of the stroboscopic dynamics which can undergo quantum phase transitions ) .",
    "in addition , it would be interesting to address the quantum fisher information in disordered systems , both in connection with quantum phase transitions at equilibrium  @xcite and many body localization  @xcite . especially in the latter case , there are detailed analyses of bipartite entanglement  @xcite but an analysis of the multipartite case , with the notable exception of refs.@xcite , is still missing .",

    "this is a very important result : it allows to measure the multipartite entanglement in the laboratory ( there are well established experimental methods to measure susceptibilities independently of the size of the considered system ) .",
    "so one would be tempted to directly generalize this result , at least for the stationary state , with a susceptibility averaged over the diagonal ensemble  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , far from equilibrium , this would be wrong for a general system even for a pure initial state .",
    "this follows from the fact that the fluctuation - dissipation theorem  @xcite , which at equilibrium relates the keldysh component of the response function to the linear susceptibility as @xmath213 , is not valid in this general form in the non - equilibrium case @xcite .",
