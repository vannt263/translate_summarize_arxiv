    "laser - cooling @xcite allows to cool ions and atoms to very low temperatures . for this purpose",
    ", the full knowledge of the effects of the various physical parameters determining the cooling process is very important . among the various schemes ,",
    "raman sideband cooling has been demonstrated to be a very successful technique for preparing atoms in the ground state of a harmonic potential @xcite .",
    "this cooling method exploits two stable or metastable atomic internal levels , which we call @xmath0 and @xmath1 , connected by dipole transitions to a common excited state @xmath2 . the transitions are usually driven by alternating pulses . a typical sequence alternates a coherent pulse ,",
    "in which the atom is coherently transferred from @xmath0 to @xmath1 via a properly designed raman pulse , with a re - pumping pulse , in which the atom is incoherently re - scattered to @xmath0 by means of a laser resonant with @xmath3 .",
    "a change of the motional state during the repumping is a process of higher order in the ratio @xmath4 of the recoil frequency @xmath5 and the trap frequency @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the mass of the atom and @xmath8 the wave vector of the one - photon transition . in the lamb - dicke regime , where @xmath9 , the probability for a change of the motional state is negligible and therefore , on the average , the system is cooled at a rate of one phonon of energy @xmath10 per cooling cycle . since there is a finite probability for the atom to be returned to the state @xmath1 instead of being repumped , a number of incoherent scattering events may be required before the atom is finally scattered into @xmath0 , which significantly increases the motional energy at the end of the optical pumping , reducing the cooling efficiency .",
    "furthermore , since two and three level schemes are realized using zeeman or hyperfine substates , decays from @xmath2 into other electronic substates can occur , leading to additional heating .",
    "+ in this work we quantify the effect of a finite branching ratio in pulsed raman sideband cooling by calculating the average shift and diffusion of the vibrational energy distribution at the end of an incoherent pumping pulse .",
    "it should be pointed out that theoretical studies on laser - cooling for multilevel ions exist , which systematically include the branching ratio in their treatments @xcite .",
    "those studies have focussed on the lamb - dicke regime and on certain cooling schemes . here",
    ", we single out the effect of the branching ratio on cooling for an arbitrary ratio @xmath4 by applying sum rules .",
    "hence , we infer the cooling efficiency in the lamb - dicke regime and we discuss the result outside the lamb - dicke regime in connection with the proposal in @xcite . in particular ,",
    "we show that in some parameter ranges the average effect of the multiple photon scattering can be described with an effective wave vector @xmath11 for the `` effective '' two - level transition @xmath12 @xcite . +",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce the model for the evolution of a trapped ion during the repumping pulse in a raman transition , and we evaluate the average shift and variance of the ion energy at the end of the pulse . in section 3",
    "we extend our analysis to cases where the channels of decay are multiple . in section 4",
    "we draw some conclusions , and in the appendix we report the details of our calculations .",

    "the interaction of the ion with the laser light is described in the dipole approximation by the operator @xmath32 :    @xmath33    with @xmath34 ( with @xmath35 ) dipole raising operator , @xmath36 its adjoint , and @xmath30 the position of the atom . in writing ( [ coherent1 ] ) , ( [ master0 ] )",
