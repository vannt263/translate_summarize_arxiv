    "the security of coherent state continuous variable quantum key distribution ( cv - qkd ) @xcite is fundamentally based on the inability of an eavesdropper to perfectly distinguish between non - orthogonal quantum states @xcite . in this paper , we look at how much information a potential eavesdropper can gain when trying to distinguish between two pure coherent states as opposed to distinguishing between two mixed coherent states .",
    "this is of particular interest in cv - qkd protocols , such as post - selection @xcite ) , where it is important to determine if an eavesdropper obtained more information in the case of distinguishing between two pure coherent states or distinguishing between two mixed states .",
    "in our analysis , we will use the _ probability of error _ ( @xmath0 ) measure to distinguish between quantum states .",
    "we point out that one could potentially consider other distinguishability measures such as the kolmogorov distance , the bhattacharyya coefficient and the shannon distinguishability ( for a review of these measures see @xcite ) .",
    "however , as we shall see the probability of error measure has a number of useful properties and can be directly calculated for the quantum states we consider in our analysis .",
    "we consider the distinguishability between two general quantum states that are described by the two density matrices @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it was originally shown by helstrom @xcite that the probability of error between these two density matrices is minimized by performing an optimal positive operator - valued measure ( povm ) @xcite . in this case , the probability of error for the distinguishing between two general quantum states can be expressed as @xcite @xmath3 $ ] and @xmath4 are the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath5 .",
    "we note that when the two states are indistinguishable the probability of error is @xmath6 . on the other hand , in the case",

    "we now look at distinguishing between two coherent states using the previously defined probability of error .",
    "a coherent state is defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the displacement operator .",
    "it is also a minimum uncertainty state and an eigenstate of the annihilation operator @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave @xcite .",
    "any two coherent states @xmath16 and @xmath17 are always non - orthogonal and only approach orthogonality ( i.e. @xmath18 ) when @xmath19 where the magnitude is @xmath20 . in the following analysis",
    "we will define a coherent state displace in the amplitude and phase quadratures @xcite , by an amount @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively , as @xmath23 .",
    "consequently , we can write the density operators of two pure coherent states @xmath24 and @xmath25 that we consider here as @xmath26 in our analysis we also consider two mixed coherent states , i.e. an equally weighted mixture of coherent states mirrored in the phase quadrature and with both mixtures having the same amplitude component .",

    "we need to determine the eigenvalues of @xmath30 for both the two pure states and two mixed states . to do this we write @xmath31 in its matrix representation which can be expanded in terms of the orthogonal fock or number states @xmath32 defined as @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the creation operator of a harmonic oscillator and @xmath35 .",
    "for example , the coherent state @xmath36 written in terms of this fock basis is @xmath37 once @xmath31 is written in matrix form we can then numerically determine its eigenvalues . in this fock state expansion the inner product of an arbitrary coherent state with a fock state is given by @xmath38 where @xmath32 and @xmath39 are fock states . calculating the general matrix coefficients for the case of the two pure coherent states we obtain @xmath40\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] similarly for the two mixed state case we find @xmath41\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",

    "now having numerically calculated @xmath0 we would like to interpret this in terms of the information gained from using the distinguishing measure .",
    "in the context of cv - qkd it is important to determine how much shannon information an eavesdropper can obtain by distinguishing between two ( pure or mixed ) quantum states . the information obtained by distinguishing between two states can be calculated using the shannon information formula for a binary symmetric channel @xcite @xmath44 figure  ( [ 3d_plot ] ) shows the difference between the shannon information obtained by distinguishing between two coherent states @xmath45 compared with distinguishing between two mixed states @xmath46 .",
    "this information difference is defined as @xmath47 .",

    "we have expanded up to @xmath49 fock states , i.e. @xmath50 in our numerical analysis .",
    "there are two main features of this plot .",
    "firstly , we notice that , given our distinguishability measure and initial configuration of coherent states in phase space , two mixed states never give more information than two pure state , i.e. @xmath51 .",
    "secondly , there is a flat region where the information gain is zero , i.e. the information from distinguishing between two mixed states is the same as that of two pure states .",
    "this means as we move the states further and further apart in the amplitude quadrature ( while keeping the phase quadrature fixed ) , the probability of error tends to zero and hence an information gain of zero .",
    "the same result occurs when the amplitude quadrature is fixed while varying the phase quadrature .",
    "this is somewhat surprising because the more separated two mixed states become the more indistinguishable they are and consequently less information can be extracted .",
    "but in this case what it is telling us is that at some point the two mixed states start  behaving \" like two pure states .    .",
    "in this case the two mixed states never give more information than two pure states.,width=302 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol where an eavesdropper needs to distinguish between two pure coherent states , rather than two mixed coherent states ( where the various mixtures have the same amplitude component ) , the eavesdropper will never get more information from the two mixed coherent states .",
    "we showed this using the probability of error as the distinguishability measure along with the shannon information formula ."
