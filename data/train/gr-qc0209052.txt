    "the general theory of relativity is thought to provide the correct classical description for the interaction of gravity with matter .",
    "this description is embodied in a system of partial differential equations on a four dimensional manifold @xmath0 , the so - called _ einstein equations _ , which relate the ricci curvature @xmath1 of an unknown metric @xmath2 to the energy - momentum tensor @xmath3 of matter : @xmath4 to complete the classical picture of a physics based on a collection of fields satisfying a closed system of equations , one must also consider the laws which govern the evolution of the matter fields generating the energy - momentum tensor on the right hand side of @xmath5 .",
    "( one important special case is when there is no matter , the so - called vacuum .",
    "then @xmath5 with vanishing right hand side is a closed system of quasilinear hyperbolic equations . ) in general , one arrives at quite complicated systems of equations .",
    "however , from the perspective of classical physics , all phenomena are in principle described by the solutions of such a system . moreover , for these systems , the initial value problem is natural , just as in classical dynamics .",
    "thus , from one point of view , the general theory of relativity is a classical physical theory that can be studied mathematically in parallel with other field theories of nineteenth - century classical physics .",
    "indeed , the equations of general relativity exhibit similar local behavior with other equations of evolution as regards , for instance , the issues of local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the initial value problem .",
    "when one turns , however , to the initial value problem in the large , the einstein equations present features that have no analogue in other typical equations of mathematical physics .",
    "the subject of this talk will be what appears , at least at first sight , as the most pathological of these features , namely the possibility of loss of uniqueness of the solution of the initial value problem _ without loss of regularity .",
    "_ this possibility is at the center of what is known as the _ strong cosmic censorship conjecture _ formulated by penrose  @xcite .",
    "the reason why the theory of the initial value problem in the large for the einstein equations is richer than for other non - linear wave equations is that the global geometry of the characteristics is not constrained _ a priori _ by any other structure .",
    "this geometry , which corresponds precisely to the conformal geometry for the vacuum equations , is _ a priori _ unknown .",
    "it turns out that many features of the initial value problem for hyperbolic equations that one takes for granted actually depend on certain global properties of the geometry of the characteristics ; the question of uniqueness indicated above is one of these .",
    "the best way to gain some intuition for what kind of conformal geometric structure develops in the course of evolution in general relativity  and what are the implications of this structure  is to carefully examine the special solutions of the theory .",
    "in fact , almost all conjectures and intuition regarding the theory in the end derives from simple properties of such solutions . moreover",
    ", since our focus of interest is global _ geometric _ structure , there is no substitute in building intuition than a good pictorial representation .",
    "this talk will rely very much on such `` pictures '' .",
    "it should be noted , however , that in the spherically symmetric context in which we shall be working , these `` pictures '' , besides conveying intuition , also carry complete and precise information and can be treated on the same level as symbols or formulas .",
    "the assumption of spherical symmetry and associated pictorial representations will be carefully discussed in the next section .",
    "we will then proceed to examine a series of special solutions which will lead to a particular initial value problem .",
    "finally , theorems describing the solutions of the initial value problem will be formulated and their proofs will be discussed .    in regard to uniqueness , it turns out that there is always a spacetime which can be uniquely associated to initial data - manifold @xmath6 , along with a symmetric @xmath7-tensor @xmath8 satisfying the constraint equations that would arise if @xmath8 were to be the second fundamental form of @xmath0 realized as a hypersurface in a ricci flat @xmath9-manifold . ] .",
    "this is the so - called _ maximal domain of development _",
    "it is the `` biggest '' spacetime which admits the given initial hypersurface as initial data and is at the same time _ globally hyperbolic _",
    ", i.e.  all inextendible causal curves intersect the initial hypersurface precisely once .",
    "this latter property ensures that the domain of dependence property holds .",
    "the question of uniqueness in general relativity is thus the issue of the _ extendiblity _ of this maximal domain of development .",
    "if it is extendible , then the solution is not unique .",
    "since , as noted earlier , there is really no substitute for a pictorial representation , we defer further discussion of this till later on .",
    "the current state of affairs in the theory of quasilinear hyperbolic partial differential equations in several space variables is such that global , large data problems appear beyond reach . for there to be any hope of making headway",
    ", it seems that some sort of reduction must be made to a problem where the number of the independent variables is no more than two . for hyperbolic equations of evolution ,",
    "such reductions in general are accomplished by considering symmetric solutions , or equivalently , symmetric initial data . in general relativity ,",
    "symmetry assumptions are formulated in terms of a group which acts by isometry on the spacetime and preserves all matter .",
    "the only @xmath7-dimensional symmetry group that is compatible with the notion of an isolated gravitating system , i.e.  that can act on asymptotically flat spacetimes , is @xmath10 .",
    "solutions invariant under such an action are called _ spherically symmetric_. as we shall see below , most of the expected phenomena of gravitational collapse of isolated gravitating systems , and the fundamental questions that these phenomena pose , can be suggested by the spherically symmetric solutions of various einstein - matter systems .",
    "moreover , the conformal structure of these solutions , which is the essential ingredient for the phenomena we wish to discuss , can be completely represented on the blackboard .",
    "( or on paper ! ) the reason for this is simple : the space of group orbits @xmath11 can be given the structure of a @xmath7-dimensional lorentzian manifold .",
    "restricting to @xmath12 which are _ maximal domains of development _ of initial data , it follows that these can be globally conformally represented as bounded domains in @xmath13-dimensional minkowski space",
    ". the images of such representations are called _ penrose diagrams _ ; from these , the conformal geometry can be immediately read off as the characteristics are just the lines at @xmath14 or @xmath15 radians from the horizontal : @xmath16",
    "to gain some familiarity with these diagrams , it is perhaps best to begin with @xmath9-dimensional minkowski space from this point of view , i.e.  with the penrose diagram of the maximal domain of development of minkowski initial data .",
    "here the diagram is as follows : @xmath17 the @xmath18 referred to above is a function on @xmath12 defined to be a multiple of the square root of the area of the group orbit corresponding to the points of @xmath12 .",
    "the line labelled @xmath19 is thus the axis of symmetry .",
    "the line labelled  future null infinity \" is not part of the spacetime but should be thought of as a `` boundary '' at infinity .",
    "the same applies to its two endpoints , `` spacelike infinity '' and `` future timelike infinity '' .",
    "the latter corresponds to the `` endpoint '' of all inextendible future timelike geodesics .",
    "the above minkowski space is of course future causally geodesically complete , i.e.  all causal curves can be extended to infinite affine parameter .",
    "thus we have the analogue of global existence and uniqueness . that these properties of minkowski space are stable to small perturbations ( _ without _ any symmetry assumptions )",
    "is a deep theorem of christodoulou and klainerman  @xcite .",
    "having understood the conformal diagram of minkowski space , we turn to a more interesting solution : the schwarzschild solution .",
    "this is actually a one - parameter family of solutions ( the parameter is called mass and denoted by @xmath20 ) which contains minkowski space ( the case where @xmath21 ) .",
    "as it is a spherically symmetric vacuum solution , its non - triviality in the case @xmath22 must be generated by topology .",
    "any cauchy hypersurface has two asymptotically flat ends and topology @xmath23 .",
    "`` downstairs '' , this corresponds to a line with two @xmath24 endpoints , not intersecting an axis of symmetry . for convenience , we will choose a time - symmetric initial hypersurface .",
    "the maximal development of this `` schwarzschild '' initial data then looks like : @xmath25 the point @xmath26 depicted where @xmath27 is a minimal surface `` upstairs '' in the initial hypersurface .",
    "as the initial hypersurface was chosen to be time symmetric , this minimal surface is also what is called marginally trapped .",
    "the `` ingoing '' and `` outgoing '' null cones emanating from this surface , which correspond to the two null rays through @xmath26 `` downstairs '' , can thus not reach `` future null infinity '' .",
    "( this is related to the so - called `` singularity theorems '' of penrose . )",
    "moreover , all timelike geodesics emanating from the point @xmath26 reach in finite time the curve @xmath19 .",
    "this curve is not an axis of symmetry but a @xmath28 singularity !",
    "that is to say , there is no extension of the spacetime above through @xmath19 with a continuous lorentzian metric .",
    "this singular behavior of the schwarzschild solution may at first appear to be an undesirable feature .",
    "indeed , historically , it was first considered exactly as such .",
    "but it turns out in fact that the behavior outlined above would provide the `` ideal '' scenario for the end - state of gravitational collapse .",
    "this has to do with two specific features of this solution :    1 .",
    "labelling the null rays emanating from the minimal surface as @xmath29 , it turns out that there is a class of timelike observers , namely those who do not cross @xmath29 , who can observe for infinite time and whose causal past is completely regular .",
    "the singularity is hidden inside a black hole , and @xmath29 is called the event horizon . to be more precise about the `` completeness '' property of the region outside the black hole ,",
    "fix some outgoing null geodesic which intersects future null infinity and parallel translate a conjugate null vector ( i.e. a null vector in the other direction ) .",
    "the affine length of the null curves joining this null geodesic and @xmath29 , where the affine parameter is determined by the aforementioned vector , goes to @xmath30 .",
    "in particular , future null infinity can be thought to have infinite affine length .",
    "one says that the solution pocesses a `` past complete future null infinity '' or a complete domain of outer communications . 2 .",
    "the above spacetime is future inextendible as a @xmath28 metric .",
    "thus , according to the discussion in the introduction , this means that the schwarzschild solution is unique even in the class of very low regularity solutions .",
    "the significance of this fact will become clear later .",
    "at this point it should be noted that while the schwarzschild solution indeed provides intuition about black holes , it can not give insight as to whether these can occur in evolution of data where no trapped surfaces are present initially , i.e.  whether the kind of behavior outlined above is related in any way to the endstate of gravitational collapse . that properties 1 and 2 above are indeed general properties of solutions was proven by christodoulou  @xcite for the spherically - symmetric einstein scalar field equations : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 for generic solutions of the initial value problem , the penrose diagram obtained by christodoulou is as follows : @xmath34 in  @xcite , however , christodoulou explicitly constructs solutions with conformal diagram : @xmath35 these are so - called `` naked singularities '' .",
    "one might ask why should one consider the coupling with the scalar field . the natural case to consider first , it would seem , is the vacuum . a classical theorem of birkhoff , however , states that the only spherically symmetric vacuum solutions are schwarzschild .",
    "thus , matter _ must _ be included to give the problem enough dynamical degrees of freedom in spherical symmetry .",
    "the scalar field is in some sense the simplest , most natural choice .",
    ", etc  ]    as far as property 1 is concerned , christodoulou s results are the best evidence yet that this is indeed a property of `` realistic '' graviational collapse .",
    "it turns out however that there is another `` competing '' set of evidence that indicates that the behavior of christodoulou s solutions related to property 2 does not represent `` realistic collapse '' .",
    "( remember that property 2 is the central question for us , as this is what determines the notion of uniqueness . )",
    "this evidence is provided again by the intuition given by special solutions .",
    "one may consider the schwarzschild family of solutions as embedded in a larger , 2-parameter family of solutions called the _",
    "kerr solutions_. here the parameters are called mass and angular momentum , and schwarzschild corresponds to vanishing angular momentum . for all non - vanishing values of angular momentum ,",
    "the internal structure of the black hole is completely different , and , as we shall see momentarily , much more `` problematic '' , as property 2 will fail .",
    "thus the introduction of even an arbitrarily small amount of angular momentum  a phenomenon that can not be `` seen '' by spherically - symmetric models",
    " seems to change everything and cast doubt on the conclusions derived from the spherically symmetric einstein - scalar field model .    to summarize our `` unhappy '' situation",
    ", it seems that the phenomenon which plays a fundamental role in the issue we want to study is incompatible with the assumptions we have to make in order to render it mathematically tractable .",
    "it would seem that understanding the black hole region of realistic gravitational collapse using a spherically symmetric model is a lost cause .",
    "fortunately , there is a `` solution '' to this problem ! the effect of angular momentum on gravity turns out to be similar to the effect of charge .",
    "( as john wheeler puts it , charge is a poor man s angular momentum . ) indeed , there is a very close similarity between the conformal structure of the kerr family and a 2-parameter _ spherically symmetric _ family of solutions to the einstein - maxwell equations : @xmath36 @xmath37 @xmath38}=0,\\ ] ] @xmath39 the so - called _ reissner - nordstrm _ solution . here",
    "the parameters are mass @xmath20 and charge @xmath40 . for @xmath41",
    "one retrieves the schwarzschild family , while for @xmath42 one obtains : @xmath43 the @xmath19 singularity of the schwarzschild solution has disappeared ! the above spacetime is completely regular up to the edges .",
    "these new edges that `` complete '' the triangle , however , are at a _",
    "finite _ distance from the initial data , in the sense that all timelike geodesics joining those edges with the initial hypersurface have finite length .",
    "this solution thus has a regular future boundary and is extendible ( in @xmath44 ! ) beyond it .",
    "what fails at the boundary of this maximal domain of development of initial data is thus not the regularity of the solution , but rather , global hyperbolicity .",
    "any extension of @xmath12 will contain past inextendible causal geodesics not intersecting the intial hypersurface : @xmath45 points in such an extension but not in @xmath12 itself can not be determined by initial data , in the exact same way that the solution to a linear wave equation @xmath46 at the point @xmath47 depicted below , can not be uniquely determined by its values in the shaded set @xmath48 : @xmath49 what has happened in the reissner - nordstrm solution is that the situation depicted above developed , but from an @xmath48 that was complete .",
    "the physical interpretation of the above situation is that the classical principle of determinism fails , but without any sort of loss in regularity that would indicate that the domain of the classical theory has been exited .",
    "it is in that sense that this kind of behavior is widely considered by physicists to be problematic . on the other hand , numerical calculations ( penrose and simpson  @xcite ) on the behavior of linear equations on a reissner - nordstrm background indicate that a naturally defined derivative blows up at the cauchy horizon .",
    "this was termed the blue - shift effect .",
    "thus , penrose argued , the pathological behavior of the reissner - nordstrm solution might be unstable to perturbation . this led him to conjecture , more generally , _ strong cosmic censorship _ for generic initial data , in an appropriate class , the maximal domain of development is inextendible . in view of our discussion in the introduction , this can be thought of as the conjecture that , for generic initial data , the solution is unique wherever it can be defined . of course",
    ", the context in which this should be applied to ( i.e.  what equations , what class of initial data should be considered , etc  ) and the notion of extendibility are left open .",
    "we will comment more on that later .",
    "it might seem at first that the proper setting for discussing the problem of whether cauchy horizons arise in evolution , for generic data in spherical symmetry , is the einstein - maxwell equations .",
    "unfortunately , these suffer in fact from the same drawback as the einstein vacuum equations , namely they do not possess the required dynamical degrees of freedom .",
    "one necessarily has to include more matter , and again the simplest choice , as in the work of christodoulou , is a scalar field .",
    "thus one is easily led to the coupled einstein - maxwell - scalar field system :    @xmath50 @xmath37 @xmath38}=0,\\ ] ] @xmath32 @xmath51 @xmath52 it turns out that in spherical symmetry the maxwell part of the equation decouples . since the scalar field @xmath53 carries no charge , a non - trivial maxwell field",
    "can only be present if an initial complete spacelike hypersurface has non - trivial topology .",
    "in particular , this model is not suitable for considering the formation of black holes , as in the work of christodoulou .",
    "thus we will consider the problem where there is already a black hole present initially . to take the simplest possible formulation that captures the essense of the problem at hand",
    ", one can prescribe initial data for the system on two null rays , such that one corresponds to the event horizon of a reissner - nordstrm solution , and the other carries `` arbitrary '' matching data : @xmath54 to make the most of the method of characteristics , we introduce null coordinates , i.e.  coordinates @xmath55 such that the metric on @xmath12 takes the form @xmath56 . here",
    "we select the @xmath57-axis to be the event horizon , and the @xmath58 axis to be the conjugate ray on which we presribe our data .",
    "the unknowns are then just @xmath18 , @xmath59 and @xmath53 , and the electromagnetic part contributes a constant @xmath60 which is computed from the initial data .",
    "to write the equations as a first order system , we define @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and also @xmath65 , what one can call the `` renormalized '' hawking mass is defined to be @xmath66 .",
    "the renormalized version has the property that it is constant in the reissner - nordsrm solution and coincides with @xmath20 at future null infinity .",
    "] , defined by @xmath67 we then have : @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 @xmath73 @xmath74",
    "we can now state the theorems of  @xcite . on the one hand we have :    after restricting the range of the @xmath58 coordinate , the penrose diagram of the solution of the i.v.p .",
    "described above is as follows : @xmath75 moreover , @xmath18 extends to a function on the cauchy horizon with the property @xmath76 as @xmath77 ( where @xmath78 is the constant value of @xmath65 on the initial _ event _ horizon ) , and the metric can be continuously extended globally across the cauchy horizon .",
    "on the other hand , we have :    for `` generic '' initial data in the class of allowed initial data , @xmath65 blows up identically on the cauchy horizon .",
    "in particular , the solution is inextendible across the cauchy horizon as a @xmath79 metric .",
    "thus , strong cosmic censorship is true , according to theorem 2 , if formulated with respect to extendibility in @xmath79 or higher , but false , according to theorem 1 , if formulated with respect to extendibility in @xmath28 ( see  @xcite for reasons why one might want to require @xmath28 . ) in any case , the formation of a null `` weak '' singularity indicates a qualitatively different picture of the internal structure of the black hole from any of the previous models described above , and from the original expectations of penrose .",
    "the scenario of theorems 1 and 2 was first suggested by israel and poisson  @xcite who put forth some heuristic arguments .",
    "subsequently , a large class of numerics was done for precisely the equations considered here ( see  @xcite for a survey ) .",
    "because of the blow - up in the mass , this phenomenon was termed `` mass inflation '' .",
    "it should be noted that the imposition of reissner - nordstrm data on the event horizon is somewhat unnatural if the data is viewed as having arisen from generic data for a characteristic value problem where the @xmath57-axis is in the domain of outer communications .",
    "similar results to the above theorems , however , can in fact be proven for a wide class of data which includes the kind conjectured to arise from the aforementioned problem .",
    "these results will appear in  @xcite .",
    "the relavence of such an extension will only become clear , however , if the problem of determining the correct `` generic '' decay on the event horizon is mathematically resolved .",
    "our initial data are trapped , i.e.  @xmath80 and @xmath81 are both nonpositive .",
    "these signs are then preserved in evolution .",
    "note that from the equation @xmath82 it follows that @xmath83 is non - increasing in @xmath58 .",
    "what gives the analysis of our equations _ in the black hole region _",
    "its characteristic flavor is the fact that @xmath84 is potentially infinite when integrated for constant @xmath58 along the whole range of @xmath57 ( it is indeed infinite in initial data , i.e.  @xmath85 ) , and that this infinity can appear in the equations ( for instance in @xmath86 ) with either a positive or negative sign , depending on the sign of @xmath87 .",
    "note that , by contrast , in the domain of outer communications , this infinity is killed by the @xmath88 term since @xmath89 on outgoing rays . in the domain of development of our initial data , @xmath18 is bounded above by its initial constant value on the event horizon @xmath90 , in view of the signs of @xmath81 and @xmath80 .    in the reissner - nordstrm solution",
    ", the sign of @xmath87 goes from negative near the event horizon to positive near the cauchy horizon , while @xmath91 remains constant in @xmath58 and thus infinite , accounting for both what is called the infinite red shift near the event horizon ( this makes objects crossing the event horizon slowly disappear to outside observers as they are shifted to the red ) and the infinite blue shift near the cauchy horizon ( this accounts for the instability of the cauchy horizon to _ linear _ perturbations ) .    for general solutions of the initial value problem , some of these features of the sign of @xmath87 turn out to be stable , while others do not .",
    "in particular , theorems 1 and 2 together imply that the sign must become negative near the cauchy horizon , and not positive ! to attack this initial value problem ,",
    "it is clear that the behavior of this sign is the first thing that must be understood .",
    "it turns out that before the effects of the linear instability start to play a role , three geometrically distinct regions develop in evolution , a red - shift , no - shift , and stable blue - shift region , characterized by @xmath92 respectively : @xmath93 in the red - shift region , @xmath84 is unbounded as @xmath77 , but it appears with a `` favorable '' sign ( favorable as far as controlling @xmath65 is concerned bigger , and there is an extra @xmath80 on the denominator of @xmath94 . ] ) , in the no - shift region , @xmath95 is uniformly bounded , and in the stable blue - shift region , @xmath84 grows with @xmath58 but at a rate `` less '' than the growth of certain natural derivative of @xmath53 .",
    "these facts allow us to control all quantities reasonably well up until the future boundary of the stable blue - shift region , though completely different arguments must be applied to each subsequent region as it develops in evolution from the previous one .",
    "of course , all this work seems only to have pushed forward the problem from the original initial segments to the future boundary of the `` stable blue - shift region '' .",
    "but in fact our new `` initial '' conditions on the future boundary of the stable blue - shift region are much more favorable .",
    "the stable blue - shift region that has preceded it ensures that @xmath80 has a sufficiently fast decay rate in @xmath58 .",
    "( remember that blue - shift regions tend to make @xmath96 smaller , so they are favorable for controlling @xmath18 , but unfavorable for controlling @xmath65 . )",
    "once this rate can be shown to be preserved , it follows by integrating @xmath58 that one can bound @xmath18 _ a priori _ away from @xmath97 in its future , and thus prove the existence of the solution up to the cauchy horizon .",
    "it is clear from what we have said above that if the unstable region remains a blue - shift region ( see left diagram below ) , there is no problem .",
    "( this is of course what happens for the reissner - nordsrm solution itself . )",
    "@xmath98 the danger is if a new red - shift region develops ( see right diagram above ) .",
    "it turns out , however , that a new _ a priori _",
    "estimate @xmath99 is available in this case , which is independent of the size of @xmath65 .",
    "this makes use of the fact that there is a @xmath65 hidden also in the denominator in @xmath100 .",
    "( the estimate depends , however , on our knowledge of the new initial condition of @xmath18 and a particular bootstrap assumption on its future behavior ; in particular this estimate does not hold in the original `` red - shift '' region . )",
    "this is the last element in the proof of theorem 1 .",
    "we now discuss the proof of theorem 2 .",
    "as has been noted , at the level of perturbation theory  @xcite , one does see an instability , caused by the blue - shift region .",
    "( requiring some derivative of the scalar field to be positive initially , @xmath101 will decay in @xmath58 , and thus @xmath102 will decay in @xmath57 , at a slower rate than the decay of @xmath81 in @xmath57 , so that the natural derivative @xmath103 . ) on the other hand , the non - linearity tends to diminish this effect , since if the mass indeed increases , in view of theorem 1 , we have a reappearance of a red - shift region ( see diagram on the right above ) .",
    "as remarked earlier , this tends to make @xmath96 ( and also @xmath104 ) bigger , and thus @xmath105 smaller .",
    "the proof must thus encorporate something beyond `` linear theory arguments '' .",
    "this extra ingredient is supplied by a very powerful monotonicity peculiar to black hole interiors , or more specifically , to `` trapped regions '' .",
    "integration of @xmath106 and @xmath107 then implies that if @xmath102 and @xmath101 are initially of the same signs coordinate .",
    "this condition and the non - vanishing of a particular derivative of @xmath53 at the origin together define the `` generic '' class of initial data to which theorem 2 applies .",
    "] , let s say non - negative , then they remain non - negative , and in fact @xmath108 and @xmath109 . now",
    "integration of @xmath110 and using that @xmath111 is also non - increasing in @xmath58 , yields that for @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 it should be mentioned that in view of the sign of @xmath81 , both sides of the above inequality are positive .",
    "the broad outline of the proof of theorem 2 is as follows : first assume that the spacetime looks very much like reissner - nordstrm .",
    "then the linear theory more or less applies , and applying the bounds for @xmath102 in the equation @xmath110 , one obtains @xmath115 , which is a contradiction .",
    "thus one is reduced to proving that any spacetime `` quantitatively different '' from reissner - nordstrm must have @xmath115 .",
    "it is not possible here to explain precisely what `` quantitatively different '' has to mean . to give a taste of the kind of arguments involved in this `` non - linear part '' of the proof , we will be content to show that assuming only that @xmath65 is bounded below by a positive number plus its reissner - nordstrm value ( this is indeed a quantitative difference ) @xmath116 it follows from @xmath117 that @xmath65 must in fact blow up identically on the cauchy horizon",
    ". if @xmath118 is the future boundary of the stable blue - shift region , the fact that @xmath119 implies that given any @xmath120 , a sequence of points @xmath121 can be constructed so that the mass differences @xmath122 are all greater than @xmath123 : @xmath124 but in view of @xmath117 , this mass difference can be added on @xmath125 to yield infinite mass at the point where @xmath125 meets the cauchy horizon .",
    "suffice it to say that the non - linear analysis of black hole regions is quite different than the analysis we are used to .",
