    "high - voltage vacuum diodes of various configurations have been used widely for generation of high - power electron and ion beams . in these diodes , electric fields up to 10 mv / cm , magnetic fields of several tesla , and electron and ion current densities of ka/@xmath0 are produced .",
    "dense , not fully ionized plasmas are generally produced at electrode surfaces , either intentionally , as ion or electron sources , or unavoidably , by explosive emission processes .",
    "the resulting dynamics of plasmas and accelerated particles in these diodes require noninvasive temporally ( ns ) and spatially ( @xmath1 mm ) resolved diagnostics .",
    "the single most criticle quantity for understanding of diode gap processes is probably the electric field , but magnetic field , charge particle orbits , and plasma motion incuding charge - exchange and ionization of neutrals are also of great importance .    in typical high power ion diode configurations",
    "it is highly beneficial to use spectroscopic methods for measurements .",
    "y.maron _ et al . _",
    "@xcite used a spectroscopic technique for the first direct measurements of the electric field distribution in a magnetically - insulated ion diode .",
    "they measured the stark shift of spectral lines of doubly - ionized aluminum ions as they crossed a diode gap .",
    "this method can be applied only to ion diodes with specially selected ion composition . moreover ,",
    "its sensitivity is rather low due to the characteristics of electron transitions in heavy ions . in particular , the precision of the measurements in the above - cited work was 0.4 mv / cm .",
    "recently , similar experiments were carried out in the ion diode of the pbfa - ii accelerator @xcite . the stark shift of the _ 3p _ level of lithium in electric field up to 10 mv / cm was determined in these measurements without resonance laser excitation of atoms , but with self - injection of probe `` charge - exchange '' atoms from the partially ionized anode plasma layer into the diode gap .",
    "the probe atoms were produced because of the absence of a dense plasma layer with zero electic field near the anode in these experimets .",
    "they provide the first detailed investigation of ion diode acceleration gap physics in the high power pulses , and the first observations of stark shifts in a 10 mv / cm field .",
    "though the diagnostic methods used for electric field measurements in ion diodes so far have been successful , they are not generally applicable",
    ". they can not be applied , for example , to a proton - beam accelerator , nor could they be used in a lithium - beam accelerator with a dense , fully - ionized anode plasma .",
    "furthermore , both of this techniques can provide measurements only along a line of sight , not at a `` point '' . in ref .",
    "@xcite a method for measurement of the electric field in diodes using probe atoms injected into the gap and excited by resonant laser radiation was described . in this technique , called active stark atomic spectroscopy ( asas ) , the stark splitting of a probe - atom spectral line enables a calculation of the electric field with high time and space resolution . since the probe atom density is less than the density of the background gas , this technique would not disturb the diode",
    ". however , high sensitivity is provided by using resonant laser excitation to saturate the population of the upper level of transitions of interest . because one can easily distinguish signal from noise by simply omitting the probe beam or tuning lasers away from resonance with transitions , a reliable measurement can be made .    in ref .",
    "@xcite measurements of the electric field in the 6-cm diode gap of the u-1 electron - beam accelerator by the asas technique were briefly described .",
    "a lithium atomic probe beam was injected into the gap before the high - votage was applied .",
    "lithium levels with a principal quantum number @xmath2 were excited through cascade transitions using two dye - lasers .",
    "the bandwidth of the second laser was sufficiently wide to excite the split components of interest .",
    "spontaneous emission was recorded with 1 mm spatial resolution by a monochromator combined with a fiber - optic or electron - optic dissector ( see @xcite ) .",
    "these experiments enabled a direct measurement of the electric field strength at the definite point as a function of time in the diode during a 6-@xmath3s , @xmath41 mv voltage pulse .",
    "the electric field strength measured in these experiments was 200300 kv / cm , and the cathode and anode emission surfaces were located as a function of time .",
    "to apply the asas diagnostic method to ion - beam diodes , it is necessary to take into account the specific ion diode conditions , including a higher electric field strength and the presence of electron and ion flows in the gap . in this paper , we consider several experimental arrangements for measurements of the electric field by the asas technique with lithium and sodium .",
    "the selection of an atomic system , which can be used for stark - splitting measurements , depends upon : ( i ) the existance of data on stark - splitting as a function of the electric field , ( ii ) the availability of suitable lasers for a resonance transition , ( iii ) reasonable value of splitting in the expected range of the electric field , ( vi ) a low rate of field - ionization of the level .",
    "all these requirements are taken into account in the present paper .",
    "difficulties with the calculation of stark splitting in a strong electric field for atoms other than hydrogen - like , and the requirement of acceptable resonance transitions , suggest the alkali elements as probe atoms .",
    "another attractive atom is boron , because it can probably be excited with an intense krf - laser . in this section",
    "we will concentrate on li and na atoms only .",
    "we do not discuss in this paper the problem of loss of the probe atoms by field or impact ionization , because this has already been analysed in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite . in general",
    ", this is not a serious limitation .",
    "partial grotrian diagrams for lithium and sodium atoms are shown in fig.[levels ] , in which the levels that can be used in the experiments are presented .",
    "motivation for selection of these levels will be given in the next section .",
    "there is not much data on stark splitting for atoms in intense electric fields .",

    "the _ 4d _ and _ 4f",
    "_ levels of lithium differ only by @xmath56.8 @xmath6 .",

    "the _ 4d _ level can also be considered but it can be used for measurements only with an electric field strength below 1.5 mv / cm , because of field ionization .    since the lifetime of the _",
    "3p _ level is very short , this level must be excited during the accelerator pulse .",
    "this is possible with a wide bandwidth laser .",
    "spontaneous fluorescence from the _ 3p _ level then gives the shift of spectral line .",

    "an optical system with a narrow band filter gathers the fluorescence and gives an image of the fluorescing area on a frame camera .",
    "the filter selects a narrow bandwidth ( 1@xmath7210 nm ) of the light which corresponds to a definite electric field strength .",

    "a similar concept can be realized with `` matching '' method . instead of using a filter the `` matching '' method of excitation would used . a short - pulse laser beam irradiates the atomic slab .",

    "the electric field variation in the gap can be obtained from this picture .",

    "the effect of field ionization can also be observed .",
    "the choice of concrete scheme of realization of asas technique depends on the device where the diagnostics whould be applied and the goals of the experiment .",
