    "a class of chern - simons - matter theories provide a way of microscopically studying m2-branes and m - theory ( via gauge / gravity duality ) , as explored extensively in recent days after @xcite .",
    "the simplest model is perhaps the @xmath0 superconformal chern - simons - matter theory with @xmath3 gauge group and chern - simons level , which describes the dynamics of @xmath4 m2-branes probing @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "one of the key ingredients which makes the chern - simons - matter theory possible to describe m2-branes and m - theory is the magnetic monopole operators @xcite .",
    "firstly , such operators play crucial roles in providing the correct spectrum of local operators to account for the states in the dual gravity @xcite .",
    "monopole operators are also expected to play a central role in the supersymmetry enhancement from @xmath0 to @xmath6 when the chern - simons level @xmath7 is @xmath8 or @xmath9 , as studied in @xcite from various viewpoints . in particular , it has been shown in @xcite that the spectrum of protected operators including monopoles perfectly matches with that of the gravity dual , including the cases with @xmath10 . since the gravity spectrum in the latter cases is tightly organized by @xmath6 supersymmetry , the agreement checked in @xcite provides a strong support of supersymmetry enhancement including monopoles .",
    "local operators in conformal field theories are in 1-to-1 correspondence to the states in the radially quantized theories .",
    "local operators in @xmath11 containing monopoles therefore map to states in @xmath12 with nonzero magnetic flux on @xmath13 . from the field theory perspective ,",
    "monopole operators are non - perturbative objects in its coupling constant @xmath14 . for large enough @xmath7 , it is therefore natural and technically feasible to study classical ` solitonic ' solutions on @xmath12 with nonzero monopole charges .    in this paper , we study classical monopoles in the radially quantized @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory preserving minimal number of supercharges ( 2 hermitian ) . with large @xmath7 , we can semi - classically quantize these solutions and study quantum aspects of the monopole operators which have been addressed by more indirect methods @xcite .",
    "monopole operators inserted at a point in 3 dimension create a magnetic flux in a @xmath15 subgroup of the gauge group , on a 2-sphere surrounding the insertion point . in the @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory ,",
    "the @xmath15 subgroup is chosen by specifying two diagonal matrices with integer entries , @xmath16 where the entries can be ordered to be non - increasing @xmath17 , @xmath18 using the weyl group . from the structure of this theory ,",
    "these fluxes are subject to the constraint @xmath19 .",
    "these integers ( partly ) specify the boundary behaviors of the gauge fields around the point at which the monopole operator is inserted : @xmath20 where @xmath21 are the @xmath22 field strengths . as we shall explain in this paper , the field strengths @xmath23 and @xmath24 do not have to be ( and in certain cases , can not be ) uniform on the 2-sphere .",
    "monopole operators with magnetic charges satisfying @xmath25 have been studied quite extensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "this type of monopole operators is important in that they support gauge invariant chiral operators , whose scale dimensions are given by their r - charges .",
    "a detailed semi - classical study of such monopole operators for large @xmath7 has been done in @xcite . in particular , the semi - classical solutions corresponding to the chiral operators are fairly simple .",
    "this is because one only has to excite the s - waves of the scalar matters on @xmath13 , and the excited matters always come in the diagonal form .",
    "the excitations around such semiclassical solutions have been studied in detail in @xcite , from which ( the index version of ) the partition function for these states @xcite was calculated in a direct way @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that general type of monopole operators with @xmath26 should also exist .",
    "most importantly , they are required to have the large @xmath4 spectrum of the protected operators agree with that of the gravity states @xcite .",
    "such monopoles have also been studied in @xcite . however , a direct understanding of such monopole operators from the chern - simons - matter theory is lacking .    in this paper , we provide an ` honest construction ' of classical monopole solutions with @xmath27 by constructing their classical solutions .",
    "while chiral operators preserve at least @xmath28 real supercharges , the solutions with @xmath27 generically preserve @xmath9 real supercharges , which makes the structure of the classical solutions more delicate than the former ones .",
    "for instance , monopole operators with @xmath29 always come with nonzero angular momentum @xcite , which makes the classical solutions to carry nontrivial angular dependence on @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , contrary to the monopoles studied in the 3 dimensional sqed @xcite or in chern - simons - matter theories for chiral operators @xcite , ground state solutions for chern - simons monopoles with @xmath30 carry non - uniform magnetic flux on @xmath13 due to the backreaction of matters not in s - waves .",
    "we shall mostly restrict our studies to the monopoles in the @xmath2 theory , although some special solutions for the @xmath22 group will also be presented .    another interesting subject is the degeneracy of ground states for given set of monopole charges @xmath31 . for @xmath25 ,",
    "the degeneracy is determined by the study of chiral rings with monopole operators @xcite . from the viewpoint of classical solutions ,",
    "this is obtained by quantizing the classical moduli space of the solution @xcite .",
    "the data on the ground state degeneracy for monopoles with @xmath29 is encoded in the index of @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explicitly obtain the ground state degeneracies for various magnetic charges by quantizing our classical solutions . for the case with @xmath32 , @xmath33 ,",
    "namely when one of the @xmath2 fluxes is zero , we find that the ground state degeneracy calculated from our solution completely agrees with the result from the index , implying that our classical solution is most general .",
    ", @xmath34 are diagonal matrices , we shall often write them simply as integer sequences for brevity . ] on the other hand , for general @xmath2 magnetic charges , the degeneracy obtained from our solution is smaller than that obtained from the index .",
    "this implies that a more general ansatz than ours is necessary for the most general solution . see section 2 for the form of our ansatz , and conclusion as well .",
    "the remaining part of this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 , we summarize the aspects of monopole operators found in @xcite that we would like to understand more directly . in particular , we explain the spectrum and ground state degeneracies of monopole operators with various magnetic charges . in section 3 , we construct classical solutions for monopole operators with @xmath30 starting from an ansatz .",
    "the monopoles with @xmath35 gauge group are considered first in section 3.1 as they exhibit relatively simple behaviors , which is then extended to the general @xmath2 fluxes in section 3.2 . in all cases ,",
    "we find a set of ordinary differential equations , whose solutions are obtained numerically .",
    "we also semi - classically quantize the moduli of the solutions , obtain the ground state degeneracies and compare with the results of section 2 .",
    "some special solutions for larger gauge groups are also presented in section 3.3 .",
    "section 4 concludes with discussions .",
    "appendix a explains the monopole solutions in a simple @xmath15 chern - simons - matter theory , to illustrate that the type of solutions we study in this paper is common in all chern - simons - matter theories .",
    "the index for local gauge invariant operators preserving a particular set of @xmath9 real supercharges ( or one complex and its conjugate ) in the @xmath0 superconformal chern - simons - matter theories was computed in @xcite . as one takes the cartans of the @xmath36 r - symmetry to be three @xmath15 s which rotate the three ` orthogonal 2-planes , ' the chosen supercharge is charged under one of them which we call @xmath37 , while being neutral under the other two .",
    "let us denote the latter two charges by @xmath38 , which are cartans of @xmath39 .",
    "the index takes the form of @xcite @xmath40\\ , \\ ] ] where the trace is taken over the space of local gauge invariant operators , @xmath23 is the fermion number of the local operators , @xmath41 is the scale dimension ( or the energy of states in the radially quantized theory ) , @xmath42 is the cartan of the @xmath43 angular momentum on @xmath11 .",
    "this index counts the local operators whose dimensions saturate the bps bound @xmath44 .",
    "an integral expression of this index was obtained in @xcite .",
    "the index acquires contribution from sectors with various magnetic monopole charges @xmath31 of the form ( [ monopole - charge ] ) .",
    "one of the main interests in this paper is to study local operators with smallest scale dimensions for given magnetic charges : in other words , we are interested in the ` ground states . '",
    "therefore , let us explain the reduction of the index which contains information on the ground state spectrum and degeneracy for given monopole charge .",
    "the relevant expression is given by @xmath45\\!e^{ik\\sum_{i=1}^n(n_i\\alpha_i    \\!-\\!\\tilde{n}_i\\tilde\\alpha_i ) }    \\frac{\\prod_{i\\neq j}(1\\!-\\!x^{|n_i\\!-\\!n_j|}e^{-i(\\alpha_i\\!-\\!\\alpha_j ) } )    ( 1\\!-\\!x^{|\\tilde{n}_i\\!-\\!\\tilde{n}_j|}e^{-i(\\tilde\\alpha_i\\!-\\!\\tilde\\alpha_j ) } ) }    { \\prod_{i , j}(1\\!-\\!rx^{\\frac{1}{2}\\!+\\!|n_i\\!-\\!\\tilde{n}_j| }    e^{-i(\\alpha_i\\!-\\!\\tilde\\alpha_j)})(1\\!-\\!r^{-1}x^{\\frac{1}{2}\\!+\\!|n_i\\!-\\!\\tilde{n}_j| }    e^{-i(\\alpha_i\\!-\\!\\tilde\\alpha_j)})}\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath46 is for the cartan of one factor of @xmath47 in @xmath48 .",
    "another combination @xmath49 of @xmath50 chemical potentials does not appear for the ground states , as the ground states are neutral under it .",
    "let us provide more explanations on this expression .",
    "@xmath51 is the ` zero point energy , ' or more precisely @xmath52 , of monopole operators .",
    "the symmetry factor on the right hand side is determined by the weyl group of the subgroup of @xmath22 unbroken by the monopole charges : see @xcite for the details .",
    "the @xmath53 variables @xmath54 are all integrated from @xmath55 to @xmath56 .",
    "the @xmath57 factors in the denominators of the last factor come from exciting two anti - bifundamental scalars in the @xmath58 matrices .",
    "finally , let us explain how to understand ( [ index ] ) as an expression counting the ground states .",
    "the last product expression on the right hand side comes from the multi - particle exponential ( or the so - called ` plethystic ' exponential ) of the ` letter index . '",
    "we have reduced the general letter indices to those carrying minimal number of @xmath59 factors , which suffices for studying ground states .",
    "however , after carrying out the integration in ( [ index ] ) , there still appear various terms with different powers of @xmath59 .",
    "the expression ( [ index ] ) is to be understood as the collection of terms with minimal power of @xmath59 .",
    "see the treatments below in this section for some details .",
    "we mainly study the ground state degeneracy of monopoles with @xmath2 gauge group . in this case , the monopole charges are given by @xmath60 and @xmath33 , which are subject to @xmath61 .",
    "the last condition comes from the fact that an overall @xmath15 in @xmath22 decouples from the matters , constraining a component of the magnetic field to be zero via gauss law @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider the case in which all fluxes are nonnegative .",
    "the nature of the degeneracy depends on whether any two integers in this entry are equal or not .",
    "it turns out that the study can be divided into three different cases as we explain now .    in the ` generic ' case ,",
    "all four integers in @xmath62 , @xmath34 are different .",
    "it is sufficient to study the case with @xmath63 , as other cases with different orderings can be studied similarly .",
    "the lowest energy state can be obtained as follows .",
    "the phase @xmath64 in the integrand of ( [ index ] ) has to be canceled by the phases in the last factor in ( [ index ] ) , after geometrically expanding the denominator , to have nonzero term after integration . in the last factor ,",
    "every factor of phase is associated with an energy cost , i.e. comes with a positive power of @xmath59 . to get the ground state index ,",
    "we should consider cases minimizing this energy cost .",
    "let us temporarily ignore the factors in the numerator , to simplify the discussion , which shall be restored shortly .",
    "it turns out that , to minimize the energy , one should first take @xmath65 factors of @xmath66 to cancel the @xmath67 phase in ( [ phase ] ) .",
    "this is because the phase @xmath66 is associated with an energy cost @xmath68 ( i.e. coming with a factor of @xmath69 ) , which is smaller than the cost @xmath70 that is caused by using the phase @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , all @xmath72 phases should be canceled by taking @xmath73 factors of @xmath74 since it has lower energy cost than using the phase @xmath71 .",
    "one is therefore left with yet uncanceled phase @xmath75 where the last expression is obtained using @xmath61 .",
    "this phase should be canceled by taking @xmath76 factors of @xmath77 phases .",
    "the coefficient of @xmath78 after expanding the denominator is @xmath79 which is the @xmath47 character for a representation with dimension @xmath80 .",
    "of course the @xmath47 here is part of the @xmath36 r - symmetry . from the three group of phases above , one obtains @xmath81 after integration .",
    "the associated factor of @xmath59 is given by @xmath82 where we eliminated @xmath83 from the last expression .",
    "the exponent @xmath84 is the value of @xmath85 for the ground states with given monopole charges . in classical considerations in the large @xmath7 regime",
    ", we will consider the leading @xmath86 terms .",
    "in general , @xmath87 is all we can measure from the index .",
    "however , for the ground states , we can deduce the values of @xmath37 and @xmath42 separately by checking how many scalar letters are excited . by tracing back the integral that we have just done ,",
    "we find @xmath88 these charges will be reproduced from the classical solutions that we find in the next section .",
    "had there been no numerator factors in the last factor of ( [ index ] ) , the expression ( [ 1st - character ] ) would have been the degeneracy of the ground states .",
    "however , if we expand the following expression @xmath89 in the numerator , what we have computed in the previous paragraph is the contribution from the leading term @xmath8 .",
    "we now study other terms from the numerator .",
    "other terms all come with extra energy cost and also changes the number of some phases in ( [ phase ] ) . for such terms to contribute to the ground state , the phase changes should somehow provide an energy gain to compensate the energy cost . to start with ,",
    "let us consider the term @xmath90 in the numerator .",
    "compared to the analysis of the previous paragraph , the change of the phases is such that the number of required @xmath91 phase is increased by @xmath8 , while the number of required @xmath92 phase is decreased by @xmath8 .",
    "since the former phase comes with lower energy cost than the latter , there is an energy gain by @xmath93 , exactly canceling the cost shown in ( [ adjoint - cost ] ) .",
    "one can easily see that other terms in the numerator are ignorable as they always have net energy costs than ( [ generic - energy ] ) .",
    "so collecting all , one obtains @xmath94 where we used the following identity for the @xmath47 character : @xmath95 ( [ net - character ] ) is the final degeneracy formula for the ground states with ` generic ' monopole charges satisfying @xmath63 . strictly speaking , ( [ net - character ] )",
    "is an index and not the true degeneracy .",
    "but we suspect that the result ( [ net - character ] ) for the ground states could be the true degeneracy .",
    "a naive reasoning might be that , when obtaining the expression ( [ index ] ) from the general expression in @xcite , we have truncated all contributions from matter fermions due to the requirement that only lowest power terms in @xmath59 are kept in the letter indices .",
    "( fermions carry larger scale dimensions than scalars . ) also , in all cases that we can check with the semiclassical solutions within the range of our ansatz , we find that the degeneracy is either exactly the same as ( [ net - character ] ) or smaller ( implying that there are more general solution than what we find ) , but never larger than ( [ net - character ] ) .",
    "although the intermediate steps of our derivations above sometimes used @xmath96 , one can separately check that the final result ( [ net - character ] ) actually holds for the case with @xmath97 as well .",
    "the last case has been studied in detail in @xcite , together with a direct counting of the degeneracy ( [ net - character ] ) by quantizing classical solutions .",
    "we also comment that , while obtaining the above index for the generic @xmath2 monopole charges , the @xmath98 matrix elements of the matters (= scalars ) are all excited to saturate the gauss law ( from the fact that phases @xmath74 , @xmath77 , @xmath66 are used in the last factor of ( [ index ] ) to obtain ( [ net - character ] ) ) , while the @xmath99 component charged under @xmath100 is not excited .",
    "this is due to the requirement that we only count the ground states with given monopole charges .",
    "later , when we consider the semiclassical solutions with generic charges in section 3.2 , it should be remembered that the last component of the scalar should be turned off to obtain the lowest energy solutions .",
    "now we proceed to consider other ` non - generic ' fluxes in @xmath2 monopoles .",
    "the second case comes with one of the two pairs of fluxes in @xmath62 or @xmath34 being equal . again without losing generality , we can restrict our study to the case with @xmath101 .",
    "we start by noting that , since the flux does not break the second @xmath102 gauge group , there is a degeneracy between the energy costs in taking the two phases @xmath103 and @xmath104 from the denominator of the matter part in ( [ index ] ) .",
    "again , we ignore the numerators in the integrand for a while . calling @xmath105 , the phase ( [ phase ] )",
    "can be decomposed as @xmath106 for @xmath107 , and each of the four phases can be canceled by taking appropriate numbers of phases from the matters .",
    "the resulting index is given by @xmath108 to this expression , we should subtract various contributions coming from the numerator , which is given by @xmath109 in the last factor , we multiplied the symmetry factor @xmath110 in ( [ index ] ) . ) is the haar measure for the unbroken @xmath102 gauge group . ]",
    "the last factor can be effectively replaced by @xmath111 in the integral .",
    "one can show that the energy cost associated with the first two factors can never be compensated by an energy gain .",
    "therefore , we only need to consider the third factor .",
    "considering the second term in this factor , i.e. after multiplying the phase @xmath112 to the remaining part of the integrand , the total phase to be cancel by matters can be written as @xmath113 with @xmath107 , from which one obtains @xmath114 combining all , one obtains @xmath115 where we used the identity ( [ character - identity ] ) .",
    "note that the last ` character ' @xmath116 can come with negative argument , in which case the group theoretic interpretation becomes vague .",
    "however , the identity ( [ character - identity ] ) still holds with negative arguments with the definition of @xmath117 given by the first form in ( [ character ] ) . to manipulate the last expression ,",
    "note that the summation variable @xmath118 can be changed to @xmath119 .",
    "averaging over the two identical expression , and using @xmath120 , one obtains @xmath121 after expanding the remaining characters and appropriately reorganizing , one obtains @xmath122 we see that the first term on each line is a reduction of the index ( [ net - character ] ) in the generic case .",
    "therefore , with @xmath123 , there appears extra sectors in the ground states .",
    "we shall briefly discuss this point in the next section with our classical solutions .",
    "finally , the fluxes can come with @xmath124 . calling this integer @xmath125",
    ", one can show that the resulting index is @xmath126 this result is also obtained by quantizing classical solutions @xcite , as the fluxes satisfy @xmath25 .",
    "to summarize , the @xmath2 index is given by @xmath127 it is helpful to consider the simpler case with @xmath128 , as this case will turn out to be very simple from the semi - classical analysis .",
    "one finds @xmath129 which alludes to a contribution from one irreducible representation of global @xmath47 .",
    "we will show in section 3.1 that this degeneracy indeed comes from quantizing the classical moduli of the monopole solutions , generated by the global @xmath47 zero modes .",
    "although the @xmath2 monopoles are the main subject of this paper , one might wonder how the above degeneracy formula for the ground states would generalize for @xmath22 monopoles .",
    "as far as we can see , the generalization is not so straightforward and exhibits new features .",
    "for instance , we find that the ground state index for the @xmath130 monopoles depends sensitively on the order of the monopole charges @xmath131 , @xmath132 .",
    "we simply record one peculiar behavior that we find for certain monopole charges .",
    "namely , when the monopole charges satisfy the following conditions , @xmath133 we find that the index is zero for all @xmath7 . it would be quite curious to see if this implies that there are simply no states at this energy .",
    "in this section , we consider classical solutions for the monopoles in the @xmath0 chern - simons - matter theory preserving some supersymmetry . after explaining the basic setting , involving the details of the field theory on @xmath12",
    ", we explain the general equations for the bps monopoles that we are interested in .",
    "the details of the solutions for various monopole charges are considered in the following subsections .",
    "to study local operators preserving minimal number of supersymmetry , one starts by picking a complex supercharge among 12 poincare supercharges @xmath134 ( where @xmath135 , @xmath136 ) . without losing generality ,",
    "we pick @xmath137 as in @xcite . after radial quantization , to be explained in detail below , one can regard the conformal supercharges @xmath138 as hermitian conjugates of @xmath139 .",
    "the local operators , or states , that we are interested in are annihilated by @xmath140 and @xmath141 . from the algebra @xmath142 operators ( states ) annihilated by @xmath143",
    "satisfies the bps bound @xmath144 .",
    "the poincare supercharges @xmath145 define an @xmath146 subgroup of the full @xmath0 supersymmetry",
    ". it will be convenient to employ the @xmath146 superfield notations as in @xcite , which we do from now on .    in the @xmath146 supersymmetric formulation ,",
    "the matter fields can be decomposed to two bifundamental chiral supermultiplets @xmath147 and two anti - bifundamental chiral supermultiplets @xmath148 ( @xmath149 ) .",
    "in addition , there are @xmath22 vector multiplet @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "the adjoint scalars @xmath152 and fermions @xmath153 are composite fields which are quadratic in the matter fields . in particular , @xmath154 the action and supersymmetry transformation in our notation can be found in , say , @xcite .",
    "an aspect worth an explanation is the so - called ` baryon - like ' @xmath155 charge , which is the global part of the local @xmath15 gauge transformation associated with @xmath156 .",
    "the current of this symmetry is related by gauss law @xmath157    = \\frac{k}{2\\pi}{\\rm tr}\\left(\\star f_\\mu\\right)=\\frac{k}{2\\pi}{\\rm tr }    \\left(\\star \\tilde{f}_\\mu\\right)\\ ] ] to the magnetic flux of @xmath158 on @xmath13 .",
    "our convention is such that the last magnetic flux is positive when the fields @xmath159 and @xmath160 are excited .",
    "now we explain the radially quantized cft .",
    "conformal field theories can be defined in arbitrary conformally flat background . in particular , it is often useful to consider such theories on a spatial round sphere .",
    "the motivation for this setting is that @xmath161 is the boundary of global @xmath162 spacetime .",
    "we consider the chern - simons - matter theory living on a 2-sphere with unit radius .",
    "the metric on _ minkowskian _",
    "@xmath12 is @xmath163 where the overall radius is set to @xmath8 .",
    "a simple way of obtaining a cft living on the background ( [ metric ] ) from the cft on @xmath164 is called the radial quantization .",
    "we first consider a cft on euclidean @xmath11 , and relate the radial variable @xmath165 of @xmath11 ( around any point ) and the time @xmath166 of the cft living on _ euclidean _ @xmath12 as @xmath167 .",
    "the fields in the two euclidean theories are related as follows .",
    "firstly , abstractly denoting by @xmath168 the scalars in the former and latter theories , the two are related by @xmath169 where the exponent @xmath110 comes from the dimension of the scalar @xmath170 on @xmath11 .",
    "also , the gauge field @xmath171 as a 1-form on @xmath11 is simply taken to be the 1-form on @xmath12 @xmath172 with @xmath173 understood from the coordinate transformation . the relation between the fermionic fields of the two theories can be found in the appendix of @xcite . plugging all these field transformations into the action of the cft on @xmath11 , one obtains a cft action on euclidean @xmath12 . finally , a continuation @xmath174 ( with @xmath175 ) yields a cft on minkowskian @xmath12 , where @xmath176 is generated by @xmath177",
    ". an important feature of the last theory is that the scalars acquire conformal mass terms with masses given by @xmath178 .",
    "local operators inserted at a point ( @xmath179 in our explanation ) are in 1-to-1 correspondence with the states in the radially quantized theory .",
    "the scale dimension of operators map to the energy of the corresponding states .",
    "in particular , monopole operators create magnetic flux on spatial @xmath13 so that we are lead to study states propagating on @xmath12 in the presence of magnetic fields .    having the above field and coordinate transformations in mind , we shall freely go back and forth between the expressions on @xmath11 and @xmath180 in our analysis below .",
    "since we always take @xmath181 to be real , @xmath182 should be regarded as a phase in all analysis on @xmath11 .",
    "accordingly , the cartesian coordinates @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) of @xmath11 are not real but are subject to the following complex conjugation rule : @xmath185 .    for simplicity , we consider the monopoles with all integer fluxes @xmath186 , @xmath187 in ( [ monopole - charge ] ) being positive",
    ". with all fluxes being positive , the lowest energy states ( or the operators with lowest scale dimension ) for given monopole charges come in the sector in which only the gauge fields and the anti - bifundamental scalars @xmath188 are excited .",

    "namely , the existence of bps monopole operators with general @xmath539 magnetic charges @xmath540 , @xmath541 in @xmath22 were predicted in @xcite .",
    "while monopole operators with @xmath542 has been studied in various ways @xcite , those with @xmath27 have not been directly studied in the literature . now with our work in this paper , we can clearly see why the latter kind of operators were relatively harder to study more directly .",
    "monopole operators with @xmath542 in the context of m2-branes and ads / cft have been studied mostly in the context of chiral operators , which do not carry spatial spins .",

    "makes the latter non - uniform on @xmath13 .",

    "the dimension of the moduli space in our solution is smaller than what we expect for the most general solution .",
    "probably a genuine non - abelian ansatz for the gauge fields is necesary to understand the most general solutions . to understand this",
    ", it should be important to investigate general bps zero modes around our solution by studying small fluctuations .",
    "we leave this study to the future",
    ".    it would also be interesting to study possible relation to the vortex solitons in the mass - deformed chern - simons - matter theories . as",
    "monopole operators are vortex - creating operators , bps vortex solutions of @xcite in the mass - deformed theory on @xmath544 and our monopoles in the conformal theory on @xmath12 should be two special limits of vortex - like solitons of the mass - deformed theory on @xmath12 . perhaps this relation could provide a hint towards the zero mode structures of our monopoles from facts known for the vortices . note that the general study of bps vortices in mass - deformed theories also has been somewhat mysterious in that the true bps vacua have not been correctly identified . as this mystery has been resolved recently in @xcite , it should also be interesting to revisit the study of vortices and their roles in the gauge / gravity duality",
    ".    it will also be interesting to systematically study the ground state degeneracy of monopole operators with various magnetic fluxes .",
    "a reason why we feel this problem is interesting is the following . in the superconformal index of @xmath1 @xmath545 yang - mills theory",
    ", it has been shown that the large @xmath4 limit of the index is much smaller than the partition function ( or free energy , scaling like @xmath546 in the high temperature phase ) which we expect from the gravity dual @xcite .",
    "this is presumably due to a vast cancelation between the contrbution from bosonic and fermionic states to the index . now with various monopole sectors in chern - simons - matter theories , there exist the notion of ` many ground states ' for given monopole charges . as far as we have studied in various important sectors , these ground degeneracies from the index appear to be nonnegative and scale with a positive power of @xmath7 .",
    "for instance , the degeneracy from ( [ u(2)-index ] ) for the @xmath2 monopoles are quadratic in @xmath7 as the index is a multiplication of two characters .",
    "therefore , summing over various monopole sectors , in particular the ground states , there could be more nontrivial large @xmath4 scaling of the index free energy than 4 dimensional theories .",
    "especially , it should be interesting to see whether one can get the mysterious scaling @xmath547 .",
