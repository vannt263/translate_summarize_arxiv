    "in @xcite it has been noticed that the probability @xmath11 obtained for neutrinos at a fixed energy and baseline with input parameter ( @xmath12 ) , can be reproduced varying accordingly the values of @xmath10 and @xmath2 .",
    "considering at the same time the equiprobability curve for antineutrinos at the same energy and with the same input parameters , the two equiprobability curves have two intersections : the input pair ( @xmath12 ) and a second , energy dependent , point ( @xmath13 ) , the `` clone '' .",
    "this second intersection introduces an ambiguity in the measurement of the physical values of @xmath10 and @xmath2 ( the so - called ( @xmath14 ) ambiguity ) . in this case",
    "a fitting procedure to reconstruct the physical parameters will identify two low @xmath15 regions : one close to the input value and the other in the restricted area in which the other intersections are present ( a `` clone '' region ) .",
    "different proposals have been suggested to solve this ambiguity ( see @xcite for possible solutions to the problem using the combination of different baselines or detectors with improved energy resolution ) .",
    "we notice @xcite that muons proceeding from @xmath16 decay when @xmath16 s are produced via a @xmath0 transition ( the `` silver channel '' ) show a different @xmath17 correlation from those coming from @xmath1 ( the `` golden channel '' ) .",
    "this can be seen by looking at the equal - number - of - events ( ene ) curves , computed solving @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the number of `` wrong - sign '' muons produced in the detector in the i - th energy bin ( see fig.[fig : mudistr ] and @xcite for details ) .",
    "the different ( @xmath14 ) correlation between two channels comes from the different structure of the transition probabilities , which have an opposite sign in front of the cp - violating term . in principle",
    ", this different behaviour of the ene curves should reduce or eliminate the impact of the clone solutions when fitting simultaneously the two sets of data to reconstruct the physical parameters . to take full advantage from the `` silver '' channel",
    ", we should use a detector able to distinguish muons originated from @xmath16 decay from the `` golden '' muons .",
    "for this reason we consider an opera - like detector with a mass of 2 kton and spectrometers capable of muon charge identification ( see the opera proposal for details , @xcite ) located at @xmath20 km down the neutrino source .",
    "the improvement in the reconstruction of the physical parameters can be seen comparing the plots in fig.[fig : notau ] .",
    "on the left we consider two realistic iron detector ( including efficiencies and background as quoted in @xcite ) located at two different baselines @xmath20 km and @xmath21 km ( the optimal distance for the measurement of leptonic cp violation ) .",
    "the best fit point , obtained following the strategy presented in @xcite , is close to the input parameter ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) but a clone region is present and the determination of the physical parameters is affected by ambiguity . on the right plot , we show the results of the fit obtained combining at the same time both the `` golden '' and the `` silver '' channels at the ideal near emulsion detector and the `` golden '' channel at the magnetized iron detector located at @xmath21 km .",
    "the clone region completely disappears and the input parameters can be determined with an error of tens of degrees on @xmath2 and tenths of degrees on @xmath10 .       considering a realistic estimate of the reconstruction efficiency and of the main backgrounds both for `` golden '' and `` silver '' muon events at the emulsion detector @xcite , the clone regions for @xmath24 do appear and our results are comparable to those obtained with a combination of two realistic magnetized iron detectors located at @xmath20 km and @xmath21 km . however , at the time the neutrino factory will be operational , several improvement of the lead - emulsion detector could be done . in particular , we observed that a moderate scaling in the detector mass from 2 to 4 kton completely eliminates the clone regions for any value of @xmath25 . on the other hand ,",
    "a moderate increase in the main background rejection does not seem to improve in a significant way the previous results .",

    "<S> the recent sno results for solar neutrinos @xcite favour the lma - msw solution of the solar neutrino deficit with @xmath3 oscillations into active neutrino states with a large corresponding mixing angle ( @xmath9 ) .    by the end of the current decade , the @xmath10 angle could still be poorly known ( or even unknown ) and no information whatsoever will be at hand regarding the leptonic cp violating phase @xmath2 . for this reason it has been proposed to build the `` neutrino factory '' @xcite and suitably optimized detectors located far away from the neutrino source . </S>"
