    "in particular , we considered two kinds of mean fields using arithmetic average and geometric average , and found that the geometric mean field that counts large outliers less important was effective for controlling synchronization .    the controllable synchronization can be applied to understand the synchronization behavior of complex biological networks .",
    "interestingly , anti - symmetric couplings of three populations ( network 9 ) are realized in pancreatic islets  @xcite , and the synchronization between pancreatic islets is an important requirement in glucose metabolism  @xcite .",
