    "there is mounting evidence that the global population of ulxs is heterogenous , with the discovery of sources that show both spectral and temporal behaviour that does not obviously conform to that of the wider population ( see gladstone et al .",
    "2009 ; sutton , roberts & middleton 2013 ; middleton et al .",
    "2015a ) . notably amongst the outliers",
    "are m82 x-2 which shows pulsations in _ nustar _ data and identifies the compact object as a neutron star ( bachetti et al .",
    "2014 ) , and hlx-1 , the spectral evolution of which appears analogous to black hole binaries in outburst ( e.g. fender , belloni & gallo 2004 ) and has to - date provided the strongest evidence for an imbh ( m @xmath2 1000s m@xmath3 ) outside of dwarf agn ( farrell et al .",
    "2009 ; davis et al . 2011 ; servillat et al .",
    "2011 but see also king & lasota 2014 ; lasota et al .",
    "the remainder of the population are likely to contain stellar remnants with masses @xmath4100 m@xmath3 and , given their remarkable x - ray luminosities of @xmath2 1@xmath510@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 , provide strong evidence for the presence of super - critical accretion likely due to high mass transfer rates via roche lobe overflow ( rlo ) from a more massive companion star in a tight binary orbit ( see for example the case of ss433 : king et al . 2000 ; begelman , king & pringle , 2006 ) .",
    "the picture of ulxs as super - critical accretors has received a recent boost with a dynamical mass determination for one source ( motch et al .",
    "2014 ) , and the discovery of winds from two archetypal ulxs ( pinto , middleton & fabian 2016 , see also middleton et al .",
    "2014 ; 2015b ) with outflow velocities of @xmath8 0.2c .",
    "the absorption features that indicate the presence of a mass - loaded outflow require that we view into the wind at least some of the time ( see middleton et al .",
    "2015b ) but the opening angle and homogeneity of the wind is still unknown and is important for constraining the impact of geometrical beaming ( king 2009 ) and the origin of variability ( heil et al .",
    "2009 ; middleton et al . 2011 ; 2015b ) .",
    "however , it is important to note that the apparent wind properties agree well with expectations for strongly supercritical accretion ( king & muldrew , 2016 ) .",
    "eclipses have been previously identified as a useful diagnostic of ulxs by pooley & rappaport ( 2005 ) and more recently by king & nixon ( 2016 ) ; where no eclipses are found on the recurrence timescales of hours to days , this would imply that a main - sequence to sub - giant secondary star does not transit the stellar mass source , whilst on recurrence timescales of months to years , the case for an imbh being eclipsed can be tested .",
    "the latter is still extremely difficult to demonstrate unambiguously due to the high cadence of observations required , however , the availability of x - ray lightcurves spanning hours to days is now available for many ulxs ( rosen et al .",
    "2015 ) allowing us to test the former , stellar - mass compact object scenario . here",
    "we place limits on the likely presence of eclipses in a large sample of ulxs using a large test range in binary separation and mass ratio , the mass limit placed by motch et al .",
    "of @xmath4 15 m@xmath3 and the impact that eclipses must have on the variability .",
    "whilst eclipses have not yet been conclusively detected in ulxs ( with one recent exception : urquhart & soria 2016 submitted ) - although dip like events have been seen in a number of sources ( stobbart , roberts & warwick 2004 ; grise et al .",
    "2013 ) - we can consider the impact that eclipses by an opaque body must have on the lightcurve of a given source for a range of system parameters",
    ". the summed variance resulting _ only _ from an eclipse of duration t@xmath9 occurring in an observation of length t@xmath10 by a passing opaque star of radius r@xmath11 projected as a perfect disc is :    @xmath12    or , in terms of fractional variability :    @xmath13    where @xmath14 is the mean count rate , x is the count rate out of eclipse ( in eclipse the count rate is assumed to be zero , i.e. the eclipse is of a point source ) and n is the number of eclipses occurring in a given observation ( i.e. t / t@xmath10 where t is the binary period ) .",
    "we have also assumed that the x - ray source is compact enough such that the duration of ingress and egress can be ignored .",
    "this formula can be simplified and re - arranged to :    @xmath15^{-1}\\right)\\ ] ]    these formulae make the implicit assumption that there are no timebins which straddle the ingress and egress - we will return to this assumption when discussing the real data (  3.1 ) .",
    "the eclipse duration is also a well understood function of the stellar radius ( @xmath16 ) , binary separation ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 and the inclination of the system ( @xmath19 , which is taken to be from the axis perpendicular to the binary system which we assume to be perfectly aligned : see king & nixon 2016 for a discussion on probable inclination evolution in ulxs ) :",
    "@xmath20    assuming stable rlo we can substitute for @xmath21 ( frank , king & raine 2002 ) using :    @xmath22    and    @xmath23^{3/2 } { \\rm days}\\ ] ]    using equation 3 we can determine the implied eclipse duration based on a _ measured _ fractional variability ; using this along with values for @xmath24 and @xmath18 determined from values for @xmath25 and @xmath17 we can then determine @xmath19 from a re - arranged equation 4 .",
    "if this value is smaller than cos@xmath26 then , by definition , no eclipses are possible .",
    "walton et al . ( 2011 ) combined the _",
    "xmm - newton _ 2xmm source catalogue with the rc3 ( de vaucouleurs et al . 1991 ) and karachentsev et al . (",
    "2004 ) nearby galaxy catalogues to identify a total of 470 ulx candidates in the local universe ( out to a distance of 148 mpc ) with a sky coverage of 504 square degrees , correcting for background contaminants . the latest incarnation of the _ xmm - newton _ source catalogue ( 3xmm - dr5 : rosen et al . 2015 )",
    "provides the excess fractional variability ( i.e. the poisson noise is subtracted ) from the 0.2 - 12  kev lightcurve determined using a bin - size ( @xmath27 ) corresponding to 18 ct / s across the entire duration of the observation ( minus intervals not defined by a gti and null bins ) .    by cross - matching 3xmm - dr5 with the walton et al .",
    "( 2011 ) ulx catalogue we have obtained all existing observations of the previously identified ulx candidates using _ xmm - newton _ which includes the observation length ( @xmath28 ) and fractional variability ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we restrict ourselves to use of the pn only , as typically the fractional rms will be better constrained as the poisson noise is lower due to higher detector throughput ( see vaughan et al .",
    "2003 ) ; we therefore exclude observations where the pn was not available and where the fractional variability was not determined - this left us with a total of 123 individual sources across 223 observations .    assuming the mass of the compact object to be @xmath415m@xmath3 and therefore consistent with the findings of motch et al .",
    "( 2014 ) , we can determine the fraction of sources where eclipses should not be possible , i.e. they meet the criterion :    @xmath30    we do this across a range in binary separation of 5@xmath510@xmath31 - 1@xmath510@xmath32 cm and for mass ratios of 0.25 - 5 .",
    "we place sensible constraints of @xmath33 0.01 days , @xmath34 and t@xmath10 @xmath2 t ; the first restriction comes from rough observational limits for binaries containing neutron stars and black holes , and the second implies that there is always a full bin in the eclipse with zero count / s . from equation 6",
    "it is clear that the number of observations fulfilling the third criterion varies as a function of binary separation and mass ratio but is typically gaussian ( @xmath35 20 observations ) except for large @xmath17 . in figure 1",
    "we plot the number of individual sources ( rather than observations which is naturally larger ) which meet our selection criteria and the number which also meet the criterion in equation 7 as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath17 .",
    "a notable caveat in this work is the assumption that the fractional variability ( equation 3 ) is not affected by bins which straddle the ingress and egress .",
    "this is highly idealised and in reality such occurrences will lower the effective rms introduced by the eclipse .",
    "we can however determine the likely impact such straddling can have by varying the sampling of the eclipse , i.e. by varying the relative fraction of the straddling bin which falls inside or outside of the eclipse we can determine , based on the binsize , eclipse duration and number of eclipses in a given observation length , the variance relative to the idealised case in equation 1 .",
    "we do this for all observations that meet the criteria discussed above and plot the mean fractional difference in variance as a function of @xmath25 and @xmath17 in figure 2 . in order to simplify the error determination",
    ", we assume only integer bins across the observation which is not what we assume in the previous section , thus the derived error is only approximate .",
    "as the mean count rate is unchanged by the sampling , the fractional error in the variance is a measure of the fractional error on @xmath36 in equation 3 .",
    "the result of our calculation indicates that at most we should expect an approximate error on the variance of @xmath4 20% , converting this to an error on the eclipse duration we find that @xmath37 $ ] so that the fractional error in the eclipse duration is always smaller than that in the variance estimate .",

    "( 2014 ) of @xmath4 15 m@xmath3 is representative for those sources which show ` ultraluminous ' spectra ( stobbart et al . 2006 ; gladstone et al . 2009 ; sutton et al . 2013 ) , then assuming material is transferred via rlo , the variability for the vast majority of the best available sample ( following our selection criteria ) is consistent with the lack of eclipses by a companion star ( in a fully aligned orbit ) . in the picture where a super - critical accretion rate leads to a large radiation pressure and an inflated disc ( e.g. shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; king 2001 , 2009 ; poutanen 2007 ; ohsuga & mineshige 2011 ; jiang et al .",
    "2014 ) , then the secondary star is expected to be fully obscured by the large scale - height inflow and radiatively driven wind ( h / r @xmath2 1 ) .",
    "this picture leads to a conical geometry where , in order to see the x - ray emission at all and define the source as a ulx , we must generally be viewing into the cone or through the wind where down - scattering does not entirely prevent some bright x - ray emission .",
    "the lack of large contributions to the variability via eclipses is therefore fully consistent with this picture and supports arguments built on spectral - variability properties ( sutton et al .",
    "2013 ; middleton et al .",
    "2015a ) , the detection of blue - shifted absorption features ( middleton et al . 2014",
    "; 2015b ; pinto et al . 2016 ) and implies that some level of geometrical beaming is likely ( probably only a factor of a few at most given the ionising luminosity incident upon nebulae surrounding some of the sources : pakull & mirioni 2003 ) .",
    "in this work we have assumed that the rms values are representative ( i.e. we have ignored the errors on the rms values ) ; whilst uncertainty on the rms can introduce a corresponding uncertainty on the derived inclination this is somewhat mitigated by the assumption that _ all _ the variability measured in a given observation comes from an eclipse which we know to be incorrect due to the observation of band - limited power spectra and rms - flux relationships ( e.g. heil et al . 2009 ; 2010 ) which implies that propagation of surface density fluctuations ( lyubarskii 1997 ; arevalo & uttley 2006 ; ingram & done 2011 ) is responsible for much of the variability ( see middleton et al .",
    "2015a for possible means to extract variability from super - critical flows ) . as a result ,",
    "the true variability imprinted by an eclipse could be considerably smaller than implied by the rms value we have used .",
    "our sample has not been selected based on spectral type nor luminosity ( except that the inferred _ isotropic _ luminosity has at some point reached or exceeded 1@xmath510@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 such that it has been identified as a ulx candidate : walton et al .",
    "a lack of explicit selection might present an issue as there is a clear dichotomy in the general population , with the fainter ulxs likely associated with more ` standard ' accretion in a hm or lmxb proceeding around the eddington limit ( e.g. middleton et al . 2011 ; 2012 ; 2013 ; soria et al . 2012 ) whilst the brighter sources are more likely associated with thermal timescale mass transfer proceeding at super - critical rates ( king 2001 ) .",
    "however , we _ have _ selected on variability , which is known to be a tracer of ulx ` type ' ( see sutton , roberts & middleton 2013 ; middleton et al .",
    "2015a ) with only the latter , super - critical candidates ( which are often the brighter sources but not always , see middleton et al",
    ". 2015a ) showing considerable fractional variability .    finally , an inescapable question that results from identifying ulxs as relatively low inclination sources is  where are the edge - on ulxs ? \" ; the answer is that the wind and the large - scale height disc will increasingly block the hard x - ray emission from the inner regions such that the sources become relatively x - ray faint e.g. ngc 55 ulx-1 ( middleton et al .",
    "2015a ) and may no longer appear above 1@xmath510@xmath6 erg s@xmath7 or even x - ray bright at all .",
    "instead , the photosphere we see to peak in the soft x - rays in ulxs may not be the photosphere we see at very high inclinations ( poutanen et al . 2007 ) and the x - ray emission incident onto the wind and disc will likely be reprocessed down to the uv ( depending on the density along the line - of - sight for compton scattering ) .",
    "we thank the referee for their useful suggestions and will alston for helpful discussion .",
