    "@xcite , assuming a zero anisotropy parameter and a single superconducting layer we get @xmath88 , where @xmath89 is a dimensionless parameter that enters the definition of ginzburg landau free energy functional @xcite , with @xmath90 being the cooper pair mass .",
    "it thus follows that the chemical potential of the 2d fluctuation cooper pairs reads : @xmath91 which constitutes a simple analytic expression with the peculiarity that it does not exhibit an explicit dependence on the number of fluctuation cooper pairs .",
    "the heat capacity at constant particle number is @xmath92 : @xmath93 since @xmath94 is the dominant term as @xmath4 approaches @xmath25 .",
    "the analogue to the thermal compressibility @xmath47 is : @xmath95",
    "so , the ratio @xmath46 explicitly reads : @xmath96      the thermoelastic coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath47 , and @xmath43 were given in ref .",
    "@xcite . for clarity",
    "we give the derivation steps for @xmath47 ; the other two follow similar steps . for a many - particle system with energy distribution function @xmath97 and density of state @xmath98 , the number of particles @xmath29 is given by :                for bosonic and fermionic systems in the normal phase ,",
    "the seebeck coefficient for the channel reads @xcite : @xmath103 , with the @xmath104 s being the kinetic coefficients computed from the kinetic integrals @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the transport distribution function of the channel , which for simplicity assumes the standard lorentzian shape .",
    "the seebeck coefficient may thus be seen as the average value of the entropy involved in the thermoelectric transport , @xmath107 , over a probability density function given by the product of the transmission function and the energy derivative of @xmath97 .",
    "note that in metals and degenerate semiconductors , as the electrons above the fermi level carry a heat current that is practically the opposite of that carried by the electrons below the fermi level , the seebeck coefficient is typically small ; in other words , from the mathematical viewpoint , since @xmath108 changes sign as @xmath109 varies , it is essential that @xmath110 presents an asymmetric profile  @xcite , to avoid cancellation of @xmath111 .",
    "it is easy to check numerically for bosonic and fermionic systems in their normal phase , that @xmath1 decreases and tends to 0 as the system s temperature keeps decreasing . turning to the fluctuation regime ,",
    "the general derivation of the seebeck coefficient for the two - dimensional fluctuation cooper pairs is much more involved  @xcite , but it yields @xmath112 as @xmath113 .",
    "quatrons are composite quasi - particles , formed of two electrons located in separated quantum wells but bound by an attractive effective coulomb interaction mediated by an exciton located in a third quantum well sandwiched between the other two . within an optical microcavity , quatron form quatron - polaritons ( qp )",
    "thanks to the coupling of the electronic excitations to the photonic modes of the cavity ; their effective mass is typically @xmath114 times smaller than that of free electrons . under some experimental conditions , in a suitably designed structure , a system of qp may undergo a superfluid phase transition near or at room temperature owing to the extremely light qp effective mass . if the quatrons form a working fluid , which is prepared near its phase transition , its thermodynamic figure of merit @xmath23 and its thermoelectric heat capacity ratio @xmath52 are given by eq .",
    "with the same @xmath67-dependence as for the standard cooper pairs .",

    "<S> thermoelectric energy conversion is a direct but low - efficiency process , which precludes the development of long - awaited wide - scale applications . as a breakthrough permitting a drastic performance increase </S>",
    "<S> is seemingly out of reach , we fully reconsider the problem of thermoelectric coupling enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> the corner stone of our approach is the observation that heat engines are particularly efficient when their operation involves a phase transition of their working fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we derive and compute the thermoelastic coefficients of various systems , including bose and fermi gases , and fluctuation cooper pairs . combination of these coefficients yields the definition of the thermodynamic figure of merit , the divergence of which at _ finite _ temperature indicates that conditions are fulfilled for the best possible use of the thermoelectric working fluid . </S>",
    "<S> here , this situation occurs in the fluctuation regime only , as a consequence of the increased compressibility of the working fluid near its phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> our results and analysis clearly show that efforts in the field of thermoelectricity can now be productively directed towards systems where electronic phase transitions are possible .    </S>",
    "<S> [ [ introduction - and - rationale ] ] introduction and rationale + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    thermoelectric phenomena in conductors emerge from the fundamental coupling between the energy and the electric charge that each mobile electron carries , and they manifest themselves as coupled transport of heat and electricity . in a thermodynamic picture , thermoelectric devices operating as generators or refrigerators , are heat engines where the conduction electrons act as the working fluid . hence </S>",
    "<S> , as it is purely electronic in nature , the thermoelectric conversion is a direct process , which is not system size - dependent and does not entail complex dissipative mechanisms owing to the absence moving parts . </S>",
    "<S> thermoelectric systems may thus present strong advantages over traditional heat engines but the energy conversion efficiency still is far too low to envisage wide - scale applications in the near future @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> interest in thermoelectricity has much varied since its early days in the 19th century @xcite , showing a particular surge concomitant of the fast progress in semiconductor physics in the 1950 s and 1960 s and the ensuing improvement of thermoelectric device performance , which is assessed against efficiency or coefficient of performance depending on the operating mode . </S>",
    "<S> it has become customary to relate either of these latter to the dimensionless figure of merit @xmath0 , which combines the materials transport coefficients , namely the seebeck coefficient @xmath1 , the electrical conductivity @xmath2 , the thermal conductivity @xmath3 , and the average temperature @xmath4 across the system @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath3 entails both electron and lattice thermal conductivities , @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the lorenz number . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath10 may be viewed as a quantitative measure of a system s relative ability to conduct heat with respect to its ability to conduct electrical charges . to envisage applications for thermoelectric systems other than those for which sustainability and reliability are more important than low - level efficiency and high cost , values of @xmath0 greater than 4 are mandatory @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although they were seen as very promising candidates for the development of thermoelectric applications , bulk semiconductors did not prove to be the long - awaited miracle materials : goldsmid@xcite anticipated that @xmath0 would not easily reach 1 , and that one could hardly hope that it will ever go beyond 2 . </S>",
    "<S> the 1990 s works of dresselhaus and co - workers on transport in low - dimensional thermoelectric systems @xcite inspired bandstructure engineering , particularly focused on the effective mass , as a way to increase @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> so far , these efforts have had limited success so attention turned to lowering @xmath7 since thermal energy transferred by phonons simply represents a useless heat leak . </S>",
    "<S> the paradigm in thermoelectric materials then became slack s </S>",
    "<S> so - called electron crystal - phonon glass system @xcite , which provided a strong impetus for the continued development of the field of thermoelectricity , which to date remains as active as ever @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> recent progress in materials science and nanostructure engineering @xcite essentially entails lowering of lattice heat conduction and enhancement of the seebeck coefficient of thermoelectric materials , but even `` promising '' materials do not , as of yet , boast the much sought - after minimal requirements , and they may also suffer from a variety of practical problems that preclude wide - scale applications @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> further , it has become obvious that , despite the tremendous progress in nanostructure engineering over the last twenty years , one can not lower the lattice thermal conductivity arbitrarily , and not even below a threshold that would permit obtainment of at least @xmath11 . knowing that the lorenz number is roughly the same across a wide range of metals , and that the transport coefficients may not vary drastically under standard working conditions , explain to some extent the difficulty to obtain @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> so we may turn to an aspect of thermoelectricity , which is always neglected : the thermodynamics of the electronic working fluid and its ability to transport entropy ; but this is not so simple since @xmath6 relates to two phenomena : heat transfer by conduction ( described by fourier s law ) and heat transfer by electron convection @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the former is constrained by the wiedemann - franz law , which applies for metals and degenerate semiconductors ; the latter represents the actual thermoelectric flux and hence it can only be seen as the `` useful '' contribution to heat transfer across the thermoelectric system submitted to a temperature bias .    enhancing the thermoelectric convective flux </S>",
    "<S> may be done by increasing the temperature difference across the system , but this is not a satisfactory solution : though loss through electronic thermal conduction may be largely compensated by the competing convective process , heat transfer by lattice conduction and hence inefficiency also increases . in a context very different from thermoelectricity , the analysis of the effects of phase transitions on mantle convection @xcite , showed that if the phase transition is exothermic , the release of latent heat enhances convection . </S>",
    "<S> in general , regimes where convection dominates the heat transfer process are characterized by high values of the prandtl number , @xmath13 , which may be simply defined as follows @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kinematic viscosity , @xmath16 is the thermal diffusivity , @xmath17 is the viscosity , @xmath18 is the density , and @xmath19 is the heat capacity at constant pressure of the considered fluid . in simple models the thermal conductivity is given by @xmath20 , so one sees that the prandtl number is proportional to the heat capacity ratio @xmath21 , also known as the isentropic expansion factor @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> the prandtl number thus provides a link between the thermodynamic properties of the fluid and its capacity for convective heat transfer .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we are interested in the properties of the thermoelectric working fluid whose specific study is always neglected in favour of the engine itself in a broad sense ( i.e. , materials , system configuration , structure ) . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the most profitable conditions for the convective thermoelectric transport are those which bring the working fluid near a phase transition . with the relevant thermoelastic coefficients , </S>",
    "<S> we define the figure of merit @xmath23 , which is the thermodynamic counterpart of @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> note that @xmath23 , as a property of the working fluid , does not contain the lattice term @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> clearly , we do not aim to propose at present an actual system boasting values of @xmath0 much greater than the highest ones achieved so far ; we primarily aim to show that efforts must concentrate on electronic systems that may undergo a phase transition for performance enhancement , and to provide also insight into the fundamental difficulty to increase @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we thus consider the regime where the so - called superconducting fluctuations @xcite above the critical temperature @xmath25 appear : while still in its normal phase , the electronic system boasts some particular effects , which pertain to the superconduting phase . indeed , with the presence of fluctuation cooper pairs , properties such as , e.g. , conductivity and heat capacity , increase significantly as the system approaches the critical point . </S>",
    "<S> fluctuation cooper pairs play a major rle in the thermoelectric properties of high-@xmath25 superconductors , in relation to their transverse thermoelectric response to an applied thermal gradient ( nernst signal ) which was theoretically predicted @xcite , and experimentally observed in amorphous films of nb@xmath26si@xmath27 @xcite and heavy - fermion superconductor uru@xmath28si@xmath28 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here , we specifically study the temperature - dependence of the thermoelectric coupling strength of two - dimensional ( 2d ) fluctuation cooper pairs , which we systematically compare to that of charged fermions and bosons in the normal phase .    [ [ thermodynamic - analysis ] ] thermodynamic analysis + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    consider a system , like a reservoir , composed of @xmath29 noninteracting charge carriers with a given statistics at thermal equilibrium at temperature @xmath4 . from the assumption of extensivity of the free energy , one obtains the gibbs - duhem relationship : @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the system s entropy and @xmath32 the chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> this equality shows that heat and electricity are coupled through the intensive variables @xmath32 and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> now , in analogy with the classical gas , using the correspondence : @xmath33 and @xmath34 , we define the following thermoelastic coefficients of the charge carriers as @xmath35 : analogue to thermal dilatation coefficient ; @xmath36 : analogue to isothermal compressibility ; @xmath37 : analogue to specific heat at constant pressure ; @xmath38 : analogue to specific heat at constant volume . using extended maxwell s relations , we find that @xmath39 with @xmath40 , which reflects the notion of entropy per particle introduced by callen @xcite and the ensuing thermodynamic definition of the thermoelectric coupling , @xmath41 , which simply shows that the considered particles carry an electric charge @xmath42 _ and _ energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the relationship between the heat capacities @xmath43 and @xmath44 is central in the present work : @xmath45 where @xmath46 is a quantity similar to the lorenz number @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note the relationship between @xmath47 and a capacitance in circuit theory : on the one hand the classical isothermal compressibility is a measure of the change in the system volume as the applied pressure changes ; now with the correspondence @xmath48 and @xmath49 , we obtain a measure of the ability of a capacitor to store electric charges under an applied voltage , so that @xmath50 is an electrical capacitance . therefore , while the lorenz number @xmath10 pertains to coupled transport , the ratio @xmath51 is a quantitative measure of a system s relative ability to store thermal energy with respect to its ability to store electrical charges . the ratio @xmath52 is analogous to the classical isentropic expansion factor @xmath22 , and may be used to define the thermodynamic figure of merit , @xmath23 , for the charged working fluid . </S>",
    "<S> if conditions are found for @xmath52 to reach high values or even diverge at _ finite _ temperature , the electronic working fluid may acquire properties , which could significantly facilitate entropy transport by convection . for a noninteracting many - particle system in the normal phase at equilibrium , the computation of the thermoelastic coefficients @xmath53 , @xmath47 , and @xmath43 is straightforward ( see the appendix ) . </S>",
    "<S> but , the fluctuation regime necessitates a particular approach  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> calculations detailed in the appendix yield the chemical potential of the 2d fluctuation cooper pairs : @xmath54 where @xmath55 with @xmath25 being the critical temperature , @xmath56 is a dimensionless parameter that enters the definition of the ginzburg - landau free energy functional @xcite , and @xmath57 is the boltzmann constant . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy per particle @xmath58 is given by the expression @xmath59 :  @xcite @xmath60 and the heat capacity ratio reads : @xmath61 it is positive and exhibits a logarithmically divergent behaviour as @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> it has a universal character for 2d systems that may be described as fluctuation cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> the divergent behaviour of @xmath52 contrasts with the standard textbook cases of the ratio @xmath21 for classical and quantum gases in the normal phase for which the isentropic expansion factors remain finite at finite temperatures , in each case @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> in fact , both @xmath1 , which is the degree of mutual interaction at the local level between two irreversible processes @xcite , and @xmath58 , which is the average at the macroscopic level of the system s entropy distributed over its constituents @xcite , combine and permit the thermoelectric transport . more precisely , if one considers a simple setup made of two reservoirs and a conducting channel @xcite , it is easy to show @xcite that the effective thermoelectric coupling @xmath65 , combines the thermodynamic properties of the reservoirs through @xmath58 with those of the channel through @xmath1 , as @xmath66 . as noted in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the effective thermoelectric coupling characterizes two processes : the transport of entropy through the channel as a response to an external constraint ( see the appendix ) , and the production of entropy as one charge is released from one reservoir and is absorbed by the other .    </S>",

    "<S> , we adopt the same notations for all the considered systems , and more importantly we base our discussion on the temperature- or equivalently , the @xmath67-dependence of @xmath23 and @xmath52 . the 2d fermi and bose systems do not undergo a phase transition , while the 3d bose gas does at the condensation temperature @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this permits the definition of a common parameter @xmath69 for the joint analysis of the bose gases and the fermi gas ; to account for the fluctuation cooper pairs with a critical temperature @xmath25 different from @xmath68 , we use the same scale as for the three other systems .     and thermodynamic figure of merit @xmath23 as functions of @xmath67 for various systems . </S>",
    "<S> for the numerical illustration of our analysis , we assume that the bose and fermi particles masses equal that of the free electron , except for the cooper pairs whose mass is twice as large . </S>",
    "<S> the particle concentrations are @xmath70 @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xmath73 for the 2d and 3d systems respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of the dashed lines on both panels simply reflects the logarithmic behaviours of @xmath52 and @xmath23 , but outside the limit of validity of the model ( @xmath74 ) , so they have no physical meaning ; for the fluctuation cooper pairs , only the black parts of the curves are relevant and meaningful . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath67-dependences of @xmath52 and @xmath23 are , as expected , essentially the same for the bose gases and the fermi gas : they converge towards a finite value as @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> unlike the ratio @xmath52 , @xmath23 has a maximum : as @xmath4 increases , the entropy per particle @xmath76 can only increase for a fixed number of particles as thermal energy is put into the system ; but as @xmath23 also contains a @xmath77 term , it is the rapidly increasing product @xmath78 , which lowers @xmath23 in the high temperature regime . </S>",
    "<S> this is in stark contrast with the diverging behaviour near @xmath79 , i.e. at _ finite _ temperature for the fluctuation coopers.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    focusing first on the two bose gases and the fermi gas , we see on fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : figure1 ] , that as their temperatures increase , the ratios @xmath52 increase monotonically while the figures of merit @xmath23 do not : they reach a maximum value for each particular case and then decrease . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour observed for the ratio @xmath52 is akin to that of the ratio @xmath21 discussed in textbooks , and is of limited interest here since the increase results from the rise of temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we also see that as @xmath80 decreases after reaching its maximum , a temperature increase can not guarantee optimal conditions for the working fluid . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , for the two bose gases @xmath51 increases but more slowly than @xmath81 does , and it saturates , which means that the capacity at which the system may store thermal energy dominates its capacity to store bosonic charges as the temperature increases up to a certain point . for the fermi system </S>",
    "<S> @xmath51 decreases , and in this case , it is the capacity of the system to store fermionic charges that dominates its capacity to store thermal energy . </S>",
    "<S> this may appear as a counter - intuitive fact due to the pauli - blocking mechanism , but it is precisely this latter which permits this : for a given particle number , the bose distribution falls off more rapidly than the fermi distribution does and it even gets smaller from a point which depends on the temperature , and as shown by its definition , the electrical capacitance @xmath50 follows essentially the behaviour of the statistical distribution to which it is related . </S>",
    "<S> now , unlike the three cases discussed above , the range over which @xmath52 and @xmath23 vary for the fluctuation cooper pairs is restricted to @xmath82 . </S>",
    "<S> the key point here is that the thermodynamic figure of merit _ and _ the thermoelectric heat capacity ratio behave in the same fashion : both diverge as @xmath4 approaches @xmath25 , which is a finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is precisely the desired behaviour , which ensures that the working fluid s thermoelastic properties are optimal , but this is possible only at the cost of very specific conditions on the system s temperature .    [ [ discussion - and - concluding - remarks ] ] discussion and concluding remarks + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we showed with the illustrative case of 2d fluctuation cooper pairs that approaching the phase transition of the electronic working fluid provides the best and ultimate way of significant performance increase , as the thermoelectric coupling as well as the heat capacity ratio and the thermodynamic figure of merit show a divergent behaviour as @xmath62 . that the heat capacity ratio may diverge implies that @xmath43 increases faster than @xmath44 does for the 2d fluctuation cooper pairs as the system approaches the critical temperature . in classical thermodynamics , </S>",
    "<S> the heat capacity at constant pressure @xmath19 may increase while the heat capacity at constant volume @xmath83 may not , the more compressible a fluid is . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the electronic systems of interest for thermoelectric applications are those whose compressibility is sufficiently high so that the thermoelectric heat capacity ratio @xmath52 may significantly increase or even diverge at finite temperature . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the conclusions of a study of the superconducting properties of carbon nanotube ropes @xcite : as the compressibility increases , the system becomes inhomogeneous as reflected by the density - density correlation function . </S>",
    "<S> it is also of interest to note that eq </S>",
    "<S> .   assumes a very simple form and that it may be applied to any system which may be described with a fluctuation cooper pair approach . </S>",
    "<S> possible systems include those that allow excitonic bcs - like pairing of two electrons @xcite , and particularly those which couple to light such as quatron - polaritons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , owing to their minute effective mass and high critical temperature @xcite an estimation of the parameter @xmath56 of eq .   for quatrons ( in the appendix ) shows it is seven orders of magnitude greater than that of standard 2d fluctuation cooper pairs . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that one may expect a _ huge _ </S>",
    "<S> fluctuation bosonic thermoelectric effect above the quatron superconducting transition , and that quatrons could also boast a giant thermomagnetic response .    </S>",
    "<S> we specialized our study on the thermodynamics of the electronic working fluid rather than the actual transport problem or , equivalently , on the chemical potential rather than the electrochemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> it is the difference of this latter between two reservoirs that generates the electromotive force responsible for the electrical current in thermoelectric devices ; so inasmuch an electrical potential does not affect the temperature - dependence of the thermoelastic properties of the working fluid , we could essentially concentrate on their optimization , the necessity of which has been clearly demonstrated with the temperature - dependence of @xmath52 and that of @xmath23 for different systems . that @xmath23 may diverge in one case , but not for the standard three others ( irrespective of statistics and dimensionality ) thus explains why after decades of intense efforts to improve their performance , thermoelectric devices still remain poorly efficient energy - conversion devices . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuation regime studied in this work , where either phonons or excitons are put to work to bind electrons , illustrates the actual possibility to prepare highly compressible electrically charged working fluids ; but electronic systems in different configurations to be found , could also present enhanced thermoelectric properties as long as they boast a high compressibility factor . </S>",
    "<S> we thus wish to stimulate experimental activities in this genuinely promising new direction . </S>"
