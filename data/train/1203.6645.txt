    "evidence in the past year from experiments at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite and the fermilab tevatron  @xcite encourages a strong sense of anticipation that the long - sought neutral higgs boson is on the verge of discovery with mass in the vicinity of 125 gev . as more data are analyzed , and the lhc energy is increased from 7 to 8  tev , experimental investigations will naturally turn toward determination of the properties of the observed mass enhancement  particularly , the branching fractions into pairs of gauge bosons , standard model fermions , and possibly other states .    the original formulation of electroweak symmetry breaking focused on couplings of the higgs boson to massive gauge bosons  @xcite .",
    "tree - level yukawa couplings between fermions and higgs bosons came later in the current version of the `` standard model '' ( sm ) in which the higgs boson serves as the agent for generation of fermion masses as well as gauge boson masses .",
    "proposals have also been made of higgs doublets  @xcite or triplets  @xcite in which the higgs boson is explicitly `` fermiophobic , '' namely , without tree - level couplings to fermions .    in this paper",
    ", we emphasize a measurement that offers the possibility to test a broad class of models where higgs boson couplings to fermions , if they exist , are small enough that they do not affect the branching fractions to gauge bosons .",
    "we focus on @xmath2 associated production where @xmath1 decays into a pair of photons , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , @xmath8 decays into a pair of jets , @xmath9 .",
    "we investigate whether the peak observed near 125  gev in the diphoton @xmath10 invariant mass spectrum  @xcite in the 7  tev lhc data provides support for a suppressed fermion coupling hypothesis .",
    "we show that this process offers excellent prospects for distinguishing a fermiophobic higgs boson from a standard model higgs boson .",
    "the phenomenology of a fermiophobic higgs boson is very different from the sm case .",
    "since the coupling to top quarks @xmath11 is suppressed , a fermiophobic higgs boson is not produced through the dominant sm production channel , the gluon - gluon fusion process @xmath12 , where the interaction occurs through a top - quark loop .",
    "rather , production of a fermiophobic higgs boson occurs in association with an electroweak gauge boson @xmath13 where @xmath14 , @xmath8 , or through vector boson fusion ( vbf ) , @xmath15 . between these two modes ,",
    "the relative cross section favors vbf , but @xmath2 associated production offers the opportunity to observe a final state in which there are two potentially prominent resonances in coincidence , the higgs boson peak in @xmath16 along with the @xmath0 peak in the dijet mass distribution @xmath17 . the favorable branching fraction for @xmath17 guides our choice of this decay channel rather than the leptonic decays @xmath18 or @xmath19 .",
    "the lhc atlas and cms collaborations consider the fermiophobic possibility in two recent papers  @xcite . in the @xmath20 channel",
    ", cms requires the transverse energy of the two jets to be larger than 30 and 20 gev , with large pseudorapidity separation between the jets ( @xmath21 ) and dijet invariant mass larger than 350  gev .",
    "these cuts are designed for the vbf production process . in the @xmath2 channel , they concentrate on the leptonic decay modes of the vector bosons . while the background is smaller , the signal is suppressed by the small branching fraction to leptons",
    ". atlas uses the inclusive diphoton channel @xmath22 . in the diphoton mass region near 125 gev , atlas sees some evidence for an increase in the signal to background ratio at large values of the transverse momentum of the diphoton pair .",
    "this increase is qualitatively consistent with the expectation of a harder higgs boson @xmath23 spectrum from vbf and associated production , compared to the sm gluon fusion mechanism . on the other hand",
    ", the ratio of the higgs signal to qcd background in the @xmath24 channel also improves with @xmath23 of the higgs boson in the sm  @xcite , so the @xmath23 spectrum alone is not a good discriminator . the fermiophobic possibility must be reconciled also with a tevatron collider enhancement in the @xmath25 mass spectrum  @xcite in the general vicinity of 125 gev , implying a possible coupling of the higgs boson to fermions . however , these results have yet to be corroborated by lhc data and could be interpreted in a model in which effective yukawa couplings are radiatively induced  @xcite .    the emphasis in this paper is placed on the investigation of the fermiophobic option in associated production , with @xmath0 decay to a pair of jets .",
    "we compute the expected signal rates from associated production and vbf , and the backgrounds from @xmath26 in perturbative quantum chromodynamics . adopting event selections similar to those used by the lhc collaborations , we show that the current @xmath27  fb@xmath3 might contain @xmath281.9 standard deviation ( @xmath4 ) evidence for a fermiophobic higgs boson in the @xmath29 channel .",
    "we argue that clear evidence ( @xmath5 ) of a fermiophobic higgs boson could be obtained by study of the @xmath13 channel at 8  tev with @xmath30  fb@xmath3 of integrated luminosity .",
    "we urge concentrated experimental effort on higgs plus vector boson associated production .",
    "fermiophobic higgs bosons are produced predominantly via @xmath2 ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) associated production or vector boson fusion ( vbf ) .",
    "associated production will produce hard jets if @xmath17 [ fig.[fig : feyn]a ] , with the invariant mass of the dijet system @xmath31 showing a resonance structure in the electroweak gauge boson mass region ( @xmath328091 gev ) .",
    "vector boson fusion is characterized by two hard forward jets [ fig .",
    "[ fig : feyn]b ] , and it contributes a long tail to the dijet invariant mass distribution , with few events in the @xmath33 mass region . in contrast , additional jets from production of a sm higgs boson are mostly from soft initial state radiation off the gluon - gluon fusion initial state .",
    "we exploit these different event topologies to distinguish a fermiophobic higgs boson from a standard model higgs boson .     associated production with @xmath1 decay to diphotons and @xmath34 decay to dijets , and ( b ) vbf production of @xmath35dijets . ]",
    "the contribution to diphoton production from a fermiophobic higgs is surprisingly large .",
    "while the cross section for fermiophobic higgs production is suppressed compared to the sm by an order of magnitude , the branching fraction for @xmath36 is correspondingly increased .",
    "the net result is that the production cross section for @xmath37 for a fermiophobic higgs boson is predicted to be nearly identical to that of a sm higgs boson @xcite .    in order to compare directly with data , we begin with a higgs to diphoton signal analysis by the atlas collaboration @xcite .",
    "atlas sees an excess of events when compared to either the fermiophobic or sm higgs models of a factor of @xmath38 @xcite . since we wish to distinguish a fermiophobic higgs signal from a sm higgs signal , we focus on predicting the _ fraction _ of the atlas @xmath36 data sample that should contain a dijet invariant mass peak @xmath31 near the @xmath39 and @xmath8 masses .",
    "hence , we normalize the total number of events in our signal predictions by this experimental factor of 2 .",
    "three fermiophobic higgs signal processes should contribute to the atlas diphoton mass peak : @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and vbf . in order to determine the proportion of each signal process we calculate the acceptance of each process at next - to - leading - order in qcd .",
    "we generate weighted signal events using mcfm @xcite , where we substitute photons for @xmath42 quarks in the final state , and use hdecay @xcite to correct for the branching fraction for @xmath36 .",
    "we impose atlas inspired  @xcite acceptance cuts on the two photons in the final state :    * photon candidates are ordered in transverse energy @xmath43 , and the leading ( subleading ) candidate is required to have @xmath44 gev ( 25 gev ) ; * both photons must satisfy pseudorapidity cuts of @xmath45 or @xmath46 ; * both photons must be isolated with at most 5  gev of energy deposited in a cone of @xmath47 around the candidate , where @xmath48 is the azimuthal angle , after the photon energy is removed .",
    "we determine the number of events that should appear in each production channel after atlas photon acceptance cuts by applying a photon reconstruction and identification efficiency .",
    "this efficiency is 65% for @xmath49 gev and 95% for @xmath50 gev .",
    "we do a linear extrapolation of photon efficiencies for other values of photon @xmath43 , and assume that it is 100% for a photon with @xmath51  gev .",
    "we use the atlas isolation cut acceptance of 87% for a 120 gev higgs boson  @xcite . as a cross check ,",
    "we calculate the diphoton acceptance for the gluon - gluon fusion channel using the same method and find a cut acceptance of 34.9% , in very good agreement with the 35% given by atlas  @xcite .",
    "the numbers of events predicted in 4.9  fb@xmath3 at 7  tev from the @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and vbf channels before and after atlas acceptance cuts ( scaled by the factor of 2 above ) are shown in table  [ tab : after_diphotoncuta ] .",
    "vector boson fusion supplies the largest fraction of the higgs diphoton events .",
    "however , since the distinguishing feature is a @xmath39 or @xmath8 dijet mass peak in the @xmath2 final state of interest to us , our additional cuts are optimized to select the @xmath40 and @xmath41 processes .",
    ".numbers of signal and background events after cuts expected in @xmath27  fb@xmath3 of data at 7  tev .",
    "atlas @xmath52 cuts in the second line include photon acceptances , efficiencies , and isolation .",
    "[ tab : after_diphotoncuta ] [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]        of data .",
    "shaded bands show the statistical uncertainty of the background .",
    "the second bin covers the vector boson mass region @xmath53 . ]",
    "in this paper , we investigate the possibility of using present @xcite and future diphoton data from the lhc to distinguish a fermiophobic higgs boson from a sm higgs boson . unlike the sm higgs ,",
    "nearly 40% of fermiophobic higgs bosons are produced in association with a @xmath39 or @xmath8 vector boson .",
    "since the largest branching fraction for these vector boson decays is into jets , we focus on @xmath17 and devise cut - based analyses that attempt to provide a clean signal and large significance . we show that a @xmath4 significance excess could be found in the existing 4.9  fb@xmath3 of data at 7  tev . with the anticipated 10  fb@xmath3 to be acquired soon at 8  tev",
    ", we find that @xmath5 evidence should be possible .",
    "we expect that these significances could be improved by including additional angular correlations in the dijet system and between the diphoton and dijet systems , perhaps in a neural - net based approach , and we encourage the experimental collaborations to expand upon the analysis presented here .",
