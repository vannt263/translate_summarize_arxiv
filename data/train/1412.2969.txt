    "a wide range of astronomical evidence suggests the existence of a gravitationally - interacting , non - luminous component of the universe which has yet to be identified .",
    "this dark matter ( dm ) component comprises approximately 27% of the energy density of the universe , and is responsible for the galactic structures visible today  @xcite .",
    "there are viable arguments that dm could be composed of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) , and the darkside-50 ( ds ) experiment is a search for wimp - nuclear collisions as a fixed detector on earth moves through the wimp field of the milky way .",
    "such interactions are rare , and impart usable recoil energies of @xmath0kev to a nucleus @xcite .",
    "thus to reach the required sensitivities , detectors having large target masses and background suppression are needed .",
    "a number of technologies are now used for direct detection of dark matter wimps .",
    "these include ; cryogenic bolometers with ionization or scintillation detection , sodium / cesium iodide scintillation detectors , bubble chambers , a point contact germanium detector , and liquid noble gas detectors filled with xenon or argon .",
    "+ the heart of the darkside-50 ( ds ) experiment is a 50 kg time projection chamber ( tpc ) which is a two - phase liquid argon ( lar ) detector . the ds system is designed to achieve background - free operation for at least 0.1 tonne - year of exposure .",
    "the tpc exploits the extraordinary pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) of lar  @xcite providing powerful rejection of electromagnetic ( electron or gamma induced ) signals .",
    "cosmogenic background is suppressed to very low levels by mounting ds at a 3800 mwe ( water equivalent ) depth at the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) laboratory  @xcite  @xcite , and surrounding the tpc with two nested veto shields of high purity water ( ctf ) and liquid scintillator ( lsv ) , figure  [ dsexp ] .",
    "in addition , local radioactive background is significantly reduced by efficient chemical and cryogenic purification methods @xcite .",
    "the experiment uses argon obtained from gas wells ( uar ) which is depleted in the radioactive @xmath1ar isotope  @xcite . despite the small detector size , ds has a sensitivity to wimp - nucleon cross sections of approximately @xmath2 @xmath3 for a wimp mass of @xmath4 gev / c@xmath5 .",
    "+    this paper describes the ds electronics , the data collection and event - building systems ( daq ) , and the slow control and data monitoring systems of the experiment .",
    "darkside-50 consists of three embedded detector systems .",
    "viewed from the inner to the outer these systems are : a lar tpc , a liquid scintillator system ( lsv ) composed of 50% ppo ( 2,5-diphenyloxazole ) + 50% tmb ( trimethylbenzene )  @xcite , and a water cherenkov veto system ( ctf ) which also acts to shield the lsv and tpc from local radioactive background . an enclosed clean room ( clr ) sits atop the ctf , and is used to insert the tpc , and to provide internal access to the vetoes when the water and scintillator are removed .",
    "the clr isolates the tpc and its components from surface radioactivity , particular radon , during assembly . + electrical connections to the tpc , approximately 5 - 10  m in length , are made through vacuum - tight pipes from the tpc to a feed - through in a flange on the floor of the clr . to minimize noise from the pmt signals ,",
    "the tpc front end electronics are located in the clr racks just above the flange , which is as close as possible to the tpc .",
    "however , readout of the veto signals from the lsv and ctf are patched through the side of the ctf to a control room ( cor ) by cables some 40  m in length .",
    "thus synchronization of these systems is one of the electronic challenges and is addressed below .",
    "the tpc , shown in figure  [ dstpc ] , is a cylindrical detector containing 50  kg of lar .",
    "the inner cylindrical surface of the detector is a teflon reflector coated with wavelength shifter ( tetraphenyl butadiene )  @xcite .",
    "the coating absorbs the 128  nm scintillation photons emitted by excitation in the lar , and re - emits visible photons which are viewed by thirty - eight hamamatsu low - background r11065 pmt  @xcite .",
    "the pmt are divided equally between the top and bottom surfaces of the cylindrical tpc , and receive the wavelength - shifted light through fused silica windows .",
    "these windows are also coated with the wavelength shifter on the inner surfaces and have transparent conductive layers of indium tin oxide ( ito ) evaporated on both the inner and outer surfaces .",
    "coating both surfaces with ito allows the inner window surface to serve as a grounded anode ( top ) and a high voltage cathode ( bottom ) of the tpc , while maintaining the outer surfaces at the average pmt photocathode potential .",
    "the fused silica anode ( top ) window has a cylindrical rim extending downward into the tpc to form a 1 cm - thick gas pocket above the lar .",
    "high voltage is applied between the tpc cathode and anode to produce , by field shaping rings , a uniform electric field throughout the active volume .",
    "also , light from lar excitations ( s1 ) is collected by the pmt .",
    "electrons from ionization drift upwards in the electric field , eventually reaching the liquid surface where they are extracted , and accelerated in the gas pocket producing secondary ionization light ( s2 ) .",
    "the drift time of the ionization charge in the lar , and the amplitude of the light signal in the gas are adjustable by varying the potentials on the cathode and an extraction grid placed just below the lar surface .",
    "this design not only provides three - dimensional information of the position of the event in the lar , but also allows additional discrimination between the ionization due to ar recoils and that of electromagnetic interactions , ( _ ie _ @xmath6 or @xmath7 events ) .",
    "however , the experimentally applied discrimination mainly uses the ratio of the fast component of the ( s1 ) ionization signal ( the first 90 ns ) to its total integral  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to minimize electronic noise and use a low frequency cutoff to accurately determine the timing of the detected photo electrons .",
    "+      as explained above , wavelength - shifted light from an event in the lar was viewed through fused silica windows by 38 low - background pmt .",
    "although the pmt were not placed in the sensitive volume of the tpc , they were immersed in lar and operated at a temperature of approximately 87  k. after extensive testing , it was found that charge accumulation on internal components in the pmt induced erratic behavior .",
    "this was mitigated by decreasing the tube voltage , reducing the pmt gain to a few @xmath8 .",
    "however , the reduced gain required a local pre - amplifier operating at lar temperatures to drive the signals through the approximate 5 - 10  m of cable to the amplifiers in the clr without significant contribution from noise and dispersion .",
    "both the tpc amplifiers and digitizers were located in racks in the clr , just above the ctf .",
    "+      the cryogenic pre - amplifier is mounted directly on the pmt base as shown figure  [ preamp_fig ] .",
    "it was constructed using discrete components as illustrated in figure  [ preamp_circuit ] .",
    "power - loss density is important as the pre - amplifier is mounted on the pmt base which is immersed in lar .",
    "local boiling can cause a multitude of problems in high voltages , electronics , and tpc operations . consequently the pre - amplifier is designed with a total power consumption of less than 90 mw / channel .",
    "it is also constructed to be as radio - pure as possible , which required the use of a cirlex  @xcite circuit board , low radioactive components , and the avoidance of copper - beryllium ( cube ) connectors .",
    "its input impedance is determined by the internal stray - capacitance of the pmt and the optimization of signal - to - noise by waveform shaping .",
    "the relatively high - load resistance produces a passive gain with respect to the pmt coupling and is back terminated by 50 @xmath9 .",
    "the active gain of the pre - amplifier is 3 v / v , for a total 24v / v compared to the output without a pre - amplifier .",
    "the maximum output is 3v providing a dynamic range in excess of 1500 photoelectrons ( pe ) .",
    "pole - zero cancellation is applied to the output signals sent to the amplifier .",
    "high quality , double shielded cables  @xcite are used to transmit these signals from the tpc to the amplifiers in the clr .",
    "+      special care was taken to maintain high signal integrity during the implementation .",
    "thus , sma rf connectors and double shielded signal cables are used where ever possible .",
    "the cryogenic pre - amplifiers used surface mounted components with a grounded , full - copper backplane . the power supply was carefully filtered to reduce noise components .",
    "impedance matching and signal reflection of the output signals were also adjusted to minimize cross - talk and electromagnetic interference ( emi ) .",
    "+ while the hermetically sealed cryostat containing the pre - amplifiers should provide shielding from external noise sources , penetrations by signal , test , and power cables conveyed external noise to the pre - amplifiers .",
    "this is exacerbated by the requirement that the pmt anodes were maintained at ground potential in order to use dc signal coupling , so that the metal envelope of the pmt remained floating at the cathode potential and could not be easily shielded .",
    "consequently interference pick - up by the pmt dynodes becomes impressed on the photocurrents prior to amplification .",
    "given the above issues , noise abatement required simultaneously considering the full detector system , including the cryogenetic and the slow control components , as well as the tpc electronics .",
    "it was found that pump - drivers , switching power supplies , telecommunication transceivers , and high voltage supplies all provided contribution to the signal noise .",
    "these were addressed in situ after installation .",
    "+ pump motor controllers were especially noisy sources because most sent unfiltered and un - shielded signals to the appliance they controlled .",
    "these sources of noise were mitigated by variac - based sinusoidal motor controls .",
    "noisy switching power supplies were identified and individually treated by filtering or replacing the supplies with linear components .",
    "in particular , noise from the pmt high voltage ( hv ) supplies was reduced by adding filters to the hv output .",
    "+ ground loops were also mitigated by floating all connections through the cryostat wall . at the same time , all cable shields were connected via low - inductance ac coupling to the cryostat surface , to reduce the rf energy which would otherwise enter the cryostat . as a result , the noise at the output of the amplifier chain is dominated by the pre - amplifier electronic noise floor .",
    "thus there are no noise - dominant spectral components within the frequency range of interest .",
    "the output noise is 70 @xmath10v for an active bandwidth of 150 mhz .",
    "+    a picture of the cryogenic pre - amplifier mounted of the pmt base    the circuit diagram of the cryogenic pre - amplifier      the amplifier in the clr provides further amplification and signal conditioning .",
    "the coupling between the pre - amplifier and the amplifier boards is illustrated in figure  [ fe_coupling ] .",
    "one amplifier module handles five channels and provides the following outputs for each channel . +    * an amplified output with gain of 10 v / v and an input noise equivalent of 20 @xmath10v over a bandwidth of 200 mhz .",
    "this output is typically used for monitoring the performance of specific channels * a shaped output with a gain of 10 v / v with a bandwidth of 90 mhz and a noise equivalent of 15 @xmath10v .",
    "the bandwidth is matched to the sampling frequency of the caen v1720 digitizer which samples at 250 ms / s * an attenuated output with gain of 0.5 v / v with bandwidth of 40 mhz .",
    "the bandwidth of this output is matched to the sampling frequency of the caen 1724 digitizer sampling at 100 ms / s * discriminated low - voltage - differential - signals ( lvds ) , with a minimum pulse duration of 4 ns .",
    "the discrimination threshold is remotely programmable .",
    "these signals are sent to the trigger unit , and to scalars for monitoring    all outputs are tuned to match the -2 to 1 v dynamic range of the digitizers .",
    "the typical output noise is approximately 1  mv , 50% of which is due to the digitizer .",
    "the @xmath1110 gain signals are sent to caen v1720 250 mhz 12 bit waveform digitizers @xcite and the low gain signals sent to caen v1724 100 mhz 14 bit digitizers .",
    "both digitizer types are one unit 6u vme64x vme modules , servicing eight channels .",
    "they have circular memory buffers of 10 ms / ch , and are locally fpga compliant .",
    "the use of two digitizer types extends the dynamic range , providing a linear response between 1 and 10,000 pe , capturing signals without saturation from both lar and ar gas .",
    "the large dynamic range also improves calibration options and provides a more detailed study of backgrounds .",
    "+ the multiple adcs are synchronized with a common 50 mhz clock and external trigger .",
    "they run in parallel and require three common control signals : a `` trigger '' , a `` run - enable '' , and a `` clock '' .",
    "the trigger and run - enable can be either ttl or nim level signals , however the clock signals are differential lvds .",
    "the distribution of all signals requires equal delays in a star - like topology in order to keep timing synchronization . +",
    "as described above , there are two embedded veto systems , a water cherenkov detector ( ctf ) , and a liquid scintillator detector ( lsv ) .",
    "the effectiveness of these veto systems is described in  @xcite and included references .",
    "the ctf is an active veto , tagging penetrating cosmic muons and cosmogenically produced charged showers in materials surrounding ds and shielding the tpc and lsv from external radioactivity .",
    "the ctf is a cylindrical , steel tank , 11  m in diameter and 10  m high , filled with 1000 tons of high - purity water .",
    "it is instrumented along the floor and bottom half of the cylindrical wall by 80 etl-9351 8 inch pmt @xcite .",
    "studies revealed little spatial dependence of the pmt placement , so they were more - or - less equally spaced .",
    "the walls are covered with reflecting  @xcite tyvek sheets .",
    "the veto electronics for both the lsv and ctf are located in the cor .",
    "+ the lsv is a 4  m diameter , stainless steel sphere which lies inside the ctf and encloses the tpc . it is filled with liquid scintillator and instrumented with 110 hammatsu r5912-hqe - lri 8 inch pmt  @xcite .",
    "the interior walls of the sphere are covered with reflecting lumirror sheets @xcite .",
    "the lsv is designed to moderate , capture , and thus provide a veto signal for neutrons which might enter , or exit , the tpc .",
    "neutrons can be thermalized by scattering from protons in the scintillator liquid , and are efficiently captured by @xmath12b nuclei .",
    "capture on @xmath12b proceeds to the @xmath13li ground state ( gs ) and a @xmath13li excited state with branching ratios of 6.4 % and 93.6 % , respectively .",
    "the ground state decays by emitting a @xmath14kev @xmath15 particle , and the excited state decays with emission of a @xmath16kev @xmath15 particle and a 478 kev @xmath7 .",
    "+ the measured lsv light yield is @xmath17pe / mev .",
    "scintillation light produced by the nuclear products of the @xmath13li(gs ) decay is quenched and is expected to have a beta - equivalent energy between 60 to 60 kev corresponding to 25 - 30 pe .",
    "neutrons can also capture on hydrogen with the emission of a @xmath18 mev @xmath7-ray yielding approximately @xmath19  pe .",
    "+ most photons are collected in about 100  ns , but the tail of the distribution extends some 300  ns , and must be considered when designing the appropriate dynamic range of the acquisition electronics .",
    "for example , the average number of photons per channel in an event with energy @xmath20kev is typically less than one , but can increase by more than an order of magnitude when a neutron is captured near a pmt .",
    "in addition , a muon crossing the lsv produces a large signal corresponding to approximately 2  mev per transit - length in the scintillator .",
    "thus to correctly determine the path of a muon , the veto electronics must be able to efficiently detect a signal as small as 0.3  pe , but should gracefully handle signals which saturate the front end electronics .",
    "although the most important events occur at low energy , the system should recover from saturation in less than 2  @xmath10s .",
    "+ good timing is also important in order to obtain track reconstruction .",
    "this requires knowledge and stability of the relative time differences between pmts for both vetoes  @xcite .",
    "therefore time alignment and synchronization among channels must have a precision of @xmath21 0.3  ns , and remain stable for at least a 24 hour period .",
    "+      output signals from the veto pmts are ac coupled directly to amplifiers through approximately 40  m of low dispersion , 50  @xmath9 , coaxial cable .",
    "the front end analog boards ( feab ) and front end digital boards ( fedb ) are designed to match the input timing , noise , and impedance of the pmt signals , but more importantly they match the bandwidth of the waveform digitizers .",

    "is used to synchronize the v1495 and the veto fpga modules .",
    "+      figure  [ global_trigger ] shows the generation and flow of trigger signals . unless otherwise noted , signals in the block diagram are active high ttl , ecl or lvds .",
    "there are four fpga - based trigger logic units .",
    "these are ;    1 .",
    "tpc v1495 trigger module located at the tpc site ( clr ) ; 2 .",
    "v1495 trigger module located at the veto site ( cor ) ; 3 .",
    "veto fanout v1495 module located at the veto site ( cor ) ; 4 .",
    "veto fpga pxie-7961 logic module located in the pxie crate ( cor )    a 32-bit trigger - id is generated for each trigger , acquired by the pxie timing module , and routed to the veto fpga for decoding .",
    "the time stamps and the trigger - id are saved in a dma buffer in the veto fpga and are read asynchronously by the veto daq .",
    "thus , the trigger - id is read out via the vme bus as a part of the tpc data stream , and the same trigger - id and the trigger signal are also available for the veto daq readout via a digital adapter module , ni 6583  @xcite , attached to a veto fpga .",
    "a 24-bit `` event - counter '' is programmed to count all incoming triggers for each event .",
    "this allows the same event to be correlated between different adcs as they all have identical time tags .",
    "the event counters are stored in the data header . both the tpc and veto counters are synchronized at the beginning of the run by the external run - enable signal , and all systems are kept in synchronization using a `` star '' distribution with equal time delays of clock , trigger and run - enable signals .",

    "+ three counters are recorded and used to create a time stamp for each trigger .",
    "these are listed below .    *",
    "the 1pps counter counts the number of seconds elapsed between the trigger and run - enable signal .",

    "* the gps fine - time counter counts the number of @xmath40  mhz clock cycles elapsed between the trigger and either the run - enable or 1pps signal , as determined by whichever signal occurs last .",
    "the fine - time counter represents the number of 20  ns bins between either the run - enable or 1pps signal depending on the selected signal . *",
    "the gps one - second - counter counts the number of @xmath40  mhz clock cycles between the 1pps signal occurring just prior to the run - enable signal and the run - enable signal itself .",
    "this counter is used to provide the number of @xmath40mhz cycles between a prior 1pps signal and the following run - enable signal .",
    "the counters are stored in the veto fpga memory , and provide the time of a trigger with respect to the run - start with a precision of @xmath43  ns .",
    "this creates a unique time - stamp for a triggered event .",
    "identical time stamps are computed by the tpc and veto daq systems , so that synchronization of events can be maintained .",
    "+      a secondary data stream for the veto system is implemented using tdcs .",
    "one of the discriminated fedb veto outputs from each channel is connected to a caen v1190 multi - hit 128 channel tdc  @xcite .",
    "the two 1190 modules are located in the cor and connect to the tpc v1495 trigger unit through the local v1495 fanout logic unit .",
    "this secondary system does not replace the main veto readout but provides a back - up system and solves some tpc integration issues .",
    "consequently the tdc provides an independent data stream for the lsv and ctf vetoes , and is synchronized to the tpc trigger providing a check on the efficiency of the main veto trigger .",
    "thus a tpc event has direct mapping to the tdc data , and is correlated to the veto adc stream , solving a problem when the veto triggers before a tpc trigger is generated .",
    "+      the clock and fan - out , cfm  @xcite , is an `` in - house '' , single width 6u vme module .",
    "the input accepts ttl , lvttl , or cmos signals with selective 50 or 10k @xmath9 termination .",
    "in addition a second connector accepts standard lvds signals and is pin compatible with the caen v1720 adc pinouts .",

    "it is assumed that the tpc and veto systems run independently at selected times , collecting data with their own triggers .",
    "for this reason , two modes of operation are available , which can be selected using a run mode register stored at each site . +    1 .",
    "the system can run in local mode , in which each sub - system receives and records only its own triggers ; or 2 .",
    "the system can run with event synchronization were the tpc daq system is the master .",
    "the daq is designed for high parallelization , as illustrated in figure  [ tpc_diagram ] .",
    "there are five , 8-channel caen v1724 digitizers and five , 8-channel v1724 digitizers which are read via optical cable into the pci interface  @xcite of three local computers .",
    "one of these clr computers is also optically connected to the vme bus through the caen 2718 crate controller , sharing information with the v1495 logic trigger module and therefore with the caen 1190 multi - hit tdcs in the cor .",
    "digitizer output signals are sent to fragment servers and are multiplexed through a 40 gb optical fiber from the clr to the cor .",
    "all computers run the artdaq software  @xcite tools which transfer data from the front - end computers through the daq system to disk , and provide a selection of events for online data quality monitoring , figure  [ artdaq ] .",
    "the event builder compresses the data and an `` aggregator - server '' puts the events in sequential order storing them on disk .",
    "the aggregator also provides events for online monitoring , including run parameters from disk files , and closes files at appropriate times during a run .",
    "+      the veto daq architecture is designed to acquire data from 4 different pxie controllers , preserving synchronization between each device and the tpc .",
    "the system software is constructed of two software elements : acquisition - and - readout software and builder software .",
    "software is developed in labview , and conforms to labview coding and documentation standards .",
    "the veto daq uses the parallelism inherent in labview to perform the main operations .",
    "+ the readout software implements the following tasks :    * it acts as a server to listen for commands from the run controller ( _ e.g. _ to request the start and stop data acquisition , communicate the status of the system , or provide the number of acquired events ) ; * it checks cpu , and memory usage in the controller ; * it drives a state machine to perform the data acquisition operations ( _ e.g. _ initialize hardware , fetch data , stop , etc . ) ; * it communicates with the fpga module , retrieving the trigger - id and the time stamp of the event ; * it performs zero suppression on the acquired data ; * it bundles zero - suppressed data from different digitizers in a data fragment structure , which contains the time - stamps and the trigger - id of the event ; * it sends data to the veto builder over the network ;    each veto readout software is installed in the pxie controllers and is automatically loaded when the controller boots .",
    "the veto daq architecture is based on a producer - consumer data flow driven by a state machine .",
    "communication over the network uses the labview simple messaging reference library ( stm ) .",
    "the content of a message is parsed , evaluated , and a response message broadcast . during data acquisition ,",
    "data fragments from every chassis are collected by the veto builder .",
    "the builder checks the consistency of the trigger - id and timestamps of the data fragments .",
    "finally , the events are entered in sequential order and written on disk in a custom binary format .",
    "the daq sub - systems are handled by a common run controller which is configured to permit differential data acquisition modes .",
    "1 .   global runs , where the tpc and veto triggers are correlated , and 2 .",
    "local runs , where sub - detectors can be run independently .",
    "the run controller handles the initialization , start - up , and stopping of data acquisition , and logs to the experimental data base relevant run parameters , such as the tpc and veto configuration .",
    "the run controller also supervises the data acquisition .",
    "when a sub - systems displays unusual behavior , data acquisition is stopped and the daq sub - systems are reset and re - initialized .",
    "the run controller is developed in labview , and conforms to labview coding and documentation standards .",
    "communication over a network with the tpc sub - systems is performed using the xml - rpc protocol , while communication with veto sub - systems is performed using labview stm protocol .",
    "this paper reports the electronics and data acquisition systems developed for the darkside-50 dm search .",
