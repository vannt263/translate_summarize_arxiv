    "generating and maintaining the entanglement between two spatially seperated atoms plays an important role in many quantum information processing , such as quantum storage@xcite , quantum key distribution@xcite and quantum states swapping@xcite , since need no transmitting real particles to distance . to efficiently entangle two distant atoms , one must creat some kind of interaction that is off - diagonal in its energy eigenstates representation .",
    "generally , such interaction is equivalent to exchange real photons between two spatially related atoms .",
    "many schemes have been proposed to realize this kind of entanglement[4 - 13 ] .",
    "most of these schemes involve two cavities in each of which an atom is trapped . in ref .",
    "[ 4 ] , the author proposed such a scheme .",
    "he showed how an effective direct interaction between two atoms is established .",
    "the author used photon as an intermediate quantum information carrier to map the quantum information from an atom in one cavity to an atom in another cavity . by eliminating the optical fields ingoing and outgoing the local cavity",
    ", the author found that two distant atoms can directly interact in a form of ising spin - spin coupling .",
    "it is meaningful conceptually in quantum measurement and testing bell s inequalities and engineeringly in quantum encryption@xcite and constructing universal quantum gate@xcite that are essential elements for designing quantum network . while , in realizing quantum network , an atomic ensemble is usually required@xcite .",
    "the existence of collective interaction inevitably influence the entanglement shared by atoms . in this paper , we extend the model in ref . [ 4 ] to triple - atom situation .",
    "we focus on investigating the affect of the existence of the third atom on the entanglement properties and the modulation of operating local optical field plus fiber on the information signal .",
    "this system can be easily extended to n - atom system .",
    "fig . 1 shows the imagined triple - atom composed setup .",
    "two - level atoms _ a _ , _ b _ and _ c _ locate in spatially distant cavities 1 , 2 and 3 respectively .",
    "cavities 1 and 3 are assumed to be single - sided cavities , cavity 2 to be double - sided cavity .",
    "an off - resonant driving external field a is added on cavity 1 . in each cavity , a local laser field which is resonantly coupled to the local atom is applied .",
    "two neighbouring cavities are connected with optical fiber .",
    "the hamiltonian for the global system can be written as    @xmath0    in the interaction picture , the hamiltonian should include the interactions between atom and bath and that between field and bath    @xmath1    where@xcite    @xmath2    and@xcite    @xmath3 + \\kappa _ { b , l}\\left [ b_{b , l}(\\omega ) b^{\\dagger } + h.c.\\right ]   \\notag \\\\ & & \\text { \\ \\ \\ } + \\kappa _ { b , r}\\left [ b_{b , r}(\\omega ) b^{\\dagger } + h.c.\\right ] + \\kappa _ { c}\\left [ b_{c}(\\omega ) c^{\\dagger } + h.c.\\right ] \\}\\text{,}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 the field annihilation ( creation ) operators in cavities a , b and c , respectively , @xmath7 with @xmath8 the dipole coupling strength of atom on field and @xmath9 the detuning of field from the atomic internal transition , @xmath10 represents the particle inversion number of atom @xmath11 .",
    "the kinetic equations for the field operators turn out to be@xcite    @xmath12    where @xmath13 , is the amplitude of the input off - resonant driving field in cavity @xmath14 .",
    "if cavities @xmath14 , @xmath15 and cavities @xmath15 , @xmath16 are connected by fiber ( as shown in figure 1 ) , the input - output condition should be included , such that@xcite    @xmath17    assuming all the decay rates @xmath18 and taking into account the usual boundary conditions17    @xmath19    we can rewrite the kinetic equations for field operators as    @xmath20    the phase factors @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the phase delay caused from the photon transmission along the optical fiber .",
    "physically , they depend on the frequency of the photons and the distance between cavities .",
    "the upper equations are non - linear ones since there exist cross terms include field operators multiplying atomic spin operators . to solve the kinetic equation of fields operators explicitly",
    ", these terms must be modified . to do this ,",
    "we make such assumptions : we are interested in the stationary quantum effects of the field - atom system ; strong leakage condition for the cavity ; large detuning from the atomic internal transition ( see the assumption before ) .",
    "thus , only the terms besides the cross ones have apparent large gradients .",
    "the field operators multiplied by atomic spin operators can be approximatly replaced by their stationary values which can be obtained through    @xmath25    we get    @xmath26}{m^{2}(m+\\gamma _ { 0})-m\\gamma _ { 0}[e^{i(\\phi _ { 12}+\\phi _ { 21})}+e^{i(\\phi _ { 23}+\\phi _ { 32})}]}\\text { , }   \\notag \\\\ \\beta & = & \\frac{m\\alpha -\\lambda } { \\gamma _ { 0}e^{i\\phi _ { 12}}}\\text { , } \\gamma = \\frac{\\gamma _ { 0}e^{i\\phi _ { 32}}\\beta } { m}\\text{.}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    now , the nonlinear differential equ .

    "[ 11 ] can be easily solved with laplace transform method . in solving equ . [ 11 ] , we can adiabatically eliminate the effect of vacuum input noise on the cavity field operators .",
    "the resulting field operators are simply represented by linear combinations of atomic spin operators @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 . substituting the field operators into the interaction hamiltonian , we get the effective hamiltonian of the global system in the interaction picture as    @xmath34    which is an triple - body ising type interaction , similar with that in ref .

    "they all turn out to be zero when cavity fields are resonant with atoms and three cavities are spatially much close to each other .",
    "we have neglected local self - energy terms including @xmath41 by choosing appropriate detuning @xmath9 and self - interaction terms that do not change the initial system state in deriving @xmath42 . also , we eliminated high order terms that include @xmath43 since the corresponding coupling strength is much weaker than @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath44 .",
    "in next section , laser fields are employed to induce two - atom entanglement .",
    "in ising model , entanglement can be generated between neighbouring spin sites if each of them is coupled with a magnetic field that do no parallel the spin @xmath45",
    "note that the hamiltonian in equ .",
    "[ 12 ] can not generate any entanglement because it is diagonal in the @xmath46 dimensions atomic subspace .",
    "it is necessary to add a laser field in each cavity which is resonantly interacts with the local atom , so that the additional hamiltonian is given by    @xmath47    where @xmath48 represents the coupling strength of the laser field and the local atom , @xmath49 denotes atom .",
    "the global hamiltonian is the sum of two terms @xmath50 .",
    "in fact , the existence of resonant laser field would take influence on the effective hamiltonian when we take some approximations . in order to keep the validity of deriving @xmath42 ,",
    "the coupling between local atom and the laser field must be assumed much weak .",
    "certainly , this can be easily assured by weakening the amplitude of the laser field or localizing the atom in the cavity since the coupling rate depends on the atom position as @xmath51$]@xcite .",
    "we are interested in the two - atom subsystem entanglement which is widely used in quantum key distribution and quantum encoding .",
    "wootters proposed a general measurement of two - qubit entanglement which is named as concurrence@xcite    @xmath52    where @xmath53 are the none - negative squre roots of the four eigenvalues of non - hermitian matrix @xmath54 with @xmath55 defined as @xmath56 .",
    "we depict the two - atom entanglement situation in fig . 2 - 4 in different parameter spaces ( @xmath38 , @xmath39 , @xmath44 , @xmath15 ) . in fig .",
    "2 , we adopt ( @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) for dotted line and ( @xmath58 , @xmath58 , @xmath61 , @xmath60 ) for solid line , then plot the entanglement versus time .",
    "firstly , we investigate the impact of next nearest - neighbour ( nnn ) atom pair on the entanglement of nearest - neighbour ( nn ) atom pair .",
    "we see from fig .",
    "2 that , the existence of nnn coupling damages the maximal entanglement of nn atom pair . fortunately",
    ", this coupling can be assigned to tend to zero so that it can be neglected . in doing so",
    ", the phase factor @xmath22 and @xmath24 is assumed to be equal , and phase factor @xmath62 is properly choosed so that @xmath44 is so much small compares with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this can be achieved by selecting special optical fiber . moreover , nnn coupling does not perturb the period of nn atoms entanglement .",
    "so , in utilizing two - atom entanglement , though the probability of entangling maybe affected under different fiber devices , the controlling time of maximal entanglement that is much important in many quantum information experiments@xcite should not be changed .",
    "because of the diversity of fiber path , the phase shift @xmath22 and @xmath63 could be easily perturbed . in fig .",
    "3 , we investigate the influence of nonuniform coupling on the nn entanglement . the parameter space is ( @xmath58 , @xmath64 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 ) with dotted line for atoms 1 - 2 and solid line for atoms 2 - 3 . under this circumstance ,",
    "three points should be stated : the general two - atom entanglement is reduced compared with that in fig .",
    "2 ; there appears a patial pressure effect for series connection , the nn atoms that have stronger coupling share larger entanglement ; the general entanglement period is restricted , thus the controlling time for maximal entanglement is compressed .",
    "so , in constructing physical quantum information channel for network , the fiber used from point ( atom - cavity ) to point ( atom - cavity ) is preferred to be identical even including dissipation on the fiber .    in fig .",
    "4 , we adopt larger @xmath48 than in fig . 2 - 3 to study the influence of the interaction between each atom and the local laser field on the nn atom entanglement .",
    "once the data bus constituted by fiber is contructed , the information channel will not be easily improved . while , fig .",
    "4 indicates that , the alternating of @xmath48 remarkably changes the nn atom entanglement .",
    "the period is further depressed , but the amount of entanglement is much enhanced compares with the former results . under the condition of small @xmath48 , as is pointed before , changing @xmath48 is in fact modulating the entanglement between nn atoms .",
    "what we paying attention to is entangment signals can be manually controlled through alternating @xmath65 .",
    "this kind of modulation effects of optical field on atoms or magnetic field on spins have already been concerned@xcite .",
    "certainly , the synchronization of @xmath48s in each local cavity is important for modulating the entanglement , the related discussion will be involved elsewhere .",
    "we have discussed the preparation of effective two - atom entanglement in a fiber connected triple - atom system . using input - output theory for lossing cavity , after tracing over the field variables",
    ", we treated the stationary system as a triple - body ising problem .",
    "the inversion of the particle number for two atomic levels was thus analogous with the polarization of electron spin .",
    "local laser fields were applied to generate and madulate the entanglement of two atoms .",
    "the fiber connected atoms is in fact a kind of data bus for such a simple multi - atom network , the general influence of which on the two - atom entanglement was studied .",
    "the phase shift of the photons in the fiber has been found to determine the interaction strength between two ising - kind sites .",
    "in addition , the dissipation of the photon information through the fiber should be investigated , while , the impact of dissipation can also be included in the intearaction strength but acts as a decaying exponential factor of the length of the fiber , in the form of @xmath66 , with @xmath67 the dissipation per unit length , @xmath68 the total length of the fiber .",
    "the local laser field plays a key role in modulating the entanglemnent properties .",
    "so , making an opportune choice between fiber and local laser field is optimal in generating such entanglement .",
    "certainly , a practically physical quantum network should be constituted by a large number of atoms@xcite .",
    "our system can be extended to one - dimension atomic chain or higher dimension systems .",
    "thus , they may ture out to be a candidate for constructing quantum information data - bus .",
    "fig . 1 : schematic diagram of the supposed system setup .",
    "three two - level atoms are located in spatially separated microcavities which are connected via optical fibers .",
    "two of the cavities are single - sided and one of them are double - sided ."
