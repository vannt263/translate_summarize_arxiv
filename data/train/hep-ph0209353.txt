    "in a hot , weakly coupled gauge theory , such as qcd at asymptotically high temperature where the running coupling @xmath1 is small , one might hope to achieve solid theoretical control over the dynamics of the theory .",
    "to date , however , very little has been derived about the dynamics of such theories at even _ leading order _ in the coupling  that is , neglecting all relative corrections to the leading weak - coupling behavior which are suppressed by powers of @xmath5 .",
    "for example , hydrodynamic transport properties such as shear viscosity , electrical conductivity , and flavor diffusion are not known at leading order ; they have only been calculated in a `` leading - log '' approximation , which has relative errors of order @xmath6 . but neglecting @xmath7 effects ] but , among other things , missed the `` @xmath4 '' collinear processes described in this paper , as well as pair annihilation / creation processes which contribute even at leading - log order . the latter have been previously discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] to study transport or equilibration processes in a hot plasma quantitatively , the most efficient approach is first to construct an effective kinetic theory which reproduces , to the required level of precision , the relevant dynamics of the underlying quantum field theory , and then apply this kinetic theory to the processes of interest .",
    "specifically , we would like to formulate an appropriate set of boltzmann equations which will , on sufficiently long time and distance scales , correctly describe the dynamics of typical ultrarelativistic excitations ( _ i.e. _ , quarks and gluons ) with sufficient accuracy to permit a correct leading - order evaluation of observables such as transport coefficients .",

    ", one does not actually need a general non - equilibrium ( and non - linear ) kinetic theory ; it is sufficient merely to have boltzmann equations linearized in small deviations away from an equilibrium state of given temperature @xmath0 .",
    "but more generally one would like to formulate a fully non - equilibrium kinetic theory which would also be applicable to systems ( such as intermediate stages of a heavy ion collision @xcite ) in which deviations from equilibrium are substantial and quantities such as temperature are not unambiguously defined .",
    "this will be our goal .",
    "it should be emphasized that all of our analysis assumes the theory is weakly coupled on the scales of interest .",

    "it is an open question to what extent this weak coupling analysis is applicable to real heavy ion collisions at accessible energies .",
    "however , we believe that understanding the dynamics in weakly coupled asymptotic regimes is a necessary and useful prerequisite to understanding dynamics in more strongly coupled regimes .",
    "the domain of applicability of any kinetic theory depends on the time scales of the underlying scattering processes which are approximated as instantaneous transitions in the collision term of the boltzmann equation . in the remainder of this introduction , we review the relevant scattering processes and associated time scales , describe the assumptions underlying our effective kinetic theory for near - equilibrium systems in which the temperature is at least locally well - defined , and then discuss how the required conditions can be generalized to a much wider class of non - equilibrium systems .",
