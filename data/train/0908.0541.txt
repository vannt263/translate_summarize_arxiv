    "ever since the famous arguments of einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) @xcite , quantum nonlocality has been a central issue for understanding the conceptual foundations of quantum mechanics .",
    "quantum nonlocality can be demonstrated by the violation of bell inequalities ( bis ) @xcite which are obeyed by local - realistic ( lr ) theories .",
    "realizations of bi tests are thus of great importance in testing the validity of quantum theories against lr theories .",
    "in addition , bi tests play a practical role in the detection of entanglement which is one of the main resources for quantum information processing .",
    "bell inequality tests for 2-dimensional systems have already been realized @xcite , while bi tests in higher - dimensional and continuous variable systems remain an active area of research @xcite .",
    "phase space representations are a convenient tool for the analysis of continuous variable states as they provide insights into the boundaries between quantum and classical physics .",
    "any quantum state @xmath0 can be fully characterized by the quasiprobability function defined in phase space @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the probability functions in classical phase space the quasiprobability function is not always positive .",
    "for example , the wigner - function of the single photon state has negative values in certain regions of phase space @xcite .",
    "since the negativity of the quasiprobability function inevitably reflects a non - classical feature of quantum states , the relation between negativity of quasi - probabilities and quantum nonlocality has been investigated @xcite .",
    "bell argued @xcite that the original epr state will not exhibit nonlocality since its wigner - function is positive everywhere and hence serves as a classical probability distribution for hidden variables . on the other hand , banaszek and wdkiewicz ( bw ) showed how to demonstrate quantum nonlocality using the q- and wigner - functions @xcite .",
    "they suggested two distinct types of bis , one of which is formulated via the q - function and referred to in this paper as the bw - q inequality while the other is formulated using the wigner - function and is referred to as the bw - w inequality .",
    "remarkably , the bw - w inequality was shown to be violated by the epr state @xcite .",
    "this indicates that there is no direct relation between the negativity of the wigner - function and nonlocality .",
    "quasiprobability functions can be parameterized by one real parameter @xmath1 @xcite @xmath2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 , and @xmath4 is the number state displaced by the complex variable @xmath5 in phase space .",
    "it is produced by applying the glauber displacement operator @xmath6 to the number state @xmath7 .",
    "we call @xmath8 the @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability function which becomes the p - function , the wigner - function , and the q - function when setting @xmath9 @xcite , respectively . for non - positive",
    "@xmath1 the function @xmath8 can be written as a convolution of the wigner - function and a gaussian weight @xmath10 this can be identified with a smoothed wigner - function affected by noise which is modeled by gaussian smoothing @xcite . therefore decreasing @xmath1 reduces the negativity of the wigner function and is thus often considered to be a loss of quantumness .",
    "for example , the q - function ( @xmath11 ) , which is positive everywhere in phase space , can be identified with the wigner function smoothed over the area of measurement uncertainty .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to propose a method for testing quantum nonlocality using the @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability function .",
    "we will firstly formulate a generalized bi in terms of the @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability function in sec .",
    "[ section : gbi ] . this will lead us to a _",
    "@xmath1-parameterized bell inequality _ which includes the bw - q and the bw - w inequalities as limiting cases . we will then present a measurement scheme to test bis using imperfect detectors in sec .",
    "[ section : tqn ] . the measured bell expectation value can be written as a function of the parameter @xmath1 and the overall detector efficiency @xmath12 . in sec .",
    "[ section : vsp ] violations of bis will be demonstrated for single - photon entangled states and in sec .  [ section : vtmss ] for two - mode squeezed vacuum states .",
    "we find the range of @xmath1 and @xmath12 which allows observing non - local properties of these two types of states .",
    "we will show that the test involving the q - function permits the lowest detector efficiency for observing violations of local realism .",
    "we also find that the degree of violation is irrespective of the negativity of the quasiprobability function .",
    "finally , in sec .  [ section : remarks ] , we discuss the characteristics and applications of the @xmath1-parameterized bi .",
    "we begin by formulating a generalised bi in terms of quasiprobability functions .",
    "suppose that two spatially separated parties , alice and bob , independently choose one of two observables , denoted by @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 respectively .",
    "no restriction is placed on the number of possible measurement outcomes ( which may be infinite ) .",
    "we assume that the measurement operators of the local observables @xmath17 can be written as @xmath18 using a hermitian operator @xmath19 parameterized by a real non - positive number @xmath1 and an arbitrary complex variable @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the identity operator .",
    "the possible measurement outcomes of @xmath21 are given by its eigenvalues , @xmath22 and their eigenvectors are the displaced number states .",
    "the maximum and minimum measurement outcomes of @xmath21 for any non - positive @xmath1 are @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "for @xmath25 we have @xmath26 , the displaced parity operator , while for @xmath11 we find that @xmath27 projects onto the coherent states .",
    "a bell operator can be constructed using the measurement operators @xmath28 , @xmath29 by way of a construction similar to the chsh combination @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the correlation operator . since the expectation values of the local observables are bounded by @xmath32 and @xmath33 for any non - positive @xmath1 , the expectation value of the bell operator defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bop ] ) is bounded by @xmath34 in lr theories .",
    "note that the expectation value of @xmath35 for a given density operator @xmath0 is proportional to the @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability function @xcite @xmath36\\\\    & = & \\frac{2}{\\pi(1-s)}\\sum^{\\infty}_{n=0}\\left(\\frac{s+1}{s-1}\\right)^n    \\bra{\\alpha , n}\\hat{\\rho } \\ket{\\alpha , n},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from which both the wigner function and the q - function can be recovered by setting @xmath25 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "we do not consider the case @xmath37 when the eigenvalues of @xmath38 are not bounded .",
    "we thus obtain the following generalised bi @xmath39+\\pi s(1-s)^2\\\\ \\nonumber    & \\times&[w(\\alpha_1;s)+w(\\beta_1;s)]+2s^2 \\biggr|    ~\\leq 2,\\\\\\\\ \\nonumber    |{\\cal b}|_{\\{s\\leq-1\\}}&= & |    \\pi^2(1-s)^2[w(\\alpha_1,\\beta_1;s)+w(\\alpha_1,\\beta_2;s)\\\\ \\nonumber    & + & w(\\alpha_2,\\beta_1;s)-w(\\alpha_2,\\beta_2;s)]-2\\pi(1-s)\\\\ \\nonumber    & \\times&[w(\\alpha_1;s)+w(\\beta_1;s)]+2| ~\\leq 2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 $ ] is the two - mode @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability functions , and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are its marginal distributions .",
    "we call eq .",
    "( [ eq : bfinqp ] ) the _ @xmath1-parameterized bell inequality _ for quasiprobability functions .",
    "this bi is equivalent to the bw - w inequality when @xmath25 which has the form of the standard chsh inequality @xcite , and the bw - q inequality when @xmath11 in the form of the bi proposed by clauser and horn ( ch ) @xcite . in these cases",
    "the corresponding generalized quasiprobability function reduces to the wigner - function @xmath43 and the q - function @xmath44 , respectively @xcite .",

    "the photon number detectors ( pnds ) have efficiency @xmath47.,scaledwidth=35.0% ]    in this section we present a scheme to test quantum nonlocality using the @xmath1-parameterized bis . for a valid quantum nonlocality test",
    "the measured quantities should satisfy the lr conditions which are assumed when deriving bis .",
    "thus we here employ the direct measurement scheme of quasiprobability functions using photon number detectors proposed in @xcite .",
    "a pair of entangled states generated from a source of correlated photons is distributed between alice and bob , each of whom make a local measurement by way of an unbalanced homodyne detection ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "each local measurement is carried out using a photon number detector with quantum efficiency @xmath47 preceded by a beam splitter with transmissivity @xmath46 .",
    "coherent fields @xmath48 and @xmath45 enter through the other input ports of each beam splitter . for high transmissivity @xmath49 and strong coherent fields @xmath50,@xmath51 , the beam splitters of alice and bob can be described by the displacement operators @xmath52 and @xmath53 respectively , where @xmath54 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "measurements @xmath56 with @xmath57 the photon number operator are performed on the outgoing modes using perfect photon number detectors .",
    "then the expectation value directly yields the value of the @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability function at the point in phase space specified by the complex variables @xmath5 and @xmath58 .",
    "for example , the wigner function can be obtained by the parity measurements @xmath59 ( @xmath25 ) and the q - function by on - off ( i.e. photon presence or absence ) measurements ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "let us now consider the effects of the detector efficiencies @xmath12 . if the true photon number distribution is given by @xmath60 , then the measured distribution can be written as a function of the overall detection efficiency @xmath61 as @xmath62 @xcite . for @xmath63",
    "the measured quasiprobability function is @xmath64 the @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability function measured by a detector with efficiency @xmath12 can therefore be identified with the quasiprobability function with parameter @xmath65 .",
    "other sources of noise ( e.g.  dark counts and mode mismatch ) could be included into this approach but are neglected here for simplicity .",
    "finally , the expectation value of observable ( [ eq : obop ] ) is given as @xmath66 where @xmath67 represents the expectation value obtained by measurement with efficiency @xmath12 .",
    "note that ( [ eq : expecob ] ) is the statistical average of directly measured data without postselection .",

    "( [ eq : bfinsw ] ) for @xmath25 and @xmath11 give the same results as tests of the bw - w and bw - q inequalities , respectively .",
    "for the single photon entangled state .",

    "this state is created by a single photon incident on a 50:50 beam splitter .",

    "( [ eq : qpofspes ] ) has negative values in certain regions of phase space but for @xmath11 it becomes the q - function @xmath77 .",
    "the maximum expectation values @xmath78 are obtained for properly chosen @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the range of parameters @xmath1 and detector efficiencies @xmath12 for which the bi is violated , @xmath83 .",
    "interestingly , the degree of violation is not directly related to the negativity of the quasiprobability functions .",
    "the test of the bi using the q - function ( @xmath11 ) yields strong violations and is most robust to detector inefficiencies .",
    "this is because the observable ( [ eq : obop ] ) becomes dichotomized at @xmath84 corresponding to detection of none vs.  some photons . for a given @xmath1 ,",
    "the amount of violation decreases with decreasing @xmath12 .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath12 indicates the required detector efficiency for a successful nonlocality test @xcite .",
    "for example , the minimum bound is about @xmath85 for the q - function ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "we also find the minimum parameter @xmath1 which allows demonstrating quantum nonlocality for a given detector efficiency .",
    "for example , for a perfect detector ( @xmath86 ) , the corresponding bi is violated when @xmath87 .",
    "we consider the two - mode squeezed vacuum states ( tmsss ) , i.e. a continuous variable entangled state written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the squeezing parameter .",
    "it can be realized for instance by non - degenerate optical parametric amplifiers @xcite . in the infinite squeezing limit @xmath90 ,",
    "the tmss becomes the normalized epr state which is the maximally entangled state associated with position and momentum @xcite .    for a non - positive @xmath1",
    "the quasiprobability function of the tmss is given by @xmath91 and its marginal single - mode distribution is @xmath92 where @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "note that these are positive everywhere in phase space . in fig .",
    "[ fig3](a ) violations of the @xmath1-parameterized bi are shown for tmsss .",
    "the test using the q - function ( @xmath11 ) is most robust with respect to detector inefficiencies .",
    "the amount of violation shows different tendencies depending on the squeezing parameter @xmath95 . in the case of low squeezing rates ,",
    "i.e.  when the amplitudes of small - n number states are dominant , the violation is maximal if we choose the q - function ( @xmath11 ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "this implies that the dominant contribution to the violation comes from correlations between the vacuum and photons being present . for larger squeezing rates @xmath96 , the violation reaches a maximal value @xmath97 when we test the wigner - function ( @xmath25 ) @xcite",
    "this indicates that the parity measurements are effective for verifying higher - order number correlations .",
    "however , the parity measurements require very high detector efficiency as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3](b ) .",
    "the range of @xmath1 within which one can demonstrate nonlocality becomes narrower around @xmath25 and @xmath11 with increasing squeezing rate @xmath95 .",
    "this is because the observable ( [ eq : obop ] ) is dichotomized at @xmath25 and @xmath11 .",
    "we demonstrated that quantum nonlocality has no direct relation to the negativity of @xmath1-parameterized quasiprobability functions .",
    "in fact the q - function ( @xmath11 ) which never becomes negative can still be used to verify non - local properties as we showed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] and yields strong violations of the corresponding bi .",
    "this implies that the quantum properties of nonlocality and negativity of the quasiprobability functions should be considered distinct features of quantum mechanics .",
    "furthermore we showed that the q - function test allows the lowest detector efficiency for demonstrating quantum nonlocality .",
    "for example , it requires only @xmath98% for a single photon entangled state and @xmath99% for tmsss with @xmath100 to detect nonlocality .",
    "this indicates that two - mode correlations between vacuum and many photons can be more robust to detector inefficiencies than correlations between vacuum and a single photon .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 determines the characteristics of the detected non - local correlations .",
    "for example , if we choose @xmath11 the violation of the bi exhibits only correlations between vacuum and photons . in order to test higher - order photon number correlations",
    "we need to increase @xmath1 to zero , so that the factor @xmath101 multiplied to the photon number probability increases in eq .",
    "( [ eq : top ] ) .",
    "although parity measurements ( @xmath25 ) allow to detect higher - order correlations effectively , they also require very high detector efficiencies as shown in fig .",
    "if we properly choose a certain parameter @xmath102 , e.g. @xmath103 , we can detect higher - order correlations with a lower detector efficiency than that required for testing the bi using the wigner function .",
    "however , we note that the violation of the bi with @xmath103 disappears with increasing squeezing rate as shown in fig .  [ fig3](b ) ; this restricts the possible applications to schemes using light that contains only a few photons .",
    "let us finally discuss whether we can regard decoherence effects as changes to @xmath1 .",
    "interactions with the environment and detection noise tend to smoothen quasiprobability functions .",
    "for example , when solving the fokker - planck equation for the evolution of the wigner - function of a system interacting with a thermal environment one obtains @xcite @xmath104 here the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath106 are given in terms of the energy decay rate @xmath107 , and @xmath108 is the wigner function for the thermal state of average thermal photon number @xmath109 .",
    "the effect of the thermal environment is then identified with temporal changes of the parameter @xmath110 therefore one might be tempted to consider an environment in a thermal state as giving rise to a temporal change in @xmath1 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : obop ] ) .",
    "however this idea is not applicable to tests of quantum nonlocality .",
    "the @xmath1-parameterized bi is derived for observables ( [ eq : obop ] ) which contain @xmath1 as a deterministic value of lr theories .",
    "thus the local - realistic bound is no longer valid when dynamical observables are considered ( even though they give the same statistical average ) .",
    "however , this idea might be useful for witnessing entanglement @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have formulated a bi in terms of the generalized quasiprobability function .",
    "this bi is parameterized by a non - positive value @xmath1 and includes previously proposed bis such as the bw - w ( @xmath25 ) and the bw - q ( @xmath11 ) inequalities @xcite .",
    "we employed a direct measurement scheme for quasiprobability functions @xcite to test quantum nonlocality .",
    "the violation of bis was demonstrated for two types of entangled states , single photon entangled and two - mode squeezed vacuum states .",
    "we found the range of @xmath1 and @xmath12 which allow the observation of quantum non - local properties .",
    "we discussed the types of correlations and their robustness to detection inefficiencies for different values of @xmath1 .",
    "we also demonstrated that the negativity of the quasiprobability function is not directly related to the violation of bis .",
    "the realization of @xmath1-parameterized bi tests is expected along with the progress of photon detection technologies @xcite in the near future .",
    "our investigations can readily be extended to other types of states like photon subtracted gaussian states @xcite , or optical schrdinger cat states @xcite .",
