    "if the topology of space - time is @xmath5 then the only known exact solution representing a black object is the uniform black string with horizon topology @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "though this solution exists for all values of the mass it is unstable below a critical value , @xmath7 , as shown by gregory and laflamme @xcite .",
    "horowitz and maeda @xcite argued that a uniform black string can not change its topology into a black hole in finite affine time , making the possibility of such a transition questionable .",
    "they suggested the possibility of a transition to a nonuniform black string .",
    "gubser @xcite showed the existence of nonuniform black string solutions .",
    "the non - uniform black string solution in 6 dimensions was investigated numerically @xcite for a range of the mass values above @xmath7 .",
    "nonuniform black string configurations do not exist for masses below the gregory - laflamme point , in the region where the uniform black string solution is unstable  @xcite .",
    "a natural candidate for a black object in this mass range is a black hole .",
    "unfortunately , no exact black hole solutions are known in a 5 ( or more ) dimensional space with a compactified dimension . still , on the basis of physical intuition , a black hole solution should exist for very small values of the mass .",
    "when the radius of the horizon is much smaller than the size of the compactified dimension , i.e. when @xmath8 , the black hole should be unaware of the compactification . then a myers - perry  @xcite solution should become asymtotically exact .",
    "indeed , a numerical solution , extending the myers - perry solution to larger values of the mass was found by harmark and obers  @xcite and kudoh and wiseman  @xcite .    using general arguments",
    "kol  @xcite suggested that the black hole branch and the nonuniform black string branch meet at a point when the black hole fills the compact dimension .",
    "further arguments for such a transition were presented in  @xcite .",
    "recently , we have studied a related problem , namely the existence of black holes in randall - sundrum  @xcite theories .",
    "we used  @xcite an approximation scheme based on the expansion of solutions in the ratio of the radius of the horizon of the black hole to the ads curvature . in this paper",
    "we employ a similar strategy by expanding the metric and other relevant quantities in the ratio of the two natural lengths associated with a black hole configuration , ( i ) the five dimensional schwarzschild radius , @xmath1 , associated with the mass @xmath9 and ( ii ) the compactification length , @xmath2 , defined as the proper circumference of the compact dimension in the region far away from the mass .",
    "the dimensionless ratio of these two quantities serves as an excellent expansion parameter . as the solution is an even function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 we use @xmath10 as our expansion parameter .",
    "such an expansion for add black holes has recently been proposed and harmark  @xcite and gorbonos and kol  @xcite evaluated the leading term of the expansion .    to find an unique solution we must fix boundary conditions , both at infinity and at the horizon of the black hole .",
    "we find solutions in two different regions . in the asymptotic region , @xmath11 an ` asymptotic solution ' , and in the near horizon region , @xmath12 a ` near solution ' is found .",
    "using the asymptotic solution we satisfy asymptotic boundary conditions but the boundary conditions at the horizon can not be satisfied .",
    "the near solution suffers from the opposite problem , as it can not be used to satisfy asymptotic boundary conditions . to solve those problems we combine the two solutions .",
    "we match the asymptotic solution with the near solution in the region @xmath13 where both are valid .",
    "this method was used in @xcite to find small black holes in randall - sundrum scenario , and in @xcite to find small black holes on cylinders .",
    "the work in this paper is parallel to and agrees with previous results   @xcite , but here we calculate the metric up to fourth order in @xmath14 ( second order in @xmath4 ) .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows : in section [ sec : method ] we describe the general method of our calculations , and list the parameters that will be calculated from the metric . in sections",
    "[ sec : zeroth]-[sec : second ] we present the detailed calculations up to second order . in section [ sec : summary ] we summarize our results for the metric , up to second order , and discuss the possible scenarios for black holes of increasing mass .",
    "a reader not interested in technical details should read the next section , ( [ sec : method ] ) and then proceed directly to the summary and discussions ( [ sec : summary ] ) .",
    "as we indicated in the introduction we will investigate black hole solutions of the einstein equation in 5 dimensional space when one of the dimensions is compactified .",
    "recently , this problem has attracted the attention of several groups .",
    "harmark and obers@xcite introduced the relative tension of black holes as an order parameter , wrote down a generalized smarr formula  @xcite , investigated the phase diagram for black objects , and studied the solutions numerically .",
    "gorbonos and kol  @xcite proposed an analytic approximation scheme based on the expansion in the ratio of the radius of the horizon and the compactification length .",
    "this method is similar to the expansion method we used  @xcite to investigate black holes in the randall - sundrum @xcite scenario .",
    "we will follow a similar path here and calculate further terms of the expansion .    by necessity",
    ", the perturbation method is applied in two overlapping regions . in the asymptotic region , @xmath11",
    ", @xmath1 is the smallest scale .",

'      in each region , when we calculate the @xmath20-th order terms , einstein s equations is solved in terms of two functions : a gauge function and a wave function , which satisfies a linear , ( inhomogeneous ) , master equation .",
    "the differential operator for the master equation in the asymptotic region is @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a coordinate in the compact dimension and @xmath23 is a radial coordinate in 3-dimensional space . in the near region",
    "the operator is @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a radial coordinate and @xmath26 is an angular coordinate in 4-dimensional space .",
    "the driving term in the master equation for the @xmath20th order contribution depends on the solution in lower orders .",
    "it determines an inhomogeneous solution in the wave function .",
    "the additional homogeneous solution introduces new parameters that should be fixed by boundary conditions .      in empty space , or for the uniform black string configuration ,",
    "the cylinder is invariant under translations in the compact direction .",
    "when a point mass is introduced translation invariance is broken , but a @xmath27 reflection symmetry remains around the location of the mass in the compact direction .",

    "asymptotically ( far away from the mass ) , we assume that the metric is minkowski .",
    "the leading order correction to the minkowski metric is of order @xmath31 . such a term provides , among others , the four - dimensional newtonian potential .",

    "we require that there is no black string attached to the horizon .",
    "consequently , the kretchmann scalar must be regular on the @xmath22 axis everywhere , when @xmath33 .",
    "furthermore , the surface gravity must be constant , otherwise the horizon is not regular  @xcite .      to match the asymptotic and the near solutions we must work in the intermediate region @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a four - space - dimensional radial coordinate . in this region the functions",
    "@xmath36 can be expanded in the coordinates .",
    "owing to the @xmath37 symmetry the components depend only on @xmath35 and @xmath26 , the angle between the compact direction and the four - dimensional sub - manifold",
    ". then one can use a double expansion in @xmath38 and @xmath39 to write the metric as @xmath40 the expansion includes only even powers due to the @xmath27-symmetry as will be explained later .",

    "@xmath4 has a different meaning .",
    "the asymptotic solution is constructed as an expansion in @xmath1 , such that @xmath42 , so one keeps @xmath20 constant and solves the equations for all values of @xmath43 .",

    "minkowski metric corresponds to the zeroth order ( @xmath44 , @xmath45 ) approximation to our problem , with appropriate coefficients , @xmath46 .",

    "we will see a further indication for this point in another , independent , calculation of the critical value of @xmath4 .",
    "the apparent agreement of @xmath306 with @xmath307 ( equality of the entropies of the uniform black string and the black hole ) is somewhat problematic .",
    "we see no mathematical reason for such a agreement , though it would be interesting if these points also coincided .",
    "note that for geometric reasons the black hole branch should cease to exist above the critical value of @xmath4 so the stable state of the system is the uniform black string , which has a higher entropy than the nonuniform black string .      in terms of the coordinates we chose the horizon",
    "is located at constant @xmath35 . however , this does not mean it is spherical .",
    "compactification breaks the @xmath308 symmetry .",
    "the horizon can be an oblate ( elongated perpendicular to the compact direction ) or a prolate ( elongated parallel to the compact dimension ) ellipsoid .",
    "there is no generally accepted method for distinguishing between the oblate and the prolate configurations .",
    "some authors @xcite define the eccentricity of the black hole as @xmath309 where @xmath310 is the maximal area of a cross section of the horizon parallel to the compact dimension , and @xmath311 is the maximal area of a cross section of the horizon perpendicular to the compact dimension . @xmath312",
    "a prolate ( oblate ) horizon has positive ( negative ) eccentricity .",
    "we use the near solution ( [ emetric2 ] ) to find that @xmath313 .",
    "we see that the horizon is prolate .",
    "another possible measure of the eccentricity is given by the intrinsic ricci scalar of the horizon , which is calculated in terms of the three metric @xmath314      ~.\\label{horizonmetric}\\ ] ] using the near solution , the intrinsic curvature of ( [ horizonmetric ] ) is @xmath315~.\\label{intrinsicr}\\ ] ] it is maximal at @xmath134 , which indicates that the horizon is indeed prolate .",
    "one might speculate that a prolate horizon will tend to grow in the periodic direction and turn into a nonuniform black string .",
    "however , the circumference of the compact direction grows as well  @xcite and the transition into a black string is not obvious . in @xcite",
    "it is suggested to measure the inter polar distance , which is the proper distance between the poles of the prolate horizon along the compact dimension . in principle , to calculate this distance we need to break the integral defining this distance into two parts . in the first part we should use the near solution and in the other we should use the asymptotic solution . in the near horizon region",
    "one should integrate along @xmath134 from @xmath147 to some arbitrary point @xmath316 . in the asymptotic region",
    "we should integrate along @xmath317 from @xmath318 to @xmath319 @xmath320 in @xcite it was found that the zeroth order approximation is @xmath321 , which means that the circumference grows enough to make room for the black hole .",
    "if the mass ( @xmath4 ) value , at which the black hole fills the compact dimension , is small enough then it is possible that the integral over the near solution is sufficient in ( [ lpoles ] ) , or , in other words , we can choose @xmath322 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath323 first of all , we see that the distance between the poles of the horizon is a decreasing function of @xmath4 .",
    "if we solve the equation @xmath324 we obtain @xmath325 , which is in a rough agreement with values we obtained for the critical value , @xmath326 , above . taking the first order term only we would obtain @xmath327 . clearly , the convergence of @xmath328 is not as good as those of @xmath326 and @xmath306 .",
    "one reason for the poorer convergence is that for very small @xmath4 ( [ lpoles2 ] ) must fail , as a significant contribution coming from the asymptotic solution was omitted .",
    "it should work , however in the region where @xmath329 .",
    "fortunately , in this region the @xmath4-expansion is still fairly reliable and the rough agreement of @xmath330 is encouraging .",
