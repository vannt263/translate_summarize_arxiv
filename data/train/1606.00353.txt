    "shelves , racks and quandles are algebraic structures whose axioms come from reidemeister moves in knot theory .",
    "the earliest known work on racks is contained in the 1959 correspondence between john conway and gavin wraith @xcite who studied racks in the context of the conjugation operation in a group . around 1982 , the notion of a quandle was introduced independently by joyce @xcite and matveev @xcite .",
    "they used it to construct representations of braid groups .",
    "joyce and matveev associated to each knot a quandle that determines the knot up to isotopy and mirror image . since then quandles and racks have been investigated by topologists in order to construct knot and link invariants , see @xcite for more details .",
    "quandles also can be investigated on their own right as non - associative algebraic structures . +",
    "a hom - algebra structure is a multiplication on a vector space where the structure is twisted by some map .",
    "thus any algebraic structure defined by axioms can be twisted to give a new generalization of the structure .",
    "the former structure can be then seen as a specialization of the later when the map is the identity .",
    "an example is the hom - lie algebras which were introduced in @xcite with the goal of studying the deformations of witt algebra , which is the complex lie algebra of derivations of the laurent polynomials in one variable , and the deformation of the virasoro algebra , a one - dimensional central extension of witt algebra . since then hom - structures in different settings ( algebras , coalgebras , hopf algebras , leibniz algebras , @xmath1-ary algebras , etc . )",
    "were investigated by many authors ( see for example @xcite ) . in this article",
    ", we apply this principle of twisting the algebraic equations to the context of quandles to obtain a notion of @xmath0-quandle .",
