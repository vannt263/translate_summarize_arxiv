    "given a completely multiplicative function @xmath0 , which takes on the values @xmath1 , and which has the property that @xmath6 one might wonder how often @xmath0 changes sign .",
    "that is , for how many integers @xmath4 is @xmath7 ?    it is a rather simple matter to prove that the number of @xmath4 with @xmath8 is @xmath9",
    ": by the pigeonhole principle , one can see that there exist @xmath10 or @xmath11 , with @xmath12 , such that there are @xmath9 integers @xmath13 with @xmath14 . then , since @xmath15 , and since @xmath16 , each such @xmath17 gives rise to an @xmath4 with @xmath8 .    despite how similar these two problems seem ( counting @xmath18 s satisfying @xmath8 , and counting @xmath18 s satisfying @xmath7 ) , it is an incomparably more difficult problem to show that @xmath7 for @xmath9 integers @xmath4 .",
    "even so , there has been some progress on this question in the past decade or so .",
    "for instance , harman , pintz and wolke ( see @xcite ) proved that for @xmath19 ( the liouville function ) , @xmath20 in @xcite , a. hildebrand proved the following bound for general completely multiplicative functions @xmath21 , which gives a much better answer for infinitely many @xmath2 : @xmath22 perhaps the methods of hildebrand can be used to replace the `` limsup '' with a `` lim '' , and thereby give a stronger result than our theorem [ main_theorem ] below .    in this paper , we prove the following result , which generalizes the result of harman , pintz , and wolke ( although the lower bound we give is not as sharp as the one they derive for @xmath23 ) :    [ main_theorem ] suppose that @xmath0 is a completely multiplicative function which takes on the values @xmath1 , and suppose that @xmath24 then , for @xmath2 sufficiently large , @xmath25 where @xmath26 .",
    "* remark : * we could perhaps improve the @xmath27 to @xmath28 for some constant @xmath29 ; however , improving the @xmath30 to @xmath31 for arbitrary @xmath32 seems to require some new ideas .",
    "the bottleneck to obtaining such results , using the method in this paper , is the fact that lemma [ prop_2_smooth_lemma ] only holds with @xmath33 .",
    "if one could prove that this lemma holds for @xmath34 , for some @xmath35 , then one could prove an estimate of the same quality as ( [ liouville_bound ] ) , but with @xmath36 replaced with some constant @xmath37 .",
    "the method of proof of the theorem is apparently new , and proceeds by showing that @xmath38 where @xmath39 are some pair of primes with @xmath40 . for each such @xmath18",
    "counted , we will have that @xmath41 ; and so , since @xmath42 and @xmath43 lie in @xmath44 $ ] , we deduce that this interval contains an integer @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "we show that if ( [ oscillate_discuss ] ) fails to hold for all such primes @xmath47 and @xmath48 above , then @xmath49 for all real numbers @xmath50 in a certain short ( but not too short ) interval near @xmath51 .",
    "showing that ( [ alpha_bound ] ) can not hold , for all such @xmath50 considered , is a relatively simple task , and can be proved by integrating the left hand side of ( [ alpha_bound ] ) over all such @xmath50 , and then showing that this integral can not be too small .",
    "for a given @xmath52 , let @xmath53 denote the interval @xmath54 $ ] , where @xmath55 for a given positive real number @xmath50 , let @xmath56    let @xmath57 be the set of all rational numbers @xmath58 where @xmath59 , and where @xmath60 are primes @xmath61 , with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "we note that @xmath57 contains the number @xmath51 .",
    "the proof of the main theorem will follow from the following two propositions :    [ prop_1 ] if @xmath2 is sufficiently large , and if there exists @xmath64 such that @xmath65 then ( [ main_consequence ] ) holds .",
    "[ prop_2 ] for all @xmath2 sufficiently large , there exists @xmath66 such that @xmath67    let @xmath68 satisfy the conclusion to this last proposition ( we assume @xmath2 is sufficiently large ) .",
    "thus , ( [ translation_inequality2 ] ) holds for @xmath69 . by proposition [ prop_1 ] ,",
    "( [ main_consequence ] ) holds , and theorem [ main_theorem ] is proved .",
    "we will prove the contrapositive of this proposition .",
    "so , suppose that ( [ main_consequence ] ) fails to hold .",
    "we will show that the hypothesis of the proposition is false .    in this proof and in later results",
    "we will need the following lemma and its corollaries :    [ shift_lemma ] if ( [ main_consequence ] ) fails to hold ( for a particular value of @xmath2 ) , and if @xmath70 is any integer - valued function of @xmath18 satisfying @xmath71 , then @xmath72    for each @xmath73 $ ] where @xmath74 , the interval @xmath75 $ ] ( or @xmath76 $ ] if @xmath77 ) contains consecutive integers @xmath78 such that @xmath46 .",
    "thus , the left hand side of ( [ shift_equation ] ) is bounded from above by @xmath79 as claimed .",
    "an immediate corollary of this lemma is as follows :    [ shift_corollary ] if ( [ main_consequence ] ) fails to hold , then for any integer @xmath80 and real number @xmath81 , @xmath82    we note that the first inequality of this lemma follows since for each integer @xmath83 , there are at most @xmath84 integers @xmath18 such that @xmath85 ( and note that @xmath86 ) ; and , the second inequality is an immediate consequence of lemma [ shift_lemma ] , since @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "finally , we have one more corollary :    [ shift_corollary2 ] for @xmath2 sufficiently large , if ( [ main_consequence ] ) fails to hold , and if @xmath89 are primes with @xmath40 and @xmath90 , then @xmath91    to prove this corollary we have from the triangle inequality , from the above lemma and corollary , and from the fact that @xmath92 for @xmath83 , @xmath93 for @xmath2 sufficiently large , which proves the corollary .",
    "suppose that @xmath64 is arbitrary ; we may write it as @xmath94 and where @xmath95 and @xmath96 are primes satisfying @xmath63 .",
    "in addition , we may assume that @xmath97 for all @xmath98 ; that is , through a simple induction argument , one can show that there exists some permutation @xmath99 of @xmath100 , such that @xmath101 , for @xmath102 .",
    "we will show that our assumption that ( [ main_consequence ] ) fails to hold implies @xmath103 such an inequality , if true , implies that ( [ translation_inequality2 ] ) fails to hold ( since @xmath104 , where @xmath95 ) ; and so , since @xmath64 was arbitrary , we could conclude that ( [ translation_inequality2 ] ) fails to hold for all @xmath64 , which would prove ( the contrapositive of ) our proposition .    to see that ( [ alpha_induction ] ) holds , we first note that it holds for @xmath105 , since this follows from corollary [ shift_corollary2 ] .",
    "now suppose that , for proof by induction , ( [ alpha_induction ] ) holds for @xmath106 .",
    "thus , @xmath107 we will show below that for @xmath2 sufficiently large , if @xmath83 , then @xmath108 and so , from this and our induction hypothesis we will have @xmath109 which proves the induction step ( that is , ( [ alpha_induction ] ) holds for @xmath110 ) , and so ( [ alpha_induction ] ) follows for @xmath98 .    finally , we have from the triangle inequality and corollary [ shift_corollary ] that for @xmath2 sufficiently large , the left hand side of ( [ difference_inequality ] ) is bounded from above by @xmath111 as claimed .",
    "let @xmath112 and @xmath57 be as in the section [ main_theorem_section ] .",
    "we will need the following two results to prove proposition [ prop_2 ] ( which are proved in section [ lemma_section ] ) :    [ prop_2_smooth_lemma ] for @xmath2 sufficiently large and for any pair of real numbers @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 there exists @xmath115 with @xmath116 $ ] .",
    "[ prop_2_lemma_2 ] for @xmath2 sufficiently large there exists a real number @xmath117 , such that @xmath118    to prove proposition [ prop_2 ] , suppose that @xmath2 is sufficiently large so that we can apply lemma [ prop_2_lemma_2 ] , and let @xmath119 be as appears there .",
    "if @xmath120 for some integer @xmath4 , then set @xmath121 and @xmath122 ; otherwise , if @xmath123 , for any integer @xmath4 ( and some integer @xmath124 ) , then we let @xmath125 be such that @xmath126 $ ] , @xmath127 , and @xmath128 $ ] contains no rationals of the form @xmath129 , @xmath4 .",
    "we claim that for such @xmath130 and @xmath131 , we will have that for any @xmath132 $ ] , @xmath133 and so , for any such @xmath134 , this gives @xmath135 since @xmath127 , from lemma [ prop_2_smooth_lemma ] we have that there exists @xmath136 $ ] , and so taking @xmath137 in ( [ equality_sigma ] ) , we deduce @xmath138",
    "proof of lemma [ prop_2_smooth_lemma ] .    to prove the lemma , we will construct a sequence of rational numbers @xmath139 where @xmath140 and where each @xmath141 is of the form @xmath142 and where @xmath143 .",
    "it is evident that @xmath144 for @xmath2 sufficiently large , since ( [ alpha_i_chain ] ) and ( [ alpha_i_inequality ] ) give us that @xmath145    if we had such a collection of @xmath141 s , we claim that we could product together ( the product can contain repeats ) some of them , to produce a close rational approximation to @xmath146 ; moreover , this product will itself lie in @xmath57 . to find such a product , we iterate the following algorithm :",
    "let us assume for now that the algorithm terminates .",
    "then , if we let @xmath155 be the product of all the @xmath141 s we divide by each time the algorithm executes step 3 , in passing from @xmath156 to @xmath157 , we will have that @xmath158 and so , since @xmath159 we will have that @xmath160 , which gives us that @xmath116 $ ] . now , in proving that the algorithm above halts , we will show that @xmath161 ; and so , if we expand out @xmath162 in terms of a ratio of products of primes ( by expanding each @xmath163 as such a product ) , we will have @xmath164 and @xmath165 , @xmath166 , and @xmath167 .",
    "thus , we will have @xmath115 , and the lemma will follow .",
    "let us now see that the above algorithm halts with @xmath168 : we will show by induction that if @xmath169 ( where @xmath170 ) , then the algorithm halts with @xmath171 .",
    "this clearly holds for @xmath172 , since in this case , the above algorithm halts after the first pass , giving @xmath173 .",
    "suppose that , for proof by induction , the algorithm halts with @xmath174 for all @xmath156 satisyfing @xmath169 , where @xmath175 .",
    "now , if @xmath156 is such that @xmath176 , then the algorithm will repeatedly divide by @xmath177 in step 3 , say it divides @xmath178 times , until @xmath179 .",
    "since the @xmath141 s satisfy ( [ alpha_i_inequality ] ) , we will have that @xmath180 .",
    "we also have that @xmath181 ; and therefore , @xmath182 , where @xmath183 . by the induction hypothesis",
    ", we will have that @xmath184 ( start the algorithm with @xmath156 equal to this number @xmath185 ) ; so , the algorithm will halt with @xmath186 , since @xmath187 , and so the induction step is proved .",
    "to finish the proof of the lemma , we must prove that the @xmath141 s exist : suppose that , for proof by induction , we have constructed the numbers @xmath188 .",
    "let @xmath189 .",
    "we will show that there exists integers @xmath190 , such that @xmath191 , which will give @xmath192 moreover , @xmath193 and @xmath194 will each be expressible as @xmath195 where @xmath63 and for @xmath196 , @xmath197 one can easily check that for @xmath2 sufficiently large @xmath198 ( this follows from ( [ alpha_i_chain ] ) and ( [ alpha_i_inequality ] ) , which give that @xmath199 ) , @xmath200 , and that @xmath62 .",
    "thus , @xmath201 with @xmath143 as claimed ; and so , letting @xmath202 will prove the induction step above , giving that the @xmath141 s exist .",
    "we are left to prove that @xmath193 and @xmath194 exist : let @xmath203 denote the set of all integers which can be written as @xmath204 , where @xmath205 $ ] is prime .",
    "we note that all these primes are @xmath61 , and all such products lie in @xmath206 $ ] .",
    "also , by the pigeonhole principle , there exists a subset @xmath207 , with @xmath208 , and a constant @xmath209 , such that if @xmath210 has prime factorization @xmath204 , then exactly @xmath211 of these prime factors @xmath212 ( counting repeats ) will have @xmath213 ( and so , @xmath214 factors @xmath215 will have @xmath216 ) .",
    "thus , for any pair of numbers @xmath217 , we can arrange their prime factorizations so that @xmath218 thus , to prove that @xmath219 exist , it suffices to show that @xmath220 ( since this implies there are at least two elements of @xmath221 $ ] which are at most @xmath222 apart ) : by the prime number theorem , for @xmath2 sufficiently large there are @xmath223 primes in @xmath224 ; and so , by some elementary combinatorics and the bounds @xmath198 , @xmath225 , and @xmath226 , we get @xmath227 the lemma now follows ."
