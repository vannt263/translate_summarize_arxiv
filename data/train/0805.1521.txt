    "recent work with lattice gauge theory simulations has attempted to map out the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in temperature and baryo - chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) using finite values of the up and down quark masses .",
    "the results of these studies indicate that the qcd phase diagram may contain a first - order transition line between the hadron gas phase and the strongly - coupled quark - gluon plasma ( sqgp ) phase that terminates at a critical point @xcite .",
    "this property is analogous to that observed in the phase diagram for many common liquids and other substances , including water .",
    "however , different model predictions and lattice calculations yield widely varying estimates of the location of the critical point on the qcd phase diagram @xcite .",
    "direct experimental observation of critical phenomena in heavy ion collisions would confirm the existence of the critical point , narrow down its location on the qcd phase diagram , and provide an important constraint for the qcd models .",
    "the estimated value of energy densities achieved in heavy ion collisions at the brookhaven national laboratory s relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) exceeds the threshold for a phase transition from normal hadronic matter to partonic matter .",
    "recent experimental evidence indicates that properties of the matter being produced include strong collective flow and large opacity to scattered quarks and gluons - the matter appears to behave much like a perfect fluid @xcite . while measurements suggest the produced matter has properties that differ from normal nuclear matter , unambiguous evidence of the nature and location of any phase transition from normal nuclear matter has been elusive thus far .",
    "described here is a search for direct evidence of a phase transition by measuring the fluctuations of the event - by - event multiplicities of produced charge particles in a variety of collision systems .    in order to illustrate how the measurement of charged particle multiplicity fluctuations can be sensitive to the presence of a phase transition",
    ", the isothermal compressibility of the system can be considered @xcite .",
    "the isothermal compressibility is defined as follows : @xmath2    where v is the volume , t is the temperature , and p is the pressure of the system . in order to relate the compressibility to measurements of multiplicity fluctuations",
    ", we assume that relativistic nucleus - nucleus collisions can be described as a thermal system in the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) @xcite .",
    "the gce can be applied to the case of measurements near mid - rapidity since energy and conserved quantum numbers in this region can be exchanged with the rest of the system , that serves as a heat bath @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of multiplicity fluctuations in the canonical and microcanonical ensembles with the application of conservation laws can be found elsewhere @xcite . in the gce ,",
    "the isothermal compressibility is directly related to the variance of the particle multiplicity as follows : @xmath3 where n is the particle multiplicity , @xmath4 is the mean multiplicity , and @xmath5 is boltzmann s constant @xcite . here",
    ", multiplicity fluctuation measurements are presented in terms of the scaled variance ,",
    "@xmath6 : @xmath7 in a continuous , or second - order , phase transition , the compressibility diverges to an infinite value at the critical point .",
    "near the critical point , this divergence is described by a power law in the variable @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the critical temperature .",
    "hence , the relationship between multiplicity fluctuations and the compressibility can be exploited to search for a clear signature of critical behavior by looking for the expected power law scaling of the compressibility : @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the critical exponent for isothermal compressibility @xcite .",
    "if the qcd phase diagram contains a critical point , systems with a low value of baryo - chemical potential ( @xmath1 ) could pass through the cross - over region and undergo a continuous phase transition @xcite .",
    "recent estimates @xcite of the behavior of the quark number susceptibility , @xmath12 , which is proportional to the value of the isothermal compressibility of the system , predict that its value will increase by at least an order of magnitude close to the qcd critical point .",
    "given that the scaled variance is proportional to @xmath13 , measurements of charged particle multiplicity are expected to be a sensitive probe for critical behavior .",
    "in addition , within a scenario where droplets of quark - gluon plasma are formed during a first - order phase transition , the scaled variance of the multiplicity could increase by a factor of 10 - 100 @xcite .",
    "experimentally , a search for critical behavior is facilitated by the rich and varied dataset provided by rhic .",
    "it is expected that the trajectory of the colliding system in the qcd phase diagram can be modified by varying the colliding energy @xcite .",
    "if the system approaches close enough to the critical line for a long enough time period , then critical phenomena could be readily apparent through the measurement of multiplicity fluctuations @xcite .",
    "it may also be possible to determine the critical exponents of the system .",
    "nature tends to group materials into universality classes whereby all materials in the same universality class share identical values for their set of critical exponents .",
    "although beyond the scope of this analysis , observation of critical behavior in heavy ion collisions and the subsequent measurement of the critical exponents could determine the universality class in which qcd is grouped , providing essential constraints for the models .",
    "charged particle multiplicity fluctuations have been measured in elementary collisions over a large range of collisions energies @xcite .",
    "initial measurements of multiplicity fluctuations in minimum - bias o+cu collisions at @xmath0=4.86 gev were made by bnl experiment e802 @xcite , minimum - bias o+au collisions at @xmath14=17.3 gev by cern experiment wa80 @xcite and minimum - bias s+s , o+au , and s+au collisions at @xmath0=17.3 gev by cern experiment na35 @xcite .",
    "recently , larger datasets have enabled the measurement of the centrality - dependence of multiplicity fluctuations in pb+pb collisions at @xmath0=17.3 gev by cern experiment wa98 @xcite and in pb+pb , c+c , and si+si collisions at @xmath0=17.3 gev by cern experiment na49 @xcite .",
    "the phenix experiment at rhic has performed an analysis of density correlations in longitudinal space with a differential analysis of charged particle multiplicity fluctuations in 200 gev au+au collisions over the entire transverse momentum range @xcite .",
    "thus far , the fluctuation measurements in heavy ion collisions do not indicate significant signs of a phase transition .",
    "however , the full range of collision energies and species accessible by rhic are yet to be explored .",
    "presented here is a comprehensive survey of multiplicity fluctuations of charged hadrons measured by the phenix experiment at rhic .",
    "the survey will cover the following collision systems : @xmath0=200 gev au+au , 62.4 gev au+au , 200 gev cu+cu , 62.4 gev cu+cu , and 22.5 gev cu+cu with comparisons to @xmath15=200 gev p+p collisions , which serve as a baseline measurement .",
    "the au+au data were taken during rhic run-4 ( 2004 ) , the cu+cu data were taken during rhic run-5 ( 2005 ) , and the p+p data were taken during rhic run-3 ( 2003 ) .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations for each collision system with the exception of p+p will also be presented as a function of centrality to help select the system volume .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations will also be presented as a function of transverse momentum range , and charge sign .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : sec .",
    "ii will discuss the experimental apparatus and details ; sec .",
    "iii will discuss the methods applied for the measurement of multiplicity fluctuations and the removal of non - dynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations of the collision geometry within a centrality bin ; sec .",

    "the phenix detector consists of two central spectrometer arms designed for charged particle tracking , designated east and west , and two muon spectrometers designed for muon tracking and identification , designated north and south .",
    "the muon spectrometers are not used in this analysis .",
    "a comprehensive description of the phenix detector is documented elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the analysis described here utilizes the central spectrometer arms , which consist of a set of tracking detectors @xcite , particle identification detectors @xcite , and an electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite . the central spectrometer arms cover a rapidity range of @xmath16 and each arm subtends 90 degrees in azimuth .",
    "a detailed description of the algorithms and performance of the central arm track reconstruction and momentum reconstruction can be found in @xcite .",
    "there are two detectors that are used for triggering , centrality determination , and event vertex determination .",
    "the beam - beam counters ( bbcs ) consist of 64 individual quartz cherenkov counters that cover the full azimuthal angle in the pseudorapidity range @xmath17 .",
    "the zero degree calorimeters ( zdcs ) cover the pseudorapidity range @xmath18 and measure the energy of spectator neutrons with an energy resolution of approximately 20% .",
    "more details about these detectors can be found in @xcite .",
    "the collision vertex position is determined using timing information from the bbcs with an r.m.s .",
    "resolution for central au+au events of 6 mm along the beam axis .",
    "the collision vertex is required to be reconstructed within @xmath1930 cm from the center of the spectrometer .",
    "the bbcs also provide a minimum biased ( mb ) event trigger .",
    "due to the large dynamic range in @xmath0 covered by this analysis , it is necessary to implement algorithms that are dependent on the collision energy for the determination of the centrality of each event . in au+au collisions at @xmath0=200 gev ,",
    "the centrality of the collision is determined by using correlations of the total energy deposited in the zdcs with the total charge deposited in the bbcs as described in @xcite . however , in 200 gev cu+cu , 62.4 gev cu+cu , and 62.4 gev au+au collisions , the resolving power of the zdcs is insufficient to significantly contribute to the centrality definition .",
    "therefore , only the total charge deposited in the bbcs is used to determine centrality in these collision systems , as described in @xcite . using the 200 gev au+au data",
    ", it has been verified that application of the bbc - zdc correlation for the centrality definition as opposed to the bbc - only definition shows no significant differences in the values of the charged hadron fluctuation quantities presented here as a function of centrality .",
    "the location of the bbcs are fixed for every collision energy . at the lowest collision energy ( @xmath0=22.5 gev ) , it becomes kinematically possible for spectator nucleons to fall within the acceptance of the bbc .",
    "this results in a bbc response in its total charge sum that is no longer linear with the number of participating nucleons ( @xmath20 ) . in this case",
    ", it becomes necessary to define the centrality using the total charged particle multiplicity in pad chamber 1 ( pc1 ) @xcite .",
    "pc1 is chosen due to its fine segmentation , high tracking efficiency , and relative proximity to the event vertex .",
    "details on this procedure are also described in @xcite . for all collision species and energies ,",
    "the distribution of the number of participants was determined using a monte carlo simulation based upon the glauber model @xcite .",
    "the number of minimum bias events analyzed for each dataset are 25.6 million events for 200 gev au+au , 24.9 million events for 62.4 gev au+au , 15.0 million events for 200 gev cu+cu , 12.2 million events for 62.4 gev cu+cu , 5.5 million events for 22.5 gev cu+cu , and 2.7 million events for 200 gev p+p .",
    "only a fraction of the complete 200 gev au+au , cu+cu , and p+p datasets are analyzed , but this fraction is more than sufficient for this analysis .    the charged particle multiplicity is determined on an event - by - event basis by counting the number of unambiguous reconstructed tracks in the drift chamber originating from the collision vertex that have corresponding hits in pad chamber 1 and pad chamber 3 .",
    "track selection includes cuts on reconstructed tracks in the drift chamber to reduce double - counted ghost tracks to a negligible level . in order to minimize background originating from the magnets , reconstructed tracks",
    "are required to lie within @xmath1975 cm from the center of the drift chamber along the beam axis .",
    "this requirement reduces the pseudorapidity range of reconstructed tracks to @xmath210.26 . the ring imaging cherenkov detector ( rich )",
    "is utilized to reduce background from electrons resulting from photon conversions .",
    "although the central arm spectrometer covers a total azimuthal range of @xmath22 radians , detector and tracking inefficiencies reduce the effective average azimuthal active area to 2.1 radians for the 200 gev au+au and 200 gev p+p datasets , and 2.0 radians for the other datasets .",
    "fluctuation quantities are quoted for these acceptances separately for each dataset .",
    "the differences in acceptance between datasets , which are due to variations in the detector over the three year period in which the data was collected , result in less than a 1% variation in the fluctuation quantities quoted here .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations of charged particles , designated @xmath23 , can be generally defined @xcite as follows : @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the charged particle multiplicity",
    ". simply stated , the fluctuations can be quoted as the variance of the multiplicity ( @xmath26 ) normalized by the mean ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "this is also referred to as the scaled variance @xcite .",
    "if the multiplicity distribution is poissonian , the scaled variance is 1.0 .",
    "it has been well established that charged particle multiplicity distributions in elementary nucleon - nucleon collisions can be described by the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) @xcite .",
    "the nbd also well describes multiplicity distributions in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the negative binomial distribution of an integer @xmath28 is defined as follows : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is normalized to 1.0 over the range @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is an additional parameter .",
    "the nbd reduces to a poisson distribution in the limit @xmath34 .",
    "the nbd variance and mean is related to @xmath33 as follows : @xmath35 hence , the scaled variance is given by @xmath36    a useful property of the negative binomial distribution concerns its behavior when a population that follows the nbd is subdivided randomly by repeated independent trials with a constant probability onto smaller subsets .",
    "this results in a binomial decomposition of the original population into subsets that also follow the nbd with the same value of @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "this property can be applied to estimate the behavior of multiplicity fluctuations as a function of acceptance , assuming that there are no significant correlations present over the acceptance range being examined . starting with an original nbd sample with mean @xmath37 and",
    "scaled variance @xmath23 , a sample in a fractional acceptance with mean @xmath38 is also described by an nbd distribution .",
    "an acceptance fraction can be defined as @xmath39 .",
    "the scaled variance of the subsample from equation ( [ eq : omegak ] ) is thus @xmath40 since @xmath33 is identical for the two samples , @xmath41 can be substituted , yielding the following relation between the scaled variances of the original and fractional acceptance samples : @xmath42 thus , the measured scaled variance will decrease as the acceptance is decreased while @xmath33 remains constant , if there are no additional correlations present over the given acceptance range .    figures  [ fig : nbdauau]-[fig : nbdcucu ] show the uncorrected , or raw , multiplicity distributions in the @xmath43 range @xmath44 gev for all centralities from each collision system overlayed with fits to negative binomial distributions ( dashed lines ) . for presentation purposes ,",
    "the data have been normalized on the horizontal axis by the mean of the distribution and scaled on the vertical axis by the successive amounts stated in the legend .",
    "the nbd fits describe the data distributions very well for all collision systems , centralities , and @xmath43 ranges .",
    "hence , the mean and variance of the multiplicity distributions presented here are all extracted from nbd fits .",
    "the results of each fit for @xmath44 gev are compiled in table  [ tab : fluc ] .",
    "the mean and standard deviation of each fit for @xmath44 gev are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mean ] .",
    "each dataset was taken over spans of several days to several weeks , all spanning three separate rhic running periods . during these periods ,",
    "changes in the total acceptance and efficiency of the central arm spectrometers cause the fluctuation measurements to vary , thus introducing an additional systematic error to the results .",
    "this systematic error was minimized by requiring that the dataset is stable in quantities that are sensitive to detector variations , including the mean charged particle multiplicity , mean collision vertex position , and mean centrality .",
    "a time - dependent systematic error is applied independently to each point by calculating the standard deviation of the scaled variance calculated from subsets of the entire dataset , with each subset containing about 1 million events .",
    "these systematic errors are applied to all subsequent results .",
    "the tracking efficiency of the phenix central arm spectrometer is dependent on centrality , especially in the most central 200 gev au+au collisions @xcite . with the assumption that tracking inefficiencies randomly effect the multiplicity distribution on an event - by - event basis",
    ", the effect of inefficiencies on the scaled variance can be estimated using equation ( [ eq : acc ] ) where @xmath45 is replaced by the inverse of the tracking efficiency , 1/@xmath46 .",
    "tracking efficiency effects the value of the scaled variance by 1.5% at the most .",
    "the scaled variance has been corrected for tracking inefficiency as a function of centrality for all species .",
    "the uncertainty of the tracking efficiency estimate is typically 2% and has been propagated into the systematic error estimate on a point - by - point basis .    due to the non - zero width of the centrality bin selection from the data , each centrality bin",
    "necessarily selects a range of impact parameters .",
    "this introduces a non - dynamical fluctuation component to the measured multiplicity fluctuations due to the resulting fluctuations in the geometry of the collisions @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to estimate the magnitude of the geometry fluctuation component so that only the interesting dynamical fluctuations remain . the most practical method for estimating",
    "the geometry fluctuation component is with a model of heavy ion collisions .",
    "the urqmd @xcite and hsd @xcite models have previously been applied for this purpose . here , the hijing event generator @xcite is chosen for this estimate because it well reproduces the mean multiplicity in heavy ion collisions @xcite as measured by the phenix detector .",
    "hijing includes multiple minijet production based upon qcd - inspired models , soft excitation , nuclear shadowing of parton distribution functions , and the interaction of jets in dense nuclear matter .",
    "the estimate is performed individually for each centrality bin , collision system , and @xmath43 range using the following procedure .",
    "first , hijing is run with an impact parameter distribution that is sampled from a gaussian distribution with a mean and standard deviation that , for a given centrality bin , reproduces the distributions of the charge deposited in the bbc and the energy deposited in the zdc ( for 200 gev au+au ) .",

    "the characteristics of all of the heavy ion data sets are the same .",
    "the value of @xmath94 varies little within the range 1.0 - 1.1 .",
    "the heavy ion data universally exhibit only weak clustering characteristics as interpreted by the clan model .",
    "there is also no significant variation seen with collision energy .",
    "however , @xmath94 is consistently significantly higher in elementary collisions . in elementary collisions , it is less probable to produce events with a high multiplicity , which can reveal rare sources of clusters such as jet production or multiple parton interactions .",

    "a feature that is especially apparent in the au+au data is the fact that the scaled variance decreases with increasing centrality , with the most central point lying below the participant superposition model expectatation .",
    "the clan model provides one possible explanation for this effect whereby there is a higher probability for contributions from cluster sources such as jet production in the lower multiplicity peripheral events . the cluster sources introduce correlations that can increase the value of @xmath95 and hence the value of the scaled variance of the multiplicity distribution .",
    "another possible explanation for this feature can be addressed with a string percolation model in heavy ion collisions @xcite . in general",
    ", percolation theory considers the formation of clusters within a random spatial distribution of individual objects that are allowed to overlap with each other .",
    "the clusters are formed by the geometrical connection of one or more of the individual objects .",
    "this can be applied to estimate multiplicity fluctuations in heavy ion collisions whereby the objects are the circular cross sections of strings in the transverse plane @xcite and the strings form clusters of overlapping strings that then each emit a number of particles related to the number of strings in each cluster . as the centrality increases , the number of individual clusters decreases along with the variance of the number of strings per cluster , which can result in a decrease in the magnitude of the resulting multiplicity fluctuations .",
    "the prediction of the scaled variance from the string percolation model for 200 gev au+au collisions scaled down to the phenix acceptance in azimuth and pseudorapidity @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : svarhij ] .",
    "although percolation describes the trend observed at the four highest centralities very well , the scaled variance from the model continues to increase well above the data as centrality decreases .",

    "phenix has completed a survey of multiplicity fluctuations of charged hadrons in au+au and cu+cu collisions at three collision energies .",
    "the motivation for the analysis is to search for signs of a phase transition or the presence of the predicted critical point on the qcd phase diagram by looking for increased multiplicity fluctuations as a function of system energy and system volume . after correcting for non - dynamical fluctuations due to fluctuations of the collision geometry within a centrality bin ,",
    "the multiplicity fluctuations in 200 gev and 62.4 gev au+au collisions are consistent with or below the expectation from the superposition model of participant nucleons .",
    "the multiplicity fluctuations decrease as the collision centrality increases , dropping below the participant superposition model expectation for the most central au+au collisions .",
    "fluctuations from cu+cu collisions exhibit a weaker centrality - dependence that also is consistent with or below the expectation from the participant superposition model .",
    "the absence of large dynamical fluctuations in excess of the participant superposition model expectation indicate that there is no evidence of critical behavior related to the compressibility observable in this dataset .",
    "there is also no significant evidence of dynamical fluctuations that are dependent on the transverse momentum or the charge of the particles measured .",
    "as interpreted by the clan model , the observed fluctuations demonstrate only weak clustering characteristics for all of the heavy ion collision systems discussed here .",
    "the decreasing scaled variance with increasing centrality may be explained by percolation phenomena , however this fails to explain the most peripheral au+au data .",
    "although this analysis does not observe evidence of critical behavior , it does not rule out the existence of a qcd critical point .",
