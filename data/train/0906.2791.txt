    "the kondo effect has long served as a paradigm in the field of strongly correlated electron physics .",
    "it is perhaps the simplest example of a system where many - body interactions can give rise to highly non - trivial behavior : its essence involves nothing more than a localized magnetic impurity which is exchange coupled to conduction electrons in a metal .",
    "despite having been studied for over 40 years , interest in kondo physics shows no sign of abating .",
    "a large part of this continued interest has been fueled by recent advances allowing the controllable realization of unusual kondo effects in nanostructures .",
    "these include multi - channel kondo effects @xcite , where there are many conserved flavours of conduction electrons : such systems can give rise to non - fermi liquid physics , and have recently been realized using semiconductor quantum dots @xcite .",
    "another class of exotic kondo effects are so called su(@xmath0 ) kondo effects , where @xmath2 .",
    "such systems involve only a single channel of conduction electrons , but the effective spin of the impurity and conduction electrons is greater than @xmath3 .",
    "while such systems are still described at low - energies by a fermi liquid fixed point , the properties of this fermi liquid are modified in several interesting ways compared to the spin-@xmath3 case @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath1 has received particular attention due to its realizability in double @xcite and triple quantum dots @xcite as well as carbon nanotube quantum dots @xcite",
    ".    research on kondo physics has also been spurred by the possibility of studying experimentally its behaviour when driven out - of - equilibrium , where non - equilibrium is either achieved by the application of a drain - source voltage across a quantum dot @xcite , or by externally radiating a quantum dot @xcite .",
    "the non - equilibrium induced by a voltage has been the subject of a number of recent theoretical works @xcite .    in this paper , we will focus on a topic which combines two of the above avenues of kondo research : we will study non - equilibrium charge transport through a voltage - biased quantum dot exhibiting an su(@xmath0 ) kondo effect , focusing on the low - temperature regime where the physics is described by an effective fermi liquid theory .",
    "we present calculations for both the non - linear conductance as well as for the current noise .",
    "as has been stressed in a number of recent papers @xcite , the fluctuations of current through a kondo quantum dot are extremely sensitive to the two - particle interactions associated with the underlying fermi liquid theory .",
    "this was first discussed in the case of the standard su(@xmath4 ) kondo effect by sela et al .",
    "@xcite , and was even measured for this system in a recent experiment by zarchin et al .  @xcite . as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the situation becomes even more interesting for @xmath2 , as now one must deal with the interplay between coherent partition noise ( due to the zero - energy transmission coefficient through the dot not being one ) and the interaction - induced scattering events . of particular interest is the case @xmath1 , which can be realized in carbon nanotube quantum dots .",
    "very recently , current noise in such a system has been measured experimentally by delattre et al .",
    "@xcite , though not in the low - temperature fermi liquid regime we describe here .    the results presented here both clarify and extend those presented in refs .",
    "@xcite , as well as provide details underlying the calculational approach .",
    "particular attention is given to the role of higher - order fermi liquid corrections , something that was not correctly treated in previous works ( see erratum , ref .",
    "we show clearly how in the @xmath1 case , such corrections lead to an effective shift of the kondo resonance with applied bias voltage . as a result ,",
    "the non - linear conductance does not increase with voltage , as would be expected from a simple picture of the kondo resonance as a resonant level sitting above the fermi energy .",
    "these fermi - liquid energy shifts are absent in the usual @xmath5 kondo effect .",
    "we also describe the experimentally - relevant case where there is an asymmetry in the coupling between the quantum dot and the source and drain electrodes .",
    "such an asymmetry has not been investigated thoroughly in previous works .",
    "the remainder of this paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - model ] , we outline the basic description of our model and the fermi liquid approach .",

    "[ results ] , we summarize our main results for the conductance and shot noise of a su(n ) kondo quantum dot , and conclude .",

    "the rotation in the basis of leads electrons @xmath20 decouples the @xmath21 operators from the dot variables .",
    "the kondo screening then involves only the @xmath22 variables . in the symmetric case , @xmath19 , @xmath22 and @xmath21 represent respectively even and odd wavefunctions with the dot placed at @xmath23 .",
    "we consider in this work the kondo limit where the charging energy @xmath13 is by far the largest energy scale .",
    "below this energy , the charge degree of freedom on the dot is quenched to an integer value and does not fluctuate . for @xmath24 ,",
    "the number of electrons is @xmath25 .",
    "the virtual occupation of other charge states by exchange tunneling with the leads is accounted for by the standard schrieffer - wolff transformation  @xcite ( or second order perturbation theory ) .",
    "it transforms eq .   to the kondo hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28",
    "this hamiltonian acts in the subspace constrained by @xmath29 . in this paper , we concentrate on the choice @xmath24 for which potential scattering terms vanish after the schrieffer - wolff transformation .",
    "including potential scattering in the formalism is possible , for example along the line of ref .  @xcite .",
    "it however remains outside the scope of this work where we focus on the asymmetric dot - lead couplings .",
    "the lead electrons transform under the fundamental representation of su(n ) . with exactly @xmath30 electrons ,",
    "the localized spin on the dot transforms as a representation of su(n ) corresponding to a single column young tableau of @xmath30 boxes . a basis of generators for this su(n ) representation is formed by the @xmath31 traceless components @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "this basis can be used  @xcite to rewrite eq .   as an antiferromagnetic coupling @xmath34 between the impurity ( dot ) spin @xmath35 and the spin operator of the lead electrons taken at @xmath23 , @xmath36 .",

    "affleck  @xcite has shown by completing the square that the impurity spin can be absorbed by lead electrons .",
    "the resulting ( conformal field ) theory is that of free fermions and it is believed to describe the strong coupling fixed point .",
    "it shows a simple translation of energies in the spectrum corresponding to an electron phase shift imposed by the friedel sum rule @xmath42 the identification of the leading irrelevant operator at this fixed point yields fermi liquid behavior  @xcite . alternatively and following ref .",
    "@xcite the ground state of eq .   has been shown  @xcite to be a singlet state . turning the coupling to the leads",

    "finally , numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) calculations have confirmed this picture for su(2 )  @xcite and su(4 )  @xcite .",
    "we now discuss in detail the fermi liquid theory for the kondo effect , first introduced by nozires  @xcite .",
    "it describes the low energy regime - the vicinity of the strong coupling fixed point - and allows one to make quantitative predictions even in an out - of - equilibrium situation . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the fermi liquid theory of nozires has been extended with the introduction of the next - to - leading order corrections to the strong coupling fixed point .",
    "these corrections are necessary in the su(n ) case for observables like the current and the noise since their energy ( @xmath43 , @xmath44 or @xmath45 ) dependence is mostly quadratic .",
    "the kondo many - body singlet ( also called the ` kondo cloud ' ) having been formed , we wish to describe how lead electrons scatter off it . at low energies , two channels open : an elastic and an inelastic one .",
    "both take place at the dot position @xmath23 .",
    "elastic scattering is described by an energy - dependent phase shift . at the fermi level @xmath10 ,",
    "it is equal to @xmath46 , see eq .  .",
    "we expand the phase shift around the fermi energy , @xmath47 where the energy @xmath48 is measured from @xmath10 . @xmath49 and @xmath50 are dimensionless coefficients of order one .",
    "it is instructive to think of the _ elastic _ scattering off the kondo singlet in terms of an effective non - interacting resonant level model ( rlm ) , where this effective resonance represents the many - body kondo resonance .",
    "this is the picture of the kondo effect provided by slave - boson mean - field theory  @xcite , and is an exact description of the su(@xmath0 ) kondo effect in the large @xmath0 limit @xcite .",

    "the fact that the kondo resonance sits above the fermi energy is indeed seen in exact nrg calculations of the impurity spectral density @xcite .",
    "the low energy expansion of the rlm phase shift @xmath56 also gives the form eq .   with @xmath57 .",
    "note that there is no apriori reason that this relation must hold for the expansion of the true phase shift , as the correspondence to a non - interacting resonant level is not exact . despite this caveat",
    ", one finds that the prediction from the rlm picture is quite good even at a quantitative level .",
    "the exact relation between @xmath49 and @xmath50 is extracted  @xcite from the bethe ansatz solution  @xcite and reads @xmath58 where @xmath46 is given eq .  .",
    "in the su(2 ) case , or more generally for a half - filled dot with @xmath59 , @xmath60 , corresponding to a kondo resonance centered at the fermi level .",

    "in fact , eqs .   and   correspond to a systematic expansion of the energy  @xcite , compatible with the su(n ) symmetry and the pauli principle .",
    "it includes all first and second order terms in the low energy coupling strength @xmath70 .",
    "the great advantage of the fermi liquid approach is that it can also be applied to non - equilibrium situations .",
    "note that the fermi level @xmath10 appears twice in the above equations : it defines the reference for energies in the elastic phase shift   and also for the normal ordering in eq .  .",
    "when the system is put out - of - equilibrium , for instance when each lead has its own fermi level , @xmath10 loses its meaning as a fermi level and becomes merely an _",

    "perturbatively . among the various diagrams built from eq .  , it is convenient to separate the trivial hartree contributions to the electron self - energy from the more complicated diagrams .",
    "the former are obtained by keeping an incoming and an outgoing line and by closing all other external lines to form loops as shown fig .",

    "@xmath79 is the actual quasiparticle distribution ( @xmath80 ) relative to the ground state with fermi energy @xmath10 .",
    "we see again that @xmath10 sets the reference in eq .   for both @xmath48 and @xmath81 .",
    "including hartree diagrams is essentially tantamount to a mean - field treatment of the interaction term eq .  .",
    "on a physical level , these hartree terms can be interpreted as a mean - field energy shift of the kondo resonance arising from a finite quasiparticle population and their interactions .",
    "we shall see that in the case of an su(@xmath53 ) kondo quantum dot , these hartree terms play a significant role in determining the non - linear conductance ; this is not the case in the more conventional su(@xmath4 ) kondo effect .    while the idea of perturbatively treating @xmath72 is straightforward enough , a possible weakness of the fermi liquid approach is the number of seemingly undetermined parameters in eqs .   and  .",
    "the standard fermi liquid treatment of the kondo effect allows one to relate the coefficients @xmath49 and @xmath82 via the so - called ` floating ' of the kondo resonance ( to be discussed below ) ; these coefficients correspond to leading - order fermi liquid corrections .",
    "however , for transport quantities in the general su(@xmath0 ) kondo case , we will see that the remaining coefficients , corresponding to higher - order corrections , are also important .",
    "luckily , these too can be related to one another using a novel and powerful extension of the kondo _ floating _ recently proposed in ref .",
    "it allows to relate the different phenomenological coefficients of eqs .   and  ; we describe the basic reasoning involved in what follows .",
    "the kondo resonance is a many - body phenomenon that results from the sharpness of the fermi sea boundary  @xcite .",
    "physically , conduction electrons build their own resonance . the structure of this resonance is therefore changing with the conduction electron occupation numbers , as eq",
    ".   shows explicitly .",
    "however it can not depend on @xmath10 , which is a _",
    "fixed _ energy reference .",
    "this idea is implemented by shifting the fermi level @xmath10 by @xmath83 while keeping the _ absolute _ energy @xmath84 and the _ absolute _ occupation numbers @xmath85 fixed in eq .  .",
    "as a result @xmath86 and @xmath87 . imposing invariance of the phase shift leads to the following fermi liquid identities    [ fls ] @xmath88\\label{fls2 } \\alpha_2 = \\frac{n-1}{4 } \\ , \\phi_2 , & \\qquad \\phi_2 = ( n-2 ) \\ , \\chi_2,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the first relation   was initially derived for the general su(@xmath0 ) case by nozires and blandin  @xcite .",
    "note that an alternative way to derive eqs .",
    "is to insist that the _ entire structure _ of the kondo resonance simply translates in energy when we dope the system with quasiparticles in a way that corresponds to a simple increase of the fermi energy  @xcite .",
    "nozires original derivation of eq . in the su(@xmath4 ) case @xcite also used this idea , but restricted attention to an initial state with no quasiparticles .",
    "follow when we apply the same reasoning to an initial state having some finite number of quasiparticles .",
    "note that for su(2 ) , or a half - filled dot ( @xmath59 ) , @xmath89 from eq .",
    "so that @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the next - to - leading order corrections all vanish in agreement with previous works on the ordinary su(2 ) case  @xcite .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the second generation of fermi liquid terms @xmath92 can also be derived in the framework of conformal field theory . in ref .",
    "@xcite , a single cubic casimir operator is given , which reproduces the three terms corresponding to the coefficients @xmath93 , and @xmath94 .",
    "the identities   are then automatically satisfied .",
    "the _ floating _ of the kondo resonance ( and resulting conditions ) also has an important consequence for calculations of observables in the presence of a voltage : the results will not depend on where one decided to place the dot fermi energy @xmath10 within the energy window defined by the chemical potentials of the leads . on a technical level , this is because , by virtue of eqs .",
    ", any shift @xmath83 of the dot fermi energy will be completely compensated by a corresponding shift in the hartree contributions arising from the quasiparticle interactions .",
    "this invariance is explained in detail in fig .",
    "[ gauge ] .",
    "note also that this invariance has physical consequences as well : it implies , for example , that the current is not affected by the capacitive coupling to the leads ( in the kondo limit ) .     diagrammatic construction for the independence of observables in @xmath10 .",
    "crosses correspond to elastic scattering .",
    "two- and three - particle interactions are represented by , respectively , black and grey full circles .",
    "many diagrams in the perturbative expansion in @xmath72   exhibit a dependence in @xmath10 .",

    "apart from ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) , all other diagrammatic parts involve energy differences in which the reference @xmath10 naturally disappears .",
    "the combinations ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) can be understood as emerging from ward identities related to the u(1 ) gauge symmetry . for example , eq .   has been shown  @xcite to derive from a ward identity with a vanishing charge susceptibility.,width=283 ]    given the above invariance , it is convenient for calculations to choose the fermi level such that @xmath95 so that any closed fermionic loop built from an energy - independent vertex vanishes . for this choice of position",
    ", @xmath96 vanishes which greatly simplifies the phase shift expression  .",
    "moreover , the @xmath94 vertex in eq .   does not contribute to the current and the noise when the perturbative calculation is stopped at second order .",
    "the reason for that is that the @xmath94 vertex is already second order and can only appear once .",
    "its six legs are connected to at most two current vertices so that at least two of these legs must connect to form a closed loop implying a vanishing contribution .",
    "in contrast to these simplifications , @xmath97 in eq .   remains generally different from zero due to the energy dependence of the @xmath98 vertex in eq .  .",
    "on may wonder whether the physical argument of the _ floating _ of the kondo resonance , as presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and repeated in this paper , is sufficient to extend the results of this paper to higher orders fermi liquid corrections . applying the _ floating _ argument to the next ( third ) order , one obtains an incomplete set of relations between the coefficients such that some of them remain undetermined . in the language of conformal field theory , it means that more than one operator is involved at each ( higher ) order .",
    "how to relate the coefficients of those operators is a rather difficult problem . in the su(2 )",
    "case , a solution was given by lesage and saleur  @xcite .",
    "we finally turn to the discussion of the fermi liquid model renormalization .",
    "treated naively , the model leads to divergences in physical quantities .",
    "it is regularized  @xcite by introducing an energy cutoff @xmath99 ( different from the original band width of the model ) larger than typical energies of the problem but smaller than @xmath100 .",
    "energies in eq .",
    "are therefore restricted to the window @xmath101 $ ] .",
    "the dependence of observables in @xmath99 is then removed by adding counterterms in the hamiltonian .",
    "it is strictly equivalent to the introduction of cutoff @xmath99 dependence in the coupling constants  @xcite ( @xmath102 , @xmath103 , etc ) .",
    "the corresponding counterterms are discussed in appendix  [ counterterms ] .",
    "we now outline the calculation of the current using the fermi liquid theory described in previous sections .",
    "again , the complete hamiltonian is @xmath104 ( c.f .",

    "contributions to the current which only involve @xmath105 ( thus defined ) will be referred to as the ` elastic current ' .",
    "@xmath72 is then added perturbatively , without hartree diagrams , in order to compute the corrections due to inelastic scattering .      the current operator at @xmath106 is generally given by @xmath107 where @xmath30 is the electron mass .",
    "various expressions can be obtained for the current depending on which basis it is expanded .",
    "it is convenient  @xcite in our case to choose the basis of scattering states that includes completely elastic ( and hartree terms ) scattering , _",

    "one important characteristics of the emergent su(@xmath53 ) symmetry is the sign change of the leading current corrections ( _ i.e. _ linear in @xmath148 ) as a function of the bias voltage when progressively tuning the asymmetry between the dot - lead couplings .",
    "more precisely , for a strong asymmetry , we have recovered a positive linear correction which traduces the fact that the kondo resonance is peaked away from the fermi level ; in this case , the conductance measures the density of states of the kondo resonance at @xmath221 where the sign changes with the weakly coupled lead . for symmetric couplings ,",
    "we have demonstrated that the linear correction now becomes exactly zero and that the current becomes maximum at @xmath224 due to interactions via the hartree contributions .",
