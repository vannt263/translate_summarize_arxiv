    ", water may exist in more than one amorphous solid state .",
    "preparations and transitions between these amorphous states are irreversible and therefore beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "our approach for analyzing remnants of first - order phase transitions in bounded systems begins by choosing a general phenomenological hamiltonian for an order - parameter field parameterized with experimental data .",
    "we then perform statistical mechanical calculations for the bounded systems based upon that hamiltonian , and we test assumptions in our analysis with atomistic simulations . our strategy for examining the possibility of out - of - equilibrium transitions to glassy sates is to use scaling principles @xcite to bootstrap to the glass transition from knowledge of structural relaxation times at moderately supercooled conditions , and to use molecular simulation to test assumptions underlying that approach .",

    "this particular order parameter is large in proportion to the concentration of water molecules with neighbors having the same orientations of neighboring bonds as does the molecule itself .",
    "the quantity @xmath69 is its non - zero value for the bulk liquid .",
    "past experience has shown that using the @xmath70 spherical harmonics with 4 nearest neighbors is particularly useful for detailing local structure in water.@xcite    with this or some similar order - parameter field , we choose the energy to have the following form @xmath71 = k_\\mathrm{b } t \\int_v \\ , \\mathrm{d } \\mathbf{r } \\ ,   \\left [ f ( q(\\mathbf{r } ) ) + \\frac{m}{2 } | \\nabla q(\\mathbf{r } ) |^2 \\right]\\,,\\ ] ] @xmath72 where @xmath73 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath74 is the deviation of the order parameter field from its uniform value for bulk liquid water , and @xmath75 , with @xmath27 being the temperature below which the bulk liquid is unstable .",

    "the zero of energy is that of the disordered amorphous material .",
    "the most significant feature of this phenomenological energy functional is the presence of only one field , specifically one that refers to local order , and that local molecular density is explicitly absent .",
    "we adopt this feature for two reasons .",
    "first , our prior simulation work indicates that the reversible free energy function for condensed water has no more than one amorphous - state basin and no more than one crystal - state basin at the conditions we consider.@xcite second , we show below that we do not need to invoke the possibility of two liquid states to explain the experimental data we set out to interpret . in our picture , therefore , molecular density introduces no additional phase - transition - like behavior . to the extent",
    "our picture is accurate , integrating out density therefore affects only the values of the parameters already included .",
    "two other significant features of the energy functional is the truncation at fourth order in the order parameter and the neglect of inhomogeneity beyond the square gradient term .",
    "the first feature limits our treatment to no more than two distinct reversible phases .",
    "as noted above , we believe this limitation is acceptable for the conditions we consider .",
    "the second feature limits our treatment to a long wavelength description of interfaces .",

    "nevertheless , the rise in the mean order parameter from its disordered value at the wall to its crystal - like value in the center of the pore is consistent with those of the simulation when coarse grained over a particle diameter .",
    "the general agreement of the profiles calculated with our molecular dynamics simulations with those calculated neglecting curvature corrections indicates those corrections are small .",
    "the amplitude of the oscillations in the mean order parameter obtained from the simulation results are relatively small , typically 10% of the mean , except at the very center of the pore where statistics is unreliable .",
    "away from the center , the oscillations are especially small in comparison to those that would be found in an ordered crystal .",
    "the amplitudes are diminished from those of a crystal due to the average over disorder along the length of the tube .",
    "the width of the interface exhibits a slight temperature dependence . for larger pores ,",
    "however , the situation changes .",
    "as the radius grows beyond the conditions treated here , the coexistence temperatures will tend towards the bulk melting temperature .",

    "it is is a general behavior accompanying any first - order transition with appropriate boundary conditions.@xcite    the theory we have employed to describe pre - melting in a finite system would not only seem easily generalizable to treating pre - melting profiles of bulk ice in contact with its vapor or liquid,@xcite it would also seem applicable to stability and thermodynamics of nano - clusters of ice,@xcite and to nucleation of ice on atmospheric aerosols.@xcite it might also be generalizable to describe ordering of water in cold micro emulsions like those recently considered by tanaka and co - workers.@xcite indications of order - disorder phenomena occurring in the finite water - rich domains of those systems have been interpreted in terms of a doubtful liquid - liquid transition in supercooled water . based upon what we have derived in this paper , we believe a more natural explanation of tanaka s observations will be found in terms ice - water equilibrium and the effects of confinement on that phase equilibrium      to test the applicability of turnbull s @xmath193 , we have calculated the surface tension and enthalpy of fusion as functions of temperature.@xcite see fig .",

    "to make that figure , we have determined the enthalpy of fusion by calculating the average enthalpy density differences at coexistence , @xmath196 .",
    "similarly , we have determined the surface tension by calculating the free energy as a function of @xmath57 , using the umbrella sampling procedure described in ref .   for @xmath197 particles at a constant pressure , @xmath198 atm .",

    "the surface tension is then obtained by taking the difference between the free energy at the top of the barrier and at its stable coexisting basins .",
    "specifically , @xmath199 where @xmath200 is the interfacial free energy calculated by first preforming a maxwell construction to place the system at coexistence at the different temperatures , and @xmath201.@xcite this procedure is exact in the limit of @xmath202 .",
    "we have checked that we closely approach the limiting value by studying several system sizes up to @xmath203 particles .",
    "this surface tension is an effective surface tension obtained by integrating over all distinct crystallographic faces and agrees well with that obtained from a recent nucleation study.@xcite      for our calculations here we assume that the bulk melting line can be accuratly approximated by @xmath204 $ ] .",
    "the coefficient @xmath205 is related to heat of fusion and the change in volume between water and ice determined at ambient pressure , as derived through the clapeyron equation . for water @xmath206 ( ref . ) and for the mw model @xmath207.@xcite this difference in slope between the mw model and real water is due to the mw model over estimating the density of ice ih.@xcite however , by defining a pressure scale in units of @xmath205 , the equation of state of water and the mw model can be related .    the mw model we calculate @xmath20 and @xmath38 to be 2.40  and 8.16  respectively .",
    "these are slightly different than what we find for real water , and the differences account for the differences between our predicted melting line for real water and the calculated melting temperature of the mw model for @xmath208 .",

    "relaxation times for the molecular dynamics simulations were determined by calculating the mean time for a particle to displace one diameter ,      while nominal nanopore radii are routinely reported in the literature , it is difficult to obtain a reliable estimate of @xmath133 for @xmath212 1 nm .",
    "different techniques yield a range of different sizes.@xcite most commonly , pore sizes are inferred from a barrett - joyner - halenda ( bjh ) analysis.@xcite this method amounts to measuring a nitrogen absorption isotherm , and is thus an indirect measure of size .",

    "the pore sizes inferred from this collapse indicates that the bjh method systematically underestimates pore sizes.@xcite previous studies claiming to study the same pore sizes have observed widely different behavior . for instance , ref .",
