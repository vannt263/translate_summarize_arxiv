    "the mass distribution of dark matter haloes provides a direct probe of the nature of the dark matter particle , as the inner structure of dark matter haloes is particularly sensitive to the dark matter properties .",
    "for example , warm dark matter should produce lower density halo cores than cold dark matter ( cdm ) because of the phase density ceiling introduced by the non - zero thermal velocity of warm particles ( e.g.  tremaine & gunn 1979 ) .",
    "the variation of peak halo phase density with halo mass is also dependent on the `` coldness '' of the dark matter particle ( e.g.  lake 1989 and references therein ) .",
    "spectroscopic observations of stellar motions in galaxies , lensing properties and x - ray temperature maps of cluster cores each can provide a measurement of the central dark matter distribution in haloes , albeit with some uncertainty inherent in inferring the dark matter distribution from properties of baryons or baryon dominated regions .",

    "2003 ) , or may perhaps reflect some systematic bias common to all high resolution n - body simulations . alternatively , the disagreement may be due to a problem with common assumptions made when reconstructing mass profiles from circular velocity data ( hayashi et al .",
    "strong gravitational lensing in clusters can potentially provide a direct measurement of the halo mass profile , and indeed central mass profiles for several lensing clusters have been calculated ( tyson , kochanski , & dellantonio 1998 ; shapiro & iliev 2000 ; sand , treu , & ellis 2002 ; gavazzi et al .  2003 ; sand et al .",

    "the central cusp is especially sensitive to flattening caused by poor resolution or other numerical effects ( e.g.  moore et al .  1998 ) , so slightly different numerical techniques might produce significantly different density profiles , making it sometimes difficult to compare results of different authors",

    ", the slope slowly steepens with time at @xmath482 , but in our other less massive haloes , the inner density profile slope shows no significant change .",
    "the large fluctuation in the profile slope at @xmath49 for the galaxy halo and at @xmath50 for the dwarf halo are most likely due to the presence of subhaloes that are disrupted earlier .",
    "whatever physical mechanism is responsible for setting the density profile , it must have largely occurred at very high redshift .",
    "the lack of evolution in the physical densities means that the profile of an individual halo is substantially shallower at high redshift in terms of @xmath51 .",
    "such apparent steepening of the slope with time is merely a scaling issue due to the growth of the virial radius as mass is added to the outer regions of the halo .",
    "here we note that the profile slope is almost never shallower than the nfw asymptotic value of @xmath17 . only in the very inner region of our largest cluster cl1 at @xmath49 , where the slope trends toward @xmath52 at the innermost resolved radius ( not plotted ) ,",
    "is there a slight hint that nfw slope may be too steep at high redshifts , but this could be simply a result of a subhalo just beyond that radius creating a local density minima , or it could be due to artificial numerical resolution effects at high redshift where the halo resolution is lower .",

    "if not simply a coincidence , then this implies that the central cusp material is assembled earlier in haloes with steeper central slope parameters .",
    "we then consider the effects of the mass accretion history of the cluster on the final density profile , and find that accretion history correlates with halo concentration , not with cusp slope .",
    "[ cubefofcen ] shows that the three haloes with the highest concentration undergo a phase of rapid growth at @xmath68 , making their normalised mass temporarily @xmath69 times larger than the other seven clusters , which experience nearly uniform accretion rates .",

    "previous high resolution simulations discussed earlier have mostly modelled haloes with masses of @xmath85 or higher , leaving the possibility that a mass dependence on the density profile might be able to solve the cusp problem . however , our results show that the observed conflict with @xmath0cdm density profiles gets worse when considering simulated dwarfs .",
    "the enclosed mass at a given radius near the halo core is higher for simulated haloes of lower mass , since the concentration radius is smaller and the measured slope is steeper .",

    "we confirm that the physical slope of haloes remains stable over time .",
    "the inner regions of haloes appear to be composed of mass assembled at very high redshift , implying that present - epoch density - profiles are determined by the high redshift merger history .",
    "we do see some apparent evolution in the physical slope at very high redshifts for our highest resolution cluster and group .",
    "this suggests that for group and clusters - size haloes , events occurring at @xmath86 are partially responsible for determining the final shape of the density profile , while galaxies and smaller mass haloes have their inner density profile shape almost entirely determined at higher redshifts .",
    "the progenitor region of the host halo , because of its large scale density enhancement , is the likely site of early - forming small haloes , many of which will merge to form the cusp .",
    "after the universe has expanded by a few factors since the cusp material is assembled , the characteristic densities of haloes merging into the main halo should be lower than typical densities within the main cusp , because of their generally later assembly epoch .",
    "consequently , merging subhaloes will likely be disrupted before dynamical friction can bring them near the centre of the main halo , where they can affect the central density profile . in this scenario",
    ", halo density profiles could converge to roughly flat profiles ( in terms of @xmath51 ) at extremely high redshifts .",

    "\\(3 ) _ lessons from the power law cosmologies . _",
    "the dependence of the concentration parameter on @xmath15 is most likely the result of a mechanism analogous to what sets the dependence of concentration on the spectral slope in our power law cosmologies . in the power law cosmologies ,",
    "the ratio of local small - scale to large - scale power depends primarily on the spectral index . when there is lots of small scale power , the central density profile is generally steeper at any specific radius than when there is little small scale power . in the case of a shallow spectral index ,",
    "subhaloes form early , which implies that they have small characteristic radii and thus large characteristic densities , whereas steep spectral indices have late - forming subhaloes .",
    "similar formation epoch arguments can also explain the steeper profiles of small @xmath15 haloes . for smaller @xmath15 haloes , many subhaloes should form earlier relative to their hosts , since the subhaloes lie at lower @xmath87 fluctuations in the density field relative to the local fluctuation on the scale of the host halo . alternatively ,",
    "smaller @xmath15 haloes , which generally form earlier , and hence when the mean density of the universe is evolving more rapidly , will have subhaloes and cusp material assembled over a wider range of densities than for large @xmath15 haloes .",
    "haloes with small @xmath15 are thus similar to haloes with a shallow spectral index , because they have subhaloes that form earlier at higher densities relative to the host halo . in models where the inner slope is formed from disrupted subhaloes infalling via dynamical friction , lots of small - scale power should give the main halo a larger concentration parameter .",
    "in fact , when there are lots of dense subhaloes more of them will be able to reach closer to the core , steepening the halo nearer to the centre .",
    "\\(4 ) _ is there an asymptotic cusp ? _",
    "a strength of the nfw profile , is that varying just the concentration radius can yield reasonable fits to haloes with very different inner slopes at scales currently resolved by simulations .",
    "however , there are no compelling theoretical arguments that the halo profile converges to a slope of @xmath17 at smaller radii .",
    "the analytical models mentioned in the introduction imply that the core slope should be a function of @xmath15 or power spectral slope .",

    "simulations of haloes with very high @xmath15 , very steep power spectral indices , or orders of magnitude more particles able to probe much farther inward , should be able to test whether or not the r@xmath88 nfw central slope corresponds to a minimum possible slope set by the physical processes of cdm halo formation .",

    "future simulations will likely need to probe below @xmath230.001 r@xmath89 in order to determine whether dark haloes have an asymptotic central cusp .",

    "our evidence in the cubehi clusters for a likely correlation between the cusp material assembly epoch and cusp slope , and between halo accretion history and concentration radius , suggests that the density profiles might be at least partly determined from the evolutionary history of the progenitor haloes and substructures clumps .",
