    "conducting polymers are an important class of organic materials with a wide range of potential applications from nanoelectronics @xcite to medicine @xcite . many of these polymer chains contain five - membered rings @xcite .",
    "in particular polythiophene @xcite was analyzed in the search for plastic ferromagnets and for ferromagnetism in systems made entirely from nonmagnetic elements .",
    "the theoretical investigation of ferromagnetism in pentagon chains was started @xcite with a focus on flat - band ferromagnetism @xcite .",
    "suwa et al .",
    "@xcite proposed that the ferromagnetism in pentagon chains is related to the hybridization of @xmath2 and @xmath3 bands and hence described these systems by a periodic anderson model ( pam ) relying on the previously established ferromagnetism in the pam in various conditions @xcite . in the pam used in ref.11 the electronic interaction acts site selective within the unit cell .",
    "the model of suwa et al .",
    "@xcite was therefore an attempt to account for the different atoms in the unit cell of the pentagon chains .",
    "we will also account for this fact by allowing for different on - site coulomb repulsion values on different type of sites inside the unit cell .",
    "furthermore , since the pentagon chain polymers always have external side groups , the pentagon chains we choose to describe also contain such external links . for illustration , a schematic view of the pentagon chain polyaminotriazole",
    "is presented in fig . 1 .    in the early stage of the theoretical work on conducting polymers , especially on properties related to polyacetylene",
    ", the electronic correlations were not considered important @xcite . in recent years",
    "it become however clear that e.g. in pentagon or hexagon repeat units in conducting organic materials , the coulomb interaction between the carriers is important ; the on - site coulomb repulsion value may even be as large as @xmath4 @xcite . for n - acenes and n - thiophenes type of chain structures , brocks et al . emphasized strong correlation effects in acenes and thiophenes and even conjectured that in the high - density region the coulomb interaction should be able to stabilize magnetic order @xcite .",
    "to account accurately for correlation effects , we will here use exact methods .",
    "details of the technique are presented below .",
    "the spectrum of an arbitrary hamiltonian @xmath5 describing a real physical system is bounded below by the ground state energy @xmath6 .",
    "hence , @xmath7 @xmath8 is a positive semidefinite operator with only non - negative eigenvalues @xmath9 , @xmath10 .",
    "hence , based on ( [ i1o ] ) , and without any prior knowledge about @xmath6 , our technique starts by an exact rewriting of the starting hamiltonian in the form @xmath11 where the c - number @xmath12 is a function of the hamiltonian parameters , and @xmath13 are positive semidefinite operators .",
    "the sum @xmath14 is therfore also a positive semidefinite operator . in the present case we will use block operators for @xmath13 which are composed of linear combinations of operators acting on the sites of a finite block , but also apply operators which require at least one electron on each site of the lattice .",
    "since ( [ i1o ] ) always holds , the rewriting ( [ i1 ] ) is in principle always possible , hence the method used here is independent on the spatial dimensions and does not require the integrability of the model hamiltonian .",
    "the reason why ( [ i1 ] ) merits special attention is that the deduction of the ground state @xmath15 can be performed by constructing the most general wave vector which satisfies the equation @xmath16 for solving ( [ i1oo ] ) several techniques have been worked out @xcite , which open a route for deducing exact results for non - integrable systems .",
    "usually the rewriting of the hamiltonian in positive semidefinite form ( [ i1 ] ) can be achieved in several different ways depending on the type and the structure of the @xmath13 operators .",
    "each choice provides matching equations , which ensure the validity of ( [ i1 ] ) , and make explicit how the parameters of @xmath5 transform into the parameters of the positive semidefinite operators and @xmath12 .",
    "the solutions of the matching equations place each transformation in different domains @xmath17 of the parameter space , where also the expression for @xmath12 follows and where the obtained ground state solution @xmath15 with the ground state energy @xmath18 is valid .    in the process of deducing @xmath15 ,",
    "the total number of particles @xmath19 is kept fixed . if the ground state @xmath20 and its energy @xmath21 are obtained in a particle number dependent fashion , it is also possible to obtain information about the low lying excitation spectrum , for example via @xmath22-[e_g(n)-e_g(n-1)]$ ] , where @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) signals the presence ( absence ) of a charge gap .",
    "the construction of the most general ground state means in fact to deduce the unique ground state .",
    "at this point the degeneracy and the uniqueness are different notions .",
    "for example , the set @xmath25 of linearly independent wave functions , where @xmath26 is a possible degeneracy index , represents the unique ground state , if the linear combination @xmath27 , with arbitrary coefficients @xmath28 spans the kernel @xmath29 , where @xmath30 .",
    "the kernel @xmath31 of an operator @xmath32 , is the hilbert subspace containing all wave vectors @xmath33 with the property @xmath34 .",
    "the set @xmath25 spans the kernel of @xmath35 , if two conditions are satisfied , namely : i ) @xmath36 for all @xmath26 , and ii ) all possible wave functions @xmath37 from @xmath29 can be expressed in terms of @xmath25 , i.e. @xmath38 .",
    "the proof of the uniqueness therfore requires to verify points i ) and ii ) .",
    "the exact ground states @xmath39 are deduced for a fixed hamiltonian , hence the used technique is applied to a selected system without the need for prior information about @xmath15 and its physical properties . in these conditions , after obtaining @xmath15 its physical properties must be separately determined .",
    "this is done in a final step by calculating different expectation values with the obtained ground state .    summarizing the procedure presented above",
    ", the applied method divides in five consecutive steps : 1 ) the transformation of the hamiltonian in a positive semidefinite form , 2 ) the solution of the matching equations , 3 ) the construction of the ground states , 4 ) the proof of the uniqueness , and 5 ) the deduction of physical properties .",
    "although similar methods were applied even earlier @xcite , the deduction of exact ground states of non - integrable systems using positive semidefinite operators really started after the paper of brandt and giesekus was published in 1992 @xcite .",
    "but the procedure at that time was different : for a decorated lattice described by a hubbard or a periodic anderson type of model with a @xmath40 on - site interaction , the transformation of the hamiltonian in positive semidefinite form allowed to deduce an exact lower bound @xmath41 for the ground state energy @xmath6 .",
    "based on the variational principle applied to a properly chosen trial wave function @xmath42 , an exact upper bound @xmath43 was obtained in a second step .",
    "pushing these two bonds to the same value ( i.e. @xmath44 ) in a restricted domain @xmath17 of the parameter space led the authors to the ground state energy , while the uniqueness of the ground state was not proven explicitly @xcite .",
    "in the same manner the method was applied by tasaki @xcite to deduce a resonating valence bond type of ground state at @xmath45 in a hubbard model on a decorated lattice , and by strack @xcite to construct ground states for the periodic anderson and the extended emery models in @xmath46 and @xmath47 dimensions on a non - decorated lattice .",
    "the uniqueness of some of these ground states was analyzed by tasaki @xcite , too .",
    "other situations with an infinitely large on - site interaction were also studied for the pam @xcite , the falicov - kimball model @xcite , and extended hubbard models on decorated lattices @xcite .    starting in 1993 also results at finite @xmath48 were obtained for extended hubbard models with a paramagnetic insulating phase , charge density wave @xcite , or ferromagnetic ground states @xcite , and also resonating valence bond type of ground states on decorated lattices ; for the latter case also the uniqueness was proven @xcite . for the pam , the first finite @xmath48 results were published in 2001 for dimensions @xmath46 @xcite and @xmath49 @xcite , and later also for @xmath50 @xcite , in the latter case also with a uniqueness proof .",
    "furthermore , studies of the extended pam @xcite , superconducting states in various circumstances @xcite , and spin systems @xcite were performed , and technical advances accomplished @xcite .    until say 2000 knowledge was accumulated how to transcribe a given operator in positive semidefinite form . despite some exceptions @xcite , the method concentrated on known and fixed wave functions @xmath15 of superconducting or ferromagnetic ground states .",
    "this strategy enlarged considerably the knowledge of phase diagram regions where these phenomena appear ( e.g. for ferromagnetism see ref.35 ) , but in this framework it was difficult to analyze an a priori unknown ground state of a fixed hamiltonian .",
    "this led to a misconception about the essence of the procedure which followed the sequence of steps @xcite : start with a known ground state @xmath51 of a hamiltonian @xmath52 , add operators @xmath53 such that @xmath54 , and identify @xmath55 which also has @xmath51 as its ground state .",
    "this procedure should be compared with the technical steps presented in sect .",
    "i. b.1 , which starts with the choice of the model hamiltonian .",
    "indeed , these developments allow the applicability of the technique to a broad spectrum of topics covering thermodynamic properties @xcite , topological characteristics @xcite , or selected hamiltonians which describe for example conducting polymers @xcite .",
    "the broad possibilities of the method allow also fixed system hamiltonian studies without prior knowledge of the ground state , even in disordered case or presence of textures @xcite .",
    "we use here the technique of positive semidefinite operators for a fixed model hamiltonian , performing the characteristic steps as described in subsection i.b.1 . along this line",
    "the method has been successfully applied previously to describe the 3d pam @xcite and hubbard chains with different geometrical structures @xcite .",
    "the main challenge of this situation is to avoid arbitrary supplementary contributions in @xmath5 in order to obtain positive semidefinite expressions in the hamiltonian ; rather the transformation step is done starting from a fixed hamiltonian @xmath5 .    on the technical level",
    "the advantage of a positive semidefinite hamiltonian is utilized in other methods as well @xcite .",
    "for example the optimal ground state method was first introduced for spin models @xcite , subsequently used for itinerant systems as well @xcite , and applied also in various other circumstances @xcite . in this procedure the hamiltonian @xmath5",
    "is written as a sum over minimal cluster contributions taken in the majority of cases over a bond @xmath56 , where @xmath57 are nearest - neighbor lattice sites .",
    "the operator @xmath58 is diagonalized exactly in the hilbert space of the two - site cluster . by adding a constant to the hamiltonian",
    ", it is achieved that the lowest eigenvalue @xmath59 of @xmath58 becomes zero ( @xmath60 ) , hence @xmath58 is a positive semidefinite operator , with the ground state @xmath61 satisfying @xmath62 for all bonds .",
    "if the global ground state @xmath63 can be constructed from the local ground states @xmath61 ( for example as a product state ) , one finds the optimal ground state .",
    "the method is usually applied with some _ a priori _ information regarding the ground state which might emerge . in principle , the stability conditions for the emergence of a given phase can often be improved and extended by increasing the minimal cluster size @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the optimal ground state method , our procedure decomposes the hamiltonian in several different and non - equivalent positive semidefinite block contributions .",
    "hence the diagonalization can not be done at the level of one block hilbert space , but only for the hilbert space of the whole system ( and in this process often operators emerge which cover the whole lattice @xcite ) .",
    "this approach allows for a more efficient deduction process of unknown ground states without prior knowledge .",
    "the deduction of such type of ground states is therefore beyond the optimal ground state method .      in the present paper",
    "we investigate pentagon chain polymers ( see the example in fig .",
    "1 ) where the electrons experience local coulomb interactions on all sites ; the on - site interactions ",
    "according to the particular environment and type of atom  are permitted to differ on individual sites .",
    "the hopping parameters and the one - particle on - site potentials are prohibited to take those special values which lead to flat bands in the bare band structure . in these conditions",
    "we show rigorously that the dispersion of the correlated systems may be tuned by the interaction to become flat . thereby ferromagnetic or half",
    "metallic states at high electron densities emerge .",
    "consequently , brocks et al.s @xcite conjecture at the two - particle level , that the coulomb interaction stabilizes magnetic order in acene and thiophene is proven at the many - body level in exact terms .",
    "we demonstrate that the band - flattening effect of the interaction can occur in a large class of polymers , exceeding considerably the frame of pentagon chains .",
    "the paper not only presents details of the previously published letter @xcite , but also provides further information regarding the described procedure for the construction of exact ground states .",
    "furthermore , we explicitly demonstrate the uniqueness of the solutions in different parameter regimes , calculate the long - range hopping ground state expectation values , present exact results for spin - spin and density - density correlation functions , and analyze in details the physical origin of the deduced ordered phases .    in different approximations , band - flattening effects given by interactions on restricted @xmath64 domains",
    "have been reported previously in the literature @xcite .",
    "band flattening due to interactions has been observed as well in the case of the pam , where the same @xmath48 acts on each site , but is effective only for one band @xcite .",
    "instead , the here reported and exactly described cases produce the band - flattening effect in polymer structures over the whole first brillouin zone but requires different u values on inequivalent lattice sites .",
    "this choice accounts for the particular environment and type of atom on a paricular site inside the unit cell .",
    "the physical reasons for the emergence of the ordered phase have been analyzed with full particulars .",
    "the results show that we have found , and in our knowledge , we describe in details for the first time a new mechanism leading to the emergence of ordered phases .",
    "the valuable nature of the conclusions is guaranted by the unapproximated nature of the deduced results .",
    "the mechanism works as follows : starting from a completely dispersive bare band structure , the interactions quenches the kinetic energy  roughly at the value present in the non - interacting case  by producing an effective upper flat band .",
    "this has two advantages .",
    "first , the flat nature of the effective band , by its huge degeneracy , preserves the possibility for the system to swich easily in the ordered state dictated by the interactions present .",
    "second , the kinetic energy quench , allows to reach the ordered phase , exclusively by a drastic decrease of the interaction energy .",
    "particularly , in the present case when as interactions , different on - site coulomb repulsion values @xmath65 are present on different type of sites @xmath66 , the interaction energy decrease can be performed with extreme efficiency ( e.g. even 70 % , see sect.viii.c.2 ) .",
    "this is done by a redistribution of the double occupancy @xmath67 such to obtain high ( low ) @xmath68 where @xmath65 is low ( high ) .",
    "such decrease possibility of the interaction energy is not present when @xmath65 is homogeneous , and requires as well besides a given degree of complexity for the chain , the presence of the interaction in the ground state wave function . since in the present case",
    "the determinative decrease of the interaction energy diminishes the average number of double occupied sites , the ground state becomes ferromagnetic at half ( or above half ) filled upper effective band .",
    "the studies made on the lowest unit which provides the ferromagnetism ",
    "namely a two - cell system with periodic boundary conditions  shows that the emergence of the ferromagnetism as described above , automatically leads to a ) one electron with fixed spin projection on all sites , and b ) effective upper flat band at the interpretation of the results .",
    "we have also shown that given by a ) , when doped , the system becomes a half metal .",

    "first ( lemma 3 ) we show that the choice @xmath472 i.e. a product over @xmath95 creation operators with the same fixed spin index with one creation operator taken from each cell , leads to the state ( [ equ31],[equ32 ] ) in the form @xmath473 \\hat f^{\\dagger } |0\\rangle$ ] inside @xmath29 .    in the fourth step ( lemma 4 )",
    "we prove that the kernel @xmath29 at fixed @xmath249 and @xmath304 contains only the unique vector @xmath474 ; in the subsequent step ( lemma 5 ) we underline that states with total spin @xmath475 are not contained in @xmath29 .    for the last two steps it remains to show ( lemma 6 ) that at total spin @xmath249 , all @xmath476 $ ]",
    ", components of @xmath477 are contained in @xmath29 , and ( lemma 7 ) that @xmath29 at @xmath478 is @xmath479dimensional .",
    "hence it is concluded that @xmath213 , apart from the trivial @xmath250fold degeneracy related to the orientation of the total spin , is the unique ground state .",
    "the proof of the uniqueness at @xmath481 proceeds in a similar way as in the previous subsection for the case @xmath304 .",
    "below we present the proof for @xmath482 .",
    "we do not see reasons why the presented procedure to not work for arbitrary @xmath483 .    using the ground state from ( [ equ33 ] ) @xmath484 where @xmath301 and @xmath303 are fixed , but arbitrary .",
    "lemma 1 and lemma 2 work analogously , @xmath467 remains as shown in ( [ equ86 ] ) , taking into account that the particle number has been increased by one . for lemma 3 , @xmath474 in ( [ equ89 ] )",

    "this @xmath95fold degeneracy in ( [ equ103 ] ) is provided by @xmath487 .",
    "but for a fixed spin projection we start with @xmath232 canonical fermi operators , from which @xmath237 linearly independent @xmath488 operators are created , so @xmath95 linearly independent contributions remain for the @xmath489 degeneracy .",
    "differences are encountered also at the level of lemma 5 . since by flipping one spin in @xmath226 relative to ( [ equ90 ] ) in an arbitrary unit cell at @xmath490 , at the level of the state @xmath491 in ( [ equ93 ] ) , a doubly occupied site and an empty site appear in this cell . in order to place the ground state inside @xmath492 , the , , in principle  possibility to fill up the empty site by the additional @xmath295 electron appears .",
    "this , if possible , can be done with arbitrary spin , hence destroys the structure of ( [ equ103 ] ) and therefore also ( [ equ102 ] ) . but even if the doubly occupied site remains fixed at the place where the spin flip in @xmath226 has been introduced , the position of the empty site in different terms of @xmath491 is different .",
    "consequently , a multiplicative @xmath493 operator introduced in @xmath494 below ( [ equ93 ] ) of the form @xmath495 |\\chi_{\\sigma}\\rangle   \\label{equ104}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] does not place this vector in @xmath492 .",
    "the unique correct form is given by ( [ equ102 ] ) .",
    "this remains true even if one increases the number of spin flips in @xmath226 relative to ( [ equ90 ] ) .",
    "the unique possible total spin for @xmath496 is therefore @xmath497 and states in @xmath29 have now always this @xmath498 value .",
    "the fact that all spin sectors corresponding to @xmath497 , @xmath499 are also contained in @xmath29 is demonstrated identically as shown in lemma 6 at @xmath478 . with the changes mentioned above , lemma 7 also remains valid . in conclusion , since ( [ equ102 ] ) belongs to the spin sector @xmath486 , it is unique apart from the trivial @xmath500 degeneracy related to the orientation of the total spin , and apart from the @xmath95-fold degeneracy provided by the additional electron with reversed spin .",
    "hence the total degeneracy , and the dimension of @xmath29 is @xmath501 .",

    "indeed , at half filled upper band , using the notations introduced below ( [ equ2 ] ) , the number of electrons present in the system is @xmath503 if one has @xmath504 , one obtains @xmath505 and @xmath506 .",

    "hence , in order to understand its emergence reasons , below one concentrates on the two cells ring case .        at @xmath502 , according to ( [ eqn1 ] ) , the number of electrons in the system is @xmath508 .",
    "this means that @xmath509 1 empty site and the rest of @xmath510 sites doubly occupied holding @xmath508 electrons , or @xmath511 2 singly occupied sites and the rest of @xmath512 sites doubly occupied holding @xmath513 electrons , are the only possible electron configurations that can appear into the system . on its turn , the configuration @xmath514 can be of @xmath515 , or @xmath516 type , depending on the opposite [ i.e. @xmath517 , or parallel [ i.e. @xmath518 orientation of the spin of the two electrons present on the two single occupied sites .",

    "as presented at the subsection viii.b.2 above , the ferromagnetism is obtained by the unique configuration @xmath516 . in this configuration ,",
    "if we take @xmath392 , the @xmath522 double occupied sites provide @xmath522 electrons with spin @xmath440 , furthermore the 2 supplementary electrons on the single occupied sites have also @xmath440 spin orientation .",
    "consequently the number of spin @xmath440 electrons is equal to the number of sites in the system ( @xmath523 ) , hence on each site of the system one has one electron with spin @xmath440 , i.e. @xmath524 ( and also @xmath525 , where @xmath15 is the interacting ground state ) for all lattice sites @xmath71 and all in - cell site indices @xmath526 .      if we interpret the obtained results in a one - particle picture ( with effective bands ) , the half filled upper band and the above deduced relation @xmath527 automatically lead to an upper flat band",
    "indeed , taking into account that for @xmath502 one has @xmath528 , in this case @xmath507 bands are completely filled [ providing @xmath529 electrons with zero total spin ] , and the upper band is half filled [ providing @xmath530 electrons ] . as seen from ( [ eqn1 ] ) ,",
    "since the total number of electrons is @xmath531 , above the completely filled @xmath507 bands , only 2 electrons remain available for the upper band .",
    "taking now into account that in one fixed band , for a fixed spin projection , @xmath530 places are present , in order to have ferromagnetism ( i.e. @xmath532 ) , our upper half filled band must contain the remaining 2 electrons with the same spin projection , providing the state with minimum energy .",
    "this is possible to be fulfilled only if the upper band is flat .",

    "for the simple triangular case , the condition for the flat band emergence [ see the second line of ( f9 ) ] reads @xmath589 at @xmath590 and @xmath591 this condition provides a lowest flat band , which if half filled , give rise to a mielke - tasaki type of flat band ferromagnetism .",

    "consequently , with our procedure , in the simple triangular case , we deduce a ferromagnetic solution at half filled upper band , which is similar to the particle - hole transformed mielke - tasaki solution to the half filled upper band , hence the ground state must be interaction independent .      at mathematical level",

    "ultimately , at the level of the mathematical description , and related to our technique , this result is connected to the simple structure of the matching conditions obtained in the triangular case [ see ( f12 ) ] .",
    "in other words , the simple triangular chain case not reaches that degree of complexity , which is able to place the @xmath191 terms everywhere , so olso inside the ground state wave function .      using the technique described in sect .",
    "viii.c.2 ( see appendix d ) , we calculated also here at @xmath502 the energy variations at the emergence of the ferromagnetic state .",
    "the results are as follows :    using the parameter set @xmath598 the following results are obtained : @xmath599 consequently , the interaction energy decreases 18.2 % , the kinetic energy increases 14.14 % , all these leading to a total energy decrease of 2.82 % .    in order to not be influenced by accidental results , we have tested also other parameter set by increasing the @xmath191 values : @xmath600 this situation leads to the following results @xmath601 in this case the interaction energy decreases 19.2 % , the kinetic energy increases 14.14 % , all these leading to a total energy decrease of 24.9 % .",
    "note that @xmath191 even if not enters in the interacting ground state , as the coupling constant influences the interaction energy , and also is present in the ground state energy .",
    "as can be seen , the determinative interaction energy decrease much higher in absolute value than the kinetic energy increase is no more present here . the redistribution of double occupancy such to increase @xmath68 where @xmath65 is small and vice versa , is not effective in this case since the ground state wave function not contains the @xmath191 values",
    "consequently , now , the transition has different characteristics .        from the results presented above ,",
    "clearly can be seen that the observed ordered phase emerges because of the determinative decrease of the interaction energy .",
    "furthermore , we know that the ordered phase is ferromagnetic . consequently , the effort ( or  aim  ) of the system to produce as much as possible interaction energy decrease leads to ferromagnetism .",
    "indeed , the decrease of the interaction energy , in * r*-space means also the decrease of the number of double occupied sites , which , ( see sect .",
    "viii.b , viii.c.2 ) , taking into account that the ferromagnetic state has the lowest double occupancy , leads to ferromagnetism .",
    "it is interesting to analyze why in the present case , in order to find the emerging ordered phase , it is enough to concentrate exclusively on the interaction energy decrease without to have a look olso on possible modifications in the kinetic energy as well .",
    "the reason is related to the effective flat band emergence .",
    "namely , the system , starting from a completely dispersive bare band structure , by interaction , quenches the kinetic energy , exactly in order to be able to concentrate only on the interaction part and fully take advantage of its decreasing possibilities offered by the non - homogeneous @xmath191 values .",
    "the kinetic energy quench emerges practically at the kinetic energy value present when the interactions are turned on ( see for example @xmath602 in sect .",
    "viii.c.2 ) .",
    "this strategy is advantageous because by introducing an effective flat band  and using its huge degeneracy  , the system easily can produce the ordering dictated by the interaction terms which are present in the system .",
    "because of this reason , we expect this mechanism to occur also in the case of other orderings as well .",
    "\\a ) in order to better understand the observed ferromagnetic phase in pentagon chains at and above half filled upper band and different @xmath191 values , first we determined the smallest unit which provide a such type of behavior .",
    "this turned out to be the @xmath502 cells system ( see sect .",
    "viii.a ) . after this step we concentrated on the physical study of the @xmath502 case described with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "\\b ) from the results it turned out that the driving force of the transition is the determinative decrease in the interaction energy ( in percentage much higher in absolute value than the increase in the kinetic energy ) .",
    "this is so in pentagon chains with or without external links , antennas , or @xmath78 on - site one - particle potentials ( however these last three factors are able to increase the @xmath574 ratio ) , see sect .",
