    "the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) satellite has brought us interesting information about our universe @xcite . from the remarkably precise observation of the temperature fluctuations and the polarization of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ,",
    "one can obtain not only accurate values of the global cosmological parameters , but also invaluable information of the properties on the primordial fluctuations @xcite . although their results as a whole support the standard @xmath4cdm ( cold dark matter ) model with gaussian , adiabatic , and scale - invariant primordial fluctuations , some features that can not be explained by the standard model have also been pointed out , such as ( 1 ) lack of power on large scales , ( 2 ) running of the spectral index @xmath5 from @xmath6 on larger scales to @xmath7 on smaller scales , and ( 3 ) oscillatory behaviors of the power spectrum on intermediate scales .",
    "in fact , feature 1 was known already with cobe data @xcite , and a possible explanation was proposed @xcite .",
    "there have been many new proposals @xcite , as well as many arguments about its statistical significance @xcite .",
    "a number of inflation models that can account for feature 2 have also been proposed recently @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , feature 3 , namely , possible oscillatory behaviors around a simple power - law spectrum , is more difficult to quantify @xcite .",
    "although several attempts to reconstruct the primordial spectrum were made by combining wmap data with other independent observational data , such as the two - degree field galaxy redshift survey ( 2dfgrs ) and ly@xmath8 forest data @xcite , they all employed the binning , wavelet band powers , or direct wavelet expansion method to the data .",
    "these methods can not detect possible oscillatory behaviors if their scale is smaller than the binning scale .",
    "it is preferable to use a method that can restore the primordial spectrum as a continuous function without any ad hoc filtering scale to investigate detailed features such as 3 .",
    "fortunately , such a new method has been proposed in @xcite and @xcite , with the name cosmic inversion method , and their test calculations using mock data without observational errors have shown that this method can reproduce possible small dips and peaks off a scale - invariant spectrum quite well , in the spatially flat universe with the adiabatic initial condition . in this paper , we attempt to reconstruct @xmath0 from the wmap data using this method . to apply it to the actual data",
    ", we consider the observational errors by monte carlo simulations and use a modified cmbfast code that adopts much finer resolution than the original one in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 , so that we can compute the fine structure of angular power spectra accurately .",
    "we mention that recently another new method for the reconstruction of @xmath0 has been proposed by @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ method ] , we review the cosmic inversion method and describe our analysis method using the wmap data . in sec .  [ results ] , we apply our method to the wmap data and discuss the results . in particular , we investigate statistical significance of deviations from scale - invariance .",

    "[ conclusion ] .",
    "first , we briefly review the cosmic inversion method proposed by @xcite .",
    "we assume a spatially flat universe with an adiabatic initial condition , both of which are generic predictions of standard inflation and have been supported by the wmap data . in the end , we obtain a first - order differential equation for the primordial spectrum @xmath0 .    the cmb anisotropy is quantified by the angular correlation function defined as @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the temperature fluctuation in the direction @xmath13 .",
    "we decompose the fourier components of the temperature fluctuations @xmath14 into multipole moments , @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath9 is the comoving wavenumber , and @xmath17 is the conformal time , with its present value being @xmath18 . using @xmath19 , the angular power spectrum is expressed as @xmath20 the boltzmann equation for @xmath14 can be transformed into the following integral form @xcite : @xmath21 { \\cal v}(\\eta )   + ( \\dot{\\psi}-\\dot{\\phi } ) e^{-\\tau(\\eta ) }   \\bigl\\ } e^{ik\\mu(\\eta-\\eta_0 ) } , \\label{theta}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to the conformal time . here ,",

    "if the cosmological parameters and the angular power spectrum are given , we can solve eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) as a boundary value problem between the singularities .",
    "however , because eq .  ( [ diff ] ) is derived by adopting the approximation in eq .",
    "( [ approx ] ) , @xmath36 is different from the exact angular spectrum @xmath47 for the same initial spectrum .",
    "the errors caused by the approximation , or the relative differences between @xmath36 and @xmath47 , are as large as about 30% .",
    "thus , we should not use the observed power spectrum @xmath48 directly in eq .",
    "( [ crapp ] ) . instead , we must find the @xmath36 that would be obtained for the actual @xmath0 .",
    "of course , this is impossible in the rigorous sense , since it is the actual @xmath0 that we are to reconstruct .",
    "it turns out to be possible , however , with accuracy high enough for our present purpose , because we find that the ratio , @xmath49 is almost independent of @xmath0 @xcite . using this fact , we first calculate the ratio , @xmath50 , for a known fiducial initial spectrum @xmath51 such as the scale - invariant one .",
    "then , inserting @xmath52 , which is much closer to the actual @xmath36 , into the source term of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) , we may solve for @xmath0 with good accuracy .    in practice , we can not take the upper bound of the integration in the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) to be infinite .",
    "the integrand in eq .",
    "( [ diff ] ) is oscillating with its amplitude increasing with @xmath37 .",
    "we therefore introduce a cutoff scale @xmath53 .",
    "however , this inevitably introduces a smoothing scale to our method .",
    "as the cutoff scale is made larger , the rapid oscillations of the integrand with increasing amplitude become numerically uncontrollable . on the other hand ,",
    "if the cutoff scale is made smaller , the resolution in the @xmath9-space becomes worse as @xmath54 . in the actual calculations , to maintain as good a numerical accuracy as possible and to obtain simultaneously as fine a resolution in @xmath9-space as possible",
    ", we convolve an exponentially decreasing function into the integration of the fourier sine transform with the optimized cutoff scale of @xmath55 , corresponding to @xmath56 , or @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the resolution of the fourier sine transform is limited to @xmath58 .",
    "we could not adopt a finer resolution because of the numerical instability .",
    "nevertheless , the resolution of our method is much finer than that of any other method .",
    "note that there is an absolute theoretical limit @xmath59 , or @xmath60 , because of the finite size of the lss sphere .    in this paper",
    ", we also account for the effect of observational errors on the reconstructed @xmath0 .",
    "first , for each @xmath10 we draw a random number from a gaussian distribution whose mean value is equal to a central value of the observed @xmath61 and variance is given by the diagonal term of the covariance matrix , and then we reconstruct @xmath0 from each simulated data set .",
    "in fact , each @xmath61 is weakly correlated with other multipoles and follows a @xmath62 distribution . however , our procedure is valid because the correlation with other multipoles is weak enough and the @xmath62 distribution is practically identical to the gaussian distribution for sufficiently large @xmath10 where we analyze .",
    "we estimate the mean value and the variance of the reconstructed @xmath0 at each @xmath9 for 1000 realizations .",
    "we find that the intrinsic errors caused by our inversion method itself , whose magnitude is estimated by inverting @xmath61 spectra calculated from artificial @xmath0 spectra without observational errors , are much smaller than the observational errors of wmap , except around the singularities where the numerical errors are amplified .",
    "to calculate @xmath47 , we use a modified cmbfast code with much finer resolutions than the original one in both @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "we limit @xmath61 in the range @xmath63 in order not to use data that have large observational errors due to the cosmic variance at small @xmath10 and the detector noise at large @xmath10 .",
    "we adopt the fiducial initial spectrum , @xmath51 , as the scale - invariant spectrum , and the fiducial cosmological parameter set as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 , which are the best - fit values to the wmap data for the scale - invariant spectrum , @xmath69 . in this case , the positions of the singularities given by eq .",

    "we show @xmath0 reconstructed from the wmap data for the fiducial cosmological parameter set , namely , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 in fig .",
    "[ rewmap ] .",
    "we can see oscillations whose amplitude is about @xmath78 of the mean value with frequency @xmath79 . to check whether our method works correctly , we recalculate @xmath61 from the obtained @xmath0 in the range @xmath72 , assuming scale - invariance outside of this range , and compare it with the observational data of wmap . as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ method ] , our method reconstructs @xmath0 with a finite resolution , which is caused by the cutoff scale of the fourier sine integral . in fig .",
    "[ cut ] , we compare the cases of @xmath55 and @xmath80 , which lead to @xmath81 or @xmath82 , and @xmath83 or @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "we find that the recalculated @xmath61 spectra agree with the binned wmap data corresponding to the respective smoothing scales as shown in fig .",
    "these agreements are quite impressive .",
    "we also note that the characteristic frequency of oscillation changes accordingly as we vary the cutoff scale , so the observed oscillatory behavior with frequency @xmath79 in fig .",
    "[ rewmap ] does not necessarily have fundamental meaning .",
    "we confirm that the resolution becomes better as the cutoff scale is made larger , in agreement with the relation @xmath54 .",
    "of course , we adopt the former resolution , the finest possible scheme without numerical instability in subsequent sections .",
    "figure  [ binwmap ] demonstrates the dependence of the reconstructed @xmath0 on the bin size of the data .",
    "these @xmath0 spectra are reconstructed from the binned wmap data whose bin sizes are @xmath85 and @xmath86 , by interpolating through the binned data points , respectively .",
    "this is to see both global and local features in @xmath0 .",
    "it is found that the oscillatory feature becomes more prominent as the bin size is made smaller , even if the spectrum globally looks scale - invariant .",
    "we emphasize that such nontrivial features can not be quantified in @xmath0 as long as conventional parameter - fitting methods are used .      to examine whether the oscillatory features are real , we perform the following simulations and compare the results .",
    "first , we assume a scale - invariant @xmath0 and calculate theoretical @xmath61 spectra for the fiducial cosmological parameter set .",
    "then , we make artificial data of @xmath61 spectra with the same errors as those of the wmap data by drawing random numbers .",
    "we use these artificial data to reconstruct @xmath0 , assuming that the cosmological parameters are known .",
    "the resultant @xmath0 spectra for some different realizations are shown in fig .",
    "[ resim ] .",
    "we can see that these reconstructed spectra also have oscillatory features whose amplitude and frequency are almost the same as the @xmath0 from the wmap data .",
    "this is caused purely by the scatter of the data .",
    "in other words , even if @xmath0 is really scale - invariant , it is likely that the reconstructed @xmath0 looks oscillatory because of the observational errors , and thus it is difficult to conclude whether or not there are some significant features in the reconstructed @xmath0 from the wmap data .",
    "it is necessary to quantify their significance .    for this purpose",
    ", we define the deviation from the scale - invariance in @xmath0 in the range between @xmath87 and @xmath88 as @xmath89 ^ 2 , \\label{devi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and evaluate their statistical significance as follows .",
    "first , we calculate @xmath90 for each reconstructed @xmath0 from mock @xmath61 data for the scale - invariant @xmath0 in the same simulation as mentioned above , with the fiducial cosmological parameters .",
    "then , we estimate the probability that @xmath90 for the simulation exceeds its observed value in the same range of @xmath9 , by counting such events for 10,000 realizations . we show the results of this analysis in table  [ sig ] .",
    "it is found that only 1.41% of the simulations exceed the observed value in the range @xmath91 , and especially , only 0.39% in the range @xmath92 and 0.59% in the range @xmath93 , from which we may conclude that there are some possible deviations around @xmath94 and @xmath95 , as we can also see some prominent features in fig .",
    "[ rewmap ] .",
    "this is consistent with @xcite , who show the contribution to @xmath62 per multipole in @xmath61 after fitting the @xmath4cdm model with the power law @xmath0 to the data .      as is seen in fig .",
    "[ rewmap ] , the reconstructed @xmath0 exhibits severe oscillations , reaching negative values locally around the singularity @xmath96 .",
    "one may wonder whether this is due to an inappropriate choice of the fiducial cosmological parameters , because if the different cosmological parameters from actual values are adopted in the inversion , the reconstructed @xmath0 is distorted from the real one , especially around the singularities as shown by @xcite .",
    "we find , however , that 39.36% of the simulations based on the scale - invariant spectrum with the cosmological parameters fixed to the fiducial values result in larger values of @xmath90 in the range @xmath97 .",
    "hence , it is likely that the severe oscillations observed in fig .",
    "[ rewmap ] are not caused by an inappropriate choice of the cosmological parameters but are simply due to large observational errors .",
    "still , it is important to see the dependence of the reconstructed @xmath0 on the cosmological parameters , for the oscillatory features may change and we may be able to find a better choice of their values . in the ideal situations with sufficiently small observational errors , we may even constrain the cosmological parameters by requiring that the reconstructed @xmath0 be positive definite .",
    "figure  [ para ] depicts the dependence of the reconstructed @xmath0 on the cosmological parameters .",
    "it is found that the oscillatory features remain , but the global amplitude and especially the sharpness of the oscillations around the second singularity change .",
    "we also find some degree of degeneracy between @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 . in fig .",
    "[ para ] , we can see that the increase in @xmath98 has a similar effect as the decrease in @xmath99 or @xmath100 , that is , the amplitude of the oscillations increases similarly .",
    "this degeneracy , however , may be resolved if we could observe fine structures .",
    "for example , the reconstructed @xmath0 is practically insensitive to @xmath98 in the range @xmath101 ; hence , variation in @xmath98 may be distinguished from that of @xmath99 or @xmath100 .    with the current magnitude of observational errors in @xmath61 , we encounter negative values of the reconstructed @xmath0 for the scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "hence , we need @xmath61 with smaller errors to apply this positivity criterion directly . in any case",
    ", we should examine @xmath0 systematically for as many parameter sets as possible beyond those shown in fig .",
    "[ para ] , and we need a statistical method to quantify the positivity criterion in the presence of observational errors . this issue is currently under study .    at present , we can reconstruct @xmath0 only in the range @xmath102 .",
    "if @xmath61 data improve at @xmath103 , we will be able to obtain @xmath0 up to the third singularity , @xmath104 .",
    "this additional information on @xmath0 around the third singularity will be important for constraining the cosmological parameters , partly because of reduction in observational errors as discussed above and partly because the shape of @xmath0 around the singularities is sensitive to the cosmological parameters , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] .",
    "we have reconstructed the shape of the primordial spectrum , @xmath0 , from the wmap angular power spectrum data , @xmath61 , by the inversion method proposed by @xcite , under the assumptions that the universe is spatially flat and the primordial fluctuations are purely adiabatic .",
    "first , we have set the cosmological parameters as @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 .",
    "we have obtained an oscillatory @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude of oscillations is about @xmath78 of the mean value , and the frequency is about @xmath79 , which reflects the resolution of our method .",
    "we have also confirmed that the reconstructed @xmath0 has good accuracy in the range @xmath72 , or @xmath73 , with a resolution of @xmath105 , or @xmath106 .",
    "thus , our inversion method can reconstruct @xmath0 with a much finer resolution than other methods proposed so far , such as the binning , wavelet band powers , or direct wavelet expansion method @xcite .    to examine the statistical significance of possible nontrivial features in the reconstructed spectrum , we have generated 10,000 sets of mock cmb data from the scale - invariant spectrum and reconstructed @xmath0 from these artificial data .",
    "we have found that only 1.41% of them have the values of @xmath90 larger than the observed value in the range @xmath91 , or @xmath107 , only 0.39% in the range @xmath92 , and 0.59% in the range @xmath93 . from these results",
    "we conclude that there are some possible deviations from scale - invariance around @xmath94 , or @xmath108 , and @xmath109 , or @xmath110 . on the other hand , we conclude that the severe oscillation of the reconstructed @xmath0 around the singularity @xmath96 , which drives @xmath0 to negative values in some regions , is due not to an inappropriate choice of the cosmological parameters but to the large observational errors .",
    "this is because we find a high probability around the singularity @xmath96 , or 39.36% in the range @xmath97 .",
    "there are some issues that we plan to investigate in detail .",
    "first , it will be interesting to perform the reconstruction for a much wider range of the cosmological parameters and obtain systematic constraints on them , as mentioned in sec .",
    "[ parameters ] .",
    "second , it may be necessary to apply the @xmath90 test to other smooth forms of @xmath0 , for example , to those reconstructed from the binned data instead of the scale - invariant @xmath0 , as discussed in sec .  [",
    "binned ] , for various values of the cosmological parameters .",
    "this is because the global shape of the reconstructed @xmath0 changes depending on the cosmological parameters .",
    "third , we should extend our formalism to include the cmb polarization so that it may be applied not only to the wmap data but also to future cmb observations , such as planck .",
    "inclusion of the cmb polarization will constrain @xmath0 more severely , and if the b - mode polarization is detected , we can investigate the tensor mode of the primordial perturbations @xcite .",
