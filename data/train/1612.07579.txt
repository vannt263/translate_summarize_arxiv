    "the paper addresses the initial value problem of the wadati - konno - ichikawa ( wki ) equation , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a complex - valued function on @xmath2 .",
    "the wki equation is integrable and has an infinite number of conserved quantities .",
    "the first two conserved quantities of the wki equation are @xmath3 @xmath4 satisfying @xmath5 , @xmath6 .",
    "the two wki equations are introduced in @xcite .",
    "the first equation is and the second equation is @xmath7 which can be derived to model oscillation of elastic beams @xcite .",
    "shimizu and wadati first studied the wki equation by the inverse scattering transformation @xcite .",
    "they discovered that one soliton solution with a particular parameter becomes a bursting soliton that has infinite hight locally in space .",
    "wadati , konno , and ichikawa considered a modified version of and obtained a loop soliton solution @xcite . around the same time",
    ", the same authors showed that @xmath8 is integrable and has a cusp soliton solution @xcite , whose slope is infinite at some point .",
    "the above integrable equations admit the exotic soliton solutions that are not smooth .",
    "other well - known soliton equations of this type include the camassa - holm equation , the degasperis - procesi equation , the harry - dym equation , the short - pulse equation and so fourth .",
    "numerous results on well - posedness and wave breaking are obtained in recent years among these equations .",
    "we only list a shortlist .",
    "see @xcite for the camassa - holm equation by constantin and escher , @xcite for the degasperis - procesi equation by liu and yin , and @xcite for the short - pulse equation by liu , pelinovsky and sakovich .",
    "what above results have in common is that the global well - posedness can be achieved with some initial profile but not every initial profile in the same function space , since there exists an initial profile such that slope of a corresponding solution becomes infinity at some point in a finite time .",
    "the wki equation admits a bursting soliton whose maximum amplitude is infinity .",
    "this type of singularity differs with peakon type solutions .",
    "natural questions rise for the wki equation what conditions are required for the global existence of solution and whether blow - up phenomena can happen or not . in this paper , we address the first question by the inverse scattering method .",
    "we also derive one soliton solution as well as a bursting soliton by the framework of our matrix riemann - hilbert problem that appears to be simpler than the original derivation @xcite .",
    "more exact soliton solutions will be reported in our follow - up work .",
    "solution of the wki equation appears in the wadati - konno - ichikawa spectral problem , @xmath9\\psi , \\quad \\mathcal{m}=\\begin{pmatrix } 0 & q\\\\ -\\bar{q } & 0 \\end{pmatrix},\\ ] ] where @xmath10 .",
    "formally , given the time evolution @xmath11\\psi\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 gives the wki equation .",
    "the inverse scattering transform by shimizu and wadati @xcite is based on the gelfand - levitan equation under assumption of compact support for the potential .",
    "boiti , gerdjikov , and pempinelli studied the squared solutions of the wki spectral problem with the potential in the schwartz function space .",
    "a relationship between the ablowitz - kaup - newell - segur ( akns ) problem and the wki problem is shown in @xcite by ishimori .",
    "one soliton solution is derived for the wki evolution equations by using the known solitons of the akns evolution equations .",
    "this relationship between the anks and wki spectral problems is reported by wadati and sogo @xcite as well .",
    "however , it is hard to tell whether existence of solution for a akns evolution equation implies that of solution for a wki evolution equation since the latter solution contains the inverse power of a anks solution , e.g. , in @xcite ( equation ( 3.6 ) ) .",
    "furthermore , in @xcite ( equation ( 4.9 ) ) , the isotropic heisenberg equation is related to the wki equation whose solution contains the inverse power of the former .",
    "this is not the case for relation of the isotropic heisenberg equation to the nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "we study the scattering and inverse scattering maps for the potential @xmath14 in weighted sobolev spaces .",
    "we follow the machinery of the riemann - hilbert approach by deift and zhou @xcite .",
    "their work on long - time asymptotics of the defocusing nls @xcite also contains many important details of the method . at present",
    "we are unable to close regularities of the potential @xmath14 in a single space under the scattering and inverse scattering maps .",
    "we , therefore , require the infinite smoothness of the potential @xmath14 in order to conclude the solvability of the wki equation by the inverse scattering transform .",
    "existence of local solution of can be obtained in the same smooth space .",
    "we denote @xmath15 as the space of square integrable functions equipped with the norm , @xmath16 we will denote @xmath17 as the function space defined by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is the weak partial derivative . when @xmath21 , we have @xmath22 every function in @xmath23 is smooth and any @xmath24 th derivative of a function with a weight @xmath25 belongs to @xmath26 .    from theorems [ b - a - regularity ] and [ construct - q ] , the potential @xmath27 after a composition of the scattering and the inverse scattering maps is @xmath28    as corollary , the following result is obtained .",

    "the solution implied in theorem [ main - theorem ] has no soliton solution because of the smallness condition on an initial data .",
    "it is worth mentioning that theorem [ main - theorem ] requires infinite smoothness of an initial data , and it would be interesting to see existence of local / global solution in lower regularity for the wki equation .",
    "we note that our work can be readily extended to the study of long - time asymptotic solution by using the steepest descent method .",
    "we expect that the leading order decays in the order of @xmath33 , since the wki equation is formally written as the nonlinear schrodinger type equation if @xmath34 is small . as for other evolution equations from the wki hierarchy ,",
    "the long - time asymptotic solution of the short - pulse equation is recently reported in @xcite .    in the scattering problem",
    ", there are mainly three important steps for technical aspects , ( i ) transformation of the wki spectral problem to the anks spectral problem for existence , analyticity , and estimates of the fundamental solutions , ( ii ) the change of spectral parameter @xmath35 for correct normalization , ( iii ) the change of the spatial variable that depends on the dependent variable to eliminate the potential @xmath14 in the jump condition of the riemann - hilbert problem .",
    "this type of transformation in ( iii ) is called the reciprocal transformation or the hodograph transformation in many literatures , e.g. , see @xcite for integrable discretizations of the wki elastic beam equation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section [ wki - akns ]",
    ", we transform the wki spectral problem to the akns type spectral problem . from the anks type spectral problem ,",
    "we obtain various results and relate them back to the wki spectral problem . in section [ scattering - coefficients ] , we introduce the scattering coefficients @xmath36 and @xmath37 and give their regularity based on regularity of the potential @xmath38 in theorem [ b - a - regularity ] .    in section [ inverse - transformation ] , we make the change of the spectral parameter , @xmath39 , and give the sectionally analytic matrix function that is normalized to identity at infinity .    in section [ change - space - variable ] , we introduce the change of the spatial variable to address an appearance of the potential @xmath14 in the jump condition . the new spatial variable will be denoted as @xmath40 and the new potential as @xmath41 that depends on @xmath40 .",
