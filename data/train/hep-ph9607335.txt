    "during the last few years , a considerable amount of work has been dedicated to the possibility of generating a sizeable baryon asymmetry on the electro - weak phase transition ( see for example @xcite ) . for an excess of baryons to develop in an universe which initially has zero baryon number ,",
    "the already well known following conditions , first enucianted by sakharov , must be met : 1 ) some interaction of elementary particles must violate baryon number .",
    "2 ) c and cp must be violated in order that there is not a perfect equality between rates of @xmath0 processes , since otherwise no asymmetry could evolve from an initially symmetric state .",
    "3 ) a departure from thermal equilibrium must play an essential role , since otherwise cpt would assure compensation between processes increasing and decreasing the baryon number .",
    "remarkably , the standard model of weak interactions may provide all the necessary ingredients for baryogenesis .",
    "in particular the third condition can be met if the weak phase transition is at least weakly first order .    in a first order phase transition , the conversion from one phase to the other occurs trough nucleation .",
    "this happens when the system is either supercooled or superheated .",
    "bubbles of the  true  phase ( with an expectation value of some higgs field @xmath1 ) expand rapidly absorbing the region of the  false  phase ( @xmath2 ) . at the bubble surface",
    "there is a region or  wall ",
    ", in principle of microscopic dimensions , which separates the phases .",
    "the speed of the expanding bubble walls could be in the range @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "particles in the  false  ( higher temperature ) phase are reflected off the advancing bubble walls , while most particles in the low temperature phase are unable to catch up with the receding walls , and can not equilibrate across the phase boundary .",
    "thus one has a departure from equilibrium and a baryon asymmetry can be generated .",
    "in the physical conditions of the early universe the fermions moving through the bubble wall will interact also with the particles in the surrounding plasma , thus a full transport problem must be considered .",
    "a useful simplifying assumption is to decompose the process into two steps , one describing the production of the cp asymmetry on the transmission / reflection coefficients when the quarks / antiquarks are scattered on the wall , the second describing the transport and the eventual transformation of the cp asymmetry into a baryon asymmetry via the baryon number anomaly .    assuming that the scattering from the wall is little affected by diffusion corrections , the effects of the surrounding plasma can be partially incorporated by introducing a higgs field effective potential taking into account finite temperature corrections to the tree - level potential .",
    "the structure of the wall depends on this effective potential on a complicated way .",
    "fermions passing through the domain wall acquire a mass which is proportional to the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of the higgs field , which is determined from the equations of motion of the finite temperature effective action of the bubble .",
    "the problem of computation of transmission coefficients reduces to the solution of a dirac equation with a space dependent mass term .",
    "exact solutions has been obtained only for two simple cases : for a wall profile approximated by a step function ( @xcite ) and for an average higgs field profile of the type ( @xcite ) : @xmath4 where the width of the wall is given by @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the higgs mass .",
    "this profile is the analytic solution of the higgs field equation for a bubble with its normal along the z - axis and position at @xmath7 under some simplifying assumptions .",
    "there is not variation of the complex phase of the higgs field through the wall .",
    "numerical solutions have been obtained for some more complicated profiles which incorporate locally dependent complex phases and which are considered to be ",
    "reasonable  enough although not neccesarily solution of any equation of motion ( for example in @xcite ) .    for a given wall profile , parallel to the x - y plane and normal to the z - axis in its own rest frame , in order to compute the reflection coefficient one need only the plane wave solutions of the dirac equation for particles moving along the z - axis . for any other incoming direction ,",
    "the problem can be reduced to the latter performing an appropriate lorentz boost .",
    "following @xcite , it is advantageous to work in the chiral basis , reordering the spinorial components the dirac operator can be factorized into @xmath8 blocks . for solutions with positive energy e @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are eigenspinors of the chirality operator , @xmath12 , for the eigenvalue @xmath13 and @xmath14 for @xmath15 , we obtain the two equations @xmath16 with @xmath17    we will deal in this work with the particular case given by the function @xmath18 all the constants are supposed real .",
    "this function represents a linear phase variation with a global difference of @xmath20 over a distance of the order of the wall thickness @xmath21 .",
    "it would be possible to solve eqs.([e1102]-[e1101 ] ) with the function given by eq.([e1103 ] ) , reducing them to a bessel - like differential equation .",
    "it is possible and advantageous however to use perturbation theory to compute the evolution operator of the system .",
    "the summation to all orders of the perturbation expansion is possible thanks to the special form of @xmath22 .",
    "there are two main advantages in doing so : the first one is that the procedure is easily generalizable to any number of dimensions ( for example to incorporate mixing between generations ) , the second one is that the evolution operator is computed directly and the reflection coefficients are easily given in terms of its components . a similar technique has been used already in ( @xcite ) to compute the neutrino oscillation probabilities in solar matter .    the evolution operator of the differential system ( [ e1102 ] )",
    "is given by the path - ordered integral @xmath23 in this work we are concerned with an operator @xmath24 of the form @xmath25 with @xmath26    @xmath27 are in general complex . the real part of @xmath28 is greater than zero .",
    "it can be set @xmath29 without loss of generality .",
    "formally , it is possible to solve eq.([e102 ] ) by successive iterations :    @xmath30    @xmath31 is the well - known integral @xmath32    the domain of integration is defined by @xmath33    following the same arguments as in @xcite one can show that it is enough to compute u in the @xmath34 limit .",
    "the evolution for finite time can be deduced from the expression for this limit .",
    "trought elementary manipulations of eq.([e101 ] ) , we get the elements of @xmath31 in a basis of eigenvectors of @xmath35 : @xmath36 with @xmath37 . @xmath38 one of the two eigenvalues of @xmath35 .    due to the dimensionality of the problem and the special form for v , the summatory in eq.([e1107 ] ) either is zero or reduces to only one term depending on whether n is odd or even and on the states @xmath39 . for diagonal terms ( @xmath40 )",
    "the product of @xmath41 is always zero when n is odd .",
    "when n is even there is a single surviving term . for non - diagonal terms ,",
    "the situation is reversed : the only one surviving term appears for n odd .",
    "this single remaining term is always of the alternating form @xmath42 .",
    "so , @xmath43    all the functions appearing in the integral @xmath44 are of exponential type , the following equality ( @xcite ) can be applied : @xmath45    in our case    @xmath46    @xmath47 can take only the values @xmath48 .",
    "@xmath49 is @xmath28 or @xmath50 .",
    "one have for the integers @xmath51 : @xmath52 or @xmath53 .    for the diagonal terms , @xmath40 , @xmath54 even ( writing @xmath55 ) :",
    "@xmath56 } \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\frac{\\exp z_0 ( n/2)(s+s^\\ast ) } { ( s+s^\\ast)^{n/2 } \\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right ) !",

    "are given in units of @xmath71 , the inverse of the wall thickness .",
    "to obtain @xmath72 , evolution operator for the eq.([e1101 ] ) , one must make the changes @xmath73 .",
    "the matrix become @xmath74 with @xmath75    see appendix a for some new formulas for the absolute values of generalized hypergeometric functions which can be obtained from the general properties of @xmath76 .",
    "following the same reasoning used in ( @xcite ) , using the general properties of the evolution operator , the evolution for any finite z is given by the matrix @xmath77 in this work , we will make use only of the infinite time limit .",
    "we will follow the same procedure as in ( @xcite ) for defining the reflection coefficient . in the region @xmath78 , the eigenspinors @xmath79 correspond to right - moving particles with chirality @xmath80 respectively .",
    "the solutions @xmath81 are identified with left - moving particles with chirality @xmath82 .",
    "these states are also eigenstates of the hamiltonian in this region    the momentum eigenstates for @xmath83 are obtained diagonalizing the constant matrix @xmath84 by @xmath85 with eigenvalues @xmath86 .    for left - moving particles incident from the symmetric phase ,",
    "two components coexist at @xmath87 , the incident particle itself and the reflected one by the domain wall .",
    "we define reflection coefficients @xmath88 as @xmath89 imposing the boundary condition that at @xmath83 only a left - moving particle with momentum @xmath90 propagates , one gets the expression : @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a momentum eigenspinor .",
    "then , the reflection coefficient is given by @xmath93 or more explicitly : @xmath94 and similarly for @xmath95 .",
    "we are interested in the asymmetry between the reflection probabilities . the quantity @xmath96 is displayed in figs.([f1]-[f3 ] ) as a function of the diverse parameters involved @xmath97 and for different values of the product particle mass x wall width @xmath98 .    in fig.([f1",
    "] ) the asymmetry a is plotted as a function of the dimensionless quantity @xmath99 and some fixed values of @xmath100 . for",
    "@xmath101 ( plot b ) the results obtained here coincide with the numerical result obtained in @xcite ( fig .",
    "2 ) . as the phase difference",
    "@xmath20 increases , the height of the peaks keeps unaltered but their position moves according to the rule @xmath102 the first parameter of the hypergeometric functions in eqs.([e6023]-[e6025 ] ) is real for these peak values .",
    "as the value of @xmath100 gets higher some resonant effect becomes apparent , the peaks get sharper and the asymmetry is only non - negligible around the peaks .",
    "this is particularly evident in the last plot ( c ) .",
    "this effect could lead to an essentially monochromatic asymmetry in scenarios with highly oscillatory or random phase differences .    in fig.([f2 ] ) we check the influence of the value of the phase @xmath103 .",
    "the plot ( a ) corresponds to plot ( c ) in fig.([f1 ] ) .",
    "here we have set @xmath104 .",
    "some new dips appear at lower @xmath105 , otherwise the position and width of the peaks remain unaltered . in the plot ( b ) we present the variation of a ( peak values at @xmath103 ) in a full cycle of @xmath103 .",
    "the phase @xmath103 appears only in the multiplicative exponential coefficient of @xmath106 in formula ( [ e6024 ] ) . from this , the soft , quasi - sinusoidal behavior observed in the graphic is understood .    finally in fig.([f3 ] ) we plot a as a function of the parameter @xmath100 , for @xmath103 fixed and for different values of the product @xmath107 as before .",
    "as expected the peaks in the asymmetry function appear for values such that @xmath108    as conclusion , we were able to solve the dirac equation with a space dependent complex mass term which , although not a solution of the equations of motion , reproduces the expected variation in module and in complex phase of the average higgs field across the wall . from the solution of the dirac equation",
    "the particle - antiparticle transmission asymmetry is computed .",
    "the analytical results presented here confirm previous numerical computations and predict an unexpected behavior for highly oscillatory phase fields .",
    "we note that with little modifications our method can be used to solve the dirac equation for a purely local dependent phase mass term ( @xmath109 in eq.([e1103 ] ) or equivalently @xmath28 purely imaginary in eq.([e1110 ] ) ) . in order to circumvent convergence problems",
    "this must be done taking the limit @xmath110 in the finite propagation time eq.([e1125 ] ) .",
    "the generalized hypergeometric function ( @xcite ) is defined by              for a @xmath24 as given by eq.([e6009 ] ) is traceless , @xmath118 , or @xmath119 . the formulas ( [ e6024 ] ) are valid for any @xmath120 real , @xmath121 complex , we obtain : @xmath122 to be compared with the similar formulas obtained in ( @xcite ) for the absolute values of the generalized hypergeometric functions @xmath123 .",
    "in fact , with little changes , one could compute u for any general matrix v with diagonal terms equal to zero and non - diagonal terms of general exponential type not neccesarily equal . in the particular case of v hermitic : @xmath124 , @xmath125 is unitary and of the form @xmath126 with @xmath127 given by eq.([e6023 ] ) .    by the unitarity of the matrix ( [ e6027 ] ) , @xmath128 .",
    "and we get the formula : @xmath129 for @xmath130 this formula reduces to the special case involving the well known bessel functions of order @xmath131 : @xmath132 ."
