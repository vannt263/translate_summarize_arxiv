    "after the discovery of the higgs boson in july 2012 @xcite , a solution to the hierarchy problem  the question why the electroweak scale is so much lower than the planck scale  is more urgently needed than ever . among the numerous possibilities to solve the hierarchy problem ,",
    "the most popular approach is low - scale supersymmetry .",
    "a promising alternative is given by models with a warped extra dimension @xcite , in which the standard model ( sm ) is embedded in a slice of anti - de sitter space , while the higgs field is localized on the `` infra - red ( ir ) brane '' , one of the two four - dimensional hyper - manifolds that bound the extra dimension .",
    "these so - called randall - sundrum ( rs ) models can provide a natural explanation for this vast hierarchy , since the fundamental ultra - violet ( uv ) cutoff is the warped planck scale , which near the ir brane takes values in the tev range . moreover",
    ", by allowing the fermion fields to propagate into the bulk , warped extra - dimension models can also provide an explanation for the hierarchies observed in the flavor sector @xcite and the smallness of flavor - changing neutral currents @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , none of the kaluza - klein ( kk ) particles predicted in extra - dimensional extensions of the sm have been observed yet , and electroweak precision measurements indicate that these particles are probably too massive for a direct detection at the lhc .",
    "thus , indirect searches like the precision measurements of the higgs - boson couplings to sm particles , which are accessible via studies of both the higgs production cross section and its decay rates , become more and more attractive . concerning warped extra dimensions , especially the loop - mediated higgs couplings to gluons and photons",
    "could give hints about the existence of additional kk particles . while the gluon - fusion process has been discussed extensively in several works @xcite ,",
    "the present paper focuses on the higgs decay into two photons , which was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the first analysis of the effects of the kk tower of the @xmath2 boson on the @xmath1 amplitude was performed in @xcite .",
    "the first complete calculation of the @xmath7 decay rate , in which both the yukawa couplings to the @xmath8-even and @xmath8-odd fermions were included , was performed in @xcite .",
    "it was found in this paper that the higgs decay rate into two photons is enhanced relative to the sm due to the effect of the kk fermions , which turned out to give the dominating correction . at about the same time , an independent analysis of the @xmath7 decay rate came to the opposite conclusion @xcite .",
    "an explanation for these deviating results was first given in @xcite , followed by a five - dimensional ( 5d ) analysis in @xcite , which found that the two results belong to two different scenarios of the rs model .. up to different factors for the color multiplicity and electric charges , an analogous discussion holds for the quark and lepton kk - tower contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "] while these papers focused on the contribution stemming from the fermionic kk states , in the present work we provide a detailed analysis of the bosonic loop contributions to the @xmath7 amplitude , which in unitary gauge stem from the @xmath2 bosons and their kk excitations .",
    "the advantages of this approach are that we are able to derive an exact result , which includes the full dependence on the higgs - boson mass and holds to all orders in @xmath3 , where @xmath9 is the higgs vacuum expectation value ( vev ) , and @xmath10 sets the mass scale for the low - lying kk excitations of the sm particles .",
    "it is also straightforward to extend our formulas to the case where the higgs boson lives in the bulk of the extra dimension .",
    "our approach also allows us to carefully study the effects of the fifth components of the gauge fields , whose profiles are discontinuous on the ir brane , similar to the @xmath8-odd fermion profiles which indeed require a careful treatment .",
    "our paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : pre ] we define the set - up and comment on the necessity to distinguish between the so - called brane - higgs and narrow bulk - higgs scenarios when calculating the fermionic loop contributions to the @xmath11 and @xmath1 amplitudes . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we discuss the general structure of the @xmath7 amplitude and summarize the results for the fermionic contributions from charged quarks and leptons propagating in the loop .",
    "we then focus on the bosonic loop contributions , calculate them in the kk - decomposed theory and show that the result for the contributions of each individual kk mode is gauge invariant .",
    "in the next step we resum the kk towers and derive an exact formula for the @xmath7 amplitude in terms of an overlap integral over the higgs - boson profile and the transverse part of the 5d gauge - boson propagator , including the exact dependence on the higgs - boson mass . to the best of our knowledge , such a formula has not been obtained before .",
    "we derive an explicit , closed expression for the 5d propagator and show that the overlap integral is insensitive to the precise details of shape of the higgs - boson profile , once this profile is localized very close to the ir brane . by expanding our results in powers of @xmath3 , we can identify the contributions from the @xmath2 bosons ( with modified couplings to the higgs boson ) and their kk towers , confirming the results of @xcite . in section  [ sec : custodial ]",
    "we generalize our findings to an extended version of the rs model with a custodial symmetry protecting electroweak precision observables @xcite .",
    "again , we obtain an exact formula for the @xmath7 amplitude and , for the first time , for the 5d gauge - boson propagator in the custodial rs model .",
    "when expanded to order @xmath3 , our findings for the contributions of the @xmath2 boson and its kk excitations are consistent with the findings of @xcite .",
    "phenomenological implications of our results in the context of the latest lhc data are discussed in section [ sec : pheno ] , where we study the higgs decay into two photons in two different versions of the minimal and the custodially protected rs model .",
    "we illustrate the magnitude of the effects as a function of the mass of the lightest kk gluon state and the scale of the 5d yukawa couplings , and derive the regions in parameter space that are already excluded by recent lhc measurements .",
    "our main results are summarized in the conclusions .",
    "we focus on rs models where the electroweak symmetry - breaking sector is localized on or near the ir brane .",
    "the extra dimension is chosen to be an @xmath12 orbifold parametrized by a coordinate @xmath13 $ ] , with two branes localized on the orbifold fixed - points at @xmath14 ( uv brane ) and @xmath15 ( ir brane ) .",
    "the rs metric reads @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 with @xmath18 is referred to as the warp factor , and the size @xmath19 and curvature @xmath20 of the extra dimension are assumed to be of planck size , @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 measures the size of the extra dimension and is chosen to be @xmath23 in order to explain the hierarchy between the planck and the tev scales . with the help of the curvature @xmath20 and the warp factor evaluated at the ir brane , @xmath24 , one defines the kk mass scale as @xmath25 . on the right - hand side of we have introduced the dimensionless coordinate @xmath26 defined by @xmath27 $ ] , by the rescaling @xmath28 . ] which will be used throughout this work .",
    "our paper deals with the minimal rs model based on the sm gauge group , as well as with an extended rs model with a larger bulk gauge group , which after electroweak symmetry breaking includes an @xmath29 custodial symmetry protecting the @xmath30 parameter and suppressing larger corrections to the @xmath31 couplings @xcite . in both versions of the rs model , all fermions and gauge bosons are allowed to propagate into the bulk , resulting in infinite towers of heavy kk copies of the sm particles .",
    "in contrast , the scalar sector is assumed to reside on or near the ir brane so as to provide a solution to the hierarchy problem .",
    "we recall that rs models are effective field theories valid up to a position - dependent uv cutoff @xcite @xmath32 at this scale , gravity becomes strong and the model needs to be uv - completed into a theory of quantum gravity . the fact that rs models are defined with an inherent uv cutoff can be used to distinguish between different scenarios for the localization of the higgs sector .",
    "we shall consider a scalar field @xmath33 localized on or very near the ir brane .",
    "its profile along the extra dimension is described by a normalized distribution @xmath34 with width @xmath35 . for @xmath36",
    "this profile becomes a @xmath37-function , corresponding to a strictly brane - localized scalar field .",
    "following @xcite , we introduce the characteristic width of the higgs field along the extra dimension as @xmath38 .",
    "if the inverse width is larger than the inherent uv cutoff near the ir brane , @xmath39 , then the higgs profile can not be resolved by the high - momentum modes contained in the effective lagrangian of the rs model , and hence for all practical purposes such a scalar field can be regarded as a _ brane - localized higgs field_. on the other hand , if the inverse higgs width is smaller than the cutoff scale , then the modes of the effective theory can resolve its profile , and we speak of a _ bulk higgs field_. while calculations in generic bulk - higgs models are rather complicated , it has been shown in @xcite that there is the possibility of obtaining analytical results for the special case of a _ narrow bulk - higgs field _ , whose inverse width is such that @xmath40 .",
    "as has been explained in @xcite , the fermionic loop contributions to the @xmath11 and @xmath1 amplitudes are sensitive to the details of the localization mechanism , and indeed the results obtained in a brane - localized higgs scenario @xcite differ significantly from those derived for a narrow bulk - higgs field @xcite .",
    "we thus need to distinguish between the two types of localization mechanisms in our phenomenological analysis .",
    "as we will show , however , the bosonic contributions to the @xmath1 amplitude are insensitive to the precise localization of the scalar sector and approach an unambiguous result in the limit where @xmath35 .",
    "our goal is to calculate the @xmath7 decay amplitude entirely in terms of the 5d propagators for both gauge bosons and fermions .",
    "while the contributions from quarks and charged leptons can be easily deduced from the corresponding results for the @xmath11 amplitude , a detailed consideration of the gauge - boson contribution has not yet been performed in 5d language .",
    "our approach in the present work is the following : in a first step , we calculate the bosonic contributions to the @xmath7 amplitude in the kk - decomposed , 4d effective theory and show that at each kk level the sum of all diagrams is gauge - invariant .",
    "the only contributing diagrams in unitary gauge are those with vector bosons propagating in the loop .",
    "we can then rewrite the amplitude , summed over kk states , as an expression involving the 5d gauge - boson propagator in the mixed momentum - position representation @xcite .",
    "we show that in the limit of a very narrow higgs profile the amplitude approaches an unambiguous value , which is insensitive to the details of the higgs localization mechanism . at the end of this section",
    ", we employ our exact results to derive expressions for the contributions of the zero modes ( the standard @xmath2 bosons ) and their infinite towers of kk excitations to the @xmath1 amplitude .",
    "we begin with the calculation in the minimal rs model with the sm gauge group in the bulk , broken to @xmath41 on the ir brane , where the higgs field develops a vev .",
    "details for the implementation of the higgs , gauge - boson , and gauge - fixing sectors in the context of this model and using our notations have been given in @xcite , while appendix  [ app : fr ] includes a summary of the relevant feynman rules needed for our analysis .",
    "here , it suffices to mention that we decompose the 5d @xmath2-boson field into 4d mass eigenstates @xmath42 where @xmath43 are the kk modes of the @xmath2 bosons with masses @xmath44 .",
    "the scalar particles @xmath45 are `` unphysical '' in the sense that they provide the longitudinal degrees of freedom of the @xmath2 bosons ( @xmath46 ) and the massive @xmath2-boson kk modes ( @xmath47 ) , and thus they can be gauged away .",
    "indeed , the scalar fields @xmath48 mix with the charged goldstone bosons arising from the higgs sector . assuming for the time being that the scalar sector is localized on the ir brane , we parameterize the higgs doublet after electroweak symmetry breaking in the usual form @xmath49 throughout this paper , @xmath9 denotes the higgs vev in the rs model , which differs from the sm value @xmath50 by a small amount @xcite .",
    "we determine @xmath9 from the shift to the fermi constant derived in the rs model by considering ( at tree level ) the effect of the exchange of the infinite tower of kk gauge bosons on the rate for muon decay , using the definition @xmath51 .",
    "this yields @xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 in the minimal rs model .",
    "when we generalize our analysis to the case of an extended rs model with a custodial symmetry in section  [ sec : custodial ] , this relation will still hold , but the parameter @xmath54 will then take on a non - trivial value .",
    "the decomposition of the scalar fields @xmath55 into the mass eigenstates @xmath45 reads  @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the leading contribution to the @xmath2-boson mass in an expansion in powers of @xmath3 .",
    "the relation between the two parameters can be written as @xcite @xmath58 , \\ ] ] where once again @xmath53 in the minimal rs model .",
    "since the profile of the zero mode is flat up to corrections of order @xmath3 , it follows that @xmath59 is close to  1 , and hence the fields @xmath55 coincide with @xmath60 to leading order . mixing effects arise at order @xmath3 and higher",
    ". note also that one can adjust the gauge - fixing lagrangian so as to cancel any mixings between @xmath61 and the scalar fields @xmath48 and @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "the one - loop feynman diagrams contributing to the @xmath1 decay amplitude are shown in figure  [ fig : alldiagrams ] for a general @xmath0 gauge . in the subsequent section",
    "we will demonstrate that the full amplitude is gauge invariant . in the unitary gauge only the diagrams @xmath62@xmath63 contribute .",
    "in order to present our results , we find it convenient to parametrize the @xmath7 amplitude , including the contributions from sm particles , by means of two wilson coefficients @xmath64 and @xmath65 define via @xmath66 where @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",
    "each wilson coefficient can be written as a sum of three terms , @xmath69 where in a general gauge @xmath70 includes the bosonic contributions from gauge bosons , scalar bosons , and ghosts .",
    "the calculation of these bosonic contributions is the main subject of this work .",
    "the fermionic loop contributions due to virtual quarks and leptons shown in diagram @xmath71 can be readily deduced from expressions derived in @xcite .",
    "they will be summarized in section  [ subsec : fermions ] .",
