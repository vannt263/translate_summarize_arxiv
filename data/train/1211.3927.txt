    "around the year 1970 people started to think about how to determine the four complex helicity amplitudes for pseudoscalar meson photoproduction from a complete set of experiments . in 1975",
    "barker , donnachie and storrow  @xcite published their classical paper on ` complete experiments ' .",
    "after reconsiderations and careful studies of discrete ambiguities  @xcite , in the 90s it became clear that such a model - independent amplitude analysis would require at least 8 polarization observables which have to be carefully chosen .",
    "there are plenty of possible combinations , but all of them would require a polarized beam and target and in addition also recoil polarization measurements .",
    "technically this was not possible until very recently , when transverse polarized targets came into operation at mainz , bonn and jlab and furthermore recoil polarization measurements by nucleon rescattering has been shown to be doable .",
    "this was the start of new efforts in different groups in order to achieve the complete experimental information and a model - independent partial wave analysis  @xcite .",
    "a complete experiment is a set of measurements which is sufficient to predict all other possible experiments , provided that the measurements are free of uncertainties .",
    "therefore it is first of all an academic problem , which can be solved by mathematical algorithms . in practise , however , it will not work in the same way and either a very high statistical precision would be required , which is very unlikely , or further measurements of other polarization observables are necessary .",
    "both problems , first the mathematical problem but also the problem for a physical experiment can be studied with the help of state - of - the - art models like maid or partial wave analyses ( pwa ) like said . with high precision calculations",
    "the complete sets of observables can be checked and with pseudo - data , generated from models and pwa , real experiments can be simulated under realistic conditions .",
    "experiments with three types of polarization can be performed in meson photoproduction : photon beam polarization , polarization of the target nucleon and polarization of the recoil nucleon .",
    "target polarization will be described in the frame @xmath0 , see fig .  1 , with the @xmath1-axis pointing into the direction of the photon momentum @xmath2 , the @xmath3-axis perpendicular to the reaction plane , @xmath4 , and the @xmath5-axis is given by @xmath6 . for recoil polarization ,",
    "traditionally the frame @xmath7 is used , with the @xmath8-axis defined by the momentum vector of the outgoing meson @xmath9 , the @xmath10-axis is the same as for target polarization and the @xmath11-axis given by @xmath12 .",
    "the photon polarization can be linear or circular .",
    "for a linear photon polarization @xmath13 in the reaction plane @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",

    "but there is always an unknown overall phase , e.g. @xmath44 , which can not be determined by additional measurements .",

    "even with the help of unitarity in form of watson s theorem , the angle - dependent phase @xmath44 can not be provided .",
    "this has very strong consequences , namely a partial wave decomposition would lead to wrong partial waves , which would be useless for nucleon resonance analysis .",
    "it becomes obvious in the following schematic formula @xmath62 where the desired partial wave @xmath63 can not be obtained from the reduced helicity amplitudes @xmath64 alone , as long as the angle dependent phase @xmath65 is unknown .",
    "our main goal in the data analysis of photoproduction is the search for nucleon resonances and their properties . to better reach this goal ,",
    "one can directly perform a partial wave analysis from the observables without going through the underlying helicity amplitudes .",
    "such an analysis would be a truncated partial wave analysis ( tpwa ) with a minimal model dependence ( i ) from the truncation of the series at a maximal angular momentum @xmath66 and ( ii ) from an overall unknown phase as in the case of the amplitude analysis in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , in the tpwa the overall phase would be only a function of energy and with additional theoretical help it can be constrained without strong model assumptions .",
    "such a concept was already discussed and applied for @xmath67 in the 80s by grushin  @xcite for a pwa in the region of the @xmath68 resonance .",
    "formally , the truncated partial wave analysis can be performed in the following way .",
    "all observables can be expanded either in a legendre series or in a @xmath69 series @xmath70 where @xmath71 denote the 4 possible electric and magnetic multipoles for each @xmath72 angular momentum @xmath73 , namely @xmath74 . for an @xmath54 truncation @xmath75",
    "there are 4 complex multipoles @xmath76 leading to 7 free real parameters and an arbitrary phase , which can be put to zero for the beginning . in table",
    "[ tab : obs ] we list the expansion coefficients for all observables that appear in an @xmath54 wave expansion .",
    "already from the 8 observables of the first two groups @xmath77 one can measure a set of 16 coefficients , from which we only need 8 well selected ones for a unique mathematical solution .",
    "this can be achieved by a measurement of the angular distributions of only 5 observables , e.g. @xmath78 or @xmath79 . in the first example one",
    "gets even 10 coefficients , from which e.g. @xmath80 and @xmath81 can be omitted . in the second case ,",
    "there are 9 coefficients , of which @xmath81 can be omitted . in practise",
    "one can select those coefficients , which have the smallest statistical errors , and therefore , the biggest impact for the analysis by keeping in mind that all discrete ambiguities are resolved .",
    "as has been shown by omelaenko  @xcite the same is true for any pwa with truncation at @xmath66 .",
    "for the determination of the @xmath82 free parameters one has the possibility to measure @xmath83 coefficients for types @xmath84 , respectively .",
    "in a first numerical attempt towards a model - independent partial wave analysis , a procedure similar to the second method , the tpwa , described above , has been applied  @xcite , and pseudo - data , generated for @xmath85 and @xmath86 have been analyzed .",
    "events were generated over an energy range from @xmath87  mev and a full angular range of @xmath88 for beam energy bins of @xmath89  mev and angular bins of @xmath90 , based on the maid2007 model predictions  @xcite .",

    "the example using 6 observables @xmath102 is demonstrated , where no recoil polarization has been used . as explained before , such an experiment would be incomplete in the sense of an ` amplitude analysis ' , but complete for a truncated partial wave analysis . in fig .",

    "the fitted se solutions are very close to the maid solution with very small uncertainties for the @xmath92 partial wave .",
    "for the @xmath94 partial wave we obtain a larger statistical spread of the se solutions .",
    "this is typical for the @xmath95 multipole , which is generally much more difficult to obtain with good accuracy  @xcite , because of the weaker sensitivity of the observables to this magnetic multipole .",
    "but also this multipole can be considerably improved in an analysis with 8 observables  @xcite .",
    "it is shown that for an analysis of @xmath103 resonances , the amplitude analysis of a complete experiment is not very useful , because of an unknown energy and angle dependent phase that can not be determined by experiment and can not be provided by theory without a strong model dependence .",
    "however , the same measurements or even less will be very useful for a truncated partial wave analysis with minimal model dependence due to truncations and extrapolations of watson s theorem in the inelastic energy region .",
    "a further big advantage of such a pwa is a different counting of the necessary polarization observables , resulting in very different sets of observables . while it is certainly helpful to have polarization observables from 3 or 4 different types , for a mathematical solution of the bilinear equations one can find minimal sets of only 5 observables from only 2 types , where either a polarized target or recoil polarization measurements can be completely avoided .",
