    "recently , much attention has been attracted by the class of two - dimensional ( 2d ) graphene systems , which consist of one or a few layers of carbon atoms  @xcite .",
    "their unusual properties provided the impetus to suggest many potential applications as electronic materials  @xcite .",
    "one of the key properties of graphene devices is that their electric conduction can conveniently be switched on and off .",
    "this aim has been achieved in several ways , including breaking the symmetry of a graphene sheet by depositing it on a substrate  @xcite , controlling its band structure by doping  @xcite , and adjusting the electronic properties of a graphene bilayer by applying an external electric field perpendicular to the surface  @xcite . among these methods ,",
    "the latter is most promising since the electric field can easily be manipulated and the process is reversible .",
    "it has been proven that the gap of a graphene bilayer can be tuned continuously from zero to mid - infrared energies by changing the strength of the field  @xcite .",
    "besides the electric field , also the stacking sequence of graphene layers influences the electronic structure of this material @xcite .",
    "two stacking types , ( ab ) or bernal stacking with hexagonal symmetry and ( abc ) stacking with rhombohedral symmetry , exist besides a disordered fraction both in natural and in synthesized graphite  @xcite . here and in the following",
    "we denote the general stacking types with ( ab ) and ( abc ) , and specific stacks with ab ( bilayer ) , aba or abc ( trilayer ) , etc .",
    "recent work using the tight - binding approach was carried out to investigate the effect of the thickness of ( ab)-type films including single - layer graphene on their @xmath4-band overlap  @xcite and to study the effect of an external electric field on few - layer ( ab)-graphene  @xcite .",
    "koshino  @xcite compared the tight - binding electronic structures of ( ab ) and ( abc ) stacks in electric field and found that a gap is opened in ( abc ) stacks while ( ab ) stacks with more than two layers stay semimetallic in the field .",
    "band structures of both ( ab)- and ( abc)-type few - layer systems obtained by density - functional theory ( dft ) calculations were examined by latil and henrard  @xcite ( without external electric field ) and by aoki and amawashi  @xcite ( with external electric field ) .",

    "the existence of abab and abca stackings in tetralayer graphene was recently proved by infrared absorption spectroscopy in combination with tight - binding calculations ; no other tetralayer stackings were found  @xcite .",

    "@xcite . obviously , bernal - type graphite ( @xmath6-graphite ) is energetically more stable than rhombohedral graphite ( @xmath2-graphite )  @xcite and has been studied much more intensely than the latter .    the most important structural difference between ( ab)- and ( abc)-type stackings is that the ( ab ) stacking shows straight lines of @xmath7 bonds connecting all atoms of one sub - lattice perpendicular to the layers through the whole stack , whereas in the ( abc ) stacking only single pairs of atoms are connected perpendicular to the layers , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ab_vs_abc ] . in other words , in ( ab ) stacks there are two kinds of atoms , one with dangling @xmath7 bonds in both @xmath8-directions and the other without any dangling bonds , whereas in ( abc ) stacks each atom has one dangling @xmath7 bond , either in positive or in negative z - direction .",
    "evidently , this difference must have a large impact on the structure of the @xmath4-bands .",
    "the present paper is devoted to a comprehensive study of the electronic structure and the dielectric response of stacks of graphene by means of high - precision dft calculations combined with a topological analysis at tight - binding level . while the focus lies on the hitherto less",
    "intensely studied rhombohedral stacks including bulk @xmath2-graphite , comparison with ab - bilayers and other bernal stacks is made in appropriate places below .",
    "computational details with emphasis on the correct treatment of external electric fields applied to 2d slabs are outlined in section ii .",
    "section iii a contains a critical comparison of the ab - bilayer band gap versus external electric field with related literature data and the low - energy band structure of few - layer ( abc ) systems with and without field .",
    "the low - energy states are characterized as surface states in section iii b. further , we provide evidence that ( abc ) slabs have a gap in their bulk - like states only up to a critical thickness .",
    "a detailed band structure of bulk @xmath2-graphite is shown and discussed in critical comparison with literature data . in section iii c , we discuss the topological distinction between rhombohedral stacks and bernal stacks .",
    "the former are shown to possess topologically protected zero - energy surface states .",
    "next , the field - induced charge densities of bi- and 6-layer systems and an analysis of induced dipole moments for single- and bilayer systems are provided in section iii d. the analysis of the electric field response is continued in section iii e by comparing the field - induced charge transfer with the chemical charge transfer , in section iii f where conclusions for the modelling of the dielectric response of graphene stacks are drawn , and in section iii g where local densities of states without and with external field are shown .",
    "the field - dependent dielectric constant of few - layer stacks is presented in section iii h. finally , the main results are summarized and conclusions are drawn in section iv . earlier arguments by aoki and amawashi  @xcite concerning a better electric tunability of ( abc ) stacks compared with ( ab ) stacks are confirmed and extended .",

    "dft calculations have proven to be powerful in predicting the ground state properties of various systems , including three - dimensional ( 3d ) bulk and 2d thin films without and with external electric field . in this context , 2d films are frequently modeled by forming a 3d system from periodically stacked slabs with vacuum regions in between .",
    "there is however one severe problem with a straight application of the supercell approach for 2d slabs in self - consistent calculations with external fields .",
    "the field - induced dipole moment of a single slab causes a potential difference between the vacuum regions on the two sides of the slab .",
    "this induced potential difference would break the translational invariance of the supercell .",
    "it is , thus , compensated by a linear potential term forced by the periodic boundary conditions in a straight application .",
    "this linear term is not harmful in the vacuum region but it _ reduces _ the induced ( screening ) potential inside the slab and thus _ enhances _ the effective external field to a degree depending on the ratio between vacuum and slab thickness .    in order to avoid these problems , kunc and resta",
    "@xcite applied a sawtooth - like external potential with symmetric teeth of alternately rising and descending flanks .",
    "this potential can be implemented by introducing alternately positive and negative capacitor plates into the vacuum regions . in this model ,",

    "( see also a similar approach in ref .  )",
    "proposed to use an asymmetric external sawtooth potential with ascending flanks followed by jumps .",
    "they introduced artificial dipole layers in the vacuum region to compensate the induced dipole moments .",
    "although both methods produce a periodic potential , which provides _ in principle _ the same electronic structure within the periodic slabs as within a single slab , there are inaccuracies if the vacuum region is not wide enough , and the extra discontinuities in the effective potentials worsen the convergence of fourier transformation - based 3d methods .    within the fplo ( full - potential local - orbital ) approach  @xcite ,",
    "tasndi recently implemented a single - slab method which guarantees the correct boundary behavior in the vacuum region  @xcite .",
    "like in similar isolated - slab methods  @xcite , the advantages of this approach are the following : ( 1 ) there are no side effects of any artificial periodicity , ( 2 ) the external electric field is smooth everywhere , and ( 3 ) the electrostatic properties can be calculated correctly without any dipole correction .",
    "most of the presented results , in particular the data of table  [ table : excess - electrons ] and of all figures except figs .",

    "also , the energy difference between the dirac points amounts to 0.6 mev ( fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - bilayer ] ) vs. 0.8 mev ( ref .  ) .",
    "an important difference is , however , that in ref .   the intersection of both bands ( the `` dirac point '' ) at the k - point coincides with the fermi energy , leaving only a hole pocket on the line @xmath0-k",
    "this is not correct because the volume of the electron- and hole - pockets must be equal in neutral carbon stacks .",
    "in order to get an accurate fermi energy we chose the @xmath34-grid in such a way that at both intersection points of the two bands mesh points for the linear tetrahedron method are located . then the linearly interpolated bands , which are used for the calculation of the density of states , reproduce the real band structure around the band intersections as good as possible . to be specific , a mesh with @xmath35 points in the 2d fbz was used to obtain the accurate position of the fermi level in fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - bilayer ] . in order to achieve reasonable resolution in fig .",
    "[ fig : dos - bilayer ] , a special mesh of @xmath36 points was employed .",
    "this mesh was chosen such that it fills only about 0.1% of the 2d fbz around the k - point , the only region where states in the energy window of interest are present .",
    "the simplest two - parameter tight - binding model for the bilayer ( considering only @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) provides a semi - metal with two touching parabolas at the k - point  @xcite , leaving no fermi surface at all .",
    "if additionally @xmath37 is taken into account , the bands show the two `` dirac cones '' , but both have the same energy ( namely the fermi energy ) and there is no fermi surface without doping  @xcite . our result , fig .",
    "[ fig : bs - bilayer ] , means that the prediction of a lifshitz transition to a gap - less state  @xcite , which rests on a band structure model including only these 3 overlap integrals , has to be revisited . on the other hand , the numerical tight - binding approach in ref .   which considered the 7 most important overlap integrals from bulk graphite shows an energy difference in the two cusps , but in the opposite order compared with the self - consistent dft approaches ( i.e. the crossing at point k is higher in energy than the other one ) . in other words ,",
    "ref .   provides a hole pocket around k unlike the electron pocket in our self - consistent dft approach .",
    "consequently we have to state , that the mev - features and the topology of the fermi surfaces are very delicate and tight - binding results using overlap parameters from bulk graphite may not agree with the results from self - consistent dft calculations .",
    "a similar conclusion was drawn for the abc trilayer case in ref .  .",
    "[ fig:3dbs - bilayer ] shows the band structure of an ab - bilayer close to the fermi level in a 3d representation .",
    "the hole pocket on the @xmath0-k line is nearly elliptical ( with the axis along @xmath0-k being 3 times longer than perpendicular to it ) and the electron pocket around k is roughly a circle with a slight deformation maintaining a three - fold symmetry according to the symmetry of the band structure at the k point .",
    "an estimate using a model with linear dispersion and circular ( electron pocket around k ) and elliptical ( hole pocket on @xmath0-k ) iso - energy curves provides for the number of holes ( which equals the number of electrons ) in the pockets the tiny value of @xmath38 per unit cell , or equivalently , @xmath39 per atom .",
    "the density of states ( dos ) at the fermi level obtained from the same model is for both holes and electrons ( which need not to be equal ) approximately @xmath40 states per ev per unit cell .",

    "thus , we predict a positive curvature of the low - field band - gap vs. field dependence for rhombohedral stacks with three and more layers , where the non - linearity increases with the number of layers .      an intriguing trait of the electronic structure of finite ( abc ) stacks is that all states in the vicinity of the fermi energy are localized near the two surfaces .",
    "this was recently demonstrated for stacks of arbitrary thickness by tight - binding model calculations  @xcite .",

    "a crucial point is that the wave functions belonging to the states of close proximity to the fermi energy are strongly localized at the slab surfaces , whereby each band is localized on one surface . at the k symmetry point",

    "[ fig : transfer ] and [ fig : ldos-5l ] ) . as shown in @xcite for the 4-layer system , the corresponding singularities in the joint density of states",
    "are clearly seen in infra - red absorption spectra and can be used to identify the stacking order of stacks prepared by exfoliation .",
    "-layer ( abc)-type graphene systems versus @xmath26.,scaledwidth=80.0% ]    we are aware of the fact that a general response relation in inhomogeneous systems should include nonlocal effects , @xmath113 therefore , for the extraction of the full information about the dielectric response function @xmath114 from a finite field calculation we had to apply @xmath115-dependent external fields @xmath116 . the local field corrections included in eq .",
    "( [ dep - epsilon - nonlocal ] ) imply that even for a constant external field the internal field @xmath117 is @xmath118-dependent . because it is numerically extremely difficult to extract the full information about @xmath114 from a finite field approach , we here use a mesoscopic description by a dielectric constant ( dc ) @xmath119 which is independent of @xmath120 within the slab . to this end",
    ", we follow macroscopic electrodynamics and determine a spatially averaged internal field @xmath121 from @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the dipole moment per volume , induced by the homogeneous external field @xmath26 . for the definition of the volume of the @xmath42-layer slab we used a thickness of @xmath124 .",
    "thus , @xmath125 . we consider only the @xmath8-components of @xmath123 , @xmath26 , and @xmath126 , since by symmetry the other components are zero .    the next point to note is that the gap was found to be strongly dependent on the strength of @xmath26 , see fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvse ] .",
    "this implies that also @xmath119 should be strongly field dependent .",
    "thus , we take a differential definition , @xmath127 the more commonly used alternative of a power expansion of @xmath117 in @xmath26 with field-_independent _ expansion coefficients is not suited for strong nonlinearities , in particular in cases like ours where the gap depends strongly on the external field and for vanishing field the system is ( semi)metallic .    in order to establish a relation with eq .",
    "( [ eq : eav ] ) , we define an averaged dc @xmath128 via integration of eq .",
    "( [ def - epsilon - lin ] ) , @xmath129 using eq .",
    "( [ eq : eav ] ) , we find @xmath130 despite the somewhat loose connection to the fully non - local dielectric response function , @xmath128 provides exact information about the induced dipole moment per surface area .    as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsvse ] , @xmath131 decreases with increasing @xmath26 .",
    "this trend can be understood from the fact that the gap width grows monotonously with the external field in the considered field range , fig .",
    "[ fig : gapvse ] . another trend also seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : epsvse ] is the increase of @xmath128 with increasing number of layers @xmath42 for fixed external field .",
    "for @xmath48 this trend can be qualitatively explained with the same argument as before , since the gap width decreases with increasing @xmath42 .",
    "obviously the opening of a gap by an external field is the harder the thicker the slab is .",
    "the bilayer @xmath132 is an exception , because in this system there is no next - neighbor inter ",
    "layer interaction .",
    "an interesting application is offered by the distinct values of @xmath128 for a relatively large range of external field values .",
    "namely , a measurement of @xmath128 should allow to discriminate the number of layers and , perhaps , also the stacking type .",
    "such a discrimination was only recently achieved by synchrotron - based infrared absorption - spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "we should finally mention the small absolute value for the dc of the bilayer system , about 2.7 in the considered field range .",
    "this is well below the value for @xmath133 , @xmath134 , and might be relevant for fast nano- or molecular electronics .",
    "we performed a dft investigation of the electronic structure and of the electric - field response of ( abc)-stacked graphene slabs with finite thickness . for comparison ,",
    "related calculations were carried out for single layer graphene , ab - bilayer , 5-layer and 6-layer ( ab)-slabs . further , the electronic structure of bulk @xmath2-graphite was clarified .",
    "the main results can be summarized as follows : + ( i ) the abc - trilayer is a zero - gap semi - conductor , but all other ( abc ) slabs up to 10 layers thickness and also bulk ( abc ) graphite ( @xmath2-graphite ) are semi - metals .",
    "thus , very probably _ all _ ( abc)-slabs with more than 3 layers are semi - metallic .",
    "+ ( ii ) we confirmed that in ( abc ) slabs up to at least 10 layers thickness only surface states are located at the fermi energy and provided a topological argument based on a tight - binding hamiltonian that this should hold for layer thickness larger than 10 as well .",
    "this means , that electronic transport parallel to such slabs is confined to a surface region .",
    "another , more general implication arising from our topological argument is that conducting zero - energy modes also should appear at grain boundaries between ( ab ) and ( abc ) stacking and at domain walls separating ( abc ) from ( cba ) regions .",
    "since finite - thickness ( abc ) stacking is common both in natural and in synthesized graphite , the electric conductance of graphite should be very sensitive to the specific amount of stacking domain walls and grain boundaries .",
    "+ ( iii ) the band structure of the ab - bilayer has been thoroughly revisited .",
    "we found on the mev - scale a tiny electron pocket around the k - point and a hole pocket on the line k-@xmath0 close to k. thus , already an undoped ab - bilayer has a finite fermi line , in contrast to results from tight - binding calculations with up to three hopping parameters and in agreement with other dft results .",
    "we found that mev - features and the topology of the fermi surfaces are very delicate .",
    "thus , tight - binding results using overlap parameters from bulk graphite may on the low - energy scale considerably differ from self - consistent dft results .",
    "+ ( iv ) band structures of several few - layer ( abc ) slabs and of bulk ( abc ) graphite were presented and critically compared with available literature data .",
    "the low - energy band structure of bulk @xmath2-graphite consists of two dirac - like cones above and below the fermi level with an energy distance of 9 mev .",
    "since for few - layer ( abc ) slabs there is a gap in the bulk - like states , we conclude that there is a critical thickness @xmath1 beyond which ( abc ) slabs are _ bulk _ semi - metallic .",
    "+ ( v ) ( abc)-stacked graphene systems with @xmath45 layers were found to open a band gap in external electric fields , which increases with the electric field strength in the considered range up to 0.1 v /  .",
    "+ ( vi ) the strong electric - field dependence of the electronic structure of ( abc ) slabs yields a related field dependence of the dielectric response . a properly defined field - averaged dielectric constant @xmath128 decreases with increasing external field .",
    "both the band gap and the dielectric constant are determined by the number of graphene layers and systems with different numbers of layers show different tuning ratios @xmath135 for the dielectric constant .",
    "these properties provide a chance to choose a specific graphene system according to application requirements .",
    "vice versa , the specific dielectric response can be used to identify the number of layers in ( abc ) stacks and , perhaps , even be used to discriminate the stacking sequence .",
    "+ ( vii ) the ab - bilayer shows a remarkably small value of the static dielectric constant of about @xmath136 .",
    "so small a value might be of interest for fast nano- or molecular electronics .",
    "+ ( viii ) although not investigated quantitatively in this paper , it is obvious that in ( abc ) slabs the strong dependence of the gap on the perpendicular field will lead to a strong dependence of the conductivity parallel to the layer on the perpendicular field .",
    "+ ( ix ) the local density of states was presented both for the ab - bilayer and for an abcab - stack .",
    "this information can be useful for the identification of a certain stack by infrared absorption spectroscopy .",
    "+ ( x ) we found that the screening properties of finite - thickness graphene stacks resemble neither those of traditional metals nor those of traditional insulators . for the ab - bilayer ,",
    "the inter - layer charge transfer and the induced atomic intra - layer dipole moments contribute nearly equally to the total induced dipole moment . in the thicker slabs ,",
    "the screening charge per layer induced by an external field shows a rapid decay toward the interior of the slab .",
    "more than @xmath137 of the induced charge is located in the very surface layers , where it is distributed roughly equally over the lattice sites within the layer cell . on the other hand , the induced intra ",
    "layer dipole moments decay on a much larger length - scale .",
    "the latter contribution is not included in simplified screening models .",
    "consequently , such models can provide only qualitative results .",
    "+ ( xi ) whereas ( abc)-stacked slabs show chemical charge transfer only near the surface , in the ( ab ) stacks this transfer is largest in the interior and decreases toward the surface .",
    "the electrons are transfered from the atoms with saturated @xmath7 bonds toward atoms with dangling bonds .    as a bottom line",
    ", we note that ( abc ) stacks rather than ( ab ) stacks with more than two layers may turn out to be of potential interest for applications relying on the tunability of electronic properties by an external electric field .",
    "such slabs with rhombohedral stacking have non - metallic bulk - like states up to a large critical thickness and topologically protected zero - energy surface states .",
    "thus , they open a tunable gap in an external field which can additionally be tailored by the choice of the layer thickness . beyond this practical aspect , many interesting features are expected both for pure @xmath2-graphite micro - crystals as well as for graphite with controlled embeddings of ( abc ) stacks .",
