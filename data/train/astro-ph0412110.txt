    "the  blue stragglers \" were first identified by sandage ( 1953 ) in the globular cluster m3 . since their discovery , blue stragglers have been found in many other globular clusters , and in open clusters as well .",
    "the frequency of blue stragglers is also correlated with position in clusters , being generally higher in the denser , more dynamically evolved portions , indicating that stellar interactions , perhaps stellar mergers or hardening of binaries leading to mass transfer , may be the cause or at least one of the causes of the phenomenon ( mateo et al .",
    "hut et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , stryker ( 1993 ) , livio ( 1993 ) , trimble ( 1993 ) , bailyn ( 1995 ) , and leonard ( 1996 ) have provided extensive reviews of blue stragglers in globular clusters .",
    "some globular clusters show declining frequencies ( per unit luminosity ) of blue stragglers in their lower density outer regions , but others ( m3 : ferraro et al .  1993 , 1997 ;",
    "m55 : zaggia et al .",
    "1997 ; 47  tuc : ferraro et al .",
    "2004 and mapelli et al .",
    "2004 ) show an enhanced frequency in the outermost , lowest density regions .",
    "this is explained qualitatively by invoking two different mechanisms for the creation of blue stragglers in clusters . in the central regions ,",
    "dynamical effects involving collisions may enhance the probabilities for creating blue stragglers ( sills & bailyn 1999 ) . in the outer regions ,",
    "normal stellar evolution may be responsible for their creation .",
    "a variety of stellar evolution explanations have been proposed to explain such unusual systems , one of which ( mass transfer : mccrea 1964 ) does not require any alterations to standard stellar evolution theory . but two explanations ( pulsation - driven mass loss : willson , bowen , & struck - marcell 1987 ; internal mixing : wheeler 1979a , b ; saio & wheeler 1980 ) do require significant modifications and make the understanding of the blue straggler phenomenon of high importance . the mass transfer model is perhaps favored by the increasing blue straggler frequencies seen in the outer regions of the above clusters because that is where binary systems are most likely to survive .",
    "mapelli et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , for example , were able to reproduce the blue straggler binary frequency distribution in 47  tuc using a combination of collisional creation of blue stragglers and survival of mass transfer systems .",
    "the collisions , as expected , dominate the central regions , while the outer regions blue stragglers arise both from collisions and mass transfer in binary systems .",
    "preston & sneden ( 2000 ; hereafter ps2000 ) expanded on the earlier work of preston , beers , & shectman ( 1994 ; hereafter pbs ) and argued that _ field _",
    "blue stragglers are created almost solely by the mass transfer process . not only does this make good qualitative sense , but they supported the argument by noting that field blue stragglers are much more common per unit luminosity than are blue stragglers in the lower - density regions of globular clusters .",
    "as ps2000 noted , this is consistent with the idea that even in those low density regions of clusters , binary systems may have been destroyed , thereby lowering the numbers of blue stragglers .    in clusters",
    ", we must keep in mind that even the stars found in the low - density outer regions may be vulnerable to stellar encounters if their intra - cluster motions carry them into the central higher density regions .",
    "field blue stragglers therefore provide the  cleanest \" sample for the study of the mechanism that may create such stellar oddities via stellar evolution , independent of environment .",
    "the distributions of such observables as binary stars periods and orbital eccentricities are therefore much less likely to have been among field stars than in clusters .    as we describe below , however ,",
    "field star samples have introduced another puzzle , one at least as intriguing as the blue straggler phenomenon itself .",
    "we argued ( carney et al .",
    "2001 ; hereafter cllgm ) and argue again here that binary star evolution and mass transfer is one path for the creation of blue stragglers , and apparently the most common among field stars .",
    "however , some metal - poor main sequence field stars that are hotter than globular cluster main sequence turn - offs are not binaries , but could be explained as the partial remnants of an accreted dwarf satellite galaxy whose star formation continued over a long period of time .",
    "following pbs , we distinguish between stars with delayed evolution and those that are simply young stars .",
    "we regard the blue straggler phenomenon as the process(es ) that delay(s ) normal stellar evolution .",
    "pbs identified a significant number of field metal - poor stars bluer than comparable metallicity globular cluster main sequence turn - off stars : candidate blue stragglers , in other words .",
    "preston & landolt ( 1998 ) found that the star cs  @xmath1 is a very metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath2 ) sx  phe pulsating variable , and is also a binary star with an orbital period of 431 days and a relatively low orbital eccentricity of 0.10 .",
    "( sx phe variables lie in the instability strip s extension to the main sequence domain , and thus represent the hotter blue stragglers in globular clusters : see nemec , nemec , & lutz 1994 for a discussion and lists of such stars . )",
    "the orbital properties are a vital clue to its origin because the normal orbital eccentricity of main sequence binary stars is much higher , with @xmath3e@xmath4 close to 0.37 ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 , latham et al .",
    "2002 ) , independent of metallicity .",
    "an extensive study of blue metal - poor field stars by ps2000 found a surprisingly high fraction of binary stars , which led them to suggest that many of them were field blue stragglers .",
    "many of these stars showed periods of hundreds of days with low orbital eccentricities , as in the case of cs  @xmath1 .",
    "cllgm identified ten metal - poor field blue straggler candidate stars from the large survey of carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , based on colors that were slightly to significantly bluer than globular cluster main sequence turn - offs ( at similar metallicities ) .",
    "they found six of the stars to have periods in this same range , 167 to 844 days , and low orbital eccentricities ( @xmath5 ; @xmath6 ) .",
    "they argued that these periods and eccentricities are consistent with mass transfer .",
    "they noted that mass transfer systems such as ch , subgiant ch , and dwarf carbon stars likewise have very high binary fractions and that those binary systems have similarly long orbital periods and low orbital eccentricities .",
    "sneden , preston , & cowan ( 2003 ; hereafter spc2003 ) have strengthened the argument for mass transfer in their recent abundance analyses of six blue metal - poor stars from the ps2000 program , finding that the three constant velocity stars have normal element - to - iron abundance ratios for metal - poor stars , but that three binary stars show major enhancements of carbon and @xmath7-process elements , indicative of mass transfer from a highly - evolved agb star . in summary , then , mass transfer appears to be the primary cause of the blue straggler phenomenon among field stars .",
    "therefore , it may also be a major contributor to the formation of blue stragglers in clusters , although the situation there is more complicated by induced dynamical evolution of binary stars as well as outright capture and merger of stars .",
    "since the orbital characteristics are such an important component of the mass transfer model , more velocity data of known field blue stragglers and identification of additional candidates and their binary frequency and orbital characteristics are highly desirable .",
    "it is also important to employ consistent techniques for identifying candidate blue stragglers and for determining the orbital elements of the binary stars . in the latter case",
    ", we note that our criteria for identification of binaries and acceptance of final orbital solutions are more strict than those of some investigators ( see latham et al .",
    "1988 , latham et al .",
    "1992 , and latham et al .",
    "this has compelled us to re - evaluate the orbital solutions available in the literature , using the published velocity data , in order to re - analyze all the velocity data in a consistent manner .",
    "thus , while ps2000 found 42 binaries among their 62 program stars , we could unambiguously identify only 29 stars as being binaries using their published velocities and our software and experience .",
    "the other 13 stars may indeed be binaries , but our criteria and experience lead us to believe that additional radial velocities are needed to confirm such identifications .",
    "we also note that for some stars , ps2000 did not have enough time coverage to obtain a unique orbital period and offered alternative solutions when necessary .",
    "we have retained for use in this paper only the ten stars from ps2000 whose orbital elements satisfy our criteria . in all these cases , our orbital solutions are indistinguishable from those obtained by ps2000 .",
    "spc2003 have also addressed this point with additional radial velocity data for selected stars .",
    "we are confident that additional observations will resolve any remaining uncertainties .",
    "we add that g.  preston ( priv .",
    "comm . ) has obtained additional velocities for cs  @xmath8 and cs  @xmath9 , and those results confirm the orbital solutions for those stars presented by spc2003 .    for this paper , we have chosen to concentrate our efforts on seeking additional stars , rather than refinements of existing orbital solutions presented by ps2000 .",
    "the exciting results of spc2003 provides another motivation : a larger sample , and of brighter stars , could enable further progress in the search for chemical signatures of mass transfer , and , perhaps , an understanding of different mass transfer mechanisms ( e.g. , red giant or agb donor star ? ) .",
    "finally , we have not lost sight of perhaps the most intriguing discovery of pbs : they argued that many of their stars are merely masquerading as blue stragglers and that they may , in fact , be bona fide young , metal - poor stars , accreted perhaps from a small dwarf galaxy which had experienced a prolonged star formation history or perhaps a relatively recent burst of star formation .",
    "candidate field blue straggler stars may therefore provide clues to both stellar evolution and the evolution of our galaxy .",
    "we have two challenges in identifying metal - poor blue stragglers in the field population .",
    "the first is the rarity of such stars .",
    "large samples of field stars must be studied to find those few that are bluer than the main sequence turn - off of comparable metallicity globular clusters , and we must also be assured that they are main sequence stars and not the more luminous blue horizontal branch stars .",
    "thus accurate colors , reddenings , gravities , and metallicities are required for large numbers of stars .",
    "this is why the two major recent studies of metal - poor field blue stragglers have emerged from the  bmp \" ( blue metal poor ) studies like that of pbs and ps2000 , and the  carney - latham - laird - aguilar \" survey ( carney et al .",
    "1994 ; cllgm ) .",
    "such methods pick up both true blue stragglers as well as any truly young metal - poor stars , which may have been acquired by the galaxy during a minor merger event ( pbs ) , as noted above .    in their study of 62 blue metal - poor stars ,",
    "many of which qualify as blue straggler candidates using our color criterion , ps2000 found an abnormally high fraction of binary stars , roughly four times higher than those of the disk and halo populations ( duquennoy & mayor 1991 ; latham et al .",
    "1988 , 2002 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the frequency of double - lined systems was unusually low , suggesting a population of underluminous secondary stars , possibly white dwarfs .",
    "such evidence , plus a low fraction of binary systems with short orbital periods , and a very high fraction of binary systems with low orbital eccentricities , suggested to ps2000 that their large sample of blue metal - poor stars is a mixture of both relatively young stars , with , presumably , a normal frequency of binary stars and with orbital elements like those of galactic disk and halo stars , plus a significant number of blue stragglers whose origin is most readily explained by mass transfer .",
    "lithium is a very `` fragile '' element , vulnerable to proton capture at the relatively low temperature of order @xmath10  k. cool stars , with deep enough convection zones , may transport surface lithium to depths where lithium can be destroyed , thereby gradually depleting the lithium abundance in the photosphere . in metal - poor main sequence stars , lithium abundances are observed to decline with effective temperature for @xmath11  k ( see thorburn 1994 and references therein ) , presumably due to the deeper convection zones for such stars .",
    "the same effect is seen in metal - poor subgiants ( pilachowski , sneden , & booth 1993 ) . however , among the hotter main - sequence dwarfs and subgiants , lithium abundances in metal - poor stars show a near - constant value of log  n(li )  =  2.2 , which is often referred to as the  spite plateau \" , after its discovery by spite & spite ( 1982 ) .",
    "there is now an extensive literature on lithium abundances in metal - poor stars ( see spite , molaro , & spite 1993 and ryan et al .",
    "2001 for additional observations and references ) .",
    "mass transfer ( or mixing or pulsation - driven mass loss , for that matter ) should lead to depletion of surface lithium abundances . indeed , lithium is not found in many candidate blue stragglers studied to date ( hobbs & mathieu 1991 ; pritchet & glaspey 1991 ; glaspey , pritchet , & stetson 1994 ; cllgm ) . on the other hand",
    ", normal lithium abundances have been found in some stars that are blue straggler candidates , suggesting that they are either blue stragglers created by an as - yet unidentified mechanism , or truly younger metal - poor stars ( ryan et al .",
    "2001 ; cllgm ) .",
    "we therefore include in table  1 the lithium abundances for our program stars , insofar as they have been determined by others .    alas , the lithium abundance may not be entirely capable of distinguishing a field metal - poor blue straggler star ( low lithium ) from a young metal - poor dwarf ( normal lithium ) . in the hyades cluster , boesgaard & trippico ( 1986 ) and boesgaard & budge ( 1988 ) found that lithium abundances are very depleted in main sequence stars with effective temperatures lying roughly in the range of 6400  k to 6800  k. this  lithium gap \" , if it arises during the evolution of normal metal - poor main sequence stars , could lead us to confuse a young but otherwise normal metal - poor dwarf with a metal - poor blue straggler .",
    "we discuss this further in section 5.2 .",
    "spc2003 discovered strong enhancements of elements probably created by @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis in three stars that satisfy the color conditions described below .",
    "these abundance anomalies speak strongly to mass transfer , and also the evolutionary state of the donor star , and hence we have searched the literature to determine what is known about the abundances of two elements which are often associated with @xmath7-process nucleosynthesis , strontium and barium .",
    "these abundances are also summarized in table  1 .",
    "we rely once more on a large sample of field stars to select our program stars .",
    "stetson ( 1981 ) primarily used proper motion criteria to select possible high velocity stars from the sao catalog , and obtained a list of high - velocity early - type stars ( stetson 1991 ) .",
    "based on high - resolution spectra , glaspey , pritchet , & stetson ( 1994 ) found that these stars could be divided into three broad groups of stars , one of which is relevant to metal - poor field blue stragglers . their table  4 ( part _ iii _ ) includes six metal - poor stars that are also deficient in lithium .",
    "one of these stars , sao  80390 ( bd+25  1981 ) was studied by cllgm , and found to be a possible radial velocity variable .",
    "the other five stars constitute our new sample .    in table  1",
    "we provide the basic photometric and chemical information for these five stars , plus the ten blue straggler candidates from cllgm , and the ten metal - poor ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath12 ) stars from ps2000 for which cllgm could obtain satisfactory orbital solutions using their software and generally more conservative criteria .",
    "the de - reddened @xmath13 values , effective temperatures , and metallicities for the ps2000 stars were taken from that paper , while for bd+23  74 , hd  8554 , hd  109443 , and hd  135449 , the values were taken from or determined using data taken from stetson ( 1991 ) and glaspey et al .",
    "values for the remaining stars were determined following the same precepts discussed by carney et al .",
    "( 1994 ) . in figure  1",
    "we show the color selection criterion for blue straggler candidates . as discussed by cllgm , the solid line represents a second - order polynomial fit to the de - reddened @xmath13 color indices of selected globular cluster main sequence turn - offs as a function of metallicity . because the tail of the field star metallicity distribution extends to lower metallicities than that of the globular clusters ,",
    "we have also employed the ",
    "y@xmath14 \" isochrones ( kim et al .",
    "this use of the isochrones is far from rigorous since we ignore color shifts that may be required to bring the isochrones into agreement with observed cluster color - magnitude diagrams .",
    "further , we have made the convenient , perhaps naive , assumption that all globular clusters have the same age .",
    "we simply chose the isochrones with enhanced abundances of the  @xmath15 \" elements , [ @xmath15/fe ] = + 0.3 , and then chose the cluster ages to all be 11 gyrs , represented by the dashed line in figure  1 .",
    "this provides a reasonable match to the edge of the color distributions of the field stars over a wide range of metallicities , especially at the lowest metallicities , and a good match to the actual globular cluster turn - off distribution near the peak of the halo metallicity distribution ( [ m / h ] @xmath16 @xmath17 ) .",
    "stars blueward of _ both _ of these lines are considered blue straggler candidates .",
    "note that cs  @xmath18 does not satisfy this criterion , and we exclude it from the following discussions .",
    "[ tab1 ]    the normal stars , not known to be blue stragglers , are plotted as plus signs .",
    "however , compared to our earlier work ( cllgm ) , we have increased the number of normal stars for comparison .",
    "we have completed and are preparing for publication an additional sample of 470 metal - poor field stars selected from ryan ( 1989 ) and ryan & norris ( 1991 ) .",
    "three of those stars , g121 - 54 , bd@xmath19  3682 , and ltt  15049 ( = hd  154578 ) , plotted as plus signs but bluer than the two dividing lines , are now blue straggler candidates .",
    "we will report on their radial velocity behavior in a future paper .",
    "we have also continued our observations of the four  constant velocity \" stars in our earlier paper , bd+72  94 , bd+40  1166 , bd+25  1981 , and hd  84937 , and report the revised results as well .",
    "the observations were made using the same procedures as described by cllgm .",
    "we employed the center for astrophysics ( cfa ) digital speedometers ( latham 1985 , 1992 ) on the multiple mirror telescope and 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the whipple observatory atop mt .",
    "hopkins , arizona , and on the 1.5-m wyeth reflector located in harvard , massachusetts .",
    "the echelle spectrographs were used with intensified photon - counting reticon detectors and recorded about 45    of spectrum in a single order centered near 5187   .",
    "the resultant resolution was about 8.5  kms@xmath20 .",
    "typical signal - to - noise values ranged from from 7 to 50 per resolution element .    radial velocities were measured from the observed spectra using the one - dimensional correlation package * rvsao * ( kurtz & mink 1998 ) running inside the iraf environment .",
    "as before , we used a grid of synthetic spectra calculated using the model atmospheres computed using r.  l.  kurucz s code atlas9 .",
    "the details of the calculation of the models and the grid of synthetic spectra were presented by cllgm .    for each of the five new blue straggler candidates we adopted a template from the grid of synthetic spectra with the effective temperature and metallicity nearest to the values for that star reported in table  1 .",
    "we used @xmath21 throughout .",
    "we computed correlations for all spectra of each star using all the available rotationally broadened synthetic spectra with the most appropriate temperature , gravity , and metallicity . to determine the radial velocity , we chose the rotationally - broadened template with the value of that gave the highest average value for the peak of the correlation function .",
    "this established the optimum set of parameters for the synthetic spectrum template for each star .",
    "the parameters adopted for the final correlations are coded in the final column of table  1 : effective temperature , log  g , [ fe / h ] , and .",
    "table  2 is an illustrative summary of the individual radial velocity measurements , including the heliocentric julian day of mid - exposure , and the velocity and internal error estimate returned by the iraf task * rvsao * , both in kms@xmath20 .",
    "the full table with all the velocity information is available electronically .",
    "we summarize our radial velocity results in table  3 , including the total number of velocities measured for each star , the span of our velocity coverage ( in days ) , the derived rotational velocity , @xmath22 sin  @xmath23 , the mean radial velocity , and the uncertainty of the mean velocity .",
    "note that for the binary stars , the mean radial velocity is not as appropriate as the systemic velocity that emerges from the orbital solution . for stars with orbital solutions , we therefore list here the systemic velocity and its uncertainty .",
    "we include in table  3 the measured rms external error , @xmath24 , and the mean internal error , @xmath25 , of the velocity measurements ( see kurtz & mink 1998 ) , and the ratio , @xmath26 .",
    "large values of @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and above ) are suggestive of radial - velocity variability .",
    "we also employ the probability , p(@xmath28 ) , that the @xmath28 value could be larger than observed due to gaussian errors for a star that actually has constant velocity .",
    "we employ the internal error estimate , @xmath29 , obtained from * rvsao * , for each of @xmath30 exposures when calculating @xmath31 : @xmath32 it is clear that at least four of our five new program stars display radial velocity variability .",

    "the four stars in our earlier work ( cllgm ) that appeared to have constant radial velocities have rather small p(@xmath28 ) values , in particular for bd+25  1981 .",

    "this might indicate two different types of mass transfer and orbital evolution , despite the similarity of the orbital periods .",

    "is this star distinguishable in any way from the three constant velocity , normal - lithium stars ?",
    "if our photometric temperature estimate is correct , the star is slightly hotter than the other single stars , and so might be in the metal - poor equivalent to the hyades lithium gap .",

    "ryan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) suggested that the likely origin of the rotation was the mass transfer process itself , and discussed the mechanisms by which such a process would lead to lithium depletion .",

    "( 1993 ) found that surface lithium depletion in post - main sequence metal - poor stars begins before the stars reach the base of the red giant branch , so mass transfer from a more highly evolved red giant would deposit lithium - depleted material on the recipient main sequence star .",

    "0.3% for the more metal - rich stars ) .",
    "note that we do not believe these results imply that metal - poor dwarfs rotate somewhat faster than metal - rich dwarfs .",
    "the differences may be artificial in the sense that the synthetic spectrum templates may introduce metallicity - dependent differences in the derived rotational velocities .    in figure  8",
    "we show the rotational velocities we have derived ( open and filled circles ) for the stars of table  3 , plus values from ps2000 ( open and filled squares ) . while the observations of ps2000 were obtained using a system with velocity resolution comparable to ours , they derived  values using a different method than have we , which is why we distinguish the two sets of results graphically .",
    "the key question is whether mass transfer is a major cause of the blue straggler phenomenon and whether evidence for it exists in higher rotational velocities for the binary systems . because tidal interactions will spin up short - period binary systems , independent of mass transfer , we have excluded binary systems with orbital periods of less than 20 days from the figure or from further consideration here .",
    "we consider the results from ps2000 first .",
    "there are 14 stars in their study that appear to have constant velocity and have [ fe / h ] @xmath42  @xmath58 .",
    "recall that they have interpreted ( correctly , we believe ) these stars to be bona fide young metal - poor main sequence stars .",

    "our own studies and the results of ps2000 show that blue straggler candidates which are binaries show significantly enhanced surface rotation compared to constant velocity stars . because the orbital periods imply separations far too great for tidal interactions to",
    "_ currently _ have any significant effects on the stars rotational periods , we believe the enhanced rotation indicates mass transfer has occurred and is the cause of the spin - up .",
    "the mass transfer model predicts that the originally more massive star transfers mass to the lower mass secondary , diminishing the orbital period and separation , until the original secondary star becomes the more massive component . at that point ,",
    "the stars begin the separate , but mass transfer has transformed orbital angular momentum into rotational angular momentum , and tidal interactions or some mechanism has reduced the orbital eccentricities .",
    "as noted above , luck & bond ( 1991 ) suggested that some blue stragglers may be progenitors of the subgiant ch stars . until recently ,",
    "there has been little information regarding abundances of carbon and @xmath7-process abundances in blue stragglers that would indicate mass transfer from an agb star , but such data are now beginning to appear , and so we have summarized in table  1 the abundances of the @xmath7-process elements strontium and barium .",
    "the available data for most candidate blue straggler stars are consistent with the normal abundances of these elements in metal - poor main sequence and red giant branch stars ( see mcwilliam 1997 ) .",
    "recently , spc2003 have found strong enhancements of these elements in three of the blue metal - poor stars discussed previously by ps2000 .",
    "thus for these stars the evidence favors mass transfer from an evolving agb star , supporting the hypothesis of luck & bond ( 1991 ) .",
    "if mass transfer from a highly - evolved agb star is responsible for the @xmath7-process enhancements , whereas the stars without such enhancements experienced mass transfer from a normal red giant , we might expect to see some differences in the orbital properties of the two samples .",
    "mass transfer from an agb star could imply , for example , that mass transfer did not occur during the preceding red giant evolutionary phase , and , therefore , the original orbital periods of binary systems destined to experience mass transfer from an agb star should be longer than those which undergo mass transfer from a first ascent red giant .",
    "one might expect , then , that blue stragglers showing signs of agb mass transfer ( @xmath7-process enhancements ) should have longer minimum orbital periods than those that ( presumably ) arose from mass transfer from a red giant ( no such enhancements ) .",
    "qualitatively , table  1 confirms this view . excluding cs  @xmath62 , the eight stars with normal strontium and barium abundances have orbital periods as low as 167 days , and none exceed 500 days .",
    "the six subgiant ch stars with orbital solutions obtained by mcclure ( 1997 ) have periods only as short as 878 days , and extend up to 4140 days .",
    "the eight ( giant ) ch stars studied by mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) have orbital periods ranging from 328 and 2954 days , roughly consistent with this simple picture .",
    "cs  @xmath62 is consistent with this trend , with an orbital period of 1307 days ( spc2003 ) .",
    "its orbital eccentricity is also on the high side ( 0.21 ) for the ensemble of field halo blue stragglers , as figure  4 shows .",
    "however , the other two stars with @xmath7-process enhancements , cs  @xmath8 and cs  @xmath9 , show rather short periods , according to spc2003 , with 342 days ( and e @xmath63 ) and 194 days ( and e @xmath64 ) , respectively . we have not included these stars in table  1 because our orbital solutions using the data available to spc2003 indicated that alternative periods and eccentricities were possible , although less likely .",
    "preston ( private communication ) has continued to observe these stars and these orbital periods are increasingly robust .",
    "in particular , we have been able to confirm to our own satisfaction the orbital period for cs  @xmath8 has cost the first author payment of a wager with dr .",
    "preston that longer periods would be preferred . ] .",
    "additional velocity data are needed , however , for cs  @xmath9 .",
    "we are therefore confronted with the results that mass transfer from red giant and agb stars yield similar ranges in orbital periods and eccentricities .",
    "we can only speculate that diversity in the masses of the original primary stars and their original orbital periods contribute to this splendid if confusing variety .",
    "a point stressed by mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) and mcclure ( 1997 ) was that the mass functions of the ch and subgiant ch stars , respectively , were small and indicative of a uniform secondary mass , roughly that of a white dwarf with 0.6@xmath0 .",
    "we undertook a similar analysis in our previous paper , which we revisit here .",
    "we begin by comparing the distribution of the mass functions of the blue stragglers and the somewhat lower masses of the primary stars in the single - lined spectroscopic binaries of latham et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for stars with orbital periods longer than 20 days .",
    "the mass function for a spectroscopic binary is defined to be @xmath65 where the numerical value of @xmath66 is derived from the parameters of the orbital solution .",
    "figure  9 shows that the two mass function distributions are quite different , with the steeper one for the blue stragglers indicative of a narrower range of secondary masses , as in the cases of the ch and subgiant ch stars .",
    "so what is that secondary mass ? we must begin with an estimate of the masses of the primary stars , then exploit the mass functions to get some idea of the secondary masses of the ensemble . as we have noted , the lack of a detectable secondary spectrum in any of the blue straggler binary systems is suggestive of underluminous secondaries , and we explore here the idea that all the secondaries are stellar remnants with similar masses .    in cllgm , we estimated the mass of each primary star using the derived effective temperatures and chemical compositions , plus the isochrones of girardi et al.(2000 ) .",
    "the isochrone ages were relatively young , generally 1.7 to 2.0 gyrs , to accomodate the high temperatures and apparent high masses of the primaries .",
    "the isochrones were computed using elemental abundances consistent with solar values and , to allow for enhanced abundances of the  @xmath15 \" elements ( [ @xmath15/fe ]  @xmath67 ) , we employed the scaling relation of salaris , chieffi , & straniero ( 1993 ) to calculate @xmath68 for each primary . here",
    "we exploit the ",
    "yonsei - yale \" ( y@xmath14 ) isochrones of yi , kim , & demarque ( 2003 ) , which were computed using @xmath15-enhanced abundances and somewhat more appropriate ( and variable ) helium mass fractions .",
    "we used isochrones with an age of 2.0 gyrs in all cases .",
    "table  5 shows the results .",
    "we have also compared these new primary mass estimates with those computed using the girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) isochrones .",
    "the maximum difference in derived primary mass was 0.04 @xmath0 , and the mean difference , in the sense of y@xmath14 minus girardi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , was @xmath69 @xmath0 , with @xmath70 @xmath0 .",
    "[ tab5 ]    from the estimated value of @xmath71 , we can estimate the mass of the undetected companion ; i.e.  for @xmath72 , using a revised version of equation [ eq : massfunction ] : @xmath73 these are also provided in table  5 .",
    "all of the minimum masses lie below the expected mass of a metal - poor white dwarf , @xmath74@xmath0 .",
    "they also lie far below those expected for a metal - poor main sequence turn - off star ( @xmath75@xmath0 ) or that of a neutron star ( @xmath76@xmath0 ) .",
    "the mean difference in secondary masses derived using the two sets of isochrones is only @xmath77 @xmath0 , with @xmath78 @xmath0 .",
    "if all the secondaries have roughly the same mass , is it closer to that of a white dwarf or a neutron star ?",
    "if we _ assume _ that all the secondaries have the same mass of @xmath79 , and calculate the orbital inclinations that this would imply , we obtain the @xmath80 values listed in table  5 .",
    "the average @xmath80 for the 17 stars in table  5 is @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) , which is not far from the value of @xmath83 expected for randomly oriented orbits .",
    "( use of the isochrones of girardi et al .",
    "2000 leads to an identical result . ) increasing the assumed secondary mass to 0.65 @xmath0 , results in @xmath84 ( @xmath85 ) , which is inconsistent with the expectation by a significant amount , although we must recognize that our results suffer some observational bias in that very low values of sin  @xmath23 result in smaller observed radial velocity variations and such systems are more likely to elude detection . if we further assume the secondaries are all neutron stars , with @xmath86@xmath0 , we find @xmath87 ( @xmath88 ) , and we rule out that class of secondaries , at least in the general case .",
    "we conclude that our orbital solutions are consistent with all the unseen companions in our low - eccentricity long - period orbits being white dwarfs viewed at random orbital orientations , which supports the mass - transfer model for the formation of field blue stragglers . if all the secondaries are white dwarfs with the same mass , then that mass can not be much smaller than @xmath89 , because the three largest minimum masses are @xmath90 ( cs  @xmath62 ) , @xmath91 ( cs  @xmath61 ) , and @xmath92 ( g202 - 65 ) , where the quoted errors include only the contribution from the mass functions and not from possible systematic errors in our estimates of the primary masses . on the other hand",
    ", the secondary masses can not be larger than about @xmath93 , because then the average value for the orbital inclinations would become seriously inconsistent with random orientations of the orbits .",
    "ryan et al .",
    "( 2002 ) have discussed the mechanism for the mass transfer that might have increased the rotational velocities of the stars we see now as blue stragglers .",
    "one of the questions they raised was whether the mass transfer mechanism could have involved stable roche lobe overflow or whether the mass transfer process was unstable .",
    "sudden mass loss via a supernova , for example , would be such an unstable process , although we have essentially ruled out neutron star companions among this sample of field blue stragglers .",
    "rappaport et al .  ( 1995 ) modelled the results of roche lobe overflow .",
    "they considered the evolution of binaries undergoing stable mass transfer , but for the case where the recipient is a neutron star .",
    "the same physics should also apply to systems where the recipient is a main - sequence star .",
    "the essence of the model is that short - period systems are so close that mass transfer begins early , when the expanding red giant core has not yet grown to a  mature \" size .",
    "therefore , the resultant white dwarf will appear with a small ,  premature \" mass . in figure  10 , we plot the minimum white dwarf mass as a function of the orbital period and eccentricity , log  [ @xmath94 .",
    "we also show the model predictions of rappaport et al .",
    "( 1995 ) using their coefficient @xmath95 to be 3300  @xmath96 , consistent with the population  ii case that they discussed .",
    "if all the secondary stars were white dwarfs and had evolved via stable mass transfer , their minimum masses , plotted in figure  10 , should all lie to the left of the theoretical curve , and we find that the data do so , more or less , except for g202 - 65 .",
    "thus almost all of the blue stragglers in table  5 , with orbital periods longer than 20 days , have orbital periods and eccentricities consistent with stable mass transfer .",
    "this includes cs  @xmath62 , the star that shows signs of @xmath7-process enhancements and an implied agb donor star .",
    "we show in figure  10 the locations of the other two such stars from sp2003 , cs  @xmath8 and cs  @xmath9 .",
    "all three stars lie well within the regime of stable mass transfer .",
    "our new search for radial velocity variability of five metal - poor and lithium - deficient field stars has shown that four of them are single - lined spectroscopic binaries with orbital periods of a few hundred days and small orbital eccentricities . combining these results with those of ps2000 and cllgm , we have found that field metal - poor dwarfs hotter than comparable metallicity globular cluster turn - offs may represent stars with two very different origins .",
    "many of the binary stars studied by ps2000 and most , if not all , of the binary stars studied by cllgm and in this paper are distinguished from normal binary stars by their unusually low lithium abundances and unusually low binary orbital eccentricites .",
    "we have shown that the secondaries appear to have a unusually narrow range of masses , and are consistent with white dwarfs of 0.55 @xmath0 . despite the long periods of these binary systems",
    ", we find that their  values are , on average , higher than those of single stars with comparable temperatures , suggesting spin - up as part of a mass transfer event .",
    "using the models of rappaport et al .",

    ", spc2003 found enhanced values of @xmath7-process abundances , signifying mass transfer from an evolved agb star , but not all blue stragglers show such enhancements .",
    "we have not discovered any correlation between the presence or lack of such enhancements and the binary system orbital properties .",
    "another interesting result is that among the constant velocity stars , lithium abundances are normal , including one star , bd+72  94 , that appears to be in the  lithium gap \" .",
    "hd  142575 , on the other hand , may lie in the metal - poor equivalent lithium gap , which may occur at somewhat higher temperatures than is seen in the hyades .",
    "more lithium abundance determinations for constant velocity stars in this temperature regime would be very interesting , both to strengthen the use of lithium as a distinguishing feature of blue stragglers created by mass transfer , and as a tool for exploring the cause of the lithium gap as well .",
