    "existence of a non - zero neutrino magnetic moment has long been a concern of great interest , since it can have an observable laboratory effect such as neutrino - charge lepton elastic scattering , @xmath4 , and also some important astrophysics effect , such as cooling of sn 1987a , cooling of helium stars , etc .",
    "it is likely that neutrinos may have a small but nonvanishing mass ; for various bounds on magnetic moments and masses , see @xcite and @xcite . within the framework of the standard model ,",
    "a nonzero neutrino mass usually imply a nonzero magnetic moment .",
    "it has been shown that @xcite , for a massive neutrino , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the bohr magneton .    in models beyond the standard model , right - handed neutrinos",
    "are often included in interactions ( for a review e.g. @xcite ) , so that we need not depend on a nonzero neutrino mass to generate a nonzero magnetic moment . in this article",
    ", we consider the possibility of using leptoquark interactions to generate a nonzero neutrino magnetic moment . in many unification models , such as su(5 ) , s0(10 ) , etc .",
    ", one often put quarks and leptons into the same multiplet , so that leptoquarks arise naturally for connecting different components within the same multiplet .",
    "what makes a leptoquark unique and interesting is that it couples simultaneously to both a lepton and a quark .",
    "this may help generating a nonzero neutrino magnetic interaction .",
    "specifically , when a top quark involves in the loop diagram , its mass provide a large enhancement for the neutrino magnetic moment .",
    "( in such diagram , a massless neutrino needs some massive internal fermion to flip its chirality , giving rise to some nonzero magnetic moment . )",
    "we add right - handed neutrinos in the general renormalizable lagrangian of leptoquarks .",
    "owing to existence of lepton numbers which recognize the generation , we distinguish leptoquarks by its generation quantum number , but this may induce four - fermion interactions which may enhance some helicity suppressed process such as @xmath7 to the extent that leptonic universality may even be violated .",
    "this usually gives a tight constraint on the leptoquark @xcite .",
    "for non - chiral vector leptoquarks of electromagnetic strength coupling , this corresponds to having a mass heavier than 50 tev for the first generation leptoquark .",
    "with such a heavy leptoquark , we still find a nonzero neutrino magnetic moment @xmath8 up to @xmath9 .",
    "for the second and third generation leptoquarks , their masses are not severely constrained by the above process .",
    "assuming their mass lying somewhere between @xmath1 tev , we obtain @xmath8 of order @xmath2 ( from the second generation leptoquark ) and @xmath3 ( from the third generation leptoquark ) , respectively .",
    "such predictions may already have some observable effects such as those mentioned earlier .",
    "leptoquarks arise naturally in many unification models which attempt to put quarks and leptons in the same multiplet . there are scalar and vector leptoquarks which may couple to left- and right - handed neutrinos at the same time , but only vector leptoquarks can couple to the upper component of the quark su(2 ) doublet .",
    "the heaviness of the top quark may enhance the neutrino magnetic moment once we use the vector leptoquark to connect to the quark doublet .",
    "of course , there are subtleties regarding renormalization of the vector leptoquark which may be treated in a way similar to gauge bosons . in our calculation",
    ", we adopt feynman rules in the @xmath10-gauge and take @xmath11 at the end of the calculation while neglecting all unphysical particles in the @xmath12-gauge .",
    "( this is a step which has often been employed in nonabelian gauge theories . )",
    "we begin our analysis by constructing a general renormalizable lagrangian for the quark - lepton - leptoquark coupling .",
    "following @xcite , we demand such action to be an su(3)@xmath13su(2)@xmath13u(1 ) invariant which conserves the baryon and lepton numbers but , in addition to @xcite we add terms which couple to right - handed neutrinos . for leptoquarks with the fermion number @xmath14 ,    @xmath15    and , for @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    "the notation adopted above is self explanatory ; for example , @xmath18 denotes scalar and vector leptoquarks respectively , the superscript is its average electric charge or the hypercharge @xmath19 , and the subscript of a leptoquark denotes which su(2 ) multiplet it is in , and the generation index is suppressed .",
    "from here it is clear that among those leptoquarks that couple to neutrinos of both chiralities , a radiative @xmath20 diagram with the exchange of a virtual @xmath21-type quark can proceed only when accompanied by a vector leptoquark , namely @xmath22 in @xmath23 or @xmath24 in @xmath25 ; on the other hand , the exchange of a virtual @xmath26-type quark can proceed only with the scalar leptoquark , namely @xmath27 in @xmath23 or @xmath28 in @xmath25 .",
    "note that we do not consider mixing between different leptoquarks due to higgs interactions , which will introduce additional parameters .",
    "the diagram in question is shown explicitly in fig",
    "given these couplings , it is straightforward to calculate induced neutrino magnetic moments via one loop diagrams . to see that the heavy top quark mass can enhance the prediction",
    ", we calculate the @xmath20 diagram with the exchange of up - type quark and @xmath22 i.e. the first term in @xmath23 . as one of the standard methods to treat loop diagrams involving massive vecter particles , we use feynman rules in the @xmath12-gauge and take @xmath29 at the end of calculation while neglecting any unphysicical particle .",
    "in addition to minimum substitution , we add the term @xmath30 in the lagrangian , such that the whole @xmath31 coupling is in a form similar to the non - abelian @xmath32 type coupling , and the procedure results in a finite limit under @xmath33 .",
    "we obtain , with all couplings chosen to be real ,    @xmath34    where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 , while @xmath38 and @xmath39 are given by @xmath40 note that one obtains the desirable chiral structure for the magnetic moment interaction by two different ways : the first is to have an odd number of mass insertions of the quark mass term , giving rise to the first term in @xmath41 ; the other way is by the neutrino mass term , resulting in the second term of @xmath41 .",
    "there are two advantages with the first scenario .",
    "first of all , one can obtain a nonzero magnetic moment without restricted by the very light neutrino mass .",
    "second , one may have a prediction enhanced considerably by the heavy top quark mass .",
    "before working out numerical predictions , we need to consider the constrains arising from the leptonic decays of the pseudoscalar meson , such as @xmath42@xcite . intergrating out @xmath43 and performing fierz reordering , we obtain @xmath44 relevant to the leptonic decay of a pseudoscalar meson , @xmath45 we consider the universality constraint arising from the @xmath0 leptonic decay , and neglect the neutrino mass contribution .",
    "define @xmath46 .",
    "the first and third terms of @xmath44 have interference with the standard model fermi interaction .",
    "this is an order of @xmath47 correction to @xmath48 , while the other term is a correction of order @xmath49 .",
    "furthermore , the first term which is scalar coupling is enhanced by a factor of @xmath50 so this is the dominent term to constrain the mass of the leptoquark .",
    "we assume @xmath51 which is a natural assumption for the vecter leptoquark .",
    "we obtain @xmath52 where experimental average @xmath53@xcite , and standard model calculation @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "this correspond to @xmath55 for a coupling of the electromagnetic strength , this correspond to having the vector leptoquark with a mass greater than 50 tev for the first generation .",
    "this constraint is in fact more servere than what we may obtain from the atomic parity vialation experiment , which we shall ignore in this paper . for the second and third generations",
    "leptoquarks , there is no direct restriction from the universality of the @xmath56 leptonic decay , nor from the atomic parity violation experiment .",
    "nevertheless , one can find various lower bounds for the leptoquark mass @xcite , from direct searches at the hera @xmath57 collider , the tevatron @xmath58 collider , and at the lep @xmath59 collider .",
    "typical bounds from direct searches is about few hundreds gev , while the bounds form indirect searches are given in @xcite .",
    "we shall consider a leptoquark mass in the general range of tev s .",
    "for the reason of comparisons , let us recall briefly some of the upper limit obtained from the leptonic scattering such as elastic @xmath60(@xmath61 ) with @xmath62(@xmath63 ) , @xmath64 , etc .",
    ", and also from the astrophysical processes such as cooling of helium stars , red giant luminosity and so on @xcite .",
    "as a reference point , we recall the standard model formula on the neutrino magnetic moment arising from a nonzero neutrino mass@xcite , @xmath65 ( referred to as `` the extended standard electroweak theory '' ) .",
    "accordingly , the upper limit of @xmath8 for the first generation neutrino is @xmath66 with @xmath67 ev . the upper limit may also be obtained from leptonic scatterings , which is typically @xmath68 , or from astrophysics studies with a more stringent upper limit of @xmath69 .",
    "our numerical results for the first generation are summarized in fig .",
    "2 , where the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath70 in units of @xmath6 is shown as a function of the leptoquark mass . we note that , for the leptoquark mass @xmath71 $ ] of 50 to 100 tev , @xmath70 is of order @xmath72 , a value compatible with the extended standard electroweak theory .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath8 for the second generation neutrino is @xmath73 ( with @xmath74 mev ) in the extended standard electroweak theory @xcite , or in the range of @xmath68 from leptonic scatterings , while from astrophysics the typical value is @xmath69 . in fig .",
    "3 , we describe our prediction on the neutrino magnetic moment @xmath70 in units of @xmath6 as a function of the leptoquark mass of 1 to 100 tev .",
    "we obtain @xmath70 around @xmath75 , a value very close to being observable .",
    "the upper limit of @xmath8 for the third generation neutrino is @xmath76 ( with @xmath77 mev ) in the extended standard electroweak theory @xcite , or in the range of @xmath78 from leptonic scatterings , while from astrophysics studies the upper limit is @xmath79 . in fig .",
    "4 , we plot the third generation neutrino magnetic moment @xmath70 in units @xmath6 as a function of the leptoquark mass in the range of 1 to 100 tev . we find that @xmath70 is of order @xmath80 .",
    "vector leptoquarks in the tev mass range , when couple to both left- and right - handed neutrinos , offer an alternative mechanism for generating a nonvanishing neutrino magnetic moment , which in some cases is by no means negligible .",
    "this alternative mechanism ( which does not require a nonzero neutrino mass ) makes use of the special feature that leptoquarks couple simultaneously to leptons and quarks . for the third generation neutrino",
    ", there is a potential enhancement from the very large top quark mass making the corresponding predicted neutrino magnetic moments fairly sizable .",
