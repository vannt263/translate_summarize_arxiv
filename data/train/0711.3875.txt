    "there is growing interest in hopf algebras defined from trees , permutations , and other combinatorial structures . in this paper , we provide an expository account of some of the hopf algebras that can be defined using trees , labeled trees , ordered trees and heap ordered trees .",
    "we also describe some actions of these hopf algebras on algebra of functions .",
    "we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic definitions and properties of hopf algebras , as covered , for example , in @xcite .",
    "this paper is based in part on @xcite .",
    "throughout this paper , @xmath0 will be a field of characteristic  @xmath1 such as the real numbers or the complex numbers .    by a _ tree _",
    "we will mean a finite rooted tree .",
    "let @xmath2 be the set of finite rooted trees , and let @xmath3 be the @xmath0-vector space that has @xmath2 as a basis .",
    "in this section , we define an algebraic structure on @xmath3 that was introduced in @xcite .",
    "suppose that @xmath4 , @xmath5 are trees .",
    "let @xmath6 ,  , @xmath7 be the children of the root of @xmath4 and let @xmath8 denote the operator that operates on a tree and removes the root to produce a forest of trees : @xmath9    if @xmath10 has @xmath11 nodes ( counting the root ) , there are @xmath12 ways to attach the @xmath13 subtrees of @xmath4 that have @xmath6 ,  , @xmath7 as roots to the tree @xmath10 . to do this",
    ", make each @xmath14 the child of some node of @xmath10 .",
    "we let @xmath15 denote this operation that attaches a forest of trees @xmath6 , @xmath16 , @xmath7 to the nodes of a tree @xmath10 in all possible ways to produce a set of trees .",
    "the product @xmath17 of the trees @xmath4 and @xmath10 is defined to be the sum of these @xmath12 trees .",
    "we summarize this in the following definition :    the product of the trees @xmath18 and @xmath5 is defined to be @xmath19    here we sum over the elements of the sets @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "it is immediate that this definition can be extended by linearity from @xmath2 to the vector space @xmath3 , and that the trivial tree consisting only of the root is a right and left unit for this product . for a proof that this operation is associative , see @xcite .",
    "here are some simple examples of tree multiplication :    @xmath22      we now define a coalgebra structure on the vector space @xmath3 : @xmath23 here , if @xmath24 are multisets , @xmath25 denotes the set theoretic difference .",
    "it is easily checked that the definition of a coproduct is satisfied , so that @xmath3 is a cocommutative coalgebra .",
    "this coalgebra and the algebra given in example  [ shuffle - eg ] , with @xmath26 being the set of trees whose root has exactly one child , are duals of each other as graded vector spaces , with a tree with @xmath11 nodes being of degree @xmath27 , and the degree of a monomial @xmath28 being the sum of the degrees of @xmath29 ,  , @xmath30 . the fact that coassociativity for this coalgebra is trivial gives an easy proof of the associativity of the algebra in example  [ shuffle - eg ] .",
    "another algebra of trees was described in @xcite in 1998 that is defined as follows :    if @xmath31 is the set of rooted trees , form expressions @xmath32 , where @xmath33 .",
    "this is clearly a commutative algebra of monomials , which we denote @xmath34 .",
    "the coalgebra structure of @xmath34 is defined as follows : we introduce the notion of _ cut_. a cut is a set of removed edges . given a tree @xmath35 , an _",
    "admissable cut _ of @xmath35 is one with at most one removed edge on each path from the root to any leaf . for a cut @xmath36",
    "we let @xmath37 to be the resulting piece containing the root , and @xmath38 to be the monomial consisting of the other pieces .",
    "then define @xmath39 there is an isomorphism @xmath40 from the hopf algebra @xmath3 to the graded dual of @xmath34 satisfying @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 . here @xmath44 is an inner product defined on @xmath34 that depends upon a factor determined by the symmetry of the arguments . for the definition of this inner product and a proof of this fact , see @xcite .",
    "it is easy to extend the definition of multiplication of trees from the vector space whose basis is the set of finite rooted trees to the vector space whose basis is the set of finite _ labeled _ rooted trees : simply label each node except the root with a label and keep the labels attached to the nodes when applying the operators @xmath21 and @xmath20 . as shown in @xcite this",
    "yields a hopf algebra .",
    "similarly , the same definition of the product and coproduct applies to the vector space whose basis is the set of finite _ ordered trees _ , as well as to the vector space",
    "whose basis is the set of finite _ ordered , labeled trees_. both produce hopf algebras .",
    "see @xcite for details .    later in this paper",
    ", we will need the hopf algebra of heap ordered trees , which we define following @xcite :    [ def : hot ] a standard heap ordered tree on @xmath11 nodes is a finite , rooted tree in which all nodes except the root are labeled with the numbers @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , ",

    "let @xmath55 be the vector space over the field @xmath0 whose basis is the set of trees in @xmath54 , and let @xmath56    a heap ordered tree is a rooted tree in which every node ( including the root ) is given a different positive integer label such that condition  [ hot:2 ] .  of definition",
    "[ def : hot ] is satisfied .",

    "heap ordered trees occur naturally when studying permutations and differential operators , as we shall see below .      to summarize , with the product and coproduct as defined above , the vector spaces whose bases are ( i ) the set of rooted trees , ( ii ) labeled rooted trees , ( iii ) ordered trees , ( iv ) labeled ordered trees , ( v ) heap ordered trees , and ( vi ) labeled heap ordered trees are all hopf algebras ( see  @xcite ) .    in section  [ section : hot ] , we show that there is an isomorphism from the hopf algebra of heap ordered trees to a hopf algebra on permutations . in section  [ section : psi1 ] ,",
