    "in the past decade , sensitive mid - infrared ( ir ) observations with the _",
    "spitzer space telescope _ and _ wide - field infrared explorer _ ( wise ) have forever changed our understanding of bh growth by unveiling , at last , large populations of obscured quasars .",
    "many luminous type 2 active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have been identified from narrow optical emission lines ( @xcite ) , radio luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or x - ray properties ( e.g , @xcite ) , but the most efficient techniques for finding obscured quasars employ mid - ir photometry . pioneering work with _ spitzer",
    "_ showed that obscured quasars have similar mid - ir seds to their unobscured counterparts , but are dominated by host galaxy light in the optical ( @xcite , hereafter h07 ) . in the mid - ir ,",
    "obscured quasars can be reliably selected using simple color criteria , in particular being very red in [ 3.6][4.5 ] ( characteristic of a `` hot '' mid - ir sed ) and very red in @xmath9 $ ] , indicating a faint optical counterpart ( fig.1 ) .",
    "mid - ir studies find roughly equal numbers of obscured and unobscured quasars ( e.g. , )",
    ".    obscured quasars therefore represent a large fraction of the massive bh growth in the universe , but their precise nature remains a mystery .",
    "in particular , what is the origin of the obscuring material , and what role do these objects play in the evolution of black holes and galaxies ?",
    "the simple `` unified model '' for agn attributes obscuration to the orientation of a gas- and dust - rich torus intrinsic to the central engine ( e.g. , @xcite ) , but it is not clear whether this model applies to objects with quasar luminosities .",
    "a competing hypothesis is that quasars are fueled by major mergers of galaxies that drive gas and dust clouds to the nucleus , obscuring the central engine , as suggested in models of bh - galaxy co - evolution ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one clue about the nature of the obscuring material is the connection between obscuration by _ dust _ which is manifested through extinction of rest - frame ultraviolet and optical nuclear light , and absorption by neutral _",
    "gas _ which is detectable by its effect on the observed x - ray spectrum . in the simplest unified scenarios ,",
    "neutral gas and dust are co - spatial and so both types of obscuration should be observed in the same systems .",
    "this is in fact what is observed in most obscured agns , however @xmath1030% of moderate - luminosity agns show a mismatch between optical and x - ray classification criteria ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , suggesting some deviation from the simplest unified scenario .",
    "( calculated as @xmath11 in the observed frame ) for ir - selected quasars .",
    "the selection boundary of @xmath12 ( corresponding to @xmath9 = 6.1 $ ] in vega magnitudes ) is shown as a dashed line with irqso-1s and irqso-2s residing above and below the line , respectively .",
    "contours are derived from ir source density .",
    "the filled blue stars ( xqso-1 ) , purple squares ( xqso-1.5 ) , and red circles ( xqso-2 ) are the x - ray classifications for our x - ray spectroscopic sample , discussed in  3.[fig:1 ] ]    obscuration is particularly interesting for powerful quasars ( given the expected importance of merger fueling ) but the obscuration properties of luminous agn have been less well studied due to their relative rarity .",
    "furthermore , it is also interesting to study the obscuration in luminous quasars given the reported decreasing trend of obscured agn at increasing luminosities ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". a recent study of x - ray selected agns in the cosmos field @xcite found that at quasar luminosities ( @xmath13 erg s@xmath14 ) @xmath1080% of agns have classifications for dust and gas obscuration that agree , with the majority of the `` mismatch '' corresponding to optically - unobscured but gas - obscured sources . previous studies of such objects have suggested they are preferentially hosted by more rapidly star - forming galaxies , indicating that the x - ray absorbing gas arises from galaxy - scale structures that are far larger than the putative torus , and may be associated with an outflowing wind @xcite .",
    "however , @xcite found that x - ray obscured , optically - unobscured quasars have spectra and photometric properties that are identical to their x - ray unobscured counterparts , suggesting that the absorption may instead be due to small - scale clouds within the putative torus .    in this study , we further explore the connection between gas and dust obscuration in luminous quasars , using observations from the wide - field ( 9 deg@xmath1 ) botes multiwavelength survey area that enable efficient selection of rare , luminous sources .",
    "we analyze x - ray spectra of 33 high - luminosity ir - selected quasars in the xbotes deep survey .",
    "we find a strong correspondence between dust and gas obscuration in luminous quasars , consistent with the predictions of unified models as well as simple evolutionary scenarios in which the gas and dust are co - spatial .",
    "our sample of quasars is drawn from , who selected 1479 luminous agns based on the mid - ir color criteria of @xcite .",
    "the vast majority of these sources have estimates of bolometric luminosity",
    "@xmath15 corresponding to the commonly - used division between `` seyfert galaxies '' and `` quasars '' ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so for the remainder of this paper we refer to the sample objects as quasars .",
    "the mid - ir observations come from the spitzer irac shallow survey @xcite and optical photometry from the noao deep wide field survey @xcite , and is limited to redshifts @xmath16 determined by optical spectroscopy from the agn and galaxy evolution survey ( ages ; @xcite ) or using photometric redshifts from @xcite . found that the full ir - selected quasar sample could be easily divided into dust - obscured and unobscured sources based on their optical to mid - ir color , as they exhibited a bimodal color distribution with a boundary at @xmath9 = 6.1 $ ] ( or equivalently @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the luminosities in the _",
    "observed_-frame @xmath20 and 4.5 micron bands ; see figure  [ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we also include estimates of quasar bolometric luminosity derived from fitting mid - ir spectral energy distributions , as described by @xcite",
    ".    showed that the objects with blue @xmath9 $ ] colors are dominated in the optical by unobscured light from the quasar nucleus , while the nucleus is obscured in the redder sources such that the optical light is dominated by the host galaxy",
    ". also showed via an x - ray stacking analysis that the average x - ray spectra of unobscured quasars were consistent with no absorption by neutral gas , while the obscured quasars had harder average x - ray spectra indicating significant gas absorption with @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "however , given the shallow ( 5 ks ; @xcite ) x - ray observations available in the analysis , this comparison was only possible for _ average _ x - ray hardness ratios and could not explore variations in x - ray spectra between individual sources .",
    "this study expands on that work by analyzing deeper _ chandra _ acis observations ( including from the xbotes deep survey ) of quasars in the sample .",
    "the deeper observations consist of 36 exposures between 2001 and 2012 with an average exposure time of 41.6 ks , of which 13 are with the acis - i array and 13 are with acis - s ( table [ tab:1 ] ) .",
    "the data were reprocessed using the chav ( v.2011.01.25 ) and ciao 4.1.2 ( caldb 4.1.4 ) packages . to obtain sufficient quality x - ray spectra",
    "we limit our analyses to objects with @xmath2150 counts in the 0.2 - 7 kev band .",
    "we match the sources to the 1479 ir - selected quasars from using the topcat @xcite cone - search algorithm with a 10  radius .",
    "a total of 33 quasars were selected , with an average of @xmath23 counts per source .    using the @xmath9 $ ] color criterion ,",
    "24 of the ir - selected quasars in our sample are classified as unobscured ( irqso-1 ) while 9 are obscured ( irqso-2 ) .",
    "our bright x - ray spectroscopic sample contains a low fraction of irqso-2s ( 9/33 or 27% ) that is significantly smaller than the 43% obscured fraction in the full irqso sample from .",
    "this is due to the fact that x - ray qso2s are generally fainter in x - rays ; the fraction of irqsos with x - ray counterparts in original shallow ( 5 ks ) xbotes survey is @xmath2460% for irqso-1s and only @xmath2430% for irqso-2s , while the average x - ray flux of the undetected sources , determined from stacking , is also systematically lower for the irqso-2s .",
    "the fainter x - ray emission from irqso-2s is most likely due to higher levels of gas obscuration that not only hardens the x - ray spectrum but reduces the observed flux ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this fact reflects a correspondence between gas and dust obscuration in these quasars , which we aim to test further by direct measurement of the obscuring column density ( @xmath3 ) in the x - ray spectra of the bright sources for which these measurements are possible .",
    "we extract source and background spectra and produce response functions using standard ciao software .",
    "sources and background spectra were extracted from hand - selected circular regions with mean radii of 11.5 pixels and 100.1 pixels , respectively .",
    "the resulting spectra were fit using sherpa ( 4.1.2 ) with a one - dimensional power law ( xspowerlaw.p1 ) convolved with two neutral hydrogen absorption laws , one for the milky way ( xswabs.abs1 ) , and one for the host galaxy ( xszwabs.abs2 ) absorption .",
    "the milky way absorption column density was frozen at the mean of all 33 quasars , @xmath25 @xmath22 , derived from the chandra x - ray center s colden calculator .",
    "the host galaxy redshifts are fixed at values taken either from ages spectroscopic measurements @xcite or photometric redshifts @xcite , as described in .",
    "the power - law index @xmath26 , normalization , and intrinsic @xmath3 were allowed to vary in the spectral fitting .",
    "examples of the x - ray spectral fits are shown in figure [ fig:2 ] for one source showing no evidence for gas absorption , and another with detectable @xmath3 .",

    "[ fig : gamma_nh ] ]    the primary result of this analysis is the correspondence between the optical / mid - ir and x - ray obscuration criteria . among the 24 dust - unobscured (",

    "we thus obtain a strong , if not perfect , correlation between absorption by gas and dust , with only a few examples showing clearly anomalous gas absorption for the observed optical and mid - ir properties ( broadly consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "the largest @xmath100 observed in our xqso-2 sample is relatively modest ( only a few @xmath101 @xmath22 ) ; it is likely that more heavily obscured sources ( @xmath102 ) are excluded from our x - ray spectroscopic sample because their observed fluxes are too faint to yield the required numbers of counts , as discussed in   2 .",
    "overall , these results indicate that obscuration by gas and dust are strongly correlated in ir - selected luminous quasars .",
    "this correspondence indicates that gas and dust obscuration generally arise in the same structures , consistent with the predictions of the unified model but also with the simplest evolutionary models .",
    "we thus can not draw robust conclusions about whether the obscuring material is in a small - scale torus or due to larger - scale galactic structures .",
    "a recent study of their far - ir properties using 250 @xmath103 m data from _ herschel _ suggests that the irqso-2s have higher average rates of star formation than irqso-1s ( chen et al .",
    "2014 , in prep ) , suggesting that at least some quasars are obscured by galaxy - scale material associated with rapid star formation .",
    "however , only 4 of our 33 objects are detected at 250 @xmath103 m with _ herschel _ and of these two show neither gas nor dust obscuration , while the other two are obscured in both classifications , so it is unclear whether large - scale material is responsible for any of the observed obscuration .",
    "we find that only a small fraction of dust - unobscured quasars show _ clear _ x - ray absorption signatures . of the quasars in our x - ray spectroscopic sample ,",
    "@xmath2417% are irqso-1s with best - fit values of @xmath104 @xmath22 , similar to the fraction of such mismatches found by @xcite .",
    "we note however that all but one of these objects are consistent with having little or no gas absorption , and their distribution in the plane ir and optical luminosity ( figure 1 ) is indistinguishable to irqso-1s with no x - ray absorption .",
    "we therefore caution that the observed incidence of these mismatches must be treated as an upper limit , and that the x - ray absorbed broad - line quasars may in fact be rare in the full quasar population ; an accurate census of quasars with modest obscuration provides strong motivation for future high - throughput x - ray observatories .",
    "overall our results serve to verify that obscured quasar selection based on optical to mid - ir color preferentially identifies systems that show evidence for obscuration at other wavelengths . even in our bright x - ray spectroscopic sample ,",
    "for which the effective flux limit biases us _ against _ heavily x - ray obscured sources as discussed in   2 , we still find that the majority of dust - obscured quasar candidates show clear evidence for x - ray absorption .",
    "this indicates that the full population of dust - obscured quasars likely has a very high incidence of corresponding gas absorption .",
