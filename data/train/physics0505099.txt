    "it is commonly observed that strongly interacting groups of people may show very abrupt and unexpected behavior or opinion changes .",
    "these `` transitions '' may even lead people to behave against their inmost sense of good and evil .",
    "this is seen in many crowd phenomena , less harmfully , in fashion phenomena , or , more dramatically , in the setting off of civil wars often leading to despotic regimes .",
    "of course , these phenomena may have very different reasons , but we propose a very simple model that shows the same features and which may give some insights on the mechanisms of these regime reversals .",
    "our hope is based upon similarities in the manifestations of different non - democratic regimes which suggest that similar universal mechanisms may have played a role .",
    "all those regimes had powerful and merciless mechanisms of repression against people who were either enemies of the regime or merely neutral to it .",
    "however , one could argue that ( see , for example , @xcite ) the stability of those regimes was not based only on repression . in some cases , the honest belief of the majority of the population in the official ideas , or , at least the fact that people behave as if it was the case , could play a major role .",
    "for example , as soon as this faithfulness became weak , the soviet union fell and the security forces were unable to stop this process .",
    "in many cases these ideologies drastically contradict the moral principles of a normal human being .",
    "it is reasonable to think that those principles are shared by a vast majority of human beings .",
    "the experience of the 20th century thus shows that under certain conditions these principles fail and the behavior of people seems to be controlled by some collective phenomena .",
    "once more , we do not pretend that the model we have developed _ explains _ these historical events .",
    "our modest goal is to show its _ analogies _ with human situations and to show how conformity can lead to unexpected extreme and paradoxical situations .    these sociological or historical phenomena are often sudden , turmoil is drastic , and its apparent cause seems insignificant . for a physicist ,",
    "this problem resembles a phase transition in a system consisting of interacting elements . in the system under study these elements are people and",
    "the most important part of their interaction is conformity .",
    "conformity implies the ability , or the propensity , of people to change their opinion under influence of the opinions of surrounding people .",
    "the conformity may be measured quantitatively by a simple experiment of the following type . a few pieces of paper each with its own number",
    "are demonstrated to a group of people .",
    "each piece is either white or black .",
    "after the pieces are removed the experimentalist asks what is the color of piece # 2 .",
    "in fact , only one person in a group is being tested in this experiment ; the rest of the group are also experimentalists , though the tested person is unaware of that .",
    "the tested person is asked the question after all the experimentalist s team presents the same wrong answer one after another .",
    "this experiment shows how difficult is to say that white is white after all other members of a group claimed that the white piece is black .",
    "the majority of people are unable to remain true to their conviction and will give a wrong answer ( when the tested persons are alone , they almost always give the right answer ) .",
    "as far as we know , these studies began in the middle 50th .",
    "nowadays they flourish mostly in the purpose of marketing .",
    "now everybody can take a free test to estimate roughly his / her level of conformity using asch s conformity study @xcite .",
    "the role of conformity in a society has been considered previously @xcite .",
    "we do not wish to imply that conformity itself is something bad .",
    "this is one of human properties which allows social life .",
    "however , we study below how conformity may lead to instabilities in human societies .",
    "statistical physics is widely used for studying opinion dynamics in society in the framework of different models@xcite .",
    "there are good reviews of the field@xcite .",
    "our paper is devoted to a different aspect of the problem , and we use here rather the gibbs ensemble than dynamical equations .",
    "our rough model considers the opinion of the society with respect to only one statement .",
    "we assume that all previous experience of the society including the inherited ideas of good and bad dictates a negative opinion with respect to that statement .",
    "however there is a conformity interaction between overlapping groups of the society and also there are some individuals who , in spite of everything , have a positive opinion with respect to the statement .",
    "their positive opinion is a little bit stronger than the negative opinion of other people . following the terminology of mobilia @xcite we shall call these individuals `` zealots '' . the number of zealots is not fixed and is determined from the thermal equilibrium .",
    "we interpret the phase transition in this system as social instability . at small conformity",
    "the majority has a negative opinion while at high conformity the opinion of the majority becomes strongly positive , i.e. the majority of people become zealots .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model reads :    @xmath0    for simplicity it is formulated on a two - dimensional lattice .",
    "variables @xmath1 may take values @xmath2 or @xmath3 .",
    "they represent the opinion of the person on a site @xmath4 with respect to a given statement . in terms of the previous terminology zealots",
    "have positive opinions and value @xmath5 .",
    "this parameter describes some extra strength of the positive opinion , the negative opinion being the `` normal '' one ( whether because it corresponds to the true color of the piece of paper , or to the opinion dictated by the `` universal '' notion of good and evil  ) . in the absence of conformity ( @xmath6 ) , at low temperatures all the opinions are negative ( within thermal fluctuations ) .",
    "the random values @xmath7 are _ positive _ with a gaussian distribution @xmath8 .",
    "they describe the diversity of the individuals with respect to the statement under consideration . indeed , considering only the first term in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) , one finds that the energy @xmath9 has a minimum when all values of @xmath1 are negative .",
    "the second term describes interaction and conformity .",
    "it has a minimum when all @xmath1 have the same sign , in other words when all people think in the same way .",
    "moreover , at any positive value of @xmath10 , it prefers all people to be zealots . for simplicity",
    "we consider only the interactions with the four nearest neighbors on a square lattice and @xmath11 .",
    "( [ h ] ) can be represented as an hamiltonian of the ising model in some fictitious magnetic field@xcite . introducing the new variables @xmath12",
    "one gets :    @xmath13    where :    @xmath14    is a random `` magnetic field '' at a site @xmath4 , c is is irrelevant constant , and the values of @xmath15 are @xmath16 .",
    "we now show that our system has a first order phase transition . at zero temperature",
    "it can be derived exactly . to find the transition point we compare the energies of the two states . in the state",

    "it is easily found that :    @xmath24    one can see that , at small interaction @xmath25 , the state i has the lower energy while in the opposite case the state ii has the lower energy and represents the ground state of the system .",
