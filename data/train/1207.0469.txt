    "the general concern of this paper is the dynamics of solid bodies in a fluid flow .",
    "this dynamics is relevant to many natural and industrial processes , like blood flows , sprays , or design of micro swimmers .",
    "a main problem to understand this dynamics is to compute the drag exerted by the flow on the bodies . from the mathematical point of view ,",
    "a natural approach to this problem is to use the euler or navier - stokes equations to model the flow .",
    "however , this generates serious difficulties .",
    "a famous one is _",
    "dalembert s paradox _",
    ", related to the euler equation : in an incompressible and inviscid potential flow , a solid body undergoes no drag @xcite .",
    "but the navier - stokes equations also raise modeling issues .",
    "let us consider for instance a single solid moving in a viscous fluid .",
    "we denote by @xmath1 , @xmath2 the solid and fluid domains at time @xmath3 , and @xmath4 the total domain .",
    "we assume that the fluid is governed by the navier - stokes equations .",
    "we denote @xmath5 and @xmath6 its velocity and internal pressure , @xmath7 its density , @xmath8 its viscosity .",
    "thus : @xmath9 with @xmath10 the gravitational force . in parallel to the fluid modeling , we write the conservation of linear and angular momentum for the body . denoting @xmath11 the position of the center of mass , @xmath12 its velocity , and @xmath13 the angular velocity at time @xmath3",
    ", these conservation laws read @xmath14 following standard notations , @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the density and mass of the solid ( independent of @xmath3 and @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 is the newtonian tensor of the fluid : @xmath19 and @xmath20 is the inertia matrix of the solid : @xmath21 the vector @xmath22 is the unit normal vector pointing inside the solid @xmath23 .",
    "note that the velocity @xmath24 at each point @xmath17 of the solid reads @xmath25    to close the system , one usually imposes no - slip conditions , both at the fluid - solid interface and the cavity boundary : @xmath26 and one specifies the initial data : the initial position of the solid @xmath27 , @xmath28    one could believe that system -- is a good model for the interaction between a solid and a viscous fluid . far from it : in the case of a sphere falling over a flat wall @xmath29 it predicts that no collision is possible between the solid and the wall !",
    "this no - collision paradox has been known from specialists since the 1960 s , after articles by cox and brenner and cooley and oneill in the context of stokes equations . since then , the no - collision paradox has been confirmed at the level of the navier - stokes equations ( see @xcite , and the preliminary result in ) .",
    "of course , such a result is unrealistic , as it goes against archimedes principle .",
    "it suggests that the navier - stokes equations are not relevant to collisional and post - collisional descriptions .",
    "hence , many physicists have tried to find an explanation for the paradox .",
    "_ we shall focus here on one possible explanation , namely the no - slip condition_. the idea is that , when the distance between the solids gets very small ( below the micrometer ) , the no - slip condition is no longer accurate , and must be replaced by a navier condition : @xmath30 in other words , only the normal component of the relative velocity of the fluid is zero , to ensure impermeability .",
    "the tangential ones are non - zero , and proportional to the stress constraint , with constant slip lengths @xmath31 . for a recent discussion of the navier condition , notably in the context of microfluidics",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "see also the seminal paper @xcite .",
    "let us point out that the navier - condition is sometimes used as a wall law , to describe the averaged effect of rough hydrophobic surfaces @xcite .",
    "the effect of slip conditions on collision was investigated recently by the authors in article @xcite .",
    "more precisely , this article is devoted to a simplified model , in which    * the navier - stokes equations are replaced by the steady stokes ones ( quasi - static regime ) . *",
    "the domain @xmath32 is a half - space , the solid @xmath33 is a sphere .    in this context , denoting @xmath34 the distance between @xmath23 and the plane @xmath35 , it is shown that the dynamics obeys the reduced ode @xmath36 where the drag term @xmath37 satisfies @xmath38 as @xmath39 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast with the case of no - slip conditions , for which @xmath40 .",
    "in particular , it allows for collisions in finite time .",
    "we refer to @xcite for all details and other results in the context of rough boundaries .",
    "hence , paper @xcite provides a resolution of the paradox : one can _ a priori _ keep the navier - stokes equations , up to considering the navier boundary conditions .",
    "nevertheless , the analysis in @xcite is limited to simple configurations and to stokes flows . in the context of the full 3d navier - stokes system",
    ", more complicated behaviors may occur .",
    "for instance , smooth solutions may exhibit singularities prior to any collision . to describe the qualitative features of the collision ,",
    "_ one needs to consider weak solutions_. the theory of weak solutions is well understood in the case of no - slip conditions and many references will be given in the next section .",
    "_ however , the existence of weak solutions with navier conditions has been so far an open question , due to serious additional mathematical difficulties . to address",
    "this question is the purpose of the present paper_. broadly , we shall build weak solutions for system -- , up to collision between the solid and the cavity @xmath32 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ results ] contains the statement of our main result : we give a definition of weak solutions , and state the existence of such solutions as long as no contact occurs .",
    "we explain the main difficulties in proving their existence , in comparison to the results available for no - slip conditions .",
    "we conclude section [ results ] by an outline of our proof , to be carried out in sections [ transport ] to [ convergence ] .",
    "more precisely :    * section [ transport ] is devoted to an auxiliary nonlinear transport equation , which is crucial to our approximation procedure .",
    "* section [ approx ] is dedicated to the construction of solutions for well - chosen approximations of the navier - stokes / solid dynamics .",
    "* section [ convergence ] describes the limit procedure , from the approximate to the exact system .",
    "the aim of this paragraph is to define a weak formulation and weak solutions for system -- , that is in the case of slip conditions of navier type .",
    "we remind that in the case of no - slip conditions , the theory of weak solutions has been successfully achieved over the last ten years , first up to collision ( see ) and then globally in time ( see in the 2d case , @xcite in the 3d case ) .",
    "let us also mention the alternative approach in @xcite , and the recent result @xcite on the uniqueness of 2d weak solutions up to collision .    as usual",
    ", in order to derive a weak formulation , the starting point is formal multiplication by appropriate test functions .",
    "these test functions must of course look like the solution itself .",
    "notably , they must be rigid vector fields in the solid domain @xmath33 .",
    "this forces the space of test functions to depend on the solution itself : it is a classical difficulty , already recognized in the no - slip case .",
    "_ a key feature of the slip conditions is that these test functions , and also the solution , will be moreover discontinuous across the fluid / solid interface .",
    "_ indeed , the first line of ensures the continuity of the normal component , but the tangential ones may have a jump .",
    "it is a strong difference with regards to boundary conditions , and it will generate many difficulties throughout the paper .",
    "we first introduce some notation for the classical spaces of solenoidal vector fields .",
    "let @xmath41 be a lipschitz domain .",
    "we set @xmath42 we remind that elements @xmath43 of @xmath44 satisfy @xmath45 in @xmath46 .",
    "we also introduce the finite dimensional space of rigid vector fields in @xmath47 : @xmath48 finally , we define for any @xmath49 the space @xmath50 of test functions over @xmath51 : @xmath52 ; l^2_\\sigma(\\omega ) ) , \\ : \\mbox{there exists }  \\ : \\varphi_f \\in { \\cal d}([0,t ) ;   { \\cal d}_\\sigma(\\overline{\\omega } ) ) , \\ :   \\varphi_s \\in { \\cal d}([0,t ) ;   { \\cal r } )   \\\\   \\mbox {  such that } \\ :   \\varphi(t,\\cdot ) = \\varphi_f(t,\\cdot ) \\ :   \\mbox {  on } f(t ) , \\ :",

    "let us also notice that the constraint @xmath54 encodes in a weak form the continuity of the normal component at @xmath55 : @xmath56    multiplying by @xmath57 , integrating over @xmath53 , and integrating by parts , we obtain ( formally ) @xmath58 where the normal vectors @xmath59 , in the integrals at the right - hand side , point resp .",
    "outside @xmath32 and inside @xmath23 .",

    "setting @xmath65 in the above formal computations yields that , for all @xmath66 : $ ] @xmath67 this goes together with the conservation of mass , that amounts to the transport of @xmath33 by the rigid vector field @xmath68 .",
    "it reads @xmath69 or in a weak form : for all @xmath70 , @xmath71    pondering on these formal manipulations , we can now introduce our definition of a weak solution on @xmath51 .",

    "the integrals over @xmath23 in are integrable with respect to time : namely , @xmath89 belong to @xmath90 .",

    "it follows that all integrals in equation make sense .",
    "for instance , as @xmath55 is lipschitz for all @xmath3 and fields @xmath94 have at least @xmath95 regularity , the surface integral @xmath96 can be defined for almost every @xmath3 in the trace sense .",
    "moreover , it defines an element of @xmath90 .",
    "this can be seen through the change of variable @xmath97 : the surface integral turns into @xmath98 where @xmath99 and where @xmath100^{-1 } \\ , \\nu(y ) \\|_2",

    "the condition @xmath107 implies that @xmath108 all terms being again understood in the trace sense .",
    "it is easy to see that equation , that is the transport equation @xmath109 can be written @xmath110 and implies @xmath111 ( remind that @xmath112 ) . more generally , one can replace @xmath43 by any @xmath113 satisfying @xmath114 where the last equality holds in the space @xmath115 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.2.2 ) ) .",

    "this is why we keep the formulation , distinguishing between the solid and the fluid part .",
    "6 .   the definition of a weak solution that we consider can not be satisfactory after collision .",
    "indeed , we do not specify any rebound law .",
    "moreover , in the case of dirichlet conditions at the fluid - solid interface , explicit examples show that the analogue of our weak solution is not unique @xcite .",

    "moreover , such weak solution exists up to collision , that is @xmath133    the rest of the paper will be devoted to the proof of the theorem .",
    "briefly , there are two main difficulties compared to the case of dirichlet conditions :    * the lack of a unified formulation such as . * the lack of a uniform @xmath0 bound on solutions @xmath43 .",
    "these difficulties appear both in the construction of approximate solutions , and in the convergence process .",
    "indeed , the approximation of fluid - solid systems is usually adressed by relaxing the solid constraint , through a penalization term . in this way , one is left with approximate systems that are close to density dependent navier - stokes equations .",
    "roughly , they read @xmath134 in the case of no slip conditions , in which a global formulation of type - already holds , to build such approximation is quite natural .",
    "but in the case of navier conditions , this is not easy .",
    "once an approximate sequence of solutions @xmath135 has been derived , dirichlet conditions allow for uniform @xmath0 bounds on @xmath136 .",
    "this simplifies a lot of convergence arguments , notably with regards to the transport equation @xmath137 to which the classical diperna - lions theory applies straightforwardly @xcite .",
    "also , it helps to provide strong convergence of @xmath136 in @xmath138 . in short",
    ", the lack of bound on @xmath139 ( due to the penalization term ) can be overcome by considering the fields @xmath140 , where @xmath141 is the orthogonal projection in @xmath142 over the fields that are rigid in a @xmath143-neighborhood of @xmath23 .",
    "one can show that @xmath140 has good equicontinuity properties uniformly in @xmath143 and @xmath144 .    in the case of navier boundary conditions",

    "+ \\ii ) in the penalization term @xmath169 . formally , as @xmath144 goes to infinity , this term will allow to recover the rigid constraint inside the solid .",
    "2 .   note that _ a contrario _ to the large penalization term , the viscosity term @xmath170 vanishes asymptotically in the solid part .",
    "hence , there will be no uniform bound in @xmath142 for @xmath164 , as expected ( see the discussion in paragraph [ mainresult ] ) .",
    "a specificity of these approximate problems is that the transport equation * d ) * is nonlinear in @xmath168 for a given @xmath164 .",
    "indeed , @xmath171 depends on @xmath168 ( _ cf _ the formula in section [ transport ] ) .",
    "the whole section [ transport ] is dedicated to this auxiliary nonlinear transport equation , which is a keystone of the approximation procedure .",
    "once the solution @xmath168 of * d ) * is found and seen as a functional of @xmath164 , equation * c ) * can be written as @xmath172 for some functional @xmath173 from @xmath174 into itself . in short",
    ", we shall solve this equation by a galerkin procedure : we shall look for an approximate solution @xmath175 where @xmath176 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath177 .",
    "we shall solve approximate equations @xmath178 by schauder s theorem and pass to the limit with respect to @xmath179 .",

    "the price to pay is the necessary control of @xmath182 , which will exhibit strong gradients near @xmath183 as @xmath184 .",
    "moreover , a similar `` boundary layer behaviour '' will be involved in the approximation of discontinuous test functions @xmath57 by continuous test functions @xmath185 ( involved in * c ) * ) .",
