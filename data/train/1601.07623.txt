    "since the advent of the copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics@xcite , there have been many distinct proposals from quantum physicists with various backgrounds to resolve the problems of measurement and the origin of the quantum state reduction that generates non - unitary time evolution of state vectors@xcite .    in this paper , as a new approach , we address a connection between time itself and non - unitary time evolution in quantum mechanics by extending canonical gravity theory .",
    "our mathematical model is based on the reformulation of canonical gravity as a _",
    "spin system _ by amitabha sen@xcite and part of our approach uses the notion of the penrose uncertainties assigned to superposed space - times@xcite which we relate to the quantum superposition of originally definite particle positions or momenta in a coherent second - quantized system .",
    "an original aspect of our approach is that we extend sen s spin model by introducing in the low - velocity approximation one additional long - range self - interacting massive spinor particle that is physically coupled with sen s spinor . in this paper",
    ", we call it the _ theta particle_. in the present model , we assume that the role of theta particle is such that this particle only interacts with time lapses and the causal structure of the world , that is , the temporal part of the space - time metric , via its coupling to sen s spinor and has _ no _ direct interaction with the standard model elementary particles except for the origin of its mass .    our strategy for deriving non - unitary time evolution in the world , as measured by its proper time , _ of _ a spatially macroscopically coherent quantum matter system by solving the schr@xmath0dinger equation written using time increments is to show that fluctuations of the time increment around its trial mean are induced by a _ phase transition _ , that is , _ spontaneous _ time reparametrization symmetry ( trps ) breaking refers to that of the global symmetry part ( i.e. , the pre - gauged symmetry ) of @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the corresponding _ ground state expectation values _ are functions of the space - time coordinates .",
    "] , where the theta particle plays the role of creating the trp invariant potential . in canonical quantum gravity , trps is manifest in the wheeler - de witt equation of the wave function of the universe and its reduced form in matter systems where there is no newtonian concept of external time and only an internal clock exists@xcite .",
    "such a situation is caused by the fact that , besides canonical gravity being a totally constrained system , the object of its dynamics is the universe itself .    in the quantum mechanical regime ,",
    "our formalism employs a time increment rather than a time parameter in order to treat the statistics of time increments . in the trps broken phase ,",
    "the time increment trials have non - zero statistical variance .",
    "the ratio between the variance and the mean of the time increment trials , denoted by @xmath2 , is the scale of trps breaking with dimensions of time .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the model hamiltonian of spinor gravity coupled to the theta particle based on sen s reformulation of canonical gravity as a spin system . in sec .",
    "iii we describe the mechanism of trps breaking and the consequent non - unitary evolution of quantum systems in our model . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize our results and remark on some interesting features of our model .",
    "in this section , we construct our model . to do this , we start from the reformulation of canonical gravity by sen , keeping its generality.@xcite    in this paper , to study the time evolution of space - time structure , we use the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) @xmath3 decomposition of a space - time @xmath4@xcite in the canonical formalism . in the time evolution of a space - like hypersurface @xmath5 in @xmath6 ,",
    "the initial data are a pair of symmetric tensor fields @xmath7 , that is , the metric @xmath8 ( for which we choose the signature @xmath9 ) induced from @xmath4 and the second fundamental form @xmath10 . in the adm decomposition method ,",
    "the square of the line element in @xmath6 is written as @xmath11 for time lapse function @xmath12 and shift vector @xmath13 .    here , we clarify two points concerning eq.([eq : adm]).@xcite first , when we regard @xmath5 as the embedding of a space manifold @xmath14 into space - time @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath15 , the lapse function @xmath16 and the shift vector @xmath17 are the components of the deformation of the embedding @xmath18 perpendicular and parallel to @xmath5 , respectively .",
    "second , due to their role as lagrange multipliers for the @xmath3 decomposition in the totally constrained system , the lapse function @xmath12 and the shift vector @xmath13 are the time - dependent variables of trps and the space diffeomorphism of @xmath14 , respectively .",
    "the arbitrariness of these four variables in the space - time metric @xmath19 reflects that of a choice of space - time coordinate system .",
    "now , following ref.@xcite , we consider an @xmath20 spinor field variable @xmath21 on @xmath22 and restrict it to @xmath5 .",
    "we call this the _ space spinor_. we denote by @xmath23 the field of unit vectors on @xmath22 that is normal to the family of @xmath5 in the @xmath3 decomposition .",
    "we restrict @xmath23 to @xmath5 and then represent the covariant four - vector @xmath24 , at each point @xmath25 in @xmath5 , by a natural hermitian isomorphism @xmath26 between the complex conjugate space , @xmath27 , of the complex two - dimensional vector space @xmath28 of primed space spinors of arbitrarily given kind at @xmath25 and the dual space , @xmath29 , of the vector space @xmath30 of unprimed space spinors of one kind : @xmath31 here , we lower and raise space spinor indices by contraction with a non - degenerate symplectic form @xmath32 , with which we equip @xmath30 , having a skew pair of space spinor indices .",
    "this isomorphism @xmath26 , as an additional structure on @xmath30 , reduces the structure group acting on @xmath30 at each point @xmath25 from @xmath20 to @xmath33 .",
    "so , space spinors obtained from elements of @xmath30 by varying @xmath25 over @xmath5 are in fact @xmath33 spinors on @xmath5 .",
    "due to this feature of space spinors , we can relate them to the geometry of @xmath5 with the induced negative - definite metric @xmath34 such that @xmath35 holds .",
    "for instance , we can express _ spatial _ tensors on @xmath5 that vanish by contraction with @xmath23 or @xmath36 in terms of space spinors by replacing each spatial tensor index by a symmetric pair of space spinor indices : for example , we write @xmath37 as @xmath38 such that @xmath39 holds for the @xmath33 adjoint @xmath40 , since @xmath41 holds due to the unity of @xmath23 .    to reformulate canonical gravity in terms of space spinors , sen introduced @xmath33 connections @xmath42 by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the derivative operator on @xmath45 and @xmath21 is a space spinor on @xmath5.@xcite moreover , sen modeled the lapse function @xmath12 and the shift vector @xmath46 as two kinds of squares of a space spinor @xmath21@xcite : @xmath47 as a result , time lapses and the causal structure of the world are encoded in sen spinor field @xmath21 .",
    "the total hamiltonian @xmath48 of our model consists of four parts : @xmath49 the proper time @xmath50 of @xmath45 appears in the combination @xmath51 .    in units where @xmath52 and @xmath53 , sen rewrote",

    "our interest lies in the spatial weak - field case @xmath63    now , we are ready to introduce the spin @xmath64 fermionic theta particle field on @xmath5 into our model and extend canonical gravity .",
    "we do this in a way that its four - dimensional spin - variable space matches that of sen spinor field : it is the composite of _ its own _ @xmath21 and a scalar particle .    at this stage",
    "it is necessary to make a technical point . in this study , we hypothesize theta particles to be _ cold dark matter _ and to simplify the model setting , we deal with only theta particles with velocities that are low relative to the speed of light .",
    "then , the theta particle field is approximately described by a non - relativistic pauli @xmath33 two - component spinor field , @xmath65 , on @xmath5 .    in the @xmath66 vector spin model , in which all variables are treated as their field amounts ,",
    "we define the unit modulus and the direction of theta spin by @xmath67 and require that it physically couples to sen spin @xmath21 by two different kinds of strong coupling ( @xmath68 ) : @xmath69 the two terms of @xmath70 are separately invariant under trp and spatial diffeomorphisms .",
    "our system @xmath71 gives energy to sen spin only by its couplings to a theta particle in @xmath70 .",
    "this form of energy enables a certain kind of locally isolated theta particle system to generate a measuring system in quantum mechanics .    here , we make two remarks about eq.([eq : hc ] ) .",
    "first , these physical couplings mean that , in our model , the lapse function and the shift vector play gauge independent roles .",
    "second , the first term of eq.([eq : hc ] ) is regarded as a spin - exchange interaction between two kinds of sen spins with common spin eigenspaces .",
    "a spin - exchange interaction is the reduced form of an orbital interaction that is obtained by suppressing orbital degrees of freedom .",
    "next , we model the hamiltonian of the theta particle field @xmath65 itself as that of a spin model with a long - range ferromagnetic interaction via a massless wave of a continuous succession of spin - exchange interactions , which propagates in the background @xmath21 _ of _ @xmath65 , @xmath72 where in the newtonian limit , @xmath73 for a theta particle field @xmath74 with mass @xmath75 , canonical momentum @xmath76 and a positive - valued long - range decay factor @xmath77 , with a constant @xmath78 , that generates an inverse square law force .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath79 of the matter fields @xmath80 is the matter sector of general relativity@xcite , which consists of the coupling of the lapse function @xmath12 to the component @xmath81 and the coupling of the shift vector @xmath13 to the component @xmath82 as in @xmath83 .    in the form presented here ,",
    "our system @xmath48 manifests a global @xmath33 spin rotation symmetry .",
    "this global symmetry is gauged by the background @xmath21 _ of _ @xmath65 .",
    "the chain of interactions and correlations between @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath80 is schematically shown in the diagram    @xmath86|{(a)}\\ar[r]^{(b)}&\\ar[l]&\\lambda\\ar@(ul , dl)[]|{(c)}\\ar@/_0pt/@{.>}[r]^{(d)}&\\psi\\ar@/_0pt/@{.>}[l]\\ar@/_25pt/@{.>}[lll]_{(e)}}\\;.\\label{eq : int}\\ ] ]    in our model , while @xmath87 is a short - range interaction , @xmath88 is a long - range self - interaction .",
    "the process @xmath89 defines the lapse function @xmath12 and the shift vector @xmath13 , and the right - directed arrow of @xmath90 arises from time - dependent processes in the world for @xmath80 with its proper time including the adm time lapse . [ for the derivation of the matter schr@xmath0dinger equation from the wheeler - de witt equation in the wkb approximation , see ref.@xcite . ]",
    "the correlation @xmath91 is indirect .",
    "as will be remarked at the end of this paper , @xmath91 is causally a _",
    "one - way _ process .",
    "this paper s main statement is that , in our model , trps can be broken in time - dependent processes in the world for a spatially macroscopically coherent quantum matter system @xmath80 and this trps breaking leads to non - unitary time evolution in this world .    throughout this paper , the term _ coherence _",
    "is used with the meaning of quantum coherence of superposed de broglie waves and superposed photons@xcite .    in this section ,",
    "we describe the mechanism behind our main statement based on the diagram shown as eq.([eq : int ] ) . in the following ,",
    "we denote the first and the second terms of @xmath70 by @xmath92 and @xmath93 , respectively .",
    "we assume a second - quantized matter system @xmath80 of @xmath95-number of identical particles , with the coherence of @xmath80 limited by macroscopic lengths @xmath96 ( @xmath97 ) at a time @xmath98 .",
    "then , the existence of the macroscopically , in the quantum mechanical sense , ferromagnetically ordered distribution of @xmath95-number of sen spins over the time - dependent _ coherence domain _ of @xmath80 in @xmath5 at the time @xmath98 follows .",
    "( the @xmath95-number of sen spins stochastically accompany a second - quantized @xmath95-body system @xmath80 comprising arbitrary kinds of particles , with the same probability as @xmath80 , while the position uncertainty of @xmath80 is kept . )",
    "the key fact for showing this existence is that the dimensions @xmath96 of the coherence domain are smaller than the spatial stochastic means of the penrose position uncertainties @xmath99 , in the identification between the space - times having the probability amplitudes of @xmath80 under superposition , taken as the root mean square error ( see below ) in spatial identification at each point @xmath100 in the time slice @xmath5 for @xmath97 , respectively : @xmath101 for a field of unit vectors @xmath102 , the root mean squares @xmath103 weighted by the one - particle probability density @xmath104 of @xmath80 in the particle picture as in @xmath105 itself@xcite , the vector modulus of the expectation values @xmath106 , and the mandelstam - tamm time interval @xmath107@xcite characteristic of the rate of change of the system @xmath45 itself at the time @xmath98 .",
    "( note three points : @xmath105 can be determined only stochastically , each @xmath108 is not a canonical variable of @xmath109 , and @xmath21 has no orbital degree of freedom . ) in eq.([eq : dpo ] ) , @xmath110 is the direction of the group velocity @xmath111 of the displacement of @xmath5 in @xmath22",
    ". this direction is arbitrarily chosen , due to the @xmath33 gauge symmetry , and needs to be definite within the coherence domain that is analogous to a moving wave packet .",
    "when we define the _ magnetization _ @xmath22 of a system of uniformly distributed spins by the vector modulus of ( weighted ) arithmetic means of the spin vector components over this system , eq.([eq : dpo ] ) shows that approximately a finite magnetization , weighted by @xmath112 , of @xmath95-number of expected sen spatial spin vectors of the order of @xmath113 is generated for the root mean square @xmath114 weighted by @xmath112 .",
    "when @xmath95 is large enough , the configuration of added sen spins generates a magnetized ( i.e. , ferromagnetically ordered ) distribution of spin vectors of theta particles @xmath115 via the strong ferromagnetic coupling @xmath116 .",
    "this effect induces the spontaneous breaking of the @xmath33 gauge symmetry of the total spin system within the coherence domain . here ,",
    "an important point is that , due to eq.([eq : xy ] ) , interactions between these aligned theta spins in the magnetized system are attractive . such that @xmath117 is the trps breaking scale ( i.e. , the fluctuation scale of the proper time ) @xmath2 and above .",
    "then , spatial diffeomorphism invariance within the coherence domain would be broken spontaneously .",

    "1 . the gray curve in each graph is the edge of the lynden - bell equilibrium of the system at zero temperature.,title=\"fig : \" ]    here , two remarks on the _ collisionless equilibrium _ are made .",
    "first , in the collisionless equilibrium of a long - range interacting system , the variable of the fine - grained vlasov distribution is the one - particle energy only.@xcite the second remark concerns the persistence of this equilibrium .",
    "a general property of long - range interacting systems means that , in the thermodynamic limit , the theta particle system never approaches the boltzmann - gibbs equilibrium from the collisionless equilibrium and its kinetics is fully governed by the vlasov equation when we discuss nonequilibrium properties.@xcite      in this step , we show that the trps breaking arises from the fact that , in the theta particle ground state , there are two _ coexisting _ different time lapse structures , coming from @xmath139 , with respect to the two lynden - bell energy distributions @xmath140 ( @xmath126 ) at zero temperature@xcite .",
    "we begin by noting that , in the total spin system , the theta particle that is coupled with the sen spin at a point @xmath100 on @xmath5 changes with time .",
    "this is because , while the sen spin is localized at every point in @xmath5 , every theta particle has momentum . in the collisionless equilibrium of the theta particle system , this itinerant property is reduced to the stationary distributions @xmath140 for @xmath126 . in the following ,",
    "we denote by @xmath141 for @xmath126 the integrals over the momentum and the spin parts of @xmath140 with the spin direction dependence fixed by @xmath142 in step a.    in the theta particle ground state , @xmath139 can be written as @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the theta particle number of the system , @xmath145 counts the couplings between the localized sen spin at a point @xmath100 on @xmath5 and an itinerant theta spin in @xmath146 , and the form of each coarse - grained position distribution @xmath141 is determined by the fermi energy of the lynden - bell distribution @xmath140 and the form of the self - consistent mean - field potential of the second term of eq.([eq : xy ] ) ( refer to fig .",
    "2 ) .    here , @xmath147 is the trp invariant potential for time lapse @xmath12 .",
    "the main property of this potential is that it gives distinct energetic degeneracies , with respect to trp , for two different time lapse densities @xmath148 for @xmath126 . owing to their differing trp degeneracies , the two time lapse densities define different proper times @xmath149 of @xmath140 and corresponding time lapses @xmath150 .",
    "this property of @xmath147 is confirmed by noting that , in the particle description , @xmath147 is written as @xmath151 where time lapses @xmath152 correspond to the time lapse densities @xmath148 in eq.([eq : pot ] ) .",
    "here , we note that this coarse - graining is applied not to the proper time @xmath135 but to the energy @xmath147 , so @xmath147 is necessary and @xmath153 needs to be non - zero . due to this property of @xmath147 ,",
    "the ground state of the total spin system is in the form @xmath154 this expression means that for @xmath126 , @xmath155 where @xmath156 is the fraction of theta particles in @xmath146 .",
    "in eq.([eq : ti ] ) , for @xmath126 , the first and the second equalities define , respectively , @xmath150 and the @xmath85-dependence of @xmath157 in a spatially infinitesimal manner .    now , we show that trps on the lapse function @xmath12 does not hold due to its inconsistency with the theta particle part of @xmath158 : trps is preserved for @xmath159 , which is equivalent to the trp invariance of @xmath147 , but non - zero @xmath160 breaks trps spontaneously .",
    "the crucial point here is that , due to the _ superposition form _ of the distribution @xmath158 and the singleness of its non - zero fine - grained level , for every theta or sen spin , it is in principle impossible to specify to which component @xmath157 this spin belongs , in the phase space region of overlap between @xmath122 and @xmath123 .",
    "this is the novel feature of the double lynden - bell distribution as an equilibrium distribution ( refer to figs.1 and 2)@xcite and is the mainstay of this paper . due to this point , in the ground state @xmath158 , trp , that is , a replacement of the clock in the theta particle system@xmath161is required to be applied for both proper times @xmath149 for @xmath126 by a single correspondence rule ( i.e. , a single time lapse ) between clock and proper time due to the singleness of @xmath158 .",
    "thus , one of the two proper times becomes an obvious constraint on trp for the other proper time , which breaks trps on the lapse function @xmath12 spontaneously in a collisionless equilibrium theta particle system .      by the above step ,",
    "once trps breaks spontaneously , the lapse function decomposes into @xmath163 for ground state expectation value @xmath164 and fluctuation @xmath165 .",
    "thus , the proper time @xmath135 also decomposes into @xmath166 for ground state expectation value @xmath167 and fluctuation @xmath168",
    ". this decomposition in eq.([eq : tt ] ) arises because , according to the adm spatial coordinate transformation of the space - time @xmath169 with the signature @xmath170 , we set the proper time of the local theta particle system , which is , in the present case , also that of the matter system @xmath80 , as @xmath171 by employing an _ a priori _ and reversibly flowing time @xmath98 that is used in the adm decomposition just as a parameter .",
    "consequently , the trials of time increment @xmath172 fluctuate around the trial mean with a non - zero relative variance @xmath2 that sets the time scale of symmetry breaking . here , it is consistent to assume that the behavior of the time increment fluctuation is governed by a certain statistical law , which is independent from the model .",
    "in particular , its relative variance @xmath2 is to be treated as a physical constant of nature . as will be shown in the next part , in our model , the time @xmath173 within whose interval the state reduction of the matter system @xmath80 itself occurs is estimated by @xmath174 for the unit time scale @xmath175 of quantum mechanical phenomena in the matter system @xmath80 .",
    "so , to determine the value of @xmath2 , we require experimental comparisons with this formula for particular matter systems .      in time - dependent processes of the matter system @xmath80 with its hamiltonian @xmath177 , the statistical variance of time increment trials",
    "is represented by the non - unitary time evolution of the state vector of the system @xmath80 in the schr@xmath178dinger picture , as seen in the following way . in the schr@xmath178dinger picture ,",
    "the time - evolution equation of the state vector @xmath179 of the matter system @xmath80 is the schr@xmath178dinger equation .",
    "we write it in the time increment formalism using the proper time of both the local theta particle system and the matter system @xmath80 @xmath180 the average of its formal solution over time increment trials is @xmath181 when time increment trials @xmath172 are simply assumed to follow a normal distribution @xmath182 with mean @xmath124 and variance @xmath183 .",
    "this formula gives the time evolution of the state vector in the history representation : @xmath184 the first exponential factor gives unitary time evolution .",
    "to understand the meaning of the second exponential factor in a formal way , we note the following points . in quantum mechanics ,",
    "a hamiltonian @xmath185 is an hermitian operator .",
    "so , for its real eigenvalues @xmath186 , there exists a unique spectral family @xmath187 . here , the spectral component @xmath188 is defined by the restriction of @xmath177 to the part which lies within the eigenspace for eigenvalue @xmath85 .",
    "the spectral decomposition of the hamiltonian is @xmath189 from the projection property of the spectral components @xmath190 it follows that @xmath191 due to this , on average , the second exponential factor in eq.([eq : sol ] ) forms a family with the properties of a contraction semi - group with parameter @xmath135 .",
    "now , it is clear that this factor causes the irreversible non - unitary time evolution of @xmath192 for energy eigenstates @xmath193 and complex coefficients @xmath194 .",
    "this time evolution is a quantum state reduction with respect to energy . indeed ,",
    "when we describe this time evolution statistically , by solving the corresponding von neumann equation , it follows that the non - diagonal elements of the density matrix of an energy pure state are damped exponentially with time constant @xmath173 .",
    "finally , we extend this discussion to the case of the complex quantum system of the matter system @xmath80 and the sen spin system @xmath21 , or equivalently , @xmath195 , in the coherence domain of @xmath80 . in the quantum regime of the sen spin system , we need to introduce its state vectors , since orbit - less sen spinor fields @xmath21 and @xmath196 are replaced by quantum field operators of unconstrained schwinger bosons . as a remarkable point",
    ", the hilbert space of state vectors of the complex system @xmath197 , @xmath198 , decomposes into a direct integral of mutually _ unitarily inequivalent _ coherent subspaces ( i.e. , superselection sectors ) , @xmath199 , as @xmath200 where @xmath201 is the set of all ground state expectation values of the lapse function @xmath12 and the shift vector @xmath13 in the total spin system ( refer to footnote 48 ) and @xmath124 is the space - time diffeomorphism invariant functional measure .",
    "this unitary inequivalence is attributed to the spontaneous breaking of space - time diffeomorphism invariance in the total spin system where sen spin system has an infinite number of field degrees of freedom and infinitely many unitarily inequivalent coherent states exist where each state is specified by a pair of classical fields @xmath195@xcite .",
    "now , based on this fact , we assume an arbitrarily given observable @xmath202 , depended on by gravity , of a given quantum system @xmath203 with set of eigenstates @xmath204 and consider the complex system of @xmath203 and @xmath197 with the von neumann form interaction that is a result of gravity and the equivalence principle takes the form @xmath205 where @xmath206 acts only in the hilbert space of the system @xmath197 such that @xmath207 , the times evolved by @xmath206 , belong to different superselection sectors for each @xmath95@xcite . ] . then , state vectors of the total system @xmath208 in the von neumann superposition form , such as @xmath209 where @xmath210 and @xmath211 are distinct and no condition is imposed on @xmath212 or @xmath213 , automatically become mixtures , due to the superselection property of @xmath207 , within their own time scale such that , by it , the proper time difference reaches the planck time . moreover , if @xmath212 and @xmath213 are energy eigenstates with different eigenvalues , a measurement of @xmath202 of the system @xmath203 by the complex system @xmath197 follows from eq.([eq : sol ] ) as a state reduction in the matter system @xmath80 within a time scale @xmath173 .    with this final step ,",
    "our mechanism to derive a quantum mechanical non - unitary time - dependent process @xmath90 in the world for a macroscopically spatially coherent matter system @xmath80 via trps breaking @xmath214&(a)\\ar[r]&(b)\\ar[r]&(c)\\ar[r]&(d)}\\label{eq : summary}\\ ] ] is complete .",
    "in our model , we have proposed to replace the scheme of the copenhagen school quantum mechanics ( q.m . ) of a self - contained matter system @xmath80 , that consists of unitary time - dependent process and non - unitary events , in the history description with time @xmath135@xcite @xmath215|{(d^\\prime)}}\\ \\",
    "{ \\rm{in}}\\ \\ { \\rm{q.m.}}\\label{eq : qm}\\ ] ] by the scheme shown in eq.([eq : int ] ) consisting of @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath80 ( or even without @xmath80 , as noted at the end of this paper ) in the time increment description .",
    "( in our interpretation of quantum mechanics , while the positions and momenta of the localizable second - quantized particles in @xmath80 are originally definite variables , their uncertainties are owned by space - like hypersurfaces at a time , via the momentum constraint in the case of momenta .",
    "these hypersurfaces unite with their background @xmath80 to form quantum eigenstates of the observable position or momentum under superposition .",
    "the observable position and momentum are mutually exclusively definite canonical variables . because the spin is independent from the spatial motion ,",
    "we treat it separately . ) summarizing the contents of the diagram eq.([eq : int ] ) briefly , the local theta particle system @xmath84 , whose superposed form collisionless equilibrium ( i.e. , double lynden - bell ) distribution is dynamically generated from the initial distribution prepared by the matter system @xmath80 , provided it is coherent , via the coupling of its vector part with the shift vector , converts the reversibly flowing time @xmath98 into an irreversibly flowing ( see the argument below ) proper time @xmath135 with increments fluctuating within the world for the matter system @xmath80 by the spontaneous breaking of trps due to the existence of the trp invariant double lynden - bell potential eq.([eq : pot ] ) for the time lapse ( spatial diffeomorphism invariance is also broken spontaneously ) ; the time lapse is rescaled in the ground state eq.([eq : gstate ] ) in two ways . by solving the schr@xmath178dinger or the von neumann equation written in the time increment formalism ( e.g. , eq.([eq : sch ] ) ) ,",
    "we have shown that this conversion of time results in non - unitary events , which include gravitational state mixings and measurements , in the world for the matter system @xmath80 , with irreversibility arising from using the time fluctuations @xmath168 in eq.([eq : tt ] ) but expressed by using the _ a priori _ reversible temporal flow @xmath98 .    linking to the timeless property of canonical quantum gravity@xcite",
    ", it is to be noted that , in the trps unbroken phase , quantum mechanical unitary processes as temporal steps with a time measure are in principle indistinguishable due to the gauge symmetry nature of trps . when a local theta particle system induces the trps broken phase",
    ", there arises a definite time measure due to @xmath167 in eq.([eq : tt ] ) and these processes become distinguishable .",
    "it is worthwhile to briefly compare our proposal for resolving the measurement problem with a few other proposals that have formal completeness in the description by a state vector .",
    "first , the essential difference from the program of quantum decoherence@xcite is that , while that approach must describe the process statistically using the mixed state of the quantum system with a density matrix , our mechanism works fundamentally with pure states .",
    "second , compared with the continuous spontaneous collapse model in ref.@xcite , the advantage of our model is that , while the evolution law of the continuous spontaneous collapse model is modified _ a priori _ , ours is not except for the scale of symmetry breaking ; in particular , our time - evolution equation is not modified from the schr@xmath216dinger equation .",
    "third , the novel result that definitively distinguishes our proposal from others is a consistent introduction of the universal scheme of quantum measurements shown in eq.([eq : int ] ) as an extension of canonical gravity theory .",
    "finally , a particularly novel feature of our proposal is that , in the mechanism invoking gravity , the main source of its properties is not gravity itself but a particle , that is , the theta particle , which we hypothesize to be cold dark matter . this feature and our gravitational state mixing mechanism",
    "distinguish our proposal from the di@xmath217si - penrose proposal _ for quantum state reduction_@xcite .",
    "first , we have argued that a matter system @xmath80 may produce a marked double lynden - bell distribution of theta particles .",
    "however , in reverse , a marked double lynden - bell distribution of theta particles does _ not always _ require a matter system that produces it . indeed , the higher chemical potential part of the marked double lynden - bell distribution of a local theta particle system , comparable to the cyan domains in figs . 1 and 2 , covers a highly improbable region of the phase space from the aspect of lynden - bell statistics , comparable to the gray curves in figs . 1 and 2 , and once it is generated , this part is trapped in this phase space region until it evaporates@xcite and is unable to thermalize with the rest of the system by the regular local theta particle dynamics in eq.([eq : xy])@xcite .",
    "thus , the local theta particle system still induces the broken phase of space - time diffeomorphism invariance , even after the matter system @xmath80 is lost .",
    "this observation shows that , to be accurate , _ the world for a matter system @xmath80 _ used so far must be generalized to _ the world for a local theta particle system @xmath84_.    second , in the quantum mechanical regime of theta particle system , there is pairing instability in the ground state , since the theta particle is a fermion and its self - interactions through the aligned spin are attractive@xcite . in such a situation",
    ", we expect the realization of superconductivity - like macroscopically coherent behavior of quantum theta particles evading the pauli exclusion principle , below a certain critical temperature .",
    "if our proposed mechanism can be tested experimentally , investigating this aspect of our model , especially determining the scale of the critical temperature at the same time as we primarily determine the scales of coupling strengths and mass of theta particles and the scale of trps breaking , will be a significant issue .",
