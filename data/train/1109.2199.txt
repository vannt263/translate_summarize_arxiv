    "between 1937 and 1941 a series of papers specified the characteristics of interstellar extinction in the visible , provided a better understanding of the processes at work , and set the general frame - work for all forthcoming studies . @xcite proved that extinction of a star s light in the visible was not of the rayleigh type ( @xmath5 ) as previously thought , with @xmath6 close to 1 , wavelength dependence of interstellar extinction came from @xcite , in opposition to previous suggestions of a rayleigh @xmath7 extinction @xcite . ] , but was very close to a decaying exponential of @xmath8 ( @xmath9 , that is the visible extinction law was linear in @xmath8 ) .",
    "such laws are common in nature ( atmospheric aerosols , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] , are the best but not the only example ) , and attributed to size distributions of particles , with no specific implication on their chemical composition . these distributions are usually associated with large albedos and strong forward scattering phase functions , two properties which in the case of interstellar dust were confirmed in 1940 @xcite .",
    "linear extinction laws are defined by two parameters , their slope , proportional to the reddening @xmath10 on the line of sight , and the extinction at a specific wavelength @xmath11 .",
    "the extinction at wavelength @xmath12 normalized by the reddening , @xmath13 , depends on the absolute extinction to color excess ratio ( @xmath1 in the johnson photometric system ) alone ( sects .",

    "greenstein found good spatial homogeneity of interstellar extinction . assuming that the extinction law goes to 0 in the infrared @xcite a value of @xmath14",
    "is obtained ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "in contrast @xcite found from a statistical analysis of the mean reddening at two different wavelengths that interstellar extinction becomes zero at 3.2  @xmath15 m , which implies @xmath16 .    since the 1940s",
    "the debate on interstellar extinction has focused on four essential questions .",
    "how close to a perfect exponential is the extinction of starlight in the visible ?",
    "does extinction vary from direction to direction ( from an interstellar cloud to another ) ? on how many parameters",
    "does it depend ?",
    "how does it constrain the composition of interstellar dust ?    the purpose of this paper is to evaluate which logical conclusions on interstellar extinction in the visible and the near - infrared ( @xmath17 m ) may be reached from an analysis of the abundant and often contradictory literature on the subject : what is the shape of the visible extinction curve ? is the key parameter @xmath1 a constant or is it highly variable , as different studies separately claim , and what is its value(s ) ? can extinction in the uv or in the infrared be related to the visible extinction and to the value of @xmath1 ?",

    "[ evis ] to [ euv ] review the main features of interstellar extinction in three wavelength domains which have been used to investigate the value of @xmath1 , the visible , the infrared ( near and mid - infrared , @xmath18 m ) , and the uv .",

    "[ dis ] attempts to give the most logical responses to the questions raised in the previous paragraph .",
    "let @xmath19 be the flux of a reddened star , measured on earth , and @xmath20 that of an unreddened star of same spectral type .",
    "the quantity which is readily accessible through observation is the excess of extinction of the reddened star at wavelength @xmath12 over the extinction at a given wavelength @xmath21 , @xmath22 extinction in different directions can be normalized to the same amount of reddening between @xmath21 and another given wavelength @xmath23 by dividing @xmath24 by @xmath25 .",
    "normalized extinction curves are defined by @xmath26 with @xmath27 @xmath28 measures the extinction per unit amount of interstellar matter along the line of sight .",
    "normalized extinction curves @xmath29 in different directions all pass through the points @xmath30 and @xmath31 in the @xmath32 plane , and have the same mean slope , @xmath33 . for extinction to be the same in different directions normalized extinction curves need to be identical . in this case knowledge of @xmath25",
    "fixes the amount of extinction and the quantity of interstellar dust on the line of sight at all wavelengths . if @xmath29 varies with direction extinction depends on e(b - v ) and one or more additional parameters .",
    "two systems of normalization , @xmath34 and @xmath35 can be converted one into the other by @xmath36 in nandy s system @xcite , @xmath37 and @xmath38 were chosen to give a mean slope of unity . in the @xcite photometric system ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 )",
    "the slope is 2.22 , and normalized extinction curves are defined by @xmath41 with @xmath42 @xmath43 and @xmath44 are the extinction cross - sections of interstellar dust in the b and v bands in the direction of the observation .",
    "[ eq : g0 ] emphasizes the importance of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is known , @xmath45 becomes measurable at all wavelengths .",
    "[ eq : rv ] shows that @xmath1 depends only on the extinction properties of interstellar dust in the b and v bands ( along the line of sight ) .",
    "identical normalized extinction curves in different directions certainly imply equality of @xmath1 in these directions .",
    "the constancy or not of @xmath1 and its exact value(s ) determine our ability to evaluate @xmath45 in any direction , to correct observations of far - away objects for foreground reddening , and to parametrize interstellar dust models .",
    "the @xcite derivation of @xmath45 in different photometric bands from @xmath46 for instance relies on the assumption that @xmath1 is constant and equal to 3.1 ; their estimate of interstellar extinction in any direction is widely used today .    there is no direct and straightforward way to estimate @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath46 is deduced from a star spectral type and flux ratio between the b and v bands but @xmath2 can not be ascertained unless the star absolute luminosity and distance are precisely known .",
    "existing determinations of @xmath1 rely on indirect methods , the extension of @xmath47 to the infrared ( sect .",
    "[ enir ] ) , estimates of @xmath2 , or on the uv extinction curve ( sect .",
    "with the exception of divan s work @xcite spectral studies of interstellar extinction in the visible are rare . there is a lack of a large , reliable data - base of stellar spectra free from atmospheric extinction , such as exists in the uv ( the iue data - base ) .",
    "spectra in analytical form did not become common before the 1950 - 1960s and a precise removal of atmospheric extinction ( which also has a dependence on @xmath8 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] ) is not obvious .",
    "photometry , sometimes from only a few data - points , has been the standard means to study extinction in the visible , although it is less accurate than spectral analysis can be .    the upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] is the ratio @xmath48 , in the [ 1250   , 8000   ] wavelength range , for the star hd46223 . with an excellent precision",
    "the visible part of the spectrum follows a decaying exponential of @xmath8 ( and diverges from it in the uv ) .",
    "this exponential decrease of the extinction of starlight in the visible is confirmed by most studies of visible normalized extinction curves .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and more recently @xcite found the same @xmath49 in all directions ( over the visible domain ) .",
    "the most extensive data - set of extinction curves in the visible was gathered by nandy in the 1960 - 1970s ( see review , @xcite ) .",
    "the extinction curve weighted over a large number of observations that he derived in 1964 @xcite is reproduced in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "it is to a high degree of accuracy linear in the visible from 2.3  @xmath50 ( 4350   ) to 0.8  @xmath50 ( @xmath51 m ) in the near - infrared @xcite .    in this wavelength range the exponential dependence of @xmath52",
    "can equally be expressed as @xmath53 or by @xmath54 from eqs .",
    "[ eq : f ] and [ eq : al ] @xmath55 the extinction per unit reddening is @xmath56",
    "observed extinction curves are linear only in the visible and part of the near - infrared domain .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] shows that the curve deviates in the near - uv above @xmath57 ( shortly after the @xmath58-band ) where there is less extinction than expected . the error margin on fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] increases dramatically because extinction in the uv no longer depends on @xmath46 alone ( sect .",
    "[ euv ] ) .    in the infrared extinction is much less than at shorter wavelengths .",
    "error margins are large and the extinction curve is difficult to ascertain .",
    "infrared extinction data are limited to a few photometric bands , and thermal emission from dust grains shows up above a few @xmath15 m ( @xcite and references therein ) . below @xmath59 published mid - infrared extinction laws do not follow the visible law ( @xcite , figs .  1 and 2 in @xcite , fig .  2 in @xcite ) .",
    "the extinction curve seems to flatten shortward of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) and extinction may be larger than predicted by the linear behavior in the visible .",
    "mid - infrared extinction was used @xcite to probe variations of @xmath1 ( @xmath62 , eq .  [ eq : g0 ] ) .",
    "these findings are contradicted by several studies @xcite , sometimes even in the same regions of the sky .",
    "there is today no tangible proof of spatial variations of the extinction in the infrared .",
    "the legitimacy of using the infrared to determine @xmath1 is also questionable , especially with respect to the spatial constancy of @xmath63 in the visible wavelength range ( sect .",
    "[ dis ] and @xcite ) .",
    "the uv extinction curve exhibits the well - known 2200    bump feature ( upper plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) ; the extinction is less than expected from the continuation of the visible extinction curve ( figs .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) .",
    "early in the 1970s it was recognized that normalized @xmath64 curves depend on direction : @xmath46 alone is not enough to determine the whole extinction curve .",
    "these properties have largely contributed to the development of new interstellar dust models ( see @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite ( ccm in the following ) proved in 1989 that most normalized curves with a bump can be deduced from a function of @xmath8 which depends upon a single parameter , @xmath65 . in the ccm framework",
    "the size of the bump depends on @xmath46 only ( this is a crude approximation , see @xcite ) while the free parameter determines the average slope of the extinction curve ( with respect to the one in the visible ) and its shape in the far - uv .",
    "@xcite assume that @xmath65 is equal to @xmath1 , an affirmation to be discussed in sect .",
    "[ rv ] .    cases also exist where the linear visible extinction extends to the near - uv , eventually to the far - uv ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] ) . a linear extinction curve over all the visible - uv can be found in the directions of very low column density within the galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , bottom plot , and @xcite ) ; similar extinction curves are observed in the magellanic clouds along lines of sight with even higher column density @xcite . in some directions , hd62542 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] , middle plot ) or hd29647 in our galaxy , sk-69228 and sk-70116 in the lmc @xcite , the extinction is linear down to the bump region and diverges from linearity in the far - uv only .",
    "all these directions have no bump and can not be fitted by the ccm function .",
    "the ccm fit can be improved to include linear extinction curves @xcite .",
    "if , in the visible , normalized extinction curves @xmath64 do not depend on direction ( sect .",
    "[ evis ] ) there is no reason why the relative extinction cross - sections of interstellar grains in the r and b bands ( eq .  [ eq : rv ] ) should vary , and @xmath1 should remain constant ( sect .  [ def ] ) .",
    "paradoxically the constancy of @xmath1 is disputed not so much from the study of interstellar extinction in the visible itself but from indirect and generally more speculative methods , which often involve the extinction in other wavelength ranges .",
    "they rely either on infrared data ( which are not conclusive , sect .",
    "[ enir ] ) ; on tentative estimates of @xmath2 ; or on the ccm fit of uv extinction curves ( sect .",
    "[ euv ] ) .    direct determination of @xmath2 uses star count methods or open clusters distance estimates .",
    "star counts for the same region have resulted to contradictory conclusions regarding the nature and variability of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the values of @xmath1 range from 3 to 6 @xcite .",
    "distance estimates of open clusters are no more convincing . in a recent article @xcite",
    "shows that the distance to open cluster shorlin  1 should be revised from over 10  kpc to less than 3  kpc and thereby demonstrates the large errors which are associated to distance estimates by means of photometry .",
    "the same paper also lists some thirty determinations of @xmath1 in the carina region which range from 3 to 5.2 .",
    "such variations over a small area of the sky are obviously difficult to reconcile with the constancy of @xmath47 found by nandy , divan , bondar , and others ( sect .",
    "[ evis ] ) .",
    "the same remark applies to the uv .",
    "the use ( since 1989 ) of the ccm fit to probe large and local variations of @xmath1 is questionable .",
    "the free parameter @xmath65 of an extinction curve is obtained from eq .  1 in ccm @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are functions of @xmath69 alone @xcite .",
    "for the b band ( @xmath70 ) eq .",
    "[ eq : ccm ] yields , in any direction @xmath71 or @xmath72 if @xmath73 @xmath74 should @xmath65 be equal to @xmath1 eq .",
    "[ eq : rvccm ] shows that it would have to be a constant ( from eq .",
    "[ eq : rvccm ] and eqs .",
    "3a and 3b in ccm : @xmath75 ) independent of direction .",
    "this is in contradiction with the fact that the free parameter of the ccm parameterization , @xmath65 , varies according to direction .",
    "@xmath1 is therefore unlikely to be the free parameter of the ccm function .",
    "it is further difficult to conceive how @xmath65 , which in practice fixes the average uv slope of the ccm fit with respect to the mean slope of @xmath64 in the visible ( fig .  4 in @xcite and @xcite )",
    ", can influence the visible extinction curve , let alone @xmath1 .",
    "it also should be noted that the parameter @xmath65 is highly sensitive to the estimated value of @xmath46 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) , and is not necessarily the same whether the ccm law or its improved formulation in @xcite are employed .",
    "last , @xmath65 barely agrees with the value of @xmath1 derived by other methods , which find , using similar data - sets , either different values in the same region ( in the magellanic clouds for instance @xcite ) or a constant @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the interstellar extinction curve is now accessible through the entire spectrum although studies in each of the three wavelength regions ( the infrared , the visible , and the uv ) are generally done separately and rely on observations with different quality , sensitivity , and resolution . in the infrared",
    "there is no conclusive evidence that interstellar extinction should depend on another parameter in addition to @xmath46 ( sect .",
    "[ enir ] and @xcite ) .",
    "extinction in the uv , although the best documented , remains to be understood .",
    "the @xcite paper had a strong impact and was a remarkable breakthrough .",
    "it proved that interstellar extinction in the uv depends on @xmath46 and on an additional parameter only .",
    "the ccm function , representative of normalized extinction curves with a bump at 2200   , is however purely empirical and void of physical significance .",
    "its free parameter is unlikely to be @xmath1 ( sect .",
    "the nature of the parameter which governs uv extinction is still to be determined .    over sixty years of observations support a linear extinction law in the visible , with @xmath64 normalized extinction curves independent of direction ( sect .",
    "[ evis ] ) .",
    "linear extinction laws are attributed to grain size distributions ( @xmath76 in @xcite ) .",
    "they have no implication for the chemical composition of the grains responsible for the extinction : extinction by aerosols in the atmosphere , like interstellar dust , follows a similar law .",
    "the extinction at a specific wavelength is due to particles of size close to the wavelength .",
    "the spatial uniformity of @xmath64 in the visible strongly favors a constant value of @xmath1 ( sect .",
    "[ def ] ) .",
    "estimates of @xmath2 in different directions , which essentially are of a statistical character ( @xcite and sect .  [ enir ] ) , suggest that @xmath1 should be between 3 and 6 .",
    "the flattening of the extinction curve observed in the near - infrared ( fig .  2 in @xcite ) , which interrupts the linear decrease of @xmath64 towards the longest wavelengths ,",
    "was used to derive a value of @xmath1 close to 3 .",
    "if @xmath1 is indeed close to 3 , eq .",
    "[ eq : fn ] may be rewritten as @xmath77 it is however arbitrary to determine @xmath1 from infrared data since below 0.8  @xmath50 the interstellar extinction curve seems not to follow the same analytical law as in the visible .",
    "@xmath1 should depend on the distribution of those interstellar dust grains with sizes close to @xmath78 and @xmath79 and be determined from the extension to longer wavelengths of @xmath13 rather than from the observed mid - infrared data .",
    "the mid - infrared flattening , should it be confirmed , may as well result from a process independent from the extinction at shorter wavelengths , from a change in grain - size distribution for the largest interstellar grains for instance .",
    "a general difficulty in discussing these estimates of @xmath1 is that @xmath1 can be defined in different ways which do not necessarily have the same meaning .",
    "the exact definition , @xmath0 , involves only the reddening in the @xmath58 and @xmath80 bands . because direct determination of these quantities is particularly difficult alternative definitions rely on the limit of @xmath81 , and on the supposition that @xmath82 which is true only if there is no gray ( neutral ) extinction .",
    "but the @xmath81 limit can also be considered in two ways , either by taking the limit of mid - infrared observations , as it is generally done , or by continuing nandy s linear extinction law ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) to the longer wavelengths .    as stated above the infrared method , which leads to @xmath83 and to eq .",
    "[ eq : rv3 ] , is not consistent with the original definition of @xmath1 .",
    "if there is a flattening of the extinction in the near - infrared @xmath84 must be smaller than @xmath85 and underestimates @xmath1 .    if nandy s curve in the visible alone is considered , provided that the @xmath58-band lies within the limits of the linear part of normalized extinction curves ( that is , if @xmath86 is not or little affected by the near - uv departure from linearity , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] ) , and assuming no gray extinction , eqs .",
    "[ eq : g0 ] and [ eq : g0l ] necessarily imply @xmath14 .",
    "this conclusion can be re - formulated in the following way .",
    "if linear normalized extinction curves in the visible were to be considered alone one would expect , from any size distribution of particles , that the coefficient in front of the exponential in eq .",
    "[ eq : rv3 ] be less than 1 ( instead of 2.5 ) . in absence of neutral extinction , which is presumed to be the case for interstellar dust @xcite , this coefficient , @xmath87 in eq .",
    "[ eq : f ] ( or @xmath88 in eq .",
    "[ eq : fn ] ) , should be 1 .",
    "then @xmath89 @xmath14 is precisely the value @xcite has obtained from his most recent photometric measurements in the carina region .",
    "this value is not `` anomalous '' as it was often suggested , but rather appears as a logical outcome of the linearity of interstellar extinction in the visible .",
    "this paper was motivated by the large and logically incompatible discrepancies that appear from a survey of the existing literature on the determination of @xmath1 .",
    "depending on the study @xmath1 has been found to be either constant and independent of the line of sight or highly variable from one direction to another .",
    "it is my conclusion that the normalized visible extinction law is most likely linear and independent of direction so that @xmath1 should be the same constant for all directions .",
    "although a value close to 3 is generally preferred , @xmath14 would more naturally fit with the linear extinction law found in the visible .",
