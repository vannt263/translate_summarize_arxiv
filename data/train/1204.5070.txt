    "the recurrence coefficients of semi - classical weights usually obey nonlinear recurrence relations , which , in many cases , can be identified as discrete painlev equations ; see for instance @xcite and the references therein .",
    "moreover , when viewed as functions of one of the parameters in the weight , the recurrence coefficients satisfy ( continuous ) painlev equations ( see @xcite in case of the discrete semi - classical meixner and charlier weights and @xcite and the references therein for other semi - classical continuous weights ) .",
    "this paper gives another example of the connection between discrete orthogonal polynomials and the painlev equations .",

    "the recurrence coefficients for the orthonormal krawtchouk  polynomials are given by @xmath40 observe that @xmath41 .",
    "in this paper , we are concerned with a semi - classical generalization of krawtchouk polynomials with the weight function defined by @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 are two real parameters .",

    "it is worthwhile to point out that if we take @xmath67 and @xmath68 , the weight function reduces to the one considered in @xcite , where the author derived a discrete system for the recurrence coefficients .",
    "we also observe that the system in @xcite , which was also used in @xcite for the generalized meixner weight , can be obtained from ( [ gen system ] ) with an appropriate choice of the parameters and scaling of @xmath69 and @xmath70 .    since there are two parameters in the weight , the recurrence coefficients are dependent on these parameters as well .",

    "it turns out that , up to mbius transformations , only fifty equations of the form have the painlev property @xcite .",
    "forty - four of these equations can either be linearized , be transformed to a riccati equation or be solved in terms of elliptic functions .",
    "the six remaining equations are now known as the painlev equations , which are often referred to as nonlinear special functions @xcite and have numerous applications in mathematics and mathematical physics .",

    "we study recurrence coefficients numerically .",
    "we conclude this paper with a discussion in section [ sec : dis ] .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th1 ] relies on the ladder operators for discrete orthogonal polynomials , which were studied in @xcite .",
    "we start with a brief description of this aspect .      given a weight function @xmath87",
    ", we define a potential @xmath95 which is a discrete analogue of the external field generated by @xmath87 .",
    "the action of the forward difference operator @xmath96 on orthogonal polynomials @xmath97 is given by @xmath98 in case of a weight @xmath87 on the lattice @xmath12 with @xmath99 , the coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 in ( [ ladder p_n ] ) are given by @xmath102 and @xmath103 in the case of a weight @xmath87 supported on a finite lattice @xmath104 with boundary conditions @xmath99 and @xmath105 , the coefficients @xmath100 and @xmath101 in ( [ ladder p_n ] ) are given by @xmath106 and @xmath107 in both cases , when the lattices are finite or infinite , the following compatibility relations between the functions @xmath108 and @xmath109 hold : @xmath110 @xmath111      to prove theorem [ th1 ] , we follow the theme in @xcite , which made use of the compatibility relations between the ladder operators .",
    "it is readily seen that , with @xmath87 defined in , @xmath99 and @xmath105 . by , we have @xmath112 it then follows from and that @xmath113 where @xmath114 @xmath115 and @xmath116 with @xmath117 and @xmath118 @xmath119 using the orthonormality of the polynomials one immediately gets that @xmath120 since @xmath121lower order terms .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath122 @xmath123 with @xmath124    next we use the compatibility relations ( [ ladder eq1 ] ) and ( [ ladder eq2 ] ) . the first compatibility relation ( [ ladder eq1 ] )",
    "gives rise to the following two equations , after collecting coefficients of equal powers of @xmath125 : @xmath126 @xmath127 from the second compatibility relation we get @xmath128 @xmath129 from ( [ 4.2.5 ] ) we find , using telescopic summation , that @xmath130 equation ( [ 4.2.3 ] ) gives @xmath131 after multiplying ( [ 4.2.4 ] ) by @xmath132 we can replace @xmath133 using ( [ 4.2.2 ] ) , which allows us to take a telescopic sum . as a result",
    "we get @xmath134 one can also replace @xmath135 and @xmath136 in equation ( [ 4.2.4 ] ) using ( [ 4.2.6 ] ) and rewrite the obtained equation by collecting the coefficients of @xmath137 and @xmath138 . taking a telescopic sum and using ( [ 4.2.7 ] ) gives @xmath139 multiplying ( [ 4.2.9 ] ) by @xmath132 , using ( [ 4.2.8 ] ) on the left - hand side and ( [ 4.2.2 ] ) on the right - hand side and eliminating the sum using ( [ 4.2.2 ] ) we finally obtain @xmath140 replacing the sum in equation ( [ 4.2.9 ] ) with the aid of ( [ 4.2.8 ] ) we get @xmath141 setting @xmath142 in the last two equations , we obtain the system .    finally , we note that the initial conditions for the recurrence coefficients , in terms of the moments @xmath143 and @xmath144 , are given by @xmath145 and @xmath146 where @xmath53 is the confluent hypergeometric function @xmath54 .",
    "this , together with and , implies initial conditions for @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ th1 ] .",
    "we use the method proposed in @xcite and system ( [ gen system ] ) to prove theorem [ thm : p5 ] .",
    "we repeat the main steps to be self - contained .",
    "to prove the theorem , we derive the differential equation for @xmath70 . in @xcite",
    "we have used the toda system @xmath147 which also holds in the present case .",
    "solving the first equation ( [ gen system ] ) for @xmath148 and the second equation for @xmath149 and substituting into the toda system ( [ toda ] ) ( where we have replaced @xmath135 and @xmath49 by their expressions in terms of @xmath69 and @xmath70 from theorem  [ th1 ] ) , we get two equations @xmath150 and @xmath151 where the differentiation is with respect to @xmath45 . by differentiating equation ( [ * ] ) and substituting the expression for @xmath152",
    "we obtain an equation for @xmath153 as a function of @xmath154 : @xmath155    eliminating @xmath69 between this equation and ( [ * ] ) gives a nonlinear second order second degree equation for @xmath70 : @xmath156 we have used ` mathematica ` to compute this long expression .",
    "it can be checked by direct computations , that applying a transformation @xmath157 this equation simplifies considerably and can be written as @xmath158 where @xmath159 and @xmath160 the last equation appears in @xcite ( equation ( a.8 ) ) and is known to be related to the fifth painlev equation .",
    "this is similar to the case of generalized meixner polynomials ( see @xcite ) .    by taking @xmath74 in a form",
    "as shown in , we get the fifth painlev equation p@xmath79   with parameters .",
    "a similar approach can be used to obtain a ( second order second degree ) differential equation for @xmath69 . to get the expression for @xmath161 in terms of the solutions of the fifth painlev equation we use , substitute and find @xmath161 by solving a quadratic equation .",
    "one can check with ` mathematica ` that one of the roots of this equation , i.e. , indeed gives the statement of theorem [ thm : p5 ] .",
    "this completes the proof of theorem [ thm : p5 ] .",
    "note that we can derive a nonlinear discrete second order equation for @xmath74 .",
    "from the first equation of ( [ gen system ] ) with @xmath162 and the second equation with @xmath163 we eliminate @xmath148 by computing the resultant . the obtained equation and the second equation of ( [ gen system ] ) with @xmath162",
    "then allow us to eliminate @xmath69 . as a result",
    ", we obtain a nonlinear discrete equation for @xmath74 which we denote by @xmath164 the equation was again obtained by using ` mathematica ` but it is too long and too complicated to include here explicitly .",
    "similarly , a nonlinear discrete equation for @xmath161 can be obtained : @xmath165 one can , similarly to ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) , check that the functions @xmath149 , @xmath166 and @xmath167 in are connected by using the bcklund transformation of the fifth painlev equation ( * ? ?",
    "* @xmath93 32.7 ( v ) ) .",
    "in particular , one can express all of them using only @xmath168 and @xmath169 ( the solution of p@xmath79  with parameters ) .",
    "when these expressions are substituted into , it becomes identically zero .",
    "moreover , equation can essentially ( up to a factor depending on @xmath70 ) be obtained by eliminating @xmath168 between @xmath170 and @xmath171 where @xmath172",
    "the system ( [ gen system ] ) , together with the definitions ( [ def : x_n ] ) and ( [ def : y_n ] ) , can be used to compute the recurrence coefficients starting with the initial values @xmath173 and @xmath57 given in ( [ eq : initial value xy ] ) .",
    "figures 1 - 3 show these coefficients for @xmath174 and for some different choices of the parameters @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "recall that the recurrence coefficients ( [ krawrec ] ) for the krawtchouk polynomials are such that @xmath135 is quadratic in @xmath162 , with @xmath41 , and that @xmath49 is of degree 1 in @xmath162 . also recall that when @xmath45 and @xmath46 tend to infinity and @xmath177 we recover the krawtchouk weight .",
    "figure  [ fig:4 ] shows this observation . for the generalized krawtchouk polynomials the @xmath135 are first increasing until they reach their maximum , and then decreasing , with @xmath41 .",
    "the @xmath49 are no longer linear but change from concave to convex . the point where @xmath135 reaches its maximum and the inflection point for the @xmath49 depend on the parameter @xmath45",
    ", these two points do not coincide .",
    "moreover , for @xmath58 values close to @xmath178 , the @xmath49 change once more to concave , as can be seen ( albeit not very clearly ) in figure  [ fig:2 ] .    to get these values ( they were obtained using ` maple ` ) , one has to work with quite high accuracy , for it turns out that even a very small perturbation ( @xmath179 for @xmath174 ) in the initial value @xmath57 quickly leads to very bad results .",
    "an explanation for this behaviour is the following : the system ( [ gen system ] ) allows to compute the @xmath69 , from which the coefficients @xmath135 can be obtained by ( [ def : x_n ] ) .",
    "there is , however , no a priori reason why these @xmath135 should be positive and @xmath180 .",
    "this is not a new observation : in @xcite ( section 6.5 , about discrete @xmath181-hermite i polynomials ) it was conjectured that the initial value needed to obtain the recurrence coefficients for these polynomials , is the only real value which leads to positive values for @xmath135 for every @xmath182 . since in this generalized krawtchouk case",
    "there is only a finite number of coefficients ( @xmath183 ) which need to be positive , this conjecture obviously does not hold here , but we conjecture that there is only one initial value @xmath57 for which @xmath180 and the @xmath183 are positive .",
    "an alternative , and numerically more stable way , would be to use a fixed point algorithm for which the fixed point satisfies ( [ gen system ] ) .    following a referee s remark",
    ", we also used the stieltjes approach to calculate the recurrence coefficients , see e.g. @xcite . in this method ,",
    "one uses ( [ recu : orthonormal ] ) to calculate @xmath48 and @xmath49 from @xmath184 and @xmath185 .",
    "then ( [ 3 term orthonormal ] ) can be used to obtain @xmath186 , which after normalization gives @xmath187 .",
    "the initial values needed are @xmath6 and @xmath188 .",
    "numerical calculations show that this method needs less precision in the initial conditions but requires more computations .",
    "in this paper we have been dealing with the recurrence coefficients of the discrete orthogonal polynomials , namely the generalized krawtchouk polynomials , and have shown that they are related to the classical solutions ( in terms of confluent hypergeometric functions ) of the fifth painlev equation .",
    "a possible further direction is to consider more factors in and find out whether the sixth painlev equation or some equation from the painlev hierarchy is related to the recurrence coefficients of such a weight .",
    "a reason that leads to this conjecture follows from the observation that the initial conditions for such a weight correspond to special solutions of the sixth painlev equation .",
