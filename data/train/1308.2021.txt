    "the uniform , or homogeneous , electron gas ( ueg ) , also known as jellium or as a one component plasma , is a well - studied system in physics .",
    "it is important as a proving ground for method development .",
    "accurate results provide a better understanding of the rich underlying physics of classical and quantum coulomb correlations , as well as provide a basis for approximations in more complicated real systems . one important case of note is density functional theory at zero temperature , in which local density approximations ( lda ) using the ueg results for the exchange and correlation ( xc ) energy have proved remarkably successful in systems as diverse as molecules to exotic phases of highly compressed matter .",
    "a challenge in current research is simulations of warm dense matter ( wdm ) , motivating pursuit of accurate finite temperature ueg results for the corresponding development of temperature dependent functionals .",
    "the zero temperature ueg was the subject of much theoretical development in 60 s and 70 s of the last century .",
    "rpa and beyond rpa dielectric approximations were particularly successful lindhard , gell - mannbrueckner , stls , vs in appropriate limits . however in 1980",
    "ceperley and alder @xcite produced benchmark quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) results with nearly exact accuracy across a wide range of densities , though the fixed - node approximation does lead to small errors in the results for high densities .",
    "these accurate values for the ueg xc energy provided the essential lda needed for designing functionals beyond lda @xcite .",
    "almost all subsequent zero temperature dft formulations make use of this lda obtained from the ueg simulation in some explicit way .",
    "the corresponding lda for development of finite temperature dft , firmly based in the finite temperature ueg , has been lacking up until now .",
    "there has been much less development for the finite temperature ueg , in part due to lack of experimental motivation .",
    "now , experimental conditions of wdm span the range from zero temperature to far above the fermi temperature . until very recently @xcite",
    "there has not been any qmc type simulations in this range to extend those of ceperley and alder at zero temperature .",
    "rpa calculations were done originally by gupta and rajagopal @xcite , and later revised and fits provided by perrot and dharma - wardana @xcite . shortly after , beyond rpa calculations",
    "were done including static @xcite and dynamic schwengbohm local field corrections . a finite temperature vashista - singwi type calculation ( vs )",
    "was done using an approximate form for the local field corrections @xcite .",
    "in addition other methods have been proposed including the so - called modified convolution approximation tanakaichimarumca and interpolation approximations @xcite .",
    "most recently , methods of mapping the quantum problem to a corresponding classical system have been proposed @xcite , where effective classical strong coupling methods such as molecular dynamics simulation and liquid state theory can be applied @xcite .",
    "further details of some of these theories are given in the results and comparisons sections .",
    "two thermodynamic parameters are required to describe the equilibrium ueg , chosen here to be the density @xmath0 and temperature @xmath1 . when measured relative to the fermi temperature , the dimensionless temperature is@xmath2where @xmath3 is the fermi energy , and @xmath4 is the fermi wave vector .",
    "the density is typically specified in terms of the electron wigner - seitz length @xmath5 when measured relative to the bohr radius @xmath6 its dimensionless form is@xmath7dimensionless thermodynamic properties therefore can be expressed as functions of @xmath8 .",
    "the importance of coulomb coupling is measured by a coupling constant defined as the ratio of the coulomb energy for a pair at the distance @xmath9 relative to the kinetic energy per particle . in the classical limit",
    "the appropriate kinetic energy is @xmath10 and the classical coupling constant is @xmath11it is related to @xmath12 by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 . at very low temperatures",
    "the relevant kinetic energy is @xmath15 and the corresponding coupling constant at @xmath16 is a function of @xmath17 only .",
    "as previously noted the @xmath16 limit has seen much development culminating in high accuracy ab initio simulations .",
    "this has also been the case for the classical limit @xmath18 @xcite . the theoretical development in the intermediate fermi - degeneracy region mentioned above has not been benchmarked so that the relative accuracy of the various methods is unknown . the objective here is to present a improvement of the finite temperature vashista - singwi model by including a consistency requirement on the dielectric function and the pressure derived from it ( the exact compressibility sum rule for the small wave vector limit of the dielectric function ) .",
    "the temperature dependence of the structure ( pair correlation function ) and thermodynamics ( free energy , compressibility ) are calculated from this improved vashista - singwi approximation ( vsa ) in the range @xmath19 for a wide range of @xmath20 corresponding to wdm conditions .",
    "the approach of the free energy to the classical limit is explored also at much higher temperatures .",
    "comparisons with several other theoretical models and the new qmc simulation results are also given .",
    "in this way , some assessment of the quality and trends of the results is established .",
    "we calculate the ueg at finite temperature by means of an approximate dielectric function of the form @xmath21where @xmath22 is the coulomb potential and @xmath23 is the finite temperature polarizability of the non - interacting ueg , and @xmath24 is the static local field correction ( lfc ) . for simplicity of notation ,",
    "the dependence of these functions on @xmath12 is not made explicit except where needed for clarity or emphasis .",
    "the static structure factor is found by the fluctuation - dissipation theorem as a sum over the matsubara frequencies for the polarizabilities of the interacting system @xcite as @xmath25v_{q}\\chi _ { 0}(\\mathbf{q},z_{l } ) }   \\label{eq : sq}\\end{aligned}\\]]where @xmath26 and in the second line we have made the static lfc approximation consistent with eq .",

    "was taken as a constant equal to @xmath32 for the zero temperature ueg .",
