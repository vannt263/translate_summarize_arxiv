    "a nonlinear medium submitted to wave irradiation at a frequency in a forbidden band gap can undergo bistable behavior and present hysteresis properties .",
    "this bistability has attracted much attention , e.g. in nonlinear optics as a means for a medium to switch from total reflection to partial ( sometimes total ) transmission @xcite , or in superconducting junction devices as a means to conceive amplifiers that _ `` remain efficient in the quantum limit '' _ @xcite .",
    "we attempt to give here a comprehensive interpretation of this phenomenon in terms of both analytical description and numerical simulations , in order to unveil a particular stationary regime presenting a non - zero output for vanishing input , what we call the _ ideal switch _ and which allows for detection of ( almost ) vanishing signal .    to that end",
    "we consider the sine - gordon equation on the finite interval @xmath0 $ ] @xmath1 associated to the boundary value problem @xmath2 on a vanishing initial state ( with @xmath3 and @xmath4 for compatibility of the initial and boundary values ) .",
    "this is a quite standard problem in physics of a wave equation with a forced extremity ( dirichlet boundary condition in @xmath5 ) and a free end ( neumann boundary condition in @xmath6 ) , associated to cauchy initial data at @xmath7 .",
    "a related physical situation is for instance a long josephson junction @xcite or an array of coupled short junctions ( josephson superlattice ) @xcite .",
    "note that , depending on the used external driving , the boundary has possibly to be replaced with @xmath8 .",
    "an important subclass of boundary @xmath9 is constant amplitude periodic driving at a frequency in the natural band gap of the system , namely @xmath10 after a convenient transient sequence where @xmath9 grows from a vanishing amplitude to the value @xmath11 to avoid initial shock .",
    "while for a linear system this boundary excitation does not flow through , nonlinearity allows for energy transmission above the threshold amplitude which reads ( in the semi - infinite case @xmath12 ) @xmath13 this is called _ nonlinear supratransmission _ @xcite and happens by emission of solitons ( moving breathers ) that propagate in the nonlinear medium .",
    "this process , quite generic , has been experimentally realized on a chain of coupled pendula @xcite , and applies for instance in discrete systems of coupled waveguide arrays @xcite where the forbidden gap results from discreteness , or else in bragg media ( periodic dielectric structures ) under constant micro - wave irradiation in the photonic band gap @xcite . in josephson junctions arrays ,",
    "submitted to microwave excitation , the boundary @xmath14 induces the threshold @xmath15 @xcite .    in the finite line case considered here ,",
    "we shall again find a nonlinear supratransmission threshold which tends to the value for large @xmath16 .",
    "but a property far less understood is the hysteresis loop obtained by decreasing the amplitude excitation @xmath11 from the threshold @xmath17 .",
    "this property has been for instance observed on numerical simulations @xcite in the context of josephson superlattices , but both the analytical expression of the threshold and the very nonlinear mechanism involved have not been clarified .",
    "we shall establish a general procedure to determine the threshold by studying the standing periodic solutions of sine - gordon which _ synchronize _ to the driving frequency @xmath18 and _ adapts _ to the driving amplitude @xmath11 .",
    "although these two conditions are sufficient to determine _ completely _ the solution , it is not _",
    "uniquely _ defined .",
    "indeed we shall prove that a fixed set of physical parameters @xmath19 may be related to more than one solution .",
    "this is the principle that leads to bistability when @xmath20 .    as an interesting consequence",
    "we obtain that there exists a regime where a vanishing input amplitude @xmath11 produces a non - vanishing output amplitude .",
    "this process shows that sine - gordon can be thought of as an _ ideal switch _ along the hysteresis loop from zero to zero input amplitudes .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in the next section we display the set of explicit solutions to sine - gordon on a length @xmath16 submitted to the only requirements that the input boundary amplitude be @xmath11 and the period of the solution be @xmath21 .",
    "the following section is devoted to the analytical definition and evaluation of the threshold of bistability .",
    "then we show by numerical simulations in section 4 that those explicit solution are indeed produced by the boundary driving and we check bistability predictions . in particular we compute , for a more realistic damped sine - gordon model , the power released by the boundary driver to the medium and find that after having switched , this power is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude larger than before the switch .",
    "under boundary condition , in order to describe the periodic asymptotic regime reached in numerical simulations , we follow @xcite and seek a solution @xmath22.\\ ] ] the boundary condition in @xmath23 then reads @xmath24 where we have defined the amplitude parameter @xmath25 such as to scale @xmath26 to unity , in other words @xmath27 by inserting expression in the sine - gordon equation and by use of constraints and , we obtain differential equations with a unique free parameter @xmath28 : @xmath29 where prime denotes differentiation and where @xmath30 thanks to and the equation for @xmath31 is integrated on @xmath32 $ ] and the one for @xmath26 on @xmath33 $ ] .",
    "the solution is then completely defined ( in terms of elliptic integrals ) by the values of the two parameters @xmath25 and @xmath28 , determined as follows .    our first fundamental hypothesis is to assume , accordingly with numerical simulations , that the solution _ synchronizes _ to the boundary driving , namely that the function @xmath26 is periodic with the period of the driver : @xmath34 the second fundamental hypothesis consists in expressing that the solution _ adapts _ to the driving amplitude @xmath35 , which gives @xmath36 the two relations and constitute a closed system of equations for the two unknowns @xmath25 and @xmath28 in terms of the physical constants @xmath37 , @xmath18 and @xmath16 .",
    "the point is that bistability occurs because the solution of drastically depends on the sign of @xmath28 .",
    "we shall indeed discover that there may exist different solutions that do synchronize to @xmath18 and adapts to @xmath37 .",
    "in other words , for any fixed @xmath18 and @xmath16 , a given input amplitude @xmath37 may correspond to more than one value of the output amplitude @xmath25 as depicted on fig.[fig : bifurcation ] .",
    "we call _ type i solutions _ those obtained for @xmath38 ( implying @xmath39 ) for which we obtain @xcite @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the cosine - amplitude jacobi elliptic function of modulus @xmath42 . according to @xcite , the resulting solution @xmath43 is called _ plasma oscillation _ and we have from @xmath44 this relation between the nonlinear wave parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46",
    "is often called a _ nonlinear dispersion relation _ but we shall reserve such a denomination to the true dispersion relation which relates the actual period @xmath47 of @xmath31 to the period @xmath48 of @xmath26 .    the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath25 are now determined by requiring synchronization and input datum , namely here by solving for unknowns @xmath28 and @xmath25 the system @xmath49 ( note : the complete elliptic integral @xmath50 is well defined as for @xmath51 we have @xmath52 . )    it is useful to express the above solution in terms of the two wave parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "this is done by using to eliminate @xmath25 and @xmath28 from the definitions of @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we get @xmath55 system appears then as an equation for the determination of the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the data of the length @xmath16 , the boundary driver s frequency @xmath18 and amplitude @xmath37 .",
    "new types of solutions are obtained for @xmath56 for which the evolution of @xmath26 requires @xmath57 in order to guarantee the constraint .",
    "defining then @xmath58 the basic equations and become @xmath59 it appears that the constraint which states that @xmath60 , requires @xmath61 , namely @xmath62 a condition that must be checked a posteriori when computing @xmath63 from the synchronization constraint .",
    "the structure of the equation implies two classes of solutions depending on the relative values of @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "type ii solutions are obtained for @xmath66 which , together with constraint , reads @xmath67 the solution of can now be obtained as @xmath68 and we have the relation @xmath69 between the wave parameters @xmath46 and @xmath45 for type ii solution .",
    "the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath25 are determined as before by requiring synchronization and input datum , namely @xmath70 although the above equation , for real valued parameters , has two sets of solutions @xmath71 , only one set verifies the constraint @xmath66 .    as before",
    ", we express the type ii solution in terms of the wave parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 , by means of to eliminate @xmath25 and @xmath63 in @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we obtain @xmath72 system determines then the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the data of @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath37 .",
    "the type iii solution is obtained still for @xmath56 when @xmath73 .",
    "such can be realized only in the case @xmath74 by requiring @xmath75 the solution of now reads @xmath76 and the wave parameters obey @xmath77 the synchronization condition and input datum furnish here the system @xmath78 for the unknowns parameters @xmath63 and @xmath25 .",
    "the same remark as for the type ii solution holds here , namely that the system has two sets of solutions @xmath71 but only one verifies the constraint @xmath73 .",
    "again the type iii solution can be expressed entirely in terms of the two parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 by means of which gives @xmath79 then is a system for the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 in terms of the data @xmath16 , @xmath18 and @xmath37 .",
    "the above 3 solutions are now used to describe analytically bistability properties of sine - gordon .",
    "the first step is to define and calculate , at given length @xmath16 , the threshold @xmath80 as functions of the driving frequency @xmath18 .",
    "last , decreasing the input amplitude from @xmath80 , once a transmission regime has been reached , the system locks to the type - i solution which holds down to a vanishing driving amplitude .",
    "this is a property that makes sine - gordon as the _ ideal switch _ and allows to understand how it can be used to amplify weak ( vanishing ) signals .",
    "as shown by figure [ fig : bifurcation ] , increasing the input amplitude from @xmath81 generates the type iii solution .",
    "this solution has a maximum input value @xmath80 resulting from as the point where @xmath82 reaches its minimum value @xmath83 , namely @xmath84 such a definition of the threshold @xmath80 is more conveniently written in terms of @xmath45 and @xmath46 through as @xmath85 in this equation , the parameters @xmath45 and @xmath46 are determined through , which , at the threshold , can also be written as the system @xmath86 with @xmath54 and @xmath53 given by .",
    "the figure [ fig : thresholds ] shows that the threshold @xmath80 is quite close to the expression of @xmath87 in .",
    "this property is demonstrated in general by studying the limit @xmath12 in the type iii solution . at threshold amplitude ,",
    "the relation between @xmath16 and @xmath53 gives the necessary condition @xmath88 with which the synchronization condition provides @xmath89 with this in hands , the expression of the threshold readily gives the expression , namely @xmath90    _ remark : _ it is instructive to compute also the limit @xmath12 on the solution itself at the threshold where from and obviously @xmath91 . in that case",
    "we rewrite the solution @xmath31 of as @xmath92 expand the denominator , take the limit @xmath12 first and make then @xmath93 .",
    "we obtain @xmath31 of as @xmath94 the same procedure applied to @xmath26 in , with @xmath95 , provides @xmath96    and the resulting solution @xmath43 of sine - gordon on the semi - line is the stationnary breather centered in @xmath5 accordingly with @xcite .      considering the type i solution , expression that links the input @xmath37 to the output @xmath25 can produce @xmath81 with @xmath97 , such as to generate a regime of non - vanishing output value with a vanishing input amplitude , the _ ideal switching _ regime .",
    "this is the case when @xmath98 where @xmath25 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are related to @xmath45 and @xmath46 through .",
    "note the formal analogy with where the parameters @xmath25 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 are different .",
    "this is a system of equations for @xmath99 whose solution then produces the seeked output amplitude by @xmath100 defined by in terms of the physical entries @xmath16 and @xmath18 .",
    "we have plotted in fig.[fig : switch ] the output amplitude @xmath101 in the ideal switching case ( @xmath81 ) as a function of @xmath18 for length @xmath102 .",
    "we observe that , for a given length , there exists a threshold in frequency below which no ideal switching is allowed .",
    "this is understood by observing that @xmath64 diverges when @xmath103 , for which @xmath104 ( a limit threshold that has exactly the same origin as in when @xmath12 ) .",
    "conversely , at given driver frequency @xmath18 , there exists a minimum length @xmath16 of the medium to obtain an ideal switch , it is displayed on fig .",
    "[ fig : switch - l ] .",
    "let us remark that the notion of _ nonlinear dispersion relation _ is not useful to predict , at given driving frequency @xmath18 , the minimum driver amplitude that generates transmission , as indeed we have here an example where this minimum is simply vanishing .",
    "bistable properties , and in particular ideal switching , have been analytically described in the integrable case .",
    "however , any realistic physical situation must take into account the damping inherent to the medium .",
    "the simplest way to include damping is to assume the model @xmath105 associated with the initial - boundary value problem in the particular subclass .",
    "we study here the bistable properties of by numerical simulations and compare the results to the analytical predictions .",
    "to that end the system is driven at the input boundary @xmath5 with a bandgap frequency and time dependent amplitude as follows : in a first numerical simulation , the amplitude is smoothly increased up to the value @xmath11 smaller than the supratransmission threshold @xmath17 . in a second simulation , the amplitude is increased up to a value exceeding the supratransmission threshold and then , after a time sufficient to generate moving breathers , it is decreased to the same value @xmath11 as in the first case . the figure [ fig : driving ] displays the two time variations of the driving amplitude that we have used in the numerical simulations . after having reached a stationary regime ,",
    "although the driving amplitudes @xmath11 are equal in both cases , the dynamics drastically differ in those two cases as it is expected from the analytical consideration presented above and described hereafter .      in most of our numerical simulations",
    "we choose the driving frequency in the middle of the band gap @xmath106 , use damping parameter @xmath107 and length @xmath108 . for the driving amplitude along path 1 in fig.[fig : driving ]",
    ", we always observe a stationary regime with decaying profile of the standing wave , very well described by the exact analytical solution of type iii ( [ t - iii])([x - iii ] ) . instead , when driving along path 2 , we get the picture corresponding to the exact type i solution ( [ t - i])([x - i ] ) .",
    "those two drastically different behaviors of the system are displayed as three dimensional plots in fig.[fig : surf ] .",
    "it is remarkable on the second picture of fig.[fig : surf ] that the system has locked to a stationary solution with a small driving amplitude ( here @xmath109 ) and a large output amplitude ( evaluated at @xmath110 ) .",
    "let us mention that we can drive the system with amplitudes down to @xmath111 and still have the type i solution ( large output amplitude ) despite presence of damping in the system , getting thus a regime of almost ideal switch , or almost perfect detector .",
    "another remark is that the system never locks to the exact solution of type ii ( [ t - ii])([x - ii ] ) , simply because this solution is unstable .",
    "for instance , if that exact solution is used as an initial condition in sine - gordon , it eventually breaks down .    to be complete ,",
    "we compare the analytical expressions of the standing waves profiles of , and to the results of numerical simulations in the case of the two different driving paths in the context of fig.[fig : surf ] .",
    "the result is displayed in figure [ fig : analnumer ] where the obtained perfect matching shows that indeed the system locks to the analytical solution obtained by assuming frequency synchronization and amplitude matching .",
    "this is completed by plotting in fig.[fig : fit ] the input - output amplitude dependence obtained from numerical simulations and its comparison with analytical curves derived from formulas , and .",
    "the physically useful bistable nature of the system manifests in large difference between the energy dissipation in the two stationary regimes . the averaged energy released from the driver in unit time ,",
    "can be expressed as @xmath112 indeed one can easily obtain @xmath113 which by averaging on one period furnishes as the boundary value in @xmath5 is periodic .",
    "although the analytical solution of the sine - gordon equation are not solutions of the damped version , we may compare the power defined above obtained by numerical simulations of to the expression where @xmath114 is simply replaced by the exact solution ( type iii before the switch , type i after ) .",
    "the result of this comparison is displayed in fig.[fig : lin - log ] wher we see that expression with analytical solutions fit strikingly well the numerical simulations , and that the power @xmath115 after the switch is two to three orders of magnitude greater than before the switch .",
    "it is worth mentioning that while the analytical solution of type i holds for any length @xmath16 , in a realistic physical system ( nonzero damping ) , the situation is different . in particular , for large l and low driving amplitudes , when several nodes of type i standing wave solution are present , the solution can not survive and decays to type iii solution .",
    "this is understood by the following simple argument : all of the exact solutions derived in the previous sections are standing waves , i.e. they do not generate energy flux .",
    "thus , regions of the system far from the boundary can not gain energy from the driver and the oscillations will eventually fade away .",
    "we have essentially demonstrated , both by analytical and numerical treatment , that the bistable property on the sine - gordon system allows to generate a particular regime that works as an ideal switch : nonzero output for vanishing input . in a realistic physical system ( including damping ) the property is conserved but for small ( non - vanishing ) input .",
    "this nonlinear hysteretis has been shown to correspond to quite determinant differences in the power released by the driver to the system .",
