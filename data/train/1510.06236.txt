    "stationary newtonian hydrodynamic configurations  axially symmetric and selfgravitating  that rotate around a fixed axis , possess two pecularities .",
    "this is a free - boundary problem  its domain has to be found simultaneously with the solution itself .",
    "in addition , the problem is undetermined  traditionally one fixes it by ( almost ) freely prescribing the so - called rotation curve , the angular velocities @xmath0 of the particles of a fluid .",
    "there exists an integrability condition  that @xmath0 and the angular momentum per unit mass @xmath1 can be functions of a single variable @xmath2 , where @xmath2 is the distance from the rotation axis . the additional `` stability '' restriction @xmath3 of ref .   constrains freedom to choose the angular velocity rather weakly .",
    "general - relativistic counterparts of these systems are also undetermined , but the way to specify the system is through prescribing the function @xmath4  the angular momentum as a function of the angular velocity .",
    "this condition can be rephrased in principle in terms of geometric coordinates , but only through solving a nonlinear equation that defines the linear velocity .",
    "this vague remark shall be explained later ; we want only to say that it is nontrivial to find an admissible form of @xmath4 .",
    "the only known rotation law in general - relativistic hydrodynamics had been for a long time that propoposed by bardeen and wagoner @xcite , with @xmath1 being a linear function of the angular velocity .",
    "galeazzi , yoshida and eriguchi @xcite have found recently a nonlinear angular velocity profile .",
    "none of these tends in the newtonian limit into the newtonian monomial rotation curves @xmath5 . in this talk",
    "we shall introduce general - relativistic rotation curves @xmath6 that in the nonrelativistic limit exactly coincide with @xmath5 ( @xmath7 ; @xmath8 and @xmath9 are constants ) .",
    "they comprise , in particular , the general - relativistic keplerian rotation law that possesses the first post - newtonian limit ( 1pn ) .",
    "the well known keplerian massless disk of dust satisfies our rotation law exactly in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "we shall consider fluids with the polytropic equation of state @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the specific entropy of fluid .",
    "then one has specific enthalpy @xmath12 .",
    "the entropy is assumed to be constant .",
    "the euler equations read @xmath13    one easily notices that this system of equations , supplemented by the poisson equation @xmath14 , is closed only if @xmath0 is known .",
    "differentiation of the two equations in ( [ en ] ) with respect to @xmath15 and @xmath2 , respectively , and subtraction of the results yields @xmath16 .",
    "the angular velocity depends only on @xmath2 , the distance from a rotation axis : @xmath17 .",
    "this constitutes the integrability condition .",
    "we assume the axially symmetric _ stationary _ metric @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the rescaled time coordinate ( @xmath20 is the speed of light in vacuum ) , and @xmath2 , @xmath15 , @xmath21 are cylindrical coordinates . the metric potentials",
    "@xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 depend on @xmath2 and @xmath15 only .",
    "the einstein equations , with the signature of the metric @xmath26 , read @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the stress - momentum tensor .",
    "we take the stress - momentum tensor @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the baryonic rest - mass density , @xmath31 is the specific enthalpy , and @xmath32 is the pressure .",
    "the 4-velocity @xmath33 is normalized , @xmath34 .",
    "the coordinate ( angular ) velocity reads @xmath35 , where @xmath36 .",
    "define the linear velocity with respect to the locally nonrotating system of reference @xmath37 the potentials @xmath25 , @xmath23 , @xmath22 , and @xmath24 satisfy equations that have been found by komatsu , eriguchi and hachisu @xcite . here",
    "we recall a version similar to that used in ref . .",
    "the relevant equations read @xmath38   + \\frac{1}{2 c^4 } r^2 e^{2(\\beta - \\nu)/c^2 } \\nabla \\omega \\cdot \\nabla \\omega \\nonumber \\\\ & & - \\frac{1}{c^2 } \\nabla ( \\beta + \\nu ) \\cdot \\nabla \\nu   \\nonumber\\\\ \\left ( \\delta + \\frac{2}{r } \\partial_r \\right ) \\omega   & = & - 16 \\pi \\frac{g}{c^2 } e^{2",
    "\\alpha / c^2 } \\rho ( c^2 + h ) \\frac{\\omega - \\omega / c^2}{1 - v^2/c^2 }    + \\frac{1}{c^2 } \\nabla ( \\nu - 3 \\beta ) \\cdot \\nabla \\omega,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 denotes the `` flat '' gradient operator .",
    "they constitute an overdetermined , but consistent , set of equations .",
    "we omit the remaining einstein equations , since they yield corrections of higher orders .",
    "the general - relativistic euler equations are integrable assuming that the angular momentum per unit mass , @xmath40 depends only on the angular velocity @xmath41 ; @xmath42 . for a given @xmath4",
    ", one can insert eq .",
    "( [ v ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ j ] ) and find explicit dependence of the angular velocity on spatial coordinates .",
    "it is clear , that this depends crucially on the form of @xmath4 .",
    "assuming @xmath42 one gets a general - relativistic integro - algebraic bernoulli equation , that embodies the hydrodynamic information carried by the continuity equations @xmath43 and the baryonic mass conservation @xmath44 .",
    "it is given by @xmath45",
    "the general - relativistic rotation law employed in the literature refs .  ,  , has the form @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are parameters . in the newtonian limit and large @xmath47",
    "one arrives at the rigid rotation , @xmath49 , while for small @xmath47 one gets the constant angular momentum per unit mass .",
    "a three - parameter expression for @xmath1 is proposed in ref .  .",
    "none of these rotation curves give in the newtonian limit the monomial ones .",
    "two of us have found recently a new family of rotation laws @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 are parameters .",
    "it is notable that a massless disk made of dust rotating in keplerian motion is an exact solution in the schwarzschild spacetime .",
    "the general - relativistic bernoulli equation acquires a simple algebraic form @xcite , if @xmath54 : @xmath55    the seemingly singular case @xmath56 , that corresponds to the constant linear velocity , is also described by the present formalism ; one should take a limit @xmath57 in eq .",
    "( [ momentum ] ) and some of forthcoming formulae ( ref . ) .",
    "rotation curves @xmath58 ought to be recovered from the equation @xmath59    in the newtonian limit  the zeroth order of the post - newtonian expansion ( 0pn )  one arrives at @xmath60 .",
    "the stability requirement of ref . imposes the condition @xmath61 .",
    "these two constants , @xmath51 and @xmath62 , can be given apriori .",
    "let us remark at this point that the rotation law ( [ momentum ] ) , and consequently the newtonian rotation @xmath60 , applies primarily to single rotating toroids and toroids rotating around black holes . in the case of rotating stars one would have to construct a special differentially rotating law , with the aim to avoid singularity at the rotation axis .",
    "the two limiting cases @xmath63 and @xmath64 correspond to the constant angular momentum per unit mass ( @xmath65 ) and the rigid rotation ( @xmath66 ) , respectively .",
    "the keplerian rotation is given by @xmath67 and @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is a mass ( ref . ) .",
    "the 1pn approximation corresponds to the choice of metric exponents @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "define @xmath72 ; it appears that @xmath73 satisfies @xmath74    the spatial part of the metric @xmath75 is conformally flat .",
    "notice that in the newtonian gauge imposed in ( [ metric1 ] ) the geometric distance to the rotation axis is given by @xmath76 .",
    "the relevant post - newtonian approximation has been discussed in ref .",
    "; we shall extract from therein information on the general - relativistic corrections to the angular velocity .",
    "the angular velocity , up to the terms @xmath77 is given by @xmath78 this expression can be reduced to @xmath79 , in the case of test fluids , at the symmetry plane @xmath80 . for the massless dust , in the schwarzschild geometry , we get @xmath81 .",
    "the first term in ( [ angular velocityc2 ] ) is simply the newtonian rotation law rewritten as a function of the geometric distance from the rotation axis .",
    "the second term ( denoted as @xmath82 in fig.1 ) vanishes at the plane of symmetry , @xmath80 , for circular keplerian motion of test fluids in the monopole potential @xmath83 .",
    "it is sensitive both to the contribution of the disk self - gravity at the plane @xmath80 and the deviation from the strictly keplerian motion .",
    "the third term ( @xmath84 in figs 1 and 2 ) is responsible for the geometric frame dragging . the last term ( @xmath85 in fig .",
    "1 ) represents the recently discovered anti - dragging effect ; it agrees ( for the monomial angular velocities @xmath86 )  with the result obtained earlier in ref . .",
    "in the following discussion we assume @xmath87 , which means @xmath88 , but the reasoning is symmetric under the parity operation @xmath89 .",
    "the specific enthalpy @xmath90 is nonnegative , thence @xmath91 is nonpositive  the discovered in ref .",
    "instantaneous 1pn dynamic reaction slows the motion : it `` anti - draggs '' a system .",
    "in contrast to that , the well known geometric term with @xmath92 is positive @xcite , and the contribution @xmath93 to the angular velocity is positive  it pushes a rotating fluid body forward .",
    "thus the last two terms in ( [ angular velocityc2 ] ) counteract .",
    "the specific enthalpy @xmath94 vanishes for dust , hence dust test bodies are exposed only to the frame dragging . for the rigid ( uniform ) rotation",
    "the correction terms are proportional to @xmath95 and they vanish , because @xmath96 .",
    "figure 1 displays contributions of each of the particular effects at the symmetry plane @xmath80 of the disk ; notice that the anti - dragging can prevail the geometric dragging .",
    "figure 2 in turn demonstrates that the sum of all three contributing effects can be much larger than the geometric counterpart .",
    ".,width=297 ]    .",
    "here @xmath97 , width=297 ]",
    "we present general - relativistic rotation laws and derive a full form of the new weak - fields effects , including the recent dynamic anti - dragging effect of ref . .",
    "the latter can be robust according to the numerics of ref .   ,",
    "but the ultimate conclusion requires a fully general - relativistic treatment with the new rotation laws .",
    "it is conjectured that in some active galactic nuclei @xcite the frame dragging can manifest through the bardeen - petterson effect @xcite .",
    "the two other effects may lead to its observable modifications in black hole systems with heavy disks . in the weak field approximation the angular velocity of toroids depends primarily on the distance from the rotation axis",
    " as in the newtonian hydrodynamics  but the weak fields contributions can make the rotation curve dependent on the height above the symmetry plane of rotation .",
    "the new rotation laws would allow the investigation of self - gravitating fluid bodies in the regime of strong gravity for general - relativistic versions of newtonian rotation curves .",
    "in particular , they can be used in order to describe stationary heavy disks in tight accretion systems with central black holes , for instance in products of the merger of compact binaries ( pairs of black holes and neutron stars ) ( refs .   and ) , but they might exist also in some active galactic nuclei .    these rotation laws can be applied to the study of various open problems in the post - newtonian perturbation scheme of general - relativistic hydrodynamics  the investigation of convergence of the post - newtonian pertubation scheme , as well as the existence of the newtonian and post - newtonian limits of solutions . they can be used to test the accuracy of recent inequalities relating the angular momentum , the mass and area of black holes @xcite .",
