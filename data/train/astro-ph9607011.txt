    "ever since the reports of the detection of two cosmic ray showers of energy well above @xmath3 ev  @xcite the origin and the nature of such events have been subjects of strong interest and intense discussion .",
    "it is not only very difficult  @xcite to extend our understanding of particle acceleration to such extraordinarily high energies but the propagation of these particles in the microwave background and possibly other universal radiation fields restricts the distance to their potential sources to several tens of mpc .    conservatively minded astrophysicists are looking for astrophysical sources which may contain the environment necessary for stochastic particle acceleration to energies in excess of @xmath3 ev .",
    "powerful ( frii ) radio galaxies  @xcite have been suggested as possible sources .",
    "if this suggestion were true , the highest energy cosmic rays ( hecr ) would be most likely protons , reflecting the composition of the matter that is available for injection in the termination shocks of frii jets . others  @xcite search for powerful astrophysical sources in the cosmologically nearby universe .",
    "hecr then could also be heavier nuclei , for which the acceleration is less demanding .",
    "the propagation of heavy nuclei on short distances ( o(10 ) mpc ) without huge energy loss is possible .",
    "some cosmologists relate the origin of hecr to topological defects  @xcite .",
    "topological defects ( td ) scenarios avoid the problems of particle acceleration since they are based on ` top  down ' evolution . very massive ( @xmath4 ev ) x ",
    "particles are emitted by the topological defects that later decay into baryons and mesons of lower energy .",
    "most of the energy is eventually carried by @xmath0rays and neutrinos , that are products of meson decay .",
    "detected hecr would then most likely be @xmath0rays .",
    "most radically , the origin of hecr has been related to those of gamma ray bursts  @xcite , replacing two extremely luminous mysteries with a single one . in such scenarios",
    "hecr are most likely to be again protons",
    ". we may not be able to observe the sources of hecr since every source might only emit a single observed ultrahigh energy particle .",
    "the nature , the type of the particle that interacted in the atmosphere to generate these giant air showers , could be the key to the understanding the origin of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "the current experimental evidence on the nature of hecr is not conclusive .",
    "the fly s eye experiment , for example , has reported correlated changes in the spectra and the composition of the ultra high energy cosmic rays  @xcite .",
    "the analysis of the fly s eye experimental statistics suggests that a change of the chemical composition of the cosmic rays from heavy nuclei to protons at @xmath5 ev is accompanied by a change of the spectral index of the cosmic ray energy spectrum .",
    "one may then conclude that the hecr are protons .",
    "the other currently running air shower experiment , agasa , does not observe  @xcite such a correlation . a re  analysis of the archival data from the sugar experiment  @xcite makes the opposite conclusion",
    " a large fraction of the highest energy showers seem to be generated by heavy nuclei ..    a correlation between the arrival directions of hecr with energy @xmath6 ev with the supergalactic plane , that contains most of the galaxies of redshift @xmath7 0.03 , has been reported  @xcite .",
    "the agasa experiment has also observed similar correlation in their data set  @xcite , although not fully consistent with the conclusions of ref .  @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the fly s eye experiment does not see such a correlation ( p. sommers for the fly s eye group , _ private communication _ ) .",
    "it also has not been observed in the sugar data  @xcite . even if confirmed in the future , a correlation with the structure of the local universe would not answer the question of the nature of hecr . if topological defects are seeds for galaxy formation most powerful galaxies and td would have similar distribution and td and astrophysical scenarios of the origin of hecr are indistinguishable .",
    "the profile of the 3@xmath8 ev shower detected by the fly s eye develops higher in the atmosphere than expected for either proton or @xmath0ray showers of that energy  @xcite . the highest energy shower seen by the agasa experiment ( @xmath9 ev ) exhibits , apart from its energy , features that are typical for most of the high energy showers .",
    "the currently existing air shower arrays can not drastically increase the experimental statistics and the hope for answering the important questions for the nature and origin of hecr is in the construction of much bigger shower arrays , such as the auger project  @xcite .",
    "even with auger , however , the nature of hecr will be difficult to study .",
    "shower parameters are subject of strong intrinsic fluctuations and the cross sections that govern inelastic interactions at @xmath10 = 100 tev are not well enough known . at lower energy ( @xmath11 ev ) showers generated by heavy nuclei",
    ", protons and @xmath0rays could be at least statistically distinguished by their muon content .",
    "@xmath0ray showers have on the average @xmath12% of the muon content of proton showers of the same energy  @xcite . at ultrahigh energies",
    "such approach may not be possible  calculations of the muon content of the @xmath0ray induced showers predict that the fraction of gev muons could be even higher than in proton generated showers  @xcite .",
    "we suggest a different approach to the study of the nature of the cosmic rays with energy above @xmath13 ev  to prove ( or disprove ) that hecr are @xmath0rays by observing their interactions with the geomagnetic field .",
    "while protons and heavier nuclei are not affected by the geomagnetic field , ultra high energy @xmath0rays interact on it to produce @xmath14 pairs .",
    "the electrons themselves quickly lose their energy through magnetic bremsstrahlung ( synchrotron radiation ) before they enter the atmosphere of the earth .",
    "air showers are thus replaced by ` magnetic + atmospheric ' showers that start far away from the surface of the earth and are absorbed faster compared to usual air showers . with high experimental statistics one can observe the interactions of ultra high energy @xmath0rays with the geomagnetic field by a study of the shower arrival direction in geographical coordinates .",
    "if the detected showers do not show signs of interactions with the geomagnetic field , the suggestions for @xmath0ray nature of hecr could be proven wrong .",
    "this article is organized in the following way .",
    "section 2 . gives a brief discussion of the photon and electron interactions on magnetic fields and of the structure of the geomagnetic field .",
    "section 3 . describes a calculation of the ` geomagnetic + atmospheric ' cascades and gives some general results of that calculation .",
    "section 4 . calculates shower parameters that could be used to confirm the @xmath0ray origin of hecr and section 5 . contains the conclusions from this research",

    "similarly the magnetic bremsstrahlung ( synchrotron radiation ) is guided by @xmath20 [ b_\\perp / b_{cr}]$ ] .",
    "the radiation emitted by an electron of energy @xmath21 in magnetic field @xmath17 per unit distance is distributed as @xmath22 where @xmath23[1 + h\\nu / e_e]/3\\upsilon_e$ ] .    to demonstrate the strength of the @xmath0ray interactions in the geomagnetic field we show in fig .",

    "the @xmath0ray trajectory is taken to be normal to the field lines of a magnetic dipole centered at the center of the earth with magnetic moment of @xmath24 gauss / m .",
    "one could see that the @xmath0rays of the energies of interest interact in a relatively narrow range of distances not further than 3@xmath25 .",
    "the narrow peak plotted at altitude of 20 km represents @xmath0rays that survive , i.e. interact in the atmosphere before they interact in the geomagnetic field .",
    "12% of the @xmath0rays with energy @xmath3 ev ( and none at higher energy ) survive .",
    "the spectra of the @xmath0rays emitted in magnetic bremsstrahlung depends quite strongly on the magnetic field strength . for strong fields",
    "the energy distribution of the secondary photons is quite flat .",

    "these distances cover much of the primary @xmath0rays interaction range shown in fig .",
    "since lower energy @xmath0rays pair produce close to the earth , the magnetic bremsstrahlung of their secondary electrons is harder .",
    "the energy spectra of the @xmath0rays in the bunch that enters the atmosphere after pair production and magnetic bremsstrahlung tend to be almost independent of the primary @xmath0ray energy @xmath27 .",
    "gamma rays arriving at any experimental location under different zenith ( @xmath28 ) and azimuthal ( @xmath29 ) angle will see a different geomagnetic field",
    ". they will thus cascade differently before reaching the atmosphere . at small @xmath28 , close to the vertical direction ,",
    "the variation with @xmath29 is insignificant . at relatively large @xmath28 , more than 30@xmath30 , the field strength for most locations changes by factors of 3 or more for different values of @xmath29 .",
    "a more quantitative calculation of the strength of the field encountered by the incoming @xmath0ray is trivial for any model of the geomagnetic field but has to be performed for each location , @xmath28 and @xmath29 separately .",
    "we have attempted to obtain a slightly more general result for several experimental locations . fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the transverse component ( @xmath17 ) of the geomagnetic field as a function of the azimuthal angle at which it arrives to the detector . since the @xmath29 variations for different zenith angles @xmath28 have the same aspect , we have integrated over @xmath28 from 0 to 60@xmath30 , weighting the field values with the solid angle .",
    "the 1991 international geomagnetic reference field model ( igrf ) is used for this calculation .",
    "four of the locations for which @xmath17 is shown are in the northern hemisphere and only one ( sydney , shown with dash  dash ) is south of the equator . since the smallest @xmath17 is seen in the direction of the magnetic pole that is closer to each location , northern and southern locations have opposite field strength dependence on @xmath29 . at the moderate latitudes of these detector locations , the detailed differences between the northern hemisphere detectors are minor .",
    "( a detector located at the geomagnetic equator would have a symmetric response to geomagnetic north and south directions ) .",
    "the difference between the maximum and minimum field strengths is almost a factor of 5 .    for each one of these detectors , as well as for any other detector location",
    ", one could determine a region in azimuth , where the field strength is the lowest and the incoming @xmath0rays would be affected minimally by the geomagnetic field and a region where the effect of the geomagnetic field is at maximum . for the location of sydney ,",
    "e.g. @xmath0rays arriving with @xmath31 would see @xmath320.02 gauss at a distance of 1 @xmath25 and @xmath0rays with @xmath33 would see more than 0.04 gauss at the same distance .",
    "the idea is that @xmath0ray fluxes arriving from these two regions may have observable characteristics that are different enough to be distinguished experimentally .",
    "we continue to study the cascading of ultra high energy gamma rays in geomagnetic fields with different strength , corresponding to these two regions .",
    "we simulate the electromagnetic cascading in the geomagnetic field by injecting @xmath0rays of energy @xmath27 at a distance of 5 @xmath25 from the surface of the earth on a trajectory with angle @xmath28 relative to the vertical direction at the intersection with the surface .",
    "the @xmath0ray is propagated with a stepsize @xmath34 ( from 1 to 10 km ) until the @xmath0ray pair produces or reaches the atmosphere .",
    "the atmosphere is defined to be at altitude of 20 km above the earth s surface .",
    "gamma rays that reach the atmosphere ` survive ' and interact in the atmosphere to produce air showers with their original injection energy .    if the @xmath0ray produces an electron ",
    "positron pair , the pair electrons are followed in similar way , by calculating their radiation spectrum on every step of propagation .",
    "the synchrotron @xmath0rays are tabulated in energy , starting at @xmath35 ev .",
    "the assumption here is that secondary @xmath0rays of energy less than @xmath35 ev do not contribute significantly to the cascades that are observed deep in the atmosphere .",
    "this lower energy end of the magnetic bremsstrahlung spectrum , as well as the electrons of energy below @xmath35 ev that enter the atmosphere , contain always less than 2% of the primary @xmath0ray .",
    "each particle produced in the geomagnetic field , as well as the ` surviving ' primary @xmath0rays then generate atmospheric cascades .",
    "the profiles of these cascades are added up to calculate the composite shower profile , generated in the atmosphere by the injected primary @xmath0ray or the products of its interaction in the geomagnetic field .",
    "the actual calculation is performed using the dipole magnetic field model with magnetic moment of @xmath24 gauss / m with two scale factors of 0.25 ( low field ) and 1.25 ( high field ) , which generate magnetic field strengths approximately equal to the maximum and minimum values shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    to study the ` survival ' probability in these two field models we made calculations for two extreme zenith angles : @xmath28 = 0@xmath30 and 60@xmath30 , which is the maximum zenith angle at which air showers can be reliably detected and analyzed .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the survival probabilities at high ( lefthand strip ) and low magnetic field strengths .",
    "the lefthand boundary of each strip corresponds to propagation at @xmath28 = 60@xmath30 and the righthand boundary is for @xmath28 = 0@xmath30 .",
    "@xmath0rays approaching the earth at higher zenith angles spend significantly more time in higher geomagnetic field strengths and have a higher interaction probability .",
    "the lefthand edge of the high field strip and the righthand edge of the low field strip practically bracket the survival probability space for @xmath0rays approaching any location at the earth surface with zenith angles smaller than 60@xmath30 .",
    "@xmath0rays arriving at higher angles may be absorbed faster .",
    "several calculations of the @xmath0ray cascading in the geomagnetic field have been previously performed  @xcite .",
    "our results are in a good agreement with the main results of all of them .",
    "our calculation is generally a refinement of previous ones , which nevertheless reveals some practically important features in the cascading process .",
    "previous calculations conclude that there will be a ` cutoff ' in the energy spectrum of the @xmath0rays that reach the atmosphere , because of the very soft spectrum of the secondary photons , generated by magnetic bremsstrahlung .",
    "this conclusion is partially due to the relatively rough treatment and low statistics in the previous work .",
    "[ fig5 ] shows the number of secondary @xmath0rays and the energy that they carry .",
    "@xmath27 = @xmath36 ev in this example .",
    "although the number of secondary @xmath0rays of energy above @xmath13 ev is on the average only 6.3 , they carry 48% of the primary energy .",
    "this is also important for the development of the subsequent air showers , because at energies above @xmath13 ev the lpm effect  @xcite , which suppresses the electromagnetic cross sections at high energy and slows the development of the air showers , becomes important in air .",
    "gamma rays of energy above @xmath13 ev , if they do exist , would only be detectable by giant air shower arrays located on the surface of the earth .",
    "air shower arrays consist of a large number of counters that trigger in coincidence when the shower from arrives .",
    "the shower direction is determined by the arrival time of the shower front at the different counters .",
    "a fit of the density in the separate counters reconstructs the total number of shower particles , the showers size @xmath37 , which is then used to determine the primary energy .",
    "the output of our monte carlo simulation includes the shower sizes calculated for several atmospheric depths from the cascading of all secondary ( and primary , if the injected gamma rays did not pair produce ) @xmath0rays in the atmosphere .",
    "the profiles from individual secondary @xmath0rays of energy above @xmath38 ev are calculated with an account for the lpm effect , although the effect is not significant below @xmath13 ev .",
    "the depths are arbitrarily chosen to include a realistic range for typical large air shower experiment and correspond to an array at vertical depth of 860 g / cm@xmath2 and zenith angles with @xmath40 = 0.9 , 0.8 , 0.7 , 0.6 and 0.5 .",
    "because the development of purely electromagnetic showers in the atmosphere ( apart from their muon content ) does not depend significantly on the atmospheric density profile , the examples given below could be scaled also to different altitudes and zenith angles .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows a general and important shower parameter  the average size ( @xmath41 ) generated by @xmath0rays of different energy .",

    "to bottom the lines show @xmath42 at the 5 different depths of 956 , 1075 , 1229 , 1433 and 1720 g / cm@xmath2 . except for the deepest observation level",

    "the power law index @xmath46 depends on the column density between the depth of the shower maximum @xmath47 and the detector .",
    "the size at maximum @xmath48 is exactly proportional to @xmath27 and @xmath46 is bigger than unity because the depth of shower maximum grows with energy as @xmath49 radiation lengths ( 1 r.l .",
    "= 37.1 g / cm@xmath2 in air ) .    the dependence shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] is more complicated because in this energy range showers are already at or before their maximum development at some of the shallower observation levels .",
    "the role of the magnetic field strength on the @xmath37 dependence on @xmath27 is easier to understand for the deepest levels of observation .",
    "compare , for example , the two curves for depth of 1720 g / cm@xmath2 with the @xmath0ray survival probability of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . at low energy , where there are no interactions on the geomagnetic field , the two curves are the same . the solid curve ( low field ) starts bending at @xmath0ray energy @xmath50 ev where the primary @xmath0rays start interacting in the geomagnetic field .",
    "because of these interactions the primary @xmath0ray is replaced by a bunch of @xmath0rays of lower energy .",
    "the composite shower reaches maximum at shallower atmospheric depths and is significantly absorbed at the deep observation level .",
    "the same happens at energy lower by about one order of magnitude in the high field case .",
    "although it is outside of the energy range of fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , at some higher energy , where all @xmath0rays interact on the geomagnetic field , the two curves will join again .",
    "to explain the behaviour at the shallow observation levels one has to take into account some of the details of the cascading in the geomagnetic field , namely the shape of the energy spectra of the secondary photons as a function of field strength , which is shown in fig .",
    "although the primary @xmath0rays interact in the same way , in the high field case the energy spectra of the secondary @xmath0rays are harder , hard enough to generate showers that are not absorbed at the level of 956 g / cm@xmath2 .",
    "one could hardly see a tiny deviation of the strong field ( dashed ) curve in the region of @xmath51 ev . at higher energies the secondaries are energetic enough to produce @xmath37 dependence very close to a power law . when the primary @xmath0rays start interacting in the low field , however , the picture is slightly different .",
    "the secondary @xmath0ray spectra are softer , the composite showers reach maxima at shallower depths and are correspondingly absorbed when they reach the observation level .",
    "the two curves will join asymptotically .",
    "all other levels show intermediate behaviour where the relation between the depth of observation and @xmath47 also contributes to the exact shape of the curve .",
    "[ fig6 ] shows the strong differences in the observable parameter @xmath37 which is introduced by the strength of the geomagnetic field .",
    "it can not be used , however , for analysis of experimental data because @xmath27 is not a directly measurable parameter .",
    "what experiments can do , and usually do , is to produce a spectrum of the measured shower sizes @xmath37 .",
    "such spectra for the three deeper observation levels are shown in fig .",
    "the solid histogram corresponds to the low field and the dashed one  to the high field case .",
    "the histograms are result of a simulation , where @xmath27 is sampled from a @xmath52 differential primary spectrum between @xmath13 and @xmath53 ev . at low @xmath37",
    "the spectra are always higher for the low field case , including the two observation levels that are not shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . at the high @xmath37 side and for shallow observation levels",
    "the high field case shows higher spectrum , as could be expected by the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] and as seen for the shallowest level plotted in fig .",
    "the biggest difference is at the deepest observation level , where the spectra are different as much as a factor of 10 .",
    "the differences between the size spectra decreases for shallower observation levels , and is probably not detectable for the two shallowest levels , which are not shown .",
    "the size spectra of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] show that it is possible to detect the difference between a flux of @xmath0rays that reach the earth after cascading in geomagnetic field of different effective strength . in practical terms",
    "this means that any experiment that is able to collect large enough experimental statistics should see different @xmath37 spectra in different azimuthal directions if hecr are indeed @xmath0rays .",
    "we have not attempted to look for this effect in the existing experimental statistics , because it is not large enough to reveal such effects .",
    "the auger project  @xcite is an entirely different story .",
    "it proposes the construction of two air shower arrays , at least 3 000 km@xmath2 each , in the northern and in the southern hemisphere . for comparison ,",
    "the area of the largest current detector ( agasa ) is 100 km@xmath2 .",
    "each one of these detectors will have the collecting power of more than 5 000 showers above @xmath13 ev per year . if the hecr primaries are @xmath0rays the norther hemisphere detector should see spectra similar to the low field case of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] in northern direction ( the exact direction and value of the minimum field depends on the location of the array ) and the strong field case in showers coming from south .",
    "the southern detector will have the opposite effect .",
    "if this were the case , the difference of the size spectra would prove that the hecr are gamma rays .",
    "the actual effects could even be stronger than shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , because the simulation on which it is based propagated all primary @xmath0rays along the vertical ( @xmath28 = 0@xmath30 ) direction .",
    "in fact , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , the increase of the interaction probability in the geomagnetic field increases by a non  negligible factor when the exact particle trajectory is accounted for .",
    "our air shower simulation also does not account for the magnetic bremsstrahlung of the shower electrons which at high @xmath21 and low atmospheric density @xmath54 g/@xmath55 could be important and could accelerate the shower development .    in principle",
    "the interplanetary magnetic field has to be added to the ` target ' magnetic field",
    ". gamma ray arriving from a cone centered on the sun would be absorbed far away from the earth and possibly not detectable .",
    "the sun could thus be visibly in ultra high energy @xmath0-rays .",
    "the exact dimensions of the region where @xmath0rays are absorbed in pair production on the solar magnetic field , carries valuable information on the magnetic field in the vicinity of the sun .",
    "this is an interesting although purely academic problem , because the statistics of such events is always going to be negligible .",
    "although we have not done it for this paper , there will be effects , similar to the @xmath37 ones , on the muon content of the @xmath0ray initiated air showers .",
    "it is well known that at these extremely high energies the number of soft muons ( 0.3 to 2 gev ) in @xmath0 initiated showers is comparable to this of hadronic showers  @xcite .",
    "the number of soft muons has an @xmath27 dependence very similar to @xmath37 , because the low energy muons decay readily when @xmath47 is distant from the observation level .",
    "the decay length of 1 gev muons is @xmath566 km . a picture similar to the @xmath37 spectra in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] will develop as a result of the cascading in geomagnetic fields of different effective strength .",
    "the major difference between the behaviour of the electron size and the muon size is that @xmath37 attenuates as a function of the column density , while @xmath57 attenuates as a function of the distance , i.e. @xmath57 will depend strongly on the shower zenith angle @xmath28 .",
    "the study of the two major components of the giant air showers can reveal the nature of the highest energy cosmic rays .",
    "if the specific dependence on the shower arrival direction is observed , then the highest energy cosmic rays are @xmath0rays .",
    "a non observation of this effect would leave us with the choice between protons and heavy nuclei",
