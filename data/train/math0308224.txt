    "the floer homology of lagrangian intersection was first defined by floer @xcite and since then , it is emerging as a powerful technique in symplectic geometry .",
    "it has received much more attention after konsevich @xcite proposed a homological mirror symmetry conjecture to use floer homology in the context of @xmath2 category that fukaya introduced@xcite .",
    "the construction of floer homology has been generalized and applied to the problems in symplectic geometry by oh @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and recently , it was studied in complete generality and its obstruction to the well - definedness of floer homology was established by fukaya , oh , ohta and ono in @xcite .",
    "but computing actual floer homologies is still a difficult task , since one has to analyze all holomorphic strips with boundary lying on two lagrangian submanifolds .",
    "the construction of floer homology in the bott - morse setting is a big step forward in this respect as in morse theory .    in this paper , we compute floer cohomology of the clifford torus @xmath3 in @xmath0 in the bott - morse setting .",
    "there are two main issues in the computation .",
    "the first one is an orientation problem .",
    "floer and oh defined floer homology with @xmath4-coefficients . in @xcite , fukaya , oh , ohta and ono developed a way to give an orientation of the moduli space of holomorphic discs(and strips ) .",
    "this orientation depends on the ( relative ) spin structure of a lagrangian submanifold .",
    "hence , one can define floer homology with @xmath5 or @xmath6-coefficient .",
    "a _ spin structure _ of an oriented vector bundle @xmath7 over @xmath8 can be understood as a homotopy class of a trivialization of @xmath7 over the 1-skeleton of @xmath8 which can be extended to the 2-skeleton of @xmath8 .",
    "it is already observed in @xcite that different homotopy classes of the trivialization of a certain bundle will reverse orientation of the moduli space , with an example in the case of maslov index 0 disc .",
    "here we give a proof of this observation in general by using the index theorem of silva in @xcite ( see theorem [ sgnchange ] ) .",
    "the clifford torus is an interesting example since it has @xmath1 different spin structures .",
    "these @xmath1 spin structures can possibly give rise to @xmath1 different floer cohomologies . or more generally , we can consider floer cohomology of @xmath3 with flat line bundles on it . it may be considered as an advantage in that we may exploit this freedom to define non - vanishing floer homology , if possible .",
    "but for the clifford torus , one can choose a natural spin structure which we will call the _ standard _ spin structure . under the standard spin structure ,",
    "it is not hard to determine the orientation of the moduli space as described in @xcite ( see section [ sec : torusori ] ) . for the other spin structures",
    ", we will determine the orientation of the moduli space by studying the change of orientation with respect to the change of spin structures .",
    "hence , we can determine orientations needed to define floer boundary operator for any spin structures of the clifford torus .",
    "the second issue is to classify all the holomorphic discs with boundary lying on a lagrangian submanifold . for that purpose",
    ", we prove the maslov index formula ( theorem [ indexformula ] ) and classify all the holomorphic discs with boundary on the clifford torus with any maslov index . in this case ,",
    "any non - constant holomorphic disc has positive maslov index , in which case bott - morse floer homology is rather easy to define .    by the classification theorem , theorem [ classify ]",
    ", we can explicitly calculate bott - morse floer boundary operators for floer cohomology .",
    "it turns out that among @xmath1 spin structures , for @xmath9 even , there is only one spin structure which gives non - vanishing floer cohomology . and",
    "for @xmath10 odd , there exists two spin structures which gives non - vanishing floer cohomology .",
    "and when it is non - vanishing , @xmath11 as a @xmath12-module is isomorphic to the singular cohomology with @xmath12-coefficient .",
    "one immediate corollary of the latter result is that intersection between the clifford torus and its hamiltonian deformation must have at least @xmath1 distinct points when the intersection is transversal . in particular",
    ", the clifford torus must intersect _ any _ hamiltonian deformations thereof .",
    "while we are in the preparation of the thesis @xcite , we have learned from oh that this latter intersection result was also proved by biran - entov - polterovich @xcite using a completely different method without using the floer homology .    as an application to physics",
    ", one can compute a d - brane floer cohomology(floer cohomololy with flat line bundle on the lagrangian submanifold ) .",
    "the homological mirror symmetry conjecture is about calabi - yau manifolds , but , its extension to fano case has been studied by hori @xcite . with minor modification from our calculation of floer cohomology , we can compute compute d - brane floer cohomology . as a result",
    ", we found @xmath13 flat line bundles with specific holonomies over the clifford torus whose floer cohomology is non - vanishing , which has been predicted by hori @xcite , hori - vafa @xcite by b - model calculation .",
    "more generally , the prediction by k. hori about the floer cohomology of lagrangian torus fibers of fano toric manifolds is that the floer cohomology of all the fibers vanish except at a finite number of base points in the momentum polytope that are critical points of the super - potential of the landau - ginzburg mirror to the toric manifold .",
    "we generalize the scheme used in the paper to this case and will prove the exact correspondence in @xcite .",
    "this is the simplified version of the author s ph .",
    "d. thesis in the university of wisconsin - madison .",
    "we would like to thank yong - geun oh for helpful discussions and invaluable support .",

    "<S> we compute the bott - morse floer cohomology of the clifford torus in @xmath0 with all possible spin - structures . </S>",
    "<S> each spin structure is known to determine an orientation of the moduli space of holomorphic discs , and we analyze the change of orientation according to the change of spin structure of the clifford torus . also , we classify all holomorphic discs with boundary lying on the clifford torus by establishing a maslov index formula for such discs . as a result , we show that in odd dimensions there exist two spin structures which give non - vanishing floer cohomology of the clifford torus , and in even dimensions , there is only one such spin structure . </S>",
    "<S> when the floer cohomology is non - vanishing , it is isomorphic to the singular cohomology of the torus ( with a novikov ring as its coefficients ) . as a corollary , we prove that any hamiltonian deformation of the clifford torus intersects with it at least at @xmath1 distinct intersection points , when the intersection is transversal .    </S>",
    "<S> we also compute the floer cohomology of the clifford torus with flat line bundles on it and verify the prediction made by hori using a mirror symmetry calculation . </S>"
