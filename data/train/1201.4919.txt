    "for @xmath0 , the evolution of a three - dimensional incompressible fluid with a moving free - surface is modeled by the incompressible euler equations :    [ euler ] @xmath1    the open subset @xmath2 denotes the changing volume occupied by the fluid , @xmath3 denotes the moving free - surface , @xmath4 denotes normal velocity of @xmath5 , and @xmath6 denotes the exterior unit normal vector to the free - surface @xmath5 .",
    "the vector - field @xmath7 denotes the eulerian velocity field , and @xmath8 denotes the pressure function .",
    "we use the notation @xmath9 to denote the gradient operator .",
    "we have normalized the equations to have all physical constants equal to 1 .",
    "this is a free - boundary partial differential equation to determine the velocity and pressure in the fluid , as well as the location and smoothness of the a priori unknown free - surface . in the case",
    "that the fluid is irrotational , @xmath10 , the coupled system of euler equations ( [ euler ] ) can be reduced to an evolution equation for the free - surface ( with potential flow in the interior ) , in which case ( [ euler ] ) simplifies to the water waves equation .",
    "_ we do not make any irrotationality assumptions .",
    "_    we will prove that the 3-d euler equations ( [ euler ] ) admit classical solutions which evolve regular initial data onto a state , at finite - time @xmath11 , at which the free - surface self - intersects , and the flow map loses injectivity .",
    "the self - intersection can occur at a point , causing a `` splash , '' or on a surface , creating a `` splat . ''",
    "we begin with a brief history of the local - in - time existence theory for the free - boundary incompressible euler equations . for the _ irrotational _ case of the water waves problem , and for 2-d fluids ( and hence 1-d interfaces ) , the earliest local existence results were obtained by nalimov @xcite , yosihara @xcite , and craig @xcite for initial data near equilibrium .",
    "beale , hou , & lowengrub @xcite proved that the linearization of the 2-d water wave problem is well - posed if the rayleigh - taylor sign condition @xmath12 is satisfied by the initial data ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "wu @xcite established local well - posedness for the 2-d water waves problem and showed that , due to irrotationality , the taylor sign condition is satisfied",
    ". later ambrose & masmoudi @xcite , proved local well - posedness of the 2-d water waves problem as the limit of zero surface tension . for 3-d fluids ( and interfaces ) , wu @xcite used clifford analysis to prove local existence of the water waves problem with _ infinite depth _ , again showing that the rayleigh - taylor sign condition is always satisfied in the irrotational case by virtue of the maximum principle holding for the potential flow .",
    "lannes @xcite provided a proof for the _ finite depth case with varying bottom_. recently , alazard , burq & zuily @xcite have established low regularity solutions ( below the sobolev embedding ) for the water waves equations .    the first local well - posedness result for the 3-d incompressible euler equations without the irrotationality assumption",
    "was obtained by lindblad @xcite in the case that the domain is diffeomorphic to the unit ball using a nash - moser iteration . in coutand and shkoller @xcite",
    ", we obtained the local well - posedness result for _ arbitrary initial geometries _ that have @xmath13-class boundaries and without derivative loss ( this framework , employing local coordinate charts in the lagrangian configuration , is ideally suited for the splash and splat singularity problems that we study herein ) .",
    "shatah and zeng @xcite established a priori estimates for this problem using an infinite - dimensional geometric formulation , and zhang and zhang proved well - poseness by extending the complex - analytic method of wu @xcite to allow for vorticity . again , in the latter case the domain was with infinite depth .",
    "it is of great interest to understand if solutions to the euler equations can be extended for all time when the data is sufficiently smooth and small , or if a finite - time singularity can be predicted for other types of initial conditions .    because of irrotationality",
    ", the water waves problem does not suffer from vorticity concentration ; therefore , singularity formation involves only the loss of regularity of the interface . in the case",
    "that the irrotational fluid is infinite in the horizontal directions , certain dispersive - type properties can be made use of .",
    "for sufficiently smooth and small data , alvarez - samaniego and lannes @xcite proved existence of solutions to the water waves problem on large time - intervals ( larger than predicted by energy estimates ) , and provided a rigorous justification for a variety of asymptotic regimes . by constructing a transformation to remove the quadratic nonlinearity , combined with decay estimates for the linearized problem ( on the infinite half - space domain ) , wu @xcite established an almost global existence result ( existence on time intervals which are exponential in the size of the data ) for the 2-d water waves problem with sufficiently small data .",
    "wu @xcite then proved global existence in 3-d for small data . using the method of spacetime resonances , germain , masmoudi , and shatah @xcite also established global existence for the 3-d irrotational problem for sufficiently small data .",
    "the study of splashing , and in particular , of drop impact on liquid surfaces has a long history that goes back to the end of the last century when worthington @xcite studied the process by means of single - flash photography .",
    "numerical studies show both fascinating and unexpected fluid behavior during the splashing process ( see , for example , oguz & prosperetti @xcite ) , with agreement from matched asymptotic analysis by howison , ockendon , oliver , purvis and smith @xcite .",
    "the problem of rigorously establishing a finite - time singularity for the fluid interface has recently been explored for the 2-d water waves equations by castro , crdoba , fefferman , gancedo , and gmez - serrano in @xcite , where it was shown that a smooth initial curve exhibits a finite - time singularity via self - intersection at a point ; they refer to this type of singularity as a `` splash '' singularity , and we will continue to use this terminology .",
    "( we will give a precise definition of the splash domain in our 3-d framework in section [ subsec : splashdomain ] and we define the splat domain in section [ sec9 ] . )",
    "their work follows earlier results by castro , crdoba , fefferman , gancedo , and lpez - fernndez @xcite and castro , crdoba , fefferman , gancedo , and lpez - fernndez @xcite for both the muskat and water waves equations wherein the authors proved that an initial curve which is graph , that satisfies the rayleigh - taylor sign condition , reaches a regime in finite time in which it is no longer a graph and can become unstable due to a reversal of the sign in the rayleigh - taylor condition .",
    "herein , we develop a new framework for analyzing the finite - time splash and splat singularity for incompressible fluid flows with vorticity .",
    "our motivation is to produce a general methodology which can also be applied to compressible fluids , as well as to ionized fluids , governed by the equations of magnetohydrodynamics .",
    "our method is founded upon the transformation of ( [ euler ] ) into lagrangian variables .",
    "we are thus not restricted to potential flows , nor to any special geometries .",
    "furthermore , our method of analysis does not , in any significant way , distinguish between flow in different dimensions . while we present our results for the case of 3-d fluid flow , they are equally valid in the 2-d case .",
    "the main result of this paper states that there exist initial domains @xmath14 of sobolev class @xmath15 together with initial velocity vectors @xmath16 which satisfy the rayleigh - taylor sign condition ( [ taylor ] ) , such that after a a finite - time @xmath11 the solution of the euler equations reaches a `` splash '' ( or `` splat '' ) singularity . at such a time @xmath17 , particles which were separated at time @xmath18",

    "this statement is made precise in theorems [ theorem_main ] and [ theorem2 ] .",
    "note that the use of @xmath15-regularity for the domain @xmath14 and @xmath23-regularity for velocity field @xmath24 is due to the functional framework that we employ for the a priori estimates in theorem [ thm_apriori ] .",
