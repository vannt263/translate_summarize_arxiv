    "in a series of papers  @xcite@xmath1@xcite we have shown that renormalizations in a softly broken susy theory follow from those of an unbroken one in a straightforward way .",
    "this is in agreement with the other approaches  @xcite and is inspired by the original observation of ref.@xcite . in what follows",
    "we give a review of our approach .",
    "it does not explicitly use the power of holomorphicity advocated by some authors  @xcite , but ends up with the simple and straightforward algorithm which is easy to apply .",
    "the main idea is that a softly broken supersymmetric gauge theory can be considered as a rigid susy theory imbedded into external space - time independent superfield @xmath2 , so that all couplings and masses become external superfields @xmath3 .",
    "then , the following crucial statement is valid  @xcite    * the statement : * _ in external spurion field @xmath2 the uv singular part of the effective action depends on the couplings @xmath3 , but does not depend on their derivatives : _",

    "with replacement of the couplings by external fields one can calculate the effective action @xmath7 assuming that the external field is a constant , i.e. in a rigid theory .",
    "this approach to a softly broken supersymmetric theory allows us to use remarkable mathematical properties of @xmath8 susy field theories such holomorphicity which leads to the non - renormalization theorems , cancellation of quadratic divergences , etc",
    ".    the renormalization procedure in a softly broken susy gauge theory can be performed in the following way :    _ one takes the renormalization constants of a rigid theory , calculated in some massless scheme , substitutes instead of the rigid couplings ( gauge and yukawa ) their modified expressions , which depend on a grassmannian variable , and expand over this variable .",
    "this gives renormalization constants for the soft terms .",
    "differentiating them with respect to a scale one can find corresponding renormalization group equations .",
    "_    thus , the soft - term renormalizations are not independent but can be calculated from the known renormalizations of a rigid theory with the help of the differential operators .",
    "explicit form of these operators has been found in a general case and in some particular models like susy guts or the mssm  @xcite .",
    "the same expressions have been obtained also in a somewhat different approach in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "in fact as it has been shown in @xcite this procedure works at all stages .",
    "one can make the above mentioned substitution on the level of the renormalization constants , rg equations , solutions to these equations , approximate solutions , fixed points , finiteness conditions , etc .",
    "expanding then over a grassmannian variable one obtains corresponding expressions for the soft terms . this way one can get new solutions of the rg equations and explore their asymptotics , or approximate solutions , or find their stability properties , starting from the known expressions for a rigid theory .    throughout the paper",
    "we assume the existence of some gauge and susy invariant regularization . though it is some problem by itself , in principle it is solvable  @xcite .",
    "provided the rigid theory is well defined , we consider the modifications which appear due to the presence of soft susy breaking terms . to be more precise , when discussing one , two and three loop calculations of the renormalization constants we have in mind dimensional reduction and the minimal subtraction scheme .",
    "though dimensional reduction is not self - consistent in general  @xcite , it is safe to use it in low orders and all the actual calculations are performed in the framework of dimensional reduction  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , our main formulae have general validity provided the invariant procedure exists .",
    "below we give some examples : the general susy gauge theory in higher loops , the mssm in low @xmath0 regime where analytical solutions to the one - loop rg equations are known exactly and in high @xmath0 regime where analytical solutions are known in iterative or approximate form .",
    "we discuss some particular solutions like the fixed point ones and examine their properties .",
    "the method allows one to get the same type of solutions for the soft susy breaking terms .",
    "the other examples are the finite n=1 susy guts and the n=2 seiberg - witten model where exact ( nonperturbative ) solution is known . here",
    "one can extend finiteness and the s - w solution to the soft terms as well .",

    "hence , to perform the susy breaking , that satisfies the requirement of `` softness '' , one can introduce a gaugino mass term as well as cubic and quadratic interactions of scalar superpartners of the matter fields @xmath27 + ( m^2)^i_j\\phi^{*}_i\\phi^j,\\label{sofl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the gaugino field , and @xmath29 is the lowest component of the chiral matter superfield .",

    "@xcite . however , the conventional choice ( [ sofl ] ) is sufficient for the goal of susy breaking and in what follows we stick to it .",
    "remarkably , one can rewrite the lagrangian ( [ sofl ] ) in terms of n=1 superfields introducing the external spurion superfields  @xcite @xmath31 and @xmath32 , where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the grassmannian parameters , as  @xcite @xmath35 + h.c . \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] thus , one can interpret the soft terms as the modification of the couplings of a rigid theory .",

    "there is no @xmath42 term in eq.([gtilold ] ) , since it is neither chiral , no antichiral and gives no contribution to eq.([sofl2 ] ) .",
    "we depart here from the holomorphicity arguments  @xcite",
    ". alternatively one should consider holomorphic and antiholomorphic gauge couplings and a separate non - chiral superfield to take care of the mixed term  @xcite .",

    ", one has to do the same in the gauge - fixing ( [ gcond ] ) and ghost ( [ gh ] ) parts in order to preserve the brst invariance .",
    "here one has the integral over the whole superspace rather than the chiral one .",
    "this means that if one adds to eq.([gtilold ] ) a term proportional to @xmath43 , it gives a nonzero contribution .",
    "moreover , even if this term is not added , it reappears as a result of renormalization .",
    "we suggest the following modification of eq.([gtilold ] ) @xmath44 which gives the final expression for the soft gauge coupling  @xcite @xmath45 it will be clear below that it is self - consistent to put @xmath46 in the lowest order of perturbation theory , but it appears in higher orders due to renormalizations .",
    "one has to take into account , however , that , since the gauge - fixing parameter @xmath15 may be considered as an additional coupling , it also becomes an external superfield and has to be modified .",
    "the soft expression can be written as @xmath47 where parameters @xmath48 and @xmath49 can be obtained by solving the corresponding rg equation ( see appendix b ) .    having this in mind ,",
    "we perform the following modification of the gauge fixing condition ( [ gcond ] ) first used in  @xcite @xmath50 then , the gauge - fixing term ( [ gf ] ) becomes @xmath51 this leads to the corresponding modification of the associated ghost term ( [ ghost ] ) @xmath52 .",
    "\\label{ghs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to understand the meaning of the @xmath53 term , consider the quadratic part of the ghost lagrangian ( [ ghs ] ) @xmath54 where we have used the explicit form of @xmath55 given in appendix b.    if one compares this expression with the usual lagrangian for the matter fields ( [ sofl2 ] ) , one finds an obvious identification of the second line with the soft scalar mass term and the third line with the mass term in a superpotential .",

    "\\label{com}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] one can see from eq.([com ] ) that the parameter @xmath60 , besides being the gaugino soft mass , plays the role of a mass of the auxiliary field @xmath61 , while @xmath53 is the soft mass of the auxiliary fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "all these fields are unphysical degrees of freedom of the gauge superfield .",
    "they are absent in the wess - zumino gauge , however , when the gauge - fixing condition is chosen in supersymmetric form ( [ gf ] ) , this gauge is no longer possible , and the auxiliary fields @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 survive .",
    "thus , the extra @xmath53 term is associated with unphysical , ghost , degrees of freedom , just like in the component approach , one has the mass of unphysical @xmath64-scalars  @xcite .",
    "when we go down with energy , all massive fields decouple , and we get the usual nonsupersymmetric yang - mills theory .",
    "the @xmath53-term is renormalized and obeys its own rg equation which can be obtained from the corresponding expression for the gauge coupling via grassmannian expansion .",
    "in due course of renormalization , this term is mixing with the soft masses of scalar superpartners and gives an additional term in rg equations for the latter",
    ".    in component formalism one has a similar term . in  @xcite , the dimensional reduction ( dred )",
    "regularization is used . in this case , one is bounded to introduce the so - called @xmath64-scalars to compensate the lack of bosonic degrees of freedom in 4 - 2@xmath64 dimensions .",
    "these @xmath64-scalars in due course of renormalization acquire a soft mass that enters into the rg equations for soft masses of physical scalar particles .",
    "this problem has been discussed in  @xcite . if one gets rid of the @xmath64-scalar mass by changing the renormalization scheme , @xmath65 , there appears an additional term in rg equations for the soft scalar masses  @xcite called x  @xcite which usually coincides with our @xmath53 .",
    "besides the modification of the gauge coupling the soft terms ( [ sofl ] ) imply the modification of the yukawa ones and the mass term @xmath66 there is , however , also the soft mass term @xmath67 . to take care of it",
    "we absorb the multiplier @xmath68 into the redefinition of the fields @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "this results in the additional modification of the yukawa couplings and the mass term @xmath71 this completes our set of substitutions .    at the end of this section",
    ", we would like to comment on the brst invariance in a softly broken susy theory .",
    "the brst transformations ( [ brstr ] ) due to our choice of normalization of the gauge and ghost fields do not depend on the gauge coupling .",
    "hence , in a softly broken theory they remain unchanged .",
    "one can easily check that , despite the substitution @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the softly broken susy theory remains brst invariant  @xcite .",
    "the modifications of the couplings introduced above are valid not only for the classical lagrangian but also for the quantum one . as follows from the analysis of the feynman diagrams in superspace  @xcite the modification of the feynman rules due to the soft terms does not influence the uv divergent part of the effective action  @xcite .",
    "this justifies the statement made above concerning the uv singular part of the effective action .",
    "the following theorem is valid :    * the theorem * _ let a rigid theory be renormalized via introduction of the renormalization constants @xmath74 , defined within some minimal subtraction massless scheme .",
    "then , a softly broken theory is renormalized via introduction of the renormalization superfields @xmath75 which are related to @xmath74 by the coupling constant redefinition _",
    "@xmath76 _ where the redefined couplings are _",
    "@xmath77    eqs.([z]-[y1 ] ) lead to a finite renormalized softly broken susy theory .",
    "however , in practice it is more convenient to consider not the renormalization constants @xmath74 but the rg equations directly .",
    "differentiating the renormalization constants @xmath75 with respect to a scale one gets the rg functions for the soft terms of a broken theory in terms of unbroken one .",
    "the resulting soft term @xmath78 functions are summarized below .",
    "* summary of the soft term renormalizations *    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     later on we consider some examples of the application of these formulas .",
    "we demonstrate now how the rg equations for the soft terms appear via grassmannian taylor expansion from those for the rigid couplings .    in",
    "what follows we would like to simplify the notations and consider numerical rather than tensorial couplings .",
    "when group structure and field content of the model are fixed , one has a set of gauge @xmath79 and yukawa @xmath80 couplings .",

    "@xmath84 stands for a sum of @xmath85 soft terms , one for each leg in the yukawa vertex and @xmath86 .",
    "now the rg equation for a rigid theory can be written in a universal form @xmath87 where @xmath88 stands for a sum of corresponding anomalous dimensions . in the same notation",
    "the soft terms ( [ ga ] ) take the form @xmath89 where @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    substituting eq.([usoft ] ) into eq.([rg ] ) and expanding over @xmath92 and @xmath93 one can get the rg equations for the soft terms @xmath94 consider first the f - terms .",
    "expanding over @xmath2 one has @xmath95 this is just the rg equation for the soft terms @xmath96 and @xmath97  @xcite .",
    "proceeding the same way for the d - terms and substituting @xmath98 one has the rg equation for the mass terms @xmath99    one can also obtain the rg equation for the individual soft masses out of field renormalization .",
    "consider for this purpose the chiral green function in a rigid theory .",

    "consider , as an illustration of the above formulas , the simplest case of a pure gauge theory  @xcite . in a rigid theory",
    "the coupling is renormalized as @xmath106 making the substitution @xmath107 one gets @xmath108  or ( up to linear terms in @xmath2 ) @xmath109 after expansion over @xmath2 this leads to equations @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the differential operator extracting linear terms over @xmath2 . as a result , we get the bare mass @xmath112 differentiating eq.([mm ] ) with respect to a scale , one gets @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the gauge field anomalous dimension @xmath115 .",
    "in fact , one does not need eq.([bb ] ) to get the rg equation form the gaugino mass and can get the same formulas ( [ bb ] ) starting directly from the rg equation for @xmath116 as shown above .",
    "one can go even further and consider a solution to the rg equation in a rigid theory .",
    "indeed , let us take a solution to the rg equation for the coupling written in quadratures @xmath117 performing the replacement of the coupling one gets @xmath118 which after expansion over @xmath2 leads to the solution for the soft mass term @xmath119 where @xmath116 is taken from eq.([al ] ) .",

    "<S> in the present review we show that renormalizations in a softly broken susy gauge theory are not independent but directly follow from those of an unbroken or rigid theory . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of a treatment of a softly broken theory as a rigid one in external spurion superfield . </S>",
    "<S> this enables one to get the singular part of effective action in a broken theory from a rigid one by a simple modification of the couplings . substituting the modified couplings into renormalization constants , rg equations , solutions to these equations , approximate solutions , fixed points , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , one can get corresponding relations for the soft terms by a simple taylor expansion over the grassmannian variables . some examples including the mssm in low and high @xmath0 regime , susy guts and the n=2 seiberg - witten model are considered .    * </S>",
