    "the exploration of the connection between statistical mechanics and quantum information has been extensive in recent years since the work @xcite .",
    "especially the research of entanglement in many - body systems has contributed to the comprehensive crossover between the two hot areas @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the finding of integer or fractional quantum hall effect in two - dimensional many - body systems imposes a challenge on the universal understanding of phase transitions , since the traditional theory for phase transition can not incorporate these novel phenomena @xcite .",
    "recently the research of quantum entanglement in two - dimensional many - body systems provides the clear characterization for different quantum orders @xcite .",
    "these facts suggest that quantum entanglement would play a vital role in the understanding of many - body effects .",
    "bipartite entanglement was first studied , and focused on the connection to the criticality in spin - chain systems@xcite .",
    "this interest comes from the fact that quantum phase transition is related to the construction of the long - range correlations in many - body systems .",
    "hence it is a natural conjecture that quantum entanglement , as a depiction of the non - local correlation , could detect the appearance of long - range correlation .",
    "great progress has been made for the block entanglement in many - body systems ; the area law of block entanglement entropy has been generally constructed by the conformal field theory .",
    "furthermore the violation of the area law has been identified as a reliable detection of quantum phase transitions in one - dimensional systems(see ref .",
    "@xcite for a comprehensive review ) .",
    "however the situation becomes complex for high - dimensional systems : the violation of the area law in one - dimensional case when the system is critical , does not seem to hold in higher dimensions@xcite . even for pairwise entanglement in many - body systems",
    "the results are not satisfying .",
    "for example , the cutoff in the definition of concurrence may lead to unphysical results when one focuses on the connection of entanglement and phase transition in many - body systems @xcite .",
    "the situation becomes more complex for multiparticle entanglement(me ) because of the absence of unified measurement for me@xcite .",
    "however , it is a natural speculation that me should play a more fundamental role than a bipartite one for the understanding of many - body effects with consideration of the universal interaction in many - body systems .",
    "recently the discussions of me in many - body systems have been given more attention because of the availability of some special entangled states , e.g. , cluster states for one - way quantum computation@xcite , @xmath0-party greenberger - horne - zeilinger(ghz ) state and @xmath1-state@xcite .",
    "although great effort has been devoted to the measurement of me , the analytical or operational measurements exist only for some special cases@xcite .",
    "the connection of quantum phase transition and me has also been discussed extensively in @xcite .",
    "however these discussions are mainly on the one - dimensional spin-1/2 @xmath2 model , and the difficulty of calculating me obstructs further exploration .",
    "recently , the global entanglement has been constructed for the quantification of me by meyer and wallach@xcite , which possesses the virtues of the availability of analytical expression and operability .",
    "moreover global entanglement is measurable experimentally since it is directly related to the mixedness of single party@xcite .",
    "another important character of global entanglement is the monotonicity under local operations and classical communication ( locc ) , if one notes that global entanglement is intimately related to the linear entropy@xcite .",
    "consequently , oliveira and his collaborators improved this definition for measuring some special entangled states , e.g. @xmath0-party @xmath1 state or ghz state@xcite .",
    "moreover the connection of the generalized global entanglement and quantum phase transition has also been explored in the one - dimensional spin-1/2 @xmath2 model , in which entanglement reaches the maximum near to the transition point@xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that the nearest neighbor coupling is beneficial to the formation of me in the one - dimensional spin-1/2 @xmath2 model .",
    "since the particle correlation is short - ranged in this model@xcite , one should note that the maximum of global entanglement maybe come from the distribution of pairwise entanglement@xcite .",
    "hence it is tempting to present a discussion about me when the correlation is long range and the coupling is beyond the nearest neighbor case .",
    "fortunately the lipkin - meshkov - glick(lmg ) model@xcite provides us the benchmark for exploring this point since the collective interaction in this model .",
    "then it is expected that me would play a critical role .",
    "recently the entanglement in the lmg model has been extensively studied , such as concurrence @xcite , one - tangle@xcite , entanglement entropy@xcite and generalized entanglement@xcite .",
    "the concurrence in the lmg model displays sensitivity to the appearance of quantum phase transition@xcite , except for some special cases@xcite .",
    "a possible explanation of this discrepancy is that the trace operation performed in the calculation of concurrence inevitably kills some correlations between spins@xcite . with respect to this point , barnum and",
    "his collaborators constructed a subsystem - independent measure of entanglement , based on a distinguished subspace of observables for the system@xcite .",
    "the named _",
    "generalized entanglement _ introduced by barnum ,",
    "_ has also been discussed in the lmg model , which displayed the ability of detecting the phase transitions@xcite .",
    "moreover the authors show the equivalency between generalized entanglement and the global entanglement defined by meyer and wallach@xcite . however , as shown in @xcite , it is indispensable for the construction of the distinguished subspace of observables to obtain the knowledge of the ground state in many - body systems , that in most cases is very difficult .",
    "the research of entanglement entropy in the lmg model shows that the entropy was divergent under thermodynamic limit near the phase transition point , and moreover shows a discontinuity at the critical point for the isotropic coupling case@xcite .    the generalized global entanglement ( gge ) , defined by oliveira , _ _ et .",
    "al.__@xcite , is a generalization of the global entanglement ( ge ) . with respect to the equivalence between barnum s generalized entanglement and ge",
    ", gge provides a universal characterization of me in many - body systems .",
    "hence , it is interesting to present a comprehensive research of gge and ge in the lmg model .",
    "our discussion also presents detailed research for antiferromagnetic coupling and some interesting results can be obtained , which is rarely touched on in the previous works .",
    "i should point out that the goal for this paper focuses on the connection between me , measured by gge and ge respectively , and quantum phase transition in the lmg model .",
    "for this purpose , the paper is organized as following . in sec.ii",
    "the hamiltonian is presented , and ground states are determined analytically",
    ". the phase diagram will be identified by introducing the proper parameter . in sec.iii",
    "the analytical expressions for gge and ge are presented .",
    "based on these formulas the multiparticle entanglements for ferro - magnetic and antiferro - magnetic couplings are discussed respectively .",
    "the conclusions and discussions are given in sec .",
    "the lmg model describes a set of spin - half particles coupled to all others with an interaction independent of the position and the nature of the elements .",
    "the hamiltonian can be written as @xmath3 in which @xmath4 and the @xmath5 is the pauli operator , and @xmath6 is the total particle number in this system .",
    "the prefactor @xmath7 is essential to ensure the convergence of the free energy per spin in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "anti - ferromagnetic or ferromagnetic interaction can be obtained dependent on @xmath8 or not(@xmath9 ) .",
    "the hamiltonian preserves the total spin and does not couple the state having spin pointing in the direction perpendicular to the field , i.e. @xmath10=0 ,    [ h , \\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\sigma_z^i]=0.\\ ] ] for isotropic coupling @xmath11 , @xmath12=0 $ ] and the spectrum of eq . can be determined exactly .",
    "however for @xmath13 , the spectrum can be determined in principle by bethe - type equations@xcite and the analytical expressions are difficult to obtain .    a distinguished character of eq . is the collective interaction , which is the same for any particle and independent of the space configuration of the system . because of long - range correlation between particles , the mean - field analysis is adaptive for this model@xcite .",
    "the research of phase transition in the lmg model has shown that there is a second - order transition at @xmath14 for the ferromagnetic case and a first - order one at @xmath15 for the antiferromagnetic case@xcite .    a proper parameter for characterizing the phase diagram is the total spin in the direction @xmath16 for the ground state .",
    "for ferromagnetic coupling , one has @xmath17 which corresponds to the disorder - order transition , and obviously the point @xmath18 is a second - order phase transition point .",
    "this phase transition could be attributed to the disappearance of the energy gap ; at the symmetric phase @xmath19 the energy gap above the ground state is finite , whereas at the broken phase @xmath20 the energy gap vanishes under thermodynamic limit@xcite . for antiferromagnetic coupling ,",
    "@xmath21 obviously there is a first - order phase transition at the point @xmath15 . for this case",
    "the energy gap above ground state vanishes only at the transition point @xmath15 under thermodynamic limit , and no level crossing happens when @xmath22@xcite .",
    "the ground state for @xmath23 can be determined analytically with the help of holstein - primakoff(hp ) transformation and low - energy approximation@xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the ground state has been obtained with the consideration of the finite number effect .",

    "@xcite , with the increment of particle number the measures for entanglement for some states are decreasing , whereas for other states tend to be steady values .",

    "with respect to the pursuit of decoherence - free space@xcite , our discussion may provide some useful information .",
    "with connection to the researches of the bipartite entanglement in many - body systems , one could note that it is difficult to construct a universal classification of phase transition based on the entanglement and its derivation .",
    "the main obstacle , in my own opinion , is the absence of physical definition of entanglement , i.e. , how and what to define an `` entanglement operator '' . since quantum entanglement is an important physical resource and can be measured experimentally , i believe in the existence of this operator .",
