    "the history of stochastic motion may be traced back to the writings of titus lucretius , describing the battling of dust particles in air @xcite . later , irregular motion of single coal dust particles was described by jan ingenhousz in 1785 @xcite .",
    "robert brown in 1827 reported the jittery motion of small particles within the vacuoles of pollen grains @xcite .",
    "possibly the first systematic recording of actual trajectories was published by jean perrin , observing individual , small granules in uniform gamboge emulsions @xcite .",
    "yet apparently the first experimental study based on the time series analysis of single particle trajectories is due to nordlund who tracked small mercury spheres in water @xcite .",
    "today single trajectory analysis is a common method to probe the motion of particles , notably , in complex biological environments @xcite .",
    "typically a diffusion process in @xmath1 dimensions is characterized by the ensemble averaged mean squared displacement ( msd ) @xmath2 here we assumed spherical symmetry and an isotropic environment , such that @xmath3 is the probability density to find the particle a ( radial ) distance @xmath4 away from the origin at time @xmath0 after release of the particle at @xmath5 at time @xmath6 . in equation ( [ eamsd ] ) we introduced the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath7 . in the limit @xmath8",
    "we encounter regular brownian diffusion . for other values of @xmath7",
    "the associated diffusion is anomalous : the case @xmath9 is called subdiffusion while for @xmath10 the process is superdiffusive @xcite . in this work we focus on subdiffusive processes . in equation ( [ eamsd ] )",
    "the generalized diffusion coefficient is of dimension @xmath11=\\mathrm{cm}^2 /\\mathrm{sec}^{\\alpha}$ ] .",
    "subdiffusion of the form ( [ eamsd ] ) is found in a variety of systems , such as amorphous semiconductors @xcite , tracer dispersion in subsurface acquifers @xcite , or in turbulent systems @xcite .",
    "in fact , subdiffusion was found from observation of single trajectories in a number of biologically relevant systems : for instance , it was shown that adeno - associated viruses of radius @xmath12 nm in a cell perform subdiffusion with @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "fluorescently labeled messenger rna chains of 3000 bases length and effective diameter of some 50 nm subdiffuse with @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "lipid granules of typical size of few hundred nm exhibit subdiffusion with @xmath15 @xcite ; and the diffusion of telomeres in the nucleus of mammalian cells shows @xmath16 at shorter times , and @xmath17 at intermediate times @xcite . a study assuming normal diffusion for the analysis of tracking data of single cell nuclear organelles shows extreme fluctuations of the diffusivity as function of time along individual trajectories , possibly pointing to subdiffusion effects @xcite .",
    "_ in vitro , _ subdiffusion was measured in protein solutions @xcite and in reconstituted actin networks @xcite .",
    "molecular crowding is often suspected as a cause of subdiffusion in living cells @xcite .",
    "currently one of the important open questions is what physical mechanism causes the subdiffusion in biological systems .",
    "single particle tracking is expected to provide essential clues to answer this question .",
    "thus , recently a method has been suggested based on the statistics of first passage times , i.e. , the distribution of times it takes a random walker to first reach a given distance from its starting point .",
    "this quantity has been shown to be a powerful tool to discriminate between ctrw and diffusion on fractals @xcite .",
    "however such an analysis requires a huge amount of data to be statistically relevant .",
    "fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ( fcs ) has also been proposed to identify the physical mechanism of subdiffusion @xcite ; but this approach is based on an indirect observable , the fluorescence correlator , which is not directly comparable with analytical results ; moreover this method needs to fit three parameters to a single curve .",
    "we here present a new method , that is based on analytical results .",
    "our approach is demonstrated to enable one to extract more , and more accurate , information from a set of single particle trajectories .",
    "a typical single particle tracking experiment provides a time series @xmath18 of the particle position from which one may calculate the time averaged mean squared displacement @xmath19 ^ 2dt.\\ ] ] here @xmath20 denotes the overall measurement time , and @xmath21 is a lag time defining a window swept over the time series . for a brownian random walk with typical width @xmath22 of the step length and characteristic waiting time @xmath23 between successive steps ,",
    "we recover the time average @xmath24 , where the diffusion constant becomes @xmath25 $ ] . in this case",
    "the time average provides exactly the same information as the ensemble average .",
    "note that this is not always the case when the dynamics is subdiffusive @xcite .",
    "using time averages to analyze the behavior of a single particle is an elegant method , in particular , to avoid errors from averages over particles with nonidentical physical properties .",
    "however in many cases the actual trajectories are too short to allow one to extract meaningful information from the time average .",
    "moreover , in cases where the subdiffusion is governed by a ctrw with diverging characteristic waiting time the values of the moments , and therefore their ratios , become random quantities @xcite .",
    "using the ensemble average prevents this problem .",
    "we therefore consider herein ensemble averages calculated directly from measured trajectories .",
    "in particular we present an analysis based on a mean maximal excursion statistics .",
    "it will be shown that this method provides relevant information on the system , complementary to results from analysis of regular moments .",
    "moreover we demonstrate that the mean maximal excursion method may obtain more accurate information about the dynamics than the typically measured mean squared displacement ( [ eamsd ] ) .    in what follows",
    "we present the theoretical background of the mean maximal excursion analysis and discuss how different dynamic processes can be discriminated .",
    "we then discuss how to apply these methods in practice , including the analysis of some recent single particle tracking data .",
    "as a benchmark for our quantitative analysis we here define the three most prominent approaches to subdiffusion . physically these processes are fundamentally different , while they all share the form ( [ eamsd ] ) of the mean squared displacement . in the supplementary material we provide details on",
    "how we simulate the time series based on the stochastic models .    _",
    "( i ) continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) .",
    "_ ctrw defines a random walk process during which the walker rests a random waiting time , drawn from a probability distribution , between successive steps @xcite .",
    "if the density of waiting times is of the long tailed form @xmath26 for @xmath9 , the mean waiting time @xmath27 diverges , and the resulting process becomes subdiffusive with mean squared displacement ( [ eamsd ] ) .",
    "the exponent @xmath7 from the waiting time density ( [ wtd ] ) is then the same as in equation ( [ eamsd ] ) .",
    "if the variance of the associated jump lengths is again @xmath22 , the generalized diffusion coefficient becomes @xmath28 .",
    "waiting times with such power - law distribution were , for instance , observed for the motion of probes in a reconstituted actin network @xcite .",
    "ctrw is used in a wide variety of fields , ranging from charge carrier motion in amorphous semiconductors @xcite , over tracer diffusion in underground aquifers @xcite , up to weakly chaotic systems @xcite .    _",
    "( ii ) diffusion on fractals .",
    "_ a random walker moving on a geometric fractal , for instance , a percolation cluster near the percolation threshold , meets bottlenecks and dead ends on all scales , similar to the motion in a labyrinth .",
    "this results in an effective subdiffusion in the embedding space .",
    "while the fractal dimension @xmath29 characterizes the geometry of the fractal , the diffusive dynamics involves an additional critical exponent , the random walk exponent @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "the latter is related to the anomalous diffusion exponent through @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "fractals can be used to model complex networks , and have recently been suggested to mimic certain features of diffusion under conditions of molecular crowding @xcite .",
    "we will use for the theoretical descriptions the dynamical scheme of reference @xcite .    _",
    "( iii ) fractional brownian motion ( fbm ) .",
    "_ fbm was introduced to take into account correlations in a random walk : the state of the system at time @xmath0 is influenced by the state at time @xmath33 . in the fbm model",
    "this is achieved by passing from a gaussian white noise @xmath34 to fractional gaussian noise @xmath35db(\\tau)\\right ) , \\label{fbmnoise}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the hurst exponent @xmath36 is connected to the anomalous diffusion exponent by @xmath37 .",
    "fbm therefore describes both subdiffusion and superdiffusion up to the ballistic limit @xmath38 .",
    "fbm is used to describe the motion of a monomer in a polymer chain @xcite or single file diffusion @xcite .",
    "fbm has recently been proposed to underlie the diffusion in a crowded environment @xcite .",
    "the autocorrelation function of fbm in 1d reads @xcite @xmath39 ) . following reference @xcite , we extend fbm to several dimensions such that a @xmath1-dimensional fbm of exponent @xmath40 is a process in which each of the coordinates follows a one - dimensional fbm of exponent @xmath40 .",
    "the resulting @xmath1-dimensional fbm still satisfies ( [ eamsd ] ) , with @xmath37 .",
    "the parameters in the three simulation models are chosen to produce the same anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath41 . using only the classical analysis based on the msd ( [ eamsd ] ) , one could not tell which model was used to create the data .",
    "we discuss here how additional observables allow one to extract a more accurate value of this @xmath7 exponent , and how they may be used to distinguish the microscopic stochastic mechanisms .",
    "a power law fit to the classical msd ( [ eamsd ] ) provides the magnitude of the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath7 .",
    "we here show that the mme method is a better observable to determine @xmath7 .",
    "the maximal excursion is the greatest distance @xmath4 , that the random walker reaches until time @xmath0 .",
    "this quantity is averaged over all trajectories , to obtain the mme second moment @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the probability that the maximal distance from the origin that is reached up to time @xmath0 , is equal to @xmath44 .",
    "the mme second moment ( [ mme2 ] ) scales like @xmath45 , as shown in reference @xcite for fractal media , and derived in the supplementary material for a ctrw process .    for fbm",
    "this quantity is not known , similar to the first passage in other than a semi - infinite domain in 1d .",
    "however , one can still use the mme method to numerically analyze data created by an fbm process , as shown below .",
    "why is the mme second moment better than the more standard msd ?",
    "the ratio @xmath46 of the standard deviation @xmath47 versus the mean is a measure for the dispersion around the center of the distribution ( first moment ) .",
    "a lower ratio means that the random variable has a smaller spread around its mean .",
    "this will produce a smoother average and thus a more accurate fit as the larger number of data points closer to the average value receive a higher relative weight .",
    "indeed , for regular brownian motion the ratio is smaller for the mme second moment than for the regular second moment , the time independent values being @xmath48 1.44 , and 1.34 for one , two , and three dimensions .",
    "the mme method is therefore expected to non - negligibly outperform the msd method .",
    "details of this calculation are presented in the supplementary material . for diffusion on a fractal",
    ", the ratio @xmath49 also grows with decreasing fractal dimension , being always greater than @xmath50 . for a ctrw the ratio @xmath49 diminishes as well with decreasing @xmath7 , reaching its lowest value at @xmath51 .",
    "but it is always larger than 1 in dimensions @xmath52 .    another way to characterize",
    "the dispersion of the mme method versus regular moments is the ratio of the fourth moment versus the second moment of the respective distribution : ( i ) for a random walk on a fractal , approximated by the dynamical scheme of reference @xcite , the mme moments become @xcite @xmath53 where the prefactor is given through @xmath54 here @xmath55 is the modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "the regular moments satisfy an analogous relation @xcite , @xmath56/2)}{\\gamma(\\alpha d_f/2)}\\left(4kt\\right/\\alpha^2)^{k\\alpha/2}. \\label{proc - msd}\\ ] ] the ratios @xmath57 and @xmath58 are therefore time independent numerical constants .",
    "note that above expressions also contain the limiting case of brownian motion ( integer dimension , and @xmath8 ) .",
    "in the latter case the associated values are listed in table [ rtab ] , demonstrating again that the mme distribution is more concentrated and therefore more amenable to parameter extraction by fitting , see also the discussion below .",
    "@ccccc & @xmath7 & 1 d & 2 d & 3 d @xmath59 & 1 & 3 & 2 & 5/3 @xmath60 & & 1.77 & 1.49 & 1.36 @xmath59 & 1/2 & @xmath61 & @xmath62 & @xmath63 @xmath60 & & 2.78 & 2.33 & 2.14    \\(ii ) for fbm , the regular moments are obtained from the brownian ones by simple replacement of time @xmath0 by @xmath45 .",
    "since the regular moment ratios are time independent we find exactly the same values as in the brownian case .",
    "the mme moments are not known analytically , so we performed numerical simulations to get an estimate of these quantities .",
    "a surprising result is that the mme moments @xmath64 are proportional to @xmath65 , but with a new exponent @xmath66 .",
    "we discuss these results in detail in the supplementary material , finding a linear correlation ( @xmath67 for 10 points ) between the two exponents : @xmath68 we note that for brownian motion ( @xmath69 ) , we retrieve the classical result @xmath70 .",
    "we also obtained an expression for the mme moment ratio , @xmath57 , in 2d ( @xmath71 for 10 points ) : @xmath72 we note that solely focusing on the determination of @xmath73 from the second mme moment may lead to an overestimation of the anomalous diffusion exponent if the motion is governed by fbm and @xmath73 is not converted to @xmath7 via relation ( [ eq : fbm - ratio ] ) .",
    "it is therefore important to also evaluate the complementary criteria such as the mean squared displacement and the moment ratios .",
    "\\(iii ) in the case of ctrw subdiffusion we profit from the fact that in laplace space we can transform the probability density and the moments of normal brownian motion into the corresponding ctrw subdiffusion solution by so - called subordination @xcite . in practice",
    "this means that we can replace @xmath74 by @xmath75 where @xmath74 is the laplace variable conjugated to time @xmath0 .",
    "we obtain the ratio for both regular moments and mme statistics from the brownian result , however , with different pre - factors @xmath76 table [ rtab ] shows the results for @xmath77 .    the moment ratios @xmath78 and @xmath79 are useful observables . once we determine the anomalous exponent @xmath7 from fit to the msd or the second mme moment we can use the moment ratios to identify the process . if the moment ratio for a subdiffusion process with @xmath9 is the same as for brownian motion we are dealing with an fbm process . if the value matches the one for ctrw subdiffusion for the given @xmath7 we verify the ctrw mechanism .",
    "finally , we can identify the remaining possibility , i.e. , diffusion on a fractal : the obtained numerical value for the ratio allows us , in principle , to deduce the underlying fractal dimension @xmath29 , using the predicted values of equation ( [ proc - mme ] ) and ( [ proc - msd ] ) .",
    "we will discuss below how reliable such classifications are .",
    "finally we establish a criterion to distinguish diffusion on a fractal from ctrw and fbm subdiffusion .",
    "we know that the probability density for a diffusing particle on a fractal satisfies the scaling relation @xcite @xmath80 the same relation holds for a ctrw or a fbm if we replace @xmath29 by the euclidian dimension .",
    "let us focus on the probability to be in a growing sphere of radius @xmath81 .",
    "then @xmath82 since the exponent @xmath7 is known from the second mme moment fit we can extract @xmath29 from above relation .      collecting the results from this section we come up with the following recipe to analyze diffusion data obtained from experiment or simulation , compare also the results summarized in table [ sumtab ] .",

    "different subdiffusion mechanisms can the be determined as follows : ( 2 ) diffusion on a fractal has regular and mme moment ratios , that depend on both @xmath7 and the fractal dimension @xmath29 .",
    "the fractal dimension is smaller than the embedding euclidean dimension .",
    "( 3 ) ctrw subdiffusion has regular and mme moments that depend on the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath7 .",
    "the ratios are larger than the corresponding brownian quantities .",
    "the probability to be in a sphere growing like @xmath93 is constant .",
    "( 4 ) fbm has the same ratios for regular moments as brownian motion .",
    "the mme second moment exponent is greater than @xmath7 , and the mme ratio is smaller than the brownian one .",
    "the probability to be in a sphere growing like @xmath93 is constant .",
    "we now turn to the question how experimental data can be analyzed by help of the tools established above . in a typical experiment a small particle is tracked by a microscope , the motion being projected onto the focal plane ( 2d ) , to produce a time series @xmath94 of the particle positions . given a set of @xmath95 trajectories @xmath96",
    ", with @xmath97 steps in trajectory @xmath98 , we first calculate the distances to the starting point , @xmath99 ^ 2+\\left[y_i(t)-y_i(0)\\right]^2},\\ ] ] in the 2d projection of the motion monitored in the experiment .",
    "the propagator is not directly accessible in an experiment .",
    "however , division of the number of trajectories being at @xmath4 for a given time @xmath0 in the 2d projection , by the total number of trajectories of length @xmath100 , leads to a good estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "we can therefore transform all the previous integrals defining the moments into discrete sums , and apply above methods .      in discrete form the @xmath101th order moments become @xmath102 and @xmath103 for regular and mme statistics , respectively . here",
    "@xmath104 is the number of trajectories that are at least @xmath0 steps long .",
    "note that the discrete mme moments defined here do not correspond exactly to the theoretical definition provided before .",
    "in fact , we do not have access to the whole trajectory , but only some sample points of it , with a given time step between two consecutive frames .",
    "the real @xmath105 may be reached in between two frames , and therefore would not be observed .",
    "however after sufficiently long time the difference between the discrete estimate calculated here and the real value from the continuous trajectory becomes sufficiently small .",
    "figure [ test1 ] shows the result of fits of the msd and the second mme moment to simulated data according to the three subdiffusion models , all with anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath106 .",
    "indeed the mme method performs somewhat better .",
    "we should note that these simulation results are fairly smooth , and therefore we would not expect a significant difference between the two methods , in contrast to the results on the experimental data below",
    ". also note that we chose different anomalous diffusion constants @xmath107 to be able to distinguish the different curves in figure [ test1 ] .",
    "of course , this does not influence the quality of the fit of the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath7 .     and",
    "second mme moment @xmath108 as function of time @xmath0 ( arbitrary units ) for the three simulated time series ( @xmath109 trajectories of @xmath110 steps each ) , each with anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath106 .",

    "as mentioned above some care has to be taken with the latter : only the long time values have a physical meaning .",
    "in fact , for the first frame , the moment estimate @xmath121 is exactly @xmath122 , because of the discrete time step .",
    "after few dozens of frames , the estimate @xmath121 converges toward its correct value , and the ratios become meaningful .    in figure [ test3 ]",
    "we show a plot of the moment ratios .",
    "the convergence to a constant value attained at sufficiently long times is distinct .",
    "the ratios are those predicted for both ctrw and fbm , where the simulation is performed in a free environment . for diffusion on a percolation cluster , we observe a deviation from the prediction , due to the confinement of the diffusion for this set : the propagator does not converge toward the free space propagator , but toward the stationary distribution .",
    "we note that these ratios are clearly distinguishable between regular and mme moments , but also between the three simulations sets . knowing the @xmath7 value from the previous power law fit of msd or second mme moment , those ratios are already a good indication of the underlying stochastic process .",

    "time is scaled in second , the ordinate is in @xmath150m@xmath151.,height=332 ]    in order to gain more insight into the diffusion mechanism producing this subdiffusion behavior , we applied the methodology detailed above .",
    "since the different trajectories were not all recorded at the same frequency ( 96.5 and 99.1 frames per second ) , we kept only the greater set ( 96.5 fps ) , containing 5 trajectories , and we split those into 526 short trajectories of 100 steps each .",
    "these trajectories are non overlapping and one may view them as the result of 526 separate observations .",
    "surprisingly , we retrieve the exponent @xmath159 using the msd , and the value @xmath160 from the second mme moment , as shown in figure [ exp2:msd ] .",
    "we repeated this analysis with a step size of 150 ( 350 trajectories ) concluding that the choice of the step size 100 has no influence on the value of those coefficients .",
    "since one of the trajectories ( the magenta line in figures [ exp2:dan ] and [ exp2:danmme ] ) shows a much steeper slope , we excluded it for the rest of the analysis .",
    "subtrajectories of @xmath110 steps extracted from the experimental set of @xmath161 trajectories , that are between @xmath155 and @xmath156 frames long .",
    "ensemble averaged msd ( black @xmath162 ) fitted by a power law ( @xmath163 , black line ) , and ensemble averaged mme ( red @xmath162 ) , fitted with a power law ( @xmath164 , red line ) .",
    "we verified that creating @xmath165 trajectories of @xmath166 steps instead of @xmath110 does not change the exponents obtained from the msd or the second mme moment ( @xmath112 instead of @xmath162 symbols ) .",
    "since one of the trajectories had a steeper slope than the others , we repeated the same analysis without this trajectory , the new subset containing @xmath167 trajectories of @xmath110 steps , or @xmath168 of @xmath166 steps",
    "( msd in blue leading to @xmath169 , second mme moment in magenta producing @xmath170 ) .",
    "time is in seconds , the ordinate is measured in @xmath150m@xmath151.,height=332 ]    an interesting observation is the following : assuming that the underlying stochastic process is indeed an fbm , relation ( [ eq : fbm - mme ] ) for @xmath163 predicts a value @xmath171 for the mme statistics , in quite good agreement with the fitted value .",
    "this finding is quite suggestive in favor of fbm as the stochastic process governing the particle motion .",
    "since the trajectories correspond to different granules , in different cells , we also studied them separately : each trajectory was split into stretches of 100 steps . for each granule",
    ", we plotted the regular and the mme ratios .",
    "they are somewhat noisy , but for each granule the mme ratio is clearly below the brownian one ( 1.49 ) : it ranges between 1.20 and 1.40 .",
    "the regular moment ratio is slightly above the brownian value ( 2 ) , between 1.7 and 2.5 , as shown in figure 3 of the supplementary material . in the same figure we also plotted the ratio for the whole set of 100 steps pieces ( thick lines ) , which give approximately the same results as those obtained for individual trajectories . from these ratios",
    ", we obtain another clue pointing at an underlying fbm mechanism : the mme moment ratio is , on average , below the value for brownian motion , and the regular moment ratio close to the brownian value .",
    "these mme ratios are not very precise , but seem to range somewhat above the expected value for fbm with @xmath163 : equation ( [ eq : fbm - ratio ] ) gives @xmath172 .",
    "the test with the growing sphere is , once again , somewhat noisy , however , it clearly shows that the probability to be in a sphere , growing like @xmath93 , attains a constant value ( see figure 4 of the supplementary material ) .",
    "this excludes the possibility that the process corresponds to diffusion on a fractal .",
    "the above analysis demonstrates that the tools proposed in this study allow us to classify the stochastic process underlying the motion of the measured single particle trajectories of the granules .",
    "we observe that this motion shares several distinct features with an fbm process .",
    "namely fbm explains the finding of different scaling exponents of the msd and the mme second moment , including their actual values connected by equation ( [ eq : fbm - mme ] ) .",
    "it is also consistent with a brownian regular moment ratio , and an mme ratio lower than the brownian one ( compare figure 3 of the supplementary material ) .",
    "the recorded data were also shown to be incompatible with diffusion on a fractal .",
    "so what about ctrw as potential mechanism ?",
    "the scatter between different single trajectories observed in the time averaged second moments is reminiscent of the weak ergodicity breaking for ctrw subdiffusion with diverging characteristic waiting time , as studied in references @xcite .",
    "however an alternative explanation may simply be different environments and granule sizes .",
    "it should be noted that even between successive recordings the cellular environment may change slightly , influencing the motion of the observed particle .",
    "the ctrw hypothesis however is not consistent with the moment ratio test : the expected ratio for @xmath173 would be 3.38 for the regular one , and 2.50 for the mme , far above the observed values .    given the clues we obtained from the analysis , the experimental data quite clearly point toward an fbm as underlying stochastic process .",
    "more extensive data acquisition is expected to allow more precise conclusions .",
    "with modern tracking tools biophysical experiments provide us with the time series of single particle trajectories .",
    "recently a growing number of cases have been reported in which the monitored particles exhibit subdiffusion .",
    "an important example is the motion of biopolymers under cellular crowding conditions .",
    "while the mean squared displacement of these data , scaling like @xmath174 , provides the anomalous diffusion exponent @xmath7 , the underlying physical mechanism causing this subdiffusion is presently unknown . as different mechanisms give rise to fundamentally different physical behaviors influencing the particle diffusion in a living cell , it is important to obtain information from experimental or simulation data other than the anomalous diffusion exponent , allowing us to pin down the specific stochastic process .",
    "we here introduced and studied several observables to analyze more quantitatively single particle trajectories of freely ( sub)diffusing particles . for long trajectories with active motion events",
    "the latter may be singled out and our analysis performed on the passive parts of the trajectories @xcite . as typical experimental data sets are relatively short , we here focus on the ensemble average obtained from a larger number of individual trajectories .",
    "the data were simulated on the basis of three subdiffusion models , these being continuous time random walk with power law waiting time density , fractional brownian motion , and diffusion on a fractal support .",
    "moreover we analyzed two sets of experimental single particle tracking data , corresponding to a brownian and a subdiffusive system .",
    "in particular we propose alternative measures to the usual fit to the mean squared displacement . apart from obtaining the fourth order moment and",
    "construct the ratio @xmath58 , these alternatives are : ( i ) mean maximum excursion statistics that the particle has not traveled more than a preset distance up to time @xmath0 .",
    "its second and fourth moments , theoretically , scale with time the same way as the regular moments ; however , they appear to reproduce more truthfully the actual subdiffusion exponents .",
    "constructing the ratio @xmath175 for these quantities provides additional information , that allows one to distinguish different subdiffusion mechanisms .",
    "( ii ) the analysis using a growing sphere containing a certain portion of particles appears as a quite reliable method to obtain the ( fractal ) dimension of the underlying trajectory .",
    "an application to an experimental set proves the efficiency of those tests : the mme analysis is clearly more accurate than the classical msd one , and with a modest data set we are able to collect several independent clues to identify fbm as mechanism to explain the motion of lipid granules under molecular crowding conditions . for long recorded time",
    "series the performance of the mme and regular moments analysis becomes comparable .    from the discussion of simulations and experimental data is was shown that in order to understand the physical mechanism of anomalous diffusion in a given set of data one needs to gather evidence from complementary measures , such as the ones proposed in this study .",
