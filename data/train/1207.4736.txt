    "this paper addresses the question of how to predict the time a lvy process attains its ultimate supremum with an infinite time horizon .",
    "( due to the jumps a lvy process can experience , the word `` attains '' is used here in a slightly broader sense than when the driving process is continuous , cf .",
    "section [ sec_main1 ] ) .",
    "that is , we aim to find a stopping time that is closest ( in @xmath0 sense ) to the time the lvy process attains its ultimate supremum .",
    "this is an example of an _ optimal prediction problem_. it is related to classic and well - studied optimal stopping problems .",
    "however , the key difference is that the payoff process is not adapted to the filtration generated by the driving stochastic process . indeed , in our case , the time the lvy process attains its ultimate supremum is not known ( with absolute certainty ) at any ( finite ) time @xmath3 .",
    "however , as time progresses , more information about the time of the ultimate supremum becomes available .",
    "examples of optimal prediction problems where this is not the case include the `` hidden target '' type problems studied in @xcite .    in recent years",
    "optimal prediction problems have received considerable attention , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "one reason is that such problems have found applications in fields such as engineering , finance and medicine .",
    "prominent examples concern the optimal time to sell an asset ( in finance ) or the optimal time to administer a drug ( in medicine ) .",
    "the papers referred to above are mainly concerned with optimal prediction problems driven by brownian motion ( with drift ) , particularly with a finite time horizon .",
    "some exceptions are @xcite which deals with random walks , @xcite with mean - reverting diffusions and @xcite which deals with spectrally positive stable processes .",
    "the same problem as we consider was studied in @xcite , however for a brownian motion with drift and a finite time horizon . in that paper",
    "it is also postulated that for a general lvy process the structure of the solution is the same as they found for the brownian motion with drift .",
    "see also remark [ rem_kevin ] .    in this paper , the driving process is a general lvy process @xmath4 drifting to @xmath2 , i.e. @xmath5 a.s .",
    "( otherwise the problem we consider is trivial as we will briefly point out in the sequel ) .",
    "we are interested in solving    @xmath6,\\ ] ]    where @xmath1 is the time @xmath4 attains its ultimate supremum ( cf .",
    "section [ sec_main1 ] for details ) and the infimum is taken over all stopping times @xmath7 with respect to the filtration generated by @xmath4 . following @xcite , due to the stationarity and independence of the increments of @xmath4 , ( [ def_main1 ] )",
    "can be expressed as an optimal stopping problem driven by the reflected process @xmath8 given by @xmath9 for all @xmath10 , where @xmath11 denotes the running supremum of @xmath4 .",
    "this allows us to show the following .",
    "if @xmath1 has infinite mean then ( [ def_main1 ] ) is degenerate in the sense that it equals @xmath12 .",
    "now suppose @xmath1 has finite mean .",
    "if the law of the ultimate supremum @xmath13 has an atom in @xmath14 of size at least @xmath15 then @xmath16 is optimal in ( [ def_main1 ] ) .",
    "otherwise , the infimum in ( [ def_main1 ] ) is attained by the first time @xmath8 enters an interval @xmath17 for some @xmath18 strictly larger than the median of the law of @xmath19 .",
    "we derive pasting properties and in the special case that @xmath4 is spectrally negative we obtain ( semi-)explicit expressions for ( [ def_main1 ] ) and @xmath18 in terms of so - called scale functions .",
    "note that the problem ( [ def_main1 ] ) with a finite time horizon ( rather than an infinite time horizon as we consider ) is potentially more interesting from the point of view of applications .",
    "however , it is also considerably more challenging than the infinite horizon case . as motivated in @xcite ( cf . also remark [ rem_kevin ] ) it should be expected that in the finite horizon case the optimal stopping time is of the form the first time that the reflected process @xmath8 exceeds some time - dependent curve . for a brownian motion with drift as considered in @xcite , this curve is specified only implicitly as the solution to a nonlinear integral equation .",
    "their proof relies on first reducing the optimal prediction problem to an optimal stopping problem ( also with a finite horizon , cf .",
    "their lemma 2 ) , which is then solved by the well - known technique of representing the value function of the optimal stopping problem and the time - dependent curve determining the optimal stopping time as a system with a pde in a domain that has a free boundary .    hence ,",
    "if for a brownian motion with drift in the finite horizon case the optimal stopping time can only be implicitly characterised , it should not be expected to be anything more explicit when a more general lvy process drives the problem .",
    "as outlined above , in the infinite horizon case we derive rather explicit results , in particular for spectrally one - sided lvy processes .",
    "( however , our results should also lead to rather explicit results for the large family of meromorphic lvy processes ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) for instance ) . in the finite horizon case ,",
    "lemma 2 from @xcite still applies and then any of the available approximation techniques for finite expiry optimal stopping problems driven by lvy processes could be used .",
    "see for instance @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . for a canadisation based method ( cf .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) the results in this paper should prove useful as that method consists of solving a recursive sequence of optimal stopping problems , each of which is a variation of the infinite horizon problem .    the rest of this paper is organised as follows . in section [ sec_prel ]",
    "we discuss some preliminaries and some technicalities to be used later on . in section [ sec_main1 ]",
    "we introduce our main result , theorem [ thm_main ] .",
    "section [ sec_proof ] is then dedicated to the proof of theorem [ thm_main ] . in section [ sec_infmean ]",
    "we discuss the case that @xmath1 has infinite mean .",
    "we make our results more explicit in the case that @xmath4 is spectrally negative in section [ subsec_sn ] . in that section",
    "we also work out the examples of a brownian motion with drift , a brownian motion with drift plus negative jumps and a drift plus negative jumps .",
    "finally , in the appendix we collect the proofs of the lemmas discussed in section [ sec_prel ] .",
