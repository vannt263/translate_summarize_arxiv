    "even though the mn containing oxides with the perovskite - like structure have been studied for more than a half century,@xcite various phase transitions occurring on doping in these materials are not fully understood .",
    "in particular , lamno@xmath0 exhibit rich and interesting physical properties because of the strong interplay between lattice distortions , transport properties and magnetic ordering . this compound also have a very rich phase diagram depending on the doping concentration , temperature and pressure ; being either antiferromagnetic ( af ) insulator , ferromagnetic ( f ) metal or charge ordered ( co ) insulator.@xcite the magnetic behavior of the lamno@xmath0 perovskite is particularly interesting , because the jahn - teller ( jt ) distortion is accompanied by the so - called a - type antiferromagnetic ( a - af ) spin ( moment ) and c - type orbital ordering ( oo ) , i.e , alternative occupation of @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the @xmath1 plane and same type of orbital occupation perpendicular to the @xmath1 plane.@xcite recently manganites have also been subjected to strong interest due to their exhibition of negative colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) effects.@xcite in particular the perovskite - oxide system la@xmath7ae@xmath8mno@xmath0 , where @xmath9 is a divalent alkali element such as ca or sr , have attracted much attention primarily due to the discovery of a negative cmr effect around the ferromagnetic transition temperature @xmath10 , which is located near room temperature.@xcite the mutual coupling among the charge , spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in perovskite - type manganites creates versatile intriguing phenomena such as cmr,@xcite field - melting of the co and/or oo state(s ) accompanying a huge change in resistivity,@xcite field - induced structural transitions even near room temperature,@xcite field control of inter - grain or inter - plane tunneling of highly spin - polarized carriers,@xcite etc .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed for cmr , such as double exchange,@xcite dynamical jt effect,@xcite antiferromagnetic fluctuation,@xcite etc . , but no consensus has been attained so far about the importance of those mechanisms . since the spin , charge , orbital and structural ordering phenomena may affect cmr at least indirectly it is important to obtain a full understanding of the mechanism stabilizing the observed a - af order in the undoped insulating mother compound lamno@xmath0 .    it has been suggested that an understanding of hole - doped lamno@xmath0 must include , in addition to the double - exchange mechanism,@xcite strong electron correlations,@xcite a strong electron - phonon interaction@xcite and cooperative jt distortions associated with mn@xmath11 .",
    "several theoretical studies have been made on this material using the mean - field approximation@xcite , numerical diagonalization,@xcite gutzwiller technique,@xcite slave - fermion theory,@xcite , dynamical mean - field theory@xcite , perturbation theory@xcite and quantum monte - carlo technique.@xcite nevertheless it is still controversial as to what is the driving mechanism of the experimentally established properties , particularly the strongly incoherent charge dynamics , and what the realistic parameters of theoretical models are .",
    "by calculating and comparing various experimentally observed quantities one can get an idea about the role of electron correlations and other influences on the cmr effect in these materials .",
    "hence , theoretical investigations of ground state and excited state properties are important to understand the exotic physical properties of these materials .    the importance of spin and lattice degrees of freedom on the metal - insulator transition in lamno@xmath0 is studied extensively.@xcite popovic and satpathy@xcite showed how the cooperative jt coupling between the individual mno@xmath12 centers in the crystal leads to simultaneous ordering of the distorted octahedron and the electronic orbitals .",
    "it is now accepted that oo and magnetic ordering ( mo ) are closely correlated and that the anisotropy in the magnetic coupling originates from oo.@xcite so in order to understand the origin of oo , it is important to study the energetics of different spin - ordered states .",
    "ahn and millis@xcite calculated the optical conductivity of lamno@xmath0 using a tight - binding parameterization of the band structure .",
    "they noted a troubling discrepancy with lsda band - theory calculations@xcite of the optical conductivity and concluded with the need for further work to find the origin of the difference .",
    "hence , accurate calculations of optical properties is expected to give more insight into the origin of the discrepancy .",
    "an appreciable faraday rotation has been observed in hole - doped lamno@xmath0 thin films@xcite and hence it has been suggested that these ferromagnetic films may be used to image vortices in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "further , due to the half - metallic behavior in the f phase of lamno@xmath0 one can expect a large magneto - optical effect .",
    "for this reason , we have calculated the optical and magneto - optical properties of this material .",
    "the simultaneous presence of strong electron - electron interactions within the transition - metal 3@xmath2 manifold and a sizable hopping interaction between transition metal ( @xmath13 = ti@xmath14cu ) 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath15 states are primarily responsible for the wide range of properties exhibited by transition - metal oxides . often the presence of a strong intraatomic coulomb interaction makes a single - particle description of such systems inadequate . due to this deficiency , the density - functional calculations often fail@xcite to predict the insulating behavior of lamno@xmath0 . to correct this deficiency of the local spin - density approximation ( lsda ) to give the right insulating properties of the perovskites ,",
    "lsda+@xmath16 theory@xcite is applied , where @xmath16 is the intrasite coulomb repulsion . from experimental and theoretical studies",
    "it has been believed that the electron correlations in the la@xmath13o@xmath0 ( @xmath13 = ti@xmath14cu ) series are very important and should be considered more rigorously beyond lsda .",
    "hence , lda+@xmath16 is applied@xcite to obtain magnetic moments and fundamental gap in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the calculations for la@xmath13o@xmath0 by solovyev _",
    "@xcite showed that the correlation correction was significant for ti , v , co but less important for mn .",
    "however , in this study the calculated intensity of the optical conductivity were found to be much smaller than the experimental results in the whole energy range .",
    "hu _ et al._@xcite reported that to get the correct experimental ground state for lamno@xmath0 , it is necessary to take jt distortion , electron - electron correlation and af ordering simultaneously into consideration . from the observation of large on - site coulomb @xmath16 and exchange @xmath17 ,",
    "obtained from `` constrained lda calculations '' , satpathy _",
    "et al._@xcite indicated the importance of correlation effects in lamno@xmath0 . held and vollhardt,@xcite using the dynamical mean - field theory , emphasize the importance of electronic correlations from the local coulomb repulsion for understanding the properties of manganites .",
    "et al._@xcite pointed out that the electron correlations remain strong even in the metallic state of doped manganites .",
    "photoemission studies on doped manganites gave an electron - electron correlation effect with @xmath16 = 7.5ev for the coulomb repulsion.@xcite    in contrast to the above observations , it has been shown that many aspects of the ground state as well as single - electron excited state properties of lamno@xmath0 and related compounds can be described satisfactorily in terms of lsda energy bands.@xcite density functional calculations also show strong couplings between lattice distortions , magnetic order , and electronic properties of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "in particular , it is found that without lattice distortions lamno@xmath0 would have a f metallic ground state , and even if forced to be a - af , it would still be metallic.@xcite further , sarma _ et al._@xcite indicated that the electron - electron correlation is unimportant due to a relatively large hopping parameter @xmath18 and a large screening effect . the lsda studies@xcite show that substantially hybridized bands derived from majority - spin mn @xmath4 and o @xmath15 states dominate the electronic structure near the fermi energy ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) data show that several apparent peaks exist up to 5ev above @xmath19 , but some disputes still remain about the origins of these conduction - band peaks.@xcite the reported positions of the @xmath20 bands in lamno@xmath0 differ.@xcite the above mentioned studies indicate that it is important to study the significance of correlation effects in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "some of the features lacking in most of the theoretical studies on lamno@xmath0 originate from the fact that they have often resulted from the use of the atomic - sphere approximation ( asa ) , i.e. the calculations have not included the nonspherical part of the potential and also used a minimal basis set .",
    "further the cubic perovskite structure is frequently assumed@xcite and the significant structural distortions are not taken into account . apart from these , owing to the presence of magnetic ordering , relativistic effects such as spin - orbit coupling may be of significance in this material , which was not been included in earlier studies .",
    "moreover , it is shown that instead of using the uniform electron gas limit for exchange and correlations ( corresponding to lsda ) one can improve the outcome by including the inhomogeneity effects through the generalized - gradient approximation ( gga).@xcite to overcome the above mentioned deficiencies we have used a generalized - gradient - corrected , relativistic full - potential method with the experimentally observed orthorhombic distorted perovskite structure as the input in the present calculation .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . the structural aspects and the computational details about the calculations of the electronic structure , energetics of different magnetic phases , optical properties , magneto - optical properties , xps and xanes features",
    "are given in sec.[sec : details ] .",
    "in sec.[sec : resdis ] we give the orbital , angular momentum and site - projected density of states ( dos ) for lamno@xmath0 in the ground state , the spin - projected dos for various magnetic state .",
    "the calculated band structure for the a - af and f phases of the distorted orthorhombic structure are given .",
    "the role of the structural distortion on the electronic structure , optical and magnetic properties is analyzed .",
    "calculated magnetic properties are compared with available experimental and theoretical studies .",
    "the origin of excited state properties such as xps , bis , xanes , optical properties and magneto - optical properties is analyzed through the electronic structure and compared with available experimental spectra . finally in sec.[sec",
    ": con ] we have summarized the important findings of the present study .",
    "lamno@xmath0 is stabilizes in the orthorhombic gdfeo@xmath0-type structure@xcite ( comprising four formula units ; space group @xmath21 ) as shown in fig.[fig : str ] .",
    "it can be viewed as a highly distorted cubic perovskite structure with a quadrupled unit cell ( @xmath22 , @xmath22 , 2@xmath23 where @xmath23 is the lattice parameter of the cubic perovskite structure .",
    "the structural parameters used in the calculations are taken from a 4.2k neutron diffraction study@xcite with @xmath24 = 5.742 , @xmath25 = 7.668 and @xmath26 = 5.532 and atom positions : la in 4c ( 0.549 0.25 0.01 ) , mn in 4a ( 0 0 0 ) , o(1 ) in 4c ( @xmath140.014 0.25 @xmath140.07 ) and o(2 ) in 8d ( 0.309 0.039 0.244 ) .",
    "the electronic configuration of mn@xmath11 in lamno@xmath0 is postulated as @xmath27 and hence , it is a typical jt system .",
    "basically , two different types of distortions are included in the structure shown in fig.[fig : str ] .",
    "one is a tilting of the mno@xmath12 octahedra around the cubic [ 110 ] axis as in gdfeo@xmath0 so that the mn - o - mn angle changes from 180@xmath28 to @xmath29 160@xmath30 which is not directly related with the jt effect , but is attributed to the relative sizes of the components , say , expressed in terms of the tolerance factor @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and r@xmath34 are the ionic radii for la , mn and o respectively giving @xmath35 = 0.947 for lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the rotation of the mno@xmath12 octahedra facilitates a more efficient space filling .",
    "the second type of crystal distortion in lamno@xmath0 is the deformation of the mno@xmath12 octahedra caused by the jt effect , viz .",
    "originating from orbital degeneracy .",
    "this may be looked upon as a cooperative shifting of the oxygens within the @xmath1 plane away from one of its two nearest neighboring mn atoms towards the others , thus creating long and short mn - o bond lengths ( modified from 1.97 for cubic case to 1.91,1.96 and 2.18 for the orthorhombic variant ) perpendicularly arranged with respect to the mn atoms .",
    "the long bonds can be regarded as rotated 90@xmath28 within @xmath1 on going from one mn to the neighboring mn.@xcite the structural optimization@xcite wrongly predicts that the ground state of lamno@xmath0 is close to that of cubic perovskite with the f state lower in energy than the experimentally observed af state .",
    "hence it is important to study the relative stability between the orthorhombic and cubic phases for different magnetic arrangements .",
    "consequently we have made calculations both for the orthorhombic ( @xmath21 ) as well as the ideal cubic perovskite variants .",
    "for the calculations of the undistorted cubic variant we have used the experimental equilibrium volume for the orthorhombic structure .",
    "when lamno@xmath0 is in the af state there are three possible magnetic arrangements according to interplane and intraplane couplings within ( 001 ) plane .",
    "( i ) with interplane af coupling and intraplane f coupling the a - af structure arises .",
    "( ii ) the opposite structure of a - af , where the interplane coupling is f , but the intraplane coupling is af is called c - af structure . in the c - type cell",
    "all atoms have two f and four af nearest neighbors whereas the reverse is true for a - type af .",
    "( iii ) if both the inter- and intraplane couplings are af the g - af structure should arise.@xcite in the g - type af lattice , each mn atom is surrounded by six mn neighbors whose spins are antiparallel to the chosen central atom . among the several possible magnetic orderings ,",
    "the experimental studies show that for lamno@xmath0 the a - af ordering is the ground state with a nel temperature of 140k . in the cubic case",
    "we have made calculations for the af structures in the following way .",
    "the a - af structure contains two formula units , and is a tetragonal lattice with @xmath24 = @xmath25 = @xmath23 and @xmath26 = 2@xmath23 .",
    "the c - af structure is also tetragonal with @xmath24 = @xmath25 = @xmath36 and @xmath26 = a@xmath37 .",
    "finally , the g - af structure is a face centered cubic structure with @xmath24 = @xmath25 = @xmath26 = 2@xmath38 with eight formula units , where two nonequivalent 3@xmath2 metals with spins up and down replace na and cl in an nacl configuration .",
    "this magnetic structure can be viewed as consisting of two interpenetrating face - centered lattices with opposite spin orientation .",
    "these investigations are based on _ ab initio _ electronic structure calculations derived from spin - polarized density - functional theory ( dft ) . for the xanes , orbital - projected dos and the screened plasma frequency calculations we have applied the full - potential linearized - augmented plane wave ( fplapw ) method@xcite in a scalar - relativistic version , i.e. without spin - orbit ( so ) coupling . in the calculation we have used the atomic sphere radii ( @xmath39 ) of 2.2 , 2.0 and 1.5 a.u . for la , mn and o , respectively . since the spin densities are well confined within a radius of about 1.5 a.u .",
    ", the resulting magnetic moments do not depend strongly on the variation of the atomic sphere radii .",
    "the charge density and the potentials are expanded into lattice harmonics up to @xmath40 = 6 inside the spheres and into a fourier series in the interstitial region .",
    "the initial basis set included 4@xmath41 , 4@xmath15 , 3@xmath2 functions and 3@xmath41 , 3@xmath15 semicore functions at the mn site , 6@xmath41 , 6@xmath15 , 5@xmath2 valence and 5@xmath41 , 5@xmath15 semicore functions for the la site and 2@xmath41 , 2@xmath15 and 3@xmath2 functions for the o site .",
    "this set of basis functions was supplemented with local orbitals for additional flexibility in representing the semicore states and for relaxing the linearization errors generally . due to the linearization errors dos",
    "are reliable to about 1@xmath142ry above the fermi level .",
    "so , after selfconsistency was achieved for this basis set we included a few high - energy local orbitals ; 6@xmath2- , 4@xmath42-like function for la , 5@xmath41- , 5@xmath15-like functions for mn and 3@xmath15-like functions for o atoms .",
    "the effects of exchange and correlation are treated within the generalized - gradient - corrected local spin - density approximation using the parameterization scheme of perdew _",
    "et al._@xcite to ensure convergence for the brillouin zone ( bz ) integration 243*k * points in the irreducible wedge of first bz were used .",
    "self - consistency was achieved by demanding the convergence of the total energy to be smaller than 10@xmath43ry / cell .",
    "this corresponds to a convergence of the charge below 10@xmath44 electrons / atom .",
    "the full - potential lmto calculations@xcite presented in this paper are all electron , and no shape approximation to the charge density or potential has been used .",
    "the base geometry in this computational method consists of a muffin - tin part and an interstitial part .",
    "the basis set is comprised of augmented linear muffin - tin orbitals.@xcite inside the muffin - tin spheres the basis functions , charge density and potential are expanded in symmetry - adapted spherical harmonic functions together with a radial function and a fourier series in the interstitial . in the present calculations the spherical - harmonic expansion of the charge density , potential and basis functions were carried out up to @xmath40 = 6 .",
    "the tails of the basis functions outside their parent spheres are linear combinations of hankel or neumann functions depending on the sign of the kinetic energy of the basis function in the interstitial region . for the core charge density",
    ", the dirac equation is solved self - consistently , i.e. no frozen core approximation is used .",
    "the calculations are based on the generalized - gradient - corrected - density - functional theory as proposed by perdew _",
    "et al._@xcite    the so term is included directly in the hamiltonian matrix elements for the part inside the muffin - tin spheres , thus doubling the size of the secular matrix for a spin - polarized calculation .",
    "even though the la @xmath45 states are well above @xmath19 their contribution to the magnetic and structural properties are very important.@xcite",
    "so we have included these orbitals in all our calculations .",
    "moreover , the present calculations make use of a so - called multibasis , to ensure a well converged wave function .",
    "this means that we use different hankel or neuman functions each attaching to its own radial function .",
    "we thus have two @xmath46 , two @xmath47 , two 6@xmath15 , two 5@xmath2 and two 4@xmath42 orbitals for la , two @xmath48 , two @xmath47 and three 3@xmath2 orbitals for mn , two @xmath49 , three @xmath50 and two @xmath51 orbitals for o in our expansion of the wave function . in the method used here , bases corresponding to multiple principal quantum numbers are contained within a single , fully hybridizing basis set .",
    "the direction of the moment is chosen to be ( 001 ) .",
    "the calculations were performed for the cubic perovskite structure as well as the orthorhombic gdfeo@xmath0-type structure in nonmagnetic ( p ) , f , a - af , c - af and g - af states .",
    "the * k*-space integration was performed using the special point method with 284 * k * points in the irreducible part of first bz for the orthorhombic structure and the same density of * k * points were used for the cubic structure in the actual cell as well as the supercell .",
    "all calculations were performed using the experimental structural parameters mentioned in sec.[ssec : str ] for both the nonmagnetic and spin - polarized cases . using the self - consistent potentials obtained from our calculations ,",
    "the imaginary part of the optical dielectric tensor and the band structure of lamno@xmath0 were calculated for the a - af and f cases .",
    "the density of states were calculated for the p , f , a - af , c - af and g - af phases in the cubic as well as orthorhombic structure using the linear tetrahedron technique .",

    "the calculations yield unbroadened functions . to reproduce the experimental conditions more correctly ,",
    "it is necessary to broaden the calculated spectra .",
    "the exact form of the broadening function is unknown , although comparison with measurements suggests that the broadening usually increases with increasing excitation energy .",
    "also the instrumental resolution smears out many fine features . to simulate these effects",
    "the lifetime broadening was simulated by convoluting the absorptive part of the dielectric function with a lorentzian , whose full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is equal to @xmath70ev .",
    "the experimental resolution was simulated by broadening the final spectra with a gaussian , where fwhm is equal to 0.02 ev .",
    "the magneto - optic effect can be described by the off - diagonal elements of the dielectric tensor which originate from optical transitions with a different frequency dependence of right and left circularly polarized light because of so splitting of the states involved . for the polar geometry , the kerr - rotation ( @xmath71 ) and ellipticity ( @xmath72 ) are related to the optical conductivity through the following relation : @xmath73 where @xmath74 in terms of conductivities are @xmath75 for small kerr - angles , eq .

    "the total dos is shown in fig.[fig : ctdos ] for the nonmagnetic ( paramagnetic = p ) , f and the a- , c- and g- type af spin configurations . without the jt - caused lattice distortion ,",
    "the lsda calculations show that lamno@xmath0 is metallic for all these magnetic states . in all the cooperative magnetic states ,",
    "the hund splitting is large and induces an empty minority - spin band at the mn site .",
    "the dos for the p phase given in fig.[fig : ctdos ] shows a large value at @xmath19 .",
    "this is a favorable condition for providing a magnetic splitting and hence the cooperative magnetic phase is more stable than the p phase . from dos",
    "for the f state of the undistorted structure ( see fig.[fig : ctdos ] ) one can see that there is a finite number of states present in both spin channels . on the other hand the half - metallic character clearly appeared in the f state of the orthorhombic structure ( fig.[fig : tdos ] ) .",
    "the different hybridization nature of the cubic and the orthorhombic phases and the noninvolvement of jt effects in the cubic phase are the possible reasons for the absence of the half - metallic character in the cubic phase .",
    "the total dos of the af phases are much different from that of the f phase ( fig.[fig : ctdos ] ) . owing to large exchange splitting",
    "there is a smaller dos at the fermi level [ @xmath116 for the f and af phases compared with the p phase .",

    "let us now focus on the role of the structural distortion on the electronic structure of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "it is believed that lamno@xmath0 is a charge - transfer - type ( ct ) insulator@xcite according to the zaanen - sawatzky - allen scheme,@xcite in which the lowest - lying gap transition corresponds to the ct excitation from the o 2@xmath15 to mn 3@xmath2 state and has four @xmath2 electrons per mn@xmath11 site with a configuration of @xmath118 .",
    "this electronic configuration with one electron for the two @xmath4 orbitals implies that lamno@xmath0 is a typical jt system .",
    "so , this electronic configuration is susceptible to a strong electron - phonon coupling of the jt type that splits the @xmath4 states into filled @xmath119 and empty @xmath120 , and thus , produces large asymmetric oxygen displacements .",
    "the important factors governing the formation of the electronic structure of orthorhombic lamno@xmath0 are the exchange splitting owing to spin polarization , the ligand field splitting of @xmath121 and @xmath3 states and the further splitting of the @xmath121 states owing to the jt distortion .",
    "early theoretical work focused on the undistorted perovskite aristotype structure and it was found that usual lsda can not produce the correct insulating ground state for lamno@xmath0.@xcite using the lapw method , pickett and singh@xcite obtained a gap of 0.12ev for the distorted lamno@xmath0 when they include the jt effect and a - af ordering .    as noticed in earlier studies,@xcite two unexpected behaviors",
    "appear when one includes the structural distortion ; the stabilization of the a - af over the f phase and an opening of a gap and large rearrangement of bands .",
    "the valence band dos of lamno@xmath0 are derived primarily from mn 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath15 admixture with dominant mn 3@xmath2 character ( fig.[fig : pdos ] ) . from the projected density of states ( pdos )",
    "it can be seen that the mn 3@xmath2 @xmath14 o 2@xmath15 hybridization is spin dependent . for the case of the majority - spin channel both mn 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath15 strongly mix with each other in the whole vb . on the contrary , owing to the presence of mn 3@xmath2 in the high spin state , the minority - spin vb is nearly empty for the mn 3@xmath2 states .",
    "hence , there is little overlap between mn 3@xmath2 and o 2@xmath15 states in the minority - spin channel .",
    "because of ct from la and mn to the o 2@xmath15 states , the latter are almost filled and their contribution to the unoccupied state is minimal .",
    "the o 2@xmath41 states are well localized and are present around @xmath1418ev .",
    "vb of lamno@xmath0 is generally composed of four regions .",
    "the lowest energy region contains mainly o 2@xmath41 bands , above this the la 5@xmath15 bands are distributed in the region between @xmath1417ev and @xmath1414ev .",
    "both the o 2@xmath41 and la 5@xmath15 bands are well separated from the bands in the vicinity of @xmath19 , and consequently they hardly contribute to the chemical bonding or to transport properties .",
    "the o 2@xmath15 bands are present in the energy range @xmath147ev to @xmath142ev and energetically degenerate with the mn 3@xmath2 states in the whole vb region indicating covalent interaction between mn and o in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the present observation of strong covalency in the ground state of lamno@xmath0 is consistent with the conclusion drawn from photoemission and x - ray - absorption spectroscopy.@xcite the negligible contribution of la electrons in the vb region indicates that there is an ionic interaction between la and the mno@xmath12 octahedra .",
    "it has been pointed out by goodenough@xcite that the covalency between the a site and oxygen is important for the gdfeo@xmath0-type distortion .",
    "however our pdos profile shows that there is only a negligible amount of electrons present in vb from the a ( la ) site indicating that the covalent interaction between la and o is rather unimportant in lamno@xmath0 . from pdos along with the orbital - projected dos",
    "we see that both mn @xmath3 and @xmath4 electrons participate in the covalent interaction with the neighboring oxygens .",
    "the top of vb is dominated by the majority - spin mn 3@xmath2 states indicating the importance of mn 3@xmath2 states in transport properties such as cmr observed in hole - doped lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the bottom of cb is dominated by the minority - spin mn 3@xmath2 electrons and above the la 4@xmath42 electrons are present in a very narrow energy range between 2.6 and 3.5ev ( fig.[fig : pdos ] ) .",
    "o 3@xmath2 and mn 4@xmath15 states are found around 10ev above @xmath19 . as the mn @xmath2 states are playing an important role for the magnetism and other physical properties of lamno@xmath0 , it is worthwhile to investigate these in more detail .",
    "an approximately cubic crystal field stemming from the oxygen octahedron around mn would split the mn 3@xmath2 levels into @xmath3 and @xmath4 levels . for mn@xmath11 in lamno@xmath0 , three electrons would occupy localized @xmath3 levels , and one electron a linear combination of two @xmath4 levels .",
    "the general view of the electronic structure of lamno@xmath0 is that both @xmath3 and e@xmath113 orbitals hybridize with o 2@xmath15 orbitals , @xmath3 mainly with 2@xmath15 @xmath122 and @xmath4 mainly with 2@xmath15 @xmath123 .",
    "the @xmath3 electrons hybridize less with o 2@xmath15 states and hence may be viewed as local spins ( @xmath124 = 3/2 ) .",
    "in contrast to that , @xmath121 orbitals , which hybridize more strongly produce rather broad bands . the strong exchange interaction with the @xmath125 subbands along with",
    "the jt distortion lead to the splitting of @xmath4 into half occupied @xmath114 and unoccupied @xmath126 bands .",
    "our calculations show that @xmath3 bands forms intense peaks in both vb and cb , and majority - spin @xmath3 bands are almost completely filled owing to the high spin state of mn in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "contrary to the general opinion , our orbital projected dos ( fig.[fig : ldos ] ) show that both @xmath4 and @xmath3 electrons are present throughout vb and hence both types of electrons participate in the covalent bonding with oxygen .",
    "the orbital projected dos ( fig.[fig : ldos ] ) clearly shows that there is almost equal amounts of both @xmath4 and @xmath3 electrons at the top of vb and certainly not@xcite dominated by mn @xmath4 bands alone .",
    "the dos in fig.[fig : ldos ] @xmath119 states are shifted to a lower energy than @xmath120 and is more populated .",
    "a comparison of the orbital projected dos for the mn @xmath2 states of the f cubic phase with that of the af orthorhombic phase show significant differences . in the f cubic case the @xmath4 levels are well separated from the @xmath3 levels and there is no @xmath125 electrons present in the vicinity of @xmath19 . in the a - af orthorhombic phase",
    "both @xmath125 and @xmath114 electrons are present in the vicinity of @xmath19 .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath3 electrons are energetically degenerate throughout the vb range and in particular the electrons in the @xmath119 orbitals are well localized and degenerate with the electrons in @xmath127 and @xmath128 .",
    "importantly , the jt distortion split the @xmath4 states in the a - af orthorhombic phase and hence we find semiconducting behavior .",
    "photoemission studies@xcite show that the character of the bandgap of lamno@xmath0 is of the @xmath15-to-@xmath2 ct type .",
    "our site projected doss predict that there is considerable @xmath15 and @xmath2 character present at the top of vb as well as in the low energy region of cb .",
    "the vb photoemission study@xcite has been interpreted to suggest that dos closer to @xmath19 in vb contains contributions from mn @xmath114 .",
    "in contrast , our calculations ( fig.[fig : ldos ] ) show that dos closer to @xmath19 in vb contains contribution from both mn @xmath114 and @xmath125 electrons .    owing to the jt distortion",
    "the @xmath4 electrons are subjected to an oo effect in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "as the jt distortion influences the stability of the orbital configuration , one can expect that it also should affect the electronic structure of lamno@xmath0 differently for different magnetic orderings .",
    "hence , we next focus our attention to the electronic structure of orthorhombic lamno@xmath0 in different magnetic configurations . the calculated total dos for orthorhombic lamno@xmath0 in the p , f and a- , c- and g - af arrangements are shown in fig.[fig : tdos ] . from dos at @xmath19 in the p phase , one can deduce pertinent information concerning the magnetism in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "this shows that lamno@xmath0 is a very favorable compound for cooperative magnetism since it has a large dos value at @xmath19 in the p state ( fig.[fig : tdos ] ) .",
    "owing to the splitting of @xmath4 states by the jt distortion , a gap opens up @xmath19 in doss for both the a - af and g - af phases ( fig.[fig : tdos ] ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the cubic phase of lamno@xmath0 is always metallic irrespective of the magnetic ordering considered in the calculations .",
    "thus the structural distortion is the key ingredient to account for the stabilization of the insulating behavior of lamno@xmath0 , consistent with the earlier studies.@xcite from fig.[fig : tdos ] it is interesting to note that the p , f and c - af phases of lamno@xmath0 are found to exhibit metallic conduction even when we include the structural distortions in the calculation .",
    "this shows that apart from structural distortion , the af ordering also plays and important role for stabilizing the insulating behavior of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "usually , the @xmath4 splitting caused by the jt effect is somewhat underestimated in the asa calculations@xcite and a discrepancy could reflect an uncertainty introduced by the asa approach . the energy separation between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 levels , caused by the crystal - field splitting ,",
    "is known to be larger than 1ev.@xcite owing to strong overlap between the @xmath4 and @xmath3 levels in the a - af orthorhombic phase , we are unable to estimate the crystal field splitting energy . however , owing to the well separated @xmath4 and @xmath3 levels in the cubic phase we estimated this energy to be @xmath290.96ev .",
    "the jt distortion lifts the degeneracy of the @xmath4 level .",
    "the @xmath4 level splitting in our calculation is found to be 0.278ev and this is nothing but the ( semiconducting ) bandgap in this material .",
    "the mn @xmath2 exchange splitting obtained from our calculation is 3.34ev and this is found to be in agreement with 3.5ev found by pickett and singh@xcite by a lapw calculation and 3.48ev reported by mahadevan _",
    "et al._@xcite from lmto - asa calculations .",
    "the lmto - asa@xcite calculations reveals that the splittings between the spin - up and spin - down states on introduction of the orthorhombic distortion are slightly asymmetric for the two types of mn .",
    "however , our more accurate full potential calculations do not show any asymmetry of the splitting and the magnetic moments are completely canceled due to the af interaction between the mn ions .",
    "the total dos in fig.[fig : tdos ] show clearly that there is a gap opening near @xmath19 in the g - af phase with a value of 0.28ev , comparable with that of the a - af phase . as there is no bandgap in the c - af and f phases ,",
    "the above results indicate that the af coupling between the layers plays an important role in opening up the bandgap in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the dos for the f phase shows a half - metallic feature , viz . , the finite total dos around @xmath19 comes from one of the spin channels while there is a gap across @xmath19 for the other spin channel .",
    "both spin - up and spin - down e@xmath113 states extend over a wide energy range . owing to the f ordering within the @xmath1 plane in the a - af phase and within @xmath129 in the c - af phase , the dos for these phases bears resemblance to that of the f phase .",
    "on the other hand , dos for the g - af phase ( dominated by the af superexchange interactions ) is quite different from that of the a- , c - af and the f phases ( fig.[fig : tdos ] ) .",
    "moreover , in the g - af phase the width of the @xmath4 state is narrower than that in the a- , c - af and f phases and the partially filled @xmath4 states in these phases are well separated from the empty @xmath3 states .      as the jt coupling between the @xmath4 electrons and the distortion modes for the mno@xmath12 octahedra plays an important role for the physical properties of lamno@xmath0 ,",
    "a magnetic - property study of the undistorted cubic phase of lamno@xmath0 is important .",
    "we have calculated the total energies and magnetic moments for lamno@xmath0 in the undistorted cubic perovskite structure as well as for the orthorhombic structure with different magnetic configurations .",
    "the calculated total energies for the p , f , a- , c- and g - af states of lamno@xmath0 with the cubic perovskite structure relative to the a - af phase with the orthorhombic structure is given in table[table : de ] .",
    "according to these data the cubic phase of lamno@xmath0 should be stabilized in the f phase .",
    "stabilization of the f phase in the cubic structure concurs with earlier findings.@xcite the lapw calculations of hamada _",
    "et al._@xcite for undistorted lamno@xmath0 show that the a - af phase is 1ev above the f phase , whereas pickett and singh@xcite found a difference of only 110mev .",
    "our calculations shows that the a - af phase is 60mev above the f phase in the cubic perovskite structure ( table[table : de ] ) .",
    "we used gga , so coupling and a large number of * k * points along with a well converged basis set .",
    "this may account for the difference between the present work and the earlier studies .",
    "our orbital projected dos for the @xmath2 electrons of mn ( fig.[fig : cldos ] ) show that the @xmath4 electrons are only distributed in the vicinity of @xmath19 in the majority - spin channel .",
    "the removal of the jt distortion enhances the exchange interaction originating from the @xmath4 states drastically and also reduces the negative exchange from the @xmath3 state .",
    "hence , the total interplane exchange interaction is positive and the system stabilizes in the f phase .",
    "the calculated total energies of various magnetic configurations for lamno@xmath0 in the orthorhombic structure ( table[table : de ] ) shows that the orthorhombic structure with the a - af ordering of the moments is the ground state for lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the stabilization of the a - af state is consistent with the neutron diffraction findings.@xcite further , our calculations predict that the f phase is only 24mev higher in energy than the ground state . on the other hand ,",
    "the p phase is @xmath291.4ev higher in energy than the ground state . from the total energy of the various possible magnetic arrangements it is clear that intralayer exchange interactions in lamno@xmath0 are f and considerably stronger than the af interlayer couplings , the latter being very sensitive to lattice distortions .",
    "this observation is in agreement with the conclusion of terakura _",
    "et al._@xcite from electronic structure studies and in qualitative agreement with inelastic neutron scattering results.@xcite the present observation of a small energy difference between the a - af and f phases is consistent with earlier theoretical studies.@xcite it should be noted that lmto - asa calculations@xcite predict the f state to be lower in energy than the af state also for the orthorhombic structure ( table[table : de ] ) .",
    "however , the lsda+@xmath16 calculations@xcite with lattice distortion yielded the correct ground state .",
    "hence , it has been concluded that the correlation effect plays an important role for obtaining the correct electronic structure of lamno@xmath0 .",
    "it should also be noted that the theoretically optimized crystal - structure theory predicts@xcite that f is more stable than the observed a - af state in lamno@xmath0 . on the other hand , our calculations , without the inclusion of the correlation effect , give the correct ground state for lamno@xmath0 indicating that the correlation effect is not so important in this case .",
    "if the interlayer f coupling is stronger than the intralayer af coupling the system will be stabilized in the c - af phase .",
    "however , our calculations show that c - af phase is higher in energy than the a - af and f phases . due to the jt instability of mn @xmath130",
    ", a substantial energy gain is expected when we include the actual structural distortions in our calculations .",
    "hence , a gain of 0.323ev / f.u . is found for f and 0.407ev / f.u . for a - af",
    "( table[table : de ] ) when the structural distortions were included .",
    "the magnetic ordering is such that the difference in total energy between f and a - af ( c - af ) give information about the exchange - coupling energy within the plane ( perpendicular to the plane for c - af ) .",
    "our calculations show that the af intraplane exchange interaction energy is smaller ( 24mev for the orthorhombic phase and 59mev for the cubic phase ) than the af interplane exchange interaction energy ( 41mev for the orthorhombic phase and 92mev for the cubic phase ) .",
    "the present findings are consistent with the experimental studies in the sense that neutron scattering measurements@xcite on a lamno@xmath0 single crystal showed a strong intraplane f coupling and a weak af interplane coupling .",
    "now we will try to understand the microscopic origin for the stabilization of a - af in lamno@xmath0 . in the ideal cubic lattice the hybridization between the mn @xmath3 and @xmath4 states is nearly vanishing .",
    "as expected for a half - filled @xmath3 band , the @xmath3-type interatomic exchange facilitates af ordering .",
    "our orbital - projected dos show that the @xmath120 electrons are distributed in the whole vb region and are mainly populated in the top of vb .",
    "the jt distortion induces orbital ordering in which the orbitals confined to the @xmath1 plane ( @xmath131 and @xmath6 ) are dominantly populated and the counter @xmath4 orbitals of @xmath119 symmetry are less populated in the vicinity of @xmath19 . in this case itinerant band ferromagnetism is operational in the @xmath1 plane and is responsible for the f ordering with in the plane .",
    "the electrons in the @xmath127 and @xmath119 orbitals are well localized and these make the interplane exchange interaction af , which in turn stabilizes the a - af phase . however , the electrons in the @xmath128 orbitals are well delocalized and have almost the same energy distribution as @xmath120 .",
    "this weakens the af coupling between the layers and in turn makes the energy difference between the f and a - af phases very small . the cmr effect in manganites",
    "may be understood as follows .",
    "when charges are localized by strong electron - electron interactions the system becomes an af insulator , but this state is energetically very close to the metallic f state in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "consequently , aligning of spins with an external magnetic field will activate the metallic f states and cause a large gain of kinetic energy , i.e. a cmr phenomenon .",
    "table[table : moment ] lists the calculated magnetic moment at the mn site in lamno@xmath0 for different spin configurations in the undistorted cubic perovskite structure as well as the distorted orthorhombic structure , including for comparison corresponding values from other theoretical studies and experimental neutron diffraction results . without hybridization ,",
    "the mn spin moment should take an appropriate integer value ( 4@xmath132/mn atom in the case of high spin state ) and the oxygen moment should be negligible . owing to the covalent interaction between the mn @xmath2 and o @xmath15 states , experimental as well as theoretical studies will give smaller mn moments than predicted by the ionic model .",
    "for the f phase in the orthorhombic structure , mn polarizes the neighboring oxygens and the induced moment at the o(1 ) site is 0.07@xmath132/atom and at the o(2 ) 0.059@xmath132/atom and these moments are coupled ferromagnetically with the local moments of mn@xmath11 .",
    "there are small differences in the magnetic moments for the different magnetic arrangements indicating that these moments have a distinct atomic - like character . from table[table : moment ] it should be noted that the lmto - asa approach generally gives larger moments than the accurate full - potential calculation .",
    "the reason for this difference is that the full - potential calculations estimate the moments using the spin density within the muffin - tin spheres so that the spin - density in the interstitial region is neglected .",
    "our calculated magnetic moment at the mn site in the a - af orthorhombic structure is comparable with the experimental value ( table[table : moment ] ) .",
    "the electric field gradient for mn in the f phase obtained by the flapw calculation is 3.579 @xmath133 10@xmath134 v / m@xmath135 as compared with @xmath141.587 @xmath133 10@xmath134 v / m@xmath135 for the a - af phase .",

    "a comment on the appearence of the f state by doping of divalent elements in lamno@xmath0 is appropriate .",
    "it has long been believed that the appearence of the f ground sate in metallic la@xmath7_ae_@xmath8mno@xmath0 can be explained by the double - exchange interaction of mn@xmath11 ( @xmath138 ) and mn@xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) .",
    "recent experiments and theoretical investigations have revealed many discrepancies in the simple double - exchange model .",

    "millis _ et al._@xcite proposed that in addition to the double - exchange mechanism , a strong electron - phonon interaction arising from the jt splitting of the outer mn @xmath2 level is important .",

    "if the double - exchange mechanism is operational in lamno@xmath0 one can expect a charge imbalance between the mn atoms in the @xmath1 plane ( with f alignment ) this suggests that the f coupling in lamno@xmath0 can be explained within the frame work of itinerant band ferromagnetism .",

    "the sign of @xmath149 is thus directly related to the spin polarization of the electronic states that contributes to the mo effect .",
    "owing to the half - metallic behavior of the f state of lamno@xmath0 the off - diagonal components of the dielectric tensor below 2.46ev originates only from the majority - spin electrons ( see fig.[fig : e2 ] ) .",
    "so , the peaks at 0.4 , 0.9 and 2ev in the kerr - rotation spectra stem from transition from mn @xmath150 to the hybridized mn@xmath14o mn(@xmath151o 2@xmath15)@xmath152 bands . the experimental @xmath149 spectra show@xcite two peaks , one at 1.2ev and the other at 3.5ev .",
    "these two peaks are assigned to be @xmath153 transitions involving @xmath154 minority - spin electrons .",
    "electrons , respectively .",
    "the absence of the 3.5ev peak in our theoretical spectra indicate that it is an effect of the hole - doping .",

    "the discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical kerr - spectra in the higher - energy region may be explained as a temperature and/or hole doping effect .",

    "et al._@xcite have performed theoretical calculation on mo properties such as kerr - rotation and ellipticity for lamno@xmath0 for different canted - spin configurations .",
    "as the f state is only 24mev above the ground state , it is quite possible that the f state can be stabilized experimentally .",

    "a deeper understanding of optical properties is important from a fundamental point of view , since the optical characteristics involves not only the occupied and unoccupied part of the electronic structure but also the character of the bands .",
    "so , in order to compare the band structure of lamno@xmath0 directly with experimental facts@xcite we have calculated the optical spectra for lamno@xmath0 ( for earlier theoretical studies see refs . ) .",
    "the experimental reflectivity spectra are rather confusing and controversial ( see the discussion in ref . ) .",
    "recent experiments@xcite indicate that the optical spectrum of the manganites is very sensitive to the condition at the surface .",
    "as the optical properties of materials originate from interband transitions from occupied to unoccupied bands it is more instructive to turn to the electronic energy - band structure .",

    "( it should be noted however that optical gaps are usually defined at the onset of an increase in spectral intensity in the measured optical variable . )",

    "the lsda and lsda+@xmath16 calculations of yang _",

    "as all the linear optical properties can be derived from @xmath162 we have illustrated this quantity in fig.[fig : e2 ] and we have compared our theoretical spectra with the experimental @xmath162 spectra derived from reflectivity measurements .",
    "the illustration shows that our calculated spectra are in good agreement with the experimental data at least up to 20ev .",
    "this indicates that unlike earlier reported @xmath55 spectra obtained from asa calculations@xcite , accurate full - potential calculations are able to predict the electronic structure of lamno@xmath0 reliably not only for the occupied states but also for the excited states .",
    "it is interesting to note that we are able to predict correctly the peaks around 1.5 , 4.7 , 8.8 and 20ev without the introduction of so - called scissor operations .",
    "this suggests that electron - correlation effects are less significant in lamno@xmath0 .",
    "the peak around 4.7ev is reasonably close to the experimental feature reported by of arima _",
    "et al._@xcite ( fig.[fig : e2 ] ) .",
    "our theoretical peak at 8.8ev in the spectra is in quantitative agreement with both sets of experimental data included in the figure .",

    "et al._@xcite failed to record ) .",
    "now we will try to understand the microscopic origin of the optical interband transitions in lamno@xmath0 .",

    "note that such @xmath164 transitions are not allowed by the electric dipole selection rule , but it has been suggested@xcite that a strong hybridization of the @xmath4 bands with the o 2@xmath15 bands will make such @xmath164 transitions optically active .",
    "the interband transition between jt split bands gives low - energy transitions in the @xmath162 spectra and the sharp peak features present in @xmath165 and @xmath166 are attributed to such interband transition .",
    "the partial dos for lamno@xmath0 given in fig.[fig : pdos ] show that there is a considerable amount of o 2@xmath15 states present at the top of vb as well as at the bottom of cb arising from strong covalent interaction between mn @xmath2 and o @xmath15 states .",
    "hence , we propose that the lower energy peak in the @xmath167 spectra originates from [ ( mn @xmath120 @xmath128;o @xmath15 hybridized ) @xmath168 ( mn @xmath2;o @xmath15 ) ] optical interband transition .",

    "<S> consistent with earlier observations the insulating behavior can be obtained only when we take into account the structural distortions and the correct antiferromagnetic ordering in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the present results suggest that the correlation effect is not significant in lamno@xmath0 and the presence of ferromagnetic coupling within the @xmath1 plane as well as the antiferromagnetic coupling perpendicular to this plane can be explained through the itinerant band picture . as against earlier expectations , </S>",

    "<S> in particular significantly large amounts of @xmath3 electrons are present in combination with the @xmath4 electrons at the top of the valence band against the common expectation of presence of only pure @xmath4 electrons . </S>",
