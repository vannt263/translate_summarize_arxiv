    "recently layered rare - earth antimonides have been attracting wide attention due to their possible relationship to superconductivity , charge density wave ( cdw ) and colossal magnetoresistance ( mr).@xcite for example , two - dimensional superconductivity ( @xmath1 k ) was observed in lasb@xmath0 under ambient pressure , while application of hydrostatic pressure induces a two- to three - dimensional superconducting crossover.@xcite large positive magnetoresistance was observed in lasb@xmath0 and laagsb@xmath0.@xcite lasb@xmath0 exhibits a large linear magnetoresistance with no sign of saturation up to 45 t fields and @xmath2.@xcite mr in laagsb@xmath0 is also linear and reaches @xmath3 in 18 t field.@xcite the resistivity of laagsb@xmath0 exhibits a significant anomaly at @xmath4k which was attributed to the possible cdw transition.@xcite very large magnetothermopower effects were observed in laagsb@xmath0.@xcite the magnetoresistance and magnetothermopower effects in these materials are extraordinary and are still poorly understood .",

    "one of the other mechanisms for linear mr is the quantum limit in high magnetic field.@xcite application of strong magnetic field ( @xmath29 ) results in quantized landau levels @xmath46 ( lls ) .",
    "when the field is very large and the difference between the zeroth and first landau level @xmath47 exceeds the fermi energy @xmath48 and the thermal fluctuation @xmath49 , all carriers only occupy the lowest ll and a large linear mr could be expected : @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the density of scattering centers , @xmath52 is the carrier density , @xmath53 is the fermi velocity at the dirac cones , and @xmath54 is the high frequency dielectric constant.@xcite for electrons with conventional parabolic bands , @xmath55 and its evolution with field is very slow because of the large effective mass @xmath56 .",
    "then it is impossible to observe quantum limit and linear mr behavior in the moderate field range ( below 9 t ) .",
    "unusual linear magnetoresistance in low temperature range was identified in some materials hosting dirac fermions with linear energy dispersion , such as ag@xmath8(te / se ) , topological insulators and bafe@xmath0as@xmath0.@xcite for dirac states with linear energy dispersion , the energy splitting between the lowest and @xmath7 lls is described by @xmath57 where @xmath53 is the fermi velocity .",
    "it increases rapidly with field because of the large fermi velocity of dirac fermions .",

    "the crystal structure of laagsb@xmath0 has quasi - two - dimensional sb layers similar to the double - sized bi square nets in srmnbi@xmath0 .",
    "it could be expected that the sb layers in laagsb@xmath0 can also host dirac fermions .",
    "the band structure in fig .",
    "1(d ) shows two nearly linear narrow bands crossing the fermi level along @xmath15 and @xmath17 directions .",
    "the fermi level is located very close to the dirac - cone - like points .",
    "quantum oscillation experiments revealed the hollow cylindrical fermi surface in laagsb@xmath0 and very small effective mass ( @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the mass of bare electron).@xcite these results suggest that the unusual linear mr would originate from the quantum limit of dirac fermions . in ref.[31 ] , theoretical calculation predicted a very small pocket which has 20 t oscillation frequency and very small effective mass @xmath34 0.06@xmath60 , although it was not observed in the experiment .",
    "our first principle result is consistent with this . besides , another quantum oscillation measurement @xcite reports even smaller sdh oscillation frequencies @xmath34 10 t and 80 t in laagsb@xmath0 .",
    "these indicate possible small dirac pockets in the system .",
    "most likely the quantum limit and linear mr is related to these very small pockets .",
    "taking the linear mr induced by quantum limit into account and combing eqn.(1 ) and eqn.(2 ) , mr in laagsb@xmath0 can be described very well by @xmath61 with @xmath62 as the fitting parameters.@xcite the fitting curves for low temperature ( @xmath63 30 k ) and higher temperature ( @xmath64 30 k ) are shown in fig .",

    "the critical condition to achieve quantum limit at finite temperature is @xmath67 and then the critical field @xmath31 for dirac fermions is @xmath68.@xcite for conventional electron gas with parabolic bands @xmath31 is proportional to temperature .",

    "the fitting gives a large fermi velocity @xmath69 ms@xmath70 .",
    "the mobility of the system can be inferred from the semiclassical transport behavior in low field region . for a multiband system ,",
    "the coefficient of the low - field semiclassical @xmath45 quadratic term , @xmath71 , is related to the the effective electron and hole conductivity ( @xmath72 ) and mobility ( @xmath73 ) through @xmath74 , which is smaller than the average mobility of carriers @xmath75 and gives an estimate of the lower bound to the latter.@xcite fig .",
    "5(b ) shows the dependence of @xmath43 on the temperature . at 2 k ,",
    "the value of @xmath43 is about 4000 @xmath76/vs in laagsb@xmath0 which is larger than the values in conventional metals and semiconductors .",
    "the parabolic temperature dependence of @xmath31 and the large @xmath43 confirms the existence of dirac fermion states in laagsb@xmath0 .",
    "another possible reason of the evolution of the crossover field @xmath31 is the dependence of the carrier density and mobility .",
    "although there is temperature evolution of the carrier density and mobility , dirac fermions dominate the mr behavior and the large linear mr should be only due to the quantum limit of dirac fermions . the temperature evolution of carriers should only influence the curve shape in the semiclassical transport region and the magnitude of the quantum linear mr since the quantum linear mr only depends on the dirac fermions density .",
    "in fact the decrease of mr with temperature increasing should be attributed to the decrease of dirac carriers .",
    "but the crossover point from semiclassical transport region to quantum transport region should not be influenced by this temperature evolution of carrier density / mobility but by the thermal fluctuation smearing out the ll splitting .",
    "another possibility for linear mr is the breakdown of weak - field magnetotransport at a simple density - wave quantum critical point.@xcite quasi - linear mr was also found in sr@xmath0ruo@xmath23 @xcite and ca@xmath77ru@xmath0o@xmath78.@xcite both of them are argued to be a small gap density wave system with quasi-2d fermi surface .",
    "theoretical analysis pointed out that at a simple density - wave quantum critical point the weak - field regime of magnetotransport collapses to zero - field with the size of gap.@xcite laagsb@xmath0 also exhibits cdw transition at @xmath79 k and the linear mr disappears around the cdw temperature .",
    "so the linear mr or the dirac fermions should be related to the cdw order .",
    "similar phenomena was observed in bafe@xmath0as@xmath0 , in which the linear mr disappears above the spin density wave ( sdw ) temperature and the formation of dirac fermions was attributed to the nodes of the sdw gap by complex zone folding in bands with different parities.@xcite the detail mechanism of linear mr , the existence of dirac fermion , as well as the relationship between dirac fermions and cdw in laagsb@xmath0 deserve further study using direct methods such as the angular resolved photoelectron spectroscopy ( arpes ) .    ) dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath80 ( a ) and seebeck coefficient @xmath81 ( b ) at different temperatures .",

    "the magnetic field also has significant influence on the thermal transport of laagsb@xmath0 ( fig .",
    "2(b ) and ( c ) ) .",
    "magnetic field suppresses thermal conductivity significantly below 200 k due to the large mr .",
    "6(a ) and ( b ) show the magnetic field dependence of the hall resistivity @xmath80 and seebeck coefficient @xmath81 at different temperatures respectively .",
    "the behavior in @xmath80 is different from the classical hall behavior .",
    "the positive @xmath80 are not linear in field but quadratic .",
    "the hall resistivity curves all cross at @xmath82 t. below 2 t @xmath80 increases with increase in temperature , while it decreases with increase in temperature above 2 t. this indicates the change in the apparent carrier density @xmath86 .",
    "6(c ) shows the temperature dependence of @xmath87 at several magnetic fields . at 2 k ,",
    "the apparent carrier density at 1 t is reduced by a half in 9 t field , implying the suppression of the dos .",
    "this also induces the suppression of thermal conductivity in field ( fig .",
    "more interestingly , @xmath87 increases with increase in temperature below 2 t while it decreases with increase in temperature for fields larger than 2 t. in zero field , seebeck coefficient is negative in the whole temperature range . for magnetic field dependence of @xmath81 ( fig .",
    "6(b ) ) , the absolute value decreases linearly with increase in magnetic field below 2 t. it becomes zero at about 2 t when temperature is below 30 k. further increase in field induces the changes of the sign of seebeck coefficient from negative to positive and then the magnitude increases with increase in field .    in a single band metal with diffusion mechanism and electron - type carriers ,",
    "seebeck coefficient is given by the mott relatioship , @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the dos , @xmath90 is the fermi energy , @xmath91 is the boltzman constant and @xmath92 is the absolute value of electronic charge.@xcite the electron contribution to seebeck coefficient @xmath93 is usually negative while the hole contribution @xmath94 is always positive.@xcite for a two - band metal comprising electron and hole bands , @xmath81 is expressed as @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are the contributions of electrons ( holes ) to the electric conductivity and seebeck coefficient , respectively . according to the classical expression for the hall coefficient including both electron and hole type carriers,@xcite @xmath98 where @xmath92 is the electron charge , @xmath99 and @xmath100 represent the carrier concentrations and mobilities of the electrons ( holes ) .",
    "once there are two carrier types present , the field dependence of @xmath101 will become nonlinear .",
    "moreover , eq . ( 2 ) gives @xmath102 , when @xmath103 0 , and @xmath104 when @xmath103 @xmath105.@xcite    first principle band structure in fig .",
    "1(c ) shows that the fermi level is located just below the dirac - cone - like point of the gapless linear bands , but there is also a wide band crossing the fermi level at @xmath106 point .",
    "most likely the dirac holes and the conventional electrons contribute to the transport simultaneously .",
    "the parabolic curves of @xmath80 plus the opposite signs between @xmath80 and @xmath81(t ) in low field reflect the multiband effect .",
    "hall resistivity @xmath80 can be fitted very well by the two - band hall coefficient eqn.(6 ) , as shown in fig .",
    "7(a ) by two typical curves at 2 k and 20 k. combined it with mr fitting using eqn.(1 ) , we derive some parameters including carrier mobility ( @xmath84 ) and carrier density @xmath107 , as shown in fig",
    "the holes have much higher mobility ( @xmath108 @xmath76/vs ) than the electrons at 2 k , and with increasing temperature , the hole mobility @xmath109 decreases significantly , but the change in the electron mobility @xmath110 is negligible .",
    "the value of mobility at 40 k derived from hall resistivity is consistent with the magnitude from mr fitting .",
    "moreover , the carrier density is positive indicating the hole density is higher than electron density .",
    "electronic transport in the hall channel is determined by the density and mobility of different carriers , according to eqn.(6).@xcite the dirac holes have much higher mobility and dominate the hall resistivity , which make @xmath111 of laagsb@xmath0 positive .",
    "but seebeck coefficient is proportional to the logarithmic derivative of the dos at fermi level and then inversely proportional to the dos at fermi level or carrier density.@xcite especially , for two - dimensional dirac system with linear energy dispersion , @xmath112 could be expected and was indeed observed in graphene.@xcite the electron density is smaller than the hole density according to the two - band analysis of hall resistivity and electron band has smaller dos in laagsb@xmath0 , so @xmath113 is larger than @xmath114 and in zero field seebeck coefficient @xmath81 is negative . with increasing magnetic field",
