    "stellar objects involve in many cases the amplification of magnetic fields by differential rotation . the differential rotation at the bottom of the solar convection zone , for example , acts as a generator for toroidal magnetic fields while the differential rotation is imposed from the convection zone . in principle , there is a large domain of radiative zones in stars in which the amplification by differential rotation is conceivable , where no convective motions disturb the winding - up .",
    "this concerns the whole range of intermediate - mass and massive stars from 1.2  solar masses up to several tens of a solar mass .",
    "all these stars possess large radiative envelopes ( apart from a possible , very thin convective surface layer ) .",
    "we will often speak about a and ap stars in this paper , but the simulations are actually applicable to a wider range of stars possessing non - convective domains , such as solar - like stars with radiative interiors or more massive b stars .    according to stpie ( 2000 ) ,",
    "the pre - main - sequence evolution of stars with masses near two solar masses is accompanied by changes in angular momentum through disk accretion , magnetic star - disk coupling , and magnetized winds .",
    "all these effects likely lead to a differentially rotating interior . when approaching the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) ,",
    "the stars have established their radiative envelopes , and accretion has ceased .",
    "it is then mainly by magnetized winds that the angular velocity is reduced .",
    "this , however , affects only the surface , while it takes extremely long for the small plasma viscosity to reduce also the angular velocity in the interiors .",
    "the coupling of the surface to the interior is strongly enhanced by magnetic fields .",
    "there are a few cases for which an increase of the surface rotation period has actually been observed , such as v901 ori ( mikulaek et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "another source for differential rotation , especially for stars with masses less than @xmath1 , may be the convective phase in the pre - main - sequence evolution . while there is no specific model available for a progenitor of a stars ,",
    "the computations by kker & rdiger ( 2008 ) indicate tendencies of stronger differential rotation for faster rotation , hotter surface temperatures , and especially thinner convective envelopes .",
    "to which extent the differential rotation will be present in the remaining radiative star is debatable , since small magnetic fields in the ( then ) radiative interior are sufficient to prevent differential rotation from spreading below the convection zone ( rdiger & kitchatinov 1997 ; gough & mcintyre 1998 ) .    studying",
    "the interaction between differential rotation and magnetic fields is important for the understanding of the existence of magnetic ap stars , and for the explanation why only a fraction of a stars show the peculiarities .",
    "differential rotation or magnetic fields or combinations of the two may become unstable against small perturbations ( e.g.  watson 1981 ; gilman & fox 1997 ; dikpati et al . 2004 ; braithwaite 2006b ; arlt et al . 2007 ; and many others ) . where mhd is a suitable description of the astrophysical objects , we can group the instabilities into shear - driven , current - driven , and buoyancy - driven instabilities .",
    "current - driven instabilities are particularly interesting for toroidal magnetic fields , since these typically reach the largest strengths if differential rotation is present .",
    "such toroidal fields also come along with currents giving rise to a kink - type instability , whose most easily excited modes are typically modes with low azimuthal wave number ( vandakurov 1972 ; tayler 1973 ; spruit 1999 ) .",
    "we refer to this instability here as tayler instability .",
    "dynamo action arising from the tayler instability was suggested heuristically by spruit ( 2002 ) and later in simulations by braithwaite ( 2006a ) who found sustained , but not constant magnetic field energies in a differentially rotating cylindric domain .",
    "spherical , three - dimensional simulations of the solar radiative interior have been performed by brun & zahn ( 2006 ) where the evolution of a fossil field together with an imposed rotation profile at the top of the domain ( i.e. the bottom of the convection zone ) was investigated .",
    "the initial poloidal magnetic field as well as the later combination of toroidal and poloidal fields showed distinct instability signatures .",
    "the simulations were examined by zahn , brun & mathis ( 2007 ) on possible dynamo action , but none was found . the difference between the two attempts may be the presence of an enforced differential rotation inside the domain of braithwaite s ( 2006a ) simulations , as opposed to the enforcement on the boundary only in the computations by zahn et al .",
    "another non - linear simulation of the tayler instability was performed by gellert , rdiger & elstner ( 2008 ) who also used a cylindrical setup with a differential rotation enforced at the outer radial boundary , but in this case depending on vertical direction @xmath2 only . in terms of a dynamo-@xmath0 they find values of @xmath3 measured against an imposed vertical field . that @xmath4 is 100  per cent of the rms velocity implying that the flow is entirely helical .",
    "however , all magnetic modes decay when the external magnetic field is switched off .",
    "the precise nature of the non - linear evolution of the tayler instability with a possible dynamo effect is thus a very interesting issue on which we follow up here .",
    "the scenario of amplification of magnetic fields by differential rotation , the stability of the resulting configurations , and the possible dynamo effect in case of instability is very general to non - convective zones in a wide range of stars .",
    "section  2 describes how the computations were set up , while section  [ axisymmetric ] shows the results of the axisymmetric , non - linear simulations for the field - amplification .",
    "the analysis in section  [ linear_stability ] deals with the stability of the results in section  [ axisymmetric ] , and section  [ non - linear ] evolves the full three - dimensional and non - linear problem .",
    "dynamo coefficients are derived in section  [ dynamo ] .",
    "with respect to the instability , we will focus on the pre - main - sequence evolution of ap stars here , whereas the possible dynamo action is not believed to be an important ap star phenomenon , but is of general interest for dynamo theory .",
    "the computational domain is a spherical shell with the radius @xmath5 running from an inner radius @xmath6 to an outer radius @xmath7 which is normalized to one by the stellar radius @xmath8 in the following .",
    "the colatitude @xmath9 always covers the range from  0 to @xmath10 ; the azimuthal coordinate @xmath11 runs from  0 to @xmath12 in the non - axisymmetric simulations .",
    "the inner radius was set to @xmath13 in all the computations of this study .",
    "the investigation involves three steps : step  i one is an axisymmetric simulation with an initial differential rotation @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the axis distance , and an initial poloidal magnetic field @xmath16 .",
    "step  ii is a stability analysis where a number of snapshots of the simulation of the first step is used as background states for a linear analysis of the stability of the system against non - axisymmetric perturbations .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the stability of perturbations with azimuthal wave - numbers of @xmath17 .",
    "step  iii consists of fully non - linear , three - dimensional computations of the evolution . in these simulations ,",
    "the non - axisymmetric perturbation is either present from the beginning , or is imposed at a later step as an external ` kick ' to the system .",
    "we can thus compare the evolutions of states which are either tayler - stable or tayler - unstable according to step  ii .",
    "the non - linear evolutions also allow to assess the possibility of driving a dynamo with the instability .",
    "dynamo effect will be visible only in terms of non - vanishing dynamo - coefficients of a mean - field description , but not in growing and sustained magnetic fields , because our system lacks a source of energy .",
    "the computations employ the spherical mhd code by hollerbach ( 2000 ) which integrates the momentum , induction , and temperature equations in the boussinesq approximation .",
    "we are not using temperature fluctuations in this study ; the normalized , incompressible mhd equations are thus @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the velocity and magnetic fields and @xmath21 is the pressure . additionally , the relations @xmath22 and @xmath23 hold . the magnetic permeability and the density",
    "are set to unity in this system of units .",
    "since all quantities are normalized with the magnetic diffusivity @xmath24 , the magnetic prandtl number @xmath25 appears in the momentum equation , where @xmath26 is the kinematic viscosity .",
    "velocities are normalized by @xmath27 , times by @xmath28 .    for steps",
    "i and iii , the differential rotation and the poloidal magnetic field are initial conditions .",
    "they evolve freely without any further imposed properties .",
    "the profile of the initial angular velocity follows @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the non - dimensional angular velocity on the axis and @xmath31 is a parameter controlling the steepness of the rotation profile . with our normalization ,",
    "the initial magnetic reynolds number is actually @xmath32 , since @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the angular velocity of the star in physical units .",
    "the magnetic reynolds number was @xmath35 in all computations except one ; the magnetic prandtl number was always @xmath36 .",
    "the pre - main - sequence evolution of the rotation period of intermediate - mass stars contains most likely both a spin - up ( contraction and accretion ) phase and a spin - down phase with magnetized winds ( stpie 2000 ) .",
    "we are concerned with the evolution near the end of the pre - main - sequence phase and the early main - sequence life when most of the star is already radiative ( convectively stable ) .",
    "the probable angular - momentum change is a spin - down then , acting on the surface of the star , and this is the reason why we assumed an angular velocity _ decreasing _ with axis distance .",
    "the initial profile uses @xmath37 , but @xmath31 will later be used to measure the actual steepness of the rotation curve in the simulation .",
    "the specific angular momentum @xmath38 is increasing with axis distance everywhere in the computational domain .",
    "the system is thus not prone to the hydrodynamic rayleigh instability which we do not want to investigate here .",
    "the hydrodynamic stability has been tested numerically with non - axisymmetric perturbations which were symmetric and anti - symmetric with respect to the equator .",
    "all situations delivered a decay of the perturbations .",
    "magnetic fields are measured in terms of lundquist numbers , which is the same as the non - dimensional alfvn velocity in our system of units , @xmath39 the magnetic diffusivity @xmath24 in time - dependent simulations typically represents a value between the microscopic diffusivity of the plasma and the turbulent diffusivity resulting from , e.g. , averaged convective motions . of the quantities entering ( [ bconvert ] ) , @xmath24 is the one which is known least .",
    "it is therefore best to eliminate @xmath24 by @xmath40 and thus retrieve the physical magnetic fields by comparing its alfvn speed with the rotational velocity , @xmath41 considering a @xmath42 star with a radius of @xmath43 , a rotation period of 10  days ( @xmath44 ) and a density of 0.015  g/@xmath45 at @xmath46 , a magnetic field of @xmath47 converts to 1660  g in physical units with the magnetic reynolds number of 20000 used in most of our simulations .    the boundary conditions for all runs presented here",
    "employ stress - free conditions for the flow and vacuum conditions for the magnetic field at both the inner and outer radii , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "although the inner sphere is supposed to be highly conducting , a vacuum condition helps in obtaining smoother solutions compared to a superconducting condition .",
    "the latter prohibits a penetration of the magnetic field through the inner boundary .",
    "this typically leads to strong currents near the inner boundary which are not there if the conductivity would change continuously into the inner sphere . if , for efficiency reasons , the whole star can not be computed , the vacuum condition is a suitable choice despite the non - vanishing conductivity .",
    "we will come back to a test run with a perfect - conductor boundary at @xmath6 in section  [ non - linear ] .",
    "note that the assumption of an initially independent angular velocity of the vertical axis @xmath48 ( tayler - proudman state ) is not compatible with a stress - free condition on a spherical surface .",
    "this causes small meridional flows and results in a small deviation from the tayler - proudman state .",
    "however , this is a much better choice than an initial rotation profile depending on @xmath5 which causes a severe redistribution of angular momentum towards a configuration which is very near a tayler - proudman state during the first rotations of the system . as we did not want to obtain a mixed evolution of this hydrodynamic phenomenon with the magnetic phenomena , we chose @xmath14 instead of more complicated profiles @xmath49 .",
    "the spin - down by winds during the late pre - main - sequence phase of intermediate - mass stars is probably not causing a precise @xmath14 profile , but for the sake of physical clarity , we choose a tayler - proudman state as an initial condition for the runs .",

    "first we study the amplification of magnetic fields by shear as well as the back - reaction of the fields on the differential rotation .",
    "the two - dimensional , non - linear simulations thus start with an initial differential rotation and a purely poloidal magnetic field in a radiative stellar zone .",
    "these initial conditions evolve freely without any imposed flows or fields , neither in the bulk of the computational domain nor at the boundaries .",
    "the early phase of the simulation shows a generation and steep amplification of toroidal magnetic field through differential rotation .",
    "the generated @xmath50 and , to a smaller extent , also the @xmath51 impose a lorentz force to the rotational velocity and redistributes angular momentum . this is why at the same time of field amplification , the differential rotation starts to decrease , and the toroidal - field growth is thus limited .",

    "interestingly , the run with a stronger initial poloidal magnetic field shows a reversal of the differential rotation profile after 0.006 diffusion times . only after a very long period ,",
    "not plotted here , the shear converges to zero in the entire computational domain .",
    "maximum internal field strengths are about 24  kg in the run with @xmath58 and about 16  kg in the run with @xmath59 , using the conversion ( [ bphys ] ) .",
    "much higher magnetic reynolds numbers encountered in real stars lead to stronger toroidal fields .",
    "a run with @xmath60 later described in section  [ non - linear ] reached about 46 kg .",
    "the amplification time results from the comparison of the lorentz force acting on the differential rotation with the generation of toroidal magnetic field by the shear . the linearized action of the lorentz force may be approximated by @xmath61 and the linear winding up of toroidal field in the induction equation can be estimated by @xmath62 . plugging the @xmath63 into the first relation , delivers @xmath64 .",
    "the amplification time is independent of the rotation rate , the amplitude of the differential rotation , and the diffusivity . in our dimensionless system ,",

    "[ amplification ] . the dashed curve from half the initial field strength peaks at roughly twice that period  a bit earlier since diffusion and hydrodynamic redistribution of angular momentum",
    "are also at play in this numerical setup .",
    "there is a slight tendency of smaller magnetic reynolds numbers producing shorter times to reach the peak magnetic field .",
    "this is solely due to the non - vanishing viscosity , being present in our system of finite @xmath40 , which adds to the reduction of the differential rotation and limits the growth eventually .",
    "a real system with stellar microscopic diffusivities of say @xmath66  @xmath67/s will show a nearly stationary phase after the amplification , since the ohmic decay times are of order gigayears .",
    "a time - dependent numerical simulation can not model the very low diffusivity at the true rotation rate , and the solution is subject to a much larger ohmic dissipation after the maximum toroidal field is reached .",
    "the following process is thus characterized by a decay of both magnetic fields and differential rotation .",

    "rapid rotation will suppress the tayler instability in general .",
    "once the accretion ceases and the disk turns into a more passive environment of the star , the stellar wind leads to a spin - down of the star .",
    "the increase of the rotation period can be quite steep , but only if strong magnetic fields are present ( stpie & landstreet 2002 ) .",
    "we are left with a contradiction here , since the spin - down requires poloidal fields , but the tayler - instability providing these poloidal fields will set in only if the rotation period has already increased .",
    "another question concerns the time it takes for the unstable magnetic field to become visible on the surface . in the 3d simulation",
    ", we find a maximum of @xmath177 at the surface , about 18  rotation periods after the onset of the instability .",

    "[ spuxb_nonlin16a ] demonstrates that the motions arising from the instability are mostly horizontal .",

    "stable _ toroidal flux tube was studied by mestel & moss ( 2010 ) .",
    "a tentative conversion of their time - scales into stellar values leads to 150  myr and more which is more than an order of magnitude longer than in the unstable case ( smaller structures ) .",
    "the maximum poloidal field at the surface converts to about 2.7  kg using ( [ bphys ] ) .",
    "the time - scale of 9  myr is actually very interesting for ap stars , it may take some time on the main sequence before the ap phenomenon is observable ( hubrig , north & mathys 2000 ) .",
    "other observations favour a persistence of magnetic fields from early herbig ae / be stars to main - sequence ap stars ( wade et al .",
    "by contrast , hubrig et al . ( 2009 ) find decreasing magnetic fields in herbig ae / be stars with age . while the observational picture will be gradually completing , simulations for a whole sequence of magnetic reynolds numbers will be need to tell whether the emergence time - scale is indeed a fraction of the diffusion time .",
    "note that the above mentioned 2.7  kg are small compared to the internally possible toroidal fields of @xmath181@xmath182  g. what appears to be a strong field in observations , can yet be a remnant of something much larger .",
    "also the amount of complexity of the surface magnetic fields is compatible with surface fields from zeeman doppler imaging ( e.g. kochukhov et al .",
    "note that differences in initial conditions may cause a variety of final surface field strengths as well as a variety of emergence times , very similar to the complex observational picture that has been compiled up to now .",
    "we are left with two possible ways to magnetic ap stars : the existence of fossil field configurations that are stable for very long times on the one hand , and the emergence of magnetic fields by an instability on the other hand , where the ` disrupted ' configuration is the observed and long - term stable one .",
    "our paper studies the latter option .",
    "since the differential rotation vanishes due to the presence of the fields , there is no further build - up of toroidal fields and the ` disrupted ' fields will be fairly stationary over evolutionary time - scales .",
    "a comparison of the topology at very late stages with the ones obtained in compressible , but non - rotating simulations by braithwaite & nordlund ( 2006 ) will be interesting , once long enough simulations are available .",
    "it is probable that the pre - main - sequence evolution of a stars is a mixture of various phenomena : the presence or absence of a substantial magnetic field in the collapsing cloud core , a possible short - lived dynamo during the convective phase ( arlt 2009 ) , the angular - momentum evolution controlled by various torques , and the onset of the tayler instability .",
    "it is still a challenge to explain why roughly 10  per cent of the possible scenarios lead to the ap star phenomena , while the remaining fraction does not lead to strong fields at the stellar surfaces ( fields may still be hidden in the star ) .",
    "however , the study of differences in the rotational evolution including differences in the amplitude of the differential rotation ( delivering both a wide range of toroidal fields and large difference in stability limits ) are a promising field to find discriminating situations between normal a stars and ap stars .",
    "_ dynamo action _  apart from looking at the the evolution of magnetic fields in the pre - main - sequence phase of ap stars , we also studied the possibility of driving a dynamo from the instability in terms of representing it as a mean - field dynamo .",
    "we find enhanced values for the dynamo-@xmath0 and related effects describing the field generation in a mean - field context .",
    "an axisymmetric dynamo driven by the tayler instability can not be excluded , although a proper energy source is missing in our setup .",
    "the prerequisite for the existence of an @xmath0-effect appears to be the presence of an inner boundary at which most of the @xmath0 is concentrated , as is the kinetic helicity .",
    "the situation is thus interesting for earth - like planetary interiors which have a solid inner core acting as an inner wall . to be interesting for a radiative zone",
    ", an inner boundary will be required such as a convective core , whose turbulent viscosity has a similar effect like a wall .",
    "this core should not be too far away from the tayler - unstable zone , so a possible dynamo could be relevant for early b stars at best .",
    "the results do not support a dynamo from the tayler instability in the solar tachocline though .",
    "an interesting domain is the earth s dynamo though , since the outer , fluid spherical shell of the core is very similar to what was studied here .",
    "because of the rather small differential rotation of the core , the onset of current - driven instabilities as well as helicity distributions as shown in this paper are possibly emerging in geodynamo simulations .",

    "<S> this study is concerned with the early evolution of magnetic fields and differential rotation of intermediate - mass stars which may evolve into ap stars . </S>",
    "<S> we report on simulations of the interplay of differential rotation and magnetic fields , the stability limits and non - linear evolution of such configurations , and the prospects of dynamo action from the unstable cases . </S>",
    "<S> the axisymmetric problem delivers a balance between field amplification and back - reaction of the magnetic field on the differential rotation . </S>",
    "<S> the non - axisymmetric case involves also the tayler instability of the amplified toroidal fields . </S>",
    "<S> we consider limits for field amplification and apply these to young a stars .    </S>",
    "<S> apart from its application to ap stars , the instability is scrutinized for the fundamental possibility of a dynamo . </S>",
    "<S> we are not looking for a dynamo as an explanation for the ap star phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic helicity is concentrated near the tangent cylinder of the inner sphere of the computational domain and is negative in the northern hemisphere . </S>",
    "<S> this appears to be a ubiquitous effect not special to the tayler instability . </S>",
    "<S> the latter is actually connected with a positive current helicity in the bulk of the spherical shell giving rise to a small , but non - vanishing @xmath0-effect in non - linear evolution of the instability .    </S>",
