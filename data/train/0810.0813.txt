    "the nature of dark energy remains one of the most fundamental questions in physics and cosmology .",
    "it is accessible only through astronomical observations , and a number of large galaxy redshift surveys and weak - lensing observations are expected to yield tight constraints on the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath11 .",
    "the use of baryon acoustic oscillations ( hereafter baos ) is a promising tool to determine @xmath12 .",
    "the characteristic scale of baos can be used as a robust standard ruler , which helps us to reconstruct the expansion history of the universe .",
    "substantial improvements in theories as well as observations are required to constrain @xmath13 within an accuracy of a few percent , which is the goal of next generation bao surveys .",
    "@xcite showed that the measurements of the angular diameter distance and of the hubble parameter must be very accurate , with errors less than @xmath6 , in order to constrain @xmath12 at a @xmath14 level at @xmath9 in the special case that the other cosmological parameters are fixed .",
    "clearly , theoretical models are required to predict the matter power spectrum with even better accuracy .",
    "recently , significant progress has been made in developing analytic models of the matter power spectrum by extending conventional perturbation theory ( e.g. , crocce & scoccimarro 2006a , b , 2008 ; matarresse & pietroni 2007 , 2008 ; @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological @xmath0-body simulations are often used as a reference to calibrate these models .",
    "it is not clear , however , whether or not @xmath0-body simulations provide sufficiently accurate results at the required percent level even at weakly nonlinear scales where perturbation theory is generally supposed to be reasonably accurate .",
    "indeed a variety of systematic effects needs to be considered in interpreting the results of @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "it is well known that discreteness of a density field in @xmath0-body simulations causes spurious behaviour of the power spectrum at length scales comparable to or smaller than the mean inter - particle separation ( @xcite ; joyce & marcos 2007a , b ; @xcite ) .",
    "adopting a finite - size simulation box and imposing a periodic boundary condition also systematically biases the growth of density fluctuations at almost all the length scales @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite examined the effect of the finite number of fourier modes in a _ single",
    "_ @xmath0-body realization due to a finite box size .",
    "they found that the evolution of the power spectrum measured from each realization deviates from the prediction of perturbation theory by more than a few percent even at very large scales ( e.g. @xmath15mpc@xmath16 ) and that this deviation results from having only a finite number of modes , which can be explained by including second - order perturbation contributions .",
    "this implies that a sub - percent level accuracy both in theories and in simulations is very demanding and we need to explore this in detail .    in the present paper ,",
    "we consider a specialized case of the matter power spectrum in real space .",
    "we critically compare the evolution of the matter density fluctuations in the weakly nonlinear regime in cosmological simulations to that of theoretical predictions .",
    "we measure the matter power spectra using the simulation outputs and compare them with analytic models . in doing",
    "so we correct for the finite - mode effect pointed out by @xcite . unlike the conventional approach",
    ", we do not regard the results of @xmath0-body simulations as perfect calibrators of analytical models .",
    "we determine ranges of wavenumbers where both theories and @xmath0-body simulations agree within a given accuracy .",
    "the rest of the present paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : nonlinear ] briefly outlines the analytic models that we examine for the nonlinear matter power spectrum .",
    "section [ sec : simulations ] describes our simulation details .",
    "our methods to measure the matter power spectrum and to correct for the finite volume effect are shown in section [ sec : power ] .",
    "we show our results of @xmath0-body simulations and determine the convergence regime in wavenumber in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "we also discuss the phase information of baos and predict the parameter forecast from the modes in this convergence regime alone in section [ sec : implication ] .",
    "finally section [ sec : summary ] summarizes the present paper .",
    "the convergence tests of our @xmath0-body simulations are discussed in the appendix .",
    "various analytic models have been proposed to account for nonlinear evolution of the matter power spectra in real space . in this paper , we will compare @xmath0-body simulations with three different analytic models , specifically focusing on the leading - order contributions .",
    "the models include standard perturbation theory ( spt ; e.g. , @xcite ) , renormalized perturbation theory ( rpt ; @xcitea , b , 2008 ) , and the closure approximation ( cla ; @xcite ) .",
    "spt is a straightforward expansion of the fluid equations around their linear solution , assuming that fluctuation amplitudes are small .",
    "schematically , the expansion is written @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the linear power spectrum , which grows as @xmath19 with linear growth rate , @xmath20 .",
    "the second term , @xmath21 , is the one - loop correction to the power spectrum , which represents the contributions coming from the second - order and third - order solutions .",
    "the one - loop correction is roughly proportional to @xmath22 with @xmath23 , and this term subsequently exceeds the linear term at lower redshift and smaller scales .",
    "the explicit expressions for the one - loop correction @xmath21 may be found in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "both rpt and cla are constructed from the renormalized expression of a perturbation series obtained from spt , by introducing non - perturbative statistical quantities such as the propagator and the vertex function .",
    "the resultant _ renormalized _ expressions for the power spectrum are given as an infinite series of irreducible diagrams composed of the propagator , the vertex function , and the power spectra themselves in a fully non - perturbative way .",
    "then , employing the born approximation , rpt of @xcite perturbatively evaluates the renormalized diagrams under the tree - level approximation of vertex functions .",
    "in contrast , cla proposed by @xcite first truncates the renormalized expansion at the one - loop order under the tree - level approximation of vertex functions , and obtains a closed set of equations for the power spectrum and the propagator . in practice , they further apply the born approximation to the truncated diagram . as a result",
    ", the leading - order calculations of the power spectra in cla reduce to the same analytic expression as in the case of rpt , leading to @xmath24 here , the function @xmath25 is the propagator , and the term @xmath26 represents the corrections generated by mode - mode coupling at smaller scales , constructed from the one - loop diagram . in the above expression ,",
    "the only difference between cla and rpt is the asymptotic behavior of the propagator .",
    "the explicit expressions for the propagator together with the mode - coupling term are summarized in ( 2006b , 2008 ) and @xcite .",
    "we note here that the most important difference between spt and rpt / cla is the convergence properties dictated by the propagator .",
    "similar to @xmath21 of spt , the term @xmath26 is roughly proportional to @xmath27 , but it additionally contains propagators , leading to a large suppression at high @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , to the one - loop level , rpt and cla are expected to be most accurate at low @xmath28 ( below the propagator damping scale ) , but the predictions at low @xmath28 are expected to be much accurate for rpt / cla compared to spt .",
    "in this section we describe our fiducial simulations .",
    "we also run some simulations with different settings ( initial conditions , integrators and box sizes ) , which are discussed in the appendix .",
    "we begin with an explanation of our initial conditions for the @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we compute the linear power spectrum at an initial redshift @xmath29 using camb @xcite .",
    "for all the simulations in the present paper , we adopt the standard @xmath1cdm model with the cosmological parameters from the wmap3 results @xcite , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 , which are the current matter , cosmological constant , baryon densities in units of the critical density , the hubble constant in units of @xmath36km@xmath37s@xmath16mpc@xmath16 , density fluctuation amplitude smoothed with a top - hat filter of radius @xmath38mpc , and the scalar spectral index , respectively ( see table [ tab : parameter ] ) .",
    "we then generate a linear overdensity field in fourier space assuming gaussianity ; the amplitude follows the rayleigh distribution , and the phase is uniformly distributed .",
    "we employ @xmath39 dark matter particles within a cube of @xmath40mpc in each side .",
    "we displace these particles from regular grid pre - initial positions using the second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we next describe the time integration scheme .",
    "we adopt a publicly available parallel cosmological @xmath0-body solver gadget2 @xcite .",
    "the number of meshes used in the particle - mesh computation is @xmath41 .",
    "we adopt a softening length of @xmath42mpc for the tree forces .",
    "we select three output redshifts ; @xmath43 , @xmath4 and @xmath44 , where we measure the power spectrum ( see section [ sec : power ] for more details ) .    in the appendix",
    ", we discuss the convergence of our simulations against different initial conditions , box sizes , and codes .",
    "we found that the current setup provides a convergent result within @xmath6 of the amplitude of the power spectrum at our scales of interest ( @xmath45mpc@xmath16 ) .",
    "we use this setup as our fiducial model , and run @xmath46 different realizations for this model .    .",

    "the three solid lines plot equation ( [ eq : validk ] ) : @xmath49 for linear theory ( @xmath50 ) , spt ( @xmath51 ) and rpt / cla ( @xmath52 ) from left to right , and the dashed lines are corresponding @xmath47 ( @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively ) .",
    "we also show the nonlinear wavenumbers proposed by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite as dotted lines with jk06 , sk07 and m08 .",
    "the two shaded regions show the redshift range planed by wfmos survey ( with minimum wavenumbers , @xmath56 . here",
    "@xmath57 is the survey volume.).,width=396 ]",
    "so far we have focused on the amplitudes of the matter power spectra , but the phase information of baos is also important .",
    "this is imprinted mainly in the leading term which is the product of the linear power spectrum and the propagator in rpt and cla [ see equation ( [ eq : pk_rpt_cla ] ) ] . since the other contributions , the mode - coupling terms , are fairly smooth functions of wavenumber , the phase information of baos is almost erased by the convolution of the smoothed kernel and the propagator .",
    "therefore almost all of the bao information comes from the zeroth - order term in rpt / cla .",
    "we thus expect that the phase of baos predicted by @xmath0-body simulations and theories agree with each other for a wider range of wavenumbers compared to the amplitudes since the amplitudes are sensitive to higher - order corrections .",
    "we test the convergence of the predicted phases of baos as follows .",
    "we first construct a smooth reference power spectrum using the spline technique developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we adopt a basis spline ( b - spline ) fitting function as the reference spectrum , @xmath58 , with the break points at @xmath59mpc@xmath16 and @xmath60mpc@xmath16 where @xmath61 is a positive integer .",
    "the data points to be fitted are set at @xmath62 of equation ( [ eq : ki ] ) with a bin width of @xmath63mpc@xmath16 for both the @xmath0-body simulations results and the theoretical predictions .",
    "we use the @xmath0-body power spectrum , @xmath64 , in which the effect of finite volume is corrected using perturbation theory .",
    "we assign equal weights to all data points .",
    "a smooth reference spectrum is computed for the average of the simulations and the theoretical models .",
    "we then divide the model and @xmath0-body power spectra by their respective smooth reference power spectra , @xmath58 , described above , which are shown in figure [ fig : wiggle ] .",
    "the symbols and lines have the same meanings as in figure [ fig : icv+fmc ] . among the three nonlinear models ,",
    "rpt and cla lie almost on top of each other , and they are indistinguishable .",
    "these two models show better agreement with @xmath0-body simulations than spt , whose predicted strong damping of oscillations incorrectly leads to a phase reversal ( @xmath65mpc@xmath66 at @xmath67 , @xmath68mpc@xmath16 at @xmath69 ) . compared with the vertical arrows which represent the values of @xmath2 determined by the amplitudes of the power spectra , the convergence regimes of bao phases predicted by analytic models and @xmath0-body simulations are quite a bit wider .",
    "we thus conclude that the phases of baos are potentially more robust and more useful in the actual analysis of bao surveys .",
    ".,width=396 ]      with our criteria for trustable ranges of simulations and analytic models , we are able to discuss future cosmological constraints using baos . a number of simulation papers attempted to present parameter forecasting of the dark energy equation of state parameter , @xmath11 , using baos as a standard ruler ( i.e. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2008 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2005 ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2008 ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , 2008 ) .",

    "the solid lines show the results when we use rpt as the template spectrum , while the dashed ones correspond to an ideal case of no shot noise and no nonlinear degradation of baos ( using the linear theory template ) .",
    "we fix the minimum wavenumber to be used in the fitting , @xmath105mpc@xmath16 , and the results are plotted as a function of the maximum wavenumber .",
    "the assumed survey parameters are written in the figure.,width=396 ]",
    "we have carried out a systematic comparison of power spectra calculated from @xmath0-body simulations and various theoretical models .",
    "we correct for the effect of finite volume of @xmath0-body simulations using the perturbation - theory - based methodology developed in @xcite .",
    "we find that our simulations agree with all the theoretical models used in the present paper at large length scales ( @xmath15mpc@xmath16 ) . at smaller length scales where nonlinearity is mild , our simulations , rpt ( crocce & scoccimarro 2006a , b , 2008 ) and cla @xcite agree with @xmath6 and @xmath106 accuracies up to @xmath2 and @xmath107 as presented in figure [ fig : limit ] .",
    "these convergence regimes depend on the redshift and can be explained by a simple empirical formula of equation ( [ eq : validk ] ) .",
    "we also showed that the phase information of baos extracted from power spectra using b - spline fitting is more robust than the amplitudes : predicted phases of nonlinear theories and @xmath0-body simulations agree well in a wider range of wavenumbers than the amplitudes of the power spectrum .",
    "the currently achieved accuracies of both theoretical predictions and simulations are sufficient to interpret the data from future surveys like wfmos : one can put a tight constraint on the bao scale ( @xmath108 ) using modes within our convergence regimes .",
    "there is the potential to extract more than simply the bao scale from the power spectrum , such as the sum of the neutrino masses , if one is able to exploit smaller scale information ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to this end , it is important to consider higher - order corrections ( i.e. , 2-loop terms ) on the theory end and higher resolution simulations .",
    "it is also important to investigate the accuracy of the velocity field in @xmath0-body simulations to model accurately in redshift space .",
    "these are future investigations and a study in redshift space is now in progress .",
    "we also checked the convergence of the matter power spectrum in @xmath0-body simulations changing the initial conditions , @xmath0-body solvers , and box sizes . among these we showed that @xmath0-body simulations with small box sizes ( @xmath109mpc ) suffer from systematic enhancements of the matter power spectra at bao scales ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "we test two methods for generating cosmological initial conditions .",
    "one is the zeldovich approximation ( @xcite ; hereafter za ) commonly used for cosmological simulations , and the other is second - order lagrangian perturbation theory ( 2lpt ; e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "starting from the same linear density field , @xmath110 , we generate two initial conditions at @xmath29 from @xmath0-body runs using za and 2lpt .",
    "then we compare the power spectra evolved with gadget2 .",
    "figure [ fig : za2lpt ] shows the ratio of the two matter power spectra from simulations at various output redshifts .",
    "the overall trend that @xmath111 has smaller amplitudes at all scales than @xmath112 is consistent with the result of @xcite .",
    "this is because the higher - order terms in za do not necessarily correspond to the growing solutions .",
    "the plot indicates that differences in the initial conditions affect the power spectrum at the few percent level .",
    "we confirmed that this difference between 2lpt and za reduces to subpercent when we increase the starting redshift to @xmath113 .",
    "however , we need a very large number of mesh points in the calculation of the pm force to avoid large errors introduced by the tree force that arise when the density field is nearly uniform .",
    "this is very time consuming .",
    "thus we need 2lpt initial condition for the purpose of present analysis if we start the simulations at @xmath29 .",
    "we also confirm that our 2lpt result is not affected when we change the starting redshift to @xmath114 or @xmath113 .",
    "next we compare three different n - body solvers ; a tree - particle - mesh ( tree - pm ) solver gadget2 @xcite , another tree - pm code tpm of @xcite , and a particle - particle - particle - mesh ( p@xmath8 m ) code developed in jing & suto ( 1998 , 2002 ; hereafter js02 ) .",
    "we use identical initial conditions as that of one of our fiducial runs , @xmath39 particles in a box of @xmath40mpc .",
    "we stop the simulations at @xmath43 .",
    "in addition to the tree - pm and p@xmath8 m calculations , we also run simulations using only the pm part of the three codes .",
    "we measure the power spectra for the simulation output at @xmath43 and correct for the effect of finite volume ( see section [ sec : power ] above ) so that the comparison is clearer .    figure [ fig : comp ] shows the relative difference from the rpt prediction , @xmath115/p^{\\rm nw}(k)$ ] .",
    "the upper panel shows the results when we include the short - range forces ( i.e. , tree or particle - particle force ) .",
    "the result of tpm , js02 and gadget2 are shown by dotted , dashed and solid lines with errorbars , respectively .",
    "we omit the errorbars for tpm and js02 as these are almost the same as for gadget2 , which is given by equation ( [ eq : error3 ] ) .",
    "the overall behaviours for the three codes are very consistent , and the difference is important ( @xmath116 ) only at smaller scale than @xmath2 of rpt / cla shown by the vertical arrow . in the bottom panel",
    "we plot the results of the three codes when we use only pm forces .",
    "the degree of dispersion among the three is larger than that in the upper panel , and is @xmath117 at @xmath2 of rpt / cla .",
    "the short - range force is helpful to increase the accuracy at this level at this scale .",
    "we conclude that our main result is not affected so much by the choice of particular @xmath0-body solver when we turn on the short - range force .    -body simulation codes .",
    "we plot @xmath118/p^{\\rm      nw}(k)$ ] at @xmath43 .",

    "width=396 ]      the finite box size introduces an additional variance in the power spectrum as shown in @xcite and this work .",
    "it is possible that this finiteness affects not only the variance but also the mean value .",
    "the resolution of simulations may also affect the results .",
    "we thus investigate the box size / resolution dependence of the power spectra from @xmath0-body simulations .    in order to increase the spatial resolution ,",
    "we run simulations varying the box size [ @xmath120 ( @xmath46 realizations ; fiducial ) , @xmath121 ( @xmath122 realizations ) and @xmath123mpc ( @xmath124 realizations ) ] but keeping the number of particles to be the same as our fiducial runs ( @xmath39 ) to check the convergence . for this test",
    ", we use outputs at @xmath43 .",
    "the results are shown in figure [ fig : boxsize ] .",
    "symbols correspond to @xmath125mpc ( circle ) , @xmath126mpc ( triangle ) and @xmath123mpc ( square ) .",
    "we adopt the bin width @xmath127mpc@xmath16 in this section for clarity .",
    "we also calculate the rpt predictions with the effect of finite box size by introducing a cut - off scale ( @xmath128 ) in the integration , which are shown in the left panel .",
    "the solid line is the normal rpt result ( without cut - off ) , and the other lines take account of the effect of finite box size ( short - dashed : @xmath40mpc , long - dashed : @xmath126mpc and dot - dashed : @xmath123mpc ) .",
    "note that we show only the results without cutoff in the text .",
    "in the right panel , we plot a comparison with the spt prediction ( no cut - off ) to show the dependence on the box size of the valid ranges of spt .    in the left panel ,",
    "one may notice the difference of theoretical lines at large wavenumbers .",
    "this reflects the finiteness of the box : short - dashed line ( @xmath129 mpc case ) deviates from solid line ( infinite volume case ) only at @xmath130 mpc @xmath16 and is very small ( @xmath131 at @xmath132 mpc @xmath16 ) , whereas long - dashed and dash - dotted ones ( @xmath133 and @xmath123 mpc cases ) diverge at smaller wavenumbers and to a greater degree ( @xmath134 and @xmath117 at @xmath132 mpc @xmath16 , respectively ) .",
    "although the results of @xmath0-body simulations with smaller box sizes have larger variances due to smaller total volumes than the fiducial runs , box size dependence appears at small scales .",
    "the runs with smaller box size tend to have larger amplitudes , which is consistent with rpt predictions with cutoff scales .",
    "we thus conclude that the results of simulations also suffer from a systematic effect due to finite box size , and adopt @xmath135mpc for our fiducial model , where the effect is @xmath136 .",
    "next , the convergence regime of spt seems wider if one believes the results of the smaller box size runs in the right panel .",
    "we consider these wider valid ranges are just coincidences due to the systematic effects in the simulations with smaller box sizes and should not be trusted .",
    "one should keep this in mind when one uses the results of simulations with small box size .",
    "even the millennium simulation @xcite has only @xmath126mpc on each side , although it has many more particles ( @xmath137 ) than ours and thus the spacial resolution is better .",
    "this box size introduces @xmath116 systematics at @xmath138mpc@xmath16 according to our figure [ fig : boxsize ] .",
    "part of the disagreement in the valid range of spt between our results and that of @xcite may be due to this effect , as they use @xmath139 , @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142mpc .",
