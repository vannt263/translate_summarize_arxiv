    "the classical and pioneering works in the field of stellar physics include dynamics of supernova explosion by baade @xmath5 zwicky @xcite , energy production in stars and stellar evolution by bethe @xcite , and , synthesis of elements in stars by burbidge et al .",
    "since then the microphysics of supernova explosion has come a long way . whereas the strong interactions ( fusion reactions ) are responsible for providing the fuel to the stars empowering them throughout their life cycles , it is precisely the weak interactions that play a decisive role in determining both the presupernova stellar structure and the nucleosynthesis .",
    "the weak interaction reactions lead to the initiation of the gravitational collapse of the core of a massive star triggering a supernova explosion , control the lepton - to - baryon fraction of the core throughout the course of stellar evolution , play a key role in neutronisation of the core material , and , affect the formation of heavy elements above iron via the r - process at the final stage of the supernova explosion .",
    "much to the advantage of the astrophysicists , the temperature during the late phases of stellar evolution is high enough for the matter composition to be given by nuclear statistical equilibrium .",
    "this means that one can get away with the need of reaction networks for the strong and electromagnetic interactions and the composition of the matter is given by the saha equation .",
    "weak interactions in presupernova stars are known to be dominated by allowed fermi ( vector - type ) and gamow - teller ( axial - vector type ) transitions .",
    "the calculation of weak - interaction rates is very sensitive to the distribution of the gt@xmath6 strength function . in the gt@xmath7 strength a proton",
    "is changed into a neutron whereas the gt@xmath8 strength is responsible for transforming a neutron into a proton .",
    "it was fuller , fowler , and newman ( ffn ) @xcite who first performed an extensive calculation of stellar weak rates including the capture rates , decay rates , neutrino energy loss rates and gamma heating rates for a wide density and temperature domain .",
    "they performed their detailed calculation for 226 nuclei in the mass range @xmath9 .",
    "the authors recognized the key role played by the gt giant resonance and noted that measured decay rates exploited only a small fraction of the total available strength .",
    "the centroids of the gt@xmath6 distribution functions determine the effective energy of the capture and decay reactions .",
    "ffn estimated the gt contributions to the rates by a parametrization based on the independent particle model .",
    "aufderheide et al .",
    "@xcite later extended the ffn work for heavier nuclei with a @xmath10 60 and took into consideration the quenching of the gt strength neglected by ffn .",
    "authors in ref .",
    "@xcite also stressed on the importance of @xmath0-decay rates in the iron core prior to the collapse .",
    "they tabulated the 71 top @xmath0-decay nuclei averaged throughout the stellar trajectory for @xmath11 ( see table 26 of ref .",
    "the measured data from various @xmath12 and @xmath13 experiments later revealed the misplacement of the gt centroids adopted in the parameterizations of ffn and subsequently used in the calculation of weak rates by ref .",
    "since then theoretical efforts were concentrated on the microscopic calculations of weak - interaction mediated rates of iron - regime nuclide .",
    "two such widely used models are the large - scale shell model ( lssm)(e.g .",
    "@xcite ) and the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) theory ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the pn - qrpa theory is an efficient way to generate gt strength distributions which constitute a primary and nontrivial contribution to the weak - interaction mediated rates among iron - regime nuclide .",
    "the shell model calculations perform a detailed study of the nuclear spectroscopy , however , the pn - qrpa model has two important advantages .",
    "it can handle any arbitrarily heavy system of nucleons since the calculation is performed in a luxurious model space of up to 7 major oscillator shells .",
    "the second advantage is even more important for the calculation of weak - interaction rates in stellar matter . because of the high temperatures prevailing during the presupernova and supernova phases of a massive star",
    ", there is a reasonable probability of occupation of parent excited states and the total weak interaction rates have a finite contribution form these excited states .",
    "thus , in calculating a stellar rate , one must know the gt strength distributions of the excited states of the parent nucleus .",
    "as experimental information about excited state strength functions seems inaccessible , aufderheide @xcite stressed much earlier the need to probe these strength functions theoretically .",
    "the pn - qrpa model calculates the gt strength distribution strengths of _ all _ excited states of parent nucleus in a microscopic fashion and this feature of the pn - qrpa model greatly enhances the reliability of the calculated rates in stellar matter .",
    "these excited states are like resonances having finite band width and contributions from many discrete states calculated microscopically within the pn - qrpa framework",
    ". the construction of these excited states and calculation of the relevant nuclear matrix elements will be shown in the next section . in this sense",
    "the pn - qrpa model allows a fully microscopic `` state - by - state '' calculation of stellar weak rates .",
    "the calculation of stellar weak rates on iron - regime nuclei are sensitive to both the weak low - energy and strong high - energy ground and parent excited state gt strength distributions .",
    "the low energy part is more important during the earlier phase and the high energy part becomes important during the late phases of stellar evolution @xcite .",
    "previous pn - qrpa calculations have shown that for certain nuclei the excited state rates can command the total weak rate ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this clearly endorses the contribution of excited states in the calculation of total weak rates .",
    "other calculations revert to approximations like the so - called brink s hypothesis ( in the electron capture direction ) and back - resonances ( in the @xmath0-decay direction ) .",
    "brink s hypothesis states that gt strength distribution on excited states is _ identical _ to that from ground state , shifted _ only _ by the excitation energy of the state .",
    "gt back resonances are the states reached by the strong gt transitions in the inverse process ( electron capture ) built on ground and excited states .    nabi and klapdor - kleingrothaus @xcite first reported the calculation of weak interaction rates for 709 nuclei with a = 18 to 100 in stellar environment using the pn - qrpa theory .",
    "these included capture rates , decay rates , gamma heating rates , neutrino energy loss rates , probabilities of beta - delayed particle emissions and energy rate of these particle emissions .",
    "the authors then presented a detailed calculation of stellar weak interaction rates over a wide range of temperature and density scale for sd- @xcite and fp / fpg - shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "these also included the weak interaction rates for nuclei with a = 40 to 44 ( not yet calculated by shell model ) . since then these calculations were further refined with use of more efficient algorithms , computing power , incorporation of latest data from mass compilations and experimental values , and fine - tuning of model parameters both in the sd- shell @xcite and fp - shell @xcite region .",
    "all theoretical calculations of stellar weak interactions have inherent uncertainties .",
    "the uncertainties associated with the pn - qrpa model were discussed in detail in ref .",
    "the reliability of the pn - qrpa calculation was discussed in length by nabi and klapdor - kleingrothaus @xcite . there",
    "the authors compared the measured data ( half lives and b(gt@xmath6 ) strength ) of thousands of nuclide with the pn - qrpa calculation and got fairly good comparison .",
    "earlier half - lives of @xmath14 decays were calculated systematically for about 6000 neutron - rich nuclei between the beta stability line and the neutron drip line using the pn - qrpa model @xcite .",
    "similarly half - lives for @xmath15/ec ( electron capture ) decays for neutron - deficient nuclei with atomic numbers z = 10 - 108 were calculated up to the proton drip line for more than 2000 nuclei using the same model @xcite .",
    "these microscopic calculations gave a remarkably good agreement with the then existing experimental data ( within a factor of two for more than 90@xmath16 ( 73@xmath16 ) of nuclei with experimental half - lives shorter than 1 s for @xmath14 ( @xmath15/ec ) decays ) .",
    "most nuclei of interest of astrophysical importance are the ones far from stability and one has to rely on theoretical models to estimate their beta decay properties .",
    "the accuracy of the pn - qrpa model increases with increasing distance from the @xmath0-stability line ( shorter half - lives ) @xcite .",
    "this is a promising feature with respect to the prediction of experimentally unknown half - lives ( specially those present in the stellar interior ) , implying that the predictions are made on the basis of a realistic physical model .",
    "the isotopes of iron , @xmath3fe , are mainly responsible for decreasing the electron - to - baryon ratio during the oxygen and silicon burning phases of massive stars through electron capture and positron decay processes .",
    "the electron captures on these iron isotopes are the dominant process .",
    "nevertheless , the @xmath0-decay rates for these isotopes of iron are also argued to be relevant during the presupernova evolution of massive stars in literature .",
    "because of their astrophysical importance @xmath4fe were included in the list of key @xmath0-decay nuclei that have a significant impact on the presupernova evolution of massive stars after core silicon burning for @xmath17 compiled by aufderheide and collaborators ( see tables 19 , 20 and 26 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . later heger and collaborators @xcite studied the presupernova evolution of massive stars ( of masses @xmath18 and @xmath19 ) and found @xmath20fe in the list of top five nuclei that increase @xmath1 via @xmath0-decay and positron capture during the silicon burning phases of these massive stars .",
    "the authors employed the lssm @xmath0-decay rates in their simulation code .",
    "the calculations of gt@xmath6 strength distributions and stellar weak rates for these isotopes of iron were introduced earlier using the pn - qrpa theory with improved model parameters @xcite . there",
    "the author was able to reproduce fairly well the experimental centroids and the total strength distributions in both directions for the even - even iron isotopes , @xmath21fe where measurements were available . in this paper",
    "i discuss in detail the calculation of @xmath2 decay rates of @xmath3fe in stellar environment and its astrophysical implications .",
    "the main finding of this work is that @xmath0-decay rates on @xmath3fe are around 3  5 orders of magnitude smaller than previously assumed and are irrelevant for the determination of the evolution of @xmath1 during the presupernova phases of massive stars .    in the following section",
    "i briefly describe the theoretical formalism used to calculate the stellar electron and positron decay rates .",
    "the stellar @xmath2-decay rates of @xmath3fe are presented in section 3 . here",
    "i also compare the pn - qrpa decay rates with earlier calculations .",
    "summary and conclusions are finally presented in section 4 .",
    "the calculation may be divided into three main steps .",
    "a bogoliubov transformation was used to define quasiparticle states in terms of nucleon states and then the rpa equation was solved in the basis of proton - neutron quasiparticle pairs .",
    "the last step was to calculate the decay rates in stellar interior .",
    "the hamiltonian for the calculation was of the form @xmath22 the first step was approximated by a nilsson + bcs calculation .",
    "single - particle energies and wave functions were calculated in the nilsson model , which takes into account nuclear deformation @xcite .",
    "pairing was treated in the bcs approximation . in the second step regarding the rpa calculation , both particle - hole ( ph ) and",
    "particle - particle ( pp ) gt forces were employed .",
    "the gt forces are appropriate for calculation of gt strength functions , since the transition amplitudes are closely connected to the forces .",
    "the particle - particle interaction , first considered by cha @xcite , has usually been neglected in @xmath14 decay ( e.g. @xcite ) but is of decisive importance in @xmath15 decay ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "both the particle - hole and particle - particle interaction can be given a separable form .",
    "the interactions were characterized by two interaction constants : @xmath23 ( for particle - hole interaction ) and @xmath24 ( for particle - particle interaction ) . in this work ,",
    "the values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 were taken as 0.15 mev and 0.07 mev , respectively .",
    "the value of the strength parameters was determined by a fit to the measured data ( gt strengths and centroids ) available for the isotopic chain .",
    "other parameters required for the calculation of weak rates are the pairing gaps , the nuclear deformations and the q - value of the nuclear reactions .",
    "i applied the traditional choice of @xmath25 in this project @xcite .",
    "the deformation parameter was recently argued as an important parameter for qrpa calculations at par with the pairing parameter by stetcu and johnson @xcite . as such rather than using deformations from some theoretical mass model ( as used in earlier calculations of pn - qrpa weak rates @xcite ) the experimentally adopted values of the deformation parameters for @xmath21fe , extracted by relating the measured energy of the first @xmath26 excited state with the quadrupole deformation , were taken from raman et al .",
    "for the case of @xmath20fe ( where such measurement lacks ) the deformation of the nucleus was calculated as @xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the atomic and mass numbers , respectively , and @xmath30 is the electric quadrupole moment taken from ref .",
    "q - values were taken from the recent mass compilation of audi et al .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the incorporation of measured deformations for @xmath21fe and a smart choice of strength parameters led to an improvement of the calculated gt@xmath6 distributions compared to the measured ones .",
    "excited state calculation of gt@xmath6 strengths was performed for a total of 246 parent states in @xmath31fe , 297 states in @xmath20fe and 266 states in @xmath32fe , covering excitation energies in the vicinity of 15 mev ( as explained earlier ) .",
    "for each parent excited state , transitions were calculated to 150 daughter excited states .",
    "daughter excitation energies up to around 20 mev were considered in the calculation .",
    "the band widths of energy states were chosen according to the density of states of the concerned nucleus . in this way contribution from all excited states",
    "was incorporated in the calculation . a large model space assists in reproducing low - lying spectrum and higher excitations @xcite . the use of a separable interaction assisted in the incorporation of a luxurious model space of up to 7 major oscillator shells which in turn made possible to consider these many excited states in both parent and daughter nuclei . in order to further increase the reliability of the calculated rates experimental data were incorporated in the calculation wherever possible .",
    "the calculated excitation energies were replaced with measured levels when they were within 0.5 mev of each other .",
    "missing measured states were inserted and inverse transitions ( along with their log@xmath33 values ) were also taken into account .",
    "no theoretical levels were replaced with the experimental ones beyond the excitation energy for which experimental compilations had no definite spin and/or parity .",

    "the comparison study of stellar @xmath0-decay rates of iron isotopes suggests that the lssm @xmath0-decay rates are bigger than the corresponding pn - qrpa rates by 3  5 orders of magnitude .",
    "earlier using the same model the electron capture rates due to @xmath3fe were calculated and were found to be in overall good comparison with the lssm electron capture rates @xcite .",
    "in fact the pn - qrpa electron capture rates on @xmath31fe were around a factor three bigger than lssm rates in the relevant astrophysical conditions ( see table  3 of ref .",
    "@xcite ) . using the same model , however , the calculated @xmath0-decay rates are smaller by 3  5 orders of magnitude .",
    "this suppression in the pn - qrpa @xmath0-decay rates comes from the excited state gt distributions ( smaller nuclear matrix elements ) which are much different from the ground state distribution . in order to gain a detailed insight of these distributions i took a representative temperature and density point of t@xmath101 = 10 and @xmath95 = 10^{7}$ ] ( weak interaction rates due to iron isotopes",

    "these are mainly responsible for the smaller total @xmath0-decay rates .",
    "the excited state gt strength distributions are also much different from the ground state distribution for the case of @xmath20fe . the excited state gt distributions for @xmath3fe are shown graphically in figures  [ fig13 ] , [ fig14 ] and [ fig15 ] , respectively .",

    "note the different scales of the b(gt ) strength values in the vertical panels of these figures . from these figures",
    "it is clear that the brink s hypothesis ( and back resonances for the calculation of @xmath0-decay ) is not a good approximation for calculation of stellar weak interaction rates of iron isotopes .",
    "these and similar finite partial decay rates lead to an overall suppression in the total @xmath0-decay rate which happens to be 5.44e-09 @xmath91 , 4.32e-07 @xmath91 and 2.62e-05 @xmath91 for @xmath31fe , @xmath20fe and @xmath32fe , respectively , under the physical conditions stated above .",

    "<S> @xmath0-decay and positron decay are believed to play a consequential role during the late phases of stellar evolution of a massive star culminating in a supernova explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0-decay contributes in maintaining a respectable lepton - to - baryon ratio , @xmath1 , of the core prior to collapse which results in a larger shock energy to produce the explosion . </S>",
    "<S> the positron decay acts in the opposite direction and tends to decrease the ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the structure of the presupernova star is altered both by the changes in @xmath1 and the entropy of the core material . </S>",
    "<S> recently the microscopic calculation of weak - interaction mediated rates on key isotopes of iron was introduced using the proton - neutron quasiparticle random phase approximation ( pn - qrpa ) theory with improved model parameters . here </S>",
    "<S> i discuss in detail the improved calculation of @xmath2 decay rates for iron isotopes ( @xmath3fe ) in stellar environment . </S>",
    "<S> the pn - qrpa theory allows a microscopic `` state - by - state '' calculation of stellar rates as explained later in text . </S>",
    "<S> excited state gamow - teller distributions are much different from ground state and a microscopic calculation of decay rates from these excited states greatly increases the reliability of the total decay rate calculation specially during the late stages of stellar evolution . </S>",
    "<S> the reported decay rates are also compared with earlier calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the positron decay rates are in reasonable agreement with the large - scale shell model calculation . </S>",
    "<S> the main finding of this work includes that the stellar @xmath0-decay rates of @xmath3fe are around 3  5 orders of magnitude smaller than previously assumed and hence irrelevant for the determination of the evolution of @xmath1 during the presupernova phase of massive stars . </S>",
