    "although the evidence for neutrino oscillation is growing year after year , the final proof that the observed anomalies are due to oscillation is still outstanding .",
    "alternative models ( neutrino decay , potential decoherence effect , influence of large extra - dimensions ) to explain the super - kamiokande ( sk ) atmospheric neutrinos results have been proposed . on the experimental side , as pointed out also in recent neutrino 2000 conclusions `` _ there is as yet no direct evidence of an oscillation pattern _ '' @xcite and the oscillation parameters in the atmospheric sector are still measured with a poor precision .",
    "the  experiment has been designed exactly to reach these physics goals , that is prove @xmath1 oscillations through the observation of the oscillation pattern and improve the measurements of parameters affecting the oscillations ( if oscillation is the pysical case ) .",
    "the experimental method that is proposed is designed to overcome the limits of current atmospheric neutrino experiments through a systematic free and monte carlo independent measurements of the parameters .",
    "will also test the ( now disfavored ) hypothesis of mixing with sterile neutrinos searching for matter induced effects .",
    "further items of research , not discussed here , are the use of the huge sample of events coming from the cngs beam to complement the atmospheric neutrino sample , the measurement of the cosmic muon spectrum at tev energies and the use of the detector as a muon charge - id detector for a beam coming from a @xmath1-factory .

    "to explicitly detect an oscillation pattern in the @xmath0 spectrum of atmospheric muon neutrinos , the energy @xmath2 and direction @xmath3 of the incoming neutrino have to be measured in each event .",
    "the latter can be estimated from the direction @xmath4 of the muon produced from the @xmath5 charged - current interaction .",
    "the neutrino energy @xmath2 can be obtained by means of energy measurements of the muon @xmath6 and of the hadrons produced in the interaction ( @xmath7 ) . in order to make the oscillation pattern detectable",
    ", the @xmath0 ratio has to be measured with a fwhm error smaller than half of the modulation period .",
    "the resolution on @xmath0 improves at high energies , mostly because the muon direction gives a better estimate of the neutrino direction .",
    "therefore the ability to measure high momentum muons ( in the multi - gev range ) in partially contained events , which is rather limited in the on - going atmospheric neutrino experiments , is particularly rewarding",
    ".    a complete description of the detector structure can be found in @xcite .",
    "the apparatus consists of two modules , a stack of 125 horizontal 8 cm thick iron plates each with a surface of 15.0@xmath814.5 m@xmath9 , interleaved with 2.2 cm gaps housing the sensitive elements .",
    "the main detector parameters and resolutions are summarized in table 1 .",
    "taking into account needs of such a large area detector and fast mass production , glass spark counters @xcite , derived from resistive - plate chambers , have been chosen as active elements .",
    "the magnetization of iron plates is obtained through a vertical slot crossing all the stack : each field line lays entirely inside an individual plane .",
    "[ figure : accmag ]    to avoid systematic effects and monte carlo dependencies , we use the ratio between the measured down - going neutrino flux as a _ near _ unoscillated reference flux and the upward neutrinos flux as a _",
    "far _ oscillated one .",
    "thus we associate for each downward neutrino its _ mirror _ pathlength , as originally proposed in @xcite .",
    "this method is to a large extent insensitive to uncertainties in the knowledge of atmospheric neutrino fluxes and neutrino cross sections as well detector inefficiencies .",
    "it is based on the up / down symmetry of the neutrino fluxes , which holds at typical  energies ( @xmath10 gev ) . in this framework ,",
    "the atmospheric neutrinos represent an ideal case for a disappearance experiment .",
    "the event selection has been tuned to obtain the @xmath0 resolution required to detect the pattern .",
    "muons are reconstructed or via energy loss in the iron or via magnetic analysis .",
    "minimal requirements have been applied to the reconstructed muon momentum ( @xmath11 gev ) and , for outgoing muons , to the track - length @xmath12 ( @xmath13 m ) .",
    "additional cuts ( for details see @xcite ) on combinations of the observables @xmath6 , @xmath14 and @xmath4 are applied to ensure the required @xmath0 resolution and on visible vertex coordinates , muon direction , external veto information to reject the cosmic muon background . with these cuts",
    ", we expect in 4 years of data taking ( see fig .",
    "1 ) to select for physical analysis @xmath15 1200 events ( 80% fully contained and 20% partially contained ) of down - going @xmath5 ( in case of no oscillation this number is the same for up - going ) .",
    "[ figure : pattern ]    the gain in acceptance at small values of @xmath0 due to the magnetic field analysis is noteworthy : as shown in fig .  1 the inclusion of partially contained events increases the  selection efficiency by more than a factor two in the region where the first semi - period of the oscillation is expected according to the sk results .",
    "the cost of the magnetization , when compared to the whole cost , is around 8% , but , in practice , has an effect similar to that of doubling the total mass .    in fig .",
    "2 we show , for a particular choice of oscillation parameters , how  detects the oscillation pattern using the ratio between up - going and down - going events . note that around @xmath16ev@xmath9  can measure the @xmath17 value with 6% precision",

    "is able to reject the decay hypothesis at 95% c.l . or better with 99.5% efficiency .",
    "3 the expected allowed regions of the @xmath18 oscillation parameters after 4 years of data taking with   are shown for four different values of @xmath17 . it is worthwhile to note that the progress in the knowledge of the @xmath17 expected by  with respect to sk , is quantitatively similar to the one done by sk with respect to kamiokande .",

    "have been carried out during the last two years at lngs and cern / ps to study up / down discrimination and hadronic energy resolution .",
    "assuming approval in early 2001 , the first module is foreseen to be operational by the end of 2004 and the detector to be completed by the end of 2006 .",
    "the superior l / e resolution of the detector will allow detection of the first oscillation period .  will thus prove ( or disprove ) the oscillation hypothesis .",
    "it will also highly improve the measurement of the oscillation parameters .",
    "these qualitative and quantitative improvements qualify  as a next generation neutrino oscillation detector .",
