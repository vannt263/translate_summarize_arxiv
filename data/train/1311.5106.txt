    "the discovery of a new gauge boson has been reported by cms and atlas collaborations at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite . at present ,",
    "its properties are found to be remarkably similar to standard model ( sm ) higgs  @xcite .",
    "to know more of its properties becomes a paramount task , since if we know it well , we may decide whether there is really new physics beyond sm and to determine further what s the new physics could be like .",
    "the higgs decay channel , @xmath0 , which provides a dominant role for the discovery of higgs boson , shall be of great importance for revealing detailed properties of higgs boson at the lhc or future collider experiments .",
    "the recent updates on higgs boson search show that the signal significance of @xmath0 channel are @xmath10 for cms  @xcite and @xmath11 for atlas  @xcite .",
    "the decay width @xmath12 also enters into the cross section for higgs - boson production through photon - photon fusion , then , it could also be helpful for future high energy @xmath13 colliders as international linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite or the higgs factory .",
    "therefore , it is important to study this decay channel as precise as possible .    theoretically , within the sm model , the decay of higgs boson into photons is mediated though either @xmath14 boson or heavy fermions at least at the one - loop level , whose total decay rate can be generally written as @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 corresponding to top quark , bottom quark , charm quark and @xmath19 lepton , respectively .",
    "the electroweak @xmath14 boson loop provides dominant contribution to the process , which is about @xmath20 times larger than that of the top - quark loop .",
    "the fermionic contributions are proportional to an overall factor @xmath21 , which indicates that the fermionic contributions are dominated by top - quark loop and the contributions from the light fermions as @xmath22 or @xmath23 quarks can be safely neglected , especially for their higher loop corrections .    because of its importance , in the literature",
    ", many efforts have been made on studying the higgs decays into two photons , e.g. the one - loop estimation can be found in refs.@xcite , the two - loop estimation can be found in refs.@xcite , and the electroweak corrections at the two - loop level have also been analyzed in refs.@xcite .",
    "most importantly , three - loop non - singlet qcd correction has been given in ref.@xcite , and recently , a complete three - loop correction including both singlet and non - singlet qcd corrections has been done by ref.@xcite .",
    "all those improvements provide us a great chance for deriving more accurate estimation on higgs properties , as is the purposes of our present paper .",
    "it is conventional to choose a typical momentum transfer of the process as the renormalization scale and take an arbitrary range to estimate the uncertainty in the qcd prediction .",
    "as is well - known , under such conventional scale setting , there is renormalization scale and renormalization scheme ambiguities at any finite order .",
    "it is often argued that by varying the renormalization scale , one can estimate contributions from higher - order terms .",
    "however , this procedure only exposes the @xmath1-dependent nonconformal terms , not the entire perturbative series .",
    "and the prediction of conventional scale setting is usually wrong in qed where there is never a scale uncertainty .",
    "further more , the value of @xmath24 entering the qcd @xmath25-function is not determined by using conventional scale setting .",
    "a recent review on this point can be found in ref.@xcite .",
    "it has been suggested that the principle of maximum conformality ( pmc ) provides a possible solution for eliminating renormalization scale ambiguity  @xcite , which also provides a principle to set the optimal renormalization scales up to all orders and to set the value of @xmath24 entering the qcd @xmath25-function at each perturbative order . in the present paper",
    ", we shall adopt pmc to eliminate the renormalization scale ambiguity for @xmath0 . for the purpose",
    ", one can first finish the renormalization procedure by using an arbitrary initial scale @xmath26 , and then set the effective or optimal pmc scales for the process by absorbing all non - conformal terms into the coupling constant via an order - by - order manner .",
    "it is noted that the pmc satisfies all self - consistency conditions for setting the renormalization scale , and the qcd predictions under pmc are then independent of renormalization scheme .",
    "because of these merits , the pmc method can be widely applied to high energy physics processes , some of its applications have already been shown in the literature  @xcite .    in principle , the scale dependence of the strong coupling constant is controlled by the renormalization group equation ( rge ) via the @xmath25 function , i.e. , @xmath27 where various terms in @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , correspond to one - loop and two - loop @xmath30 contributions respectively . if one can find a proper way to sum up all known - type of @xmath1-terms into the coupling constant , then one can determine the effective coupling for a specific process definitely at each perturbative order , and thus , the renormalization scale dependence can be greatly suppressed or even be eliminated . the pmc has been designed for such purpose . as an important point of deriving reliable pmc estimation ,",
    "it is noted that only those non - conformal @xmath1-terms that rightly determine the running behavior of the coupling constant via rge should be absorbed into the coupling constant to form a conformal series . those unrelated @xmath1-terms that are from the quark mass renormalization and etc . should be kept as a separate during pmc scale setting . since all @xmath1-terms are entangled with each other",
    ", one should find a proper way to deal with each types via a confidential way . in this paper , by suggesting an unambiguous way to carefully deal with the @xmath1-terms",
    ", we shall make a detailed pmc analysis on higgs decay @xmath0 up to three - loop qcd corrections .",
    "the remaining parts of this paper are organized as follows . in sec.[sec:2 ] , we present the calculation technology for the higgs decay @xmath0 up to three - loop qcd corrections under the pmc scale setting , in which we suggest a new way to set the pmc scales for high energy processes unambiguously . in sec.[sec:3 ] , we present the numerical results and discussions .",
    "the sec.[sec:4 ] is reserved for a summary .",
    "the pmc scales of the process can be determined by absorbing @xmath31-terms into the coupling constant . it is noted that the three - loop expressions presented in ref.@xcite are calculated under the @xmath2 scheme and are given for the top quark @xmath2 mass ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "then , the @xmath1-terms for both the top - quark anomalous dimension and the qcd @xmath25-function are entangled with each other .",
    "this makes it hard to set pmc scales in an unambiguous way . to solve the problem",
    ", we suggest to transform expressions in the terms of @xmath32 into those of the top quark on - shell mass ( @xmath33 ) . after doing such transformation ,",
    "all remaining @xmath1-terms are rightly pertained to the coupling constant and the pmc scales can be readily determined .",
