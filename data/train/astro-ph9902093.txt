    "the qso 3c345 ( @xmath2=16@xmath3 , @xmath4=0.595 ) is one of the best examples of a radio source jet in a core - dominated radio source .",
    "it has been monitored with vlbi since 1979 @xcite .",
    "on arcsecond scales the source contains a compact region at the base of a 4@xmath5 jet that is embedded in a diffuse steep - spectrum halo @xcite .",
    "> from astrometric measurements , the parsec - scale core has been shown to be stationary within uncertainties of 20@xmath6asyr@xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the parsec - scale jet consists of several prominent enhanced emission regions ( jet components ) apparently ejected at different position angles ( p.a.ranging from 240@xmath8 to 290@xmath8 ) with respect to the jet core .",
    "the components move along curved trajectories that can be modelled by a simple helical jet .",
    "the curvature of the trajectories may be caused by some periodic process at the jet origin , like orbital motion in a binary black hole system or kelvin - helmholtz instabilities @xcite .",
    "3c345 was observed with vlbi during the first half of the 90 s almost every 6 months at different frequencies .",
    "the component motions were well monitored through these observations ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) allowing precise determination of component motions .",
    "the present work extends this effort with an enhanced data set at four frequencies , including polarization data .    assuming a standard friedmann cosmology , with @xmath9=100@xmath10kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 and @xmath11=0.5 , an angular scale of 1mas corresponds to 3.79@xmath12pc for a cosmological redshift of 0.595 .",
    "an apparent angular motion of 1masyr@xmath7 represents an apparent speed of @xmath13=19.7@xmath12 .",
    "we observed 3c345 with the vlba at 3 epochs ( 1995.84 , 1996.41 , and 1996.81 ) at 22 , 15 , 8.4 , and 5ghz , using a bandwidth of 16mhz . at each frequency , the source was observed for about 14hrs , using 5-minute scans and interleaving all observing frequencies .",
    "some calibrator scans ( on 3c279 , 3c84 , nrao91 , oq208 , and 3c286 ) were inserted during the observations .",
    "the data were correlated at the nrao vlba correlator in socorro , new mexico , usa .",
    "the data were fringe - fitted and calibrated in aips and imaged using the differential mapping program difmap @xcite .",
    "high dynamic range images ( 1:1000 ) were obtained for all epochs and frequencies . at the higher frequencies ( 15 and 22ghz )",
    ", we identified the core d and two main components ( tentatively identified as c8 and c7 ) in the inner 3mas @xcite . the components travel outwards with respect to the core , with observed apparent superluminal speeds of about 5@xmath0 . at 5 and 8.4ghz",
    "the jet extends up to 20mas distances from the core .",
    "[ fig : maps-8.4 - 5 ] shows the images at 8.4 and 5ghz for all 3 observing epochs .",
    "model fitting of gaussian profile components to the jet at 5 and 8.4ghz includes the inner components seen at the higher frequencies , and additionally more extended components of the jet further out .",
    "the proper motions of these regions are typically of @xmath144.5@xmath0 . at @xmath146.2mas from the core ( p.a .",
    "@xmath15 ) the emission can be fitted for the six images with a component , having a total flux density of @xmath140.6jy at 8.4ghz and @xmath140.7jy at 5ghz .",
    "the proper motion for this component is @xmath146@xmath0 .",
    "it is most plausibly identified with the c4 component discussed by , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "component c2 is fitted at a position @xmath1412mas away from the core ( p.a .",
    "@xmath15 ) , with a flux density of @xmath140.1jy both at 8.4 and 5ghz .",
    "the extended nature of this component makes proper motion determinations very uncertain . at 5ghz",
    "another component , c1 , separated @xmath1420mas from the core ( p.a .",
    "@xmath16 ) , with a flux density above 0.2jy for all three epochs , permits us to trace the northern extended jet emission ( the fwhm of the elliptical component is about 10mas ) .",
    "a comparison with previous model - fitting results will provide a better understanding of the kinematic properties of the jet .",
    "recently , important progress has been done in the vlbi polarimetric observations .",
    "the polarization calibration at high frequencies is now possible using the target source itself as a calibrator @xcite .",
    "this technique is non - iterative and is insensitive to structure in the polarization calibrator .",
    "we have applied this approach to determine the instrumental polarization of the observing stations and to image the linear polarization in 3c345 .",
    "we do not apply faraday rotation to the observed electric vector position angles presented here , relying on the results of @xcite , who reports small rotation measurements in 3c345 at frequencies higher than 5ghz .",
    "in @xcite we show some polarization results of this monitoring at 22ghz , where the electric vector is roughly parallel to the jet direction in the inner part of the jet .",
    "@xcite report similar vector alignment with the jet at 43ghz , for some blazars in the inner jet regions . at lower frequencies ,",
    "the distribution of the polarized emission differs significantly from that seen at 22 and 15ghz .",
    "the core is less polarized ( @xmath17@xmath141% ) than at higher frequencies , showing an electric vector oblique to the jet direction .",
    "both facts may be caused by the blending of differently oriented polarized components .",
    "the degree of polarization at 5ghz in the jet reaches values over 15% .",
    "we present an image of the third epoch of our monitoring in fig .",
    "[ fig : c - pol ] . both previous epochs display very similar features for the jet .    ) overlaid on total intensity ( @xmath18 ) contours and grey scale polarized intensity ( @xmath19 ) images for 3c345 .",
    "( @xmath20 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are stokes parameters , @xmath23 is the polarized linear intensity , @xmath17 is the fractional linear polarization , and @xmath24 is the position angle of the electric vector in the sky ) .",
    "it is obvious that the electric vector is almost perpendicular to the jet at core separations from 3 to 7mas . ]",
    "these findings seem to be consistent with the conclusions of @xcite , who reported , at 5ghz , a weakly polarized core in 3c345 and a fractional polarization reaching 15% in the jet .",
    "the electric vector position angles were found to be variable in the core from one epoch to the other but perpendicular to the jet for all epochs .",
    "the images obtained by @xcite at 8.4ghz are similar to our results , and also imply a magnetic field aligned with the jet direction at 3 - 10mas distances from the core .",
    "@xcite suggested that the longitudinal component of the magnetic field can increase with the distance from the core as a result of shear from the dense emission line gas near the nucleus . at larger distances from the core",
    "the shocks may be too weak to dominate the underlying field , resulting in the observed electric field perpendicular to the jet .",
    "we have studied the qso 3c345 with the vlba at three epochs and four frequencies , analyzing the properties of its total intensity and polarized emission .",
    "we have monitored the kinematics of the radio source , identifying components and proper motions .",
    "the polarized intensity images show the alignment between the jet direction and the electric vector position angle in the inner regions of the jet at high frequencies , and the orthogonality of the electric vector to the jet direction in the outer regions of the jet .",
    "these results confirm reliably the previously reported observations @xcite covering different frequencies and jet regions in 3c345 .    continuing the multiband monitoring of 3c345 with vlbi , enhanced by regular polarimetric studies , can provide important clues on the physics of the parsec - scale jet . higher frequencies and better resolution observations ( as those provided by orbital vlbi results with halca ) should help to better constrain the models of this qso .",
