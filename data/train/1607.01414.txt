    "in biological systems , proteins rarely act as isolated monomers and association to dimers or higher oligomers is a commonly observed phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "recent structural and biophysical studies show that protein dimerization or oligomerization is a key factor in the regulation of proteins such as enzymes  @xcite , ion channels@xcite , receptors and transcription factors  @xcite .",
    "in addition , this mechanism can help to minimize genome size , while preserving the advantages of modular complex formation@xcite .",
    "oligomerization , however , can also have deleterious consequences when non - native oligomers , associated with pathogenic states , are generated@xcite .",
    "specific protein dimerization is integral to biological function , structure and control , and must be under substantial selection pressure to be maintained with such frequency in living organisms",
    ".    protein - protein interactions may occur between identical or non - identical chains ( homo or hetero - oligomers ) and the association can be permanent or transient@xcite .",
    "protein complexes can widely differ based on their affinity .",
    "binding affinities , evaluated for dimers as dissociation constants , can cover up to nine orders of magnitude , highlighting the fact that a strong modulation is necessary to hold up the full protein interaction network@xcite .",
    "the mechanisms for the evolution of oligomeric interfaces and those for the assembly of oligomers during protein synthesis or refolding remain unclear .",
    "different paradigms have been proposed for the evolution of protein oligomers , among which figures three - dimensional ( 3d ) domain swapping  @xcite .",
    "three - dimensional domain swapping is a mechanism through which two or more protein molecules form a dimer or higher oligomer by exchanging an identical structural element ( see figures  [ fig : ex1 ] and  [ fig : ex2 ] ) .",
    "several native ( natural / physiological ) intra - molecular interactions within the monomeric structures are replaced by inter - molecular interactions of protein structures in swapped oligomeric conformations@xcite .",
    "critical in this process is the hinge region , the only polypeptide segment that needs to adopt different conformations in the monomer and in the domain - swapped oligomer .",
    "domain swapping is typically the response of the protein to relieve conformational stress that is present in this hinge region of the monomer .",
    "structures in swapped conformations were reported to perform a variety of functions , and proteins involved in deposition diseases ( like neurodegenerative diseases , amyloidosis and alzheimer s disease ) have been reported in 3d domain - swapped conformations@xcite .",
    "domain - swapped proteins may assume rather complicated spatial structures , since the swapping arms in their rotation can wind up forming tightly compenetrated structures .",
    "examples are shown in figure  [ fig : ex1 ] and figure  [ fig : ex2 ] .",
    "for instance , the staphylococcus aureus thioredoxin ( trx ) fold mutant ( pdb code 3die ) represented in figure  [ fig : ex2 ] clearly illustrates the deep clinging between the two proteins .",
    "the apparent intertwining between proteins assembled in complexes is certainly a distinguishing characteristic of these systems .",
    "an interesting issue to explore is the possibility of introducing topology - based descriptors that can capture the entanglement in a robust and measurable way , and that can be related to either some physico / chemical properties or biological functionalities .",
    "for instance , for single chain globular proteins it has been observed that the backbones may entangle themselves into a physical knot  @xcite that does not disentangle even in the denatured unfolded state  @xcite .",
    "knotted proteins are interesting because they are rare , and their folding mechanisms and function are not well understood , although it has been proposed that they might increase thermal and kinetic stability  @xcite .",
    "although knots are mathematically defined only for closed loops  @xcite , in the last decade there have been several attempts to introduce sufficiently robust and topologically inspired measures of knots in open chains  @xcite . for a single protein , for instance",
    ", one can close its backbone by connecting the n and c termini to a point ( chosen randomly ) on the surface of a sphere that contains the chain .",
    "this sphere can be either very large compared to the chain size ( closure at infinity ) or it can be replaced by the convex hull of the chain . in all cases",
    "the artificial closure can introduce additional entanglement and there have been suggested several ways to either mitigate or control this problem  @xcite    for two proteins forming a dimer , if one is interested in measuring the degree of mutual entanglement , the notion of a knotted open chain must be generalised to that of a link between two open chains . in analogy with the procedure used for knots , one can think of closing artificially the two backbones to generate two loops .",
    "this can be done by joining the ends of each protein at infinity and computing a link invariant , such as the linking number @xmath3 , an integer index that    quantifies the number of times that a curve winds around the other ( technically , with gauss integrals evaluated over the protein backbone , @xmath3 detects the degree of homological linking between two closed curves  @xcite and can be used to classify proteins  @xcite ) .",
    "two curves are not linked if @xmath4 while @xmath5 or @xmath6 denotes the simplest link between two loops . since the sign of @xmath7 depends on the orientation of the two curves , in our implementation we choose to follow the standard n - c orientation along the backbones of the proteins . as in knots ,",
    "the random closure may introduce additional linking between the two chains and an estimate of @xmath7 is necessarily a probabilistic one that requires a sufficiently large number of closure paths  @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath8 the average of the linking number @xmath3 over many closures . along with @xmath8",
    ", we consider a _",
    "gaussian entanglement _",
    "indicator , @xmath0 , computed with the same method adopted for @xmath8 but without closing the curves .",
    "we show that @xmath0 strongly correlates with its topological counterpart @xmath8 .",
    "both estimators are used to analyse a non - redundant set of 3d domain swapped dimers .",
    "it turns out that several dimers present a high degree of mutual entanglement .",
    "the short cpu time required to estimate @xmath0 allows a quick systematic mining of linked dimers from protein databanks . with a computationally much heavier test , for some dimers we check whether this measure of entanglement is robust or is just an artifact of the specific crystallographic structure found in the database .",
    "this is done by performing simplified molecular dynamics simulations , starting from several native structures with non - trivial values of @xmath0 .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath9 during the process of dissociation of the dimer reveals additional information on the amount of intertwining of the two proteins .",
    ".*domain - swapped dimers ranked from lowest to highest gaussian entanglement @xmath0 . * the mean linking number ( @xmath8 ) and the number of amino acids in each protein of the dimer ( @xmath10 ) are also reported for the analysed dimers .",
    "human proteins are tagged with a `` h '' . [",
    "tab : g1 g ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,>,<,<,<,<,>,<,<,<,<,>,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : tau ]",
    "mathematically , two curves are linked or not , in a rigorous sense , only if they are loops . hence , it is not trivial to estimate the level of intertwining between two open chains . yet , the mutual entanglement is a well - visible feature in the crystallographic structures of several domain - swapped dimers .",
    "being interested in quantifying such entanglement , with gauss double integrals over the backbones of the two proteins in the dimers we provide a simple and efficient indicator , the gaussian entanglement @xmath0 . indeed , according to our comparisons , a procedure for looping each protein ( with an artificial continuation escaping from the core of the dimer ) produces on average a linking number @xmath8 that is strongly correlated with @xmath0 .",
    "this suggests that such procedure can be avoided in practice , one may just rely on the information from the open chains , encoded in @xmath0 .",
    "we report that about @xmath11 of the domain - swapped dimers have a significant @xmath12 .",
    "this is quite intriguing , especially if compared with corresponding figures for knotting of single proteins , where about @xmath13% of the pdb entries has been found to host a knot  @xcite .",
    "the asymmetry in the typical values of @xmath0 , with many more cases with @xmath14 than with @xmath15 , is another interesting feature emerging from our analysis .",
    "this asymmetry could be explained by the conjecture that the gaussian entanglement , despite being a global feature , can be deduced from the local twisting of closely interacting swapped structural elements . in several cases the latter are @xmath16-strands within the same sheet ( see for example 1mod , 1lgp in figure 1 and 3die , 1wkq in figure 2 ) , so that the more frequent case of a right - handed anti - parallel @xmath16-sheet @xcite would indeed imply a negative gaussian entanglement . with a preliminary overview ,",
    "we note that anti - parallel swapped @xmath16-sheets are indeed occurring more frequently in the human dimers of our database than in the non - human ones , and human dimers have indeed on average a more negative @xmath0 .",
    "the dependence of the intertwining of domain - swapped protein dimers on the local twist of swapped interacting elements is a feature clearly worth further investigation .",
    "if confirmed , the tuning of local interactions could then be an evolutionary mechanism used by natural selection to control the emergence of topological entanglement in domain - swapped dimers .",
    "we also tried to investigate whether there is a correlation between entanglement and pathological states .",
    "however , our analysis of domain - swapped dimers associated with pathologies  @xcite does not show the emergence of any clear pattern",
    ".    the longer the proteins in the dimers , the slightly lower is their mutual entanglement .",
    "this is a surprising feature because one might anticipate that longer chains should be more easily entangled than shorter ones .",
    "thus , it seems that the natural selection has acted against a form of random interpenetration in long domain - swapped protein dimers .    via numerical simulations of the dissociation of some dimers",
    ", we observe that the presence of a non - trivial mutual entanglement is a robust characteristic , which vanishes exponentially with time during the dimer unbinding .",
    "the exponential fit furnishes a characteristic disentanglement time @xmath17 whose values does not depend on @xmath0 and is weakly correlated with the length of the proteins .",
    "the amplitude of the exponential decay of the gaussian entanglement furnishes a further estimate ( @xmath18 ) of the intertwining in the dimer , which complements the @xmath0 of the crystallographic structure ( they are not exactly equal to each other ) in assessing the amount of linking in the dimer .",
    "our new approach of classifying domain - swapped protein dimers according to their mutual entanglement will likely add novel insight on the crucial role played by the generic topological properties of linear polymer chains in the protein context . as already demonstrated in the case of knotted protein folds  @xcite , the presence of a global topological constraint , such as the linking between two protein chains , may strongly impact the conformational properties , the thermodynamic and kinetic stability , the functional and evolutionary role of domain - swapped structures .",
    "finally , it is interesting to speculate on the possible outcome of a single - molecule experiment performed by pulling apart the two protein backbones of a domain - swapped dimer with significant entanglement ( high @xmath19 ) . a similar experiment was carried on very recently for single - domain protein knots , showing that the knotting topology of the unfolded state can be controlled by varying the pulling direction  @xcite . in the linked dimer case ,",
    "similarly , we expect the choice of the pulling directions to be crucial in allowing or not dimer unlinking and dissociation into monomers .",
    "in order to derive a statistically significant ensemble of non - redundant domain - swapped dimers , we merge two existing databanks of domain - swapped proteins , namely _",
    "3dswap_@xcite and _ proswap_@xcite .",
    "these databanks provide curated information and various sequence and structural features about the proteins involved in the domain swapping phenomenon .",
    "pdb entries involved in 3d domain swapping are identified from integrated literature search and searches in pdb using advanced mining options .",
    "we first consider only the dimers and , to avoid the presence of related structures , we consider the uniprotkb code .",
    "for each code , we select only one protein , the one obtained experimentally with the highest experimental accuracy .",
    "we then filter the remaining structures to avoid the presence of holes in the main backbone chain . specifically , we discarded those proteins in which the distance between two @xmath20 , listed consecutively in the pdb file , is bigger than @xmath21   . as a matter of fact , such holes could affect dramatically the reliability of the linking number and there is not an obvious strategy to join them artificially . at the end we obtained a databank of @xmath22 proteins ,",
    "whose pdb code is reported in table  [ tab : g1 g ] . out of these , @xmath23",
    "were human .      our procedure for estimating the amount of linking between two proteins uses gauss integrals .",
    "as representative of the backbones of proteins , we consider the chains connecting the coordinates @xmath24 of the @xmath25 atoms of amino acids , which are @xmath10 in each of the two proteins in the dimer .    a definition of linking number between two closed curves @xmath26 and @xmath27 in @xmath28 dimensions is given by the gauss double integral , @xmath29 this formula yields integer numbers @xmath30 etc .",
    "such definition is adapted to compute the amount of linking between two proteins .",
    "we need first to define a procedure that closes each open chain via the addition of artificial residues .",
    "this closure starts by computing the center of mass of the dimer and by considering such center as a repeller for the new growing arms .",
    "let us describe the method for protein @xmath13 , as for protein @xmath31 it is exactly the same : from each of the two free ends we continue with a path expanding diametrically from the center of mass , with a length corresponding to @xmath32 typical @xmath25 - @xmath25 distances @xmath33  . at this stage",
    "the polymer is composed by @xmath34 residues . since there is some arbitrariness in the final closure joining the two artificial new end residues , we perform a statistics over @xmath35 different closures , each being a meridian along a sphere where the poles are the artificial end residues .",
    "semicircular closure paths are drawn , each containing a number of artificial residues @xmath36 that makes their bond distance as close as possible to @xmath37 .",
    "an example is shown in figure  [ fig : loop ] .",
    "each closed chain becomes a collection of @xmath38 points @xmath39 separated by about a fixed spacing @xmath40 , so that the integrals are replaced by sums over segments @xmath41 , for which we use the midpoint approximation @xmath42 . for a given choice @xmath43 of the closure for both proteins , out of the @xmath44 possible ones",
    ", we have @xmath45 ( indices run periodically , hence @xmath46 , and the notation leaves the dependence of @xmath47 s on @xmath43 understood ) , and the final estimate of linking is an average over @xmath48 closures @xmath49    a closure provides an integer linking number @xmath50 , though the final average @xmath8 may become not integer if closures with different @xmath50 are generated . as an alternative , we relax the requirement to have basic integer indicators of linking and we perform the double gauss discrete integral over the open chains .",
    "the gaussian entanglement indicator @xmath51 has no statistical averaging and is a straightforward alternative to @xmath8 in the estimate of the linking of proteins .      in our molecular dynamics simulations ,",
    "each protein forming the dimer is modeled as a self - avoiding chain of @xmath10 beads .",
    "each bead has radius @xmath52 and is centered in the @xmath53 position of a residue .",
    "adjacent beads of each protein are tethered together into a polymer chain by an harmonic potential with the average @xmath53-@xmath53 distance along the chain equal to @xmath54 . to take into account the excluded volume interaction between beads we consider the truncated lennard - jones potential    @xmath55 \\theta(2^{1/6 } \\sigma- d_{i , j } ) \\ ] ]    where @xmath56 is the distance of the bead centers @xmath57 and @xmath58 , @xmath59 is the heaviside function and @xmath60 is the characteristic unit of energy of the system which is set equal to the thermal energy @xmath61 .",
    "the system dynamics is described within a langevin scheme : @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the total potential of the @xmath57th particle , @xmath64 is the friction coefficient and @xmath65 is the stochastic delta - correlated noise .",
    "the variance of each cartesian component of the noise , @xmath66 satisfies the usual fluctuation dissipation relationship @xmath67 . as customary , we set @xmath68 , with @xmath69 being the characteristic simulation time . from the stokes friction coefficient of spherical beads of diameters",
    "@xmath52 we have @xmath70 , where @xmath65 is the solution viscosity . by using the nominal water viscosity , @xmath71cp and setting @xmath72k and @xmath73 nm , one has @xmath74ns .    to study the unfolding dynamics of a given dimer we take its folded configuration , as given by the pdb , as the initial condition .",
    "for each initial condition we generate 100 different molecular dynamics trajectories by integrating numerically  ( [ lang ] ) up to @xmath75 . during the dynamics",
    "we monitor the quantities @xmath8 and @xmath0 . in figure",

    "<S> the presence of knots has been observed in a small fraction of single - domain proteins and related to their thermodynamic and kinetic properties . </S>",
    "<S> the exchanging of identical structural elements , typical of domain - swapped proteins , make such dimers suitable candidates to validate the possibility that mutual entanglement between chains may play a similar role for protein complexes . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that such entanglement is captured by the linking number . </S>",
    "<S> this represents , for two closed curves , the number of times that each curve winds around the other . </S>",
    "<S> we show that closing the curves is not necessary , as a novel parameter @xmath0 , termed gaussian entanglement , is strongly correlated with the linking number . based on @xmath1 non redundant domain - swapped dimers , our analysis evidences a high fraction of chains with a significant intertwining , that is with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we report that nature promotes configurations with negative mutual entanglement and surprisingly , it seems to suppress intertwining in long protein dimers . </S>",
    "<S> supported by numerical simulations of dimer dissociation , our results provide a novel topology - based classification of protein - swapped dimers together with some preliminary evidence of its impact on their physical and biological properties . </S>"
