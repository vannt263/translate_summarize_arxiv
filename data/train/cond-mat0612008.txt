    "one - dimensional ( 1d ) quantum spin systems with an energy gap above a singlet ground state have attracted a great amount of attention both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "when the magnetic field is applied , the energy gap vanishes at the lower critical field @xmath1 due to the zeeman effect and a quantum phase transition from a gapped spin liquid to the tomonaga - luttinger liquid ( tll ) takes place @xcite . for some typical 1d gapped spin systems ,",
    "it was verified theoretically that the critical exponent of the spin correlation function in @xmath2 shows characteristic field dependence in each model @xcite with @xmath3 being the upper critical field corresponding to the saturation of the magnetization .",
    "furthermore , it was argued that such characteristic field dependence of the critical exponent can be detected by nmr measurements in the tll regime @xcite . when temperature is decreased in the tll regime , the nmr relaxation rate @xmath0 shows divergence behavior and its exponent is described as a function of the critical exponent of the spin correlation function .",
    "when the nmr measurement is performed on the nuclei located at the sites different from the electronic spins , relaxation occurs through a dipolar interaction between the nuclear and electron spins . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 is expressed as a sum of the longitudinal and transverse relaxation processes in magnetic fields .",
    "the divergence of @xmath0 with decreasing temperature is caused by one of these relaxation processes @xcite .",
    "stimulated by these theoretical studies , nmr relaxation rates in @xmath2 were measured in the haldane - gap compound @xmath4 @xcite , the @xmath5 bond - alternating spin - chain compound pentafluorophenyl nitronyl nitroxide ( @xmath6 ) @xcite , and the @xmath7 bond - alternating spin - chain compound ni(c@xmath8h@xmath9n@xmath10)(no@xmath11)clo@xmath10 @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the increase of @xmath0 in the gapless regime was observed with decreasing temperature .",
    "however , the field dependence of the divergence exponent derived from the experiments is still controversial . to develop precise evaluation ,",
    "it is indispensable to clarify the field and temperature dependences of factors other than the divergence ones in the expression of @xmath0 .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the nmr relaxation rate of quantum spin chains in the tll state . in sec .",
