    "[ [ section ] ]    godement resolutions have been an essential tool in sheaf homotopy theory and its applications almost from the start @xcite and keep cropping up in different contexts : see for instance @xcite for abelian sheaves on a grothendieck site , @xcite for sheaves of spectra on a grothendieck site , @xcite for sheaves of ( filtered ) dg commutative algebras over topological spaces , @xcite for simplicial sheaves on a grothendieck site , @xcite for sheaves of @xmath0-modules over schemes , or @xcite and @xcite for sheaves of dg - categories over schemes ... , to name but a few .",
    "in particular , the great flexibility of the _ cosimplicial _ godement resolution , together with its excellent functorial properties , appear to account for its omnipresence : in fact , in order to define it for a sheaf @xmath1 on a grothendieck site with enough points @xmath2 and values in some category of coefficients @xmath3 , we only need @xmath3 to have filtered colimits and arbitrary products . in this situation , we obtain a functor @xmath4 from sheaves on @xmath2 with values in @xmath3 to cosimplicial ones .",
    "the question we address in this paper is the following : under which conditions for the grothendieck site @xmath2 and the category of coefficients @xmath3 is the cosimplicial godement resolution useful for doing sheaf homotopy theory ? more particularly : for which @xmath2 and @xmath3 can it be used in order to define sheaf cohomology ?    [ [ section-1 ] ]    let us elaborate a little further .",
    "first of all , we want to reassemble `` all the cosimplicial pieces @xmath5 in order to obtain a simple sheaf which might be entitled to be a model '' for @xmath6 . for this",
    ", we assume that our category @xmath3 comes equipped with a simple `` functor @xmath7 .",
    "to get anchorage for her ideas , the reader may think of @xmath3 as being the category of cochain complexes of abelian groups @xmath8 and @xmath9 the total complex of a double complex .",
    "this simple functor naturally induces one on sheaves @xmath10 which comes together with a universal map @xmath11 .",
    "this is our candidate for a model '' of @xmath6 .",
    "following thomason and mitchell ( @xcite , @xcite ) , we call it the _ hypercohomology sheaf of _ @xmath6 :    @xmath12    so we can rephrase our problem more precisely as : under which conditions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 , does ( [ hypercohomologysheaf ] ) deserve to be called a fibrant \" model for @xmath6 ? for instance , assume that @xmath2 has a final object @xmath13 : when would it make sense to define sheaf cohomology of @xmath2 with coefficients in @xmath6 as @xmath14 ?",
    "more precisely , we are asking when this formula would define a right derived functor in the sense of quillen @xcite ; that is , a left kan extension .",
    "[ [ section-2 ] ]    in order to talk about derived functors and homotopy categories , we need to specify the class of morphisms with respect to which we localize . in all the examples we are aware of",
    ", this is the class that keeps track of the topology of @xmath2 , the one of _ local equivalences _ : we have a distinguished class of morphisms @xmath15 , or equivalences \" , in the category of coefficients @xmath3 ; and , for a morphism of sheaves @xmath16 to be called a local equivalence , we require every morphism induced on stalks @xmath17 to be in @xmath15 for all the points @xmath18 in @xmath2 . let us note this class of local equivalences as @xmath19 .",
    "for instance , for @xmath20 we could take @xmath15 to be the class of _ quasi - isomorphisms _",
    ", @xmath21 , morphisms which induce isomorphisms in cohomology , and then @xmath19 would be the class of sheaf morphisms inducing @xmath21 stalkwise .",
    "[ [ section-3 ] ]    it would be tempting now to try to answer our question by introducing a quillen model structure on @xmath22 in such a way that @xmath19 would be its class of weak equivalences and the hypercohomology sheaves @xmath23 a ( quillen ) fibrant model for each sheaf @xmath6 .",
    "but quillen model structures might be too much of a good thing in our case : in addition to dealing with our prime objects of interest , sheaves @xmath23 being fibrant models for every sheaf @xmath6 , we would also have to prove the existence of a cofibrant model for every sheaf , an otherwise pointless exercise .",
    "we therefore choose to keep only the minimum amount of structure in @xmath22 necessary to have the class @xmath19 as weak equivalences `` and the sheaves @xmath23 as fibrant '' models .",
    "one such minimal structure is attained with _ cartan - eilenberg structures _",
    ", ce - structures , or ce - categories , for short : an approach to homotopical algebra started in @xcite and further developed in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a ( right ) ce - structure in a category @xmath24 consists of two classes of distinguished morphisms , _ strong _ and _ weak _ equivalences , @xmath25 , and a _ ce - fibrant _ model for each object ( see [ defcecategory ] for the precise definition ) .",
    "the name of these structures comes from the classic book @xcite , where , in modern parlance , the homotopy theory of the category of cochain complexes @xmath8 is developed around two classes of distinguished morphisms : homotopy equivalences ( @xmath26 ) and @xmath21 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "but ce - structures allow more freedom of choice for classes @xmath26 and @xmath19 than classical homotopy equivalences `` and weak equivalences '' .",
    "this is particularly interesting for our categories of sheaves , for which the natural choices are :    * _ global _ equivalences , as @xmath26 : those morphisms of sheaves such that @xmath27 belongs to the class of equivalences @xmath15 in @xmath3 for every object ( open set ) @xmath28 , and * _ local _ equivalences , as @xmath19 : already mentioned above .",
    "finally , it turns out that , in order to provide our categories of sheaves @xmath22 with a ce - structure , we need very few elements in our category of coefficients @xmath3 : essentially , our needs come down to a class of equivalences @xmath15 and a simple functor @xmath29 . @xmath15 and @xmath9 are encapsulated in the notion of _ descent category _ ( see @xcite , @xcite and the second section in this paper ; cf . also @xcite ) .    [ [ section-4 ] ]    we can now state our answer to the question addressed .",
    "our main result ( theorem [ cartaneilenbergsheaves ] ) is the following :    let @xmath2 be a grothendieck site and @xmath30 a descent category satisfying the hypotheses _ ( [ hipotesis])_. then , the following statements are equivalent :    1 .",
    "@xmath31 is a right cartan - eilenberg category and for every sheaf @xmath32 , @xmath33 is a ce - fibrant model .",
    "2 .   for every sheaf @xmath32",
    ", @xmath33 is in @xmath19 .",
    "3 .   the simple functor commutes weakly with stalks .",
    "4 .   for every sheaf @xmath32",
    ", @xmath34 satisfies thomason s descent ; that is , @xmath35 is in @xmath26 .",
    "we have already proven before that sheaves @xmath34 are always ce - fibrant ( see proposition ( 4.2.5 ) ) .",
    "so this theorem shows , first , that the existence of a ce - structure on the category of sheaves @xmath22 boils down to the certainty that for every sheaf @xmath6 the universal arrow @xmath36 is a local equivalence ( condition @xmath37 ) .",
    "hence , we need nothing else in our ce - structure to answer our problem .",
    "the theorem also shows that the fact of the godement resolution being a ce - fibrant model is equivalent to thomason s classic descent ( for sheaves of spectra @xcite , condition @xmath38 ; see also corollary [ thomasondescentproperty ] ) .",
    "so being ce - fibrant is quite a natural and central notion for sheaves .",
    "finally , the theorem gives a down - to - earth equivalent condition for all this to happen , which will be the one we will use in practice : condition @xmath39 says that the simple functor @xmath9 must commute with stalks up to local equivalence .",
    "that is , for every point @xmath40 , the natural morphism @xmath41 must be in @xmath15 .",
    "for instance , for bounded cochains complexes this is a consequence of the commutation of the total complex functor @xmath42 with filtered colimits .",
    "[ [ section-5 ] ]    once the equivalent conditions of theorem [ cartaneilenbergsheaves ] for the existence of a ce - structure on a category of sheaves are established , we can obtain some conclusions almost for free :    1 .   the general criterion for deriving functors for ce - categories ( proposition [ existenciaderivado ] ) can be rephrased immediately for our categories of sheaves and gives the derivability of the global sections functor trivially ( corollaries [ existenciaderivadoimagenesdirectas ] and [ existenciaderivadosecciones ] ) .",
    "we show that , even in the absence of an associated sheaf functor for @xmath3 , the hypercohomology sheaf can be thought of as a homotopical \" sheafification functor , and the homotopy theories of sheaves and presheaves can be seen as equivalent ( corollary [ hacesiprehaceslomismoson ] ) .",
    "the category of sheaves possesses well - behaved fiber sequences and homotopy limits ( section 4.3.5 ) .",
    "[ [ section-6 ] ]    in section 5 we check when the conditions of our theorem [ cartaneilenbergsheaves ] are satisfied in some important specific examples .",
    "some are well - known : bounded complexes , unbounded complexes , fibrant simplicial sets and fibrant spectra .",
    "others , such as filtered complexes , are not so run - of - the - mill .    in a forthcoming sequel to this paper",
    ", we will point out that the godement cosimplicial resolution is a monoidal one , hence perfectly well - suited to tackle with multiplicative structures : those of sheaves of operads , operad algebras and filtered algebras , for instance , to which we will extend the results of the present paper .",
    "this paper develops an idea suggested to us by vicente navarro .",
    "we owe him a debt of gratitude for sharing it with us .",
    "the second named author also benefited from many fruitful conversations with pere pascual .",
    "we are indebted to francisco guilln , fernando muro , luis narvez and abd roig for their comments .",
