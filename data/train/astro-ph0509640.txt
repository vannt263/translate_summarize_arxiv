    "the promise of @xmath10-ray bursts ( grbs ) as cosmic lighthouses to rival quasars is being fulfilled in the areas of grb - dlas , as tracers of star - formation , and as early warning of sne .",
    "central to this promise is the belief that grbs from early in the universe can be detected ( @xmath11 , e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "but while the highest redshifts of agn and galaxies increased , for 5 years the highest grb redshift was @xmath12 .",
    "now , a grb at @xmath13 has finally been detected : grb050904 at @xmath14 ( @xcite @xcite , see also @xcite @xcite , @xcite @xcite , and @xcite @xcite ) . to date , x - ray observations of @xmath8 agn with _ chandra _ and xmm-_newton _ have obtained bare detections @xcite , and from the most luminous , spectra with a few hundred counts using long exposures @xcite , allowing contraints to be placed on agn evolution up to the edge of reionisation . in this _",
    "letter _ we examine the x - ray spectra and lightcurve of grb050904 from _ swift_-xrt .",
    "uncertainties quoted are at the 90% confidence level unless otherwise stated . a cosmology where @xmath15kms@xmath5mpc@xmath5 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 is assumed throughout .",
    "grb050904 triggered _ swift_-bat at 01:51:44ut .",
    "the bat and xrt data were obtained from the archive and reduced in a standard way using the most recent calibration files .",
    "the bat spectrum is well - fit with a single power - law with photon index @xmath18 and 15150kev fluence = @xmath19erg@xmath4 , consistent with early results @xcite that also suggested a duration @xmath20s .",
    "an upper limit to the peak energy of the burst , @xmath21kev was found by fitting a cut - off power - law model to the spectrum and deriving the 3@xmath22 limit on the cut - off energy .",
    "swift_-xrt rapidly localised a bright source @xcite and began observations in windowed timing ( wt ) mode at @xmath23s after the trigger and photon counting ( pc ) mode at @xmath24s .",
    "the xrt lightcurve ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] )    fades by @xmath25 over the first day .",
    "but the lightcurve does not decay as a power - law as in many afterglows @xcite .",
    "instead , the afterglow flares at @xmath26s , doubling the flux .",
    "this flaring is similar to that observed in other grbs at early times @xcite , but the lightcurve does not settle into a power - law decay , continuing to be dominated by large variability ( up to a factor of ten ) .",
    "the wt lightcurve is poorly fit by a power - law plus a single gaussian emission peak ( @xmath27/dof = 195.7/78 ) . allowing a second peak improves the fit ( but is still poor , @xmath27/dof = 125.7/75 ) , giving central times of @xmath28 and @xmath29s . dividing the data into hard ( 210kev ) and soft bands ( 0.52.0kev )",
    "it is clear that the later peak is harder , and the earlier peak softer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hardness ] ) .    a two - peak fit to",
    "the soft band is acceptable ( @xmath27/dof = 41.6/34 ) and gives different peak times than the fit to the full band .",
    "there is considerable scatter around this model when fit to the hard band data , giving an unacceptable @xmath27/dof ( 93.5/34 ) , which suggests greater variability in the hard band on timescales of @xmath30s .",
    "the spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spectra ] )    .spectral evolution of grb050904 [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     can be fit by a hard power - law with galactic absorption .",
    "the spectrum softens appreciably during the observation , reaching @xmath31 in the 1050ks after the grb ( table  [ tab : spectra ] ) .",
    "there is no evidence for discrete emission or absorption features .",
    "( 6.97kev ) and ( 8.10kev ) at @xmath32 have respective restframe equivalent widths @xmath33 and @xmath34ev in the wt spectra and @xmath35 and @xmath36ev in the pc spectra .",
    "there is some evidence of absorption above the galactic level : the best fit gives @xmath37@xmath4 .",
    "this excess ( @xmath38@xmath4 ) is statistically required ( significant at a level @xmath39 using the @xmath40-test ) .",
    "typical variations in the hydrogen column density at scales @xmath41 at high galactic latitudes are too small to explain this excess . without discrete features ,",
    "the redshift of the absorption is essentially unconstrained . because of the high redshift of the grb , to observe even a modest column at @xmath42 requires a high column at @xmath32 ; in this case the best - fit excess column density at @xmath32 is @xmath43@xmath4 .",
    "such a high column could not be considered entirely unexpected  a column density nearly as high as this has been detected before in a grb ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "nonetheless it is intriguing at such an early time in the star - formation history of the universe , especially since the absorption is dominated primarily by oxygen and other @xmath44-chain elements .",
    "however , it should be noted that the combination of the uncertainties in the galactic column density and the current calibration uncertainty of the xrt response at low energies must render one cautious about the detection of excess absorption in this case .",
    "the bat - detected emission overlaps the start of xrt observations and has a power - law photon index close to that observed in wt mode ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is likely that we are observing part of the prompt emission with the xrt at these times given the similarity with the bat spectrum , the rapid decay , the flaring , and a spectrum that softens considerably over the first few hundred seconds in the restframe .",
    "this may not be surprising considering the restframe energy band extends to nearly @xmath46kev .",
    "the fact that we are observing higher restframe energies in this grb does not seem to contribute much to the remarkable variability of the lightcurve , since the soft band ( 0.52.0kev ) has similar overall variability ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hardness ] ) .",
    "the amplitude of these variations seems to indicate continued energy injection from the central engine at least for the first few hundred seconds .",
    "interestingly , the large variability continues as late as 45ks ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lightcurve ] ) , and the spectrum remains hard ( @xmath47 ) , suggesting that significant energy output from the central engine is likely to be continuing at these times , corresponding to @xmath48s in the restframe . while continued energy injection at observed times of up to a few hours has been indicated since the launch of _ swift _",
    "@xcite , energy injection from the remnant at times of more than half a day was proposed to explain the late - appearing x - ray line emission in grb030227 @xcite .",
    "the maximum heights of the later variations in grb050904 also seem to decay exponentially , indicating that if accretion onto the remnant is responsible for these variations , that the accretion rate is decaying in the same way .",
    "a power spectral density analysis of the lightcurve shows no significant periodicity independent of the period of the data gaps in the range @xmath49hz . the large flaring amplitude and lack of a periodic signal is reminiscent of typical prompt phase emission from grbs .",
    "however , the total duration of the flaring ( @xmath50ks ) and the individual rise times ( a few thousand seconds ) are much longer .",
    "the overall decay envelope observed here is not typical of prompt emission either , although there are a few cases where such an overall decay is seen ( batse triggers 678 , 2891 , 2993 , 2994 , 7766 ) and it has been speculated that these continuous decays of the prompt emission result from spin - down of a black hole by magnetic field torques .      assuming an upper limit to the redshift of grb formation of @xmath51 @xcite , the likely maximum age of the grb progenitor is @xmath52myr , consistent with a massive star progenitor @xcite . at this early time in the universe , the question arises whether grb050904 could have a different progenitor than grbs at lower redshift ; for instance , a star formed in pristine gas may be one of the massive populationiii stars .    assuming the relation between total energy ( @xmath53 ) and @xmath54 @xcite , the high restframe @xmath54 ( @xmath55kev ) implies a very high @xmath53 ( @xmath56erg , consistent with a possible jet - break in the near - infrared , * ? ? ?",
    "this high @xmath53 and the large isotropic equivalent energy suggests that grb050904 was intrinsically highly energetic .",
    "the persistence of the flaring in the x - ray lightcurve , is also different from typical grb x - ray afterglows after a few hours @xcite . both the high intrinsic energy output and the large amplitude , long duration flaring are notable differences between grb050904 and typical grbs , and might hint at an unusual progenitor . on the other hand",
    ", the x - ray flux of the afterglow at 10 hours , @xmath57erg@xmath4s@xmath5 , implies a k - corrected equivalent isotropic luminosity of @xmath58ergs@xmath5 , well within the typical range @xcite .",
    "although if the beaming correction is relatively small , as suggested by the high value of @xmath59 , the energy inferred for the x - ray afterglow would also be large .",
    "access to the edge of the reionisation epoch using grbs has begun with the observation of grb050904 at @xmath0 .",
    "optical studies of the intervening matter at early times have used quasars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but may be affected by the quasar s significant influence on its surroundings .",
    "grbs are therefore potent tools in this study at optical wavelengths . with x - rays , the warm intergalactic medium ( igm )",
    "can be probed .",
    "such work has also just begun to bear fruit with very bright , nearby sources ( e.g.  @xcite @xcite , see also , @xcite @xcite and @xcite @xcite ) .",
    "this is because millions of x - ray photons are required to make these absorption line measurements reliably @xcite .",
    "the blazar mkn421 ( @xmath60 ) has a bright , intrinsically featureless continuum which provides an easily - modelled spectrum against which to detect intervening absorption features .",
    "long exposures ( @xmath61ks ) with the gratings on _ chandra _ provided @xmath62 photons from this source , mostly when the blazar was in extremely bright flaring states .",
    "this allowed @xcite to detect absorption from ionised c , n , o , and ne from igm filaments at @xmath63 and @xmath64",
    ". the spectra of grbs , in prompt or afterglow emission , are usually dominated by a featureless power - law ( although see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , as observed in this case , which makes them ideal for studies of intervening matter in a way analogous to blazars @xcite .    the rapid response of _ swift _ to grb050904 yielded high signal - to - noise ratio x - ray spectra in spite of the relatively modest aperture of the xrt",
    "this contrasts favourably with observations with _",
    "chandra _ and",
    "xmm-_newton _ of agn at redshifts @xmath8 that have so far yielded many fewer counts , even in aggregate , in a total exposure time of 300ks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , _ excluding _ the deep field observations and in spite of the far larger collecting areas of both instruments .",
    "the @xmath3erg@xmath4s@xmath5 x - ray continuum detected in the first minutes after grb050904 , demonstrates the power of grbs to probe the universe in x - rays to the highest redshifts .",
    "follow - up observations of grbs with xmm-_newton _ , and _",
    "chandra _ , have shown that in practice the typical fluxes for observations made more than @xmath65 hours after the burst @xcite are too low to detect the ionised igm ( c.f . * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "for instance , grb020813 , with one of the highest average fluxes , provided about 5000 counts in the _ chandra _ gratings over 100ks @xcite ; out of more than thirty observations over the past five years , the average observed fluxes are @xmath66erg@xmath4s@xmath5 .",
    "it is now clear that observations of grb afterglows with instruments not possessing a very rapid response can not provide grating spectra with anywhere near 100000 counts , as had been speculated @xcite .",
    "it is also now clear that a good detection of the igm requires a flux high enough to provide in excess of @xmath67 counts at moderate spectral resolution",
    ". it would be feasible to obtain enough photons in 50100ks with the narrow field instruments on the proposed _ xeus _",
    "mission , if it began observing up to about 6 hours after the burst ; with the brighter bursts this might also be possible with _ constellation - x_. but this is clearly not the most efficient way to study the igm with grbs . it was suggested as an alternative , that a high resolution instrument with small effective area could make rapid observations of grb afterglows in their early phases @xcite . to exploit the huge fluence provided by the high state and flares in the first few minutes after the grb",
    ", a small area detector could routinely provide 10000 counts , but this is insufficient for igm studies @xcite .",
    "a very rapid response , similar to _ swift _ s , to a grb like grb050904 with a large area detector with good spectral resolution and fast readout times ( e.g._constellation - x _ or _ xeus _ ) would reliably yield several to tens of millions of photons in an exposure of only a few minutes .",
    "such short observations would allow studies of the high - redshift universe along many different sightlines ; observations that would each require months of _ effective _ exposure time observing a high-@xmath9 agn .",
    "such rapid observations are demanding , but this is a technique now demonstrated in practice by _ swift _ , and the short observations would be highly efficient as well as providing superb spectra .",
    "a sample of such observations could allow us to fix the fraction of baryonic dark matter , determine the metallicity and density evolution of the igm , and put strong constraints on structure formation at high redshifts .",
    "the dark cosmology centre is funded by the dnrf .",
    "we acknowledge benefits from collaboration within the eu fp5 research training network , ` gamma - ray bursts : an enigma and a tool ' .",
    "we are indebted to s.  larsson for the power spectral density analysis .",
    "after submission of this _ letter _ , a paper by @xcite , appeared on the arxiv preprints servers ( astro - ph/0509737 ) based on the analysis of the xrt and bat data from grb050904 .",
    "their findings are similar to those reported here ."
