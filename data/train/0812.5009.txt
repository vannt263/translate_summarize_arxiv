    "entanglement is an essential ingredient in the broad field of quantum information theory .",
    "it is the basis of a lot of quantum protocols , such as quantum computation [ 1 ] , quantum cryptography [ 2 ] , quantum teleportation [ 3 ] , quantum dense coding [ 4 ] and so on .",
    "it has been an important physical resource .",
    "recently , many efforts have been made on the quantification of the resource [ 5,6,7,8 ] , however , the good understanding is only limited in low - dimensional systems .",
    "the quantification of entanglement for higher dimensional systems and multipartite quantum systems remains to be an open question .    since the remarkable concurrence was presented [ 5 ] , it has been shown to be a useful entanglement measure for the systems of qubit .",
    "more interestingly , based on the concurrence , valerie coffman et al [ 9 ] introduced the so called residual entanglement for tripartite systems of qubits .",
    "the residual entanglement is independent on the permutation of the qubits , hence can be employed to measure genuine three - party entanglement , i.e. the tripartite entanglement , which opens the path to studying multipartite entanglement . based on the motivation of generalizing the definition of the residual entanglement to higher dimensional systems and multipartite quantum systems , alexander wong et al [ 10 ] introduced the definition of the @xmath0-tangle for @xmath0 qubits with @xmath0 even , however , the @xmath0-tangle itself is not a measure of the @xmath0-partite entanglement .",
    "later , hyperdeterminant in ref .",
    "[ 11 ] has been shown to be an entanglement monotone and represent the genuine multipartite entanglement . however , it is easy to find that the hyperdeterminant for higher dimensional systems and multipartite system can not be explicitly given conveniently .",
    "in particular , so far the hyperdeterminant as an entanglement measure has not been able to be extended to mixed systems .",
    "furthermore , a new method by constructing @xmath1-qubit entanglement monotones was introduced by andreas osterloh et al [ 12 ] for pure states to measure the @xmath0-partite entanglement , however , it is only confined to the systems of qubits and seems to be very difficult to extend to the case of mixed states analogously to ref . [ 11 ] .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a new approach to generalize the residual entanglement for tripartite systems of qubits to the tripartite systems in higher dimension .",
    "one knows that the key to obtaining the explicit @xmath2 in ref . [ 9 ] is the analytic expression of the concurrence in mixed systems of qubits .",
    "however , so far no one has been able to obtain an analytic expression of concurrence ( or concurrence vector ) for higher dimensional mixed systems , which means that the expectable results for higher dimensional systems seems not to be obtained from the similar method to that in ref .",
    "hence , we provide an intuitive mathematical formulation to generalize the residual entanglement according to the tensor treatment of tripartite pure states presented in ref .",
    ". a distinct characteristic of the present generalization is that the formulation for higher dimensional systems is invariant under permutation of the subsystems ( i.e. the qudits ) , hence can be employed as a criterion to test existence of the genuine tripartite entanglement ( also called tripartite entanglement for convenience in the paper ) .",
    "furthermore , the formulation for pure states can be conveniently extended to the case of mixed states by utilizing the kronecker product approximate technique [ 14,15 ] .",
    "however , it should be noted that the formulation is not an entanglement measure except that for tripartite systems of qubits due to the variance under local unitary operations . as applications ,",
    "we give the analytic approximation of the criterion for weakly mixed tripartite quantum states ( quasi pure states ) and consider the existence of tripartite entanglement of some quasi pure states , which shows that our criterion can be conveniently applied in these cases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "firstly , we give the intuitive generalization of the residual entanglement for pure states ; secondly , we extend it to mixed states and discuss the existence of tripartite entanglement of some quasi pure states ; the conclusions are drawn in the end .",
    "the residual entanglement for tripartite systems of qubits or @xmath2 ( i.e. the tripartite entanglement measure ) is given by    @xmath3    where a constant factor is neglected and the element @xmath4 of the @xmath5 matrix @xmath6 is defined by @xmath7with the sum being over all the repeated indices , @xmath8 and @xmath9 ; @xmath10@xmath11@xmath12what s more , the @xmath13 terms in above equations are the coefficients in the standard basis defined by @xmath14 . as mentioned in ref . [ 9 ] , the expression of @xmath15 can be mentally pictured by imagining the eight coefficients @xmath16 attached to the corners of a cube .",
    "the picture yields that @xmath17 is invariant under permutations of the qubits , because a permutation of qubits corresponds to a reflection or rotation of the cube .",
    "it happens that the picture is consistent to the tensor cube introduced in ref .",
    "[ 13 ] . in other words",
    ", a tensor cube of @xmath18 corresponds to a tripartite entanglement measure @xmath19 . for convenience ,",
    "we employ @xmath20 to measure tripartite entanglement , which is equivalent to @xmath15 from the viewpoint of entanglement measure .",
    "obviously , @xmath21 has the same properties to @xmath22 .",
    "according to ref . [",
    "13 ] , a tripartite pure state in any dimension can be regarded as the tensor grid which includes tensor cubes .",
    "e.g. let @xmath23 , the tensor grid of @xmath24 can be pictured as figure 1 , which includes three tensor cubes . in this sense , one can draw a conclusion that tensor cube is the unit of tensor grid .",
    "since every tensor cube in a tensor grid can be considered as an non - normalized tripartite pure state of qubits , one can get that every unit corresponds to the tripartite entanglement measure of the non - normalized pure state .",
    "namely , the tensor cube corresponds to the minimal unit of describing the tripartite entanglement .",
    "therefore , whether there exist some genuine tripartite entanglement can be determined by all the minimal units .",
    "dimension.,width=359 ]    * * theorem 1:-**for any a tripartite pure state @xmath25 which includes @xmath26 minimal units mentioned above , let the the non - normalized tripartite pure state of qubits corresponding to the @xmath27th unit be denoted by @xmath28 , then the corresponding tripartite entanglement can be given by @xmath29 .",
    "define @xmath30{\\sum_{i=1}^{m}f\\left ( \\left\\vert \\varphi _ { i}\\right\\rangle \\right ) } , \\]]for the state @xmath31 , then if there does not exist genuine tripartite entanglement in @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",

    "it is obvious that @xmath33 means that @xmath34 holds for all @xmath35 , _",
    "vice versa_. since the tensor cube corresponds to the minimal unit of describing the tripartite entanglement , @xmath32 shows that there does not exist genuine three - party entanglement in @xmath31 .",
    "that is to say , @xmath36 can effectively test the existence of tripartite entanglement in @xmath31 .",
    "furthermore , a permutation of qudits corresponds to a reflection or rotation of the tensor grid , which is similar to that in ref . [ 9 ] , hence all the tensor cubes in the tensor grid are invariant except the relative positions in the grid .",

    "@xmath36 can be expressed as the function of @xmath31 , i.e.@xmath30{\\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{n_{1}}\\sum_{\\beta = 1}^{n_{2}}\\sum_{\\gamma = 1}^{n_{3}}f\\left ( \\left ( s_{\\alpha } \\otimes s_{\\beta } \\otimes s_{\\gamma } \\right ) \\left\\vert \\psi \\right\\rangle \\right ) } , \\]]where @xmath38 with @xmath39 ; @xmath40 , @xmath41 denotes @xmath42 matrix with @xmath43 corresponding to @xmath44 .",
