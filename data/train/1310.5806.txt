    "<S> an efficient and accurate tool is offered to assess the controllability of large sparse and dense networks . </S>",
    "<S> the exact - controllability framework enables a comprehensive understanding of the impact of network properties on controllability , a fundamental problem towards our ultimate control of complex systems .    </S>",
    "<S> one of the most challenging problems in modern network science and engineering is controlling complex networks . </S>",
    "<S> while great effort has been devoted to understanding the interplay between complex networks and dynamical processes taking place on them @xcite in various natural and technological systems @xcite , the control of complex dynamical networks remains to be an outstanding problem . </S>",
    "<S> generally , because of the ubiquity of nonlinearity in nature , one must consider the control of complex networked systems with nonlinear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> however , at present there is no general framework to address this problem because of the extremely complicated interplay between network topology and nonlinear dynamical processes , despite the development of nonlinear control @xcite in certain particular situations such as consensus  @xcite , communication  @xcite , traffic  @xcite and device networks  @xcite . to ultimately develop a framework to control complex and nonlinear networks , </S>",
    "<S> a necessary and fundamental step is to investigate the controllability of complex networks with linear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> there exist well developed theoretical frameworks of controllability for linear dynamical systems in the traditional field of engineering control @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , significant challenges arise when applying the traditional controllability framework to complex networks  @xcite due to the difficulty to determine the minimum number of controllers . </S>",
    "<S> a ground - breaking recent contribution was made by liu et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite who developed a minimum input theory to efficiently characterize the structural controllability of directed networks , allowing a minimum set of driver nodes to be identified to achieve full control . in particular , the structural controllability of a directed network can be mapped into the problem of maximum matching  @xcite , where external control is necessary for every unmatched node . </S>",
    "<S> the structural - controllability framework also allows several basic issues to be addressed , such as linear edge dynamics  @xcite , lower and upper bounds of energy required for control  @xcite , control centrality  @xcite , and optimization  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although the structural - controllability theory offers a general tool to control directed networks , a universal framework for exploring the controllability of complex networks with arbitrary structures and configurations of link weights is lacking . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , the framework of structural controllability is applicable to directed networks characterized by structural matrices , in which all links are represented by independent free parameters  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this requirement may be violated if exact link weights are given , motivating us to pursue an alternative framework beyond the structural - controllability theory . for undirected networks , the symmetric characteristic of the network matrix accounts for the violation of the assumption of structural matrix , even with random weights . </S>",
    "<S> thus we continue to lack a reliable tool to measure the controllability of undirected networks . for some practical issue towards achieving actual control , such as predicting control energy with given link weights , necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure full control are the prerequisite . taken together , we need a more general and accurate framework to study the controllability of complex networks .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we develop an exact - controllability framework as an alternative to the structural - controllability framework , which offers a universal tool to treat the controllability of complex networks with arbitrary structures and link weights , including directed , undirected , weighted and unweighted networks with or without self - loops . </S>",
    "<S> structural controllability can be reproduced by our framework for structural matrix that can be ensured by assigning random weights to directed links . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , based on the popov - belevitch - hautus ( pbh ) rank condition  @xcite that is equivalent to the kalman rank condition  @xcite , we prove that the minimum number of independent driver nodes or external controllers is equal to the maximum geometric multiplicity of all eigenvalues of the network matrix . </S>",
    "<S> if the network matrix is diagonalizable , e.g. , as for undirected networks , controllability is simply determined by the maximum algebraic multiplicity of all eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the minimum number of inputs is determined by the dimension of eigenvectors for arbitrary networks and , for symmetric networks , this number is nothing but the eigenvalue degeneracy . for simple regular networks , their exact controllability can be calculated analytically . for more complicated model networks and many real - world weighted networks with distinct node - degree distributions , </S>",
    "<S> the exact controllability can be efficiently assessed by numerical computations . </S>",
    "<S> the minimum set of driver nodes can be identified by elementary transformations based on the exact - controllability framework . </S>",
    "<S> a systematic comparison study indicates that the results from our exact - controllability theory are consistent with those in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for cases where both frameworks are applicable . </S>",
    "<S> application of our framework also reveals a number of phenomena that can not be uncovered by the structural - controllability framework . </S>",
    "<S> for example , we find that for random  @xcite and small - world networks  @xcite with identical link weights , the measure of controllability is a non - monotonic function of link density with largest controllability occurring in the intermediate region . for highly sparse or dense networks , the former being ubiquitous in real - world systems , </S>",
    "<S> the exact - controllability theory can be greatly simplified , leading to an efficient computational paradigm in terms solely of the rank of matrix . + * * + * exact controllability measurement of complex networks * + a necessary step towards ultimately controlling nonlinear network systems is to fully understand the controllability of complex networks with linear dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> consider a network of @xmath0 nodes described by the following set of ordinary differential equations : @xmath1 where the vector @xmath2 stands for the states of nodes , @xmath3 denotes the coupling matrix of the system , in which @xmath4 represents the weight of a directed link from node @xmath5 to @xmath6 ( for undirected networks , @xmath7 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath8 is the vector of @xmath9 controllers : @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the @xmath12 control matrix . </S>",
    "<S> the classic kalman rank condition @xcite stipulates that system ( [ eq : linearsys ] ) can be controlled from any initial state to any final state in finite time if and only if @xmath13=n$ ] . the standard way to address </S>",
    "<S> the controllability problem is to find a suitable control matrix @xmath11 consisting of a minimum number of driver nodes so as to satisfy the kalman rank condition . </S>",
    "<S> however , a practical difficulty is that there are @xmath14 possible combinations of driver nodes . </S>",
    "<S> the notion of structural controllability was then introduced by lin @xcite and was recently adopted to directed complex networks @xcite . relying on the maximum matching algorithm , the structural - controllability framework developed by liu et al . </S>",
    "<S> enables efficiently identifying a minimum set of unmatched nodes that need to be controlled to achieve full control of the system . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the unmatched nodes are the driver nodes , the number of which determines the controllability of the network . </S>",
    "<S> the computation complexity of finding @xmath11 based on the efficient maximum matching algorithm can therefore be significantly reduced . in general , the structural - controllability theory is valid for directed networks associated with structural matrices in which all links are represented by independent free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this limitation prompts us to develop an exact - controllability framework for arbitrary network structures and link weights .    to formulate a theoretical framework of exact controllability </S>",
    "<S> , we need a new starting point . </S>",
    "<S> our theory is based on the pbh rank condition  @xcite from control theory , according to which system ( [ eq : linearsys ] ) is fully controllable if and only if @xmath15=n\\ ] ] is satisfied for any complex number @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the identity matrix of dimension @xmath0 . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : pbh_origin ] ) , full control can be ensured  @xcite . for system ( [ eq : linearsys ] ) , there are many possible control matrices @xmath11 that satisfy the controllable condition . </S>",
    "<S> the central goal is to find a set of @xmath11 corresponding to the minimum number @xmath20 of independent drivers or controllers required to control the whole network . in general , @xmath20 is defined in terms of @xmath11 as @xmath21 , as in the structural - controllability based formulation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pbh condition has been employed recently to study the controllability of leader - follower systems  @xcite and regular graphs  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we develop a general theory to calculate @xmath20 based on the pbh rank condition ( see method and supplementary note  1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it can be proven that for arbitrary network structures and link weights , say arbitrary matrix @xmath19 , the minimum number @xmath20 of controllers or drivers is determined by the maximum geometric multiplicity @xmath22 of the eigenvalue @xmath23 of @xmath19 : @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath23 @xmath26 represents the distinct eigenvalues of @xmath19 . for undirected networks with arbitrary link weights , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath20 is determined by the maximum algebraic multiplicity @xmath27 of @xmath23 : @xmath28 where @xmath27 is also the eigenvalue degeneracy of matrix @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> we need to stress that eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : geometric ] ) is rigorous and generally valid without any limitations for matrix @xmath19 and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : algebra ] ) is proven to be valid for general undirected networks with diagonalizable matrix @xmath19 .    to compute the geometric and algebraic multiplicities for large networks </S>",
    "<S> is computationally demanding . </S>",
    "<S> however , the task can be greatly simplified if the network is either sparse or dense . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , complex networks arising in real - world applications are typically sparse @xcite . for a large sparse network , </S>",
    "<S> in which the number of links scales with @xmath0 in the limit of large @xmath0  @xcite , with a small fraction of self - loops , @xmath20 is simply determined by the rank of @xmath19 : @xmath29 for a densely connected network with identical link weights @xmath30 , in which the zeros in @xmath19 scales with @xmath0 in the limit of large @xmath0 , with a small fraction of self - loops , we have @xmath31 relying on the simplified formulas ( [ eq : efficient1 ] ) and ( [ eq : efficient2 ] ) , @xmath20 can be evaluated by computing the rank of the network matrix @xmath19 or @xmath32 in an efficient manner . for undirected sparse networks , lu decomposition with computation complexity @xmath33  @xcite can yield reliable results of @xmath34 . for other types of networks , </S>",
    "<S> svd method with @xmath35  @xcite can give accurate results of @xmath34 as well as the eigenvalues of @xmath19 .    </S>",
    "<S> the measure of controllability @xmath36 , or simply controllability , of a network can be defined as the ratio of @xmath20 to the network size @xmath0 @xcite : @xmath37    * identify driver nodes * + we offer a general approach to identifying a minimum set of driver nodes that need to be controlled by relying on the pbh rank condition ( [ eq : pbh_origin ] ) . according to the exact - controllability theory , @xmath20 is determined by the maximum geometric multiplicity @xmath38 arising at the eigenvalue @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the control matrix @xmath11 to ensure full control should satisfy the condition ( [ eq : pbh_origin ] ) by substituting @xmath39 for the complex number @xmath16 , as follows : @xmath40 = n. \\label{eq : drivers}\\ ] ] the question becomes how to find the minimum set of drivers identified in @xmath11 to satisfy eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : drivers ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the rank of the matrix @xmath41 $ ] is contributed by the number of linearly - independent rows . in this regard , </S>",
    "<S> we implement elementary column transformation on the matrix @xmath42 ( or @xmath43 ) , which yields a set of linearly - dependent rows that violate the full rank condition ( [ eq : drivers ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the controllers located via @xmath11 should be imposed on the identified rows to eliminate all linear correlations to ensure condition ( [ eq : drivers ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the nodes corresponding to the linearly - dependent rows are the drivers with number @xmath44 , which is nothing but the maximum geometric multiplicity @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> note that each column in @xmath11 can at most eliminate one linear correlation , such that the minimum number of columns of @xmath11 , say , @xmath45 is the same as the number @xmath38 of drivers , regaining our exact - controllability theory .    to illustrate the method explicitly , we present three typical simple examples , as exemplified in fig </S>",
    "<S> .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : illus ] . for each graph </S>",
    "<S> , we first compute the eigenvalues @xmath18 of the matrix @xmath19 and their geometric multiplicity @xmath46 to find the eigenvalue @xmath39 corresponding to the maximum geometric multiplicity @xmath38 . the matrix @xmath43 associated with @xmath39 can then be established so as to identify linear correlations . </S>",
    "<S> we perform elementary column transformation on @xmath43 to obtain its column canonical form that reveals the linear dependence among rows . </S>",
    "<S> the rows that are linearly - dependent on other rows correspond to the driver nodes that need to be controlled to maintain full control . </S>",
    "<S> note that the configuration of drivers is not unique as it depends on the order of implementing elementary transformation and many possible choices of linearly - dependent rows . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the minimum number of drivers is fixed and determined by @xmath38 , analogous to the structural - controllability theory . </S>",
    "<S> the approach of finding drivers is rigorous , ensured by the pbh rank condition , the maximum multiplicity theory and the column canonical form associated with matrix rank . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the method is applicable to arbitrary networks , including networks described by structural matrices . </S>",
    "<S> we have tested its performance on structural matrix by assigning each link a random parameter , which shows excellent agreement with the result from the structural - controllability framework ( supplementary fig .  s1 and note  2 ) , but with different computational efficiency . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum matching algorithm with computation complexity @xmath47 ( @xmath48 denotes the number of links ) outperforms our elementary - transformation - based algorithm with @xmath49  @xcite for dealing with structural matrix .    in general </S>",

[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * * + we have developed a maximum multiplicity approach to characterize , exactly , the network controllability in terms of the minimum number of required controllers and independent driver nodes . </S>",
    "<S> our approach by transforming the network controllability problem into an eigenvalue problem , greatly facilitates analysis and offers a more complete understanding of network controllability in terms of extensive existing knowledge of network spectral properties . </S>",
    "<S> our theory is applicable to any network structures , directed or undirected , with or without link weights and self - loops . </S>",
    "<S> our exact - controllability framework can reproduce the structural controllability for directed networks associated with structural matrices . for dense or sparse networks , </S>",
    "<S> our theory can be simplified , resulting in formulas that can be used to calculate the minimum number of driver nodes in an efficient manner . </S>",
    "<S> this is particularly encouraging , as most real - world complex networks are sparse . </S>",
    "<S> we have studied a large number of real - world networks and compared the results predicted by the structural - controllability theory in cases where it is applicable .    despite the advantage of our theory in studying the controllability of complex networks , insofar as the exact weights of links are unknown , at the present the structural - controllability framework is still the best approach to evaluating controllability of directed networks . </S>",
    "<S> this is mainly due to its error - free characteristic based on the maximum matching algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our framework relies on the eigenvalues and the rank of the network matrix , the evaluation of which inevitably contains numerical errors , although such error can be controlled by high - accurate algorithms , such as the svd algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the structural - controllability approach outperforms our method in terms of the computational efficiency in identifying the minimum set of drivers . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in our method , finding driver nodes based on the elementary transformation requires time on the order of @xmath49 , whereas the structural - controllability framework requires time on the order of @xmath47 to find unmatched nodes , where @xmath48 is the total number of links . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , our exact - controllability framework can have broader scope of application . </S>",
    "<S> for example , if the weights of partial links are available , the framework will offer better measurement of the controllability by setting the weights of other unavailable links to be random parameters , namely , partial structural matrix . </S>",
    "<S> our framework is also valid for undirected networks , where the structural matrix assumption is slightly violated because of the network symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the framework is as well applicable to networks containing a number of self - loops with identical or distinct weights , which will have quite different consequences . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , exploring exact controllability is important to achieving actual control and predicting control energy , especially in man - made networks . taken together , </S>",
    "<S> our exact - controllability theory as an alternative to the structural - controllability theory offers deeper understanding of our ability to control complex networked systems . </S>",

    "<S> , there are two concepts of multiplicity  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) algebraic multiplicity @xmath27 : multiplicity of eigenvalue @xmath23 , which satisfies @xmath58 , where @xmath27 is also the eigenvalue degeneracy ; ( ii ) geometric multiplicity @xmath22 : the dimension of the eigenspace of @xmath19 associated with @xmath23 , i.e. , @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> note that geometric multiplicity is determined by the eigenvectors associated with the eigenvalues , which means that both multiplicities depend on the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> in general , we have @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> the two types of multiplicities will be used to derive our theory of exact controllability . according to the definition of @xmath22 </S>",

    "<S> ( [ eq : jordan ] ) below . </S>",
    "<S> the key to our theory lies in bridging the two multiplicities and the controllability via the pbh rank condition  @xcite .    applying the nonsingular transformation @xmath63 and @xmath64 , we can rewrite system ( [ eq : linearsys ] ) in jordan form as @xmath65 </S>",
    "<S> it can be verified that systems ( [ eq : linearsys ] ) and ( [ eq : nonsinglar ] ) have the same controllability in the sense that @xmath66 , @xmath67 with @xmath68 . </S>",

    "<S> it can be shown that the equality in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : rankb ] ) can be satisfied by specific construction of @xmath69 , indicating the necessity of establishing @xmath69 via nonsingular transformation associated with jordan blocks ( supplementary note  2 ) . in this regard , </S>",

    "<S> that is , the minimum number @xmath20 of independent driver nodes , @xmath86 , is @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> since this is equivalent to @xmath88 , according to the definition of geometric multiplicity , we have eq .  ( [ eq : geometric ] ) : @xmath89 . </S>",
    "<S> although the maximum geometric multiplicity as the lower bound of the number of controllers has been implied in linear control theory  @xcite and some literature  @xcite , we prove that the maximum multiplicity is both the necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure full control and offer a rigorous scheme to identify the minimum set of drivers , leading to the development of an exact and efficient controllability framework . if @xmath19 is diagonalizable , e.g. , for undirected networks , then we have @xmath90 for each eigenvalue and the number of independent drivers or controllers under this condition is determined by eq .  </S>",
