    "a problem of passive advection in a turbulent medium attracts considerable attention as a solvable model of turbulence .",
    "exact solutions can be found in a simplified case , when the velocity field is chosen to be a random , short - time correlated gaussian process .",
    "statistics of density , concentration , passive vectors advected by such a field were investigated by many authors ( see ,  e.  g. ,  @xcite ) , where intermittent nature of the fluctuations , non - trivial scalings of structure functions and anomalous role of the dissipation were discovered .",
    "all these features are very common in the general picture of turbulence and , therefore , the problem of passive advection can serve as a model for developing corresponding analytical tools .    in the present paper we consider passive advection ( in the lie sense ) of a second - rank covariant tensor in @xmath3-dimensional space .",
    "though our master equation for the probability density function  ( pdf ) of the tensor ( below ) is very general , we concentrate mainly on statistics of a symmetric ( metric ) tensor  @xmath4",
    ". one - point statistics of any tensor object frozen into the fluid can be related to statistics of such a tensor .",
    "we do not impose any restrictions ( such as incompressibility ) on the velocity field , and , therefore , statistics in both eulerian and lagrangian frames are studied . also , we are only interested in the `` initial stage '' of the advection , when the advected field does not reach dissipative scales .",
    "this allows us to explore the symmetries of the problem , which are broken when dissipation is included .",
    "we show that the probability - density function of the eigenvalues of the metric is governed by a @xmath3-particle hamiltonian that can be split into two non - interacting parts . its _ non - universal _",
    "part describes the motion of the center of mass ( the determinant  @xmath5 of the metric ) and can be separated from the motion relative to the center of mass , i.  e.  dynamics of the metric s eigenvalues normalized to their geometrical mean ,  @xmath6 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the latter motion is of the calogero - sutherland type , remains the same in both lagrangian and eulerian frames of reference , and therefore describes the _ universal _ properties of the advection .",
    "these properties are dictated by the symmetry of the problem .",
    "the exact integrability of the calogero - sutherland hamiltonian is known to be related to  @xmath7 symmetry : the hamiltonian can be represented as a quadratic polynomial in terms of the generators of the corresponding algebra  @xcite .",
    "the eigenfunctions of this hamiltonian are the so - called jack polynomials , which are symmetric homogeneous functions of the eigenvalues .",
    "this allows us to find exactly all moments  @xmath8 of any tensor  @xmath9 advected by the fluid .",
    "indeed , calculating any such moment reduces to averaging expressions of the type  @xmath10 , which are symmetric polynomials in terms of the metric s eigenvalues , and can therefore be expanded in jack polynomials of degree  @xmath11 .",
    "we illustrate this method by calculating exactly all moments of passively advected vectors and covectors , in particular , of the magnetic field in kinematic rgime and of the passive - scalar gradient .",
    "we also demonstrate how this approach works in the general case of a passively advected tensor of any rank .",
    "calculating the moments requires knowing the statistics of the metric  @xmath12 with special initial conditions ,  @xmath13 .",
    "however , it is also interesting to consider the evolution of the  pdf of the symmetric tensor  @xmath4 subject to arbitrary initial conditions . in this context",
    ", we show that a beautiful dual picture exists : the time - dependent  pdf of the tensor becomes asymptotically ( @xmath0 ) invariant under the inversion of the eigenvalues with respect to their geometrical mean .",
    "for example , in three dimensions , that means that if a magnetic field advected by ideally conducting fluid develops flux tubes , it must develop magnetic sheets with the same probability .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in",
    ", we derive the master equation for the  pdf of the metric s eigenvalues , and analyze the symmetry properties of this  pdf . in , we present a simple method of transforming the  pdf between eulerian and lagrangian frames , which is important in the case of a compressible velocity field . discusses general properties of solutions for the  pdf in two- and three - dimensional cases . in",
    ", we show how the symmetry of the problem allows to calculate all the moments of passively advected tensors .",
    "the paper is written in a self - contained manner , all the necessary definitions and derivations are summarized in the appendices .",

    "@xmath20 can vary between  @xmath22 for the incompressible flow and  @xmath23 for the fully compressible flow . in order to determine the statistics of the tensor , we follow a standard procedure  @xcite and introduce the characteristic function of  @xmath24 : z(t , ) = ^ij_ij(t , ) .",
    "this function is a fourier transform of the  pdf of the matrix elements  @xmath25 .",
    "clearly , @xmath26 is independent of  @xmath27 due to spacial homogeneity .",
    "we find that  @xmath26 satisfies z & = & -@xmath28^ijz^ij + 2a^ij^ij^mnz^mn + & + & 12@xmath29 @xmath30z , where  @xmath3 is the dimensionality of space .",
    "this equation was derived by taking the time derivative of  @xmath26 , using , and splitting gaussian averages .",

    "[ pdf ]    the original equation ( [ dynamic_g ] ) preserves symmetry properties of the tensor  @xmath25 , which means that we may restrict our consideration either to advection of symmetric or antisymmetric tensors .",
    "both reductions can be done in a similar fashion . for our present purposes",
    "we only consider fluctuations of a symmetric covariant tensor .",
    "the corresponding results for a contravariant tensor are summarized in  .",
    "we will use both ( co- and contravariant ) pictures when discussing statistics of passive vectors in .",
    "in the symmetric case , the pdf   can be factorized as follows : p ( ) = p(g ) _ m <",
    "n(_mn-_nm ) , where  @xmath12 is the symmetric part of  @xmath31 . one may think of the tensor  @xmath12 as of a metric associated with the medium .",
    "due to spacial isotropy , @xmath32  depends only on the eigenvalues @xmath33 of @xmath12 .",
    "after rather cumbersome but essentially simple calculations , we establish the following master equation for the pdf of the eigenvalues of the  metric : p & = & 2(2a+1)_i_i^2 ^ 2 p_i^2 + 2a_ij_i_j^2 p_i_j + & + & @xmath34_i_ip_i + & & + ( a+1)_ij_i_j_i-_j @xmath35 + [ master_eq ] & & + 12d(d+1)(d+2)@xmath28p ( from here on the overtildes are dropped ) . among the solutions of this equation , those corresponding to the pdf must be non - negative , finite , and normalizable .",
    "the normalization is as follows @xcite : _ 1 ",
    "d_d p(_1, ",

    "clearly , the original stochastic equation   preserves the signature of the metric .",
    "we will restrict ourselves to the case of all positive  @xmath36 s .",
    "since there is no means of distinguishing between different orderings of the eigenvalues , the  pdf must be a symmetric function with respect to all permutations of  @xmath33 .",
    "we should now notice that in logarithmic variables @xmath37 , the master equation   describes the dynamics of @xmath3  pair - wise interacting particles on the line .",
    "furthermore , we can consider these dynamics in the reference frame associated with the center of mass of the particles  @xmath38 . denoting the coordinates of the particles in this frame  @xmath39 , and noticing that  @xmath40",

    "an additional symmetry emerges in this context :   and   remain invariant if the coordinates  @xmath55 of all particles are simultaneously _ reflected _ with respect to their center of mass .",

    "the equation for the metric - determinant pdf  @xmath61 follows from  : [ eq_s_e ] s = 2g^2 ^ 2 sg^2 + ( 2d+5)gsg + 12(d+1)(d+2)s , where we have rescaled time by the factor of @xmath62 $ ] .",

    "the density satisfies the continuity equation , which can be written in logarithmic  form : [ dynamic_rho ] + ^k_k+ ^k_,k = 0 .",
    "since the time increments of  @xmath68 are independent identically distributed random variables , the central limit theorem implies the normal distribution of  @xmath69 .",
    "indeed , either from   or directly from  , one can easily establish that the density  pdf @xmath70 satisfies @xmath71 .",
