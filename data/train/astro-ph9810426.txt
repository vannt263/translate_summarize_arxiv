    "the population of quasars as a whole exhibits a characteristic cosmological evolution : the number density of quasars rises monotonically by two orders of magnitude from redshift @xmath6 to an apparent peak at @xmath7 .",
    "the evolution at redshifts exceeding @xmath8 is still unclear : the number density of optically bright quasars declines from @xmath7 to @xmath9 ( pei 1995 ) , but recent rosat data have not shown any evidence for a similar decline in x  rays ( miyaji et al .",
    "1998 ) . the accreting supermassive black hole model ( first proposed by salpeter ( 1964 ) and zeldovich ( 1964 ) ;",
    "see also rees 1984 ) produces the bolometric luminosity of an individual quasar , and provides a framework that has successfully accounted for several properties of the quasar phenomenology ( e.g. blandford 1992 ) .",
    "however , the reason behind the evolution of the quasar luminosity function must involve some additional physics , likely related to the cosmological growth of structures ( efstathiou & rees 1988 )    several ideas have been put forward to explain quasar evolution , including activation by mergers ( carlberg 1990 ) ; intermittent accretion ( small & blandford 1992 ) ; association with dark halos using a nonlinear ( haehnelt & rees 1993 ) or linear ( haiman & loeb 1998 ) scaling of the bh mass @xmath10 with halo mass @xmath11 ; a relation to the individual quasar light curves ( siemiginowska & elvis 1997 ) or spectral shapes ( caditz et al .",
    "1991 ) ; and a transition to adafs at low redshift ( yi 1996 ) .",
    "more recently , cavaliere & vittorini ( 1998 ) have attributed the evolution to the initial assembly of the host galaxies ( @xmath12 ) , followed by their intermittent interactions as members of groups ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "all these ideas are still poorly constrained by present data , and a conclusive understanding has not yet been achieved .",
    "quasars are virtually absent from the local universe , but the presence of supermassive black holes ( `` dead quasars '' ) in inactive galaxies is expected as a result of past quasar activity ( e.g. lynden  bell 1969 ; soltan 1982 ; rees 1990 ) . in recent years , significant progress has been made in the detection of such supermassive black holes ( see kormendy & richstone 1995 for a review ) , and the latest results suggest that the nuclei of most , if not all , nearby galaxies contain massive dark objects , presumably the remnants of quasars ( magorrian et al .",
    "fabian & canizares ( 1988 ) pointed out that the nuclei of nearby elliptical galaxies appear much too dim to contain accreting supermassive black holes given the estimated mass accretion rates .",
    "fabian & rees ( 1995 ) suggested that this could be due to accretion via a radiatively inefficient `` ion torus '' ( similar to an adaf for that matter ; see ichimaru 1977 ; rees et al . 1982 ; narayan & yi 1994 ; abramowicz et al .",
    "1995 ; or narayan et al .",
    "1998 for a review ) which exist only at sub - eddington accretion rates .",
    "this idea was later strengthened by calculations of mahadevan ( 1997 ) , and by the relative success of several adaf spectral models of specific low luminosity nuclei ( e.g. lasota et al .",
    "1996 ; reynolds et al . 1996 ; di matteo et al .",
    "1996 ; see also di matteo et al .",
    "1999 ) .    the main ingredients in modeling the quasar lf is the bh formation rate and the light  curve of each bh in the relevant wavelength band .",
    "the usual approach is to specify these ingredients with several parameters , and fit the lf by a `` trial and error '' procedure .",
    "we emphasize here that the least understood ingredient in these attempts is the mass accretion rate onto quasar black holes . indeed , the key to understanding the cosmic evolution of quasars probably lies in their accretion history . in this paper",
    ", we invert the problem , and infer the accretion rates of quasars directly from the observed lf , while using a set of reasonable ( although not unique ) assumptions for the other model ingredients . under these assumptions",
    ", we infer an accretion rate for the quasar population , which generally decreases as a function of time . by construction , using the inferred accretion rate as an ansatz then yields a fit to the evolution of the quasar lf .",
    "we find that this fit is a viable alternative to the models proposed so far , which assume an arbitrary ( often constant ) accretion rate , and propose a redshift dependence for other model parameters .",
    "an attractive feature of the class of models proposed here is that the decline of accretion rates over cosmic time  scales could provide a natural explanation for both the disappearance of bright quasars in the local universe and the presence of faint , accreting supermassive black holes at the center of most nearby galaxies .",
    "although we focus on optical and x - ray data , the method to infer @xmath2 described here is applicable to any wavelength at which a lf and a reliable emission model exist . in this paper",
    "we adopt the concordance cosmology of ostriker & steinhardt ( 1995 ) , i.e.  a flat @xmath14cdm model with a slightly tilted power spectrum ( @xmath15)=(0.35 , 0.65 , 0.04 , 0.65 , 0.87 , 0.96 ) .",
    "we have verified that our conclusions below regarding the decline in the accretion rate do not change significantly in other ( e.g. open cdm ) cosmologies .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in   2 ,",
    "we state our assumptions on the masses of bhs ; in   3 , we discuss the procedure to relate each quasar luminosity to its host halo s mass ; and in   4 , we summarize the main features of the disk emission model used . in   5 , we derive the accretion rate as a function of redshift and halo mass , which is the main result of this paper . in   6 , we argue that a declining accretion rate is expected in cosmological structure formation models . in   7 , we address the question of an intrinsic scatter around the mean ratio of bh to halo mass , and argue that such a scatter would not significantly change our conclusions . in   8 , we briefly discuss the implication of the x  ray luminosity function .",
    "finally , in   9 we discuss the implications of this work , and in ",
    "10 we summarize our main conclusions .",
    "although there is no a  priori theory for the cosmic black hole formation rate , it is natural to expect that it is related to the formation of dark matter halos .",
    "although the fueling of the central bh takes place a the inner few parsecs of the halo , both the central gas density and temperature , likely to be the parameters controlling the fueling rate , are strongly correlated with the depth of the initial dark matter potential well , and therefore with the halo mass . the tight correlation discovered between bulge mass and black hole mass in nearby galaxies ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) provides empirical evidence that two very different scales ( i.e. the inner few parsecs for the fueling , and the @xmath16kpc sized bulge ) are connected to each other . the mass function of halos @xmath17 at any redshift is described by the press ",
    "schechter ( 1974 ) theory with an accuracy of @xmath18 when compared to numerical simulations at the mass  scales relevant here ( somerville et al .",
    "note that the shape of the halo mass function has the desirable property of a steep decline with @xmath11 , similar to the quasar lf .",
    "it has been a tradition in qso evolution studies to phenomenologically characterize the lf evolution either as pure luminosity evolution ( ple ) or as pure number density evolution ( pde ) . a distinction between these two possibilities was not feasible with the early data on the lf , which was consistent with a simple power ",
    "law , lacking any features .",
    "more recent data ( see e.g. pei 1995 and references therein ) have revealed a break ( or `` knee '' ) in the lf . although the redshift - evolution can still be adequately characterized as ple or pde in the intermediate redshift range ( @xmath19 ; see hatziminaoglou et al .",
    "1998 ) , it appears that over the extended interval of @xmath20 the evolution of the lf requires a more complex description ( caditz & petrosian 1990 ; pei 1995 ; goldschmidt & miller 1997 ; miyaji et al .",
    "associating bhs with dark matter halos in the press ",
    "schechter theory naturally gives rise to a mixture of luminosity and number density evolutions .",
    "recent measurements of the black hole masses in 36 nearby galaxies provided evidence for a linear relation @xmath21 between black hole and bulge mass ( magorrian et al .",
    "assuming @xmath22 , this result further implies @xmath23 . a simple scenario in which the latter relation is satisfied in the local universe is",
    "if the relation holds at every redshift , i.e. if the bh masses grow synchronously with the host halo masses , @xmath24 .",
    "note that if mergers are important ( i.e. if they occur on a time  scale less than the hubble time ) , then we must also suppose that black holes merge together whenever their halos do . in what follows , we assume that @xmath25 , consistent with the value @xmath26 measured by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) if all the baryonic mass is contained in the bulges of galaxy - size halos ( see  7 for a discussion of the effect of an intrinsic scatter in the ratio @xmath27 ) .",
    "we emphasize here that the correlation was observed by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in nearby galaxies , and therefore there is no observational justification for our simplifying assumption that the same correlation is already present as an `` initial condition '' at high redshifts .",
    "a possibility that can not be ruled out is that this correlation is established during the complex evolutionary histories of the individual black holes .",
    "this scenario would require significantly more complicated modeling ; however , the general feature of the models proposed here , namely a gradually declining fueling rate , would likely remain valid .",
    "in particular , to avoid a declining accretion rate , the ratio @xmath28 would have to be @xmath162 orders of magnitude higher at high redshift ( @xmath29 ) than at @xmath30 , which would imply that essentially all of the gas inside high-@xmath31 halos was already incorporated into their central bhs .",
    "the quasar lf between redshifts @xmath32 has been measured in the optical ; we use the fitting functions for the k  corrected rest  frame b  band ( around @xmath33hz ) lf obtained by pei ( 1995 ) .",
    "more recently , the lf has also been measured in x  rays ( 0.52 kev ) ; we use the parametric fits constructed by miyaji et al .",
    "both the optical and x  ray lfs have a steep slope , and the abundance of quasars rises rapidly from @xmath6 to @xmath34 . at redshifts exceeding @xmath8 , the abundance of optically bright quasars turns over and slowly declines , while the x  ray data reveal a lf that stays flat up to @xmath9 .",
    "the observed lf , @xmath35 can be compared directly with the press ",
    "schechter halo mass function @xmath17 to derive the luminosity @xmath36 of each halo of mass @xmath37 that satisfies @xmath38    here @xmath39 is the quasar `` duty cycle '' , i.e. the fraction of bhs ( assuming all halos contain bhs , see magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) that are active at a given time around redshift @xmath31 .",
    "this fraction is determined by the details of quasar light ",
    "curves and the distribution of formation times of bhs , and could be a function of several parameters , such as redshift , halo mass , etc .",
    "here we simply assume that each quasar shines for a constant time @xmath40 , and we take the duty cycle to be @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the redshift  dependent hubble time .",
    "our assumption is justified if the light ",
    "curve typically drops sharply a time @xmath43 after the quasar becomes active ( e.g. due to exhaustion of fuel , or shut  off due to a merger ) , or if intermittent activity adds up to a total duration @xmath43 ( e.g. if fueling is due to discrete clumps of gas ) .",
    "note that @xmath39 must be @xmath44 to avoid unrealistically large masses of the quasar host halos , independently of the ratio @xmath45 .",
    "the b  band luminosity @xmath46 associated with halo mass @xmath37 at redshift @xmath31 obtained by integrating equation ( 1 ) is shown in figure  [ fig : lm ] for @xmath47 and 4 , and duty cycles corresponding to @xmath48 yrs . for a reasonable range of @xmath43 , observed quasars",

    "note that this conclusion is based only on equating the observed and predicted space densities ; the only assumption in figure  [ fig : lm ] ( apart from adopting the press  schechter theory and the cosmological parameters ) is the constancy of the quasar lifetime .",
    "the general trend suggested by figure  [ fig : lm ] is that , as time goes on , observed quasars are less and less luminous , but correspond to more and more massive halos .",
    "the optical / uv `` big blue bump '' feature in the spectra of quasars is often interpreted as thermal emission from a thin accretion disk around a supermassive black hole ( e.g. malkan 1983 ; laor 1990 ; see also collin - souffrin 1994 and antonucci 1999 for possible difficulties with this interpretation ) . here",
    ", we assume that , at any redshift , ( i ) the quasar luminosity in the b  band originates from a steady thin disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; frank et al .",
    "1992 ) around a non  rotating bh , ( ii ) the disk is inclined at @xmath50 from the line of sight and ( iii ) general relativistic effects , irradiation effects and possible complications due to radiation - pressure dominated zones in the disk can be neglected .",
    "figure  [ fig : disk ] shows the luminosities @xmath51 predicted by these disk models .",
    "the lines show @xmath51 for various accretion rates ( @xmath52 to @xmath53 with @xmath54 intervals , where @xmath55 ) as a function of the central bh mass @xmath56 .",
    "note that here and in the remainder of this paper , we use the eddington accretion rate @xmath57 corresponding to a @xmath58 radiative efficiency .",
    "the essential feature of the disk emission used in our work is that there is a unique @xmath51 predicted in the b ",
    "band for a given @xmath56 and @xmath59 , as seen from figure  [ fig : disk ] .",
    "the reduction of @xmath51 at high @xmath56 and low @xmath59 in this figure appears because for this range of parameters the disk emission peaks at wavelengths longer than the b  band ( see also caditz et al . 1991 ) .",
    "this characteristic feature of the spectrum affects our conclusions for the accretion rates only for the most massive bhs at low redshifts , where the accretion rate is found to be substantially sub  eddington .",
    "if this effect was omitted from our calculations , the accretion rate for a given quasar luminosity at low redshifts would be smaller than the values inferred in   5 .",
    "we are therefore conservative in including this effect .",
    "the accretion rate in quasars as a function of redshift and bh mass can be found by equating the observed and predicted luminosities , @xmath60 . here @xmath61 is the b band luminosity associated with a halo of mass @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "1 ) , which harbors a black hole of mass @xmath62 ; @xmath51 is the b  band luminosity of the quasar as shown in figure  [ fig : disk ] . as an example , according to figure  [ fig : lm ] if the source lifetime is @xmath63 yr , at @xmath64 a halo of mass @xmath65 ( with a black hole of mass @xmath66 ) has a luminosity of @xmath67 .",
    "this luminosity and black hole mass , according to figure  [ fig : disk ] , correspond to an accretion rate @xmath68 ( third curve from top ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot ] , we show the inferred accretion rate @xmath59 as a function of redshift for three different duty cycles ( @xmath69 yr ) . in each case , we show the accretion rates for the halo mass range @xmath70 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot ] reveals that in all cases , the accretion rate decreases with decreasing redshift , and that between @xmath71 , it drops by a factor of several hundred",
    ".    the inferred accretion rates are roughly independent of halo mass for @xmath63 yr , as reflected by the grouping of the solid lines in figure  [ fig : mdot ] .",
    "this grouping is partly due to the combined effect of the non  linear dependence of @xmath61 on m@xmath72 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lm ] ) , and the turnover in the luminosity at high bh masses and low accretion rates ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disk ] ) . for a longer lifetime",
    ", @xmath59 increases with increasing halo mass ( long dashed lines ) ; while for a shorter lifetime @xmath59 decreases with increasing halo mass ( short dashed lines ) .",
    "note that in the latter case @xmath73 is predicted , meaning that the required luminosities can be produced only by bhs larger than we assumed ; this would be inconsistent with the observational results of magorrian et al .",
    "although figure  [ fig : mdot ] shows results only from the optical lf , we obtain qualitatively similar curves from the x  ray data , if we assume an x  ray / optical flux ratio of @xmath74 .",
    "this value is based on the mean spectrum of a sample of 48 quasars , selected by elvis et al .",
    "( 1994 ) by the requirement that each quasar has a good spectrum both in the optical ( from _ iue _ ) and x - ray ( from _ einstein _ ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath59 , independent of @xmath11 for @xmath63 yr , suggests that the accretion rate in physical units goes as @xmath75 at any given time .",
    "such a scaling would hold , for example , if each halo was undergoing isolated spherical self - similar infall ( bertschinger 1985 ) .",
    "the apparent turnover of @xmath59 at redshifts @xmath12 reflects the decline of the b  band lf at these redshifts , and may be caused by dust obscuration ( heisler & ostriker 1988 ) .",
    "this explanation is consistent with the recent x  ray data ( insensitive to the presence or absence of dust ) showing that the x - ray lf does not decline at @xmath12 ( see   8 for a more detailed comparison between x - ray and optical data ) .",
    "is a declining accretion rate in the population of quasars expected ?",
    "a derivation of the accretion rate from first principles must necessarily address several complicated issues that are beyond the scope of this paper , such as the role of angular momentum and gas cooling .",
    "such studies are now underway , e.g. sellwood & moore ( 1999 ) have explored in detail the formation of massive central objects in bars of galactic disks , and their subsequent fueling , including the dependence on angular momentum . here",
    "we will only put forward two general arguments for a decline of the accretion rate with decreasing redshift .",
    "first , assuming that each black hole grows as a central point mass in an isolated collapsing spherical cloud , the self  similar infall solutions of bertschinger ( 1985 ) imply=1 models . ] that @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "although isolated spherical infall is likely to be a crude approximation at best for the formation of quasar black holes , the primary reason for the slow growth of the central mass is the cosmological expansion .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that departure from spherical symmetry , or interactions with other collapsing halos could considerably speed up the accretion , relative to the power ",
    "law growth for an extended period of time ( corresponding to @xmath78 ) in the entire quasar population . in figure",
    "[ fig : mdot2 ] we show the ( declining ) accretion rate as a function of redshift based on the bertschinger ( 1985 ) solutions .",
    "a second argument can be drawn directly from the press  schechter theory . in the limit",
    "that @xmath79 merely reflects the growth in mass of each individual halo , the accretion rate of halos can be obtained by requiring that the total number density of halos does not change , @xmath80 = 0 $ ] .",
    "this yields for the halo mass accretion rate @xmath81^{-1},\\ ] ] which , by our assumption of constant ratio @xmath28 , is identical to the bh accretion rate . in figure  [ fig : mdot2 ] we show the accretion rates in this limit as a function of redshift .",
    "the accretion rates drop in all cases , but unlike in the isolated spherical self - similar infall case , @xmath82 depends on the halo mass .",
    "note that both the bertschinger solution and press  schechter theory predict mass accretion rates which are super  eddington at high @xmath31 , and become substantially sub  eddington near @xmath83 .",
    "an important ingredient ignored in the above argument is the occurrence of mergers between halos . naively taking a time  derivative of the mass ",
    "function @xmath17 results in a quantity that is negative for small masses , and positive for large masses , with the sign changing at a critical value @xmath84 .",
    "sasaki ( 1994 ) argued that this behavior reflects a decreasing contribution of destructive mergers to the evolution of the mass function for halos of mass @xmath85 .",
    "in other words , the evolution of the mass function at large masses ( the typical halo mass @xmath11 of interest here ) would be governed mainly by accretion , rather than mergers .    in order to quantify the role of mergers ,",
    "we have used the extended press ",
    "schechter formalism ( lacey & cole 1993 , equation 2.18 ) to compute merger rates between halos of various masses . in figure",
    "[ fig : merge ] we show the number of major mergers that a halo of a given mass @xmath86 experiences in a hubble time .",
    "we have defined a major merger to occur when the mass ratio of the merging halos is less than 0.5 ( i.e. a halo collides with another halo whose mass is between @xmath87 and @xmath88 ) .",
    "the figure reveals that the merger rate between galaxy ",
    "sized halos @xmath89 has the desirable property of having a well  defined peak around @xmath90 , the redshift at which the lf of bright quasars peaks .",
    "however , the figure also shows that the decrease in the physical merger rate @xmath91 between @xmath92 and @xmath93 is only a factor of @xmath94 ( taking into account a factor of @xmath95 increase in the hubble time during this interval ) . if the fueling rate of bhs were proportional to the merger rate ( corresponding to a fixed fraction of the baryons going into the hole for each merger ) , this decrease would be insufficient to explain the evolution of the observed quasar lf : our results show that the decrease in @xmath59 has to be over two orders of magnitude . note that our definition of a `` major merger '' , and therefore the resulting merger rate , is somewhat arbitrary .",
    "however , we find that including a wider range of halo masses in defining the merger rate still leads to an insufficiently small decrease in @xmath59 .",
    "we conclude that the decrease in the merger rates between halos might play an important role in reducing the accretion rates , and contribute to the cosmological evolution of the quasar lf .",
    "however , we find that if the fueling rate of quasars is proportional to the halo merger rate , then the rapid evolution between @xmath92 and @xmath93 of the quasar lf requires an additional decrease by about an order of magnitude in the fueling rate .",
    "we have so far assumed a deterministic linear relation between the quasar luminosity @xmath96 , halo mass @xmath11 and black hole mass @xmath10 .",
    "more realistically , one would expect that individual quasars exhibit an intrinsic scatter around the mean ratio @xmath28 . in the sample of 36 galaxies analyzed by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the value of @xmath97 is found to obey the probability distribution @xmath98 $ ] with @xmath99 and @xmath100 .",
    "the implications of this result for the scatter in the ratio @xmath101 is not clear , because of our ignorance of @xmath102 for the observed galaxies .",
    "van der marel ( 1999 ) finds statistical errors in the observationally determined bh masses ( due to photometry , psf deconvolution , and uncertainties about stellar contributions to the central density profile ) that could explain all of the observed scatter .",
    "however , some unknown fraction of the observed scatter @xmath103 is likely to be real , and we investigate below the effect of this scatter on the inferred accretion rates .    in the presence of an intrinsic scatter ,",
    "the bh mass function is given by the convolution @xmath104 .",
    "at large halo masses , where the halo mass function is a steeply declining function of @xmath11 , this convolution increases the expected space density of bhs of a given mass . to quantify the effect that this increase has on the models",
    ", we assume the `` log  normal '' probability distribution given above , with @xmath105 and @xmath106 for the ratio @xmath107 .",
    "this is equivalent to the extreme assumption that _ all _ of the observed scatter is intrinsic ; the real situation is likely to be in between the deterministic linear relation (   5 ) and the case of strong intrinsic scatter presented here .",
    "figure  [ fig : lmscat ] shows the _ mean _ relation between quasar luminosity and halo mass in the presence of scatter , derived analogously to figure  [ fig : lm ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdotscat ] shows the resulting accretion rates , analogously to figure  [ fig : mdot ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : lmscat ] and  [ fig : mdotscat ] are very similar to figures  [ fig : lm ] and  [ fig : mdot ] , respectively .",
    "in particular , a decline of @xmath59 of approximatively 2 orders of magnitude is still inferred between @xmath108 . since , in first approximation",
    ", a given b - band luminosity is @xmath109 for thin disk emission ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mdot ] ) , a strong intrinsic scatter of @xmath110 for log @xmath10 corresponds to a scatter @xmath111 for log @xmath112 .",
    "therefore , at the @xmath113 level , an uncertainty of a factor @xmath114 exists on the inferred @xmath59 shown in figure  [ fig : mdotscat ] . even with this large uncertainty , the decline of the accretion rate from high redshift to low redshift is still statistically significant .",
    "we emphasize again here that this amount of scatter in @xmath59 corresponds to the extreme case where all the observed scatter in the relation between @xmath10 and @xmath115 is assumed to be intrinsic to the ratio @xmath28 .",
    "a simultaneous study of the quasar evolution in x  ray and in optical ought to reveal important information on accretion processes in these objects .",
    "a detailed treatment of this question , which would necessarily involve an x  ray emission model , is beyond the scope of the present paper . in general",
    ", the ratio of optical to x  ray emission of quasars could be a complicated function of @xmath10 , @xmath59 and @xmath31 .",

    ", recent rosat observations resolved the bulk of the x  ray background into discrete sources ( hasinger 1999 ) , and have shown that the characteristic hard spectrum of the xrb can only be explained if most qso spectra are heavily absorbed .",

    "1999 ) .    for simplicity ,",
    "here we consider only the following , simplified question .",
    "we assume that the accretion rate previously derived from the optical lf is an accurate estimate of @xmath82 , and we expect the same accretion rate to power x  ray emission from quasars .",
    "therefore , we ask : what is the ratio of optical to x  ray emission ( as a function of @xmath10 and @xmath31 ) required to obtain consistency between the accretion rate derived from the optical and the x  ray luminosity functions .    in figure",
    "[ fig : opticalvsx ] , the accretion rate derived from optical data , assuming a strong scattering of @xmath106 in the @xmath117 of the ratio @xmath27 , with a mean of @xmath118 and @xmath119  yr , is shown as dashed lines for various @xmath10 ( equivalent to the solid lines of fig .",

    "( 1998 ) is simply flat , with no redshift evolution .",
    "therefore , although the results shown in figure  [ fig : opticalvsx ] reveal a more complicated ( although still significantly declining ) accretion rate at @xmath123 , these results should be considered more uncertain , until the x  ray lf is measured more accurately .",
    "the environments of quasars can certainly be affected by cosmological structure formation and evolution , which could lead to a redshift - evolution of the x  ray / optical ratio . in this case",
    ", the departure from equation  [ eq : ratio ] at high-@xmath31 could indeed be significant .",
    "the above considerations reveal that the relation between the x  ray and the optical emission of quasars , and its evolution , are not trivial .",
    "it suggests that the energy radiated in x ",
    "rays is @xmath125 % of the energy in the b - band for a bh of mass @xmath126 , and higher for smaller bhs ( with approximate equality between optical and x  ray emission for @xmath127 ) .",
    "the reason for the dependence on @xmath10 is unclear .",
    "if one believes that at low enough @xmath59 ( say @xmath128 ) , the accretion flow in quasars is made of an inner adaf and an outer thin disk , then the increase of @xmath129 for smaller @xmath10 could be due , at least in part , to an increase of the transition radius @xmath130 between the adaf and the disk , which would result in a reduced optical emission from the disk .",
    "this trend seems consistent with the rather large values of @xmath130 in x  ray binaries containing stellar - mass bhs ( e.g. narayan , barret & mcclintock 1997 ) and the smaller value in , for example , the agn ngc 4258 ( gammie , narayan & blandford 1999 ) .",
    "however , the problem is complicated by the fact that the value of @xmath130 also depends on @xmath59 ( see e.g. narayan et al .",
    "1998 for a discussion ) .",
    "the argument based on @xmath130 is only qualitative and tentative , and it certainly does not capture all the physics of the problem .",
    "we note , for example , that at high @xmath31 and nearly eddington accretion rates , one can not invoke optically thin adafs to produce the large amount of x  ray emission observed . at smaller redshifts , the good agreement we find between the @xmath112 inferred from optical and x - ray data ( using eq .",
    "[ eq : ratio ] ) implicitly assumes the proportionality @xmath131 .",
    "if the quasar s emission were due to an adaf alone , then the x  ray luminosity would scale approximately as @xmath132 , rather than as @xmath59 ( e.g. narayan et al . 1999 ) .",
    "internal consistency of a two - component adaf + thin disk model therefore requires a dependence of @xmath130 on @xmath82 such that the linear scaling @xmath131 we assume is recovered .",
    "while this is plausible , a more detailed theoretical treatment of these models is necessary to clarify whether adafs indeed play a role in the evolution of the optical vs. x  ray lfs .",
    "in the class of models presented here , black holes grow synchronously with their dark matter halos after their formation , maintaining a constant ratio @xmath28 .",
    "we did not address the important question of consistency between the mass accretion rates inferred from the lfs and the individual black hole masses acquired by the end of the quasar phase ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "this would require following the accretion and the merger history of individual halos ( lacey & cole 1993 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ) while our work concentrated on the quasar population as a whole .",
    "related to this question is the interpretation of the duty  cycle , which could be caused either by short intermittent activity phases or one single luminous phase .",
    "we assumed that all halos have a central black hole , as suggested by observations ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) ; however the duty cycle could be partly interpreted as a fraction of the halos harboring quasars .",
    "it is important to note that , independent of the questions of interpretation above , our fit to the lf with a declining @xmath82 is not unique .",
    "an alternative possibility is a decrease of the average quasar lifetime with redshift .",
    "a continuously shortening lifetime would decrease the duty cycle , and this would go in the right direction towards explaining the decline in the qso abundance at @xmath13 .",
    "figure  [ fig : mdot ] shows that keeping the accretion rate constant ( @xmath134 ) over the range @xmath135 would , however , require very short lifetimes near @xmath136 . in order to quantify the role",
    "@xmath43 might play in the evolution of the lf , we have repeated our calculations , keeping the accretion rate @xmath59 fixed , and allowing @xmath40 to decrease with decreasing @xmath31 .",
    "we find that the lifetimes required to fit the lf near @xmath136 are implausibly short , @xmath1371 yr .",
    "this is not surprising : reducing @xmath59 allows a qso at a fixed luminosity to be associated with a more massive , and thus an exponentially rarer dark halo . in comparison ,",
    "a reduction in the duty  cycle decreases the abundance only linearly with @xmath43 .",
    "a second alternative is an accretion rate kept constant at the eddington value , while the ratio @xmath28 decreases rapidly towards low redshifts ( haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : mbhz ] we explicitly show the value of @xmath28 as a function of @xmath31 required in this case . in this model ,",
    "the bh formation efficiency decreases from redshift @xmath138 to @xmath139 by @xmath162 orders of magnitude .",
    "the ratio @xmath28 is also a function of @xmath11 .",
    "the form of this function depends sensitively on the assumed duty  cycle , but at @xmath93 the ratio is monotonically increasing with @xmath102 for @xmath140 years . in this model , at @xmath93 , the required bh masses are significantly smaller than considered above (   2 ) ; this is consistent with the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) data , provided bulges comprise only a small fraction of the total baryonic mass in galaxy  size halos , and the bulge mass has a non  linear dependence on the halo mass ( see haehnelt , natarajan & rees 1998 for a discussion ) .",
    "observations of nearby galaxies provide only a relation between the black hole mass and the mass of the spheroidal component of the galaxy ( magorrian et al .",
    "it is possible that a significant fraction of the baryonic mass of these galaxies ( in form of gas ) is omitted from the mass budget when @xmath10 is related to @xmath102 .",
    "indeed , attempts to observationally estimate the mass of an extended gaseous component in both spiral and elliptical galaxies have remained rather unsuccessful so far ( see zaritsky 1998 )",
    ". if this component is important for the mass budget , halos of observed galaxies are more massive than assumed above , which results in smaller values of the ( mean ) ratio @xmath101 .",
    "the effect of reducing @xmath141 by a constant factor is simply to scale up the accretion rates required to fit the quasar lf , but the decline with @xmath31 is conserved .",
    "for example , for the case with strong intrinsic scatter , we find that the effect of reducing the mean value of the ratio @xmath141 from @xmath118 to @xmath142 is to scale up @xmath82 by one to two orders of magnitude ( depending on halo mass and @xmath43 ) in comparison to the values shown in figure  [ fig : mdotscat ] .",
    "this is unacceptable in the framework of the thin accretion disk models considered here since the accretion rates at high @xmath31 become substantially super - eddington for all halo masses and @xmath143 yr .    in deriving the relations",
    "@xmath144 shown in figures  [ fig : lm ] and  [ fig : lmscat ] , only two assumptions have been made : ( 1 ) one bh in each press  schechter halo , and ( 2 ) a constant quasar lifetime . in particular , the @xmath144 relation is independent of the ratio @xmath45 , and quite large halo masses ( @xmath145 ) arise simply by equating the predicted space densities of halos with the observed space densities of optical quasars ( a similar result is obtained with the x - ray lf ) .",
    "there are two ways to avoid unreasonably large halo masses .",
    "the first option is to have a duty cycle @xmath146 yr .",
    "such a short @xmath43 could be consistent with super - eddington accretion via a `` radiation torus '' ( blandford & rees 1992 ) , but not with the eddington  limited thin disk accretion considered here .",
    "a second , perhaps more attractive , solution to the problem of large halo masses is to observe that such halos ( @xmath147 ) correspond to groups or clusters of galaxies in the press  schechter formalism .",
    "we have so far assumed that each halo harbors one bh ( as did previous works relating quasars to press  schechter halos ) .",
    "however , it is plausible that a cluster ",
    "sized halo contains several quasars , perhaps one in each of its member galaxies . including this effect would change the black hole mass function , and result in a reduction of @xmath10 and an increase of @xmath2 deduced from the observations .",
    "a detailed study of this effect requires a knowledge of the sub  structure of each halo , which is beyond the scope of the present work .",
    "although we based our models on the spectrum of a thin accretion disk , the decline in the accretion rate would be inferred with more general accretion models as well .",
    "the two essential characteristics of thin disk accretion that we utilized are ( 1 ) a radiative efficiency of roughly @xmath148 , and ( 2 ) the approximate proportionality of the flux to @xmath10 and @xmath59 . any accretion model with roughly these properties would lead to similar conclusions on the decline of the accretion rate with decreasing redshift .",
    "finally , in order to assess the sensitivity of our results to the assumed cosmology , we repeated our calculations in an open universe ( setting @xmath149 ) . the predicted space density from the press ",
    "schechter formalism is strongly dependent on cosmology .",
    "however , when we assume a different cosmology , we also correct the observationally derived luminosity function , since this quantity comes from the number of objects on the sky per solid angle .",
    "using the corrected intrinsic space density @xmath35 tends to balance the changes to the press ",
    "schechter mass function due to cosmology .",
    "we find that the accretion rates inferred in the open cdm model differ by less than @xmath150 from those shown in figure  [ fig : mdot ] in the @xmath14cdm model .",
    "we constructed models for the cosmological evolution of quasars , using the press  schechter theory for determining the black hole mass function , and assuming that quasar optical emission is due to accretion via a thin disk .",
    "contrary to existing models of quasar evolution , the accretion rate @xmath2 of the quasar population is not postulated , but rather inferred from the observed quasar luminosity function .    according to these models , the accretion rate of the population of quasar black holes decreases with cosmic time .",
    "we find that the same fueling rate is inferred from the x  ray and optical lf , provided the x  ray / optical flux ratio decreases with bh mass .",
    "more detailed modeling of the emission processes in these two bands is needed to clarify the validity of the relation we find .",
    "a peak in the accretion rate near @xmath151 ( fig .",
    "3 ) is inferred from the optical lf . a derivation using x ",
    "ray data does not show a similar turnover , suggesting that the peak inferred from the optical data is caused by dust obscuration .",
    "near @xmath83 , @xmath2 drops to substantially sub - eddington values at which adafs exist",
    ". the combination of a decreasing @xmath152 and a possible transition to radiatively inefficient adafs at late times could be the origin of the absence of bright quasars in the local universe _ and _ the faintness of accreting bhs at the centers of nearby galaxies .",
    "we argued that such a decline of the quasar accretion rate over cosmic timescale is consistent with expectations from cosmological structure formation models , and can not be explained by halo mergers alone if the fueling rate of quasars is proportional to the merger rate .",
