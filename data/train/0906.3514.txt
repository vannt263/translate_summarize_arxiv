    "the study of brown dwarfs ( bd ) is a very active field in astronomy . since the discovery of the first ones less than 15 years ago @xcite ,",
    "much has been learned on the nature of those objects .",
    "while spectacular advances in modeling their atmospheres have been made , understanding the physical properties of bds straddling the l / t transition remains one of the most challenging problems . among the unresolved issues",
    "is the intriguing increase of the @xmath1-band luminosity with decreasing temperature over the 1400 - 1100 k interval , just following the transition from l to t type .",
    "this odd behavior , the so - called @xmath1-band brightening @xcite , is surprising as one would naively expect near - infrared brightness to decrease with temperature .",
    "the brightening coincides with the disappearance of silicate grains from the brown dwarfs atmospheres and is most likely a consequence of this disappearance , but a self consistent explanation has yet to be found .",
    "while dusty models containing no grain sedimentation best reproduce the behavior of late - m to mid - l dwarfs , condensed ( clear ) models , where the grains are entirely removed from the atmospheres , accurately describe mid - to - late - t dwarfs .",
    "models including grain settling and precipitation @xcite have been able to reproduce a flattening of the @xmath1-band magnitude over the problematic temperature interval , but no single set of physical parameters can entirely reproduce the observed early - t dwarf sequence .",
    "the fundamental assumption of these models , that a single set of physical parameters can describe the photosphere of t dwarfs , might not be accurate .",
    "the problem is further complicated by the possibility that , to some extent , the @xmath1-band brightening may be caused by a high frequency of unresolved binaries over this spectral type interval @xcite .",
    "@xcite proposed a set of models with dust settling that describes the whole l and t sequence with a parameterization of the cloud deck thickness .",
    "they introduced a critical temperature , t@xmath5 , below which the dust no longer remains in the atmosphere in the form of clouds and is removed from the atmosphere through gravitational settling .",
    "they suggest that the @xmath1-band brightening may be explained by the fact that the l - t sequence is _ not _ necessarily a t@xmath6 one but that it must instead be understood as arising from variations of both t@xmath6 and t@xmath5 . aside from this possibility , it has been suggested that clearings in an otherwise cloudy atmosphere may be responsible for the observed @xmath1-band brightening @xcite .",
    "in such a scenario , where the atmosphere is not uniform , photometric variability could be observed due to the rotation and/or evolution of the cloud pattern .",
    "there have been many observational searches for variability in ultracool dwarfs ( m7 and later ) in the last few years .",
    "early searches concentrated mostly on l dwarfs in the @xmath7 band and clearly established that roughly half of these objects display variability on timescales ranging from tens of minutes to weeks , with amplitudes of a few tens of mmag @xcite .",
    "several studies suggest that variability also extends to bds at the l / t transition .",
    "@xcite reported relatively large @xmath3 variability ( @xmath8 mmag with uncertainties of @xmath9 mmag ) for 3 transition objects ( l7 , t1 and t5 ) with some evidence of periodic ( @xmath10 h ) modulation .",
    "other groups @xcite have detected variability for a few objects at a level of @xmath11 mmag .",
    "recently , @xcite described a marginal detection of variability for the t2 dwarf sdss1254 using near - infrared spectroscopy .",
    "finally , @xcite tentatively detected photometric modulations ( @xmath210 mmag at @xmath12 m ) in the thermal infrared for two late - l dwarfs .",
    "overall , while variability seems to be established for l / t bds , the significance of these detections remains marginal and no clear correlation between photometric bands has been reported .",
    "the t2.5 brown dwarf ( @xcite , simp0136 hereafter ) , the second brightest known t dwarf after @xmath13 indi bab , is an ideal target for studying the intriguing physical properties of bds straddling the l / t transition .",
    "it falls in the middle of the @xmath1-band brightening and it does not appear to be a binary , down to separations of 0.2@xmath14 and @xmath15 as inferred from lick ao observations @xcite . in this paper , we report on the detection of significant near - infrared photometric variability for this object . the analysis of these observations not only provides compelling evidence for the presence of clouds at the surface of this bd but also offers an attractive explanation for the @xmath1-band brightening observed in early t dwarfs .",

    "( omm ) @xmath30  m telescope with the cpapir near - infrared camera @xcite , featuring a 0.89@xmath14 pixel scale and a @xmath31 field of view .",
    "the observations were obtained on 2008 september 16 , 18 , 19 and 21 , under photometric conditions . as the cpapir point - spread function ( psf )",
    "would be undersampled under better than 1.8@xmath14 seeing , and given that simp0136 is a relatively bright target , the camera was purposely defocused to produce @xmath32-pixel fwhm psfs .",
    "the individual exposure times were @xmath33  s with a single coadd .",
    "the data were obtained without dithering and using a guide probe . to further minimize drifts of the field during the sequence due to flexure between cpapir and the guide probe in the telescope bonnette , a script was run in real time to send slow ( @xmath2 10 minutes ) , closed - loop corrections to the guide probe .",
    "the results from the first set of observations prompted us to take consecutive @xmath1 and @xmath3-band photometric observations on the night of 2008 , december 13 .",
    "the data were also obtained at the omm but using the simon near - infrared spectro - imager with a @xmath34 pixel scale and a @xmath35 field of view .",
    "the @xmath1 and @xmath3 sequences lasted @xmath36 and @xmath37 hours respectively with individual exposure times of @xmath38  s in both bands .",
    "the observing strategy was the same as before .",
    "for all datasets , a high signal - to - noise ( > @xmath39 e@xmath40 ) dome flat was obtained at the end of the night .",
    "all datasets were reduced using the same method .",
    "first , the images were dark subtracted and divided by the median - combined dome flat",
    ". then boxes of @xmath41 pixels centered on simp0136 , on three nearby reference stars slightly brighter than simp0136 and a on comparison star closely matching the @xmath1 and @xmath3 of simp0136 ( see table  [ tbl1 ] ) .",
    "the same reference and comparison stars were used for both the cpapir and simon observations .",
    "a handful of bad pixels , none of them falling on the psfs , were present in the boxes ; they were simply interpolated .",
    "aperture photometry was performed using radii of 2.5 times the @xmath42 encircled energy radii of the psf ( typically 5 - 6 pixels ) .",
    "the sky level was estimated by using the median value of all pixels beyond 1.5 times the photometric aperture radius in each box .",
    "the above steps produced raw light curves for the target and each of the three reference stars .",
    "the raw light curves of simp0136 display a strong modulation unlike anything seen in the raw light curves of the reference or comparison stars ( figure  [ fig5 ] ) .",
    "the raw curves of simp0136 and the comparison star were then corrected for systematic effects in the following manner .",
    "the light curve of simp0136 and the comparison star ( shown in figure  [ fig1 ] ) were obtained by dividing them by the mean normalized raw light curves of the 3 reference stars , see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "we obtained between 460 and 867 individual images per night and the photometric points shown in figure  [ fig1 ] are binned over 5-minute intervals ( 11 to 14 individual measurements ) .",
    "uncertainties per individual image ranged from 14 to 19  mmag for both simp0136 and the comparison star , corresponding to a @xmath43  mmag uncertainty over a 5-minute interval for both objects .",
    "a similar analysis was done for the december 13 data and the results are shown in figure  [ fig2 ] .",
    "the photometric variability of simp0136 is clearly visible from figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the variation reached a peak - to - peak amplitude of @xmath44  mmag .",
    "the december data ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) clearly show that the @xmath1 and @xmath3 light curves are correlated with one another , the variations being more pronounced in the former with an amplitude ratio of @xmath45 .",
    "the september 21 light curve , covering 7.5 h , shows a periodic , double - peaked signal .",
    "a very similar modulation is also observed on september 19 . as a rough estimate of the period",
    "can be readily obtained from the september 21 light curve , and as there is an important second harmonic component in the data set , we determined the precise period by fitting a two - harmonic signal using a levenberg - marquardt algorithm rather than using a lomb - scargle period - search algorithm @xcite , which assumes a sinusoidal signal and is better suited for sparsely sampled datasets .",
    "we derived a @xmath46  h period using either the september 19 and 21 datasets .",
    "the evolution of the light curve of simp0136 prevents us from deriving a more accurate period as the light curve can not be folded over several nights .",
    "besides , differential rotation probably renders pointless the attempt of establishing a much more precise period .",
    "a @xmath47 h period would correspond to a @xmath48 of up to @xmath49  km / s depending on the object s rotation axis inclination with our line of sight , consistent with the fastest rotators in the @xcite and @xcite samples .",
    "only a handful of brown dwarfs have a similar rotation period .",
    "the l2 dwarf kelu-1 has a rotation period of less than 2 hours @xcite .",
    "the young m8.5 dwarf s ori 45 displays a photometric ( in the @xmath1 and @xmath7 band ) modulation with a @xmath50 hours period but this periodicity was not detected in later observations despite hints of a yet faster ( 30 - 45 minutes ) modulation @xcite .",
    "strong discrete periodograms peaks have been reported for 2m1145 at periods ranging from 2 to 3.5 hours @xcite but the light curve of this object can not unambiguously be folded to a single period .",
    "the clear evolution of the light curves from night to night in figure  [ fig3 ] could be due to time - varying clouds or storms in the atmosphere of simp0136 . in that case",
    ", observations over several days can give a time scale for the evolution of those clouds / storms .",
    "the evolution of the modulation could also be attributed to a differential rotation .",
    "if such an assumption is made , a significant phase difference between the equator and the higher latitudes has to be present within our five - day baseline ( here we assume that the december observation is entirely decorrelated ) . assuming a ( maximum ) phase difference of 180@xmath51 between the equatorial and high - latitude regions of simp0136 over the 5-day - long observing sequence would imply a @xmath52% differential rotation .",
    "this value is comparable to jupiter showing a @xmath53% differential rotation per period between its equator and high latitudes .",
    "it is thus possible that the evolution of the light curves in figure  [ fig3 ] is the result of differential rotation .",
    "this hypothesis will require a much better temporal sampling to be confirmed .",
    "the relative variations at @xmath1 and @xmath3 can be used for constraining the physical processes at play . using the @xcite and @xcite models , assuming an effective temperature of @xmath54  k , @xmath55 and solar metallicity , we derived @xmath56 for three different variability scenarios : 1 ) _ dusty _ clouds on a _ clear _ atmosphere with both phases at the same effective temperature , 2 ) inhomogeneous surface temperature , for either a _ dusty _ or a _ clear _ atmosphere and 3 ) _ dusty _ clouds on a _ clear _ atmosphere with both phases at different temperatures . here _",
    "dusty _ and _ clear _ refer to the _ settled _ and _ condensed _ models of @xcite and to the _ cloudy _ and _ clear _ models of @xcite . for scenarios 2 and 3 we further considered the models of @xcite , the case where dust clouds are completely absent from the atmosphere is presented only as a limiting case ( called _ case c _ in @xcite ) , it assumes a t@xmath57 equal to the condensation temperature of the dust grains .    for the first scenario ,",
    "both sets of models predict that , for an atmosphere of constant temperature , the @xmath1 and @xmath3 band light curves should be anti - correlated ( i.e. @xmath58<@xmath59 ) .",
    "this can easily be understood as the cloud - free models are brighter than the cloud - bearing models at @xmath1 and inversely at @xmath3 . thus if an object evolves from , say , a @xmath42 cloud - free and @xmath42 cloud - bearing atmosphere toward a @xmath60 cloud - free and @xmath61 cloud - bearing atmosphere",
    ", it will brighten in @xmath1 and dim in @xmath3 .    in the second scenario ,",
    "the variability is caused by surface temperature inhomogeneities in an entirely _ clear _ or _ dusty _ atmosphere resulting in a time - variation of the disk - averaged temperature .",
    "numerically , this is done by taking the ratio of the relative flux increases in @xmath1 and @xmath3 for a small ( i.e. @xmath62 ) temperature change :    @xmath63    using all models , we derived a @xmath56 ranging from @xmath64 to @xmath65 , the lower and upper limits being set respectively by the _",
    "cloudy _ and _ settled _ models of @xcite .",
    "the @xcite models using a t@xmath66 , yield a @xmath67 .",
    "the observed @xmath68 allows us to exclude the first two variability scenarios .",
    "we now consider the third case whereby clouds have a different temperature from the surrounding cloud - free atmosphere .",
    "let @xmath69 be the cloud filling factor and @xmath70 the variation in cloud coverage .",
    "we assume that _ clear _ ( cloud - free ) regions are at a temperature @xmath71 k , appropriate for a t2.5 dwarf , and that clouds have a temperature of @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 $ ] and @xmath74 $ ] be the fluxes in the photometric bandpass @xmath75 as a function of temperature for the _ dusty _ and _ clear _ models .",
    "the variability is caused by the variation in cloud coverage ( @xmath70 ) as the brown dwarf rotates .",
    "it can be shown that the resulting variability @xmath76 in a photometric bandpass is    @xmath77 f+f_{\\rm c}[t ] ( 1-f )   } {    f_{\\rm d}[t+\\delta t ] ( f+\\delta f)+f_{\\rm c}[t ] ( 1-f-\\delta f ) } \\right).\\ ] ]    the @xmath56 ratios for all models and different values of @xmath69 and @xmath78 are shown in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "as shown in this figure , the resulting @xmath56 varies only slightly as a function of the assumed filling factor for clouds versus cloud - free patches .",
    "also , the overall behavior between the @xcite and @xcite models is consistent . the observed @xmath45 can be reproduced by clouds between 80 to 110 k colder than the cloud - free atmosphere .",
    "the results are mildly dependent on the temperature of the _ clear _ regions ; a @xmath79=1300 k would increase the derived @xmath78 to values ranging from 125 to 150 k. this variability scenario also gives a @xmath80 ratio allowing for a direct conversion of the light curve amplitude ( @xmath81 ) into an estimate of the variation of the cloud filling factor ( @xmath70 ) . the derived @xmath80 range from 1.5 to 2.3 depending on the assumed filling factor @xmath69 ( between 0.25 and 0.75 ) .",
    "this implies that for a @xmath82 mmag variability amplitude in @xmath1 , the patches involved in simp0136 variability cover between @xmath83 and @xmath84 of the visible disk .",
    "this does not constrain the overall filling factor of the _ dusty _ versus _ clear _ regions , only time - differences .    in the @xcite models ,",
    "the _ case c _ ( equivalent to the _ clear _ models ) is not expected to cover a large fraction of the surface , we therefore examined only the case @xmath85 case where @xmath86 of the surface would be covered by the t@xmath66 model ( equivalent to the _ dusty _ models ) . the observed @xmath56 implies a @xmath87k temperature difference between the _ case c _ and cloud - bearing regions , consistent with the predictions of the @xcite and @xcite models .    beside atmospheric phenomena ,",
    "periodic modulation at a few percent level could easily be introduced by the presence of a transiting companion with a radius of 2 - 3 r@xmath88 or by grazing transits in a roughly equal - sized binary .",
    "however , the observed night - to - night evolution of the light curves strongly disfavors any explanation of the variability in terms of transits / grazing transits .",
    "the expected light curves would be very stable from period to period and evolve extremely slowly through the evolution of the orbital elements .",
    "also , any transit scenario would imply an out - of - transit flat - top light - curve that is not observed .",
    "furthermore , transit light curves show little wavelength dependence ( apart from limb darkening effects ) and one would expect a @xmath89 regardless of the geometry of the system .",
    "the observed variability of simp0136 suggests that atmosphere models attempting to describe its physical properties using a single set of parameters ( dust settling rate , temperature , gravity , etc ) are bound to be incomplete as at least two different types of regions must be present on its visible disk to produce the observed variability .",
    "the idea that early - t dwarfs could be described as objects with more than one set of physical properties and arbitrary filling factors is not new @xcite , but the detected variability and its interpretation in terms of colder clouds in a warmer atmosphere provides empirical physical constraints of these cloudy and cloud - free regions .",
    "it has been proposed previously that the @xmath1-band brightening may result mainly from a decrease in the fractional coverage of dust clouds against warmer , _ clear _ regions of the brown dwarfs atmospheres as they progress from spectral type l to t. indeed , a brightening in @xmath1 is a natural outcome of this as warmer _ clear _ regions are brighter than cooler _ dusty _ regions in @xmath1 .",
    "our observations not only bring empirical evidence for this scenario , but also provide an estimate of the temperature difference between the _ cloudy _ and _ clear _ regions of the atmosphere .",
    "the difference of @xmath2100 k suggested by our results would lead to a brightening of @xmath90 mag in @xmath1 from a completely _ cloudy _ to a completely _ clear _ atmosphere , assuming no temperature change for each respective model ; this amplitude is similar to that of the observed @xmath1-band brightening . in reality , the l / t transition is likely accompanied by a mild change in the temperature of both types of atmosphere - _ cloudy _ and _ clear _ - but the overall behavior would be similar .",
    "the exact shape of the @xmath1-band brightening could potentially be reproduced by adjusting , as a function of spectral type , both the temperature of the _ clear _ regions and the difference of temperature between the _ clear _ and _ cloudy _ patches .",
    "considering that most searches for variability in early - t dwarfs resulted in non - detections or marginal detections despite sensitivities sufficient to readily detect variability at the level observed for simp0136 , the following question naturally arises : is simp0136 an oddball object with unusual physical properties ? or is it representative of early - ts ?",
    "the non - detection of variability in other early - ts does not disprove the _ cloudy _ versus _",
    "clear _ hypothesis : cloud structure on these objects could be either too small to produce significant photometric variability or distributed in bands without longitudinal inhomogeneities .",
    "the near - infrared photometric properties of simp0136 are typical of early - t dwarfs ( see figure 2 in @xcite ) and its proper motion is consistent with that of a thin disk object ; it is therefore not expected to have unusually low metallicity and/or high surface gravity .",
    "the only slightly unusual property of simp0136 , besides its photometric variability , is its relatively rapid rotation .",
    "determining whether rapidly rotating brown dwarfs are more likely to feature larger - scale atmospheric structures would require global circulation models ; this could be verified observationnaly by a variability survey specifically targeting rapid rotators .",
    "the physical interpretation of the mechanisms at play is strongly dependent on the accuracy of current atmospheric models and their handling of dust settling ; it is nevertheless encouraging that three major sets of models give similar temperature differences and surface coverage .",
    "the variability model proposed here leads to a number of readily testable predictions that will provide a unique input for modelers .",
    "photometric variability in other bands is expected ; @xmath91 should closely match @xmath56 , while @xmath92 should be @xmath53 . obtaining",
    "an accurate measurement of the @xmath93 would be of particular interest as this ratio is strongly dependent on the temperature difference between the _ cloudy _ and _ clear _ regions , ranging from @xmath94 to @xmath95 over the @xmath96 to @xmath97  k interval .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy should reveal a number of variable spectroscopic features , especially in the far - red and @xmath1 bands .",
    "in particular , variability is expected for the depth and shape of the 0.78 @xmath98 m and @xmath1-band ki doublets , the continuum slope between 1.17 and 1.22  @xmath98 m , and the strength of the @xmath99  @xmath98 m crh and feh bands .",
