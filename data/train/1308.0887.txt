    "during the last few decades , many tensor mesons have been observed by different experiments @xcite .",
    "the investigation of these particles is one of the most interesting problems in hadron physics both theoretically and experimentally . in the literature , there are few theoretical works devoted to the analysis of the properties of the tensor mesons compared to the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector and axial - vector mesons .",
    "the study of parameters of tensor mesons and their comparison with the experimental results can give useful information on their nature and internal structure .",
    "moreover , the investigation of these particles can be useful for understanding the non - perturbative dynamics as well as the vacuum structure of qcd .",
    "the observation of charmed @xmath0 and @xmath1 states both with quantum numbers @xmath8 , were reported twenty years ago @xcite and confirmed by the lhcb collaboration in 2011 @xcite .",
    "the properties of these mesons at zero temperature have been recently studied in @xcite . in this article",
    ", we investigate the thermal properties of these particles , which can be used in analysis of the results of the heavy ion collisions held at different experiments .",
    "the study of parameters of mesons at finite temperature requires some thermal non - perturbative approaches .",
    "one of the most attractive and applicable tools in this respect is the thermal qcd sum rules firstly suggested for investigation of hadronic parameters in vacuum @xcite and later was extended to finite temperature and density @xcite .",
    "this extension was based on some basic assumptions so that the wilson expansion and the quark - hadron duality approximation remain valid , but the vacuum condensates are replaced by their thermal expectation values . at finite temperature , the lorentz invariance is broken by the choice of a preferred frame of reference and some new operators appear in the wilson expansion @xcite . to restore the lorentz invariance in thermal field theory ,",
    "the four - vector velocity of the medium is introduced . making use of this velocity and the fermionic and gluonic parts of the energy - momentum tensor , a new set of four dimensional operators",
    "are constructed .",
    "the thermal qcd sum rule method has been widely used to investigate the medium properties of the light - light @xcite , the heavy - light @xcite and the heavy - heavy @xcite systems mainly in recent years .    in the present work ,",
    "in particular , we investigate the masses and decay constants of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 tensor mesons in the framework of thermal qcd sum rules method .",
    "taking into account the additional operators coming up at finite temperature , we calculate the thermal two point correlation function and obtain the spectral densities in one loop approximation . in order to perform the numerical analysis",
    ", we use the fermionic part of the energy density obtained both from lattice qcd @xcite and chiral perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "we also use the temperature dependent continuum threshold @xcite and investigate the sensitivity of the masses and decay constants to the temperature .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we evaluate the wilson expansion for the two - point correlation function and derive the thermal qcd sum rules for the masses and decay constants of the @xmath9 and @xmath6 tensor states . in section 3",
    "we present our numerical calculations and discuss the obtained results .",
    "to calculate the masses and decay constants of the @xmath5 and @xmath6 tensor mesons in the framework of the thermal qcd sum rules , we start with the following thermal correlation function : @xmath10{\\rangle}_{|_{y=0}},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath11 is the interpolating current of the tensor mesons , @xmath12 is temperature and @xmath13 indicates the time ordering operator . as the interpolating current of the tensor mesons contains derivatives with respect to the space - time , after applying derivatives with respect to @xmath14 we will set @xmath15 .",

    ", the aforementioned thermal correlation function can be calculated in two different ways : first , in terms of qcd degrees of freedom called theoretical or qcd side , and the second , in terms of hadronic parameters called the physical or phenomenological side . the correlation function in qcd side",
    "is calculated using the operator product expansion ( ope ) , where the short and long distance effects ( see figure 1 ) are separated .",
    "the thermal qcd sum rules for the physical observables such as the masses and decay constants are obtained equating the coefficients of the same structure from both sides of the correlation function through a dispersion relation .",
    "finally , the borel transformation and continuum subtraction are performed in order to suppress the contributions of the higher states and continuum .",
    "as previously mentioned , the correlation function in qcd side is evaluated via ope in deep euclidean region where the perturbative and non - perturbative contributions are separated .",
    "the perturbative part is calculated via perturbation theory using spectral representation , while the non - perturbative contributions are represented in terms of the thermal expectation values of the quark and gluon condensates as well as thermal average of the energy density .",
