    "relatively few hadronic states are stable to strong decays ( i.e. via qcd with degenerate @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks ) . among the mesons , we have  @xcite :    [ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     some of these states ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 ) are stable ( in qcd in the isospin conserving limit ) whereas the rest have other channels open . there is a large literature , stretching over 40 years , discussing the consequences of the nearby threshold on these states .",
    "one definite implication is that isospin breaking is enhanced by mass splittings in thresholds ( eg . @xmath6 compared to @xmath7 is 8 mev higher and this induces isospin mixing between the states at 980 mev ) .",
    "this level of detail is not accessible in lattice studies at present , but lattice qcd should be able to address the issue of the influence of thresholds on these states .",
    "the observation of a state near a 2-body threshold implies that there is an attractive interaction between the two bodies .",
    "but this is a topic like that of whether the chicken or egg was created first : an attractive interaction implies and is implied by a nearby state . what can lattice qcd offer here ?",
    "we are in the position of being able to vary the quark masses and this is a very useful tool .",
    "a two - body threshold will move in general in a different way with changing quark mass than a @xmath8 state .",
    "we can also move the strange and non - strange masses separately and this can be helpful too .",
    "another line of investigation is that lattice studies can explore the wavefunction of a state - either the bethe - salpeter wavefunction or the charge or matter spatial distribution .",
    "one can also explore the coupling of a state to a 2-body channel , as was discussed above .",
    "the prototype of a molecular state is the deuteron : it has a tiny binding energy ( 2.2 mev ) and a very extended spatial wave function .",
    "pion exchange between neutron and proton gives a mechanism for this long - range attraction .",
    "in general it is difficult to reproduce such small binding energies in lattice studies .",
    "another case where a long - range pion exchange can give binding is in the @xmath9 system . here",
    "lattice results indicate  @xcite the possibility of molecular bound states in some quantum number channels which have an attractive interaction from pion exchange , but also the possibility of bound multi - quark states which are not described as hadron - hadron but where the two heavy quarks form a colour triplet and the light quarks are arranged as in a heavy - light - light baryon .",
    "this @xmath9 example illustrates the rich structure available to multi - quark systems .    one case where lattice studies have been able to shed considerable light is for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 scalar mesons .",
    "since , in the isospin conserving limit , these states can not couple to @xmath12 , @xmath13 , they have a lightest open decay channel @xmath14 , @xmath15 .",
    "lattice studies  @xcite indicate that , in both cases , the scalar meson lies below the open threshold , so the states should be stable .",
    "because simple quark model expectations were that these scalar mesons were unstable , theorists have suggested that a @xmath14 , @xmath15 molecular composition was responsible .",
    "this can be explored on a lattice by measuring the spatial distribution of the heavy - light meson .",
    "a study  @xcite of the charge distribution of the light quark in a @xmath5 meson is illustrated in fig.[fig : jk2 ] .",
    "this shows that the light quark spatial distribution is similar to that of other @xmath16 states ( eg .",
    "@xmath17 ) for which no molecular interpretation is proposed .",
    "this reinforces the conclusion that the @xmath5 is predominantly a @xmath18 state .",
    "the decay transition from @xmath5 to @xmath14 has also been determined ( see above ) and it has an effective coupling constant which is consistent with that found for other ( non - molecular ) decays .",
    "overall , lattice evidence does not support the hypothesis that @xmath5 is a molecular state .",
    "lattice can address hadronic structure :    * form factors ( eg . charge wavefunctions ) can be evaluated * decay transitions ( and mixing transitions ) can be evaluated * structure function moments can be evaluated ( steady but slow progress here ) * hadronic matrix elements are needed to interpret experiment ( eg @xmath19 relates @xmath20 meson to @xmath21 quark , etc .. ) in searches for signs of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "hadronic physics involves _",
    "unstable _ states and lattice techniques are being developed to study these as we have summarised .",
    "these techniques have been tested against experiment for @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "in particular we presented evidence that the spin exotic hybrid meson ( made of light quarks ) is at a mass around 2 gev and has a wide width .",
    "we discussed scalar mesons , and presented evidence that the @xmath24 meson is basically a @xmath25 state and that the @xmath5 meson is also predominantly a @xmath26 state ."
