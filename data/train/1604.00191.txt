    "the vertical profile of our galaxy in the solar neighbourhood ( snhd ) can be closely fitted by the sum of two exponentials with scaleheights of @xmath1 and @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "@xcite found that both thin and thick components could be characterised by exponential radial profiles , with the thick component having a larger scalelength than the thin component .",
    "many external disc galaxies also show vertical profiles that can be decomposed into thin and thick components @xcite , with the thick component having a radial scalelength that is similar to , or slightly larger than , the scalelength of its thin counterpart .",
    "in the solar cylinder the thick component contributes @xmath3 per cent of the local stellar mass surface density , and its stars tend to have larger random velocities , higher ages , lower metallicities and higher @xmath4-element abundances @xcite . in a plot of @xmath5 versus @xmath6 , two sequences can be identified : a ` normal ' or ` low-@xmath4 ' sequence , which starts around @xmath7 with a small slope , and a ` high-@xmath4 ' sequence , which is nearly flat at low @xmath6 and then bends more steeply downwards to join the low-@xmath4 sequence around @xmath8 . @xcite used data from the segue survey to argue that the vertical velocity dispersion of stars varies continuously with chemistry , and that signs of a thin / thick disc dichotomy are an artefact of selection functions .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite found well defined low and high @xmath4 abundance sequences in the @xmath9 plane of the apogee survey . while it is tempting to infer two distinct populations from a bimodality in @xmath5 , @xcite ( hereafter sb09a , b ) have shown that such a bimodality is a natural consequence of chemical evolution timescales .",
    "the high-@xmath4 sequence dominates larger altitudes in the disc , but its importance diminishes towards larger radii .",
    "this observational finding has lead to the conclusion that the @xmath4-rich component of the milky way ( mw ) has a comparably shorter scale length @xcite .",
    "this fading of the thick high-@xmath4 component seems to contradict the long photometric thick disc scale length found by @xcite and the lack of evidence of a change in the vertical profile as a function of radius both in our galaxy and in external disc galaxies @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that low @xmath4 populations flare with increasing radius and take the role of the thick component in the outer disc ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the vertical scaleheight of a stellar population in a given galactic potential is determined by its vertical velocity dispersion . if we group nearby stars by age , the velocity dispersion of the group increases with age ( @xcite ) .",
    "this phenomenon has been inferred also for external galactic discs ( @xcite for m33 , @xcite for m31 ) . however , for snhd stars this increase appears to be continuous with age and does not indicate a thin - thick bimodality @xcite .",
    "currently stars are born very close to the plane with small velocity dispersions , but over time fluctuations in the galaxy s gravitational field cause stars to diffuse from the near - circular orbits of their birth to more eccentric and inclined orbits , with the consequence that the velocity dispersion of each coeval group of stars steadily increases .",
    "it is possible that _ all _ disc stars were born on nearly circular orbits , but it is also possible that at early times the young galaxy s gravitational field fluctuated so strongly that even dense gas could not settle to circular orbits , so stars had significant random velocities at birth .",
    "a major goal of this paper is to investigate the possible genesis of thick - disc stars assuming no significant external perturbation throughout the era in which nearly all disc stars formed .",
    "fluctuations in the gravitational field that accelerate stars can arise in several ways .",
    "@xcite suggested that an important source of fluctuations is giant gas clouds .",
    "the subsequent discovery of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) with masses @xmath10 vindicated this suggestion .",
    "@xcite showed that spiral structure can be a significant source of fluctuating gravitational field , provided it has either a very high density contrast or is of transient and recurring nature .",
    "stars can also be heated by merging satellite galaxies @xcite .",
    "another key ingredient in the evolution of disc galaxies is bars . in today s universe around 70 per cent of all disc galaxies ,",
    "including the mw @xcite , have stellar bars at their centres @xcite .",
    "bars have been shown to contribute to the radial and vertical heating in disc galaxies @xcite and to provide a mechanism for the radial migration of stars @xcite .",
    "bars are believed to be a natural outcome of the evolution of dynamically cold galactic discs ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , observations of galaxies at redshifts between 0 and 1 have revealed that the fraction of bars was significantly lower several gyr ago @xcite .",
    "although it is generally believed that a combination of heating processes mentioned above can explain the thin disc age velocity dispersion relation ( avr ) , the origin of the thick disc is still heavily debated .",
    "two key questions are : 1 ) did thick - disc stars form in a thin disc which was subsequently heated , or did they form with large random velocities in a turbulent gas disc @xcite ?",
    "2 ) if they formed in a thin disc is an external perturber required to endow them with their present random velocities , or could these have arisen through internal secular processes , such as scattering off the bar @xcite and gmcs followed by radial migration @xcite of stars from the hot inner disc to the cooler outskirts ( sb09b ) ?    in this paper , we seek to understand whether double exponential vertical profiles of disc galaxies can arise purely from secular evolution , i.e. from heating by gmcs and by structures such as bars and spirals , which inevitably occur in a growing disc galaxy @xcite . as spiral heating is expected to contribute little to the vertical heating",
    "( see @xcite for a recent confirmation with modern isolated disc simulations ) our focus here is on gmcs , bars and the outward transport of hot populations through radial migration .    to study these heating processes ,",
    "usually idealised , isolated models have been used .",
    "unfortunately , the majority of these models do not at the same time include all the ingredients , which have been implicated in disc heating : growing discs with multiple coeval populations , recurring spiral structure with evolving properties , a bar , radial migration , and gmcs that at early times each contain a bigger fraction of the total disc mass than they do today .",
    "cosmological , hydrodynamical simulations of the formation of disc galaxies do , in principle , contain all these items and have recently also become capable of producing disc galaxies with realistic structural parameters and star formation histories ( e.g. @xcite ) and have also been used to study disc heating @xcite .",
    "however , the uncertainties regarding the proper modelling of hydrodynamics and ` sub - grid ' physics are still substantial ( e.g.  @xcite ) , and simulations with a resolution of @xmath11 as desired are still very costly , which prevents large sets of such models . models of idealised disc galaxies growing from the cooling of hot gas in an idealised and isolated or cosmological dark matter halo @xcite are more easily accessible for the problems considered here , but concerns regarding hydrodynamics and sub - grid models and their effect on young stellar populations in the simulations remain .",
    "for example ,",
    "@xcite discuss how birth velocity dispersion depends on resolution and the assumed star formation prescription .",
    "we therefore pursue a different , complementary approach , which allows us to study disc heating with @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "we return to the approach pioneered by @xcite , but used in only a few papers since then ( notably the study by @xcite of the emergence of exponential surface density profiles from arbitrary angular momentum distributions of infalling matter ) . in this approach particles representing stars , and possibly gas and gmcs ,",
    "are continuously added on near - circular orbits .",
    "spiral structure and bars are naturally excited in the disc , and they both accelerate the stars and cause them to migrate radially .",
    "we analyse our final models to determine how they compare with observational diagnostics of disc heating in the mw .",
    "given the need to use arbitrary prescriptions for sub - grid physics in full hydrodynamical simulations of disc growth , the models are no less rigorous than full simulations , and , since they are computationally cheaper , we can run large numbers of models and gain a reasonable understanding of how a growing disc can evolve in isolation .",
    "in this paper , we ( i ) present a set of novel numerical simulations of growing galaxies and explain how they were set up and run , and ( ii ) give an overview of the most important lessons learnt from these simulations .",
    "more detail will follow in papers on particular aspects of galactic growth , such as the age - velocity - dispersion relation for nearby stars and its connection to the underlying heating laws , the distribution function of the dark halo , the impact of spiral structure on star surveys or the details of radial migration processes .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows : section 2 defines the simulations .",
    "section 3 justifies our modelling strategy by showing insensitivity to the adopted initial conditions and adequate resolution .",
    "section 4 demonstrates the fundamental role played by gmcs , explores the more minor role played by space - filling interstellar gas , and discusses heating and radial migration within discs . a key result of this section , in which the disc mass and the structure of the dark halo are in line with conventional wisdom , is that , while thin discs very much like that of our galaxy form in many simulations , if a thick disc is required at the current epoch , it has to be added to the initial conditions .",
    "so in section 5 we explore non - standard disc masses and structures of the dark halo , and show that adopting a non - standard disc or halo , while not solving the problem of thick - disc formation , spoils the good agreement with observation found earlier as regards the bar and thin disc . in section 6",
    "we discuss the idealisations and potential missing ingredients of our models .",
    "finally , in section 7 we sum up and consider future work .",
    "we analyse a large set of controlled simulations of growing galactic discs embedded in non - growing dark matter haloes .",
    "these simulations were all carried out with the tree smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( treesph ) code gadget-3 , last described in @xcite .",
    "we apply different gravitational softening lengths @xmath12 for baryonic and dark - matter particles ( listed as @xmath13 and @xmath14 in table [ ictable ] ) and use an opening angle @xmath15degrees for the tree code .",
    "we use an adaptive time - stepping scheme in which timesteps are fractions @xmath16 of a base timestep @xmath17myr chosen by the code : the @xmath18th particle is assigned timestep @xmath19 when @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the particle s gravitational acceleration and softening length , respectively , and @xmath23 is an accuracy parameter .",
    "the hydrodynamical timestep is based on a courant - like condition @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is the courant parameter , @xmath26 is the smoothing length and @xmath27 is the sound speed .",
    "we apply an isothermal equation of state @xmath28 and use @xmath29 neighbours for the smoothing kernel . for further code details",
    "we refer to @xcite .      to generate initial conditions ( ics ) for our numerical experiments we use the publicly available galic code @xcite , which produces near - equilibrium ics of multi - component collisionless systems with given density distributions using an iterative approach .",
    "the initial systems consist of a dark halo with a mass in the range of @xmath30 represented by @xmath31 particles and an embedded baryonic component .",
    "the ics feature an initial baryonic component in the form of a disc or a bulge of mass @xmath32 represented by @xmath33 particles , so that the corresponding baryonic particle masses are in the range @xmath34 .",
    "the density of the dark halo is given by @xcite @xmath35 the inner profile is adjusted so that it is similar to an nfw profile with concentration @xmath36 and virial velocity @xmath37 .",
    "the scale radii are in the range @xmath38 .",
    "the halo initially has a spherical density profile and radially isotropic kinematics , i.e. equal velocity dispersion in the principal directions , @xmath39 and consequently the anisotropy parameter @xmath40 .",
    "our ic bulge components are set up with the same structure as those in @xcite and have a hernquist density profile with scalelength @xmath41 which is distorted to be mildly oblate with axis ratio @xmath42 as @xmath43 we choose @xmath44 , which is smaller than the @xmath45 found by @xcite in their multi - component mw models with a hernquist bulge , as we would like to test the impact of compact bulge and as the mw bulge has likely grown over time due to secular processes .",
    "the bulge initially has no net rotation and the velocity structure is axisymmetric .",
    "disc components are set up with a mass profile @xmath46 with an exponential scalelength @xmath47 and a radially constant isothermal vertical profile with scaleheights in the range @xmath48 .",
    "the vertical velocity dispersion @xmath49 thus declines with radius . for the ics which start with a thin disc with @xmath50",
    ", we assume @xmath51 , so that toomre s @xmath52 shows a minimum value of @xmath53 for our standard halo . for hotter ic discs we assume @xmath54 .    for simulations with gas components",
    "we include a thin gas disc in the ics .",
    "for the yg and fg sets of ics ( see table [ ictable ] ) , the initial gas disc is created by turning a randomly chosen 5 per cent of stellar particles in a y or f ic into sph particles .",
    "we choose a low initial gas mass so that the disturbance of the ic is mild and unimportant compared to the rapid onset of disc instability in the growing galaxy . for the eg set of ics we turn 1.66 per cent of star particles in the e ic into gas particles , so that the initial gas mass is the same as in yg and fg .",

    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ modeltable3 ]      although gmcs are composed of gas , in our models , we treat them separately from the less dense gas that occupies much of the galactic plane .",
    "to model the impact of a population of gmcs on the dynamics of the disc , we introduce a population of very massive particles . as stars form in gmcs the total mass of gmcs present",
    "is determined by the sfr and the efficiency of star formation @xmath55 , which gives the fraction of mass of a gmc that turns into stars before supernovae completely destroy the gmc . for the mw , @xcite finds @xmath56 .",
    "gmcs are short - lived , with lifetime @xmath57 : @xcite finds @xmath58 for massive gmcs in the mw and @xcite find a very similar value , @xmath59 , for inter - arm clouds in m51 .",
    "however , @xcite also remarks that to account for the total molecular mass in the mw one has to assume that molecular gas spends no more than half its time in clouds , and the rest assembling and dispersing .",
    "we translate these facts into our models by adding a mass @xmath60 in gmcs whenever we add a mass @xmath61 in stars . a gmc lives for @xmath62 .",
    "the mass of a gmc particle is a function of time : @xmath63 where @xmath64 .",
    "hence in the first half of its @xmath65 life , a cloud assembles from an initial mass @xmath66 , and then its mass is constant at @xmath67 until a burst of supernovae suddenly destroys it .",
    "@xmath68 is the total mass a coeval population of gmcs has reached after 25 myr .",
    "the typical sizes of massive gmcs in the mw are @xmath69 ( e.g.  @xcite ) , close to the gravitational softening length @xmath70 of our disc particles in our standard resolution .",
    "we therefore also model the gmc particles with @xmath71 , which is advantageous because when particles with differing softening lengths interact , the code uses the longer length .",
    "when increasing ( decreasing ) our resolution we decrease ( increase ) the softening lengths for dark matter particles , but keep @xmath72 the same .",
    "@xmath73 is only changed for increased resolution , when it is decreased .",

    "their radial distribution is the same as that of the stars added at the same time except that we impose an outer cutoff at @xmath76 .",

    ", gmcs are preferentially found in higher - density disc structures such as spiral arms and/or rings . to determine how the specific spatial distribution of gmcs influences the heating process",
    ", we do not distribute them uniformly in azimuth , as we do for star and gas particles .",

    "the youngest stars are not included because they are introduced randomly in azimuth and need time to fall in with structure in the disc , and older stars are excluded as they are hotter and display weaker azimuthal structure . if @xmath80 , gmc particles are added uniformly in azimuth , whereas if @xmath81 , any structure displayed by young stars is reinforced by added gmcs .",

    "the fact that gmcs are not needed to explain observed @xmath195 , but are required to explain @xmath194 confirms @xcite , who argued that heating by spirals and bars can explain the in - plane dispersions , but gmcs are needed to explain the vertical heating .",

    "[ fig : gasgmc ] , we conclude that gas _ does _ enhance the heating efficiency of gmcs .",

    "model yg1 , with both gas and gmcs , has a distinctly less prominent bar section than the other three models .",
    "we have already seen that gmcs tend to weaken bars .",
    "the profile for yg1 signifies that gas also weakens bars .",
    "gas can weaken bars in three ways .",
    "one is simply by enhancing the effectiveness of gmc heating .",
    "another is by blowing mass out of the central galaxy , thus weakening the disc s self - gravity .",
    "the third way gas can weaken a bar is by carrying angular momentum over the bar s corotation resonance and then surrendering it to the bar : when a bar acquires angular momentum , it becomes faster , shorter and weaker  and conversely when it loses angular momentum to the dark halo .",
    "the first process will not be active in model ygn1 that has gas but no gmcs , and the radial profile in fig .",
    "[ fig : gasgmc ] indicates that the bar in this system is significantly shorter than that in yn1 , which has neither gas nor gmcs .",
    "thus on its own gas does not prevent bar formation , but it does limit bar growth . acting in concert with gmcs , gas can strongly delay bar formation .",
    "note that the radial profiles show only stellar mass . as gas models",

    "still , at large @xmath82 the radial profiles of the two models without gas fall off less steeply than the profiles of the models with gas . that is , adding gas reduces the scalelength of the final disc .",
    "presumably , this is partly a side effect of reducing the strength of the bar , and partly caused by viscous inflow of gas through the disc .",
    "we have already shown that most models with gmcs show exponential vertical profiles which lack thick components . among our y models ,",
    "we find @xmath199 five models which have noticeable wings at @xmath200 in their vertical density profiles , suggestive of a thick disc .",
    "apart from y3f , which has a very mild wing , all these models share with y4 a growth history in which the scalelength for star insertion rises only to @xmath201 , so the disc is fed compactly .",
    "model y4f@xmath119 stands out amongst these models in having a vertical profile that rather nearly matches that of our galaxy up to @xmath153 , but still falls off much more steeply at higher altitudes .",
    "apart from a compactly fed disc , y4f@xmath119 has a fixed inner cutoff and a star formation efficiency of only 4 per cent , so it combines strong gmc heating with strong spiral structure due to the compact feeding .    in this section , we compare y4f@xmath119 to one of the standard gmc models , y1 , which has inside - out growth to @xmath202 , star - formation efficiency @xmath56 and an adaptive cutoff , to understand the origin of the different vertical profiles . in the right hand panels of fig .",

    "this is in part because heating by gmcs is offset by adiabatic contraction as the disc gains mass , and in part because the mid - plane density is being constantly increased by the addition of star particles .",
    "the sudden increase in @xmath49 at @xmath205 _ does _ cause the vertical profile of y4f@xmath119 to change significantly , because the sudden increase in @xmath49 is not offset by a sudden increase in surface density or enhancement of density at @xmath206 .",
    "the sudden increase in @xmath49 is caused by a strong and extended @xmath207 mode developing in its disc , followed by a large bar structure .",
    "these non - axisymmetric structures cause strong radial redistribution of stars and lead to final scalelengths of the disc that are significantly larger than the compact input scalelengths .",
    "we find that using a fixed cutoff for y4 models leads to more extended non - axisymmetric structures and thus more strongly thickened discs , than an adaptive cutoff .",
    "for the y models with milder thick wings we find that their thick components arise from similar processes of smaller magnitude .",
    "when a star is scattered by a non - axisymmetric structure across the structure s corotation resonance , its angular momentum changes appreciably without any increase in the eccentricity of its orbit @xcite . since a change in @xmath208 corresponds to a change in the star s guiding - centre radius @xmath209 , this process drives radial migration .",

    "older stars could have reached @xmath218 from any radius in the disc , so the fact that their histogram of @xmath216 values shows the same cutoff implies that stars are not escaping from within the bar ( which by construction extends to @xmath220 ) .",
    "this conclusion is reinforced by the fact that a model such as yg1 , which develops a short bar very late on , has a histogram of @xmath216 values that has a peak of comparable width to that of yn1 , plus an extension at fraction @xmath221 that reaches to values of @xmath216 that are @xmath222 lager than those reached by the histogram for yn1 .",
    "we conclude that in our simulations bars play a minor role for radial migration to @xmath136 .",
    "sb09a showed that radial migration enables us to understand the chemical composition and widening age - metallicity relation of the snhd in a natural way from basic chemical evolution : metal advection by the inwards directed galactic flow and ( to a lesser degree ) the faster and earlier star formation make the inner regions of the galaxy significantly more metal rich than the outskirts .",

    "[ fig : thick ] we report the results of varying the way particles are added to ics a and e. these include ( i ) giving particles an initial velocity dispersion @xmath259 that declines from @xmath260 to the standard value @xmath261 on a characteristic timescale @xmath262 ( models a2@xmath117 , e1@xmath117 , en1@xmath117 ) , ( ii ) letting the scalelength for addition grow ( from @xmath263 to @xmath202 in e1 and e1@xmath117 and en1@xmath117 rather than fixing it at @xmath264 in e2 ) , and ( iii ) excluding gmcs ( en1@xmath117 ) .",
    "e1@xmath117 comes closest to the promise shown by e2 , but again provides far too few stars at @xmath265 .",
    "it produces a thin disc in better agreement with the data as it has a shorter bar of length @xmath266 that compares well with that in the mw .",
    "assuming @xmath267 at early times in e1@xmath117 compared to always @xmath74 in e1 only mildly increases the number of stars at @xmath268 .",
    "model en1@xmath117 , which differs from e1@xmath117 in lacking gmcs , has a similar thick disc , but , in common with other models without gmcs , a disc that is too thin .",
    "a2@xmath117 , which , like e1@xmath117 has @xmath267 at early times , is as bad at providing a thick disc as a2 , which has @xmath74 .",
    "it follows that choosing @xmath269 as in a2@xmath117 , e1@xmath117 and en1@xmath117 has little effect on creating a thick disc .",
    "the vertical profiles in the e models are very constant with radius ( with the previously discussed exception of buckled bars ) , as the thick discs are set in the ics , which by construction have radially constant vertical profiles , and the thin discs behave as in a typical y model .    from these experiments we conclude that the key to producing a thick disc is to put in place already at @xmath165 a rather massive , extended and thick component . by tweaking our parameters for the ic disc or applying even higher @xmath269 at early times , we judge that we could eventually produce a thick disc that is compatible with the data . however , completion of this programme would not in any way _ explain _ the observed thick disc .",
    "this situation contrasts with the situation as regards the thin disc and the bar , which we feel are nicely explained by many of our standard models .",
    "we now consider the impact of using a cosmologically unorthodox dark halo . in ic f",
    "the dark halo has an anomalously large scalelength @xmath270 and in consequence a lower than standard density in the visible galaxy ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ahalo ] ) . in ic",
    "g the dark halo has only half the standard mass , so again in the star - forming galaxy the density of dark matter is smaller than cosmology implies for the mw . reducing the halo s density at fixed disc mass favours early formation of a powerful bar .",
    "in fact , model f2 produces a bar that extends to @xmath271 .    as in a standard halo , a model with strong inside - out growth ( f1 ) develops a vertical profile at @xmath136 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : lowd ] ) , which deviates little from an exponential , while a more compact model ( f2 ) develops a stronger wing on its vertical density profile suggesting a thick disc . adopting the adapli cutoff ( described at the end of section  [ sec : addstar ] )",
    "enhances the wing ( f2l vs.  f2 ) .",
    "the early and powerful bar , combined with a reduced contribution to the vertical restoring force @xmath272 from the halo , makes the disc appreciably thicker than the equivalent disc formed with a standard halo .",
    "in fact , some models , for example f2l@xmath119 , produce discs that are thicker than that of the mw at @xmath273 .",
    "unfortunately , in all our experiments a suitable thick disc , as in model f3n@xmath119 out to @xmath274 ( magenta lines in fig .  [",
    "fig : lowd ] ) , which has no cutoff and an enhanced supply of gmcs , is always associated with undesirable features .",
    "one is a thin disc that is too thick .",
    "another is values of @xmath194 at @xmath136 that are too large , especially for old ages .",
    "a third is an over - long bar . on account of this long bar ,",
    "@xmath195 at @xmath136 is too large , especially at young ages .    the radial density profiles of the models with low - density haloes are diverse .",
    "none resembles the distribution of added stars .",
    "counter - intuitively , the adapli models ( names containing l ) are less concentrated than the standard adaptive cutoff models : adapli models acquire high central surface densities and powerful @xmath168 modes early - on ; these modes then efficiently redistribute stars in radius .",
    "as the amplitude @xmath169 quickly becomes strong in all f models , our procedure for adding stars on nearly circular orbits is questionable in these models .",
    "the particles do settle to orbits supported by the non - axisymmetric potential , but the large value of @xmath169 significantly distorts the radial distribution of recently introduced particles from that desired .",
    "however , large bars and strong low-@xmath275 spirals are an inevitable consequence of a high baryon fraction @xcite .",
    "similar to model y4f@xmath228 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : flare ] , the models in halo f all have vertical profiles that are considerably thicker in the outer regions of the discs compared to the inner regions . as none of the bars in these models buckles , the inner regions are always the thinnest parts of the models",
    ".      finally we briefly consider the effects of increasing or decreasing @xmath141 , the total baryon mass .",
    "our standard mass @xmath276 is in agreement with the @xmath277 determined by @xcite for the mw .",
    "models y1mb+ and y2mb+ have @xmath141 50 per cent greater than standard , while y1mb- and y2mb- have @xmath141 40 per cent lower than standard .",
    "increasing @xmath141 strengthens non - axisymmetries , and vice versa when @xmath141 is reduced . in section  [ sec : rmigrate ] we already noted that y2mb- has an unusually narrow distribution of @xmath216 and in section  [ sec : rhgrowth ] we noted that in y2mb- shows an anomalously small increase in the radial scale length @xmath235 with which coeval particles are distributed between addition and the final model .",
    "both these results are immediate consequences of smaller departures from axisymmetry .",
    "the deleterious effect of moving from the standard value of @xmath141 are nicely illustrated by fig .",
    "[ fig : y3032 ] : non - axisymmetries cause @xmath195 at @xmath136 to be too large at all ages in y1mb+ and too small at all ages in y1mb- . since gmcs couple horizontal motions to vertical motions , @xmath194 at @xmath136 is always too small in y1mb- . in y1mb+",
    "it is too large at old ages . with the standard disc mass",
    "both @xmath195 and @xmath194 are about right .",
    "it is worth noting that the scale - height @xmath232 of the disc is almost independent of @xmath141 because increasing @xmath141 increases both @xmath49 and the surface density of the disc and thus the gravitational force @xmath272 that together with @xmath49 determines @xmath232 .     in models",
    "y1mb+ , y1 and y1mb- which differ in total final disc mass .",
    "the data have been adjusted to simulate the uncertainties and biases in the ages of casagrande et al .",
    "( 2011),width=264 ]    these models show that our standard choices of disc and halo mass provide a balance between disc and halo gravity that is close to that present in the mw .",
    "consequently , models y1mb+ and y2mb+ also have circular speeds at @xmath136 that are too high . to get the rotation - curve constraints right",
    ", one would have to lower the halo density , which , as we have shown above , leads to problems with overly long bars . for our standard mass values ,",
    "50 per cent of the radial force at @xmath136 already comes from the dark halo .",
    "consequently , models y1mb- and y2mb- with lower disc masses have circular speeds that are only marginally too low .",
    "if we assume that the gmc heating in models y1mb+ , y1 and y1mb- is appropriate , the avrs in fig .",
    "[ fig : y3032 ] would suggest the actual mw disc mass is slightly above @xmath278 and the radial acceleration by the halo would have to be lowered mildly to account for the additional disc mass . due to the many uncertainties involved , such as halo shape and disc mass profile , detailed estimates are not appropriate here .",
    "inevitably , our models of growing disc galaxies in live dark haloes rely on idealised assumptions .",
    "the same is true for some of the analysis presented . in this section",
    "we discuss the impact of several of these assumptions .    for our analysis",
    "we have used azimuthal averaging to determine mass profiles and velocity dispersions .",
    "bars and spirals are non axisymmetric and also defining features of galactic discs , both in observed galaxies and in our models . in the presence of a bar , stars will stream outwards at some azimuths , and inwards at others .",
    "we have computed @xmath178 as the standard deviation of @xmath279 for all stars in a cylindrical shell , so any systematic radial streaming contributes to our reported values of @xmath178 .",
    "we hope in the near future to study the impact of the bar and spiral structure on the kinematics of discs .",
    "in such a study , the distribution of values of @xmath279 at any point would be decomposed into its mean @xmath280 and dispersion , and the latter would be smaller than the values @xmath178 reported here by @xmath281 , which would be small for the anticipated values @xmath282 .    on account of non - axisymmetric structures , perfect circular orbits",
    "do not exist in disc galaxies .",
    "however , we use the concept of an azimuthally averaged circular speed to insert star particles into our disc galaxies on near - circular orbits . outside the bar region",
    "this is justified by the finding that the radial velocity dispersion of young stars agrees with measurements in the snhd , which is determined not by input @xmath259 but by the local strength of non - axisymmetries . within the bar region ,",
    "we avoid inserting new stars by introducing an inner cutoff @xmath283 .",
    "this may seem a crude assumption , but bar regions in disc galaxies are known to be deficient in star formation @xcite .",
    "there is plenty of sf in the central @xmath284 of the mw ( central molecular zone ) , but in our models we are not interested in these central areas of disc galaxies , which are too small to affect the large scale dynamics studied here .",
    "moreover , models in halo y which set @xmath285 do not yield results which differ significantly from those with @xmath286 .",
    "our models deliberately lack a model for star formation from a gas component and for gas circulation including accretion and feedback , as these processes bring along both physical and numerical uncertainties of a severe nature . we find that the specifics of the setup of the initial disc and the insertion of star particles are unimportant for the outcome of our models , as long as the inserted stellar populations are sufficiently cold .",
    "we have shown that the insertion of gmcs has a much stronger effect on our models than the insertion of isothermal gas .",
    "this is because gas merely assists stars in forming spiral structure , which induces in - plane heating and radial migration .",
    "clouds , by contrast achieve something that neither stars nor gas can : scatter stars out of the plane and thus increase the disc s vertical scaleheight .",
    "although we have significantly updated the treatment of gmc populations compared to previous studies by modelling a gmc mass function , applying finite lifetimes , testing spatial clustering and having an evolving mass fraction of gmcs , our gmc particles are clearly an idealised representation of real gmcs .",
    "all our gmcs are assumed to have the same linear extent regardless of their mass , whereas observed gmcs have sizes which on average increase with mass , and the most massive gmcs can have radii in excess of the @xmath287 we adopt for the softening length of a gmc @xcite .",
    "however , real gmcs are not spherical and do not have spline - kernel potentials , but are strongly substructured with most of their mass concentrated in high - density clumps @xcite .",
    "as it is unfeasible to model this small - scale structure in galaxy - wide simulations , we choose to make a simple assumption about the potential of gmcs .",
    "another potential lack of realism is connected to the dark halo .",
    "although our disc grows continuously , the mass of our halo is fixed .",
    "our galaxy is generally believed to have had a quiet merger history since @xmath288 , and our goal is to simulate evolution since the last major merger .",
    "the inner @xmath289 of dark haloes with such quiescent formation histories are expected to have been almost completely in place by the end of the last major merger , as e.g.@xcite have shown with high resolution cosmological simulations of dark - matter - only haloes .",
    "the dark - matter profiles in this region are expected to be reshaped by baryonic processes ( e.g.  @xcite ) as they are in our simulations . in a forthcoming paper",
    "we plan to discuss the impact on dark matter of growing discs and their bars and spirals .",
    "our models produce discs with single - exponential vertical profiles , whereas the disc of the mw and comparable spiral galaxies have double - exponential vertical profiles .",
    "@xcite recently presented observations of low - mass disc galaxies with single exponential vertical profiles . compared to mw mass disc galaxies these objects are believed to have significantly lower baryon fractions ( e.g. @xcite ) . as we have seen",
    "that thick discs in our models are connected to higher baryon fractions , the question arises whether our models in the standard halo y on average have too low baryon fractions . at late times",
    "there is little room to increase the mass as was shown by the high mass models y1mb+ and y2mb+ . at early times ,",
    "our models have relatively high fractions of the total baryonic mass ( i.e. stars and gmcs ) in gmcs .",
    "the mass fraction is @xmath290 per cent for a model with standard parameters such as y1 and @xmath291 per cent if @xmath55 is lowered as in y1@xmath228 . yet , these fractions are still smaller than some of the molecular gas fractions reported at redshifts @xmath292 @xcite .",
    "moreover , mass loss by stellar populations to the gas phase , which is neglected in our models , is significant over @xmath97 , and thus old populations at @xmath97 could contribute higher mass fractions at early times .",
    "however , a significant part ( depending on the imf ) occurs due to core - collapse supernovae in the first @xmath293 of stellar evolution , which for our purposes is negligible .",
    "models with higher star formation rates in the beginning ( e.g. y1fs3 vs. y1f ) have also been shown to not significantly change our conclusions .",
    "our models have the same amount of radial migration as sb09a , b , but the stars migrating outwards from the inner disc are not as hot vertically as in those models , so our models do not produce thick discs .",
    "this points towards the necessity of an additional heating source for old / inner disc populations of stars .",
    "several possible sources , both secular and external , have been discussed in the literature : scattering of massive star forming clumps in turbulent high redshift galaxies @xcite , which can be regarded as an extreme form of gmc heating , the continuous decrease of birth velocity dispersion of stars in an interstellar medium which becomes less turbulent over time @xcite , star formation during a phase of gas - rich merger events @xcite or the heating of an early thin disc by mergers @xcite .",
    "the idealised simulations of @xcite , in which galaxies formed from cooling gas inserted to substructured dark haloes from dark - matter - only cosmological simulations , found that , in the absence of mergers , double exponential vertical profiles can arise in rapidly evolving young galaxies , in which the central triaxial potential first has to be restructured into an axisymmetric disc - like potential , which can host near - circular orbits .",
    "the fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of @xcite showed that the periods of disc settling in which the thin disc can survive over cosmological timescales , typically do not start prior to @xmath292 .",
    "the earlier periods are characterised by mergers , high gas accretion rates and probably strong stellar feedback , which prevent stable near - circular orbits .",
    "so , from a cosmological point of view , the existence of older and hotter stellar populations is certainly plausible . as our experiments with",
    "thick disc ics have shown , the appearance of these objects at the start of thin disc settling would have been less disc like than today .",
    "we have presented a large set of controlled simulations of growing disc galaxies within non - growing , live dark haloes .",
    "most of these models start from a thin , compact disc , with ten per cent of the final stellar mass , but we also presented models with initially more or less massive discs , and thicker discs .",
    "we also presented a model with a bulge rather than a disc in its initial conditions .",
    "the models grow by the constant addition of new star particles on near - circular orbits in the midplane of the galaxy . at any time particles",
    "are added according to an exponential radial density profile , but the scale - length of this profile can grow over time .",
    "the majority of our models contain a population of particles with masses in the range @xmath294 that represent giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) .",
    "these particles are short lived and have masses drawn from a power - law mass function .",
    "a subset of our models contain an isothermal gas component to represent the part of the interstellar medium that is not concentrated into gmcs .",
    "gas is added to the isothermal component to hold roughly constant the fraction of the disc s mass that is in smooth gas .",
    "we find that    * gmcs generate remarkably exponential vertical profiles .",
    "the scaleheight of this exponential can match that measured for the thin disc of our galaxy providing the efficiency of star formation is at the lower end of the estimated range and the masses of gmcs extend towards the upper end of the range of estimated gmc masses .",
    "these exponential profiles are very constant with radius , although buckled bars can produce deviations in the bar region . *",
    "heating by gmcs is particularly effective early on , when the sfr is high and the stellar disc is not yet massive .",
    "gmc heating significantly delays , and in some cases can even prevent , the formation of a bar . * in order to suppress spurious two body heating from dark - matter particles to a negligible level , several millions of particles in the live dark halo are needed . for such resolutions ,",
    "gmc heating is significantly more effective and even in the absence of gmcs , vertical profiles hardly change when particle numbers are increased . to resolve the vertical structures of young stellar populations , a force resolution at the sub-50 pc level",
    "is needed .",
    "* the role played by a smooth gas component is modest .",
    "it enhances the efficiency of gmcs by increasing their effective masses .",
    "it also reduces the lengths and increases the pattern speeds of bars , but only marginally . * within most models ,",
    "spiral structure drives a level of radial migration within the disc that agrees well with estimates obtained by modelling the chemical composition of the snhd . * unless the disc has an anomalously low mass , non - axisymmetric features in the disc cause the final scale length of the disc , @xmath235 , to exceed the scalelength according to which particles have been added to the disc . *",
    "the disc s scaleheight @xmath232 soon settles to a value that does not differ greatly from its final value .",
    "this is for two reasons : ( i ) the steady increase in the vertical velocity dispersion of a cohort of coeval stars that gmcs drive is partly offset by the disc s growing surface density , and self gravity ; ( ii ) freshly added stars are constantly reinforcing the density of the disc near the plane .",
    "* models in which the scalelength for mass insertion increases more rapidly ( stronger `` inside - out '' growth ) have weaker non - axisymmetric structures and on average shorter bars , and as a direct consequence , smaller values of @xmath295 and thinner discs .",
    "by contrast , the scalelength @xmath235 of the final disc is fairly insensitive to the rapidity with which the scalelength for insertion grows , as longer bars cause more radial redistribution . *",
    "the standard disc mass and halo parameters provide just the right level of self - gravity in the disc . increasing the mass of the disc yields values of @xmath178 , @xmath49 and @xmath296 at @xmath136 which are too high . reducing the mass of the disc leads to unacceptably low velocity dispersions and too little radial migration . reducing the central density of",
    "the halo leads to low @xmath296 , to bars that arise too early and are too long , and to excessive values of @xmath178 at @xmath136 . * in our models ,",
    "a thick disc is very hard to form .",
    "the only dynamically generated thick discs we find generate the requisite vertical velocity dispersion by o(1 ) departures from axisymmetry that extend to @xmath271 . in the case of the mw",
    "such departures are ruled out by two facts : ( i ) o(1 ) departures generate in - plane dispersions in relatively young stars that are too large , and ( ii ) they generally make the thin disc too thick",
    ". moreover , in these models the vertical profiles are significantly thicker in the outer disc than in the inner disc .",
    "* we can obtain a structure that approaches the observed thin / thick combination only by providing an essentially complete thick disc in the initial conditions .",
    "the requirement that the primordial thick disc ( ptd ) contain enough stars with the high values of the vertical action @xmath256 that currently occur in the thick disc , causes the ptd to be so extended vertically that it is not very disc - like .",
    "however , its radial extent must also be considerable because stars of the ptd do not systematically increase their guiding - centre radii : on average they do increase their angular momenta @xmath208 , but as the mass interior to an orbit increases , so does the value of @xmath208 associated with a given guiding - centre radius .",
    "hence at @xmath165 the ptd must already extend to @xmath297 given that the thick disc extends that far now .",
    "we are impressed that when we combine standard values for the disc mass and dark halo parameters with observationally motivated assumptions about the star - formation rate , the mass function of gmcs and the efficiency of star formation , galaxies emerge through complex dynamics that bear a striking resemblance to the mw : as functions of age , the horizontal and vertical velocity dispersions at @xmath136 are similar to those observed , the structure of the thin disc is about right , as are the length and strength of the bar .",
    "yet none of these quantities is prescribed by the admittedly rather arbitrary manner in which we assemble the disc : changing the disc mass , the halo density , the gmc mass function or the sfr efficiency from conventional values destroys one aspect or another of the agreement between dynamical model and observation .",
    "we consider that this outcome constitutes a significant endorsement of @xmath298cdm cosmology and implies that our prescriptions capture many of the essential features of the physics of galaxy formation that shape disc galaxies .",
    "our models provide a natural explanation of the observation that the fraction of barred disc galaxies decreases with increasing redshift @xcite : increasing mass renders a disc more vulnerable to bar formation both because it puts the disc more in charge of the gravitational field in which it rotates , and because the effectiveness of heating by gmcs declines with the ratio of the mass of a gmc to the disc mass . in our simulations",
    "the timing and violence of bar formation are critical for the properties of the final disc .",
    "an issue for a subsequent paper is the impact on the morphology of the bar of disc buckling after the bar has attained a critical strength .    for our models ,",
    "the only way to obtain a thick disc like that of the mw appears to be to add it to the ics .",
    "this finding suggests that the mw s thick disc was present already at @xmath292 and is a relic of the time before the mw settled to its long period of secular growth .",
    "it also strongly suggests that thick disc formation requires additional sources of heat in addition to gmcs and non - axisymmetric disc structures .",
    "the additional heat may have been provided by high - redshift mergers and/or it may have been inherited from strong turbulent motions in the early disc . in contrast ,",
    "gmcs and disc structure apparently account for the full heating observed in the thin disc population of the snhd and thin components of external galaxies .",
    "the mw is a more complex machine than can be adequately characterised by the standard parameters , such as @xmath235 , @xmath299 , @xmath300 , @xmath301 , @xmath302 , etc . while not as complex as the mw , our models are also too complex to be adequately characterised by a few parameters",
    ". it will be interesting to compare mock observations drawn from some of them to see whether they agree with the mw better than any naive model , and to identify residual points of conflict .",
    "for example , the circular - speed curve of the galaxy is poorly known because the data are significantly affected by spiral structure and the bar .",
    "it will be interesting to compare with data stellar kinematics and gas line - of - sight velocities drawn from promising models .",

    "<S> we perform a series of controlled @xmath0-body simulations of growing disc galaxies within non - growing , live dark matter haloes of varying mass and concentration . </S>",
    "<S> our initial conditions include either a low - mass disc or a compact bulge . </S>",
    "<S> new stellar particles are continuously added on near - circular orbits to the existing disc , so spiral structure is continuously excited . to study the effect of combined spiral and giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) heating on the discs we introduce massive , short - lived particles that sample a gmc mass function . </S>",
    "<S> an isothermal gas component is introduced for a subset of the models . </S>",
    "<S> we perform a resolution study and vary parameters governing the gmc population , the histories of star formation and radial scale growth . models with gmcs and standard values for the disc mass and halo density provide the right level of self - gravity to explain the age velocity dispersion relation of the solar neighbourhood ( snhd ) . </S>",
    "<S> gmc heating generates remarkably exponential vertical profiles with scaleheights that are radially constant and agree with observations of galactic thin discs . </S>",
    "<S> gmcs are also capable of significantly delaying bar formation . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of spiral induced radial migration agrees with what is required for the metallicity distribution of the snhd . </S>",
    "<S> however , in our standard models the outward migrating populations are not hot enough vertically to create thick discs . </S>",
    "<S> thick discs can form in models with high baryon fractions , but the corresponding bars are too long , the young stellar populations too hot and the discs flare considerably .    </S>",
