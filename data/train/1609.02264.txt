    "the idea that the spontaneous breaking of a ( approximate ) dilatational or scale symmetry and the associated ( pseudo ) nambu ",
    "goldstone boson ( i.e. , the dilaton ) play a certain role in elementary particle physics dates back to the 1970 s  @xcite . for recent investigations ,",
    "see for example refs .",
    "@xcite and references cited therein .",
    "this interesting idea has again attracted attention recently as it might provide a natural understanding on the appearance of a _ flavor - singlet parity - even _ light meson in the @xmath14 @xmath15 gauge theory  @xcite .",
    "gauge theory with @xmath16 dirac fermions in the symmetric second - rank representation  @xcite . for recent review on lattice study of many flavor gauge theories ,",
    "see refs .",
    "the appearance of such a flavor - singlet light scalar meson is extremely interesting because , combined with the idea of the walking technicolor  @xcite , the light scalar meson might be identified with the light higgs particle .",
    "thus it seems quite interesting if the lightness of the scalar meson can be understood as a consequence of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a flavor - singlet scalar symmetry : the dilatational symmetry broken by the fermion condensate is a natural candidate .",
    "it is well - recognized , however , that it is not simple to formulate the spontaneous breaking of the dilatation symmetry .",
    "takahashi relation associated with the dilatation is almost always intrinsically broken by the trace or conformal anomaly ; this implies that one can not derive the corresponding nambu  goldstone theorem .",
    "the theories in which the dilatation holds in quantum level , i.e , conformal field theories , do not possess the dynamical mass scale and thus we do not expect the condensate of an order parameter .",
    "the notion of the spontaneous breaking of the dilatation and the associated nambu ",
    "goldstone boson must thus be essentially approximate .",
    "if we know a parameter which controls the validity of an approximate symmetry , such as the quark mass for the chiral symmetry in qcd , the notion of the spontaneous symmetry breaking of an approximate symmetry is still quite useful  @xcite . for the dilatation , however , it is not clear at all whether such a useful parameter which controls the magnitude of the trace anomaly exists or not .",
    "recently , golterman and shamir made an interesting proposal on this issue  @xcite .",
    "they take an @xmath0 gauge theory with @xmath1 dirac fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "if @xmath1 is within the so - called conformal window , @xmath17 , the theory can be conformal ; @xmath18 in the two - loop approximation . in  ref",
    "@xcite , the authors consider confining theories in which @xmath1 is outside the conformal window @xmath19 but is very close to the lower boundary of the window , @xmath20 .",
    "if @xmath1 is very close to  @xmath21 , the @xmath22-function in the low - energy region at which the chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken might be regarded as very small and the ward ",
    "takahashi relation associated with the dilatation could be regarded approximately restored ; this is the basic idea of  ref .",
    "further , to introduce a parameter which controls the `` closeness '' to the window boundary , they consider the veneziano limit  @xcite in which @xmath23 while the ratio @xmath24 is kept fixed .",
    "then @xmath25 may be regarded as a continuous parameter and the difference  @xmath26 , where @xmath27 , would be used to parametrize the `` smallness '' of the dilatational symmetry breaking in quantum theory .    on the basis of the above idea , in  ref .",
    "@xcite , golterman and shamir formulated an effective field theory which describes the low - energy physics of the pion and the dilaton in an @xmath0 gauge theory with @xmath1 flavors .",
    "it is then interesting to study consequences of the effective theory and compare them with results of the lattice simulation for example , to examine whether the picture of the `` spontaneous dilatational symmetry breaking '' is physically relevant or not .",
    "this is the motivation of the present work .    in the present paper , by employing the formulation of  ref .",
    "@xcite with an important modification elucidated in  sect .",
    "[ sec:2.2 ] , we derive a relation between the dilaton mass squared  @xmath2 , with and without the fermion mass  @xmath3 , and the pion mass squared  @xmath4 to the leading order of the chiral logarithm . this relation is analogous to a similar relation obtained by matsuzaki and yamawaki in  ref .",
    "@xcite on the basis of a somewhat different low - energy effective theory .",
    "our relation reads @xmath28 with @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and  @xmath8 are decay constants of the pion and the dilaton , respectively .",
    "our mass relation differs from the one derived by matsuzaki and  yamawaki on the points that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass anomalous dimension , and the leading chiral logarithm correction is  @xmath11 . the relation in  ref .",
    "@xcite has already been utilized to estimate the dilaton decay constant  @xmath8 from lattice data  @xcite . for  @xmath12 ,",
    "the value of the decay constant  @xmath8 estimated from our mass relation becomes @xmath13 larger than @xmath8 estimated from the relation of matsuzaki and  yamawaki .",
    "we hope that our mass relation will be examined by lattice simulations in the future in the parameter region in which the finite volume effect is well under control .",
    "we basically follow the notation of  ref .  @xcite .",
    "@xcite , our microscopic theory is an @xmath0 gauge theory with @xmath1 dirac fermions in the fundamental representation .",
    "we assume the dimensional regularization with the spacetime dimension  @xmath29 , which will be especially useful in what follows .",
    "thus we set @xmath30 , where the lagrangian density is @xmath31 where @xmath32 and  @xmath33 .    to constrain the possible form of the low - energy effective theory , following ref .",
    "@xcite ( see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , we introduce spurious fields , @xmath34 which is an @xmath35 matrix field and @xmath36 , corresponding to the chiral symmetry and the dilatational symmetry , respectively .",
    "the action is thus modified as @xmath37     \\psi(x)\\biggr\\ } , \\label{eq:(2.2)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that it is invariant under the @xmath38 chiral transformation and the dilatation .",
    "the former is given by ( @xmath39 , @xmath40 ) @xmath41 and other fields are kept intact .",
    "the latter is realized by ( @xmath42 ) @xmath43 these symmetries are of course spurious and , going back to the original theory   by setting , @xmath44 the symmetries are explicitly broken . still , these spurious symmetries are quite useful to determine the possible form of the corresponding effective theory .",
    "now , one of the crucial relations for our argument is @xmath45 where we have introduced the notation @xmath46 or , equivalently , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the renormalized spurion field : @xmath49 in deriving  eq .",

    "<S> recently , golterman and shamir presented an effective field theory which is supposed to describe the low - energy physics of the pion and the dilaton in an @xmath0 gauge theory with @xmath1 dirac fermions in the fundamental representation . by employing this formulation with a slight but important modification </S>",
    "<S> , we derive a relation between the dilaton mass squared  @xmath2 , with and without the fermion mass  @xmath3 , and the pion mass squared  @xmath4 to the leading order of the chiral logarithm . </S>",
    "<S> this is analogous to a similar relation obtained by matsuzaki and  yamawaki on the basis of a somewhat different low - energy effective field theory . </S>",
    "<S> our relation reads @xmath5 with  @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and  @xmath8 are decay constants of the pion and the dilaton , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this mass relation differs from the one derived by matsuzaki and  yamawaki on the points that @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the mass anomalous dimension , and the leading chiral logarithm correction is  @xmath11 . for  @xmath12 , the value of the decay constant  @xmath8 estimated from our mass relation becomes @xmath13 larger than @xmath8 estimated from the relation of matsuzaki and  yamawaki . </S>"
