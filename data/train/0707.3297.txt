    "one of the intriguing features of the recently discovered noncentrosymmetric superconductors @xcite is the realization of parity violated cooper pairs , which leads various exotic phenomena .",
    "@xcite the investigations for unique effects characterizing parity violation have been mainly focused on the case with strongly broken inversion symmetry ( is ) , where the spin - orbit ( so ) band splitting @xmath3 is enormous compared to the superconducting ( sc ) gap @xmath4 , because it is commonly believed , and partly true , that effects due to broken is are more prominent for stronger so interaction . however , in the present paper , we propose the possibility of novel phenomena which characterize parity violated cooper pairs in a unique way inherent in _ weakly _ noncentrosymmetric systems .",
    "these phenomena are essentially raised by the zeeman effect on pairing states in the so split two bands . in the weakly noncentrosymmetric case @xmath5 , the zeeman magnetic field induces substantial pair correlation between the so split different bands competing with the intra - band pairs , which is , in contrast , negligible in strongly noncentrosymmetric systems with @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite we demonstrate that the field - induced inter - band pair correlation changes drastically low - energy properties of the sc state in the case with _",
    "weakly _ broken is , yielding the following unique effects ; ( i ) the pauli depairing effect is anisotropic in the momentum space , and as a result , magnetic fields induce the point - node - like structure of the excitation gap even for isotropic s - wave states , which seriously affects thermodynamic quantities , yielding distinct behaviors of them at low temperatures .",
    "( ii ) for @xmath7 , the specific heat as a function of magnetic fields exhibits a two - gap like behavior even when there is only a single sc gap .",
    "these effects are associated with the momentum - dependent spin orientation of cooper pairs which characterizes parity violation .",
    "thus , our results suggest a possible new direction of the experimental search for parity - violated cooper pairs .    as a matter of fact , our findings are relevant to the recent experimental studies on the weakly noncentrosymmetric superconductor y@xmath1c@xmath2.@xcite this system has a cubic crystal structure with the space group symmetry @xmath8 breaking inversion symmetry .",
    "thus , the asymmetric so interaction can be approximated by the dresselhaus type interaction .",
    "the unique feature of this system is that the so splitting is almost of the same order as the superconducting gap,@xcite and thus the situation considered in the present paper may be realized in this material . in the last part of this paper , we shall compare our results with the experimental observations for this system , and discuss the possible realization of the distinct phenomena characterizing parity violated cooper pairs in y@xmath1c@xmath2 .",
    "although the existence of the indispensable inter - band pairing correlation in addition to the intra - band pairs mentioned above plays an essentail role in the above unique phenomena , it also brings about some technical complexity of theoretical treatment , which hinders the elucidation of properties of weakly noncentrosymmetric superconductors .",
    "moreover , the magnetic field induces the orbital depairing effect as well as the zeeman effect mentioned above . to deal with these issues ,",
    "we first analyze exactly effects of the zeeman magnetic field on the quasiparticle energy , neglecting the orbital depairing effect , and , afterward , to take into account the orbital effect , we develope the quasiclassical method which extends the classical works by eilenberger@xcite and larkin - ovchinnikov@xcite to the case with both the intra - band and inter - band pairs . a similar quasiclassical approach was considered before by hayashi _",
    "et al._@xcite here , we obtain , for the first time , the explicit analytical solutions of the eilenberger equations which encompass both the intra - band and inter - band pairs . using them ,",
    "we discuss behaviors of thermodynamic quantities under applied magnetic field , in which the above - mentioned unique features characterizing parity violated cooper pairs appear .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii",
    ", we investigate the zeeman field effect in weakly noncentrosymmetric superconductor with the dresselhaus type so interaction , neglecting the orbital depairing effect , and demonstrate that in the case of @xmath9 the pauli depairing effect is anisotropic in the momentum space , leading the point - node - like anisotropic structure of excitation energy gap .",
    "this phenomenon should be important in the mixed state of type ii superconductors .",
    "thus , in sec.iii , we develope the quasiclassical method , taking into account the orbital depairing effect in addition to the above - mentioned anisotropic pauli depairing effect .",
    "based upon this method , in sec .",
    "iv , we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the mixed state , and elucidate how the above features characterizing the parity - violated cooper pairs appear in experimentally observable quantities .",
    "it is demonstrated that for a sufficiently small so interaction , @xmath7 , the specific heat as a function of magnetic fields exhibits a two - gap like behavior even when there is only a single sc gap . we shall also discuss the implication of our results for the recent experimental researches on the weakly noncentrosymmetric superconductor y@xmath1c@xmath2.@xcite summary",

    "we concentrate on the effects of the zeeman interaction , expressed by @xmath25 with @xmath26 , leaving the analysis of the orbital depairing effect until the next sections .",
    "when the zeeman term is added to the hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) , the magnetic field induces the pairing between electrons on the so split different bands , which gives rise to the pauli depairing effect .",
    "the important observation is that in the case of @xmath9 , cooper pairs with @xmath27 for which the spin degeneracy is not lifted by the so interaction are more seriously affected by the pauli depairing effect than electron pairs in the strongly so split regions , leading to the anisotropic pauli depairing in the momentum space .",
    "the anisotropic zeeman effect in the strongly noncentrosymmetric case has already been discussed by several authors.@xcite the unique point in the weakly noncentrosymmetric case is that this effect drastically changes the structure of low - energy excitations in the sc state , and yields the point - node - like structure of the single - particle excitation gap even in isotropic @xmath0-wave states . to demonstrate this",
    ", we calculate the single - particle excitation energy @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) by diagonalizing the above mean field hamiltonian ( [ model ] ) with the zeeman term expressed in the @xmath30 matrix form in the space spanned by the basis @xmath31 .",

    "@xmath32 is defined by the magnitude of @xmath36 for @xmath17 on the fermi surface satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "it is seen that the point node - like structure develops , as the magnetic field increases . as a matter of fact , the excitation energy @xmath28 is not truely gapless , but the excitation energy gap @xmath32 is strongly anisotropic with the structure similar to the point nodes , reflecting the @xmath17-dependence of the so term even when the superconducting gap @xmath4 is independent of @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , the excitation energy gaps @xmath32 for @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 ( equivalent to @xmath41 ) are equal , and given by , @xmath42 while for @xmath43 , @xmath44 with @xmath45 .",
    "it is easily checked that @xmath46 .",
    "the positions of the gap minima coincide approximately with the zero points of @xmath47 at which the so splitting vanishes .",
    "the quasi - particle excitations for @xmath38 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 behave like dirac fermions with _ mass gap _ given by eq.([gap1 ] ) .",
    "it should be stressed that in the situation considered here the single - particle energy gap @xmath32 does not coincide with the superconducting gap @xmath4 , which is @xmath17-independent .",
    "a similar anisotropic structure of the excitation gap also appears for the band @xmath50 .",
    "although we use the dresselhaus interaction in the present calculation , the point - node - like structure appears generally for any forms of @xmath47 which possess zero points on the fermi surface .",
    "the anisotroppic pauli depairing effect discussed in the previous section is particularly important in type ii superconductors .",
    "thus , in the following , we consider the orbital depairing effect as well as the pauli depairing effect on the basis of the quasiclassical analysis . for this purpose , we consider the green functions for quasiparticles defined on the so split bands , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 are the field operators for quasiparticles in the @xmath55-band corresponding to the energy in the normal state @xmath56 with @xmath57.@xcite as mentioned above , the inter - band green functions plays important roles in addition to the intra - band green functions .",

    "the origin of this behavior is understood as follows . for @xmath154 ,",
    "there are two different types of the pauli depairing effect ; i.e. ( i ) one due to the generation of the inter - band pairing correlation which , instead , suppresses the intra - band pairing , and ( ii ) the other caused by the asymmetric deformation of the fermi surface .",
