    "within the last few years exclusive photoproduction of vector mesons ( @xmath4 ) has attained increasing interest which has been stimulated by corresponding experimental efforts at desy and tjlab .",
    "the investigation of high - energy diffractive photoproduction at desy aims at a better understanding of pomeron phenomenology in terms of qcd .",
    "the 93 - 031 experiment at tjlab , on the other hand , is situated in the few - gev ( momentum - transfer ) region and tries to shed some light on the transition from the non - perturbative ( vector - meson dominance ) to the perturbative ( quark and gluon exchange ) production mechanism . for heavy - quarkonium channels the perturbative production mechanism becomes particularly simple . whereas @xmath5 and @xmath6 production can proceed via both , quark and gluon exchange , heavy quarkonia",
    "are produced via gluon exchange mainly .",
    "quark exchange is power - suppressed due to the small heavy - quark content of the nucleon .    in the present contribution",
    "we report on an attempt to describe photoproduction of @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons in the perturbative regime by means of a modified version of the hard - scattering approach ( hsa ) , in which the proton is treated as a quark - diquark rather than a three - quark system .",
    "this perturbative diquark model accounts effectively for quark - quark correlations inside a baryon and has already successfully been applied to the investigation of various exclusive photon - induced reactions @xcite .",
    "it provides a consistent description of baryon electromagnetic form factors , compton scattering off baryons , photoproduction of @xmath7 mesons , etc .",
    ", in the range of intermediate momentum transfers ( @xmath8 gev@xmath9 ) in the sense that data for these reactions are reproduced with the same set of model parameters .",
    "within the hsa an exclusive scattering amplitude @xmath10 can be written as a convolution integral of a perturbatively calculable hard - scattering amplitude @xmath11 with distribution amplitudes @xmath12 , which contain the bound state dynamics of the involved hadrons @xmath13 .",
    "for the photoproduction reaction @xmath0 this integral takes on the particular form @xmath14 the distribution amplitudes @xmath12 are probability amplitudes for finding the valence - fock state in the hadron @xmath13 with its constituents carrying certain fractions @xmath15 of the momentum of their parent hadron . in the diquark approach the valence - fock state of a baryon",
    "is assumed to consist of a quark ( @xmath16 ) and a diquark ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "the hard - scattering amplitude @xmath11 is calculated on tree level in collinear approximation .",
    "the subscript @xmath18 of @xmath19 and @xmath10 represents a set of possible photon , proton , and vector - meson helicities .",
    "the analytical results are conveniently expressed in terms of mandelstam variables @xmath20 , and @xmath21 , which are obtained by neglecting the proton mass .",
    "all hadron masses , however , are fully taken into account in flux and phase - space factors .",
    "the model , as applied in refs .",
    "@xcite includes scalar as well as axial - vector diquarks .",
    "feynman rules , the quark - diquark distribution amplitude of the proton , and further details of the diquark model can be found in ref .",
    "the numerical values of the model parameters for the present work are also adopted from that paper . in order to describe @xmath2- and @xmath3-meson photoproduction",
    "simultaneously we have modified the @xmath2-meson distribution amplitude proposed by benayoun and chernyak  @xcite by attaching a flavor dependent exponential factor ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) .    unlike the pure hsa , in which hadron masses are completely neglected in the calculation of the hard - scattering amplitude , we include them in our calculation .",
    "this improves the applicability of the model at momentum transfers of only a few gev , where mass effects may still be important .",
    "our treatment of mass effects parallels the one described in detail in ref",
    ".  @xcite . in that work",
    "an expansion in powers of @xmath22 at fixed scattering angle has been performed . only leading order and next - to - leading order terms in the expansion",
    "have been kept .",
    "whereas this procedure gives a reasonable description of photoproduction of @xmath2 mesons in the few - gev momentum - transfer range , it fails in the case of the heavier @xmath3 mesons .",
    "therefore we take the @xmath3 mass fully into account , treat the proton - mass , however , still like in ref .  @xcite .",
    "[ fig - jpsi ]    photoproduction of @xmath2 mesons in the forward - scattering domain can be well described by simple pomeron phenomenology @xcite . at higher momentum transfers",
    "a qcd - inspired version of the pomeron - exchange model has been proposed by laget and mendez - galain @xcite , in which the pomeron is replaced by two ( abelian ) gluons .",
    "if only those graphs are taken into account in which the two gluons couple to the same quark in the proton , the two - gluon cross section exhibits a characteristic node due to an interference of the two different feynman diagrams contributing to the photoproduction amplitude . by additionally considering diagrams ,",
    "in which the gluons couple to different quarks in the proton this node is completely washed out  @xcite . for @xmath23",
    "gev@xmath9 the resulting differential cross section becomes then comparable with the diquark - model prediction  @xcite .",
    "this similarity is not surprising since it is known that the hard - scattering mechanism , i.e. diagrams without loops , in which all hadronic constituents are connected via gluon exchange , becomes dominant in the kinematic range of large @xmath24 and  @xmath25 .",
    "difficulties arise if @xmath3 production is considered .",
    "both , pomeron exchange as well as two - gluon exchange overestimate the differential cross section by at least one order of magnitude .",
    "the results are improved by arguing that the coupling of the pomeron ( or the two gluons ) to a charmed quark is weaker than to a strange quark . if hadron masses are treated like in ref .",
    "@xcite similar difficulties are encountered within the diquark model . with the modified treatment of mass effects",
    "in which the meson mass is fully taken into account ( for details see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) , this deficiency is , however , cured .",
    "figure  [ fig - jpsi ] shows the diquark - model predictions for @xmath26 at photon energies of 150  gev and 4708  gev , respectively , together with experimental data from fnal  @xcite and desy  @xcite .",
    "due to the lack of data in the region of large transverse momentum transfers ( i.e. large @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) a direct comparison of our predictions with experiment is not possible , since the perturbatively inspired diquark model is not expected to be applicable in the kinematic region of @xmath27 gev@xmath9 .",
    "the diquark - model predicitions with the @xmath3 mass fully included , however , extrapolate the low-@xmath24 data in a reasonable way . by comparing the leading and next - to - leading - order results of the expansion in @xmath28 it becomes obvious that such a series expansion converges rather poorly .",
    "a closer inspection reveals that the expansion coefficients are angular dependent .",
    "the leading - order terms are only dominant for sufficiently large deflections . towards smaller scattering angles",
    "mass - correction terms become increasingly important . for",
    "fnal and hera energies momentum transfers of a few gev just mean that we deal with nearly forward scattering and thus we should refrain from an expansion in the @xmath3 mass .",
    "as one would expect , the effect of taking the meson mass fully into account is much less pronounced in @xmath2 production than in @xmath3 production . for equal values of the mass - expansion parameter @xmath29 and of mandelstam @xmath24",
    "the photon laboratory energy for @xmath2 production has to be smaller by about a factor @xmath30 and correspondingly the scattering angle has to be larger , so that the leading - order terms in the mass expansion become dominant .",
    "but also in @xmath2 production the full inclusion of the @xmath2 mass has a positive effect .",
    "it slightly improves the angular dependence of the differential cross - section as compared to the approximate mass treatment of ref .",
    ". a full account of diquark - model predicitions for @xmath2 and @xmath3 photoproduction , which includes also spin observables , can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    to sort out whether perturbative photoproduction mechanisms already start to dominate in the few - gev momentum - transfer region precision data for @xmath31  gev@xmath9 are doubtlessly needed . a severe test for a perturbative model , like the diquark model , would , however , be its confrontation with data for polarization observables .",
    "hard scattering is closely connected with hadronic helicity conservation .",
    "polarization observables could help to reveal whether the inclusion of constituent - masses and two - quark correlations in terms of diquarks suffices to model higher - twist and non - perturbative effects , or whether other ( non - perturbative ) mechanisms have to be considered ."
