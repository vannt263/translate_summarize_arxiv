    "star cluster pairs are common objects in the magellanic clouds and it is important to understand their formation and evolution processes . a list of 30 cluster pairs in the smc was first presented by hatzidimitriou & bhatia ( 1990 ) .",
    "bica & schmitt ( 1995 , hereafter bs95 ) revised previous data on smc extended objects ( star clusters , associations and emission nebulae ) and identified new ones using sky survey eso / serc r and j films .",
    "they presented a list of 40 pairs and 2 triple star clusters .",
    "pietrzyski & udalski ( 1999a ) reported 23 pairs and 4 triplets derived from pietrzyski et al.s ( 1998 ) star cluster catalogue in the ogle survey area .",
    "bica & dutra ( 2000 ) updated bs95 s catalogue considering the entries in pietrzyski et al s catalogue .",
    "bica & dutra ( 2000 ) indicated 75 pairs and multiplets comprising 176 individual objects .    in recent years",
    "there has been growing evidence of interacting star clusters in the magellanic clouds , especially in the lmc .",
    "bhatia & hatzidimitriou ( 1988 ) concluded that more than 50% of lmc pairs must be physical systems .",
    "bhatia & mcgillivray ( 1988 ) found evidence that ngc2214 is a merging binary star cluster , based on the presence of a flattened core and an extended halo .",
    "indeed sagar et al .",
    "( 1991 ) detected two turnoff points revealing the presence of two interacting clusters .",
    "bica et al .",
    "( 1992 ) studied cluster pairs and multiplets in the lmc bar by means of integrated colours and found systems which resulted coeval and some with age differences .",
    "vallenari et al ( 1998 ) confirmed such scenarios by means of colour - magnitude diagrams .",
    "they also presented isophotal contours indicating physical interaction .",
    "several other studies have found binarity evidence in lmc cluster pairs ( e.g. kontizas et al .",
    "1993 , dieball & grebel 2000a , 2000b ) .",
    "bhatia et al . (",
    "1991 ) presented a photographic atlas of binary star cluster candidates in the lmc . for the smc no morphological atlas is available and isophotal maps",
    "are required to test possible physical interactions .",
    "indeed comparisons of isophotes with isopleth maps of n - body simulations proved to be a useful tool ( rodrigues et al .",
    "1994 , de oliveira et al .",
    "1998 , hereafter odb98 ) , since the simulations produce features such as bridges , common envelopes and extensions .",
    "the observational importance of tidal tails as interaction signatures was also indicated by leon et al .",
    "( 1999 ) .    in this work we provide isophotal maps for smc pairs and multiplets to study the following properties of these candidate physical systems : ( i ) angular distribution ; ( ii ) projected centre - to - centre separation of members ; ( iii ) isophotal structures using the digitized sky survey@xmath6 ( hereafter dss ) ; ( iv ) ages derived by means of isochrone fitting , when possible .",
    "we discuss candidate physical systems and infer a scenario for their formation and evolution .    in sect .",
    "2 we gather the objects providing coordinates , sizes , centre - to - centre separations and other details for the smc pairs and multiplets . in sect .",
    "3 we provide the isophotal contour atlas together with classifications of interaction features whenever present .",
    "a preliminary version of the present isophotal smc atlas together with one for the lmc was given in de oliveira ( 1996 ) . in sect .",
    "4 we derive cluster ages by means of colour - magnitude diagrams extracted from the ogle - ii bvi photometric survey ( udalski et al .",
    "1998 ) . in sect .",
    "5 we discuss the properties of the systems and the possible scenarios for their origin and evolution . finally , concluding remarks are given in sect .",
    "table  [ tab : catalog ] shows data for the 176 smc objects which form 75 star cluster pairs and multiplets ( bica & dutra 2000 ) , considering that the pair bs63/b67 in the latter study is possibly a triplet with ngc294 ( odb98 ) . by columns : ( 1 ) object cross - identification in the different catalogues : n ( henize 1956 ) ,",

    "there are 56 pairs , 15 triplets , 2 quadruplets , 1 quintuplet and 1 sextuplet .",
    "the quintuplet is located in the star forming region ngc395 with dimensions 25 pc x 18 pc which in turn is embedded in the hii complex smc - dem126 with 66 pc x 35 pc according to angular sizes in bs95 . the sextuplet is mostly contained in the ob association h - a35 ( hodge 1985 ) with dimensions 57 pc x 47 pc .",

    "for isophotal analysis purposes we extracted digitized images of pairs and multiplets from the dss .",
    "the plates are from the serc southern sky survey and include iiia - j long ( 3600s ) , v band medium ( 1200s ) and v band short ( 300s ) exposures .",
    "the pds pixel values correspond to photographic density measures from the original plates , and are not calibrated .",
    "the images were processed with the iraf package at the instituto de fsica - ufrgs , applying a 2-d gaussian filter to smooth out individual stars , producing isodensity maps .",
    "we show the isophotal atlas of smc star cluster pairs and multiplets in figs .",
    "[ fig : atlas1 ] throughout [ fig : atlas7 ] , where morphological evidence of interactions can be searched for . in each panel",
    "we point members and provide designations .",
    "cluster pairs and multiplets with evidence of physical interaction are marked in column 6 of table  [ tab : interact ] .",
    "their isophotal maps show features such as isophotal distortions , common envelope , isophotal twistings , etc .",
    "we classified these isophotal maps according to the following criteria : ( i ) isophotes of the members are detached ( * d * ) , but showing isophotal distortions ; ( ii ) isophotes of the members are connected by a `` bridge '' ( * b * ) ; ( iii ) the members are embedded in the same isophotal envelope ( * e * ) .",
    "these classification criteria are an important tool for a selection of interacting cluster pair candidates , since such isophotal morphologies are predominant in n - body model encounters ( rodrigues et al .",
    "1994 , odb98 ) .",
    "the classifications above were made for objects not disturbed by gas emission .",
    "it is worth noting that both bridges and envelopes imply a common outer isophotal , however the former includes a dimension which is considerably smaller than the smaller cluster diameter .",
    "the pair b59/smc - n46 would be an envelope limiting case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas4 ] ) .    as examples ,",
    "the pair h86 - 186/ic1612 ( fig .  [ fig : atlas5 ] ) is embedded in the same isophotal envelope and it is classified as * e*. the pair h86 - 140/h86 - 139 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas4 ] ) shows a bridge linking its members and is classificated as * b*. in fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas6 ] the pair ngc376/bs114 shows isophotal distortions , however the outer isophotes of the components are not connected and it is thus classified as * d*.    we detected relevant isophotal features for about 25% of the sample distributed as follows : 6 candidate cluster systems with common envelope , 7 with bridge and 5 detached cases .",
    "high isophotal densities such as those observed for b78/l51 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas5 ] ) are related to the high surface brightness which often occurs in blue clusters .",
    "it is important to note that non relevant isophotal features can appear in the maps caused by bright stars or background fluctuations . by means of previous inspections in the original images we verified the non relevant objects .",
    "for example , the compact object in the lower right corner of the b39/bs30 isophotal map ( fig .",
    "[ fig : atlas2 ] ) is a bright star , however the compact one to the right of the main cluster can be a star or a compact cluster , as seen in the original form .",

    "the third peak in the present study has no counterpart in both previous analyses , and it is probably an artifact from the low isochrone age step resolution in that range .    the solid line histogram in fig .  [ fig : age ] shows additionally the embedded objects in hii regions for which we assumed an age of 3 myr , and the objects from table  [ tab : interact ] with lower or upper limits by assuming them as the ages themselves . we can observe again a three peak distribution but the first peak is now shifted to the youngest bin similarly to pietrzyski & udalski s ( 1999b ) histogram .",
    "this suggests that only the 200 myr peak is relevant , being related to the smc / lmc last encounter ( gardiner et al .",
    "1994 , grebel et al.s 2000 ) .",
    "the maximum seen in the youngest bin is possibly related to the cluster formation / destruction rates . since the present sample deals with pairs and multiplets a fast destruction rate might be caused by the internal dynamical evolution in each cluster complex , caused by merger and/or other effects .",
    "approximately 55% of cluster pairs and multiplets in table  [ tab : interact ] present similar ages between their members indicating that they are coeval .",
    "this suggests that most of the pairs and multiplets had a common origin , possibly from the same molecular complex .",

    "considering triplet and multiplet members , we found that about 70% of them are younger than 100 myr .",
    "these results suggest a possible binary cluster formation scenario : clusters can be born in multiplet systems and coalesce by mergers and tidal disruptions forming binary clusters in a timescale of @xmath3 100 myr .",
    "this time is in agreement with dynamical times required for an interacting pair to merge into a single cluster ( odb98 , de oliveira et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "the pairs with a bridge in the isophotal maps have comparable ages for their components ( table  [ tab : interact ] ) . as examples , the pairs ngc241/ngc242 and b39/bs30 in fig .",

    "11 of odb98 ) .",
    "a typical timescale for the bridge phenomenon is @xmath3 30 myr , as deduced from a series of n - body simulations related to bridge formation and evolution ( odb98 ) .",
    "another interesting isophotal feature is related to the cluster triplet ngc220/ngc222/b23 which shows distortions for the small cluster in a direction almost perpendicular to the line connecting itself to the large components ngc220 and ngc222 .",
    "this configuration and morphologies are compatible with a fast hyperbolic encounter with small impact parameter ( e.g. fig .",
    "12 of odb98 ) .",
    "[ fig : distr_smc ] shows the angular distribution of pairs and multiplets together with smc hi column density isophotes from mathewson & ford ( 1984 ) .",
    "it can be seen that most of the objects are concentrated in the smc main body , close to the higher concentration of hi , so it is not unexpected that in general they result young ( sect .",
    "4 ) . the objects appear to be distributed along an axis .",
    "such distribution is present in the overall smc cluster sample and there is growing evidence that it is related to a nearly edge - on disk containing the bulk of the young stellar population in the smc ( bica _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 , westerlund 1990 ) .",
    "a nearly edge - on disk in a low internal reddening galaxy like the smc would imply an increase of projection effects as compared to a simulation such as that carried out by bhatia & hatzidimitriou ( 1988 ) for the nearly face - on lmc disk where the physical pairs would be about 50% .",
    "consequently the fraction of physical pairs in the smc would be lower .",
    "the present approach including morphological evidence of interaction is an attempt to constrain this aspect .",
    "indeed the fraction with isophotal distortions is only 25% ( sect .",
    "projection effects can be responsible for the age spread in some multiplets .",
    "for example the sextuplet ( table  [ tab : interact ] ) has component ages 80 myr ( b72 ) , 200 myr ( h86 - 143 ) , 50 myr ( bs257 ) , 3 myr ( smc - n52a and smc - n52b ) and 400 myr ( h86 - 148 ) .",
    "possibly only the 3 or 4 younger components could be related to ob - association h - a35 , the remaining objects would be captures or projection effects .",
    "this age spread is also present in ic1611 s quadruplet and in some triplets . on the other hand",
    "the quintuplet in the star forming complex ngc395 has all its members with the same age ( 3 myr ) thus forming a physical system .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : diam_smc ] we show the distribution of the diameter ratio between members for all pairs in the sample .",
    "the diameter ratio is mostly in the range @xmath19 , with a peak at @xmath2 indicating that the majority of pair members have a comparable size .",
    "this effect was also observed in the lmc ( bhatia et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "[ fig : separ_smc ] shows the distribution of the centre - to - centre angular separation between pair members .",
    "the separation range is @xmath3 @xmath20 arcsec ( @xmath33 - 22 pc ) with a pronounced peak at @xmath3 @xmath21 arcsec ( 13 pc ) .",
    "a similar peak was also observed by bhatia et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and de oliveira ( 1996 ) who found a bimodal distribution for the lmc pairs with peaks at @xmath3 5 and 13 pc .",
    "the observed upper limit of the projected centre - to - centre linear separation @xmath3 23 pc ( 80 arcsec ) is comparable to bhatia & hatzidimitriou s ( 1988 ) separation criterion for pairs in the lmc ( 18.7 pc ) .",
    "the frequent separation value around 13 pc may reflect a preferred survival distance for the systems , combined to projection effects .",
    "we presented an isophotal atlas for 75 star cluster pairs and multiplets in the small magellanic cloud , comprising 176 objects .",
    "it was possible to derive ages from colour - magnitude diagrams using the ogle - ii photometric survey for 91 objects .",
    "in addition we included in the analysis ages for 21 embedded objects in hii regions .",
    "the age distribution has a maximum in the youngest bin with a profile related to the cluster formation / destruction rates , in particular cluster multiple systems can have a fast destruction rate caused by their internal dynamical evolution .",
    "there is a second peak around 220 myr which is probably related to the smc / lmc last encounter .",
    "we find that 55% of the pairs and multiplets in the sample are in general coeval , indicating that captures are a rare phenomenon .",
    "most of the cluster multiplets occur in ob stellar associations and/or hii region complexes which indicates a common origin and suggests that multiplets coalesce into pairs or single clusters in a short time scale ( @xmath3 100 myr ) .",
    "the majority of the cluster members have comparable sizes , with a diameter ratio ranging mostly between @xmath19 .",
    "the projected separation distribution between the members of a pair has a pronounced peak at @xmath3 13 pc .",

    "<S> an isophotal atlas of 75 star cluster pairs and multiplets in the small magellanic cloud is presented , comprising 176 objects . </S>",
    "<S> they are concentrated in the smc main body . </S>",
    "<S> the isophotal contours were made from digitized sky survey@xmath0 images and showed relevant structural features possibly related to interactions in about 25% of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> previous n - body simulations indicate that such shapes could be due to tidal tails , bridges or common envelopes . </S>",
    "<S> the diameter ratio between the members of a pair is preferentially in the range @xmath1 , with a peak at @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the projected separation is in the range @xmath3 @xmath4 pc with a pronounced peak at @xmath3 @xmath5 pc . for 91 objects it was possible to derive ages from colour - magnitude diagrams using the ogle - ii photometric survey . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster multiplets in general occur in ob stellar associations and/or hii region complexes . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates a common origin and suggests that multiplets coalesce into pairs or single clusters in a short time scale . </S>",
    "<S> pairs in the smc appear to be mostly coeval and consequently captures are a rare phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> we find evidence that star cluster pairs and multiplets may have had an important role in the dynamical history of clusters presently seen as large single objects .    </S>",
    "<S> the images in this study are based on photographic data obtained using the uk schmidt telescope , which was operated by the royal observatory edinburgh , with funding from the uk science and engineering research council , until 1988 june , and thereafter by the anglo - australian observatory . </S>",
    "<S> original plate material is copyright by the royal observatory edinburgh and the anglo - australian observatory . </S>",
