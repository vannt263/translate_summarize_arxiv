    "in may 2014 , the object management group ( omg ) formally released version 1.0 of the case management modeling and notation ( cmmn ) @xcite standard specification .",
    "the specification is intended to support case management applications @xcite .",
    "cmmn is based on two models , a behavioral model and an informational model .",
    "the cmmn specification indicates that the information model can be implemented using the content management interoperability services ( cmis ) @xcite specification , however no details are given .",
    "this paper addresses that gap by describing how an cmmn implementation can use cmis effectively .",
    "this paper is intended for implementors of cmmn , and should be read in conjunction with the cmmn specification @xcite and the cmis specification @xcite .",
    "familiarity with the cmmn and cmis specifications is assumed .",
    "case management @xcite is intended to support the needs of knowledge workers when engaged in knowledge intensive goal oriented processes .",
    "it is common for knowledge workers to interact via documents ( e.g. text documents , word processor documents , spreadsheets , presentations , correspondence , memos , videos , pictures , etc . ) .",
    "case management shares most of the knowledge intensive processes characteristics as defined by di ciccio _ et .",
    "al . _ which are knowledge driven , collaboration oriented , unpredictable , emergent , goal oriented , event driven , constraint and rule driven , and non repeatable @xcite .",
    "therefore , it makes sense that a platform to support knowledge workers provide content management and collaboration capabilities .",
    "case management is defined by forrester as :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _  a highly structured , but also collaborative , dynamic , and information - intensive process that is driven by outside events and requires incremental and progressive responses from the business domain handling the case .",

    "these introductions describe the main concepts , classes , and objects that will be used in the rest of the paper .",
    "section  [ sec : main - alternatives ] describes the two implementation alternatives .",
    "section  [ sec : main - interaction ] describes how the cmmn information model could be implemented in a cmis repository .",
    "section  [ sec : main - models ] describes the implications for the cmmn models and for process interchange of case models .",
    "an example is given in section  [ sec : main - example ] .",
    "the example describes some of the functionality the end users will observe in a cmmn implementation that uses a cmis repository as described in this paper .",
    "conclusions are presented in section  [ sec : main - conclusions ] .",
    "two appendixes are included .",
    "appendix  [ sec : app - metamodels ] shows the cmmn and cmis meta - models for reference purposes .",
    "finally , appendix  [ sec : app - pseudocode ] provides an example java pseudocode showing a possible implementation of the cmmn information model in cmis .    .mapping cmmn information model to cmis meta - model [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "this section describes how to store the cmmn models in the cmis repository .",
    "it also describe the effects of using cmis as described in this paper on process interchange .",
    "the cmis repository can be used by the cmmn modeler tool to store the models .",
    "the modeler tool can take advantage of the versioning offered by most cmis repositories to maintain the versions of its models .",
    "it can also take advantage of the cmis folders to create project folders with the ability to create sub - folders to store the multiple assets of a project .",
    "in general , the cmis repository can be used as the modeler repository for cmmn models and other modeling artifacts .",
    "the cmmn models and other artifacts can be represented as ` cmis : document`s and stored in specialized ` cmis : document type`s and ` cmis : folder type`s .",
    "the cmmn model documents can have specialized meta - data for the cmmn modeler tool to use .",
    "for example , project name , department , etc .",
    "standard cmis meta - data can also be used by the cmmn modeler tool to keep track of its models .",
    "for example , ` cmis : name ` , ` cmis : description ` , ` cmis : createdby ` , ` cmis : creationdate ` , ` cmis : lastmodifiedby ` , ` cmis : lastmodificationdate ` , ` cmis : versionlabel ` , etc .      in order for the cmmn implementation to take full advantage of the capabilities offered by cmis ,",
    "few extensions to cmmn are required , as follows .",
    "` property ` types : :    can be extended as shown in table  [ table : fieldtypes ] to support    ` xsd : decimal ` , ` i d ` , and ` html ` types .",
    "note that if a cmmn application    is exclusively using a cmis repository then it would never encounter    one of these types .",
    "so these extensions may be optional . `",
    "casefileitem ` types : :    may need to be extended as shown in table  [ table : objtypes ] .",
    "this is    optional , because not all implementations will need to support all the    cmis objec types .",
    "implementations that need to support ` cmis : policy ` ,    ` cmis : item ` , or ` cmis : secondary ` will need to extend the    ` casefileitemdefinition definitiontype ` s uri as described in    table  [ table : objtypes ] .",
    "extended attributes : :    are needed in both alternatives . the _ embedded _ alternative requires    extended attributes to support ,    +    * ` index ` as an attribute of ` casefileitem `    +    the _ integration _ alternative requires extended attributes to support ,    +    * ` cmisobjectid ` as an attribute of ` casefile ` and ` casefileitem `    * ` index ` as an attribute of ` casefileitem `    * ` cmistypeid ` as an attribute of ` casefileitemdefinition `    * ` cmispropertyid ` as an attribute of ` property `    in cmmn 1.0 , these extensions affect process interchange .",
    "future versions of the cmmn specification may introduce extensible attributes and rules on how to preserve extended uris in ` casefileitemdefinition definitiontype ` s uri and ` property type ` s uri .",
    "currently , tools wishing to preserve cmis 1.0 process interchange may need to introduce an option when saving cmmn models to indicate if the model must be cmmn 1.0 compatible , and if so , the following transformations will be required , to remove extensions :    * remove the extended attributes as follows , + ` index ` : :    from ` casefileitem ` ` cmisobjectid ` : :    from ` casefile ` and ` casefileitem ` ` cmistypeid ` : :    from ` casefileitemdefinition ` ` cmispropertyid ` : :    from ` property ` * map extended ` property type`s as follows , + ` xsd : decimal ` : :    ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/propertytype/decimal ` ) to +    ` double ` ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/propertytype/double ` ) ` xsd : id ` : :    ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/propertytype/id ` ) to +    ` string ` ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/propertytype/string ` ) ` xsd : html ` : :    ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/propertytype/html ` ) to +    ` string ` ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/propertytype/string ` ) * map extended ` casefileitemdefinition definitiontype`s as follows , + ` cmis : policy ` : :    ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/definitiontype/cmispolicy ` ) to +    ` unknown ` ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/definitiontype/unknown ` ) ` cmis : item ` : :    ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/definitiontype/cmisitem ` ) to +    ` unknown ` ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/definitiontype/unknown ` ) ` cmis : secondary ` : :    ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/definitiontype/cmissecondary ` ) to +    ` unknown ` ( ` http://www.omg.org/spec/cmmn/definitiontype/unknown ` ) * review the generalizations from cmis classes in the _ embedded _ alternative , which are , + ` casefile ` : :    generalization of ` cmis : folder ` ` casefileitem ` : :    generalization of ` cmis : object ` ` casefileitemdefinition ` : :    generalization of ` cmis : object type ` ` property ` : :    generalization of ` cmis : property type `",
    "this example describes an hypothetical cmmn implementation using a cmis repository to implement the case file and to store cmmn models , as described in this paper . in this example",
    ", the implementation has two end user front end tools , the modeling tool and the client tool .",
    "both front ends may be integrated into a single user interface .",
    "the modeling tool allows users to create cmmn case models , and so , implements the design time aspects of cmmn .",
    "the modeling tool is used by business analysts or case workers to create , update , and manage cmmn models .",
    "case models are serialized into machine readable files as described in the cmmn specification .",
    "the files could be xmi or cmmn xml - schema ( xsd ) compliant files .",
    "those files are stored in the cmis repository as documents .",
    "the client tool allows case workers to interact with a case instance , and so , implements the runtime aspects of a cmmn implementation .",
    "case workers using the client tool are able to create case instances , interact with case instances by adding content , executing tasks and stages , engaging in planning by adding discretionary items to the case instance plan , collaborating with other case workers to complete case instances , etc .",
    "the case instance information model is implemented in cmis as ` cmis : folder ` representing the case file .",
    "therefore , each case instance will have its unique cmis folder .",
    "the user using the client tool can see the state of the case instance in the cmis folder and associated content .",
    "an example of a case file is shown in figure  [ fig : example ] . in that figure ,",
    "the case instance for project xx has a ` casefileitem ` data 1 with some properties , and a sub - folder for incoming documents with two documents , a house picture and a report document .    in a system with a clear separation between design and runtime ,",
    "a business analyst may create a case model and save it in the cmis repository using the modeling tool .",
    "the modeling tool may expose the cmis versioning capability .",
    "taking advantage of these capabilities , the business analysts may maintain multiple versions of the case model and may decide to deploy to a production system one of those versions .    in a system with no separation between design and runtime ,",
    "a case worker may create a cmmn model starting from scratch or using a template stored in the cmis repository . in both cases ,",
    "the resulting model may be stored in the cmis repository for future usage as a template . in systems with no clear separation between design and runtime , models will normally start incomplete and will evolve as the case workers process the instance .",
    "these case models will continually evolve , and so , the version capabilities of cmis will be used to keep track of the evolution of the model .    eventually a case instance will be created and case workers will collaborate to complete the case using the client tool . documents of multiple types maybe required to process the case instance .",
    "for example , emails , word processing documents , spreadsheets , pictures , videos , voice recordings , case comments , etc . those documents will be stored in the case folder . to organize those documents , the case workers may decide to create a folder structure under the case folder . for example",
    ", it may be useful to create a sub - folder for correspondence .",
    "that correspondence sub - folder may be further subdivided into an incoming correspondence sub - folder and an outgoing correspondence sub - folder .",
    "in addition to the client tool that allows the case workers to interact with the case instance , other cmis client programs could also interact with the case folder .",
    "documents in the case instance may be created by the case workers or it may be placed in the case instance by computer programs using the cmis api to access the case file .",
    "events are raised when documents are added to the case , are modified , or are removed . because both documents and folders are ` casefileitem`s , those events can be used in entry or exit criterion to tasks , stages , or milestones .",
    "so , as the case file is modified by either the case workers using the client tool or cmis clients interact with the case file , then entry or exit criterion may be triggered .",
    "this paper described how to implement the cmmn information model using cmis .",
    "there is no need to extend cmis to be used by cmmn , and only minor extensions to cmmn are proposed in this paper .",
    "two implementation alternatives were described .",
    "an _ integration _",
    "alternative where an external cmis repository is used and an _ embedded _ alternative where a cmis repository is embedded within the cmmn engine .",
    "the _ integration _ alternative will be appealing to process technology vendors , and the _ embedded _ alternative will be appealing to content management vendors . in both cases ,",
    "the cmis repository can be used to store the cmmn models to take advantage of cmis versioning and meta - data .",
