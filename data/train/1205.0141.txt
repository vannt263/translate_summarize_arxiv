    "these diblock copolymers have negligibly small cmc , similar to phospholipids .",
    "since the connection points are round in the cryo - tem images , the structure is likely the former round - type connection structures ; the rim and octopus arms are made of one type of copolymer with a relatively longer hydrophilic chain .",
    "our simulation suggests that the octopus - shaped micelles are generally formed in binary mixtures of negligibly - low - cmc surfactants .",

    "octopus - like micelles appear as temporal structures .",
    "such temporal structures were considered in some experimental studies @xcite .",
    "our simulation results support the existence of these intermediate structures .    to control micelle morphology , several key quantities require to be tuned .",
    "the spontaneous curvature of the monolayer or the packing parameter@xcite of the surfactants determines stable local structure of each phase domain .",
    "the ratio of line tensions of the phase boundary and membrane edges determines the wetting condition for the membrane edges .",
    "the contact angles of a pore on the phase boundary are given by the young equation . at finite cmc",
    ", the excess surfactant can be dissolved from the micelles , and the composition of surfactants can be adjusted to their stable shapes . on the other hand , at negligibly low cmc , the number of surfactant molecules can be conserved in micelles .",
    "hence , discoidal and cylindrical structures can coexist in a single micelle , where the excess amount of cone - shaped molecules to surround the circumference form connected worm - like micelles .",
    "the micelle size can be controlled by kinetics as well as the volume fractions of the surfactants .",
    "the lipid domain size at the time of vesicle rupture determines the resulting bicelle size .    in this paper , we focus on micelle formation from a vesicle .",
    "the size and shape of micelles depend on initial conditions .",
