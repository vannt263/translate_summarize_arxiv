    "extending lattice qcd calculations to non - zero baryon - chemical potential or , equivalently , to non - zero net baryon number density is known to be difficult in general . however",
    ", important information on the qcd phase diagram can be deduced for small values of the chemical potential by using well established numerical techniques such as reweighting @xcite , analytic continuation @xcite or taylor expansion @xcite .",
    "we will concentrate here on the latter approach .",
    "not only do taylor expansions of thermodynamic observables provide information on qcd thermodynamics at small but non - zero chemical potential , the expansion coefficients themselves also are sensitive indicators for critical behavior in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition at vanishing chemical potential . as the chemical potential couples to the quark number current , which does not break chiral symmetry",
    ", it acts to leading order like a temperature variable .",
    "derivatives with respect to chemical potentials lead to susceptibilities which exhibit critical behavior similar to that of thermal susceptibilities @xcite .",
    "we will show here that a calculation of the leading order taylor expansion coefficient of the chiral order parameter , which defines a mixed susceptibility , allows to perform quantitative studies of the phase boundary between low and high temperature phases of qcd close to @xmath4 .    at non - zero values of the chemical potential a phase boundary in the temperature and chemical potential parameter space of qcd",
    "is well defined only in the heavy quark limit or for vanishing quark masses . in the former case",
    "the phase transition line corresponds to the first order deconfinement transition in the pure gauge theory . at infinite values of the quark mass",
    "this transition is independent of the chemical potential and defines a straight line in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane . for a large range of quark mass values",
    "the transition line is not unique .",
    "it characterizes a region of ( rapid ) crossover in thermodynamic quantities and a pseudo - critical temperature extracted from these observables may differ somewhat , depending on the observable that is used . in the chiral limit , however , the transition line is again well defined . for sufficiently large strange quark mass",
    "it defines a line of second order phase transitions in the universality class of three dimensional @xmath7 symmetric spin models @xcite .",
    "taylor expansions , analytic continuation as well as reweighting techniques have been used to locate the crossover line @xmath8 in the @xmath5-@xmath6 plane for small values of the chemical potential @xcite .",
    "these calculations , which have been performed for different flavors and various values of the quark masses , suggest that the curvature is small , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath9 decreases only by a few percent at @xmath10 .",
    "however , so far most lattice qcd calculations performed to determine the transition line have been performed on coarse lattices , _",
    "i.e. _ lattices with only four sites in the temporal direction for which the lattice spacing in units of the temperature thus equals @xmath1 . better control over the extrapolation to the continuum limit and the quark mass dependence of the transition line clearly is needed .",
    "so far studies of the transition line concentrated on its dependence on a single chemical potential , taken to be either identical for the light up ( @xmath11 ) and down ( @xmath12 ) quarks or of opposite sign .",
    "the former is the light quark chemical potential , @xmath13 and latter is the isospin chemical potential , @xmath14 for which direct numerical calculations are possible . in order to make contact to the situation met in heavy ion collisions",
    "@xcite one eventually wants to analyze the influence of non - zero charge ( @xmath15 ) and strangeness ( @xmath16 ) chemical potentials on the curvature of the transition line , _ i.e. _ , one should allow for non- vanishing up- , down- and strange - quark chemical potentials .",
    "for small values of the chemical potential this is possible in the framework we will outline here . at present",
    "we will , however , restrict our discussion to the case of vanishing strange quark and isospin ( electric charge ) chemical potentials .",
    "we concentrate on an analysis of the phase transition line in the chiral limit ( @xmath17 , @xmath18 ) where its dependence on @xmath19 is expected to be largest . we will present a calculation of the critical line for small values of the light quark masses in the scaling regime of the finite temperature chiral phase transition .",
    "this allows to use scaling relations to extract the curvature of the phase transition line in the chiral limit of qcd .",
    "the scaling relations naturally relate the curvature of the critical line as function of @xmath19 to the magnitude of a mixed susceptibility .",
    "we will perform our numerical calculations for ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd keeping the heavier strange quark mass close to its physical value and decreasing the two degenerate light quark masses towards the massless limit . on coarse lattice with temporal extent @xmath20 we will make use of a recently performed scaling analysis @xcite of the chiral order parameter performed with an improved staggered fermion action .",
    "this study showed that the chiral order parameter is well described by a universal scaling function characteristic for a three dimensional , @xmath21 universality class .",
    "as we are using a staggered fermion discretization scheme for our scaling analysis we expect that the transition in the chiral limit , performed at non - zero lattice spacing , is controlled by the @xmath22 rather than @xmath7 universality class .",
    "we thus will analyze our numerical results in terms of @xmath22 scaling functions .",
    "we will comment on the application of @xmath7 scaling relations later on .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will extend the scaling analysis of the chiral order parameter to lattices with temporal extent @xmath23 .",
    "this provides the basic parameters needed for a calculation of the curvature of the chiral phase transition line which will be discussed in section iii .",
    "we give a discussion of our results and an outlook in section iv .",
    "in the vicinity of a critical point regular contributions to the partition functions become negligible in higher order derivatives and the singular behavior of response functions will generally be dominated by contributions arising from the singular part of the free energy density or @xmath7 universality classes this does not hold for the thermal response function ( specific heat ) as the relevant critical exponent @xmath24 is negative in these cases . ]",
    "@xmath25 in addition to the temperature @xmath5 , light ( @xmath26 and strange ( @xmath27 ) quark masses we also allow for a dependence of the free energy density on the quark chemical potentials .",
    "close to the chiral phase transition temperature at vanishing chemical potential the singular part @xmath28 will give rise to universal scaling properties of response functions .",
    "this has been exploited to analyze basic universal features of the qcd phase diagram close to criticality @xcite .",
    "the singular part of the free energy density depends on the parameters of the qcd lagrangian , e.g. the quark masses , and the external control parameters , temperature and chemical potentials , only through two relevant couplings .",
    "these scaling variables , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , control deviations from criticality , @xmath31 , along the two relevant directions , which in the case of qcd characterize fluctuations of the energy and chiral condensate , respectively . to leading order",
    "the scaling variable @xmath30 depends only on parameters that break chiral symmetry in the light quark sector , while @xmath29 depends on all other couplings .",
    "in particular , @xmath29 will depend on the light quark chemical potential while @xmath30 remains unaffected by these in leading order , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the phase transition temperature in the chiral limit and @xmath34 , @xmath35 are non - universal scale parameters ( as is @xmath33 ) . while the combination @xmath36 is unique for a given theory , the values of @xmath34 and @xmath35 will change under rescaling of the order parameter @xcite .",
    "note also that they depend on the definition of the parameter introduced to control symmetry breaking , _",
    "i.e. _ the fact that we choose the strange quark mass to normalize the symmetry breaking light quark mass parameter . for the rest of this chapter we will not need to refer any further to the contribution of chemical potentials to the reduced temperature @xmath29 .",
    "we will come back to it in the next chapter .",
    "the singular part of the free energy , @xmath28 , is a homogeneous function of its arguments .",
    "this can be used to rewrite it in terms of the scaling variable @xmath37 as @xmath38 where @xmath39 are critical exponents of the three dimensional @xmath21 universality class @xcite , @xmath40 and @xmath41 for three dimensional @xmath22 models and @xmath42 and @xmath43 for @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "all parameters entering the definition of @xmath29 and @xmath30 , _ i.e. _ @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath33 may depend on the strange quark mass , but are otherwise unique in the continuum limit of ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd . just like the transition temperature @xmath33 , however , also @xmath34 and @xmath35 are cut - off dependent and will need to be extrapolated to the continuum limit .",
    "the universal critical behavior of the order parameter , @xmath44 , is controlled by a scaling function @xmath45 that arises from the singular part of the free energy density after taking a derivative with respect to the light quark mass , @xmath46 the scaling function @xmath47 is well - known for the @xmath22 and @xmath7 universality classes through studies of three dimensional spin models @xcite .",
    "this so - called magnetic equation of state , eq .",

    "it could be shown that the chiral order parameter can be mapped onto a universal @xmath21 scaling curve and the scale parameters @xmath50 could be extracted .",
    "as the calculations had been performed with staggered fermions the scaling analysis has been performed by comparing results with the magnetic equation of state for a @xmath22 universality class rather than @xmath7 as one should find in the continuum limit for two massless quark flavor . however , as has been argued in @xcite both scaling curves are similar in the limited range of z values , where this scaling analysis has been performed , and the scaling analysis could have been performed with @xmath7 scaling functions as well .    at least on these coarse @xmath48 lattices violations of scaling have been found to be small also for physical values of the light quark mass , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath51 .",
    "of course , it is to be expected that the scale parameters , extracted on coarse lattices with temporal extent @xmath48 , are subject to cut - off effects .",
    "we therefore extend the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite to smaller lattice spacings .",
    "we perform calculations on lattices with temporal extent @xmath52 .",
    "we follow here the discussion presented in ref .",
    "@xcite and introduce two order parameters , that are multiplicatively renormalized by multiplying the chiral condensate with the strange quark mass , but differ in handling additive divergences , linear in the quark mass , @xmath53 we use in our study data for the chiral condensate which have been collected by the hotqcd @xcite and rbc - bielefeld @xcite collaborations in their studies of the ( 2 + 1)-flavor equation of state on lattices of size @xmath54 as well as in the course of analyzing the transition temperature in ( 2 + 1)-flavor qcd @xcite .",
    "these calculations have been performed with the p4-action @xcite for three different quark mass ratios @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "we use subsets of these data samples which cover a small temperature interval close to the transition region , but covering also the region of the transition temperature in the chiral limit . for the smallest quark mass ratio this includes a set of 16 values of the gauge coupling which cover a temperature interval @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "typically ( 20.000 - 30.000 ) trajectories of 0.5 time - units have been generated for each set of quark masses and gauge couplings .",
    "the temperature scale used in our scaling analysis is based on calculations of the scale parameter @xmath59 that has been determined from calculations of the heavy quark potential performed on lattices of size @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "the basic approach for the scaling analysis on @xmath52 lattices is identical to that described in ref .",
    "however , as the calculations on the @xmath52 lattices have not been performed for as small light quark masses as in the @xmath48 analysis @xcite , where the smallest ratio was @xmath49 , we did not perform a separate analysis for the determination of scaling parameters in the small mass regime and a determination of scaling violating terms for larger values of the quark masses , as it has been done in ref .",
    "we perform a simultaneous analysis of data obtained for all three quark mass ratios and include scaling violating regular terms in the ansatz for scaling fits , @xmath61 with @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "this includes all the scaling violating terms also used on @xmath20 lattices . in our final analysis ,",

    "the main outcome of the @xmath23 scaling analysis , aside from confirming the good scaling properties of the order parameter at a twice smaller value of the lattice spacing , is a determination of the scale parameters and the transition temperature @xmath33 in the chiral limit , needed in the definition of the scaling variable @xmath77 , _ i.e. _ the determination of @xmath78 and @xmath33 .",
