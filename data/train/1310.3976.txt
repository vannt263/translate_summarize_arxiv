    "perhaps the most classical population model is the _ galton - watson branching process_. originally devised to model the survival of aristocratic patrilineal surnames , the galton - watson process may be described as follows : start with one existing particle . at every time step ,",
    "all existing particles reproduce an independent number of offspring and die out .",
    "the main question is then , what is the probability that the system survives forever ?",
    "by use of generating functions it is fairly simple to analyze this model , and in fact it is well known that in a galton - watson process with offspring distribution @xmath1 , the probability of extinction is given by the unique minimal solution of the equation @xmath2 $ ] in the interval @xmath3 $ ] .",
    "moreover , the solution @xmath4 satisfies @xmath5 if and only if @xmath6 \\leq 1 $ ] .",
    "( see _ e.g.  _",
    "@xcite for a thorough treatment . )    to make matters more interesting , one might add some geometry , by having the particles not only branch ( reproduce ) but also move in some underlying graph .",
    "this is the _ branching random walk _ model , which is described as follows : start with one particle at some origin vertex @xmath7 in graph @xmath8 . at each time step , all existing particles reproduce an independent number of offspring and die out .",
    "all offspring now independently choose a random neighbor of their parent s vertex , and move to that new position .",
    "thus , a specific lineage of particles performs a random walk on @xmath8 . a different way to view",
    "this model is as a tree - indexed random walk ( see @xcite for more on tree - indexed random walks ) where the domain tree is the tree of lineage formed by a galton - watson process .",
    "see the pioneering work of biggins @xcite and the survey by shi @xcite .",
    "both models mentioned above exhibit some sort of monotonicity , enabling coupling arguments . for example , put in an imprecise way , if one has more particles , the branching random walk is more likely to be recurrent .",
    "the additional particles only help it return to the origin .",
    "let us now introduce the model we work with , which we dub _ branching - annihilating random walk _ , or @xmath9 for short",
    ". start with a single particle at some origin vertex @xmath7 of a graph @xmath8 . at each time step , all particles independently reproduce ( or branch ) into a random number of offspring .",
    "these offspring then each choose independently a random neighbor of their parent s vertex and move to that neighbor .",
    "( so far , everything is identical to the branching random walk . ) finally , at every vertex at which there is more than one particle , these particles are eliminated ( this is the annihilation phase ) .",
    "@xmath9 is a model for population reproduction in some geometry , with a competition for resources .",
    "the annihilation phase can be viewed as there being only enough resources for one particle at every vertex of the underlying graph .",
    "let us stress that the difficulty in analyzing barw stems mainly from the lack of monotonicity .",
    "adding particles may on the one hand assist in the ultimate survival of the system , but may also hinder the survival , as these additional particles may compete for resources and annihilate others , resulting in too few particles to survive .",
    "it is most convenient to work with poisson distributed offspring , so for simplicity we will restrict to this distribution .",

    "as remarked above , @xmath9 lacks monotonicity , and thus it is not easy to analyze .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to ask the following immediate questions regarding the long term behavior .",
    "some of these questions are being studied by the authors in a separate work , for the case of @xmath8 being the infinite @xmath30-regular tree .",
    "suppose @xmath8 is an infinite transitive graph .",
    "if @xmath12 is either too big or too small , one may dominate @xmath9 by a sub - critical galton - watson process .",
    "thus , we are guaranteed extinction in either case .",
    "( this is not surprising , as too little offspring do not give a good enough chance of survival , and too many offspring create too much annihilation , thus again ruining the chance of survival . )    the immediate questions that arise regard a super - critical interval of survival :    * do there exist @xmath31 such that for @xmath32 there is positive probability of survival forever and for @xmath33 $ ] there is extinction a.s . ?",

    "our proof is general enough to tackle both regimes simultaneously",
    ".    it would be interesting to find out whether , for a fixed @xmath0 , the expected extinction time of the conditioned chain @xmath56 $ ] is decreasing with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath9 , or rather a continuous time versions , have been studied before , see _",
    "e.g.  _ @xcite .",
    "however , most focus on survival of the process , or stationary measures .    on the other hand , recently there has been considerable interest among the physicists to study the behavior of a finite population evolving under some stochastic dynamics near its extinction time and particularly to find ` most probable or optimal path to extinction ' @xcite .    to best of our knowledge",
    "this is the first work to study the `` extinction window '' for @xmath9 ; that is , the length of the last path to extinction .",
    "as our results show , at least in the mean - field case , this window is _ much _ smaller than the lifetime of the system , indicating that extinction is a `` catastrophic '' phenomenon - it occurs abruptly in a very short time frame .",
    "our analysis makes heavy use of the fact that on the complete graph the geometry plays no role , so that @xmath9 can actually be seen as a markov chain on @xmath57 , making the model simpler .",

    "this work was initiated when the second and third authors were in the statistical laboratory , university of cambridge .",
    "thanks goes to nathanal berestycki for making this possible .",
    "it will be much simpler to use the following equivalent form of @xmath9 on the complete graph on @xmath0 vertices .",
    "( here is where the mean - field structure makes the analysis much simpler . ) given that @xmath64 , i.e. there are @xmath26 particles at time @xmath50 , every particle branches into poisson-@xmath12 particles , and each of these chooses a new vertex , independently , and uniformly among all @xmath0 vertices .",
    "thus , due to the summability of the poisson distribution , at the branching phase every vertex receives an independent poisson-@xmath65 number of particles . in the annihilation phase",
    "only those vertices with exactly one particle survive to the next step , which happens at a given vertex with probability @xmath66 .",
    "thus , we have just shown that if @xmath67 is the number of existing particles in @xmath9 on the complete graph on @xmath0 vertices , then @xmath67 is a markov chain with transitions given by @xmath68 = \\operatorname{\\mathbb{p } } [ \\mathrm{bin}(n , b(x ) ) = y ] =   { n \\choose y } b(x)^y ( 1-b(x))^{n - y } .\\ ] ] this observation will be central it what follows .",
