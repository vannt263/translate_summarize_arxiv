    "although the standard model is very successful , new physics is called for in various places , such as neutrino - oscillation , dark matter ( energy ) and baryon - asymmetry .",
    "possible new physics beyond the standard model is being intensively searched via the measurements of time - dependent cp asymmetries in neutral @xmath2 meson decays into final cp eigenstates defined by @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the mass difference of the two neutral @xmath2 eigenstates , @xmath5 monitors mixing - induced cp asymmetry and @xmath6 measures direct cp violation .",
    "the @xmath7-violating parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11     from @xmath12 penguin decays  @xcite.,width=302 ]    in the standard model @xmath13 for @xmath12 penguin - dominated or pure penguin modes with @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) for final @xmath7-even ( odd ) states .",
    "therefore , it is expected in the standard model that @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 being one of the angles of the unitarity triangle .",
    "the mixing - induced @xmath7 violation in @xmath2 decays has been already observed in the golden mode @xmath19 for several years .",
    "the current world average the mixing - induced asymmetry from tree @xmath20 transition is  @xcite @xmath21 however , the time - dependent _ cp_-asymmetries in the @xmath22 induced two - body decays such as @xmath23 are found to show some indications of deviations from the expectation of the standard model ( sm )  @xcite ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "in the sm , cp asymmetry in all above - mentioned modes should be equal to @xmath24 with a small deviation _ at most _",
    "@xmath25 @xcite . as discussed in @xcite",
    ", this may originate from the @xmath26 truncation and from the subdominant ( color - suppressed ) tree contribution to these processes .",
    "since the penguin loop contributions are sensitive to high virtuality , new physics beyond the sm may contribute to @xmath9 through the heavy particles in the loops . in order to detect the signal of new physics unambiguously in the penguin @xmath12 modes ,",
    "it is of great importance to examine how much of the deviation of @xmath5 from @xmath27 , @xmath28 is allowed in the sm  @xcite .",
    "the decay amplitude for the pure penguin or penguin - dominated charmless @xmath2 decay in general has the form @xmath29 unitarity of the ckm matrix elements leads to @xmath30 where @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 .",
    "the first term is suppressed by a factor of @xmath34 relative to the second term . for a pure penguin decay such as @xmath35",
    ", it is naively expected that @xmath36 is in general comparable to @xmath37 in magnitude .",
    "therefore , to a good approximation @xmath38 . for penguin - dominated modes such as @xmath39 , @xmath36 also receives tree contributions from the @xmath40 tree operators .",
    "since the wilson coefficient for the penguin operator is smaller than the one for the tree operator , @xmath36 could be significantly larger than @xmath37 . as the first term carries a weak phase @xmath41 ,",
    "it is possible that @xmath5 is subject to a significant  tree pollution \" . to quantify the deviation ,",
    "it is known that to the first order in @xmath42  @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "hence , the magnitude of the cp asymmetry difference @xmath45 and direct cp violation are both governed by the size of @xmath46 . however , for the aforementioned penguin - dominated modes , the tree contribution is color suppressed and hence in practice the deviation of @xmath9 is expected to be small  @xcite .",
    "it is useful to note that @xmath45 is proportional to the real part of @xmath47 as shown in the above equation .",
    "below i will review the results of the sm expectations on @xmath48 from short - distance and long - distance calculations .",
    "recent reviews of results obtained from the su(3 ) approach can be found in  @xcite .",
    "there are several qcd - based approaches in calculating hadronic @xmath2 decays  @xcite .",
    "@xmath45 from calculations of qcdf  @xcite , pqcd  @xcite , scet  @xcite are shown in table  1 .",
    "the qcdf calculations on @xmath50 , @xmath51 modes are from @xcite  , while those in @xmath52 modes are from @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that ( i ) @xmath53 are small and positive in most cases , while experimental central values for @xmath45 are all negative , except the one from @xmath54 ; ( ii ) qcdf and pqcd results agree with each other , since the main difference of these two approach is the ( penguin ) annihilation contribution , which hardly affects @xmath5 ; ( iii ) the scet results involve some non - perturbative contributions fitted from data .",
    "these contributions affect @xmath55 and give results in the @xmath56 mode different from the qcdf ones .",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 are penguin - dominated and pure penguin decays , respectively .",
    "they are also used to extracted @xmath59 with results shown in fig",
    "three - body modes are in general more complicated than two - body modes .",
    "for example , while the @xmath60 mode remains as a cp - even mode , the @xmath61 mode is not a cp - eigen state   is dominated by the cp - even part and hence it is still useful in extracting @xmath0 . ] .",
    "furthermore , the mass spectra of these modes are in general complicated and non - trivial .    a factorization approach is used to study these @xmath62 modes  @xcite . in the factorization approach , the @xmath63 amplitude , for example",
    ", basically consists of two factorized terms : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath66 denotes a @xmath67 transition matrix element .",
    "the dominant contribution is from the @xmath68 term , which is a penguin induced term , while the sub - leading @xmath69 term contains both tree and penguin contributions .",
    "in fact , @xmath70 transition is a @xmath71 transition , which has a color allowed tree contribution .    results of cp asymmetries for these modes are given in table  iii .",
    "the first uncertainty is from hadronic parameter in @xmath72 transition in @xmath73 mode ( and a similar term in @xmath60 mode ) , the second uncertainty is from other hadronic parameters , while the last uncertainty is from the uncertainty in @xmath41 .    to study @xmath45 and @xmath8 ,",
    "it is crucial to know the size of the @xmath71 transition term ( @xmath74 ) . for the pure - penguin @xmath60 mode",
    ", the smallness of @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be easily understood . for the @xmath77 mode ,",
    "there is a @xmath71 transition in the @xmath78 term .",
    "it has the potential of giving large tree pollution in @xmath79 .",
    "it requires more efforts to study the size and the impact of this term .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath71 transition term in the @xmath77 mode is not a cp self - conjugated term , since under a cp conjugation , this term will be turned into a @xmath80 term , which is , however , missing in the original amplitude .",
    "hence , this term contributes to both cp - even and cp - odd configurations with similar strength .",
    "therefore , information in the cp - odd part can be used to constrain its size and its impact on @xmath45 and @xmath8 .",
    "indeed , it is found recently  @xcite that the cp - odd part is highly dominated by @xmath81 , where other contributions ( at @xmath82 ) are highly suppressed .",
    "since the @xmath83 term favors a large @xmath84 region , which is clearly separated from the @xmath85-resonance region , the result of the cp - odd configuration strongly constrains the contribution from this @xmath71 transition term .",
    "consequently , the tree pollution is constrained and the @xmath86 should not be large .",
    "note that results shown in table  iii were obtained without fully incorporating these information .",
    "the first uncertainty in table  iii will be reduced , if the cp - odd result is taken into account . to further refine the results it will be very useful to perform a detail dalitz - plot analysis .",
