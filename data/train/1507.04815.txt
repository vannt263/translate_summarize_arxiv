    "the abnormal attraction between likely charged particles has been widely discussed during the past decades @xcite since the experimental observation in colloidal @xcite and biological systems @xcite . the like - charge attraction ( lca ) at strong - coupling regime ( high surface charge , multivalent counterions or low temperature ) has been understood by particle - based computer simulations , and theoretical studies such as density functional theory and strong - coupling theory @xcite .",
    "colloidal suspensions in monovalent electrolytes are usually considered as systems in weak - coupling regime at which the mean - field poisson - boltzmann ( pb ) theory is generally useful .",
    "the forces between charged surfaces are usually modelled through the derjaguin - landau - verwey - overbeek ( dlvo ) theory , which combines the linearized pb equation with the van der waals interaction .",
    "however , the pb theory always predicts repulsive interaction between like charges @xcite , and the dlvo theory always overestimates the repulsion or underestimates the attraction @xcite , in contrary to the results of lca experiments for colloids @xcite , which demonstrates many - body effects are still significantly important at weak - coupling conditions and can not be ignored .    for colloids at small separation , the depletion force induced by the entropic repulsion of small particles in the solvent could result in an effective inter - colloid attraction .",
    "the finite size excluded volume effect could result in a depletion layer , the surfaces are attractive for the separation at the range of the small particle diameter @xcite . in electrolytes , this attractive distance can be much larger , comparable with the debye screening length due to the long - range nature of electrostatic interaction @xcite . in this sense",
    ", the van der waals and the casimir force @xcite which can also result in attractive potentials could be ignored in the lca analysis .",
    "also , in the presence of inhomogeneous dielectric permittivity ( whose properties have attracted wide recent interest @xcite ) , ions are repelled from the low dielectric surfaces by their image charges , which is shown in particle simulations @xcite . when the seperation of surfaces becomes narrower , the repulsion becomes stronger , resulting in lower ionic concentration between the surfaces , and thus leading to an entropic driven attraction .",
    "the electrical field can also influence the solvent alignment and dielectric property , which is considered to be important for high ionic concentration or at the strong coupling region .",
    "this effect could be modelled through the langevin equation by taking into account the solvent polarization @xcite . recently",
    ", continuum theory with a set of self - consistent equations including fluctuation effects of ions has been used for effects of image charges on attractive forces between neutral plates @xcite .",
    "the self energy of mobile ions is used as a correction to the mean potential in the pb theory , leading to a more accurate approximation of the potential of mean force ( pmf ) in the boltzmann distribution , which consists of contributions from both the local ionic correlation and the ion - interface interaction energy .    though both particle simulations and self - consistent field theory have predicted the lca from depletion forces , it is less understood that what are effects of different material and salt properties such as surface charges , ionic valence and sizes .",
    "we study the interaction between plates in electrolytes from weak - coupling to a mediate - coupling regime by the self - consistent field model developed in @xcite which includes a modified treatment of the self energy .",
    "we present a systematic analysis of effects of the surface charge density , the bulk salt density , and salt species on the depletion - induced lca .",
    "it is shown that for symmetric electrolytes the interaction force between plates is repulsive if the surface charge density is high or if the salt concentration is low .",
    "the force becomes attractive at the opposite regimes , for which the strength will be stronger when the charge density is decreased or the salt density is increased .",
    "consider an equilibrium charged system with @xmath0 species of mobile ions in solution .",
    "given the pmf of the @xmath1th species , @xmath2 , the ion concentration can be determined by the boltzmann distribution , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the bulk concentration , and @xmath5 is the inverse thermal energy with @xmath6 the boltzmann constant and @xmath7 the absolute temperature .",
    "the pmf describes the free energy change by moving the ion from the bulk region into the current position , which is often determined by particle simulations or advanced theory in statistical physics .",
    "if the pmf is approximated by the mean potential energy @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being determined by the poisson equation , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the vacuum dielectric constant , @xmath12 is the relative permittivity of the media , and @xmath13 is the valence , we obtain the pb equation since @xmath14 is now an explicit function of @xmath9 . in the absence of dielectric inhomogeneity , the pb equation can be explained as a leading order approximation in terms of the coupling parameter @xmath15 @xcite , where @xmath16 is the counterion valence , @xmath17 is the bjerrum length of the solvent , and @xmath18 is the surface charge density . with the dielectric mismatch ,",

    "for such systems , we find the asymptotic expression works well . on the other hand ,",
    "the local born solvation energy can also be derived by assuming a gaussian distribution of charge on the test ion @xcite with the ionic size effect .",

    "the particle density becomes smaller , reducing the entropic effect .",

    "we can see the attraction occurs when the distance is at the scale of the debye length for the two denser cases , which is consistent with the simulation results @xcite .",
    "the pressure does not depend much on the asymmetry in surface charge densities , but the strength of the densities . by this observation , we will only study planes with the same @xmath81 in the following .    these results can be explained as that the pressure is resulted from the competition of the electrostatic repulsion and the entropically driven attraction @xcite , and the lca happens at the condition of smaller surface charge density for which the electrostatic repulsion is weak , or denser particle density for which the entropically driven attraction is strong .",

    "the pb theory is also not applicable for electrolytes with multivalent mobile ions .",
    "the inclusion of the ionic excluded volume and multivalent ions leads to a large change of the local correlation strength in self energy , and the consequence on the interface structure and interaction is not well investigated . in this section ,",
    "we perform simulations for two groups of asymmetric systems .",

    "the bulk charge density remains constants , @xmath105 and @xmath106 . the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ ex2 ] .",
    "the ionic size matters in two aspects : 1 ) the thickness of the helmholtz layer where ions are inaccessible ; and 2 ) the self energy . from fig .",
    "[ ex2](a ) , we observe strong effects on pressure curves due to the non - uniformity of counterions and coions . for symmetric ionic sizes ,",
    "the thickness of helmholtz layer is not that important as we can see that the curves of @xmath83 and @xmath107 are similar while the other two curves is totally different . for the effect of ionic size in self energy",
    ", we should recall the formulation of the effective self energy , the difference between @xmath35 and @xmath34 , @xmath108 multiplied by the factor @xmath109 .",
    "the leading contribution of @xmath38 is about @xmath110 plus boundary effect including the image charge .",
    "if the ion is not too close to the surface , @xmath38 is in general a negative quantity , with@xmath111 due to the ion depletion . as a result ,",
    "the self - energy contribution of a larger ion is less than that of a smaller ion , and hence the @xmath107 curve behaves a weaker attraction than the @xmath83 curve .",
    "if the ion size is very small which allows @xmath112 , then the image charge effect dominates in this area . the image charge effect becomes weaker as the ionic size gets larger , again ensuring a weaker attraction .    for asymmetric ionic sizes ,",
    "if counterions ( cations ) are bigger than coions ( anions ) , the helmholtz layer of counterions is thicker than coions. coions can be getting close to the charged surfaces , which effectively increases the density of the surface charge , thus the attractive force between interfaces is weakened or the interfaces become repulsive .",
    "this is shown by the curve of @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "in contrast , if coions are bigger , the surface charge density is effectively attenuated , leading to a stronger attraction potential ( see the curve of @xmath115 and @xmath116 ) . in this case",
    ", the planes of short separation remain attractive .",
    "let us look at the results in fig .",
    "[ ex2](b ) , the effects of valence asymmetry .",
    "since the self energy has quadratic relation with the valence , @xmath117 , while ion - surface electrostatic force is roughly proportional to @xmath13 , the multivalent counterion receives very strong repulsion from the surface .",
    "if coions have smaller valence , which cause less repulsion , equivalently the surface charge density is increased , thus the attractive force is weakened .",
    "the results have shown this situation : the planes in 2:1 electrolytes have weaker attraction ( becomes pure repulsion ) than those in 1:1 and 1:2 electrolytes .",
    "the attractive distance also increases as the debye length increases .",
    "the panels ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ ex2 ] present the total charge distribution along the normal direction of the interfaces for two separations @xmath118 and @xmath119 from panel ( b ) .",
    "it can be observed that the 2:-1 curves do show negative value near interfaces , validating the preceding analysis that the high - valence counterions increase the effective surface charge density .",
    "it should be mentioned that the 1:-2 curve in panel ( d ) is concave , different from the other three curves . near the middle point",
    ", the total charge reverses the sign , illustrating a charge inversion , another important electrostatic many - body phenomenon @xcite .",
    "again , it is owing to the strong repulsion of multivalent anions ( counterions ) by their image charge .",
    "we calculate the pressure between planes by varying the dielectric constant of the media outside the planes , @xmath50 , from 2.5 to 160 .",
    "the results given in fig .",
    "[ ex3](a ) illustrate a monotonic increase of the minimum pressure with @xmath50 .",
    "compared to the homogeneous permittivity @xmath120 , the low dielectric constant of the boundary media greatly enhances the lca .",
    "interestingly , the planes become always repulsive when @xmath50 is much larger than the water dielectric constant , e.g. , @xmath121 .",
    "this shows a counter - intuitive phenomenon that the conducting limit of the planes tends to be repulsive due to the entropic forces .    in fig .",
    "[ ex3](b ) , we show the comparison with a variable permittivity in water .",
    "since water molecule is polarizable , the dielectric permittivity of the water medium depends on the strength of the electrostatic field due to the orientation of dipole molecules against the field .",
    "a more ordered orientation leads to smaller permittivity , which can be described by the langevin model @xcite , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the langevin function , and @xmath124 is the permanent dipole moment . we take @xmath125 and @xmath126 . with the weak surface charge density ,",
    "the results show the electric field near the surfaces slightly increases the interface - interface pressure which is due to a stronger electrostatic interaction in lower dielectric permittivity .",
    "in summary , we study the phenomenon of the lca between charged planes from a recently - developed self - consistent field model . we investigate the influence of different parameters of the electrical double layer on the many - body phenomenon .",
    "it is shown the depletion - induced lca depends on the surface charge density and the bulk salt concentration , and the dielectric mismatch significantly changes the pressure strength between two planes .",
    "we find the mechanism of inducing lca is mostly the depletion effect between the charged surfaces .",
    "it is more likely to observe lca for low surface charge , high salt concentration and small surface dielectric permittivity .",
    "however , as the distance between charged surfaces which have lca is comparable with debye length , high salt concentration might lead to very narrow separation .",
