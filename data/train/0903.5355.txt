    "therefore , since the model did not fit the data in this case , the theory could not be used to extrapolate to other configurations .",
    "however , the gpi 4k - mems is specified to have 5 times more high - order stroke than the mems used in this experiment , which will further reduce stroke saturation .",
    "surprisingly , even the second attempt at prediction ( using a variable stroke cut - off for each particular spatial frequency ) did not match the experiments at the moderate to high spatial frequencies .",
    "this can be explained by looking again at fig .",
    "[ fig : spatfreq ] and seeing how stroke continues to fall off , albeit less steeply past the knee , no matter what spatial frequency is taken .",
    "if the stroke beyond a certain point were uniform , we would be in the ideal - influence - function regime for those spatial frequencies .",
    "the prediction , by using a single stroke value ( at each spatial frequency ) for the cut - off of the gaussian distribution , is still assuming uncorrelated narrow - sinc - function actuators , whereas on the mems there are always higher spatial frequencies that limit the stroke .",
    "in systems where saturation can not be tolerated , the wavefront correctors must have sufficient stroke to correct the amplitude of the phase aberrations .",
    "if deformable mirror stroke is limited , stroke can be conserved for dynamical corrections by instead using static correctors to remove inherent curvature to the dm itself and for correcting static aberrations in the optical path .",
    "similarly , the unpowered shape of the dm itself should be as flat as possible so as to conserve stroke for correcting turbulence .",
    "the stroke requirement increases with power in the kolmogorov spectrum , so better astronomical seeing conditions will give less saturation .",
    "accordingly , the astronomical site and observing conditions could be favorably selected to minimize stroke saturation .",
    "in designing a deformable mirror , factors that reduce stroke saturation include decreasing the thickness of the facesheet , increasing the spacing ( pitch ) between actuators , increasing the operating voltage , and modifying the mechanical design of the actuator ( varying parameters such as the capacitor gap , spring constant , flexural rigidity of the plate , or using leverage bending ) .",
    "these are varied primarily at the research and development phase .",
    "in this work we assume that piston and tip / tilt modes are corrected by other devices , and that the stroke of the woofer dm is high enough to correct the frequencies below the cutoff ; therefore , we are only concerned with avoiding saturation on the tweeter dm . in a dual - dm system , factors that reduce tweeter saturation via sending saturable stroke to a second low - order woofer dm include : employing a woofer with more actuators across the pupil ( the subject explored in this paper ) ; and carefully controlling the frequency distribution sent to each wavefront corrector in the control loop@xcite .    tweeter saturation occurrence can be predicted by analyzing simulations of correcting turbulence screens with model mems mirrors@xcite .",
    "our results show the analytic fitting - error model based on the turbulence power spectrum underpredicts incidence of stroke saturation .",
    "our original goal in this work was to measure whether stroke saturation would be problematic for gpi . in order to assure the higher - stroke mems mirrors ( now being fabricated ) are adequate for gpi",
    ", we plan to measure saturation statistics with similar testing on `` engineering - grade '' versions of the 4k - mems .",
    "in this experiment we applied kolmogorov - turbulence atmospheric phase screens to a mems deformable mirror .",
    "the r@xmath23 of the phase screens ranged from 1015 cm , and the pitch of the woofer used to remove the low spatial frequencies ranged from 816 actuators across an 8-m primary .",
    "the mems when solitary suffered saturation @xmath24% of the time . using a woofer dm reduces dramatically the amount of phase sent to the mems , and thus mitigated mems saturation occurrence to a fraction of a percent .",
    "the woofer did not mitigate mid - to - high - spatial - frequency stroke as much as expected .",
