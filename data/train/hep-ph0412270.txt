    "exotic pentaquark baryons has been a hot issue , since the leps collaboration  @xcite announced the new finding of the @xmath7 baryon @xmath8 which was soon confirmed by a number of other experiments @xcite , together with an observation of exotic @xmath9 states by the na49 experiment at cern  @xcite , though it is still under debate .",
    "those experiments searching for the pentaquark states was stimulated by diakonov et al .",
    "@xcite : masses and decay widths of exotic baryon antidecuplet were predicted within the chiral quark - soliton model .",
    "the discoveries of the pentaquark baryon @xmath1 and possibly of @xmath10 have triggered intensive theoretical investigations ( see , for example , refs.@xcite ) .",
    "the production mechanism of the @xmath1 has been discussed in refs.@xcite . in particular , it is of great interest to understand the photoproduction of the @xmath1 theoretically , since the leps and clas collaborations used photons as a probe to measure the @xmath1 . in order to describe the mechanism of the pentaquark photoproduction , we have to know the magnetic moment of the @xmath1 and its strong coupling constants .",
    "however , information on the static properties such as antidecuplet magnetic moments and their strong coupling constants is absent to date , so we need to estimate them theoretically .",
    "recently , two of the present authors calculated the magnetic moments of the exotic pentaquarks , within the framework of the chiral quark - soliton model  @xcite in the chiral limit .",
    "since we were not able to fix all the parameters for the magnetic moments in the chiral limit , we had to rely on the explicit model calculations  @xcite .",
    "a very recent work  @xcite extended the analysis for the magnetic moments of the baryons , taking into account the effect of su(3 ) symmetry breaking so that the necessary parameters are fixed by the magnetic moments of the baryon octet . in the present talk",
    ", we would like to present the main results of ref .",
    "the collective hamiltonian describing baryons in the su(3 ) chiral quark - soliton model takes the following form @xcite : @xmath11 with the symmetry breaking term given by:@xmath12 where parameters @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are of order @xmath16 and are given as functions of the @xmath17 sigma term  @xcite . @xmath18",
    "denote su(3 ) wigner rotation matrices and @xmath19 is a collective spin operator .",
    "the hamiltonian given in eq.([hsplit ] ) acts on the space of baryon wave functions : @xmath20 here , @xmath21 stands for the allowed irreducible representations of the su(3 ) flavor group , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the corresponding hypercharge , isospin , and its third component , respectively .",
    "right hypercharge @xmath24 is constrained to be unity for the physical spin states for which @xmath25 and @xmath26 are spin and its third component . the _ model - independent approach _ consists now in using eqs .",
    "( [ eq;1 ] ) and ( [ hsplit ] ) ( and/or possibly analogous equations for other observables ) and determining model parameters such as @xmath27 from experimental data",
    ".    the symmetry - breaking term ( [ hsplit ] ) of the collective hamiltonian mixes different su(3 ) representations as follows : @xcite@xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the state which reduces to the su(3 ) representation @xmath21 in the formal limit @xmath30 and the spin index @xmath26 has been suppressed .",
    "all relevant expressions for the mixing coefficients @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 can be found in ref .",
    "the collective operator for the magnetic moments can be parameterized by six constants by definition in the _ model - independent approach _",
    "they are treated as free  @xcite:@xmath34 the parameters @xmath35 are of order @xmath36 , while @xmath37 are of order @xmath16 , @xmath38 being regarded as a small parameter .",
    "the full expression for the magnetic moments can be decomposed as follows : @xmath39 where the @xmath40 is given by the matrix element of the @xmath41 between the purely symmetric states @xmath42 , and the @xmath43 is given as the matrix element of the @xmath44 between the symmetry states as well .",
    "the wave function correction @xmath45 is given as a sum of the interference matrix elements of the @xmath40 between purely symmetric states and admixtures displayed in eq.([admix ] ) .",
    "these matrix elements were calculated for octet and decuplet baryons in ref.@xcite .",
    "the measurement of the @xmath1 mass constrains the parameter space of the model .",
    "recent phenomenological analyzes indicate that our previous assumption on @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath46 , has to be most likely abandoned .",
    "therefore , our previous results for the magnetic moments of @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 have to be reanalyzed .",
    "now , we show that a _ model - independent _ analysis with this new phenomenological input yields @xmath50 much larger than initially assumed , which causes @xmath51 for realistic values of @xmath52 to be negative and rather small . our previous results for the decuplet magnetic moments turn out to hold within the accuracy of the model .",
    "the octet and decuplet magnetic moments were calculated in refs.@xcite . for the antidecuplet @xmath53 can be found in ref.@xcite . in order to calculate the @xmath45 , several off - diagonal matrix elements of the @xmath41 are required .",
    "these have been calculated in ref.@xcite in the context of the hadronic decay widths of the baryon antidecuplet .",
    "denoting the set of the model parameters by @xmath54 the model formulae for the set of the magnetic moments in representation @xmath21 ( of dimension @xmath55)@xmath56 can be conveniently cast into the form of the matrix equations:@xmath57\\cdot\\vec{w},%\\ ] ] where rectangular matrices @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 can be found in refs.@xcite .",

    "the values of the @xmath67 $ ] are independent of @xmath52 .    similarly , the value of the nucleon strange magnetic moment is independent of @xmath52 and reads @xmath68 in fair agreement with our previous analysis of ref.@xcite .",
    "parameters @xmath69 , however , do depend on @xmath52 .",
