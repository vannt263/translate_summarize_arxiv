    "global fits of theory to large amounts of experimental data are rather important to current elementary particle phenomenology @xcite .",
    "a substantial amount of work has been done to estimate the errors on these fits @xcite , and it is now of obvious importance to test whether the fits obtained are actually good .",
    "is the theory correct ? or is an extension to the standard model needed ?",
    "are the experiments correct ?",
    "the simplest requirement for a good fit is that the overall @xmath0 indicates a good fit according to the hypothesis - testing criterion , which allows a range @xmath1 in the value of @xmath0 ( where @xmath2 is the number of degrees of freedom ) .",
    "in fact , as we will show , this criterion is far from optimal .",
    "for example , a small subset of the data may be quite badly fit , but the contribution of that subset to the overall @xmath0 may nevertheless be too small for it to show up significantly .    in this paper we propose a new criterion for goodness of fit . not only should the overall @xmath0 be good , but the fits to individual experiments in the data set or to subsets of the data should also be good in a particular and quite stringent manner .",
    "this leads to a `` parameter - fitting '' criterion that goes beyond the traditional `` hypothesis - testing '' criterion .     vs.  parameter @xmath3 in fitting of theory to data with @xmath4 points .",
    "]    our criterion is motivated by the following paradox @xcite , the `` paradox of parameter determination and hypothesis testing '' which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting ] .",
    "if one has a theoretical prediction for an experiment with @xmath2 data points , then a good fit should have @xmath0 approximately in the range @xmath5 , which is the one - standard - deviation range for @xmath0 when the experiment is repeated many times .",
    "let us call this the _ hypothesis - testing _ criterion . on the other hand ,",
    "if the theory has a parameter @xmath3 that is fitted from the data , then the one - standard - deviation error on that parameter is given by a deviation of @xmath6 by one unit from its minimum .",
    "let us call this the _ parameter - fitting _ criterion .",
    "now observe that if @xmath3 is varied so as to give a deviation of @xmath7 of @xmath6 from its minimum , it produces a large deviation of @xmath8 standard deviations from the best fit .",
    "should be replaced by the number of degrees of freedom , which in this case is @xmath9 .",
    "but for the case of interest , this is irrelevant , since @xmath2 is large . ]",
    "the paradox is that a particular value of @xmath3 , such as @xmath10 , can thus simultaneously provide a good fit according to the hypothesis - testing criterion and a bad fit according to the parameter - fitting criterion .",
    "the paradox is resolved by examining what happens if the experiment is repeated  see fig .",
    "[ fig : repeat ] . the curves for @xmath6",
    "fluctuate vertically by a typical amount @xmath7 , but horizontally only by a typical amount corresponding to a one - standard - deviation variation in the parameter .",
    "if one only knows the predictions of the theory for one particular value of @xmath3 , then only the weaker hypothesis - testing criterion ( @xmath0 in the range @xmath5 ) can be used .",
    "but if more information is available , namely the predictions of the theory for any value of @xmath3 , then the shape of the @xmath6 curve can be used , and hence a more stringent criterion for goodness of fit is available .     when the experiment of fig .",
    "[ fig : fitting ] is repeated . ]    in order to test the goodness of fit to a set of experimental data , one should obviously examine not only the overall total @xmath0 , but also the @xmath0 for suitable subsets of data .",
    "our aim in this paper is to find the most stringent criterion for doing this .",
    "first , we will introduce the key idea by means of a simple example , and we will show that the appropriate criterion is a version of the parameter - fitting criterion rather than the weaker hypothesis - testing criterion",
    ". then we will generalize the resulting criterion to a full multi - parameter and multi - experiment situation .",
    "finally we will present a convenient method for showing the results in one - dimensional plots when there are many theoretical parameters , and examine those plots for a typical application that is of current interest .",
    "in addition to the standard concepts of statistical and systematic errors , we find it useful to introduce the concept of a _ bug : _ an unforeseen error that is not taken into account in the determination of the systematic errors , and for which the probability distribution is highly non - gaussian . a bug in a computer program used in the experiment or in the theory calculation is a canonical example .",
    "but we also find it useful to consider an error in the theory itself as a bug : an error in the lagrangian instead of in hardware or software .",
    "an error in the theory is otherwise known as new physics .",
    "an actually incorrect experiment is also an example of a bug .",
    "the reason for explicitly introducing the concept of a bug is to suitably describe what happens when there is an extremely bad fit between theory and experiment .",
    "in this situation , our usual experience is not that an extremely improbable fluctuation has occurred in the normal statistical and systematic effects , but that something has happened that was nt allowed for in the estimation of the errors , i.e. , a bug has occurred .",
    "the observed distribution of errors found in a study of actual experiments in particle physics does not in fact follow a gaussian form @xcite .",
    "although the peak of the distribution is that of the expected gaussian  showing that experimentalists typically estimated their one - standard - deviation errors correctly  there is a substantial non - gaussian tail that one could associate , at least in part , with the bugs mentioned above .",
    "we see at least two ways to formulate these ideas in terms of a statistical analysis .",
    "the first is simply to formulate an appropriate criterion for recognizing when a fit is bad .",
    "that is the primary issue addressed in this paper .",
    "a second approach , discussed in a separate paper@xcite , is to modify the normal formula for @xmath0 to take into account the non - gaussian tails of error distributions .",
    "this improves the estimation of parameter values by allowing the fitting procedure to effectively disregard data points that are badly fit by the combination of theory and the other experiments .",
    "such an analysis can also be used in a suitably bayesian sense to deduce the probability of a bug , if the non - gaussian tails are identified with the effects of bugs .",
    "we will explain our ideas in their simplest context , by presenting a hypothetical situation involving the comparison of a theory to two experiments .",
    "consider two experiments , which we will call the tev experiment and the hera experiment . let the relevant theory be given by standard perturbative qcd calculations with particular sets of parton densities , cteq and mrst , which have been fit to other data .",
    "although the numbers we give are completely hypothetical , we use names representing actual experiments and actual parton densities in order to show vividly that we intend our ideas on statistical methods to be applied to important practical cases .",
    ".hypothetical values of @xmath0 for comparison between theory , using two different sets of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , and two sets of experimental data .",
    "[ cols=\">,^,^,^ \" , ]     what to do about this situation  other than the long - term option of waiting for the discrepancies to be resolved by improvements in theory or experiment  remains an open question . in order to obtain provisional results in the interim , ref .",
    "@xcite advocated estimating the uncertainty of predictions based on the global fit as those contained in the region @xmath11 , where @xmath12 was chosen in order to assume a range of uncertainty for the predictions of the global fit that is somewhat broader than the variations of the experiments going into it , which are indicated in table  [ table : cteq ] .",
    "of course , any estimate of the uncertainties based on an inconsistent fit will necessarily be somewhat model - dependent .",
    "there is reason to hope that at least one discrepancy will be resolved in the near future by new experimental data .",
    "that is between data sets @xmath13 and @xmath14 , which correspond to data on @xmath15 from the two major hera experiments h1 and zeus .",
    "these are similar physical measurements made by similar techniques , and yet we find that improving the fit to either of these two experiments ( by emphasizing it in the fit with an appropriate lagrange factor @xmath16 ) makes the fit to the other experiment get worse .",
    "this suggests that the problem is an experimental error that may be resolved in the new data that is expected soon from these groups .",
    "the largest values of the inconsistency parameter @xmath17 in table [ table : cteq ] are produced by data sets @xmath18 and @xmath19 , which are data from muon scattering on deuterium and neutrino scattering on a nuclear target .",
    "one may speculate that the problems are caused by inaccurate treatment of nuclear binding effects in these experiments , although the discrepancy associated with the @xmath20 data is not much worse that associated with the @xmath21 data measured by the same group .    _",
    "one should be cautious in interpreting the value of @xmath17 as a definite number of standard deviations , since the interpretation derived in appendix [ sec : one.param.model ] assumes that only one effective parameter is determined by a particular experiment .",
    "_    for the inconsistency to be a real effect , it should be confirmable in another global fit . that this is the case for the mrst fit can be seen in fig .  21 of @xcite .",
    "there @xmath0 is plotted as a function of @xmath22 for several experiments .",
    "the ccfr @xmath15 and the bcdms @xmath23 are clearly very inconsistent with the mrst fit , in agreement with our results .",
    "we also find a strong inconsistency with the bcdms @xmath24 data , but that data does not appear in the mrst plot .",
    "( solid curves ) and @xmath25 for experiments 14 . ]",
    "( solid curves ) and @xmath25 for experiments 58 . ]",
    "the effective one - dimensional model of appendix  [ sec : one.param.model ] suggests a new type of plot in which the various @xmath0 contributions are shown as a function of the lagrange multiplier parameter . in doing this ,",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath26 .",
    "this makes the function being minimized become @xmath27 , which is more symmetric with respect to @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "results from the 8 experiments discussed previously are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : fit301234 ] and [ fig : fit305678 ] .",
    "the fits using the one - dimensional ( 2 parameter ) model are quite good , which lends confidence to the results from that model that are shown in table [ table : cteq ] .",
    "this fitting can be thought of as finding the single parameter ( a non - linear combination of the fit parameters ) that each experiment is most sensitive to in disagreement with the other experiments .",
    "a common problem with global fits is that if there is a bad fit to a particular experiment with few data points , its contribution to the total @xmath0 may be completely negligible according to the hypothesis - testing criterion .",
    "the bad fit to a few data points will not be noticeable in the goodness of fit as measured by the overall @xmath0 .",
    "our new criterion applies a parameter - fitting criterion to individual experiments , and hence can recognize when a bad fit to a single experiment is significant , even if that experiment has too few data points to make a big effect on the total @xmath0 .",
    "a bad fit is detected if the experiment strongly determines any particular combination of parameters , and that determination is incompatible with the value determined by the other experiments .    in simple cases where there is only one parameter to measure , such as the mass of a particle , every one of a group of experiments",
    "can separately measure the parameter .",
    "consistency between the experiments is just a matter of whether the measured values agree within errors .",
    "of course , the new criterion proposed in this paper reproduces that result ; but the extra complication it introduces is totally unnecessary for that situation .    the new criterion becomes important when there are many parameters to determine , but each experiment determines only a few combinations of them .",
    "questions of consistency can then only be addressed after a global fit has been performed to determine all of the parameters .",
    "the more elaborate methods that we propose then become essential to optimally test consistency .",
    "our criterion can be expressed in an especially simple form whenever the dependence of the individual @xmath30 can be approximated by a quadratic function of the effective parameters , as is shown in appendix [ sec : one.param.model ] for a single effective parameter , and in appendix [ sec : quad.approx ] for an arbitrary number of parameters .",
    "we have demonstrated how our criterion works when applied to an actual case of current interest , the global fit to determine parton densities .",

    "in this appendix , we derive the relationship between @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the simple case that experiment @xmath32 determines just one combination of the fit parameters , and the dependence on that parameter can be approximated by a quadratic function in the region of @xmath31 that is of interest .",
    "we will show that in this case , a well - defined shape is predicted for the graphs of @xmath30 vs.  @xmath31 , or @xmath30 vs.  @xmath33 .",
    "this shape is defined by two parameters ; and the degree of consistency between experiment @xmath32 and the other experiments is given directly by one of those parameters . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cteq5app ] , we found this shape to provide a good approximation for the study of fits of parton densities .",
    "since we are treating the case that experiment @xmath32 determines a single combination of parameters , we can define a transformation of the parameters , so that only a single parameter @xmath3 is relevant , and @xmath34 where the argument @xmath35 denotes values at the minimum of @xmath31 as before .",
    "the method of transforming @xmath36 and @xmath37 to this form follows from the argument given in appendix [ sec : quad.approx ] .",
    "there should be an extra term in @xmath36 quadratic in the other parameters , but for our calculation this extra term is always set to its minimum value , and hence can be ignored . solving for the dependence of @xmath30 on @xmath31 leads to @xmath38    to interpret the two parameters @xmath39 and @xmath40 of this model , it is convenient to express them as @xmath41 rescaling the fit parameter by @xmath42 then leads to @xmath43 it is easy to read off from these formulae that experiment @xmath32 can be interpreted according to gaussian statistics as a measurement of @xmath44 with result @xmath45 while all of the other experiments combined give a result @xmath46 if we combine the errors in quadrature , these two results are seen to differ by @xmath47 hence the two measurements differ by @xmath48 standard deviations .",
    "they are therefore consistent with each other if and only if @xmath49 , if a gaussian distribution of errors is assumed .",
    "meanwhile , the parameter @xmath50 describes how effective experiment @xmath32 is at measuring the parameter @xmath44 , compared to the combined effectiveness of the other experiments .",
    "the relation between @xmath37 and @xmath51 in this model can be obtained explicitly by eliminating @xmath44 between eqs .",
    "( [ eq : delchi1sq ] ) and ( [ eq : delchi2sq ] ) .",
    "the result is a parabolic curve which is seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : fit30a ] and [ fig : fit30b ] : @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this form holds in the region between the minimum of @xmath55 at @xmath56 and the minimum of @xmath51 at @xmath57 . outside that region ,",
    "the curves do not exist .    in a more general example , with more parameters , but where each experiment only determines some of the parameters , the curves are no longer exactly of the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : i.noti ] ) .",
    "this can happen both because there are more parameters and because the quadratic approximation for the @xmath0 functions may break down , particularly far from the global minimum of @xmath31 .",
    "this presumably accounts for the almost straight line behavior of the tails of some of the curves in fig.[fig : fit30b ] .",
    "it is instructive to assume that the various contributions @xmath30 which make up @xmath31 can be approximated by quadratic functions of the original fit parameters @xmath58 in the region of parameter space that is allowed by the hypothesis - testing criterion for @xmath31 .",
    "this quadratic approximation has been found to be reasonably accurate in the case of parton density fitting @xcite ; and in any case it can provide a semi - quantitative guide to the kinds of behavior to be expected .",
    "the first derivatives of @xmath31 vanish at its minimum , so in the quadratic approximation @xmath59 the real symmetric matrix @xmath60 has a complete orthonormal set of eigenvectors @xmath61 : @xmath62 introducing new coordinates @xmath63 by @xmath64 leads to a simple diagonal expression : @xmath65    the fit to a particular experiment , which we refer to here as experiment @xmath66 , is measured by @xmath67 . since we assume that it is a quadratic function of @xmath58 , it is also a quadratic function of @xmath63 : @xmath68 using arguments similar to the above , the real symmetric matrix @xmath69 has a complete set of orthonormal eigenvectors @xmath70 : @xmath71 introducing new coordinates @xmath72 , this time without a change in scale , by @xmath73 creates a diagonal form for @xmath74 while preserving the very simple form for @xmath75 : @xmath76 where @xmath77 .",
    "this result is identical to the form that was _ assumed _ in appendix  [ sec : one.param.model ] , except that there is a sum of independent quadratic contributions in place of just a single one .",
    "the relation between @xmath67 and @xmath31 under the quadratic assumption is easily found by choosing the parameters @xmath72 so as to minimize @xmath78 the result is @xmath79 substituting ( [ eq : apppsubi ] ) into ( [ eq : appdelchitot])([eq : appdelchi1 ] ) relates @xmath67 and @xmath31 parametrically via the lagrange multiplier parameter @xmath80 .",
