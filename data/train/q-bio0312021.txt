    "the rapidly expanding field of network analysis , reviewed in @xcite , has provided examples of networks exhibiting  accelerating \" network growth , where link number grows faster than linearly with network size . for instance , the internet @xcite appears to grow by adding links more quickly than sites though the relative change over time is small and the internet appears to remain scale free and well characterized by stationary statistics @xcite .",
    "similarly , the number of links per substrate in the metabolic networks of organisms appears to increase linearly with substrate number @xcite , the average number of links per scientist in collaboration networks increases linearly over time @xcite , and languages appear to evolve via accelerated growth @xcite .    in the main , the chief focus of these studies has been on locating parameter regimes allowing accelerating networks to maintain scale free statistics and thereby to allow continued unconstrained growth .",
    "for example , an early study considered a growing network receiving @xmath0 new links for @xmath1 when the network size is at @xmath2 nodes , but restricted analysis to the case @xmath3 as  obviously , @xmath4 can not exceed 1 ( the total number of links has to be smaller than @xmath5 since one may forbid multiple links ) . \" and  the density of connections in real networks remains rather low all the time , so one may reasonably assume that @xmath4 is small .",
    "equivalent limits were considered in ref .",
    "@xcite . in such restricted parameter regimes networks",
    "could maintain scale free statistics , though this result carries the implicit but unexamined finding that alternate parameter regimes permit transitions from stationary to nonstationary statistics .",
    "this paper builds on these implicit findings .",
    "accelerating networks are more prevalent and important in society and in biology than is commonly realized  see the survey in ref . @xcite .",
    "in fact , any network that requires functional integration and organization ( where the activity of any given node is dependent on the state of the network or different subnetworks ) is by definition an accelerating network , that is , as the network expands , the proportion of the network devoted to control and regulation expands disproportionately .",
    "this in turn means that all such networks , sooner or later , must be limited in their size and complexity , which limitations can only be breached by changing either the physical nature of the control architecture ( a state transition ) or by reducing the functional integration . in the latter case , where networks are hitting a complexity limit ,",
    "further growth in network size will likely display structural transitions from randomly connected , to scale free statistics , to densely connected and perhaps finally to fully connected statistics .",
    "should such networks be unable to successfully complete these transitions for any reason , then it is likely that network growth must cease entirely or that either a transition to a nonaccelerating structure is required to permit further growth or novel technologies must appear allowing the continuation of accelerated growth .",
    "exemplar accelerating networks displaying such size limits or structural transitions include ( a ) all forms of economic markets where the latest price offered by any participant instantly affects all other participants , ( b ) industrial companies and sectors implementing a just - in - time business model where any worker can halt the entire production system , ( c ) error propagation networks linking an error source with all affected nodes as studied in software analysis and in models of the propagation of diseases , bushfires , cracks , and electricity grid failures , ( d ) in any dynamical system dependent on relative quantities so changes in one node instantly affects every other node such as relative transcription factor binding probabilities or relative evolutionary fitness , ( e ) in computer hardware and in cluster and grid supercomputer networks , and ( f ) in organizational networks @xcite .",
    "in fact , it is well understood that social networks only take on small world statistics when the network is large enough  in small towns everyone one knows everyone else so social networks are accelerating , and social networks make a transition to small world statistics only as individual nodes saturate their connectivity limits @xcite .",
    "similar observations can be made about the scale free internet and world wide web  when sufficiently small , these networks were likely accelerating until connectivity capacities saturated forcing a transition to scale free structures to permit further growth @xcite .",
    "this paper develops an accelerating network model of prokaryotic ( single celled ) gene regulatory networks to investigate size and complexity limits inherent in the adoption of an accelerating architecture . because our focus is on structural transitions",
    ", we explicitly do not need to restrict the degree of acceleration to low values of @xmath6 .",
    "rather , we permit this parameter to take on any value including @xmath7 and ensure that the network is not saturated by making link formation probabilistic .",
    "the resulting novel  probabilistic \" accelerating networks grow by adding on average @xmath8 new links with @xmath1 and otherwise arbitrary provided the probability of adding a link is suitably constrained @xmath9 so that total link number remains less than of order @xmath10 .",
    "the gene regulatory model presented here is motivated by comparative genomics findings that the total number of regulatory proteins controlling gene expression ( links ) scales quadratically with the number of genes or operons ( nodes ) in prokaryotes @xcite .",
    "this quadratic growth results as the number of links made by a regulator exploiting homology dependent ( sequence specific ) interactions scales proportionally to the number of randomly drifting promotor sequences or effectively , with gene number @xcite .",
    "hence , gene regulatory networks are inherently accelerating  the probable number of links per regulator @xmath8 increases linearly with node number with @xmath11 , so consequently , the total number of links scales quadratically as @xmath12 . in small and sparsely connected networks , most links come from different regulators suggesting that regulator number also scales quadratically with gene number , @xmath12 . such an accelerating network would be characterized initially by sparse connectivity at low gene numbers and subsequently by denser connectivity at high gene numbers as networks attempt a transition to a densely connected regime . if the evolving networks can successfully make this transition , the evolutionary record will display a transition in network statistics for some critical network size @xmath13 .",
    "conversely , if these networks , optimized by evolution in the sparse regime , are unable to make the transition to the densely connected regime , the evolutionary record would show a strict size limit @xmath14 at some critical network size .",
    "but this is exactly what is observed .",
    "all prokaryotic gene numbers and genomes are indeed of restricted size ( less than about 10,000 genes with genomes of between 0.5 and 10 megabases @xcite ) , in contrast to the genomes of multicellular eukaryotes ( with for humans , about 30,000 genes and a genome of about 3 gigabases @xcite ) . ref .",
    "@xcite predicted the size limit @xmath15 genes as continued genome growth requires the number of new regulators to exceed the number of nonregulatory nodes .",
    "a satisfactory model of prokaryotic gene regulatory networks requires some novel features .",
    "as mentioned above , we introduce probabilistic link formation to allow rapid accelerated growth and correspondingly stricter size limits .",
    "( a different but related mechanism was introduced in refs . @xcite which considered the effects of stochastic fluctuations in the number of added links with each additional node . ) in addition , we employ directed links and partition nodes into two classes where  regulators \" can source outbound regulatory links to regulate other nodes ( both regulators and non - regulators ) , while  non - regulators \" can not source outbound links .",
    "@xcite has previously considered networks of distinguishable nodes . )",
    "further , experimental evidence presented below indicates that the distribution of inbound links is compact and exponential while the distribution of outbound links is long - tailed and likely scale - free . as a result",

    "prokaryotes typically group their dna encoded genes in operons , co - regulated functional modules of average size 1.70 genes each in _ e. coli _ which value we treat as typical though in reality , operon size decreases slightly with genome size @xcite .",
    "each operon can be either unregulated and so constitutively or stochastically expressed or subject to combinatoric regulation by multiple regulatory protein transcription factors binding to each operon s promotor sequence .    again assuming that _ e. coli _ is typical , any given regulatory protein affects an average of about 5 operons with this distribution being long tailed @xcite so the majority of regulators affect only one operon though some regulators ( crp ) can affect up to 71 operons or 133 genes @xcite .",
    "( this latter reference estimated that each regulator controls on average 3 genes . )",
    "more recent estimates have the transcription factor crp , a global sensor of food levels in the environment , regulating up to 197 genes directly and a further 113 genes indirectly via 18 other transcription factors @xcite .",
    "( to observe the long tailed distribution , see fig . 2 of ref . @xcite and fig .",
    "@xcite . )",
    "however , the number of inputs taken by an operon is characterized by a compact exponential distribution with a rapidly decaying tail so the majority of regulated operons are controlled by a single regulator while very few regulated operons are controlled by four , five , six or seven regulators @xcite .",
    "in particular , ref .",
    "@xcite examined 500 regulatory links from about 100 regulators to almost 300 operons to estimate that each regulated operon takes on average 2 inputs though fig .",
    "2 of this reference suggests an average input number of about 1.5 .",

    "@xcite estimates that 327 regulated operons receive 524 links giving an average input number of 1.6 .",
    "we extend the gene network model of ref . @xcite to construct an accelerating network model of prokaryote regulatory gene networks .",
    "prokaryotes typically pack their @xmath17 genes into a lesser number of @xmath24 co - regulated operons where we assume that operons contain exactly @xmath25 genes .",
    "of the existing operons , @xmath26 are regulated operons and @xmath27 are unregulated operons . of the total number of operons ,",
    "there are @xmath16 regulatory operons whose regulatory interactions are directed links from regulatory operons to regulated operons . under the assumption that there is only one regulatory gene per regulatory operon , the observed quadratic relation of eq .",
    "[ eq_croft_results ] becomes @xmath28 when regulators and regulatory links are very rare , i.e. when genomes are small , it is likely that every new link is associated with a new regulator so the number of links varies roughly quadratically with operon number .",
    "we write @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the probability of forming a particular beneficial link per operon .",
    "the value for @xmath30 will be approximately @xmath31 , but the exact relation must be derived from the details of the implemented model .    each regulatory link between nodes",
    "is directed , and characterized by two distinct distributions describing respectively the placement of the heads and tails of each link . only a relatively few nodes are regulatory , and of these",
    ", the number of outbound link tails per regulatory node are described by a size dependent long - tailed distribution with average about @xmath32 .",
    "such a long - tailed distribution requires that link tails be preferentially attached to an existing regulatory operon or equivalently , the associated regulated operon must possess one promotor binding site ( among others ) that binds that particular regulator .",
    "consequently , the preferential selection of regulators means that the promotor sequences of newly regulated nodes can not be randomly chosen  randomly drifting promotor sequences would be as likely to match any one regulator as another .",
    "a plausible physical explanation for the preferential attachment of link tails to existing regulators is that newly fixated operons come largely from gene duplication events @xcite where some of the duplicated promotor binding sites are under strong selective constraint while other binding sites and the operon genes can drift freely .",
    "gene duplication then implies that in a genome of size @xmath2 operons , if some regulator @xmath33 has @xmath34 outbound regulatory links to approximately @xmath34 regulated operons , then the probability that a newly fixated operon is also regulated by @xmath33 is simply the proportion of such regulated operons in the genome , or @xmath35 .",
    "this implements the required preferential attachment as the resulting rate of growth in the number of links attached to node @xmath33 is also then proportional to @xmath34 .",
    "if there is also some probability of the appearance of novel promotor sequences , these combined processes suffice to produce the observed scale free distributions .",
    "this model is roughly consistent with recent estimates of the relative contributions to prokaryote genome growth which suggest that horizontal gene transfer rates @xmath36 are roughly one third of gene loss rates @xmath37 and roughly one half of vertical inheritance or gene genesis rates @xmath38 leading to roughly constant sized genomes over long times ( as @xmath39 ) , while  it is remarkable that phylogenetic distributions of at least 60% [ and up to 75% ] of protein families can be explained merely by vertical inheritance .",
    "similarly , three quarters of examined transcription factors in ref .",
    "@xcite were two - domain proteins with shared domain architectures leading to the estimate that about 75% of transcription factors have arisen as a consequence of gene duplication ( though the joint duplication of regulatory regions and of regulated genes or of transcription factors together with regulated genes is more rare ) .",
    "a further implication of these gene duplication processes is that , in the main , regulators can only appear on entry to the genome  a potential regulator lacking any target matches in a given genome will never form any links when most operons arise from promotor preserving duplication events .",
    "this allows us to considerably simplify our model , and hereafter , we only allow regulators to appear on their entry to the genome . of course , more realistic but considerably more complicated models are possible .",
    "in contrast to the relatively small number of regulatory nodes , all nodes can themselves be regulated by inbound links and in fact , can be multiply regulated as promotor regions can contain more than one binding site .",
    "further , the many used and unused promotor region binding sites broadly sample the space of possible binding sites so only a small fraction of nodes will be regulated by any one regulator . as a result",

    "the filled points on the outer circle locate regulators and have radius indicating the number of outbound regulatory links .",
    "the open points on the middle circle locate regulated operons and have radius indicating the number of inbound regulatory inputs .",
    "the arrows in the inner circle show all directed regulatory links . _ ]    we suppose that the operon network grows by the sequential addition of numbered nodes @xmath41 for @xmath42 , and that at network size @xmath43 , node @xmath44 ( @xmath45 ) has @xmath46 outbound tails and @xmath47 inbound heads .",
    "we do not model the many trials of potential genes over many generations and merely include fixated genes in our count  that is , drifting sequence is not counted as part of the fixated genome .",
    "this further implies the sequence of established nodes is under severe selective constraint and unable to drift so consequently new links can not be added between existing nodes .",
    "( if a proportion @xmath48 of existing nodes can explore novel sequence space in time @xmath49 , then the number of new regulators increases as @xmath50 , and as @xmath2 is itself a function of time , this integrates to generate a non - quadratic relation between regulator and operon number which is not observed . )    for clarity , fig .",
    "[ f_e_coli_network ] preempts later calculations and depicts a statistically generated version of an _ e. coli _ genome where nodes are placed sequentially counterclockwise in a circle ( for convenience only ) .",
    "alternative genome models may be distinguished by the age distribution of regulators , regulated operons and their link numbers , and these are indicated in this figure .",
    "in particular , fig .",
    "[ f_e_coli_network ] shows a highly nonuniform distribution of regulators and outbound link numbers with gene age in contrast to a uniform distribution of regulated operons and of inbound link numbers .",
    "( it will turn out that these latter age - independent distribution are only present when regulator number grows quadratically with genome size . )",
    "these distributions result from the physical processes underlying the formation of regulatory links in prokaryotes .",
    "as discussed above , a substantial proportion of the gene regulation network of prokaryotes is enacted via homology dependent interactions as when sequence specified protein transcription factors bind to specific promoter sequences .",
    "the undirected nature of evolutionary searches means that gene regulatory networks fundamentally exploit the same sequence matching algorithms used in comparative genetics where the probability of obtaining matches between a single given trial sequence of some small fixed length and an entire genome scales proportionately to genome length ",
    "doubling genome length doubles the probability of a match .",
    "hence , the expected number of links formed per regulator scales linearly with present genome size . as the number of source trial sequences also scales with genome length , the expected number of matches between all regulators and all regulated operons scales quadratically with genome length , or effectively , with operon number assuming constant sized operons over the evolutionary record .    as a consequence , on entry into the genome , each new gene has some probability of being a regulator dependent firstly on its suitability to bind dna and secondly on the linearly increasing expected number of acceptable binding targets present in the genome on entry ( or at later times ) . as discussed above",
    ", the predominance of vertical gene genesis events allows a simplified model wherein the probability of a new node being regulatory is determined solely by the number of available links present at the time of entry .",
    "we assume then that on entry into the genome each new node @xmath41 can form @xmath51 links with nodes @xmath52 consisting of a single self - regulatory link from node @xmath41 to itself with probability @xmath30 , @xmath53 regulatory outbound links to the existing nodes each with equal probability @xmath30 , and , provided that sufficient regulators already exist , @xmath54 inbound regulatory links from some subset of the existing regulators chosen according to preferential attachment .",
    "( for consistency , we can only add @xmath55 distinct regulatory links to node @xmath41 provided there are at least this many regulators in existence .",

    "<S> networks exhibiting  accelerating \" growth have total link numbers growing faster than linearly with network size and can exhibit transitions from stationary to nonstationary statistics and from random to scale - free to regular statistics at particular critical network sizes . </S>",
    "<S> however , if for any reason the network can not tolerate such gross structural changes then accelerating networks are constrained to have sizes below some critical value . </S>",
    "<S> this is of interest as the regulatory gene networks of single celled prokaryotes are characterized by an accelerating quadratic growth and are size constrained to be less than about 10,000 genes encoded in dna sequence of less than about 10 megabases . </S>",
    "<S> this paper presents a probabilistic accelerating network model for prokaryotic gene regulation which closely matches observed statistics by employing two classes of network nodes ( regulatory and non - regulatory ) and directed links whose inbound heads are exponentially distributed over all nodes and whose outbound tails are preferentially attached to regulatory nodes and described by a scale free distribution . </S>",
    "<S> this model explains the observed quadratic growth in regulator number with gene number and predicts an upper prokaryote size limit closely approximating the observed value . </S>"
