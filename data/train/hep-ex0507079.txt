    "chief among these is the ability to do an _ unbinned _ analysis , in which the event times of individual neutrino events are used as inputs to a maximum likelihood fit .",
    "this paper presents results from an unbinned maximum likelihood analysis and a more traditional lomb - scargle periodogram analysis for sno s pure d@xmath2o and salt phase data sets .",
    "previous analyses of data from other experiments have used the lomb - scargle periodogram  @xcite and binned maximum likelihood techniques to search for periodicities in the solar neutrino data .",

    "deadtime incurred within a run , mostly due to spallation cuts that remove events occurring within 20 seconds after a muon , can be neglected , since such deadtime is incurred randomly at average intervals much shorter than the periods of interest for this analysis .",

    "the source of these 11 bursts is not certain , but they may have been produced by atmospheric neutrino interactions . for this analysis a similar cut removing any event occurring within 150  ms of another event",
