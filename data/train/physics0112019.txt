    "<S> * abstract *    in this paper , we have investigated the correlated electron emission of the nonsequence double ionization ( nsdi ) in an intense linearly polarized field . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical model we employed is the semiclassical rescattering model , the model atom we used is the helium . </S>",
    "<S> we find a significant correlation between magnitude and direction of the momentum of two emission electrons , and give a good explanation for this striking phenomenon by observing the classical collisional trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that this correlation phenomenon is universal in nsdi process , as revealed by the recent experiment on the argon .    </S>",
    "<S> the excessive double ionization observed in helium experiments @xcite draws much attention to the multiple - electron dynamics in the laser - atom interaction . in these experiments the single ionization of he in a linearly polarized field </S>",
    "<S> is accurately predicted by the single active electron ( sae ) approximation @xcite , well described by the ammosov - delone - krainov ( adk ) tunnelling theory @xcite . however , the case of double ionization is more complicated . in the regime of very high intensities ( @xmath0w/@xmath1 ) where strong double </S>",
    "<S> ionization occurs , the double ionization keeps in good agreement with the sequential sae models as that in the lower intensities regime(@xmath2w/@xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the double ionization deviates seriously from the sequential sae model and shows a great enhancement in a `` knee '' regime @xmath3@xmath4w/@xmath5 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> this surprising large yields of the double ionization obviously indicates that the sequential ionization is no longer the dominating process in this regime and the electron - electron correlation has to be taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> intense efforts to model the two - electron process of the double ionization in a laser field have reproduced the main feature of the knee structure in the double ionization yield as a function of laser peak intensity and , moreover , yielded quantitative agreement with the experiments in some cases @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the physical mechanism behind this nonsequential process is , however , still debatable . </S>",
    "<S> both the `` shake - off '' model and the `` recollision '' model are suggested to describe the electron s correlation @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , none of the two nonsequence double ionization ( nsdi ) mechanisms can completely explain the experimental observations . </S>",
    "<S> for the `` shake - off '' model , it can not give the reason for the decrease in the double ionization yields as the polarization of the laser field departs from linear @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in the `` recollision '' model , the returning electrons are known to have a maximum classical kinetic energy of @xmath6 @xmath7 , so one can determine a minimum intensity required for the rescattering electron to have enough energy to excite the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> but the double ionization yields observed in experiments has no such an intensity threshold . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the double ionization process is rather complicated and subtle , both of the two nsdi processes and the sequential ionization have contributions to it and may dominate in the different regimes . </S>",
    "<S> in another aspect , becker and faisal proposed a `` correlated energy sharing '' model to describe the nsdi processes and nuclei recoil experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the model is based on the so - called intense - field many - body s - matrix theory derived by a rearrangement of the usual s - matrix series and include time electron correlation and the rescattering mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> we have employed the semiclassical model to study the double ionization of helium in intense linearly polarized field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reproduced the excessive double ionization and the photoelectron spectra observed experimentally both quantitatively and qualitively , and we argue that the classical collisional trajectories is the main source of the nonsequence double ionization of helium in the `` knee '' regime .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , the observation of the correlated electron emission in laser - induced double ionization of argon @xcite provided new insights into the nsdi process . </S>",
    "<S> these authors reported a strong correlation between the direction and the magnitude of the momenta of two electrons emitted from an argon atom : the momenta of the two emission electrons tend to have the same magnitude and sign in the polarization direction . on the theoretical side , by solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation for two electrons in three dimensions , taylor et al @xcite gave that the most of double ionization probability flux tends to emerge to the same side of the ion . </S>",
    "<S> similar conclusions have been drawn from one - dimensional model @xcite .    in this paper , </S>",
    "<S> based on the 3d semiclassical rescattering model developed recently @xcite , we investigate the dynamical behavior of the correlated electrons in the double ionization process by analyzing their classical trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> this investigation , as shown later , is very helpful to understand the physical mechanism behind the momentum correlation . </S>",
    "<S> the model atom we use is the helium , however we argue that our discussions are available to the other multi - electron atoms , like the argon in recent experiment@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> firstly , we briefly present the semiclassical rescattering model adopted in our calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the ionization of the first electron from bound state to the continues state is treated by the tunnelling ionization theory generalized by delone et al . @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subsequent evolution of the ionized electron and the bound electron in the combined coulomb potential and the laser fields is described by a classical newtonian equation . to emulate the evolution of the electron , a set of trajectories </S>",
    "<S> is launched with initial conditions taken into from the wave function of the tunnelling electron .    </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the two electrons after the first electron tunnelled are described by the classical equations ( in atomic unit ) : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the laser field . </S>",
    "<S> the indices @xmath10 and @xmath11 refer to the tunnel ionized and bound electron respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the potentials are @xmath12    the initial condition of the tunnelled electron , under the sae approximation of he@xmath13 , is determined by a equation including the effective potential given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite and a generalized tunnelling formula developed by delone et al . </S>",
    "<S> . in parabolic coordinates , the schrdinger equation for a hydrogen - like atom in a uniform field @xmath14 is written ( in atomic unit ) , @xmath15 in which @xmath16 @xmath17 is the negative ionization potential of the outer electron .    </S>",
    "<S> the above equation has the form of the one - dimensional schrdinger equation with the potential @xmath18 and the energy @xmath19    the evolution of the outer electron is traced by launching a set of trajectories with different initial parameters @xmath20 and @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the initial velocity perpendicular to the polarization of the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the initial position of the electron born at time @xmath20 is given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 from the eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sch ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the initial velocity is set to be @xmath25 @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the weight of each trajectory is evaluated by @xcite @xmath27 @xmath28 and where @xmath29 is the tunnelling rate in the quasistatic approximation @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the initial state of the bounded electron is described by assuming that the electron is in the ground state of he@xmath13 with energy @xmath30 and its initial distribution is microcanonical distribution @xcite .    in our calculation , the eqs . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq1 ] ) are solved in a time interval between @xmath20 and @xmath31 by employing the standard runge - kuta algorithm@xmath32 during the first ten optical cycles the electric field amplitude is constant , and then the field is switched off using a @xmath33 envelope during three cycles , and during the last two optical cycles the electrons is free from the electric field . </S>",
    "<S> the wavelength is @xmath34 @xmath35 , which is so chosen to match the experiment @xcite , and the intensity of laser is @xmath36 which is right at the ` knee ' region of the double ionization of helium . @xmath37 or more initial points are randomly distributed in the parameter plane @xmath38 @xmath39 for the outer electron and in the microcanonical distribution for the inner electron . </S>",
    "<S> the distribution for the ionization electron can be obtained by making statistics on an ensemble of classical trajectories weighed by the ( [ wei1 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the results have been tested for numerical convergence by increasing the number of trajectories .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 1 shows the momentum correlation between the two emission electrons in the double ionization of the present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the horizontal axis shows the momentum component of the first electron in the direction of polarization @xmath40 and the vertical axis the same momentum component of the second electron @xmath41 this figure shows a strong correlation between the momenta of the two electrons . </S>",
    "<S> there is a clear maximum for both electrons being emitted with the same momentum component in the direction of polarization axis of about @xmath42 @xmath17 , and emission to opposite half planes is strongly suppressed , i.e. , both two electrons tend to fly to same side of ion in the direction of polarization . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomena has been observed in the ` knee ' region for argon @xcite . on the other hand , from fig . 1 </S>",
    "<S> , we see that the maximum momentum of both electron is about @xmath43 @xmath44which is consist with the electron - ion coincidence experiment observation of helium @xcite , in which the maximum energy of emission electron in nsdi process is @xmath45 since the perpendicular component of momentum is small , the maximum momentum component in the polarization direction can be approximate obtained as @xmath46 @xmath47    an useful alternative perspective on fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 is obtained by rotating the distribution by @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> then we can get two new distributions . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(a ) , we show the distribution of the sum momentum @xmath49 ; in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2(b ) , we show the distribution of the difference momentum @xmath50 @xmath51 . owing to momentum conservation , the sum momentum of emission electrons is equal and opposite to the he@xmath52 recoil ion momentum @xcite , so its distribution , as we know , shows a characteristic double - hump structure with a central minima . </S>",
    "<S> a vast amount of literature has devoted to discuss the double - hump structure of momenta of recoil ions @xcite , here we only pay attention to the correlation between the two emission electrons .    comparing the fig.2(a ) with fig.2(b ) , one finds that the sum momentum at the peak is about @xmath53 , almost above the maximum momentum of each electron , and the maximum sum momentum is almost @xmath54 @xmath44 about twice of the maximum momentum of one electron ; furthermore the distribution width of difference moment is much smaller than the one of the sum momentum . </S>",
    "<S> these features indicate the momenta parallel to polarization axis of the two emission electrons likely have the same direction . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the peak of the distribution of difference momentum is at zero , so the momenta of the two emission electron tend to have the equal magnitude .    to study the origin of the correlation of electrons emission , we show two trajectories of the electrons in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 . fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(a ) shows a typical trajectory of which the difference momentum in polarization direction is small and fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(b ) shows a typical trajectory of which the difference momentum in polarization direction is nearly the maximum . from these trajectories </S>",
    "<S> , it can be concluded that after the second electron ionized the momentum transfer received from the laser field is almost identical for both electron . because the electron can obtain very high energy from the laser </S>",
    "<S> , the momenta of the two thus be accelerated to the same direction . on the other hand , this part of the acceleration only adds to the sum of the momenta of the two electrons , but does not change the difference of the momenta </S>",
    "<S> . therefore the difference of the momenta is only determined by the ionization process of the second electron .    as we have discussed before </S>",
    "<S> , the second electron is mostly ionized by the `` recollision '' mechanism : the second electron is ionized by a collision with the tunnelled electron @xcite . because the collision between the two electrons is almost instantaneous so that the energy is conserved approximately when the collision happens . </S>",
    "<S> the total energy of the two electron can be expressed by @xmath55 where @xmath56 includes the potentials and the kinetic energy of the perpendicular parts . to the best of our knowledge </S>",
    "<S> , so far the energy distribution of the returning electron has not been reported , but we believe that it exhibits a peak at zero energy and decreases as the energy increasing , on the other hand , only the returning electron which energy is above the ionization potential of the bound electron @xmath57 can cause the second electron ionized , so the total energy of the two electrons soon after the collision occurred is small and its distribution peaks at zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the @xmath58 is more likely zero , i.e. , the momentum components in the polarization direction of the two emission electrons are likely equal to each other . </S>",
    "<S> the returning electrons are known to have a maximum classical kinetic energy of @xmath59 therefore the maximum difference momentum must satisfy @xmath60 so @xmath61 .    on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> since the total energy of the two electrons soon after the collision occurring is small , the total final energy of the two emission electrons mostly reflect the energy transfer received from the field . </S>",
    "<S> the field acceleration make the sum momentum increase . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum energy for an electron in the double ionization process is about @xmath62 @xcite , from eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ energy ] ) , assuming the two emission electron have the same energy , we can obtain the maximum sum momentum @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that the joint acceleration of the electrons in the laser field clearly dominates over the influence of the electron repulsion , and both electrons ionized are driven by the laser to the same side .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated the momentum correlation between magnitude and direction of the two emission electrons in nonsequence double ionization . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results on the helium show a significant correlation on the momentum of the two electrons : the emission electrons tend to have the same momentum component in the polarization direction . </S>",
    "<S> the phenomena can be directly comprehended from the classical collisional trajectories . </S>",
    "<S> these discussions suggest that the correlated electrons emission in double ionization process is a semiclassical process . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluated the width of distribution of the sum and difference momentum . </S>",
    "<S> because the difference momentum is only determined by the ionization process , so it is important to verify the dominating process in the `` knee '' regime . </S>",
    "<S> based on the rescattering model , we argue that the maximum difference momentum of the two emission electrons is @xmath64 the predictions coincide with the argon experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we hope our discussions will stimulate the experimental works on the helium in the direction .    we are indebt to dr . jing chen for reading our paper and proposing many suggestive opinions </S>",
