    "in ferromagnetic metals not only the charge of the electron but also the spin plays an important role in transport phenomena .",
    "a famous example is the observation of the giant magnetoresistance in magnetic multilayers , which can be explained in terms of a spin dependent electronic scattering .",
    "the presence of a domain wall ( dw ) in a ferromagnet can also change transport properties and this has been observed in a number of experiments . at the first glance , experimental data seems to contradict to each other . in refs .",
    "@xcite it was found that the resistance of ferromagnetic wires and films decreases when increasing the external magnetic field , whereas in refs .",
    "@xcite the resistance at zero magnetic field was found to be smaller than the one measured at high magnetic fields .    in order to give a quantitative description of these experiments not only the dw contribution to the magnetoresistance ( mr )",
    "should be taken into account but also other mechanisms , as the anisotropic magnetoresistance , which arises due to the spin - orbit scattering @xcite , size effects and the lorentz contribution inside the domains .",
    "the main experimental difficulty in determining the dw contribution is to exclude the other effects .",
    "for example in ref.@xcite the negative mr observed in co films was interpreted in terms of dw scattering .",
    "however in ref.@xcite it was claimed that the predominant contributions to the observed magnetoresistance of co films can be explained by a specific micromagnetic structure , which consists of stripe - domains with magnetization out - of - the - film plane .",
    "in addition , the films show closure caps at the surfaces with magnetization in plane and parallel to the current .",
    "thus , the resistivity anisotropy might play a fundamental role .",
    "understanding the details of these experiments is an interesting task .",
    "however , before taking into account all material specific characteristics of the experiments one should be able to describe general properties of electron scattering on domain walls . in this paper , we do not try to give an explanation of all these experiments , but solve an idealized model that may capture the most general features of transport in the presence of a dw .",
    "we calculate the resistance of a ferromagnetic wire with a dw and restrict ourself to the case when the magnetization of the ferromagnetic structure remains always perpendicular to the current .",
    "this assumption simplifies the situation because in this case anisotropic effects do not contribute to the change of the resistance .",
    "the dw contribution to the conductance has been considered in several theoretical works , in which different approaches have been used .",
    "for example in refs .",
    "@xcite quantum effects ( weak localization ) were taken into account .",
    "it was shown that a dw contributes to the decoherence of electrons leading to a decrease of the resistance .",
    "these effects may be important at very low temperatures when localization effects start playing a noticeable role .    at higher temperatures",
    "the weak localization effects are not important and one may try to describe the magnetoresistance in terms of classical motion . in recent works , refs .",
    "@xcite , an increase of the resistance due to a dw was predicted on the basis of a boltzmann equation .",
    "however , the collision term describing scattering of conduction electrons on impurities was introduced phenomenologically .",
    "the classical dw resistance was calculated also in ref .",
    "@xcite . in that work",
    ", it was shown that the dw resistance could be both negative and positive depending on the difference between the momentum relaxation times @xmath4 for the different spin directions .",
    "however , the classical drude expression for the resistivity was used , in which the relaxation times @xmath5 were introduced again as phenomenological parameters .  in refs.@xcite the resistance of a dw located in a point contact was calculated .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to derive a proper kinetic equation for the distribution function from a microscopic model and to calculate the dw resistance on its basis .",
    "we employ a standard approach based on microscopic equations for the quasiclassical green s functions in the keldysh technique . assuming that the impurity scattering potential @xmath6  is spin dependent",
    ", we derive the kinetic equation for the matrix ( in the nambu and spin space ) distribution function . as a result",
    "we come to the kinetic equation for the ditribution function @xmath7 that is a @xmath8 matrix in the spin space.the impurity scattering potential which enters the collision integral is also a matrix and this makes the equation considerably more complicated than the standard one that could be written for a spin independent scattering .    throughout this article",
    "we assume that the magnetization remains always perpendicular to the current .",
    "first we solve the derived kinetic equation in two simplest cases : a single domain and two domain structure with an abrupt dw ( i.e. the width of the dw equals zero ) . in the case of a finite dw width",
    "we solve the kinetic equation assuming the potentials @xmath9  and @xmath10  do not differ much from each other . even in this limit , it is hard to obtain analytical formulae for an arbitrary width of the dw .",
    "two different limiting cases naturally arise and this allows us to obtain a solution for the distribution function .",
    "the first limit corresponds to a sharp dw ( to a small exchange energy @xmath1  ) .",
    "the second limit corresponds to a smooth dw ( to a large @xmath1  ) .",
    "we note that only the second limit was analyzed in refs .",
    "@xcite . as in refs .",
    "@xcite we obtain that the dw increases the resistance of the system .",
    "however our formulae for the contribution of the dw to the resistance differ essentially from those presented in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized in the following way . in the next section",
    "we introduce the model and derive the  kinetic equation for the distribution function in a ferromagnetic wire  neglecting quantum effects .",
    "we start from the microscopic hamiltonian ( [ 2 ] )  with different scattering rates at impurities for spin - up and spin down - electrons . in the subsequent sections we  calculate the conductance of the system in the diffusive limit . in section [ 3a ]",
    "we consider the case of a sharp dw when @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath13 is the width of the dw and @xmath1 is the exchange field acting on the electron spin . in section [ 3b ]",
    "we calculate the conductance of a `` slowly '' varying dw , _",
    "i. e. _ we consider the case @xmath14 .",
    "it turns out that in the first case the conductance is always smaller than in the adiabatic case . in the last section",
    "we summarize our results .",
    "in this section we derive the kinetic equation for the matrix distribution function @xmath15 starting from equations for the quasiclassical green functions . the function @xmath15 is a @xmath8 matrix in the spin space .",
    "we assume that the impurity scattering rate depends on the spin directions but , for simplicity , we neglect such spin - flip processes as the spin - orbit interaction or the scattering by magnetic impurities .",
    "so , in our model each impurity scattering vertex is a matrix that does not commute with @xmath15 and therefore the elastic collision integral has a nontrivial form .",
    "this fact has been ignored in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the collision integral was written phenomenologically .    using the derived kinetic equation",
    "we calculate the conductance of a mesoscopic structure which consists of two reservoirs and a ferromagnetic wire ( or film ) connecting the reservoirs ( see fig .",
    "a domain wall is assumed to be present in the ferromagnet .",
    "we consider the diffusive limit , which means that the mean free path is the shortest length ( apart from the fermi wave length ) in the problem .",
    "we solve the kinetic equation assuming the smallness of the parameter @xmath16 , defined as    @xmath17    where @xmath18 are conductivities for different spin directions . a precise relation between the conductivities @xmath19 , as well as the diffusion coefficients @xmath20",

    "the case a ) corresponds to a sharp dw .",
    "the conductance in this case is smaller than the conductance of the structure without the domain wall .",
    "a finite width of the domain wall leads to a positive correction to the conductance .",
    "the second case corresponds to a smooth ( compared to the magnetic length @xmath25 ) dw . in the limit of a large @xmath13",
    "the conductance of the structure is close to that of a structure without a dw . with decreasing the width of the dw , the conductance of the structure decreases .",
    "our results significantly differ significantly from the results obtained in other works , where either the collision term was oversimplified @xcite , or the kinetic equation was not treated in a correct way @xcite .",
