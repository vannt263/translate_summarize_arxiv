    "( [ sigma_x ] ) to compare victor s variances when @xmath265 and when @xmath266 with the same degree of squeezing as in fig .",
    "[ qt_trace ] .",
    "we thus infer that if victor had perfect detectors , the variance of bob s teleported output field ( or equivalently now , victor s variance as measured by his photocurrent ) is given by @xmath268 above the shot - noise level , which corresponds to an inferred fidelity of @xmath269 .    returning to fidelity referenced to victor s photocurrent",
    ", we estimate that with @xmath148 pump power in each opo path , where we have measured @xmath155 squeezing and @xmath156 anti - squeezing at victor ( see fig .",
    "[ squeez_trace ] ) , the epr entanglement at the epr beamsplitter is characterized by the factors : @xmath270 and @xmath271 .",
    "these numbers were obtained by back - propagating the squeezed beams to the epr beamsplitter from victor s homodyne detectors , considering the effects of victor s homodyne efficiency @xmath272 , photodiode quantum efficiency @xmath273 and the epr homodyne efficiency @xmath274 . with measured efficiencies @xmath237 , @xmath275 , @xmath276 , @xmath277 , the predicted variance of the teleported output state emerging from bob",
    "s beamsplitter is @xmath278 .",
    "the inferred fidelity would then be @xmath279 .",
    "by contrast , our best entanglement - assisted noise reduction measured by victor s balanced detector is @xmath280 below the level with no epr beams , which corresponds to @xmath281 and an inferred fidelity @xmath282 , as has been discussed .",
    "to gain more insight into this discrepancy , we performed an analogous study to that shown in fig .",
    "[ vic_pump ] , where we plot the inferred fidelities from the measured variances versus pump power in fig .",
    "[ fidelity_pump ] .",
    "the inferred experimental fidelities peak at around @xmath262 corresponding to the minimum in victor s measured variance . here",
    "we also show the values of @xmath13 that we might be able to reach with the current apparatus .",
    "first of all , the square symbols in fig .  [ fidelity_pump ] derive from the inferred degrees of squeezing at the epr beamsplitter that are deduced from the data in fig .",
    "[ squeez_pump ] .",
    "this was done from the measurement results by back - propagating the squeezed beams from victor s homodyne detector to the epr beamsplitter as previously described .",
    "in addition , the triangles in fig .",
    "[ fidelity_pump ] correspond to the inferred fidelities from the theoretically predicted degrees of squeezing given by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ squeez_pump ] .",
    "it can be seen that the disagreement between the predicted and measured fidelities is already apparent at low pump powers .",
    "however , the mismatch becomes more pronounced at higher pump powers where the measured fidelities start to decrease rather than increase with the pump level .    , and triangles are the expected fidelities based on our theoretically predicted degrees of squeezing in fig .",
    "[ squeez_pump ] .",
    "again , the lines connecting the data points are to ease viewing . ]",
    "there are several factors contributing to the discrepancy between the measured and predicted variances and fidelities .",
    "the first is phase fluctuations from different locking systems , especially the epr phase - lock . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ phase_qt ] , phase fluctuations add extra noise to the quadratures , and this effect is more pronounced at higher pump powers where the anti - squeezed quadrature is large .",
    "another factor is the bandwidth of our two classical channels , which by bad design on our part , has been found to have excessive phase variation over the relevant rf bandwidth for the undistorted transmission of classical information .",
    "in fact , by an aforementioned technique , we measured the actual subtraction of the rf signal at @xmath221 through the classical channels and epr2 .",
    "it was found that frequency offsets of about @xmath283 led to drops in the cancellation from @xmath284 to @xmath285 .",
    "when the offset was @xmath286 , the cancellation is only @xmath287 . increasing the bandwidth while keeping relatively high isolation for",
    "the filter for various control signals ( e.g. , modulations at @xmath206 and @xmath205 ) in the classical channels will be helpful .",
    "a third reason for the discrepancy in victor s variances is the imperfect character of bob s eoms , which cause coupling between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 quadratures , again resulting in contamination between squeezing and anti - squeezing . in order to reach higher fidelity ,",
    "we are working to improve these aspects of the experiment .",
    "we have described the details of recent experimental work to perform quantum teleportation for continuous variables . we have discussed a real experimental system where we considered many of the prevalent loss sources in our experiment , thus providing a detailed analysis of how the variances measured at alice and victor during teleportation vary with squeezing and ultimately opo pump power .",
    "phase fluctuations due to imperfect locking systems were also discussed , and it has been shown that nonideal detection schemes as well as phase fluctuations eventually degrade the noise reduction recorded by victor and consequently reduce the teleportation fidelity .    we have discussed how to prepare experimentally the entangled epr beams .",
    "our entangled epr fields at the epr beamsplitter were typically characterized by @xmath288 and @xmath289 according to our measured squeezing and efficiencies , which implies that our measured prospective fidelity would be @xmath2 .",
    "the experimental setup and procedure was described in detail , including the opo , the source of the entangled epr fields .",
    "we have discussed optical phase - lock servo systems that ensure alice is able to correctly measure the two orthogonal quadratures , @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "lastly , we have also described our classical channels through which classical information in the form of photocurrents obtained by alice can be sent to bob with the goals of minimal distortion and proper phase and gain in order to be sure that bob can use that information to recover the original input state .",
    "the teleportation procedure was investigated for arbitrary unknown coherent states with any phase and a wide range of amplitudes .",
    "the experiment clearly revealed the quduties that limit the classical performance of such a teleportation system .",
    "victor unavoidably measures two extra units of vacuum noise if there is no entanglement . by employing the entangled fields of the epr state",
    ", we demonstrated that the quduties were suppressed by @xmath290 , which corresponds to an inferred fidelity of @xmath0 for coherent states , which when corrected for the efficiency of detection by victor , gives a fidelity of @xmath1 .",
    "the apparatus was shown to succeed for arbitrary coherent states with amplitudes up to @xmath291 above the vacuum level .",
    "this demonstrates that with entanglement , the procedure exhibits better performance than the classical bound of fidelity @xmath60 @xcite , and hence is genuinely a quantum protocol for unconditional teleportation .",
    "we discussed alice s and victor s measured variances as functions of opo pump power .",
    "the data in fig .",
    "[ vic_pump ] showed that at low pump powers , alice s measured variance @xmath292 increased and victor s measured variance @xmath293 decreased with pump power , as expected .",
    "however , at higher pump powers ( above @xmath294 ) , while @xmath292 continued to increase with pump as expected , @xmath293 did not continue to decrease , but began increasing instead .",
    "this implied that the anti - squeezing quadrature contaminates the squeezed quadrature at high pump powers .",
    "possible reasons for this contamination include fluctuations in the phase - lock servos , limited classical channel bandwidth and impure amplitude and phase modulators at bob s station .",
    "it is encouraging to note that our high detection efficiencies together with the relatively high degree of entanglement that we have achieved shows that our apparatus is capable of producing higher fidelity between the input and output states .",
    "in addition , a new scheme with the opo pumped only by a single unidirectional blue beam to form the epr state is being planned .",
    "we could then hope to obtain over @xmath295 of entanglement by mitigating high bliira , and thus reducing the intracavity losses in the opo .",
    "such capabilities would be of interest to quantum information processing with continuous quantum variables @xcite .",
    "the contributions of j.  buck and a.  furusawa are gratefully acknowledged .",
