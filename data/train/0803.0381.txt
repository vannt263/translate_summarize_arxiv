    "when confronted with experiments , the standard model ( sm ) of fundamental forces has proven to be very robust both in its general structure as well as in every detail tested so far . however , a satisfactory understanding of the origin of electro - weak symmetry breaking mechanism has been an ever elusive problem . in the sm electro - weak symmetry @xmath0",
    "is spontaneously broken to @xmath1 through a non - zero vacuum expectation value of an @xmath2 doublet of elementary scalar fields .",
    "there are also other possibilities of achieving this goal .",
    "besides the obvious requirement that the weak gauge bosons @xmath3 and @xmath4 acquire the requisite masses , there is one guiding principle , known as the _ naturalness principle _ , which is largely adopted in working out any new mechanism for the symmetry breaking .",
    "the dogma or principle of naturalness expresses the belief that a small parameter in nature can not be an accident .",
    "it must be associated with a symmetry .",
    "this is in contrast to an anthropic principle .",
    "the naturalness principle is best formulated through what can be called t hooft s doctrine of naturalness @xcite :    _ at any energy scale @xmath5 , a set of parameters , @xmath6 describing a system can be small , if and only if , in the limit @xmath7 for each of these parameters , the system exhibits an enhanced symmetery . _",
    "weakly broken symmetry ensures that the smallness of a parameter is preserved against possible perturbative disturbances .",
    "let us analyse naturalness of various parameters in some of the quantum field theories that we come across in particle physics :    * ( 1 ) quantum electrodynamics is a perfectly natural theory .",
    "* this theory describes electromagnetic interaction of charged fermions , electron @xmath8 , muon @xmath9 , etc : ^_qed  =  -  1 4  f^ _ f^ _  +   ^_f = e , , ... |^_f ^_f here the electromagnetic coupling @xmath10 , the electron mass @xmath11 , the muon mass @xmath12 etc .",
    "can all be independently small .",
    "the smallness of @xmath11 ( or @xmath12 ) is protected by the fact that , in the limit @xmath13 ( or @xmath14 ) , we have an additional symmetry , the chiral symmetry which corresponds to separate conservation of the left- and right - handed electron - like leptons . no surprise that all the perturbative corrections to electron mass due to quantum fluctuations are small .",
    "these are in fact just proportional to @xmath11 itself ; the self - energy diagrams have only logarithmic divergence .",
    "also , @xmath15 enhances the symmetry ; it implies no interaction ; hence the particle number of each type is conserved in this limit .",
    "one - loop quantum correction to the electromagnetic coupling @xmath10 is indeed logarithmically divergent and is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "same discussion is valid for electromagnetic interaction of all other charged fermions and their masses , in particular for quarks .    *",
    "( 2 ) quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) is also a perfectly natural theory . *",
    "it describes the colour dynamics of @xmath17 triplet quarks @xmath18 @xmath19 and an octect of gluons @xmath20 @xmath21 : ^_qcd =  -   1 4   f^a _ f^a _   +   |^i _ ^j _ where @xmath22 are the eight generators of @xmath23 algebra in triplet representation . here",
    "again the colour coupling constant @xmath24 is natural , because in the limit @xmath25 , there is enhanced symmetry .",
    "it reflects no interaction , hence particle number of each type in conserved in this limit .",
    "one - loop perturbative quantum corrections to the coupling constant @xmath24 have only logarithmic divergence and are proportional to @xmath26",
    ". also mass parameter @xmath27 is natural because in the limit @xmath28 we have the chiral symmetry which is preserved by pertubative quantum corrections ; such corrections to @xmath27 are logarithmically divergent and are proportional to @xmath27 itself .    *",
    "( 3 ) quantum theories involving interacting elementary scalar fields are not natural .",
    "* this has to do with the fact that the mass of an elementary scalar field is not associated with any approximate symmetry . consider a self - interacting theory of a real scalar field : ^_scalar =   1 2   ^ _",
    "^ _  -   2   ^2 _  -    ^4 _    at the classical level , the limit mass @xmath28 does lead to scale invariance ; but at quantum level scale symmetry is broken . thus smallness of the scalar mass can not be protected against perturbative quantum corrections .",
    "in fact such corrections appear with quadratic divergences .",
    "for example , at one loop level , such a correction comes from the diagram in fig 1 : 0.2 cm    fig.1 .",
    "one - loop radiative correction to scalar mass    0.2 cm and it is : m^2 _ ~^^2 _ dk^2 _ ~   ^2 _    on the other hand ,",
    "the other parameter of this theory , namely the @xmath29 coupling @xmath30 is natural .",
    "this is so because , in the limit @xmath31 , we have a free scalar theory , which indeed has higher symmetry .",
    "next let us consider a more general theory containing an elementary charged scalar field where local @xmath32 gauge invariance is spontaneously broken through a nonzero vacuum expectation value of the scalar field .",
    "the theory describes a complex scalar field @xmath33 and a left - handed fermion @xmath34 interacting with a @xmath32 gauge field @xmath35 and a right - handed fermion @xmath36 which is neutral with respect to this gauge symmetry and also yukawa coupling of the fermions with the scalar field : = -1 4  f^_f^_+i|^_l^ _ ( ^_-iea^ _ ) ^_l + i|^_r ^_^_^_r + ( _ ^+ie a^ _ ) ^ * _ ( ^_-iea^ _ ) + ^2 _ ^ * _ -(^ * _ ) ^2 _ - y[higgsaction ] this theory is invariant under the following gauge transformations : a_= a^_+1 e   ^ _ ,   ",
    "= e^i _ ,  _l = e^i _ ^_l ,  _r = ^_r .",
    "the field theory described by the lagrangian density ( [ higgsaction ] ) has many of the features of the standard model of electro - weak interactions . besides a spontaneous breaking of symmetry and a higgs mechanism it also has a yukawa coupling for fermion and scalar fields which leads to the mass for fermion like in the sm . unlike the sm this theory has anomalies in the @xmath37 gauge current",
    "this can be cured by adding another left - handed fermion with opposite @xmath37 charge to the already included fermion .",
    "however the discussion of naturalness issues below does not depend on this .    of the four parameters , the dimensionless couplings @xmath10 and @xmath38 are independently natural as in the limit @xmath15 , @xmath39 we have no gauge interaction and no yukawa interaction respectively , and hence enhanced symmetries .",
    "indeed perturbative quantum corrections to these parameters are proportional to themselves .",
    "but in the case of dimesionless parameter @xmath30 situation is different . even in the limit @xmath31 at tree level ,",
    "presence of gauge and yukawa interactions induce quantum corrections , say at one loop level , to generate a non - zero @xmath40 interaction in the effective potential with a coefficient @xmath41 ( @xmath42 and @xmath43 are some constants ) due to gauge and fermion fields in the loops .",
    "this puts restrictions on how small the effective coupling @xmath30 can be .",
    "it can not be very much smaller than the gauge and yukawa couplings .",
    "the dimensionful parameter @xmath27 deserves special attention .",
    "notice due to the wrong sign of @xmath44 term @xmath45 , the @xmath32 symmetry is broken .",
    "the potential @xmath46 has a ring of minima given by @xmath47 . thus expanding the scalar field about its minimum value as @xmath48 and rotating the phase away by absorbing the field @xmath49 ( would be nambu - goldstone mode ) into the massive vector field as its longitudinal component through a change of variables : @xmath50 and also @xmath51",
    ", we obtain a theory of a massive vector field @xmath35 , a massive scalar field @xmath52 ( so called higgs field ) and a massive dirac fermion @xmath53 with their masses given by : m^_a = ev ,   m^_h =   v ,   m^ _ = 1 2   y v.    now in the limit  @xmath54  ( or equivalently  @xmath55 ) , we do have enhancement  of  symmetry classically ; in this   limit we have  ( i ) scale invariance ,  ( ii ) restored @xmath37 gauge symmetry and also , ( iii ) since dirac fermion becomes massless , chiral symmetry corresponding to the separate conservation of left- and right - handed fermions .",
    "yet this does not make the vacuum expectation value @xmath56 or the mass parameter @xmath5 of the original lagrangian ( [ higgsaction ] ) natural .",
    "none of these classical symmetries can protect the vector field mass @xmath57 , higgs field mass @xmath58 or fermion mass @xmath59 .",
    "this is so because quantum fluctuations , through the well known coleman - weinberg mechanism , break all these symmetries by inducing a non - zero vacuum expectation value of the scalar field even if it were zero to start with in this limit of the classical theory .",
    "thus at quantum level , there is no enhancement of symmetry in the limit where classical vacuum expectation value @xmath56 tends to zero .",
    "it is important to contrast this situation with the case of qed discussed above where electron mass @xmath11 is protected because chiral symmetry in the limit @xmath60 is an exact quantum symmetry .    indeed in the present context , perturbative quantum corrections to each of the masses",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 have quadratic divergences .",
    "that is , corrections to the ( mass)@xmath61 of these fields are proportional to the square of cut - off @xmath62 .",
    "the vacuum expectation value @xmath56 of the scalar field also receives radiative corrections which are quadratically divergent .",
    "these come from radiative diagrams of the type in fig 2.1 .",
    "one - loop radiative corrections to the vacuum expectation value    this one - loop correction is given by : @xmath63 @xmath64 @xmath65 where the three terms come from three diagrams of fig 2.1 .",
    "notice in the limit @xmath54 , one - loop vacuum expectation value is not zero .",
    "this is coleman - weinberg mechanism of radiative symmetry breaking .",
    "next for the higgs field @xmath66 receives a correction at one - loop level as : @xmath67 with @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , and @xmath71 are numerical constants and respectively correspond to the higgs field , gauge field and fermion field going through the loop as in fig . 2.2 .",
    "0.2 cm    fig.2.2 .",
    "one - loop radiative corrections to the higgs mass    0.2 cm    clearly this discussion holds for the standard model of electro - weak forces also . here @xmath72 symmetry is spontaneously broken to the electromagnetic symmetry @xmath73 due to the vacuum expectation value of a doublet scalar field resulting in a massive physical scalar field , the higgs field h. in the process the three weak gauge bosons @xmath74 and @xmath75 also become massive and quarks and leptons acquire their masses through yukawa couplings .",
    "thus in this model also , radiative corrections to higgs mass @xmath58 diverge quadratically as the internal momentum in the loop becomes large .",
    "then our computations break down for loop momenta @xmath76 where the cut - off @xmath62 is the energy scale up to which the sm is an adequate description of nature .",
    "we may write , say the one - loop correction to higgs boson mass due to quantum fluctuations of a size characterised by the scale @xmath62 as : m^2_h ~   ^2 _    similar corrections obtain for the vacuum expectation value of the scalar field as well as for the masses of vector bosons @xmath77 and @xmath75 and also fermions .",
    "thus , for @xmath78 , and coupling @xmath79 , the requirement that this mass does not receive large radiative corrections , @xmath80 , we have : ^2 _ ~ = = ( 1000   gev)^2 _ that is , the cut - off @xmath81",
    ". naturalness of electro - weak theory breaks down at this scale .",
    "this is not any problem if there is no physics beyond @xmath82 ; that is , if there are no elementary particles heavier than this scale , or there is no physical characteristic mass scale beyond this value .",
    "but in general , there is no reason to expect that this is so .",
    "for example , if the idea of grand unification for electro - weak and strong forces is valid , there is a physical scale , the grand - unification scale which is much larger than @xmath82 . in particular , in the @xmath83 grand unified theory ( gut )",
    "we have two widely separated scales : the gut scale @xmath84 @xmath85 where the gut gauge group @xmath86 spontaneously breaks down to the sm group @xmath87 and the scale of electro - weak physics @xmath88 where the electro - weak gauge group @xmath89 breaks down to @xmath73 .",
    "these two levels of symmetry breaking are achieved through vacuum expectation values of two sets of elementary scalar fields .",
    "it was in this context first that it was realized that the radiative corrections do not allow the two scales to be maintained at such widely separated values @xcite .",
    "in fact , not only quadratically divergent radiative diagrams , but also some times certain kind of logarithmically divergent diagrams contribute large corrections to small masses .",
    "such diagrams come with large coefficients proportional to the larger mass scale of the theory .",
    "these kind of _ large _ logarithmic divergent diagrams are typically present in guts .",
    "to understand the origin of such radiative corrections , consider a theory of two interacting scalar fields , @xmath90 and @xmath33 , which have two vastly separated vacuum expectation values generated by some suitable potentials : @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 .",
    "expanding about their expectation values @xmath94 and @xmath95 , we have two massive scalars fields with their masses @xmath96 and @xmath97 .",
    "a possible interaction of the type @xmath98 in the original potential would lead , after shifting the fields by their vacuum expectation values , to effective three - point vertices of the form @xmath99 with a large dimensionful coupling @xmath100 .",
    "such vertices will in turn lead to a _",
    "large _ logarithmically divergent radiative correction to the mass of the light scalar field @xmath101 as m^2_h ~a^2  f^2  ^2    from a radiative diagram shown in fig.2.3 :    0.1 cm    fig.2.3 .",
    "_ large _ logarithmically divergent radiative correction    0.2 cm    such corrections along with those large corrections from quadratically divergent diagrams would destabilise the mass of lighter scalar field .",
    "this is a generic feature of all such theories of scalar fields with two widely separated scales . in particular , it is true of guts : perturbative quantum corrections tend to draw the smaller electro - weak scale @xmath102 towards the gut scale @xmath103 .",
    "this problem known as the _ gauge hierarchy problem _ of grand unified theories is due to the fact that field theories containing elementary scalars are not natural .",
    "not only this , there is yet another much larger and important physical mass scale @xmath104 in nature which is associated with quantum gravity .",
    "this would imply that the radiative corrections would draw the masses of electro - weak theory to this high scale and hence their natural values would be @xmath105 and not the physical values characterised by the sm scale of @xmath106 !",
    "what this quantum instability of the higgs potential strongly suggests that there has to be some new physics beyond @xmath82 such that the sm with its characteristic scale of @xmath107 stays natural beyond this scale . or otherwise there can not be any fundamental scale in nature beyond @xmath82",
    "; in particular the scale of four dimensional gravity , @xmath108 can not be a fundamental scale ; but it should be derived from some new physics characterised by a fundamental scale of @xmath109 only .",
    "earliest discovered solution to the naturalness problem of electro - weak theory is one where the higgs particle is not an elemetary particle but a spin - less composite of a fermion and anti - fermion .",
    "this is the technicolour solution @xcite .",
    "the constituents of the higgs boson are to be held together by a new strong force .",
    "known interactions like colour @xmath110 are not sufficiently strong at the electro - weak energy scale , a new much stronger interaction is needed to obtain the required bound states and @xmath111 are not adequate , much heavier top quark with its strong coupling to the electro - weak sector , may serve the purpose .",
    "it is worthwhile to ponder over this possibility of symmetry breaking where the higgs boson would be a @xmath112 @xmath113 bound state .",
    "but unfortunately , this minimalist idea of a composite higgs boson does not work because it requires a top quark of mass much heavier that the experimentally observed value @xcite . ] .",
    "this interaction should exhibit confinement .",
    "for no better reason than the fact qcd is a confining gauge theory , the new interaction is postulated to be a qcd type theory , though , operative at a higher scale of about @xmath109 , where its running coupling constant becomes of order unity . the higgs particle",
    "would then be built in the same fashion as pions are in qcd .",
    "if we were to probe the higgs particle with energies greater than @xmath114 , we would see it not as an elementary scalar particle , but instead as a fermion and an anti - fermion . except for a few",
    ", most of the physical states of this new theory would have high enough masses characterised by the high energy scale of this theory .",
    "historically a variety of names were proposed for these new fermions such as metafermions ( t hooft ) , heavy fermions ( weinberg ) , hyperfermions ( eichten and lane ) , technifermions ( susskind ) and the new interaction experienced by them was called metacolour , heavy colour , hypercolour and technicolour respectively . the last nomenclature has survived over years .    since theories with fermions and gauge fields like qed and qcd as indicated earlier , are natural , technicolour theories do not suffer from naturalness problem .",
    "besides technicolour forces , the techniquarks are also supposed to experience electro - weak interactions .",
    "simplest technicolour model can be build in terms of an @xmath115 doublet @xmath116 of techniquarks and two right - handed singlets @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "such theory exhibits an additional global flavour symmetry @xmath119 which is broken to @xmath120 @xmath121 through the condensation of the techniquarks leading to three nambu -goldstone bosons ( technipions ) @xmath122 .",
    "these then in turn induce required masses for the weak interaction bosons @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "these masses fix the analog of the pion decay constant @xmath123 of the new interaction , defined in terms of matrix elements of the associated spontaneously broken axial current @xmath124 by :  =   iq^ _",
    "f^_tc   ^_ab the @xmath125 boson mass is related in a model independent way to the technipion decay constant as : m^_w  =   1 2  g^_2  f^_tc where @xmath126 is the @xmath115 coupling constant .",
    "because of the isospin symmetry of the strong interaction , the relation @xmath127 holds as long as electric charge is conserved .",
    "now the technipion decay constant can be fixed by relating it to the fermi constant @xmath128 of weak interaction as follows : f^_tc  =   2 g^_2   m^_w  =  ( 2g^_f ) ^-1 2 _  =   250   gev .",
    "since techni - qcd is only a scaled up qcd , the technipion decay constant @xmath123 and ordinary qcd pion decay constant @xmath129 are related as @xmath130 @xmath131 where @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the scales at which the qcd and techni - qcd coupling constants respectively become strong .",
    "taking @xmath134 @xmath135 , we have the techni - qcd scale @xmath136 .",
    "this does yield a possible dynamical explanation of the origin of masses of electro - weak bosons @xmath74 and @xmath75 , but does not provide for the masses of ordinary quarks and leptons which in the standard model are generated through yukawa couplings of these fermions with the elementary scalar field . in the technicolour framework , to generate these masses a new gauge interaction , the extended technicolour ( etc ) is introduced .",
    "the gauge bosons of this new interaction , with their masses in the range @xmath137 - @xmath138 , connect the ordinary quarks and leptons to techniquarks ; thus providing a mechanism for masses for quarks and leptons .",
    "there are some serious phenomenological difficulties with such scenarios .",
    "these include not enough suppression of flavour changing neutral current effects , heavier higgs particle , presence of large anomalous contributions to the @xmath139 vertex and large contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath140 , @xmath141 and @xmath142 parameters .",
    "but these difficulties may be the problem of specific model for the dynamics of force responsible for holding the constituent fermions together in the composite higgs boson .",
    "it may be that a qcd - type model for this force is not adequate .",
    "in particular , the relation @xmath143 implied by the scaled up qcd - type model for the new interactions is too restrictive .",
    "that supersymmetry also provides a solution to the naturalness problem of electro - weak theory was realized about 27 years ago @xcite .",
    "this option retains the elementarity of the scalar field .",
    "while composite higgs boson is a non - perturbative solution to the problem , supersymmetry provides a perturbative solution .",
    "an elementary property of quantum field theory which gives an extra minus sign for the radiative diagram with a fermionic as against a boson field going around in a loop allows for the possibility that naturalness violating effects due to bosonic and fermionic quantum fluctuations can be arranged to cancel against each other . for this to happen the various couplings of bosons and fermions have to be related to each other in a highly restrictive manner .",
    "further , for such a cancellation to hold at every order of perturbation theory , a symmetry between bosons and fermions would be imperative .",
    "this is what supersymmetry indeed does provide .    in most of the supersymmetric field theories , troublesome quadratic divergences and",
    "also the _ large _ logarithmic divergences are independently absent @xcite .",
    "this happens due to exact cancellation of such divergences between graphs with bosonic and fermion fields going around in the loops . while supersymmetric theories with a non - abelian symmetry are always free of such divergences , those with @xmath37 symmetry do have radiative corrections with quadratic divergence which are proportional to the sum of @xmath37 charges of all the fields .",
    "so theories which have @xmath37 charges adding up to zero do not have quadratic divergences .",
    "supersymmetrized standard model is one such theory .",
    "this would , in particular , be also the case for any theory with an @xmath37 symmetry that can be embedded in a non - abelian group .",
    "also in supersymmetric field theories where gauge symmetry is broken spontaneously through non - zero vacuum expectation value of a scalar field , like in the sm , the limit when this vacuum expectation value goes to zero does indeed lead to an enhancement of symmetry even at the quantum level , provided , if there is a @xmath37 symmetry present in the theory , @xmath37 charges add up to zero .",
    "quantum corrections do not spoil this symmetry ; unlike the non - supersymmetric case , coleman - weinberg mechanism does not produce radiative violation of the symmetry . the higgs boson mass is natural here and also so are the masses generated for gauge bosons through higgs mechanism and the fermion masses generated through yukawa couplings to scalar field with non - zero vacuum expectation value .",
    "supersymmetry requires that bosons and fermions come in families @xcite : photon has a fermionic partner , the photino ; electron s bosonic partner is selectron ; quarks have scalar partners squarks , etc .",
    "similarly , if we are interested in gravity , spin @xmath144 graviton has a fermionic super - partner spin @xmath145 gravitino .",
    "exact supersymmetry would imply that all properties except the spin of particles in a supermultiplet are the same .",
    "thus , the masses and couplings of super partners would exactly be same .",
    "this , however , is not seen to be the case in nature , otherwise we would have , for example , already observed the super partner of electron , selectron with same charge and mass as the electron .",
    "supersymmetry has to be broken in nature . but",
    "this breaking should be such that the basic reason of naturalness does not get out of hand again .",
    "while particle and sparticle masses , @xmath146 and @xmath147 , have to be different , with @xmath147 sufficiently high to have escaped detection till now , the cancellation of bosonic and fermionic radiative corrections need only be up to the naturalness breakdown scale of the sm : |^^2 _ dk^2 _ - ^^2 _ dk^2 _",
    "|  ~  |m^2_spart - m^2_part |   ^2 _   ( 1   tev ) ^2_. so the supersymmetry breaking has to be such that quadratically divergent parts of the radiative corrections cancel , but logarithmically divergent contributions need not cancel exactly .",
    "such situations are obtained if supersymmetry is broken spontaneously or by what are called soft - terms in the action .",
    "in recent times , an alternative symmetry breaking mechanism for electroweak theory has been proposed where the higgs boson , though an elementary scalar particle , is a pseudo - nambu - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "such a higgs boson is massless at the tree level .",
    "the symmetry is explicitly broken by weakly coupled operators in the theory so that the higgs boson acquires mass without generating any quadratically divergent contributions at one - loop level ; it has only a logarithmically divergent correction at this level .",
    "it is hoped that this mass is protected by the global symmetry with which the higgs boson is associated as a nambu - goldstone boson when this symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "the electro - weak @xmath72 is embedded in a larger gauge group , simplest being @xmath148 .",
    "models based on such an idea are called little higgs models .    to understand the underlying structure",
    "let us consider an @xmath149 gauge theory with two scalar fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 , each transforming as a complex triplet of the gauge group described by the lagrangian density :    = | ( ^_+iga^_)^_1 |^2 _ + | ( ^_+ ig a^_)^_2 |^2 _ - 1 2   tr  f^ _ f^ _ - v(^_1 , ^_2 ) [ lhaction ] where the potential is : v(^_1 , ^_2 )  =   2 ( ^_1 ^_1 -f^2 _ ) ^2 _ +   2 ( ^_2 ^_2 - f^2 _ ) ^2 _ [ potential ]    this potential has two global @xmath149 symmetries acting on the two triplets which are broken to two @xmath2 symmetries through the tree level vacuum expectation values @xmath152 @xmath153 .",
    "this produces ten nambu - goldstone bosons , five each from the two spontaneous breakings @xmath154 .",
    "further , the gauge couplings in the lagrangian density above represent a weakly gauged vector @xmath149 such that the global @xmath155 ^ 2_{}$ ] is explicitly broken to a diagonal @xmath17 .",
    "five of the nambu - goldstone bosons become the longitudinal components of the five gauge fields through the higgs mechanism , leaving behind other five nambu - goldstone bosons which are massless at the tree level .",
    "now let us understand the naturalness properties of this model : is the higgs particle mass so generated natural ? in the original lagrangian density ( [ lhaction ] ) , we have one dimensionful parameter , namely @xmath156 which is the tree level expectation value of the scalar fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 . in the limit @xmath157 , classically we do have enhanced symmetry .",
    "but at quantum level , like any theory of elementary scalar fields , this is not so due to the coleman - weinberg mechanism .",
    "hence the vacuum expectation values of the scalar fields , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , are not protected .",
    "these do receive large , quadratically divergent , corrections due to quantum fluctuations at one loop itself .    for definiteness ,",
    "we write the one - loop correction to the effective potential as : = ^2_^2 _ ( g^2 _ , ^2 _ ) ( ^_1 ^_1 + ^_2 ^_2 ) +  ( g^2 )    @xmath160 and @xmath161 with @xmath69 , @xmath70 and @xmath71 as numerical factors .",
    "the first term with quadratic divergence comes from diagrams ( a ) , ( b ) , ( c ) and ( d ) and the last logarithmically divergent term comes from the diagram ( e ) of fig.3 below : 0.2 cm    fig.3 .",
    "one - loop radiative corrections    0.2 cm adding this to the tree level potential , we have one - loop effective potential as : v^_1loop = 2 ( ^_1 ^_1 -f^2 _ ) ^2 _ +   2 ( ^_2 ^_2 - f^2 _ ) ^2 _ -  ( g^2 ) |^_1 ^_2|^2 _ ( ^2_/ f^2 _ ) [ 1loopeff ] where @xmath162 is the one - loop corrected vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields : ^_1loop = < ^_2",

    "now the triplet scalar fields can be expanded about their vacuum expectation value as : ^_1 = e^i^a_t^a_/f _ (    c 0 + 0 + f+^_1    ) ,  ^_2 = e^-i^a_t^a_/f _ (    c 0 + 0 + f+^_2    ) where @xmath163 are the @xmath149 generators and displaying only the left over five nambu - goldstone bosons in the exponent we write : ^a_t^a _ = 1 2 (    ccc 0 & 0 & h^_1 + 0 & 0 & h^_2 + h^*_1 & h^*_2 & 0    ) + 4 (    ccc 1 & 0 & 0 + 0 & 1 & 0 + 0 & 0 & -2    ) [ para ]    the complex fields @xmath164 are to be identified with the standard model doublet of scalar fields and @xmath165 is a singlet neutral real scalar field . at tree level",
    "the vacuum expectation value of the scalar fields @xmath150 and @xmath151 leaves an @xmath2 gauge symmetry unbroken ; fields @xmath166 and @xmath167 and also @xmath165 have zero vacuum expectation values .",
    "all the five nambu - goldstone bosons @xmath166 , @xmath167 and @xmath165 are massless at this level . but quantum corrections involving the gauge interactions of ( [ lhaction ] ) represented by the last logarithmically divergent term in the one - loop effective potential ( [ 1loopeff ] ) above and also other such contributions from possible interactions with fermions of the theory which we have not displayed here , allows the doublet @xmath101 to pick up a non - zero vacuum expectation value and hence break the @xmath2 gauge symmetry in the standard way leading to three real fields becoming the longitudinal components of the @xmath2 gauge bosons leaving one massive real higgs particle @xmath52 .",
    "this follows immediately if we use the parametrisation ( [ para ] ) to write the expansion : |^_1 ^_2|^2_=  f^2 _ where @xmath168 and @xmath169 are positive numerical coefficients .",
    "the first two terms of effective potential ( [ 1loopeff ] ) do not contribute to the potential for @xmath101 . only contribution to this effective",
    "potential comes from the last term with logarithmic divergence so that : v^_1loop ( h^_h ) ~-f^2 _    in order to have the sm symmetry breaking @xmath170 has to be negative .",
    "this can be ensured by including fermions ( for example a top quark ) with large yukawa couplings @xmath38 to scalars @xmath150 and @xmath151 which will also then , through graphs with fermion loops , contribute to both the quadratically and logarithmically divergent terms in ( [ 1loopeff ] ) and ( [ 1loopvev ] ) above so that @xmath171 and @xmath172 @xmath173 in such a way that @xmath174 .",
    "though we have not displayed them explicitly here , these fermions are essential to trigger the electro - weak symmetry breaking and hence have to be included in a complete description of the theory .",
    "negative @xmath170 allows the effective potential @xmath175 to have a minimum at a non - zero vacuum expectation value @xmath176 @xmath177f^2 $ ] @xmath178 . writing @xmath179",
    ", we find that sm symmetry breaking takes place leading to a mass for the standard higgs particle h as : m^2_h  ~  2(-a )  f^2 where @xmath180 .",
    "though ( mass)@xmath61 of higgs boson has only a logarithmic divergence at one loop level , it is also proportional to @xmath181 which does contain a quadratic divergence , @xmath182 .",
    "this brings in the quadratic divergences into the higgs mass . notice that this quadratic divergence comes with a factor of the coupling constant @xmath183 .",
    "this is yet another example of a _",
    "large _ logarithmically divergent radiative correction in addition to the one that was mentioned earlier in the context of the guts with widely separated scales in section 2 .",
    "now in order the mass of higgs particle be around @xmath107 , and for @xmath184 and @xmath185 , we have @xmath186 and the cut - off @xmath187 .",
    "there is a phenomenological difficulty with regard to the weak gauge boson mass in the little higgs model we have outlined above .",
    "the quartic coupling of the higgs field @xmath188 is too small and hence the weak gauge boson mass turns out to be too large , order @xmath189 .",
    "however , there are other little higgs models , like the ` littlest higgs model ' @xcite based on an @xmath190 sigma model , which do not suffer from such a limitation .    like the sm",
    ", little higgs models also suffer from naturalness problem .",
    "however , the scale of naturalness breakdown is about @xmath191 , an order of magnitude higher than that for the sm where , as discussed earlier in section 2 , it is only @xmath109 .",
    "this would mean that any new physics mass scale beyond @xmath192 , say that associated with the grand unification of strong and electro - weak forces , would destabilise this @xmath193 scale thus giving the electro - weak higgs boson a huge radiative correction characterised by the gut scale .",
    "there is nothing to protect the mass of this higgs boson from receiving such a large radiative correction .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the composite higgs boson and supersymmetric cases discussed in sections 3 and 4 .",
    "for example , despite the large value of the gut scale , in a supersymmetric framework , it does not destabilise the supersymmetry breaking scale at @xmath194 ; the electro - weak higgs boson does not receive huge radiative corrections from the gut scale .",
    "finally , in the little higgs models also , to have naturalness beyond this @xmath192 scale , some other mechanism needs to be invoked at this scale",
    ". this could be yet another little higgs mechanism operative at about @xmath191 to push the naturalness scale up by an order of magnitude to @xmath195 .",
    "there would have to be a ladder of such successive mechanisms .",
    "otherwise , supersymmetry or fermion - antifermion compositness of the higgs particle may appear at this scale .",
    "in particular , instead of @xmath109 supersymmetry for the sm , nature need have supersymmetry only at a higher scale of @xmath191 .",
    "alternatively , even for higgs boson mass around @xmath106 , the compositness scale for the forces binding new fermions into an effective higgs boson can be at a higher scale of about @xmath196 in contrast to the @xmath114 scale of conventional technicolour models discussed in section 3 .",
    "this allows for the possibilities of resolving the phenomenological difficulties faced by the old technicolour composite higgs models .",
    "there is yet another framework that addresses the electro - weak symmetry breaking with elementary scalar fields . in this framework , the four dimensional scalar fields are identified with the zero modes of extra - dimensional components of a higher dimensional gauge potential @xcite . when the extra dimensional space is not simply connected ( for example if it is @xmath197 ) , there are wilson line phases @xmath198 associated with the extra dimensional components of the gauge field , analog of aharanov - bohm phase in quantum mechanics .",
    "the four dimensional fluctuations of these phases are identified with higgs scalar fields .",
    "these are massless at tree level and acquire masses through radiative corrections as a finite - volume effect .",
    "when we probe the higgs boson with energies of the order of @xmath109 , the extra dimensions open up and we start seeing it as an extra - dimensional component of a higher dimensional gauge field . this framework is known as _ gauge - higgs unification_.    we could start with a five dimensional gauge theory containing fermions on a manifold @xmath199 with size of the compactified fifth dimension as @xmath200 .",
    "since the extra - dimensional component @xmath201 of the gauge fields are in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , the starting gauge group in the higher dimensional theory has to be large enough , say an @xmath149 or @xmath202 or @xmath203 , to accommodate the four dimensional higgs field of the @xmath204 sm model .",
    "the fifth components of momentum @xmath205 of both the gauge fields and fermions are discrete .",
    "these fields are expanded in terms of their kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes . at low energies we have an effective four dimensional theory obtained by integrating the action over the fifth dimension .",
    "this is a theory of massless zero modes of the fields and a tower of massive kk excitations for each field with their masses characterised by the kk mass scale @xmath206 and discrete values of the fifth component of momentum .",
    "quantum effects induce an effective four dimensional potential for the adjoint representation extra - dimensional components of the gauge field thereby breaking the gauge symmetry .",
    "these calculations have to include the radiative effects from all the various kk excitations .",
    "the answer would have divergences , naively even quadratic divergences .",
    "but these require special care with regularization .",
    "we have to adopt a regularization which allows for the fact that the extra - dimensional components are the fifth components of five dimensional gauge fields and in the limit @xmath207 , where we have five dimensional gauge symmetry , @xmath208 should be massless . this is not any different from the fact the photon self energy graphs in four dimensional electrodynamics have to be regularised in a gauge invariant manner so that the photon does not acquire a quadratically divergent mass and thereby break the gauge symmetry ; only a wave function renormalization is allowed .",
    "now in the present context , if we adopt a reasonable regularization , the effective potential for the extra - dimensional component of the gauge field turn out to be such that the bosonic ( gauge ) field loops tend to lead to a minimum of this effective potential at @xmath209 whereas the fermionic loops tend to draw this vacuum value away from zero .",
    "so if we arrange sufficiently many fermions in the theory we can have a radiatively generated symmetry breaking potential with its minimum at a non - zero value of order @xmath210 .",
    "this breaks the gauge symmetry .",
    "this way of breaking symmetry due to radiative corrections in a compactified higher dimensional gauge theory is known as _",
    "hosotani mechanism_. the mass of higgs boson so generated by the radiative corrections is of order @xmath211 .",
    "further it appears that the higgs boson mass may be finite to all orders in five dimensions suggesting that it is independent of the physics of the cut - off scale .",
    "it is important to note that in this gauge - higgs unification framework , in the limit @xmath207 , the higgs boson mass goes to zero and we have the five dimensional gauge symmetry .",
    "it is this five dimensional gauge symmetry which protects the smallness of higgs boson mass .",
    "however there are two difficulties with this framework : ( i ) the first problem faced is that the fermions in higher dimensional theory lead to vector theories in the reduced effective four dimensional theory at low energies instead of a theory with chiral fermions .",
    "this can be cured making the extra dimension have a non - trivial topology or allow for non - vanishing flux in the extra dimensions .",
    "we do have chiral fermions if the extra dimensional space is an orbifold , say @xmath212 , instead of a circle @xmath197 .",
    "the left - right asymmetry is achieved by appropriate orbifold boundary conditions so that the matter content of the sm is obtained in the effective low energy theory .",
    "( ii ) second problem is faced when contact is made with the required masses of the electro - weak theory .",
    "the mass scales of the theory , namely gauge boson masses @xmath213 and fermion masses as well as kk modes mass scale @xmath214 are all related and are order @xmath210 .",
    "the higgs boson mass is down by a factor of the weak coupling constant , @xmath215 where @xmath216 is the effective four dimensional gauge coupling which is related to the five dimensional gauge coupling @xmath217 as @xmath218 .",
    "this makes the kk energy scale rather low so that the masses of the low lying kk modes are same as that of weak gauge boson .",
    "in addition the mass of higgs boson is too low .",
    "this phenomenological difficulty arises mainly because the framework has been set up in flat five dimensional spacetime and could be circumvented if the theory was instead set in curved spacetime .",
    "both these problems get resolved by setting up the theory in the randall - sundrum ( rs ) warped five dimensional spacetime @xcite . in this space time",
    "extra dimensional space has the topology of orbifold @xmath212 of radius @xmath219 .",
    "we have here a five dimensional anti - de sitter space where the fifth dimension is an interval @xmath220 and with @xmath221 as the ads curvature .",
    "the boundaries of the interval are at the fixed points @xmath222 and @xmath223 where two three - branes , the so called planck or uv brane and tev or ir brane respectively , are located . induced metric on these boundaries differ by the exponential warp factor @xmath224 generating widely separated effective scales .",
    "at the planck brane @xmath225 , the effective four dimensional mass scale is of order the planck scale @xmath226 .",
    "on the other hand , the effective mass scale at the other brane at @xmath227 is @xmath228 .",
    "the low energy four dimensional effective action for the zero modes of the extra - dimensional gauge fields is such that that these zero - modes are localised near the tev - brane .",
    "the large warp factor @xmath229 relates the planck scale @xmath230 to electro - weak scale @xmath213 through @xmath231 for @xmath232 where @xmath233 and @xmath234 is the cosmological constant in the bulk five dimensional space time .",
    "thus rs spacetime provides a natural bridge between the planck scale and weak scale through the warp factor .",
    "the radius of compactification @xmath235 here , unlike the case of flat spacetime where it is of order @xmath236 , is not large ; it is instead as small as @xmath237 .",
    "this model has been studied for various five dimensional gauge groups like @xmath149 and @xmath238 @xcite with the latter having more satisfactory phenomenological properties , particularly those related to the physics of neutral currents of the electro - weak theory .",
    "the kk mass scale is given by @xmath239 which , for @xmath240 and @xmath241 , is of order @xmath242 .",
    "the kk spectrum is not equally spaced unlike in the flat spacetime case .",
    "the gauge boson and higgs boson masses are predicted to be @xcite : @xmath243 and @xmath244 .",
    "this makes the kk excitations to be sufficiently heavy and at the same time the gauge and higgs boson masses of acceptable values .    in the rs framework",
    "there is an alternative proposal where higgs boson is not the zero mode of a higher dimensional component of a gauge field but instead is an elementary scalar field .",
    "there are two versions of such theories : ( i ) the sm fields including the higgs field live on the tev brane , only gravity propagates in the five dimensional bulk @xcite ; and ( ii ) all the sm fields live in the bulk @xcite .    in the former case ,",
    "since effective momentum cut off near this brane is warped down from the five dimensional cut off @xmath245 to @xmath246 , radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass are cut off by this value .",
    "however care needs to be taken when all the contributions of kk modes of the five dimensional graviton are added .",
    "the zero mode of the graviton is the standard four dimensional graviton which has the standard gravitational coupling to the matter fields on the tev brane and this is small as @xmath247 .",
    "however the couplings of the kk gravitons with their masses given by the characteristic kk scale @xmath248 , are enhanced by the wrap factor to @xmath249 which is only @xmath250 .",
    "it is this large coupling that allows for the possibility that such kk gravitons of @xmath114 mass may be observed at a tev collider , lhc .",
    "but these large couplings also create a possible problem for the radiative corrections to the higgs boson mass from the tower of kk gravitons .",
    "such corrections to the higgs boson mass at the infra red brane are = ^_kk ( ) ^2 ( m^_pl  e^-k r ) ^2 = ^_kk ( tev)^-2   ( tev)^2 ~^_kk   1    indeed the effective four dimensional momentum cut off is @xmath251 .",
    "each term in this correction is small , but there is a sum over all the kk modes .",
    "this sum has to be done in a meaningful way so that result does not become large again .",
    "in the second case , where the sm fields including the higgs field live in the bulk , the tree - level bulk mass of the scalar field has to be small so that gauge bosons get reasonable masses of order @xmath106 .",
    "but radiatively its natural value is @xmath252 .",
    "this brings in the gauge hierarchy problem back in to the game @xcite .",
    "however introduction of supersymmetry again would protect mass of the higgs mode far from the tev - brane @xcite .",
    "such a model at low energy is more like the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .",
    "this is indeed a very bold proposal which needs some special care .",
    "one problem that requires to be addressed is the mechanism for fixing the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "particularly , this has to be done taking in to account the gravitational sector by including the five dimensional curved spacetime metric .",
    "the zero modes of this metric give four dimensional metric @xmath253 and the radion field @xmath254 whose vacuum value is the size @xmath219 of extra dimension . a possible proposal for the stablization of the size of extra dimension developed by goldberger and wise @xcite",
    "involves a massive five dimensional scalar field .",
    "equation of motion of this field is solved with appropriate boundary condition in the rs background .",
    "the solution in then put back into the action and extra dimension integrated out to get an effective potential for the modulus @xmath219 . the minimum of the potential fixes the stable size of the modulus to a value @xmath255 .",
    "however the back reaction of the scalar field need not be small and can spoil this stablization .",
    "also scalar fields mass being prone to problems from large quantum corrections , this needs some extra care .                  for reviews of technicolour see : e. farhi and l. susskind : phys .",
