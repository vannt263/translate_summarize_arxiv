    ", we note that @xmath31 forms a basis of global sections for the riemann  roch space of the divisor at infinity for the pair of coordinate functions @xmath32 , and that this basis determines a projective embedding @xmath33 in @xmath34 which is projectively normal ( see section 2 for precise definitions ) .",
