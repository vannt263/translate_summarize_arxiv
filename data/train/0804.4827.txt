    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are good candidates for constituents of a dark - matter halo around our galaxy , and a target of several experimental searches ( see e.g. @xcite for review ) .",
    "an annual oscillation in the signal at the level of 1 - 2% was recently confirmed by dama collaboration  @xcite .",
    "if the asymmetry is due to earth s motion around sun then much larger diurnal asymmetry in the wimp direction is expected  @xcite . however , the dama and other experiments that report zero signal  @xcite use liquid and solid detector materials that allow for more compact detectors , but destroy information on the wimp direction and the sense of direction ( ) .",
    "therefore , directionality is particularly valuable , both for suppressing background and for confirming the dama result by correlating a candidate dark - matter signal with astrophysical phenomena .",
    "reconstruction of the wimp direction can be accomplished with detectors using low - pressure gas as the target material .",
    "several groups , drift  @xcite , newage  @xcite , mimac  @xcite and dmtpc  @xcite have reconstructed low - momentum recoils created in elastic neutron scattering using low - pressure time - projection chambers for dark matter searches .",
    "the reconstruction of the sense of direction ( ) using the scintillation profile of a recoiling track has been only recently achieved  @xcite .",
    "the low density of gaseous detectors and the small wimp cross section necessitate the use of large detector volumes with fine detector granularities .",
    "a significant improvement of the current experimental limits may require a ton - scale detector . in the case of 4 as the detector material , one ton of gas occupies a volume of approximately @xmath0  m@xmath1 at 50  torr of pressure .",
    "a 50  kev fluorine recoil created in a wimp collision travels 1.5  mm at 50  torr of pressure .",
    "therefore , a multi - cubic meter detector with resolution of the order of hundreds of micrometers is needed for a directional dark matter experiment , requiring further progress in detector technology in order to observe wimps .",
    "in this paper we propose and demonstrate several designs for time - projection chambers that can be used in large - volume , directional dark matter search experiments with discrimination . in a time projection chamber",
    ", a wimp creates a nuclear recoil that makes electron - ion pairs as it slows down in the detector gas .",
    "we use 4 gas that has good charge multiplication and scintillation properties  @xcite .",
    "fluorine , in addition , has non - zero angular momentum , which allows probing for spin - dependent dark matter interactions .",
    "the electron diffusion limits the maximum drift distance to about 25  cm  @xcite .",
    "the initial ionization electrons drift in electric field toward the charge - amplification region , where in case of 4 , the threshold for charge multiplication is approximately 45  v/(@xmath2torr )  @xcite .",
    "traditionally , design choices for amplification regions have been based on the multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc )  @xcite , where strong electric fields are created in the vicinity of thin wires .",
    "the pitch between wires , and therefore the spatial resolution in mwpc is limited to above 1 - 2  mm due to mechanical and electrostatic reasons .",
    "finer spatial resolution can be achieved with micropattern detectors ( e.g. @xcite ) , but the size and the gain of detector modules are constrained by manufacturing limitations .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate designs for micropattern detectors that provide good gain , fine granularity and scalability to large volumes .",
    "electrodes used in the charge multiplication are made of woven meshes , indium - tin - oxide ( ito ) films , or copper .",
    "all designs allow production of large - area modules as the meshes and ito foils are produced in 1.2  m - wide rolls . in the first case shown in figure  [ fg::amplifier]a ) ,",
    "the amplification region is made of a stainless - steel mesh and copper - clad g10 board .",
    "the stainless steel mesh is made of 28  @xmath3 m diameter wires with periodicity of 256  @xmath3 m , which gives optical transmittance of 77% .",
    "woven meshes are used in air filtration systems and can be mass produced in a cost - effective way .",
    "the mesh and the copper - clad board are separated by fluorocarbon resistive ( fishing ) wires of 0.54  mm diameter and spaced every 2  cm , with transparency of 97% . with this design",
    ", we demonstrate the reconstruction of 2d recoil segments with improved gain and no additional cost compared to our previous detector .",
    "further improvement in gain may be achievable with the use of transparent electrodes that allow scintillation light to be read out from two sides .",
    "we test a design shown in figure  [ fg::amplifier]b ) , where the amplification electrodes are made of ito layers deposited on mylar foil and a stainless steel mesh .",
    "ito is 90:10 mix ratio , by weight , of indium - oxide ( in@xmath4o@xmath5 ) and tin - oxide ( sno@xmath4 ) , respectively .",
    "ito is widely used in consumer electronics ( e.g. touch screens , lcd screens ) and available in 1.2  m wide rolls of ito - coated mylar foils .",
    "the thickness of the ito coating determines electrical and optical properties of the foil : we use a surface resistance of 15 ohm/@xmath6 , which gives light transmittance of around 80% . in the third design shown in figure  [ fg::amplifier]c ) ,",
    "we use two meshes to create the amplification field and the same fluorocarbon wires to separate the planes .",
    "the transparency of electrodes can potentially increase the gain by almost a factor of two due to simultaneous readout of two drift volumes .",
    "the experimental setup with a time - projection chamber ( tpc ) and a ccd camera for optical readout  @xcite of the amplification plane is shown in figure  [ fg::tpc ] .",
    "the cathode mesh used to create the drift field has a periodicity of 312  @xmath3 m and wire thickness of 31  @xmath3 m , which gives an optical transparency of 88% .",
    "the drift distance is limited to approximatelly @xmath7 by the size of the vacuum vessel .",
    "the ccd camera is manufactured by finger lake instrumentation and equipped with a kodak kaf-0401me chip with a cooler that maintains the temperature in the range [ @xmath8,@xmath9  c to minimize electronic noise ( 25  adu ) .",
    "the photographic lens has an aperture ratio , f/ # of 0.95 , and a focal length of 25  mm .",

    "directional detection of dark matter requires large detector volumes with fine granularities .",
    "tpc modules filled with low - pressure 4 gas can provide directionality and directional sense , in particular for spin - dependent dark matter searches .",
    "we have demonstrated three possibilities for charge - amplification that allow directional detection and determination . in all three cases",
    "the gain is improved by more than an order of magnitude compared to the previous mwpc design  @xcite .",
    "this results in improvement in the discrimination due to the larger gain , 2d detection of recoil images , and reduced pressure from 200 to 75  torr , allowing for longer recoil tracks .",
    "we estimate the sensitivity for the wimp detection using standard assumptions about the dark matter halo  @xcite .",
    "cross - section limits for spin - dependent wimp scattering on proton are shown in figure  [ fg::wimp ] .",
    "we can improve current experimental limits  @xcite with approximately @xmath10 of 4 exposure , and test mssm models  @xcite with approximately @xmath11 . in both cases we assumed operation in an underground laboratory with a neutron - induced background rate of @xmath12  @xcite , uncorrelated with cygnus direction , and a 50  kev recoil - energy threshold .",
    "we plan to pursue these technologies and construct a cubic - meter module that will be a basic building block of a ton - scale detector .     of target mass - exposure in an underground laboratory .",
