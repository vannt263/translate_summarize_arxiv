    "chandra _ surveys , is the short average exposure time of the former studies : the xbootes pointings are 5 ks in duration , the xdeep2 survey is a series of 10 ks observations and a majority of the stripe 82 fields have exposure times under 10 ks . in figure [ hard_test ] right , we show the hard band log@xmath5-log@xmath6 for the @xmath82 deg@xmath0 of observations with exposure time exceeding 10 ks ( where the survey sensitivity to account for the subset of pointings has been updated accordingly ) .",
    "the normalization at high fluxes is clearly higher , though a siginficant disagreement still exists betweeen 2@xmath37 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 and 7@xmath37 erg @xmath4 s@xmath3 .",
    "these results indicate that exposure times can play a significant role in determining the source number counts at the high flux end in the hard , but not soft and full bands in _ chandra _ surveys .",
    "however , we note that though stripe 82 acx disagrees significantly over a limited flux range with champ in the hard band , it is consistent within the error bars compared to the other 4 surveys we consider .",
    "the full 17 deg@xmath0 survey data are needed to generate the high luminosity end of the x - ray qlf , but these stripe 82 acx log@xmath5-log@xmath6 relationships are an important first step towards that goal .",
    "an additional area up to 100 deg@xmath0 would be ideal for more precise qlf constraints , as well as the ability to study its evolution . for now , as we show below , the current number counts do preferentially trace the high luminosity agn population and we find many more of these sources in this pilot study than were detected in smaller area x - ray surveys .",
    "here we investigate the agn population found in stripe 82 acx prior to a time - intensive follow - up spectroscopic campaign . by combining the x - ray catalog with the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss )",
    ", we find that over half of the x - ray sources have optical counterparts and half of those have spectroscopic redshifts from existing optical catalogs , enabling identification of these x - ray sources .",
    "below , we comment on this agn population , comparing the parameter space in which these sources live with those found in smaller area surveys that have extensive spectroscopic follow - up .",
    "we also compare the agn we immediately identify with the population expected from theoretical predictions of agn population synthesis models .",
    "spectroscopic redshifts , or well constrained photometric redshifts , are necessary to robustly calculate x - ray luminosities .",
    "chandra _ source catalog provides a matched catalog of x - ray sources with sdss data release 7 @xcite .",
    "details of the matching algorithm are described in @xcite , who use the bayesian probabilistic algorithm presented in @xcite . in brief , for each possible association , a bayes factor is calculated using a positional uncertainty of 0.1@xmath47 for the sdss sources and a varying error for _ chandra _ sources based on the 95% accuracy limit . a uniform prior",
    "is then assumed , which is a function of the number of x - ray and optical sources as well as the number of true pairs .",
    "all sources in the cross - matched catalog are those where the probability of a match exceeds 50% .",
    "four hundred thirty _ chandra _ sources have optical counterparts in sdss , 11 of which have two possible optical counterparts .",
    "we have verified these matches by visual inspection and have removed optical counterparts that are saturated , contaminated by proximity to a bright non - point source , coincident with diffraction spikes , or are faint photometric sources from dr7 that do not have photometric detections in data release 8 ( dr8 ) . for the 11 x - ray objects with two possible optical counterparts , we chose the source with a higher probability of a match ( generally the brighter , closer source ) . this vetting yields 409 matched x - ray and optical sources , with redshifts from the following optical catalogs : sdss dr8 @xcite , sdss - iii @xcite , 2slaq @xcite , wigglez @xcite and the 4th release of the deep2 catalog @xcite .",
    "we find spectroscopic redshifts for 204 x - ray sources ( 186 from sdss dr8 and dr9 , 9 from 2slaq , 3 from wigglez and 6 from xdeep2 ) , of which 197 have l@xmath68 erg s@xmath3 ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) , and are therefore likely agn ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "here l@xmath69 represents the observed full band luminosity .",
    "of the 300 x - ray sources not detected in sdss dr7 , 107 were detected by wise ( lamassa et al .",
    ", 2013 , in prep . ) .",
    "these objects are candidates for elusive obscured high luminosity quasars and will be discussed in a follow - up paper .    in figure",
    "[ frac_opt ] , we plot the total number of x - ray sources and the subset with optical identifications and spectroscopic redshifts as a funcion of full band flux",
    ". interestingly , optical counterparts and spectroscopic identifications are found at all flux levels",
    ". the fraction of x - ray sources with optical associations and those with redshifts do increase with full band flux , but a low x - ray flux threshold where optical identifications become improbable is not apparent . consequently , follow - up spectroscopy will target sources at all x - ray fluxes .    in figure [ lum_z ] , we compare stripe 82 acx with the musyc survey of cdf - s + e - cdfs @xcite and c - cosmos @xcite to illustrate the value of larger areas in expanding the parameter space explored by pencil beam and moderate area surveys . here we focus only on x - ray - identified agn with spectroscopic redshifts in all surveys .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness between cdf - s + e - cdfs and stripe 82 acx is comparable , @xmath828% and @xmath829% , respectively ( 314 of 1134 x - ray sources have reliable spectroscopic redshifts , see cardamone et al .",
    "2010 for details ) ; c - cosmos has a higher level of spectroscopic completeness ( 48% ) .",
    "we note that the x - ray luminosities for stripe 82 acx and for cdf - s + e - cdfs are observed luminosities , while the c - cosmos luminosities have been k - corrected to the rest frame .",
    "we also include the predicted agn luminosity distribution for stripe 82 acx using the @xcite population synthesis model where the observed full band 0.5 - 7 kev area - flux curve was given as the model input .",
    "it is immediately apparent that the agn identified in stripe 82 acx are preferentially at high luminosities ( i.e. , l@xmath70 3@xmath71 erg s@xmath3 ) at all redshifts , including in the distant universe at @xmath22 .",
    "stripe 82 acx uncovers half again as many systems as c - cosmos beyond log(l@xmath69 ) of 44.5 dex ( 83 vs. 57 ) , although c - cosmos has a higher level of spectroscopic completeness due to a long - term dedicated follow - up campaign .",
    "though over 100 @xmath14 agn have been identified by _",
    "chandra_-cosmos and @xmath14 quasar luminosity functions have been generated using x - ray data from _",
    "chandra_-cosmos @xcite , _ xmm - newton_-cosmos @xcite , and the _ chandra _ deep field south @xcite , all these sources have faint to moderate luminosities .",
    "wide - area surveys like stripe 82 acx are essential to locate rare , l@xmath72 erg s@xmath3 quasars , which is necessary to populate the high end of the x - ray qlf .",
    "the @xcite population synthesis model indicates that 580 agn should be located within the 6.2 deg@xmath0 survey area , 137 of which are at high luminosities ( l@xmath70 3@xmath71 erg s@xmath3 ) and 75 beyond a redshift of 2 .",
    "figure [ lum_z ] indicates a majority of the yet - to - be classified agn are at moderate luminosities .",
    "we have found more than half of the expected high luminosity agn ( 83 out of 137 ) and a third of those at @xmath22 ( 25 of 75 ) . according to the model predictions , 56 of the @xmath22 agn are luminous sources ( l@xmath73 dex ) ; we have immediately identified half ( 23 ) of these .",
    "our observational results further indicate that population synthesis models can be better refined with our survey data .",
    "only 580 agn are predicted in stripe 82 acx though @xmath8700 x - ray sources lie within this region . though stars , normal galaxies and x - ray binaries contribute to the total number of x - ray sources , such non - agn are not numerous enough to explain the discrepancy between the predictions and observations .",
    "additionally , as shown in figure [ lum_z ] , more extremely luminous agn ( i.e. , l@xmath74 erg s@xmath3 ) are found than accounted for in this model . indeed , the paucity of known agn at high x - ray luminosities is the reason stripe 82 x is needed .",
    "we have presented the first 6.2 deg@xmath0 of the current @xmath817 deg@xmath0 x - ray survey covering sdss stripe 82 .",
    "this pilot work concerns the analysis of archival _ chandra _ observations in the region ( stripe 82 acx ) .",
    "we utilized source lists and products generated and provided by the _",
    "chandra _ source catalog @xcite , and the extensive multiwavelength data available in stripe 82 , which greatly streamlined the analysis compared with previous x - ray surveys .",
    "our main results are summarized as follows :    * stripe 82 acx reaches approximate flux limits of 1.2@xmath2 , 5.4@xmath2 and 2.9@xmath2 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , with half area survey coverage at fluxes of 1.5@xmath37 , 4.8@xmath37 and 2.9@xmath37 erg s@xmath3 @xmath4 , in the soft ( 0.5 - 2 kev ) , hard ( 2 - 7 kev ) and full ( 0.5 - 7 kev ) bands , respectively .",
    "we detect a total of 709 unique x - ray sources , with 480 , 137 and 705 sources at the 4.5@xmath1 level in the soft , hard and full bands .",
    "of these , 214 were detected solely in the full band and 4 sources detected only in the soft band .",
    "* the number counts for stripe 82 acx are euclidean at high fluxes .",
    "our soft and full band log@xmath5-log@xmath6 relations are consistent with the predictions from @xcite and with previous _",
    "chandra _ x - ray surveys : ecdf - s @xcite , c - cosmos @xcite , xdeep2 @xcite , xbootes @xcite and champ @xcite .",
    "we agree with the xdeep2 and xbootes hard band number counts , but all three are somewhat systematically lower than other surveys .",
    "we show that this discrepancy may be due to exposure times , indicating that the length of observations may have a significant impact on the high flux end of the hard band log@xmath5-log@xmath6 from _ chandra _ surveys . *",
    "409 _ chandra _ sources are matched to optical counterparts in the sdss .",
    "we obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 204 of these x - ray objects from sdss dr8 @xcite , sdss - iii @xcite , 2slaq @xcite , wigglez @xcite and deep2 @xcite .",
    "one hundred ninety - seven of these objects have x - ray luminosities consistent with agn ( i.e. l@xmath75 erg s@xmath3 ) ; 83 of these are at high luminosity ( l@xmath76 erg s@xmath3 ) and 25 are at @xmath22 . * we compared the agn luminosity distributions from stripe 82 acx with cdf - s + e - cdfs @xcite and c - cosmos @xcite ; e - cdfs + cdf - s has similar level of spectroscopic completeness with stripe 82 acx while c - cosmos has a somewhat higher level of spectroscopic completeness .",
    "this comparison shows that the agn we immediately identify represent the high luminosity ( l@xmath70 3@xmath71 erg s@xmath3 ) population , at all redshifts , including beyond @xmath22 , while smaller surveys preferentially locate more moderate luminosity agn . * using population synthesis models from @xcite and the full - band area - flux curve in stripe 82 acx , we have demonstrated that more than half of the high luminosity agn expected to lie in the survey area have been identified prior to any follow - up spectroscopic campaign .",
    "we find a third of the high redshift ( @xmath22 ) agn and half of the luminous agn at high redshift that are predicted to lie within stripe 82 acx . slight disagreements between model predictions and our observational results indicate that population synthesis models need to be refined to better accommodate the high luminosity agn population .",
    "this result affirms the importance of a large volume x - ray survey like stripe 82 x , which will provide important constraints for these models .",
